# a b s t r a c t

Critical reflection is considered a highly valued graduate attribute in higher education. Assignments that assess critical reflection skills often require students to focus on subjective and personal experiences, attitudes and dispositions. In addition to being typically less valued than objective and theoretical knowledge, reflective writing is often viewed as unstructured and ‘creative’, therefore challenging to teach and learn. This paper makes visible the means by which high-achieving students in social work and business successfully engage with subjective meanings in reflective writing. Drawing on the Appraisal framework from Systemic Functional Linguistics, this paper shows how successful students move from common sense understanding of problematic situations to demonstrating discplinary knowledge and values in their fields of study. The paper concludes with consolidating the findings to make visible successful critical reflection practices as well as associated ethical concerns in order to advance equitable outcomes in higher education.

# 1. Introduction

Teaching and assessing critical thinking through assignments designed to foster sub-skills such as ‘critical reflection’ have become increasingly popular across a range of applied disciplines, such as nursing (Epp, 2008; Smith, 2011), teacher education (Blaise et al., 2004; Hume, 2009; Mills, 2008; Otienoh, 2009), early childhood education (Cornish & Cantor, 2008), psychology (Sutton et al., 2007), business and management education (Carson & Fisher, 2006; Fischer, 2003; Swan & Bailey, 2004), social work and health sciences (Fook, 2002; Fook & Askeland, 2007). Reflective writing tasks are typically used in applied disciplinary fields in professions in which events are “unpredictable and irreversible” and where there are no “controlled conditions for experimentation” (Nesi & Gardner, 2012, p. 222). Students are thus asked “to reflect on past performances in order to improve their future practice” (Nesi & Gardner, 2012, p. 222). These assessments also focus on the ability of students to transform ‘knowledge-in-waiting’ to ‘knowledge-in-use’ (Gulwadi, 2009, p. 44) as preparation for transferring skills learned in their undergraduate degrees to the workplace. From the perspective of higher education practices, this means that critical reflection assignments require students to bring their personal experiences of professional practice to the forefront, giving primacy to information that is typically dismissed in professional education as “merely anecdotal” or “hopelessly subjective and impressionistic” (Brookfield, 1998, p. 198). In this article, we examine how students write successful ‘critical reflection essays’ and ‘learning journals’ in the field of social work and business. Specifically, we focus on how successful student writers across disciplines engage with the subjective content valued in critical reflection assignments by demonstrating their capacity to deploy formulaic patterns of evaluative meaning that are stabilised through the course of reflective texts. These findings contribute to the growing field of research concerned with the explicit teaching of ‘transferable’ skills such as demonstrating a capacity for ‘self-reflection’. In this paper we draw specifically on a sociosemiotic approach to examining English discourse that constitutes valued knowledge practices.

# 2. Critical reflection assessment: pedagogical research

Critical reflection refers to how people make “judgements about whether professional activity is equitable, just and respectful of persons or not’ by drawing on ‘personal action” examined within wider socio-historical and politico-cultural contexts (Hatton & Smith, 1994, p. 35). As a ‘soft’ (Biglan, 1973a, 1973b) or ‘transferable’ (Brown, 1990; Halpern, 1998; Kek & Huijser, 2011) skill, it is often taught and assessed through the use of a wide variety of assignments, such as learning and reflective journals and reports, reflection essays, case studies, or narratives (Carson & Fisher, 2006; Fook & Gardner, 2013; Fook et al., 2006; Ryan & Ryan, 2013). In this paper, in order to distinguish the process of critical reflection from the written assignments, we will use the term ‘critical reflection’ to name the process and ‘critical reflection assignments’ to refer to “written documents that students create as they think about various concepts, events, or interactions over a period of time for the purposes of gaining insights into self-awareness and learning” (Thorpe, 2004, p. 328 as cited in O’Connell & Dyment, 2011, p. 47). These assignments typically require students to identify a personal and “disorienting dilemma” (Mezirow, 1990) or a “critical incident” 1 (Fook, 2002) during the practical application of their disciplinary knowledge in field work, field placements and other ‘real-life’ scenarios students engage in during their undergraduate degrees. Critical incidents or learning events are often ‘narrated’ in the form of an “autobiography” or “life narrative” (Creme, 2008) that then forms the object of analysis in critical reflection assignments. In applied disciplines such as social work and business, the narration of the critical incident is typically followed by a deconstruction or analysis of “assumptions” (Fook, 2002) about practice through the application of theoretical knowledge in high-scoring student assignments. Critical reflection tasks are thus intended to present students with an opportunity to externalise and investigate core values and power relations inherent in their roles as practitioners (Brookfield, 2001, p. 301).

One important difference between critical reflection assignments and more traditional forms of assessment is that students are required to engage with their emotions and express their opinions. Engagement with emotions in critical reflection assignments lies in contrast to the traditional understanding of learning as “objective”, “theoretical”, “rational”, “competitive”, “adversarial” and “individualistic” (Fook et al., 2016, p. 527). Instead, these assignments typically engage with the less valued processes of “personal experience disclosure” within “supportive group environments” which involve “emotions” and encourages “divergent and ambigious thinking” (Fook et al., 2016, p. 527). During the process of deconstructing assumptions, student are expected to find a connection between “personal and emotional concerns” that emerge during their critical incidents and the theoretical content covered in course material (Creme, 2008, p. 60). This expectation to engage with their emotions has resulted in critical reflection assignments becoming a space in which to “vent frustrations” in a safe and healthy manner (Hiemstra, 2001; Moon, 2006). The process of critical reflection is therefore described as being both “cathartic” (Sutton et al., 2007) and “highly emotional” (Ghaye, 2007) for students.

This shift from the objective and theoretical nature of traditional written assignments in tertiary education to engagement with the emotive has resulted in a number of issues for both teaching and learning. This is despite the fact that there are a number of ‘models’ of critical reflection which attempt to explain the process (see for instance Boud et al., 1985; Gibbs, 1988; Kolb, 1981; Schon, 1991 € ). Frameworks such as Gibb’s reflective cycle use probing questions (e.g. what were you thinking and feeling? what was good and bad about the experience?) to guide students to describe their feelings about their chosen critical incident (Gibbs, 1988). Yet students are given few examples of how these emotions and opinions are realised in the form of academic discourse in text and what kinds of evaluative meanings are valued in the context of higher education. As a result, teachers have drawn attention to the fact that reflective tasks are difficult to teach and assess because they deal with ‘personal issues’ and little is known about their actual content and structure. In fact, a number of theorists propose that critical reflection assignments are “creative” (Creme, 2005  ), providing students with the opportunity for “self-expression” (Hettich, 1990; Hiemstra, 2001). In order to allow the process of critical reflection to remain ‘authentic’, some teachers are reluctant to provide students with adequate structural support and explicit instruction which may lead to better quality reflective writing (O’Connell & Dyment, 2011). Students have also critiqued critical reflection tasks as “tedious”, “busy work” and “just a nuisance”, not suited to an education setting (Mills, 2008) despite the fact that research in higher education proposes that these assignments are viewed as ‘transformative’ and ‘emancipatory’ (Mezirow, 1991).

Elsewhere, we argued that due to the predominant focus on ‘thinking’ and ‘cognitive skills’ (see, for instance, Ennis,1993; Facione, 1990, 1992) the knowledge practices that underlie critical reflection assessment are largely ignored (Szenes, Tilakaratna & Maton, 2015). We argued for the need to move past the focus on ‘perceptions’ of what constitutes critical reflection to examining ‘practices’ in successful student texts. We then examined how students move between technical knowledge and personal experience in a way that is valued in their subject areas. A number of recent publications have engaged with linguistic and sociological approaches to uncovering what constitutes knowledge practices of critical reflection across a range of disciplines such as nursing (Brooke, 2019), engineering and English for Academic Purposes (Brooke, Monbec & Tilakaratna, 2019) and social work and business (Tilakaratna & Szenes, 2017, 2020). To understand the nature of successful critical reflection as evidenced by high-scoring students’ texts in two applied disciplines, social work and business, our analysis aims at uncovering some of the key evaluative resources students use to navigate between the personal and theoretical aspects of critical reflection. In this article we contribute to this growing body of research by focussing on how successful students engage with ‘subjective’ knowledge by examining the evaluative resources they deploy to construe ‘emotion’ and ‘opinion’ in successful critical reflection tasks in the disciplines of social work and business.

We begin by challenging current pedagogical practices which claim that critical reflection constitutes a form of ‘adult play’ and a ‘creative activity’ that allow students “to play around with ideas in an open, unworried and exploratory way” (Creme, 2008, p. 52). In order to do this, we uncover how successful students in the applied disciplines of business and social work move through particular stages in their reflective assignments and reveal how these stages draw on specific and similar evaluative resources to reach the objectives of analysing personal experiences and then transforming practice. The recurring patterns of evaluative meaning that unfold in each stage are uncovered through our analysis of the linguistic resources successful students use to deal with their ‘emotions’ and ‘opinions’ in critical reflection tasks. Finally, we will show how successful student writers technicalise their personal emotions and opinions to engage with larger theoretical meanings that are valued in their fields of study. To demonstrate how evaluative resources are deployed in these assignments, we draw on the framework of APPRAISAL informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics (hereafter: SFL) to identify and classify the different kinds of attitude that successful students use in their assignments.

# 3. The theoretical framework for classifying evaluative language: APPRAISAL

In order to describe the evaluative resources deployed by successful students in writing critical reflection assignments, we draw on the SFL discourse semantic system of APPRAISAL, 2 often referred to as ‘the language of evaluation’ (Martin & White, 2005). APPRAISAL is used in this study to determine accumulated positive or negative values that are built up over the course of exemplary critical reflection assignments. In other words, we are interested in understanding what kinds of evaluative language students use and what they target in order to demonstrate successful engagement with both emotion and opinion in critical reflection assignments.

The APPRAISAL framework consists of three interacting domains: ATTITUDE, GRADUATION and ENGAGEMENT. ATTITUDE can be further divided into the sub-systems of AFFECT (evaluating emotions/feelings), (JUDGEMENT) (evaluating behaviours) and APPRECIATION (evaluating things/phenomena). GRADUATION is a resource for grading evaluation through amplifying feelings or blurring categories (Martin & White, 2005, p. 35). Finally, ENGAGEMENT deals with the source of attitudes and how they are managed within text. Fig. 1 below illustrates these three interacting sub-systems.

In more common-sense terms, we can differentiate between these domains of ATTITUDE by distinguishing between types of ‘emotion’ to refer to attitudinal assessments indicated through descriptions of “emotional reactions” or “states of human subjects” and the term ‘opinion’ to refer to “positive or negative assessments” (White, 2004). Bednarek (2008) draws on this distinction to classify AFFECT as types of ‘emotion’ while JUDGEMENT and APPRECIATION are what she refers to as forms of ‘opinion’. This classification of ATTITUDE into types of ‘emotions’ and ‘opinions’ is critical for understanding the resources deployed by students writing critical reflection assignments. In contrast to other types of assessments, in critical reflection tasks students are expected to share their feelings and emotions regarding the critical incident they experience and judge the behaviour and roles of the different participants involved in the incident. This means that students should deploy a range of attitudinal evaluations moving effectively from emotion to opinion as the assignment unfolds. In this paper we focus on the two domains of attitudinal resources that enact emotion and opinions of people’s behaviour: AFFECT and JUDGEMENT.

Fig. 1. The resources of APPRAISAL (Fig. 1.18 adapted from Martin & White, 2005, p. 38).

Language resources of AFFECT construe positive and negative emotions, reactions and feelings such as inclination, happiness/unhappiness, security/insecurity and satisfaction/dissatisfaction. Choices of AFFECT can be realised as a quality (a sad captain), a process (he missed them) or comment (sadly, he had to go) (Martin & White, 2005, p. 46). In addition, AFFECT can also express emotions that are intentions, for instance, ‘desire’ (she wanted chocolate). Typically, expressions of AFFECT involve a conscious participant who experiences a particular emotion, the Emoter, while the Trigger is what brings about that emotion (Martin & White, 2005, p. 47), as in Examples 1 and 2 below:

[1] I [Emoter] was uncomfortable [eaffect] at being the centre of attention [Trigger] [2] The critical incident [Trigger] that challenged [eaffect] me [Emoter] took place during my field placement.

Choices from the subsystem of JUDGEMENT realise attitudes towards people and their behaviour. These evaluation choices relate to social esteem, concerned with normality (how un/usual someone is), capacity (how capable they are), and tenacity (how resolute they are); and social sanction, associated with veracity (how truthful someone is) and propriety (how ethical someone is), i.e. values that underpin “civic duty and religious observances” (Martin & White, 2005, p. 52). As illustrated by Examples 3 and 4 below, judgement can be attributed to a source or the Appraiser and typically targets a thing that will be referred to as the Target (i.e. the Appraised).

[3] From my perspective [Appraiser] his request [Target] was inappropriate [ejudgement]. [4] I feel as though revealing my mistakes [Target] is a sign of failure [ejudgement] e a verification of my inadequacies [ejudgement] as a ‘professional’.

In addition to inscribed instances of AFFECT and JUDGEMENT, ATTITUDE can also be realised indirectly. Indirect realisations are referred to as invoked attitude and can be subdivided into two types: provoked or invited. Provoked attitude is realised by lexical metaphors (e.g. he made me feel like a piece of meat). Invited attitude can be further subdivided into flagged attitude where attitude is signaled by instances of graduation (e.g. I received more attention than I could have anticipated) or afforded by a selection of ideational meanings (e.g. wolf-whistling boys).

A further aspect of APPRAISAL that we need to take into consideration is the fact that items of evaluation and their Targets, Triggers, Emoters and Appraisers can combine in ways “in which meanings combine, as pairs, triplets, quadruplets or any number of coordinated choices from system networks3 ” (Martin, 2008, p. 39). These types of combinations, termed coupling in SFL, consist of “the linking of at least two types of relations at one point” in an unfolding text (Zhao, 2010, p. 206). As all evaluations are aimed at something, it is equally important to study what is being evaluated (Martin & White, 2005, p. 59), i.e. the Targets of evaluation.

SFL research on evaluation has examined couplings in relation to APPRAISAL and their Targets (Hood, 2010; Knight, 2010) as they begin to stabilise over the course of a text. Uncovering which collocational meanings stabilise over the course of a text to become couplings reveals the “genesis4 of a particular value position in an ideal reader” (Macken-Horarik, 2003, p. 319). It is this genesis of a value position that we are concerned with in this article as we argue that high-scoring students have the capacity not only to use a range of evaluative resources effectively, but also to make themselves the sources and targets of evaluation so that their emotions and their behaviour function as the objects of study. It is the process of evaluating the self and showing a shift in attitude from emotions to opinions through the unfolding stages of the text that appears to be a crucial component of demonstrating the transformation of the undergraduate social worker or business student into a full-fledged practitioner in their respective fields.

Following Martin and White (2005) and Hood (2010), in this paper instances of ‘ATTITUDE’ will be analysed as inscribed if they explicitly encode gradable positive or negative values. Attitudinal inscriptions will be coded in black bold font; invoked attitude will be coded in italics and their Targets (i.e. the appraised entities) will be underlined. Their valence (i.e. charging) will be indicated by the signs $\cdot _ { + } \cdot$ for positive and ‘e’ for negative evaluation. Resources of graduation as well as implicit or invoked attitudinal meanings instantiated through the resources of graduation will be coded in black bold italics. Choices selected from the different sub-systems of APPRAISAL will be indicated by square brackets (e.g. $\cdot +$ affect]. Following SFL labeling conventions (see e.g. Halliday & Matthiessen, 2004), we indicate clause boundaries by double vertical bars (’||‘) and embedded clauses by double square brackets (’[[…]]’). This coding scheme is summarized in Table 1.

This paper will follow the visual representation of couplings that appears in [Szenes, 2017], (adapted from Hood, 2010, pp. 143e144), where a yin-yang symbol is used to represent the combining of attitudinal meanings and their Targets. Example 5 below illustrates a coupling where an instance of negative judgement (impatient) functions to spread negative charging over its Target, person:

[5] The values of integrity and egalitarianism, I think, underpin my old weakness as an impatient [ejudgement] person [Target] towards ‘free-loaders’.

Fig. 2 below shows this coupling of attitudinal meaning and its Target as a yin-yang symbol, with the negative attitudinal inscription above its Target in order to show the domination of the prosodic value.

A closer look at the clause shown in Example 5 above reveals that the coupling an impatient person itself is further evaluated as an old weakness by an instance of inscribed negative [ejudgement: capacity]. The evaluation of a coupling is termed ‘recoupling’; its visual representation is a two-layered yin-yang symbol, which functions to capture the attitudinal value colouring the coupling of a ‘lower order’ (Szenes, 2017). Fig. 3 below shows that the coupling an impatient person has now become the Target of the negative judgement encoded by the instance old weakness.

We begin with a description of the genre of the social work and business critical reflection assignments and the evaluative resources deployed across each stage of the texts. This will be followed by a discussion of the kinds of evaluative language valued in critical reflection assignments across different applied disciplines and an overview of the implications for peda gogical practices.

# 4. Description of the data

In order to study successful demonstrations of critical reflection, we were interested in analysing high-scoring undergraduate student assignments from the fields of social work and business. As they were considered ‘model’ answers, six highscoring third-year undergraduate critical reflection essays (3000 words) were selected to be published as an edited collection of high-scoring CREs titled Critical reflection: Generating theory from practice (Pockett & Giles, 2008). After gaining ethics approval for the project, 64 first-year undergraduate reflective journals from business studies (1000 words) were collected from the core senior interdisciplinary unit Business in the Global Environment5 at a large metropolitan Australian university. However, due to the time-consuming nature of fine-grained SFL-informed manual text analyses (including detailed genre and discourse semantic analysis), a decision was made to narrow the data set down. All grades awarded to student reflective journals were exported into an Excel spreadsheet and ordered from highest to lowest. The 12 highest-scoring assignments were then chosen for analysis. Thus, the combined word count for the two sets of texts described above is approximately 30,000 words. For reasons of space, in the following sections we will showcase one exemplary critical reflection assignment from each discipline to illustrate recurring linguistic patterns observed across the data set.

# 4.1. A description of the social work critical reflection essay

The purpose of the social work critical reflection essay (hereafter: CRE) was to prepare students for operationalizing critical reflection in order to “create new professional knowledge” (Pockett & Giles, 2008). Students were required to focus on their “emerging identity as “new graduate social workers’ about to enter the workplace” and were asked to ‘select a critical incident from their fieldwork experience and using Fook’s critical incident technique (Fook, 2002, pp. 98e100) analyse the incident through deconstruction and, using reconstruction, develop new practice theories” (p. xiv). In order to help students “maximise the learning they might make” and “interpret and guide the reflective process”, they were provided with Fook’s (2002) model of critical deconstruction and reconstruction (Pockett & Giles, 2008) The model consists of four stages:

1) critical deconstruction involves “searching for contradictions, different perspectives and interpretations” (p. 92);   
2) resistance involves “refusing to accept or participate in aspects of dominant discourses which work to disempower, or perhaps render a situation unworkable because of this” (p. 95);   
3) challenge involves “identification or labeling of both the existence and operation of discourses and that which is hidden, glossed over or assumed” (p. 96);   
4) reconstruction, which “involves formulating new discourses and structures” (p. 96).

4.1.1. Genre analysis of social work critical reflection essays

Drawing on a systemic-functional understanding of genre as a “staged, goal oriented social process” (Martin & Rose, 2008, p. 6), our genre analysis identified five distinct stages in the student’s essay: to achieve its social purpose the text moves through three obligatory stages (Critical Incident, Excavation and Transformation) and can include two optional stages (Introduction and Coda). In this paper we focus on the obligatory genre stages, which will be discussed in greater detail below.

(Introduction ^ ) Critical Incident ^ Excavation ^ Transformation ( ^ Coda)

In the Critical Incident stage of the essay, the writer narrates a difficult experience encountered during her field placement when, as a young female apprentice social worker, she was subjected to verbal sexual harassment by a young male patient (Jared) attending a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. In the following Excavation stage she contrasts her initial reaction (to report the incident and the resulting consequences for the male client) with her understanding of the incident based on her reflection from a disciplinary perspective. In the final Transformation stage the student elaborates on what changes need to be made to her practice and subsequently how she has been ‘transformed’ through the process of critical reflection. Table 2 below maps the model of critical reflection outlined by Fook (2002) in relation to the rhetorical structure of the CRE signaled by global text headings and the corresponding generic stages.

# 4.2. Description of a reflective journal in business studies

Our second text is a reflective journal of a senior undergraduate in the Bachelor of Commerce Unit of Study, Business in the Global Environment at a large metropolitan Australian university. One of the central aims of this challenging interdisciplinary unit was to equip students with the skills of reflective and analytic judgment as well as intercultural competence to develop an awareness of the external global business environment (CISS2001 UoS Outline, 2008). In particular, the reflective journal assignment was designed to develop students’ reflective practice and specifically their intercultural competence, which was defined in the Unit of Study Outline as “a dynamic ongoing interactive self-reflective learning process that transforms attitudes, skills and knowledge for effective communication and interaction across cultures and contexts” (Freeman, 2009; emphasis added). In this task, students were required to critically reflect on their experience of multinational teamwork by examining their visible and invisible values, beliefs, assumptions and behaviours based on Solomon and Schell’s (2009) model of intercultural competency (pp. 49e50) and were provided with the following questions:

Question 1: Choose one behaviour that you thought was a strength or weakness and identify the ‘below the surface’ value that underpins that behaviour.

Question 2: Having identified the cultural value that you believe underpins your particular strength or weakness, now explain how and from where that cultural value developed using the ‘core elements of culture’ provided on page 50 of Solomon and Schell.

Question 3: What does this teach you about the way you behave, and your expectations of others, when working in multinational teams?

Question 4: How might you integrate this awareness into future team work, either at university or in the workplace?

In order to fully understand how critical reflection is actually evidenced in student writing guided by these questions, it is important to examine what kind of evaluative language resources successful students have employed in their reflective journals order to demonstrate their skills of intercultural competency valued in the field of business.

# 4.2.1. Genre analysis of business reflective journals

Three distinct obligatory stages were identified in the highest scoring business reflective journal. They are as follows:

Excavation ^ Reflection ^ Transformation

In the Excavation stage, based on Solomon and Schell’s (2009) theoretical framework of culture, the writer identifies the value of individualism as a ‘below the surface’ value that underpinned his ‘discounting’ of teammates’ opinions with regards to a group assignment. To analyse this value and reflect on his experiences about working in a multinational team in the subsequent Reflection stage, the student concludes that it was opposing individualism with his international non-English speaking background peers’ value of communitarianism that resulted in his inappropriate and ignorant behaviour. Finally, in the Transformation stage the student writer pledges that in future teamwork situations his behaviour will be guided by newly acquired intercultural competence skill that he gained by this reflective process. We now turn to exploring the role of attitudinal resources in the construction of critical reflection valued in social work and business, the focus of the following section.

# 5. The role of ATTITUDE choices in reflective writing

In this section we illustrate how successful social work and business student writers deploy different types of evaluative resources to express the kinds of ATTITUDE that are valued within their respective fields, ranging from personal emotions to opinions about professional practice.

# 5.1. Emotional reactions to a problematic incident

One of the key resources that students draw on in their critical reflection tasks is those selected from the sub-system of AFFECT. Students use a range of negative affectual inscriptions to share their emotional reactions to a problematic incident that they faced in their fieldwork or classroom context. In the case of the social work CRE, these instances of emotional reaction are primarily situated in the Critical Incident and Excavation stages where the student narrates how the client’s verbal sexual advancements resulted in her negative emotional response. Specifically, the student writes about her reaction to the client’s comment (“I will if you give us a kiss”) in response to her request that he help her in the kitchen. In the Critical Incident stage, the student primarily draws on resources of AFFECT and particularly subtypes of [insecurity: disquiet] to share her feelings of anxiety about the critical incident:

[6] The critical incident [Trigger] that shook me [Emoter] up [insecurity: disquiet] and challenged [insecurity: disquiet] me [Emoter] both personally and professionally occurred in one of my placements in a large government agency for young people.   
[7] I [Emoter] felt uncomfortable [insecurity: disquiet] at being the centre of attention and specifically sexual attention [Trigger].

Further instances of AFFECT include [esurprise] where the student shows how unexpected the client’s reaction to her request was, followed by feelings of [antipathy] triggered by her objectification:

[8] The attention [Trigger] startled [esurprise] me [Emoter] for various reasons.   
[9] I [Emoter] resented [unhappiness: antipathy] being seen as an ‘object’ [Trigger].

As she moves from the Critical Incident stage to the Excavation stage, the student continues to construe emotions of [affect: insecurity: disquiet] as repeatedly triggered by the critical incident, illustrated in Table 3.

Table 3 illustrates how AFFECT resources change from the Critical Incident stage to the Excavation stage: a significant shift occurs from the focus on the individual (I) and the incident (the critical incident, it) to the foregrounding of the incident only. This shift signals the student’s movement from more personal, subjective concerns recounted in the Critical Incident, to constructing the incident as the object of study analysed in relation to social work theory in the Excavation.

In the business reflective journal, the student’s emotional reactions only appear in the Reflection stage of the assignment, where he reflects on his behaviour towards his international non-English speaking background peers during a multinational teamwork situation. While the first stage of the social work CRE is saturated with emotions of unhappiness, antipathy and negative surprise, in the business reflective journal the student’s negative stereotyping of his peers is evaluated by only one instance of inscribed and one instance of invoked [eaffect: surprise]6 :

[10] I [Emoter] was surprised [eaffect: surprise] || that my long held belief [[that the vast majority of the world adopted individualism as a value]] was incorrect [Trigger].

Fig. 4. Stabilised coupling of negative affect and the critical incident across two reflective assignments.

In both disciplines, what seems to be valued is the student’s disclosure of uncertainty triggered by another person’s or a team’s behaviour, which form the ‘disorienting dilemma’ (Mezirow, 1990) or a ‘critical incident’ (Fook, 2002) that critical reflection literature refers to. We can formalise this pattern as the first coupling that stabilises across both texts as shown in Fig. 4: the instances of [eaffect] are always sourced to the student as the Emoter while the critical incident functions as the Trigger.

This section has presented an overview of AFFECT resources deployed across the Critical Incident and Excavation stages of the social work CRE and the Reflection stage of the business reflective journal, which function to evaluate the students’ initial responses to the problematic incident, the object of analysis. In addition to disclosing negative emotions triggerred by their critical incidents, both students deploy a range of opinions in the form of JUDGEMENT resources, which will be explored in greater detail in the following section.

# 5.2. Negative judgements of behaviour

In both critical reflection assigments the student writers negatively evaluate the inappropriate behaviour of the clients and team members. In the social work CRE, the student social worker’s clients have engaged in sexual harassment during her placement. In the Critical Incident stage, she negatively judges this behaviour through instances of both invoked and inscribed [ejudgement: propriety], shown in Table 4 below.

Similar to the student social worker, the business student also negatively evaluates his peers’ behaviour in the Reflection stage of the reflective journal. From their cultural differences to their communication style, the local Australian business student judges the ‘normality’ of his peers from mainland China as ‘foreign’. Similar couplings of [ejudgement: normality] are shown in Table 5 below.

We can generalise and formalise these linguistic resources of negative judgement which target the behaviour of other participants in the text as a further coupling that is stabilised during the Critical Incident and Reflection stages of both assignments. Fig. 5 below represents this coupling of the students’ [ejudgement] targeting their client/team.

After the students from both disciplines negatively evaluate other participants in the text, they proceed to examine on what basis they formed these negative assesssments of their clients’ and team mates’ behaviours. For the social work student, this originates from the ‘deconstruction’ stage of Fook’s model, where she is required to search for “contradictions, different perspectives and interpretations” (Fook, 2002, p. 92). This deconstruction occurs in the Excavation stage of the social work CRE, where the student re-examines the critical incident in relation to her lack of experience as a professional social worker. From the perspective of professional social work theory, she questions her own conduct following the critical incident. The student claims that her emotional response to the incident (as discussed in Section 5.1 above) resulted in her failure as a professional. As shown in the examples in Table 6 below, the student’s negative evaluation of her own conduct, represented by the Targets of judgement, as ‘failures’, ‘assumption’ and ‘struggles’ are explicitly constructed in the text through repeated instances of inscribed negative judgement.

Similar to the social work CRE, where the student social worker negatively evaluated her behaviour as a professional, the business student also negatively evaluates his own behaviour towards his peers as inappropriate and offensive. This is construed by repeated instances of inscribed negative [ejudgement: propriety] and [ejudgement: capacity], for example, ‘discounting’, ‘selfish’ and ‘misguided’, as shown in Table 7 below.

Fig. 6. Coupling of negative judgement of the students’ own behaviour.

In the Critical Incident, Excavation and Reflection stages of the assignments, the students primarily focus on confessing their lack of understanding of professional conduct and show that their inappropriate behaviour was a result of their inexperience. They both cite this lack of understanding as the cause for negatively evaluating their client’s or team’s behaviour in a particular problematic situation. We can again formalise these patterns as a coupling of the students’ [ejudgement] targeting their own behaviour, as shown in Fig. 6.

A closer examination of these stabilised couplings helps reveal how both students’ developing professional identities unfold over the course of the texts. Both students first negatively judge their clients’ and team mates’ behaviour. As the students acquire better understanding of the problematic situation through excavating into the theoretical models provided for them (e.g. Fook’s model of deconstruction and reconstruction and Solomon and Schell’s model of intercultural competency), they become more ‘aware’ of how professional conduct is valued in their disciplinary areas. Thus they shift from their negative assumptions made about their clients and team members to an increased understanding of their complicit role in the incident, leading to the negative judgement of their own behaviour.

Once the students have established couplings of negative affect and the critical incident as well as couplings of negative judgement of other participants’ and their own behaviour, they are able to proceed to the Transformation stage of the critical reflection assignments. This is the focus of the following section.

# 5.3. Transformation: Recasting inappropriate behaviour for future transformation

The final Transformation stage in reflective assignments represents the point at which high-scoring students demonstrate their capacity for change and transfer: both students shift from sharing emotions and opinions to comitting to transformed future practice, based on their reflection on previous assumptions about professionalism and practice. This demonstrated change in attitude results in what research on critical reflection, reviewed in Section 2 above, refers to as the transformative nature of critical reflection. The linguistic construction of a more complex type of coupling, i.e. ‘re-coupling’, introduced in Section 3 above, affords one potential resource for demonstrating transformation, which will be illustrated below.

Demonstrating transformation of the student’s understanding in the social work CRE is evidence of what Fook (2002) refers to as ‘challenging’ existing discourses and assumptions that students initially approach the task with. The social work student attempts this ‘challenge’ by re-evaluating her original assessment of her client’s ‘inappropriate’ behaviour and attributing it to a lack of power within the rehabilitation program, as in Example 12 below:

[12] Through such an analysis, it is clear [[to see || that my shock [eaffect: surprise] at the ’inappropriateness’ [ejudgement: propriety] of Jared’s request was related to power]].

Table 8 Re-coupling negative judgement as negative emotion.

Fig. 7. Recoupling of the client’s behaviour.

Linguistically this transformation is achieved by re-evaluating previously established couplings. Table 8 shows how the lower-order coupling the inappropriateness of Jared’s request takes on the function of the Trigger and the attitudinal meaning inscribed in my shock functions as the re-coupling item:

By re-evaluating [ejudgement: propriety] as [eaffect: surprise], this recoupling, shown in Fig. 7, functions to reveal the student’s interpretation of the problematic incident both in terms of the affect and judgement resources that are stabilised or established as patterns of evaluative meaning through a series of couplings in the Critical Incident stage.

The recoupling forms the basis of what she argues is her inexperienced and unprofessional understanding of the situation which causes a negative emotional reaction. Creating this recoupling allows the student to challenge her initial asumptions regarding the client’s behaviour during the incident by identifying and labelling “the existence and operation of discourses and that which is hidden, glossed over or assumed” (Fook, 2002, p. 96). It also allows her to relate her emotional reaction to the incident and her judgement of the client to the function of ‘power’ in social work, where social workers have power over their clients.

This shift from reflection to critical reflection also results in a shift of emphasis from judging the client’s behaviour (inappropriateness of Jared’s request) and the student’s own feelings (my shock) to the client’s feelings (Jared’s frustration). Table 9 exemplifies a series of couplings, in which the client takes on the role of the Emoter.

This shift to the client’s feelings (Jared’s frustration) allows the student to reexamine and negatively evaluate her own behaviour in relation to the incident as a professional social worker. Table 10 shows how that the coupling Jared’s frustration and his potential frustration function as the Target and the attitudinal meaning implied in give little mention and do not consider function as the recoupling item.

Recoupling as a linguistic resource allows the student to re-evaluate her attitude towards the client’s emotional state and understand his behaviour and reactions as a result of his ‘powerless’ position within a placement agency for young offenders. This allows the student to engage with the power structures within social work, which she claims, puts her as a social worker in a position of power over the client because the critical incident takes place within an instutitionalised setting. The recouplings illustrated in Table 10 shows that the student negatively judges her innability to account for client’s feelings in relation to the critical incident and the events that follow. In doing so, the student is thus successfully able to demonstrate a shift from a personalized and subjective understanding of an incident she found emotionally difficult to an objective and theorised understanding of how that incident should be viewed from the perspective of professional social work practice.

The business student’s ‘challenge’ to existing practices emerges in the realisation that making assumptions about ‘foreign’ cultural communication and teamwork styles has lead to his misunderstanding of his peers and a tendency to stereotype them. The business student links this negative stereotyping to his ‘hidden’ Australian cultural value of ‘individualism’, selected from Solomon and Schell’s (2009) model of ‘core elements of culture’. In the final Transformation stage therefore he acknowledges a need to develop his intercultural competency skills in order to better manage future multinational teamwork situations, as in Example 13 below:

[13] The development of intercultural competence is the key [[to overcoming my detrimental behaviour in a multinational team situation]].

Table 9 Couplings with the client as Emoter.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Trigger</td><td>Appraised/Target</td><td>Emoter</td><td>Type &amp; valence</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>frustration</td><td> Jared&#x27;s</td><td>[affect: insecurity: disquiet]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>struggle</td><td> Jared&#x27;s</td><td>[affect: insecurity: disquiet]</td></tr><tr><td>regarding having to be part of the program.</td><td>potential frustration</td><td>His</td><td>[-affect: insecurity: disquiet]</td></tr><tr><td>at the agency&#x27;s consideration of more punitive action towards him.</td><td>frustration</td><td> Jared&#x27;s</td><td>[-affect: insecurity: disquiet]</td></tr></table></body></html>

This transformation is demonstrated by re-evaluating previously established couplings: Table 11 shows that the coupling my detrimental behaviour functions as the Target and the attitudinal meaning inscribed in overcoming functions as the recoupling item.

This change in valence, i.e. recoupling the attitudinal value [ejudgement: propriety] as $[ + ,$ judgement: propriety], serves to recast the writer’s negative evaluation inscribed in the lower-order coupling my detrimental behaviour. This is the first step in moving away from inappropriate behaviours towards professional competencies that are valued in the field of business studies (see Fig. 8).

Similar to the social work student, the linguistic resource of recoupling thus enables the business student to re-evaluate his attitude: developing his intercultural competency skills is the ethical thing to do as a business professional. Linking this transformation to a key business concept, intercultural competence, allows the student to demonstrate his capacity for critical reflection in a manner that is valued by his academic discipline. Other similar recouplings where the student re-evaluates his previous behaviour by resources of judgement are shown in Table 12.

In both texts, once the students have established the couplings of negative affect and the incident and negative judgement towards the self and others, they are able to proceed to engaging with the larger theoretical frameworks and with more complex axiological meanings that constitute their disciplinary fields. In the social work CRE, the student’s recouplings focus on her inappropriate behaviour as a professional social worker, who fails to consider the client’s frustrations at being in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. In the business example, the student’s recouplings are misinterpretations of his group member’s behaviours based on a lack of intercultural competency. In terms of academic discourse, both students are required to engage with highly complex discursive relations, which technicalise subjective evaluative meanings by linking personal experiences to theoretical frameworks valued in their disciplines via the process of recoupling. This enables demonstrating evidence of transformation from novice to professional whose behaviour aligns with the valued theoretical positions of their fields of practice.

# 6. Discussion

We began this paper by drawing attention to the growing importance of critical reflection assignments, designed to foster critical thinking in higher education. Our research has been motivated by the need to understand this assessment type specifically in order to inform evidence-based pedagogy that makes visible the disciplinary expectations of the process of critical reflection to English as well as Non-English Speaking Background students. A considerable amount of research focuses on the highly emotive and personal nature of critical reflection, which is particularly challenging for students who are used to objectivity in other assignments in disciplines such as social work and business (Fook et al., 2016). Previous research has claimed that critical reflection tasks are a form of ‘creative play’ that results in assignment types with no specific genre or text structure and are thus unteachable and unassessable (Creme, 2008). Our analysis of social work and business reflective assignments show that students from different disciplines engage in similar knowledge practices when performing tasks that require critical self-reflection. This is despite the fact that the texts draw on different frameworks for discplinary practices (Fook, 2002; Solomon & Schell, 2009) and have varied prompts, which require the students to engage with the critical analysis of incidents or experiences in different ways.

Drawing on the SFL framework of APPRAISAL, our analysis has revealed that critical reflection assignments across different academic disciplines can have a number of commonalities. These rely on the linguistic construction of stabilised couplings and recouplings through which high-scoring students consistently evaluate and re-evaluate their own and other participants’ emotional reactions and behaviours. The resource of recoupling is especially significant for technicalising everyday emotions and judgements in order to engage with complex theoretical meanings, such as ‘power relations’ in social work or ‘intercultural competency’ in business studies.

In terms of pedagogical practices, our study can contribute to the explicit teaching of the highly complex evaluative resources that empower students to produce successful critical reflection assignments. This means demonstrating moves from couplings to recouplings for deconstructing and recasting initial assumptions about emotional reactions and behaviours. In other words, to show capacity for critical reflection, students need to demonstrate that linking subjective experiences to theoretical frameworks have allowed them to change their perceptions of the critical incident and evaluate it with the ‘cultivated gaze’, i.e. “prolonged exposure” (Maton, 2014, p. 95) to professional practice.

Research on critical reflection assignments states that these tasks allow students to ‘transform’ their understandings of discplinarity and practice, ‘challenge’ the status quo and ‘emancipate’ themselves from institutionalised power. However, the literature rarely discusses that the capacity to do so is only accessible to a few students with the right dispositions and education who are capable of tacitly acquiring the ‘rules of the game’. This paper has shown that instead of engaging in ‘creative play’ (Creme, 2008), successful students across disciplines show structured and formulaic use of linguistics resources for evaluation across the unfolding text in order to engage with the personal as well as the objective in their assignments. At the level of genre, this refers to making choices in genre staging that are valued in a particular academic discipline. At the level discourse semantics, this refers to the ability to draw on the resources of coupling and re-coupling. Making these strategies visible to students in pedagogical contexts, we argue, will allow students to move beyond the ‘hopelessly subjective’ and ‘anecdotal’ in their assignments. However, our analyses also revealed that the student writers who were awarded a high grade tend to focus almost exclusively on negative self-judgement and ‘failure’ in an institutional setting. This could be seen as contributing to deficit discourses e an ethical concern associated with assessing reflective assignments that ask students to divulge often deeply personal and ethically sensitive information (see e.g. Boud & Walker, 1998; Ghaye, 2007; Marsh, 2014; Morley, 2007). While including analyses of reflective assignments written by NESB students was beyond the scope of this paper, none of these students participating in this research received a High Distinction or a Distinction for their reflective assignments. This confirms Maton’s point that not all students are able to demonstrate capacity for critical reflection (personal communication) whether they are local ESB or international NESB students. This points not only to the need for further research but also a need to design reflective tasks that enable rather than constrain students’ learning to become self-reflective practitioners. We hope that the results of this study will motivate academics to critically reflect on the requirements of reflective assignments so that students will be able to demonstrate ‘professional growth’ and bring about social change (Fook & Gardner, 2007), making the growing interest in critical reflection as an assessment type for cultivating and assessing critical thinking a justifiable one.
