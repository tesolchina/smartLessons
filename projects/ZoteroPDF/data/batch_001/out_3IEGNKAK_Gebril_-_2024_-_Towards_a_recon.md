This article provides a response to Deborah Crusan’s paper on ungrading and reflects on the existing potentials and challenges associated with using this concept. The article also offers a reconciliatory perspective that attempts to bring together the competing writing assessment paradigms and to take into consideration contextual limitations and opportunities.

In her discussion of ungrading in writing classes, Crusan taps into a number of critical issues related to the tension between accountability requirements and learning-oriented writing assessment practices. This topic has received considerable attention in the language assessment literature as suggested by Crusan who identified over 50 books around the topic of ungrading since 2017. Crusan cited a number of reasons for the importance of ungrading and why there is growing interest in this area. One of the main reasons has to do with concerns over teachers attempting to keep the status quo so that students remain in “a position of docility.” These practices have been well documented in the literature that shows assessment currently used to control both students and schools in different instructional settings (e.g., Brown et al., 2011; Gebril & Brown, 2014). For instance, Brown et al. (2011) collected data through purposive sampling from teachers in both Hong Kong and Guangzhou and their results indicated that accountability-oriented assessment practices are usually seen not only as a sign of school quality, but also as a tool for controlling schools and students in the Chinese context. Similar results were obtained by Gebril and Brown (2014) based on self-reported teacher data collected from the south of Egypt where there was a strong relationship between scores and perceptions about school quality.

Another reason cited by Crusan is associated with the negative effects of grade-oriented practices on learning. This conclusion is in agreement with the language assessment literature on test washback. The washback literature has shown that accountability-oriented practices in language classes can sometimes be harmful since such practices come at the expense of real learning. These practices could also lead to fairness concerns given the variability in resources students have access to Cheng (2008) and Gebril and Eid (2017). Due to these problematic issues, Crusan argues that ungrading could contribute to current efforts to mitigate these harmful consequences by providing a mechanism for empowering students, improving learning, and promoting fairness and equity.

In her attempt to define ungrading, Crusan presents a number of perspectives about this issue and concludes that “ungrading is a pedagogical approach that touts learning over grades.” While there are some voices that call for eliminating grading, Crusan offers a balanced approach that takes into consideration both the summative and formative functions of assessment. This takes me to an issue related to whether ungrading is the best label we could use in this current discussion. In fact, many of the techniques listed by Crusan, such as portfolio assessment, contract grading, specifications grading, and the overarching alternative assessment concept, involve some scoring/grading procedures. I would argue that ungrading is probably not the best label and I would propose ‘learning-oriented feedback’ as an alternative. The concept of learning-oriented feedback is not new and could be traced to the literature on formative assessment, assessment for learning, and more recently learning-oriented assessment. Crusan, in her discussion, has learning as one of the cornerstones for the ungrading concept and that is why this proposed label fits perfectly with the arguments put forth in this response. In general, learning-oriented assessment has three principles as suggested by Carless (2007, pp. 59–60):

Assessment tasks should be designed to stimulate sound learning practices amongst students. Assessment should involve students actively in engaging with criteria, quality, their own and/or peers’ performance. − Feedback should be timely and forward-looking so as to support current and future student learning.

These principles are in alignment with the advantages proposed by Crusan based on her review of the literature. Involving students in the assessment of their performance could develop their agency, lower their affective filter, and contribute to enhancing their motivation. These ideas are closely related to what Crusan calls in her article ‘engagement-based grading’ which could lead to improvement in student learning. One final value of using the label ‘learning-oriented feedback’ has to do with acknowledging the contribution of writing instructors in this process. While ungrading does not attempt to ignore the role of the teacher, there are still some negative connotations associated with the concept. That is why the proposed label could promote the benefits of the ‘timely and forward-looking’ teacher feedback.

While ungrading has a number of merits, it comes with a host of challenges as suggested by Crusan. It goes without saying that alternative techniques are very time-consuming and this issue should be taken into consideration when adopting any of these techniques. In certain contexts (Egypt as an example), this could even become more complicated when teachers work with large classes. In many developing countries, you might have writing classes with over 60 students and this makes the task of teachers more challenging given their increased workload. Other challenges might be related to a combination of institutional policies and various ways of how assessment is perceived by different stakeholders. In examination-based contexts, students might have doubts about the effectiveness of self- or peer assessment, for example, since they rather value teacher feedback more. In other contexts, teachers and students do not have enough training in alternative assessment techniques, and sometimes the process is not straightforward but rather turbulent. That is why both writing instructors and students have to understand what they are getting themselves into when selecting some of these techniques.

Crusan concludes her article with a reconciliatory message through acknowledging the limitations and advantages in this context. She also acknowledges the existing tension between different assessment paradigms. In her conclusion, she offers an optimistic perspective: Writing instructors could successfully make their informed decisions about the assessment techniques suitable for their context. However, there are some pre-conditions that should be there to ensure the successful implementation of these procedures. First, teachers should keep this balance between formative and summative assessment practices. There is also a need for enhancing writing assessment literacy not only for teachers, but also for students and other stakeholders. I truly believe that most of these at tempts to bring together different paradigms of writing assessment would not be successful without having stakeholders who are assessment literate, including students, teachers, parents, school administrators, and educational policy makers. Assessment-literate stakeholders can work together towards a shared goal that aims at improving current practices and can successfully navigate the uncharted territories of writing assessment.
