# ABSTRACT

Previous studies on web-based collaborative writing have shown that task modality impacts peer interaction patterns and attention to form. However, these studies have primarily focused on contrasting a face-to-face oral condition with a text-based synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) environment. Few studies have compared peer interaction patterns and attention to form between text-based SCMC and text-based asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC), the two common modes of computer-mediated communication. This study aimed at filling this research gap. Participants were 22 EFL learners who worked in self-selected pairs to complete two L2 collaborative writing tasks, one through text-based SCMC and the other text-based ACMC, using Google Docs. Patterns of interaction for each pair within each task mode were identified. Attention to form was measured through language-related episodes (LREs). Quality of attention to form was assessed via learners’ LRE engagement levels. The results show that task modality affected the occurrence but it did not affect the focus and outcome of LREs. Task modality, however, impacted peer interaction patterns and quality of attention to form, with more collaborative pair dynamics and elaborate LRE engagement being generated in text-based SCMC tasks.

# Introduction

Interaction plays an essential role in successful second language (L2) learning (Sato & Ballinger, 2016). From the perspective of cognitive theories, interaction creates opportunities for L2 learners to negotiate meaning and form, receive feedback, notice linguistic items, and produce pushed output (Long, 1996). From the sociocultural theory of learning perspective (Vygotsky, 1978), interaction creates opportunities for languaging (Swain, 2006), involving deliberation about language choice and L2 knowledge co-construction. Collaborative writing, which requires learner pairs to co-produce a written text, has been suggested by many to create an optimal condition for peer interaction and provide a social-cognitive L2 learning activity (Donato, 1994; Storch, 1998, 1999, 2013; Swain, 1995).

Collaborative writing provides L2 learners an opportunity to interactively develop their writing skills (Storch, 2005). Through the co-construction of a text, it enhances L2 writing through joint scaffolding and languaging, allowing learners to identify gaps in their own knowledge, hypothesize about language, and discuss these aspects of language (Hanjani & Li, 2014; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2012). With the increasing accessibility and advancement of Web 2.0 technologies, such as wikis and Google Docs, and their ease of use for composing, commenting, and editing, web-based collaborative writing has begun to gain popularity in L2 writing pedagogy and research (Arnold, Ducate, & Kost, 2009; Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Kessler, 2009; Kessler & Bikowski, 2010; Kost, 2011; Lee, 2008, 2010; Mak & Coniam, 2008; Miyazoe & Anderson, 2010). A number of studies have shown that web-based collaborative writing fosters collective scaffolding (Donato, 1994) and facilitates attention to form (i.e. deliberation about form and language choice, and correcting errors) (Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Kessler, 2009; Kost, 2011; Lee, 2010; Oskoz & Elola, 2010), leading to improved writing quality. Studies have also shown that attention to form, which is considered facilitative and central to L2 learning (Schmidt, 2001), vary depending on peer interaction patterns during the collaborative writing process (Li & Kim, 2016; Li & Zhu, 2013, 2017a, 2017b). Research on interaction patterns has thus far identified several variables relevant to peer interaction and attention to form, e.g. task modality (Rouhshad & Storch, 2016).

To date, a small number of studies have compared peer interaction patterns across modalities. Nevertheless, when such comparison studies were conducted, they typically contrasted a FTF (oral) condition with a text-based synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) environment (e.g. Rouhshad & Storch, 2016; Tan, Wigglesworth, & Storch, 2010). Except for Wang (2019), little research on collaborative L2 writing has compared peer interaction patterns between text-based SCMC and text-based asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) environments, the two common interaction modes in computer-mediated communication (CMC) contexts. Additionally, little research on collaborative L2 writing has compared interaction patterns together with learners’ attention to form (i.e. its occurrence, focus, outcome, and quality) between the two text-based CMC modes. Such comparisons are important given that (1) computer-mediated activities have become essential in language classrooms in this technologically driven world (Ortega, 2009), (2) computer-mediated collaborative writing has captured growing attention in L2 learning (Li, 2018), and (3) different task modalities may generate different L2 learning opportunities (i.e. attention to form) (Storch, 2011) and affect interaction differently (Rouhshad & Storch, 2016; Tan et  al., 2010; Wang, 2019). Consequently, it is essential to compare and contrast the impact of the two common text-based CMC modes on peer interaction patterns and attention to form (and its quality). Comparing collaborative writing via text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC could contribute to L2 writing research and pedagogy, and assist L2 instructors who are implementing computer-mediated collaborative L2 writing projects to better design tasks and select text-based CMC modes to foster peer collaboration and attention to form.

The present study thus compared peer interaction patterns and attention to form during L2 collaborative writing tasks between text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC.

# Text-based SCMC and ACMC

Text-based SCMC can be defined as communication occurring in real time via a computer in a written form (Loewen & Wolff, 2016). An example of text-based SCMC is a chatroom where two or more interlocuters type and post messages concurrently. Text-based ACMC, on the other hand, usually takes the form of discussion boards, weblogs, or wikis with messages being posted and responded to with time lag. Text-based SCMC thus differs from text-based ACMC in that there is little time interval between messages, and that interlocutors are present online simultaneously (Loewen & Wolff, 2016).

Studies have found that learners benefit from text-based SCMC by receiving timely peer feedback that helps address their linguistic misconceptions and writing problems, making their writing more meaningful and comprehensible to others (Lee, 2002; Yeh, 2014). Lee (2002), for instance, implemented collaborative writing activities to improve learners’ writing via a synchronous chat program in Blackboard that allowed learners to have synchronous interactions and consultations with others to collaboratively complete writing tasks. She found that interacting via text-based SCMC resulted in collaborative work, as interlocuters had to negotiate form and meaning to help one another achieve mutual comprehension when working concurrently on a writing task. Yeh (2014) also found that text-based SCMC interaction resulted in learners making collaborative efforts to correct grammatically incorrect and revise semantically inaccurate sentences. Text-based SCMC is thus considered a valuable framework to facilitate peer collaboration (Liang, 2010).

Text-based ACMC, on the other hand, has been reported to enable students to give feedback at their own pace. The time lag in text-based ACMC interaction has been found to (1) allow learners to take time to reflect on and craft their contributions to discussions (Lapadat, 2002), (2) allow learners to evaluate their texts for revision, clarify their intended ideas, and offer alternatives (Bradley, 2014), and (3) engage learners in seeking and providing advice, eliciting opinions, and asking questions on both meaning and form in collaborative activities (Saeed & Ghazali, 2017). Text-based ACMC is thus suggested to facilitate deeply thought-out discussions (Chen, 2016).

However, given the time interval between messages, the potential of text-based ACMC context for collaborative learning has been claimed to be more complex as it prevents learners from receiving immediate feedback and reduces the opportunities for providing adjusted assistance (Kitade, 2008). This could lead to a potentially lower response rate compared to text-based SCMC exchanges (Kitade, 2006). Kitade (2006), for instance, engaged 24 learner dyads in text-based ACMC interaction (via email) to complete a jigsaw task. She found that half of the requests made by the participants for solving linguistic problems were disregarded by their partners. Kitade explained the findings, suggesting that the time lag in text-based ACMC exchanges may lessen the pressure on participants to respond to negotiation signals, allowing them to easily forget or ignore the requests, thus resulting in a low rate of response.

In sum, the two text-based CMC modes afford different interaction characteristics. The differing affordances of computer-mediated environments could have a direct impact on the process of collaboration (Elola & Oskoz, 2017). Arguably, it is possible that interaction patterns (or pair dynamics) and attention to form may be impacted when collaborative writing is conducted in the two text-based CMC modes.

# Patterns of interaction in L2 collaborative writing

In her seminal work on the nature of peer interaction in the FTF collaborative writing task environment, Storch (2002, 2013) revealed that learners form distinct types of relationship and engage in different interaction patterns. Four patterns of interaction (i.e. collaborative, dominant/dominant, dominant/passive, and expert/novice) were identified based on the degree of equality (level of contribution and degree of control over the writing task) and mutuality (degree of engagement with each other’s contributions). Storch (2002) found that interaction patterns affected the quantity and quality of learners’ attention to language during collaboration and, ultimately, language learning outcomes. She reported that learner pairs exhibiting collaborative pair dynamics, i.e. collaborative (moderate to high mutuality and equality) or expert/novice (moderate to low equality but moderate to high mutuality) patterns, were more likely to offer each other, and be receptive to, assistance (e.g. providing corrections and explanations of grammatical conventions, word meaning, or word choice). Consequently, they produced better texts and showed evidence of more learning. However, in the dominant/passive pattern (moderate to low equality and mutuality) or dominant/dominant pattern (moderate to high equality but moderate to low mutuality), there were fewer learning opportunities. Storch suggested that collaborative pairs demonstrating moderate to high levels of mutuality were more prone to focus on and deliberate about language choice, to pool their different linguistic resources to resolve language problems, and to retain the co-constructed linguistic knowledge.

As in the FTF collaborative writing context, studies on web-based collaborative writing have reported that L2 learners demonstrated different interaction patterns. Li and Zhu (2013), for instance, analyzed wiki discussions from nine L2 groups and examined equality and mutuality (Storch, 2002), by reviewing and comparing group members’ language function instances (i.e. language mediating functions such as stating, agreeing, suggesting, elaborating, and eliciting) and each member’s contribution to group writing regarding word counts. They derived three interaction patterns: collectively contributing/mutually supportive (high equality and high mutuality), authoritative/responsive (low equality and high mutuality), and dominant/withdrawn (low equality and low mutuality).

In another study, Li and Zhu (2017b) conducted a wiki-based collaborative writing project in an English for Academic Purposes course. This time they drew upon a more systematic coding framework to analyze four small groups’ wiki interactions. Li and Zhu evaluated equality by examining the groups’ wiki discussions, comments, and history archives for types and frequency counts of language functions and writing change functions (i.e. text co-construction functions such as adding, deleting, reorganizing, rephrasing, and correcting). They evaluated mutuality by analyzing each group’s language functions for instances of initiating (i.e. proposing new ideas) and responding (i.e. reacting to others’ ideas) as well as self- versus other-writing change functions (i.e. changes to one’s own/others’ texts), and by examining scaffolding strategies (i.e. peer assistance such as affective involvement, contingent responsivity, direction maintenance, instructing, and intersubjectivity). Four distinct interaction patterns were derived: collective (high equality and mutuality), expert/novice (moderate to low equality but high mutuality), dominant/defensive (low equality and mutuality), and cooperating-in-parallel (high equality but low mutuality). As in the FTF context, it is reported that pairs who demonstrated collaborative pair/group dynamics (i.e. high mutuality as in collective and expert/novice pattern) in the web-based environment produced the highest quality writing (Li & Zhu, 2017b) and most learning opportunities (Li & Zhu, 2013).

Although the positive effect of collaborative pair dynamics has been confirmed, research (e.g. Kim & McDonough, 2008; Storch & Aldosari, 2013) has also revealed that learner pairs do not always work collaboratively. The extent of collaboration could in turn affect learners’ engagement levels with language form (Storch & Aldosari, 2013) and ultimately language learning (Moranski & Toth, 2016). Storch (2008) used the word engagement to describe the quality of learners’ attention to language form. According to Storch, different levels of engagement entail different levels of attention to form, which in turn impact L2 learning differently. She operationalized learners’ attention to form as language-related episodes (LREs), defined as any part of a dialogue where learners talk about language produced, question their language use, or provide self- or other corrections (Swain & Lapkin, 2001). Storch further distinguished LRE engagement level between elaborate (learners deliberating on the language items, seeking and providing explanations and alternatives) and limited LREs (learners simply stating the linguistic item without further deliberation), and examined the impact of learners’ level of LRE engagement during collaborative work. Storch reported that it was the elaborate engagement LREs that was beneficial for L2 consolidation/learning. Research has thus started to identify variables that may affect peer interaction and attention to form in collaborative L2 writing, including task modality (Rouhshad & Storch, 2016).

# Patterns of interaction and attention to form in L2 collaborative writing: comparison studies on task modality

A small number of L2 collaborative writing studies have begun to investigate learners’ interactions across different communication modes. Tan et  al. (2010), for instance, asked beginner learners of Chinese to complete a range of collaborative writing tasks in FTF then text-based SCMC mode. They reported a similar number of pairs working in a collaborative pattern for FTF and text-based SCMC. However, they identified an additional cooperative pattern1 where both participants worked on the task but did not engage with each other’s contributions (division of labour; moderate to high equality but low mutuality); this pattern was found only in text-based SCMC.

In another study, Rouhshad and Storch (2016) had L2 learners complete two similar collaborative writing tasks, one FTF and the other text-based SCMC, using Google Docs. They found that L2 learners collaborated more in FTF and cooperated more in text-based SCMC. They also investigated the quantity and quality of learners’ attention to form (i.e. LREs) during peer interaction. LREs were examined to identify which linguistic forms were attended to, whether learners sought or provided explanations for their linguistic choices (i.e. engagement level), and whether linguistic problems were successfully resolved (i.e. outcome). The results showed that (1) FTF generated more LREs, (2) interaction modes did not influence linguistic focus or resolution of LREs, and (3) in FTF, the majority of LREs showed elaborate engagement while in text-based SCMC there were more limited engagement LREs.

In another study, García Mayo and Azkarai (2016) had their learners perform four collaborative tasks (two written and two oral), and analyzed them for LREs. Their results indicated a significant impact of task modality on the occurrence, focus, and outcome of LREs: learners not only generated more LREs in the written modality, but more of these were form-focused and resolved. They reported, however, a minor impact of task modality on learners’ LRE engagement levels: though more limited-engagement LREs were found in the written mode, learners’ engagement was mostly elaborate and very similar in both task modalities.

In sum, these studies suggest that (1) task modality affects interaction patterns (i.e. the occurrence of collaborative pair dynamics) and attention to form, and (2) the written mode is more conducive to L2 collaborative learning than the FTF (oral) mode, and (3) the FTF mode is more beneficial than the text-based SCMC mode. It appears that text-based SCMC did not create a very optimal context for collaborative writing activities. However, in the two studies (i.e. García Mayo & Azkarai, 2016; Rouhshad & Storch, 2016) that compared L2 collaborative writing across modalities, more than one variable (i.e. modality) was involved. In García Mayo and Azkarai’s (2016) and Rouhshad and Storch’s (2016) studies, only one member of the pair was allowed to write text.2 In addition, in García Mayo and Azkarai’s (2016) study, opinions were exchanged orally while in Rouhshad and Storch’s (2016) study they were exchanged via text-chat. Therefore, the impact of text-based SCMC on peer interaction patterns during collaborative writing remains unknown, particularly on fostering collaborative pair dynamics and attention to form, if both members can write the text and engage in text-based idea communication, and when it is compared to its text-based asynchronous counterpart, the ACMC mode.

To address this research gap, Wang (2019) conducted a qualitative case study examining peer interactions of two small groups of English as Second Language learners (each with 3 students) when they performed two collaborative writing tasks in text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC contexts. Patterns of interaction were identified regarding equality and mutuality (Storch, 2002) by analyzing language functions and writing change functions (Li & Zhu, 2017a) during collaborative writing processes. She found that task modality affects interaction. One of her two groups showed collaborative group dynamics in both text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC (reflected in high equality and mutuality), whereas the other group demonstrated collaborative dynamics in text-based ACMC but non-collaborative dynamics (an expert/passive pattern reflected in low equality and mutuality) in text-based SCMC.

Though Wang’s (2019) study has provided some evidence for the task modality effect in web-based collaborative L2 writing, her study involved only two small groups and she did not examine learners’ attention to form, a prerequisite to L2 learning (Schmidt, 2001), during collaborative writing processes in the two text-based CMC modes. More studies are needed to allow a decisive conclusion to be drawn.

# The present study3

This study thus investigates the effect of task modality on the occurrence of collaborative pair dynamics and attention to form (operationalized as LREs) in web-based L2 collaborative writing, focusing specifically on text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC. In the current study, both pair members engaged in text-based idea communication and were allowed to write text in both the text-based CMC modes. Three research questions (RQs) are posed.

1. Does task modality affect the occurrence of collaborative pair dynamics during web-based L2 collaborative writing?   
2. Does task modality affect the occurrence, focus, and outcome of LREs during web-based L2 collaborative writing?   
3. Does task modality affect learners’ LRE engagement levels (i.e. quality of attention to form)?

# Methodology

# Participants

Participants $\left( N = 2 2 \right)$ were English as a foreign language (EFL) learners (aged 20 to 21) from one intact junior English writing class in an applied linguistics department at a Taiwanese university. The participants were, in general, at level B2 according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Prior to the study, the participants had taken four semesters of required writing instruction. The participants had already learned basic academic writing skills such as producing grammatically correct sentences and organizing sentences into paragraphs and paragraphs into academic essays. The participants had also learned how to conduct peer reviews4 and respond to peer feedback for revising and editing. The participants did not have any collaborative writing experience prior to the study, but they had had experience working collaboratively on joint assignments in another course. Following the writing course curriculum, at the time of data collection, the participants were learning and practicing writing expository essays. The writing class met weekly for two hours and was the only writing class the participants were taking at the time of data collection.

# Writing tasks

Two writing tasks (Appendix A), designed in parallel form, were used in this study. The order of administration of the two tasks was counterbalanced (see Table 1). The topics were chosen for their relevance to the participants’ immediate environment (distance learning and job hunting) and their appropriateness was verified by three experts in the researcher’s department. The two writing tasks required four-paragraph (approximately 500 words) expository academic essays.

# Procedure

At the beginning of the study, the instructor/researcher created separate Google Docs pages for student pairs. To familiarize them with Google Docs writing, the instructor demonstrated its features in class, including how to write, edit, and give/respond to comments as well as how to exchange ideas and feedback via text-chat. The instructor/researcher also designed a trial Google Docs page to provide students with further practice. Subsequently, students self-selected partners (11 pairs were formed) to write with on their Google Docs pages. Each pair collaboratively completed the two essay writing tasks (with the same partner) out-of-class, one via text-based SCMC and the other via text-based

ACMC. The two task modes were counterbalanced; that is, half of the pairs (Group A and B, 6 pairs in total) wrote via text-based SCMC mode first, followed by the text-based ACMC mode. The other half (Group C and D, 5 pairs in total) wrote the other way around (see Table 1).5

Since the research purpose was to investigate modality effects on the students’ interaction, the instructor did not intervene in the collaborations: students were told to complete the two essays collaboratively but decided independently how to approach them (though they were required to make their contributions, i.e. written texts and comments/feedback, on their Google Docs pages). They were explicitly told not to complete their writing elsewhere and copy and paste their contributions onto Google Docs. Students were given guidelines (Appendix B), instructing them on how to write on their Google Docs pages synchronously and asynchronously with their partners. The students had one week to complete each writing task and each group submitted their jointly written essay to be graded ( $1 0 \%$ of the course grade for each essay). The students received points from the collaborative processes and the written products (see Appendix C for rubrics) with general teacher feedback.6 The learners completed an exit questionnaire at the end of the study.

# L2 collaborative writing via text-based SCMC

Since writing in text-based SCMC mode required the two learners to be online simultaneously, they were asked to negotiate and decide on a day and time within a designated week, and inform the researcher/ instructor of their selection. To facilitate and ensure text-based synchronous collaboration, in addition to having the learners write, edit, and comment (and respond to comments) synchronously, learners were encouraged to use the text-chat function, a synchronous feature of Google Docs, to exchange ideas and feedback. However, as Google Docs does not save text-chat transcripts automatically, learners were asked to copy them into Microsoft Word and submit them along with their collaborative essays. Furthermore, to ensure the validity of implementation, a research assistant monitored the synchronous collaborative writing process; the time stamp on Google Docs history pages and on comments were also checked. All the pairs conducted the writing task synchronously.

# L2 collaborative writing via text-based ACMC

Unlike text-based SCMC, when the learners wrote via text-based ACMC, they could exchange opinions, write, edit, and give and respond to comments at any time they wanted within the designated week. Since, as indicated above, Google Docs text-chat scripts were not saved automatically, learners were told only to use the comment function.7 Similarly, the research assistant monitored the asynchronous collaborative writing process;8 the time stamp on Google Docs history pages and on comments were checked to ensure the validity of implementation. All the pairs conducted this writing task asynchronously.

Figures 1 and 2 display examples of text-based SCMC and ACMC collaborative writing in this study. In text-based SCMC, writing usually unfolds with two learners exchanging content ideas, composing, and checking language forms concurrently. In text-based ACMC, writing normally begins with two learners proceeding individually with their content ideas, composing, leaving the page, and returning to compose and/or exchange feedback during the time lag in between.

# Data coding

# Interaction patterns

Storch’s (2002) framework, distinguishing interaction patterns based on degrees of equality and mutuality, was used to guide pattern identification. Since collaborative pair dynamics are characterized by a moderate to high degree of mutuality, we adopted Li and Kim (2016) and Li and Zhu’s (2013, 2017a, 2017b) coding framework to identify degrees of mutuality (Appendix D). Mutuality was examined by (1) scrutinizing Google Docs comments and chat scripts for instances of language functions (i.e. language mediating functions), and then categorizing them as initiating or responding, (2) scrutinizing Google Docs comments, chat scripts, and history archives for instances of writing change functions (i.e. text co-construction functions) and categorizing them as self or other (i.e. changes to one’s own/partner’s text), and (3) scrutinizing Google Docs comments and chat scripts for instances of scaffolding strategies (i.e. peer assistance). Frequent instances of engaging with each other’s ideas via responding language functions, other writing change functions, and use of scaffolding strategies9 indicated high mutuality. Pairs demonstrating such pair dynamics were coded ‘collaborative’; others were coded ‘non-collaborative’10.

Following the outlined coding framework, the researcher and an outside researcher coded $2 5 \%$ of the data. Cohen’s kappa (k) was run to determine if there was agreement between the researcher’s and the outside researcher’s coding. Cohen’s $\mathrm { k \Omega }$ was $\mathrm { k } \mathrm { = } \ . 7 2$ for language functions, $\mathrm { k } { = } . 7 1$ for writing change functions, and $\mathrm { k } { = } . 8 4$ for scaffolding strategies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The researcher then coded the entire data and derived interaction patterns. The outside researcher helped verify the patterns. Cohen’s $\mathrm { k \Omega }$ was $\mathrm { k } \mathrm { = } \ . 7 2$ for interaction patterns and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Tables  2 and 3 display the number of language and writing change functions, use of scaffolding strategies, and derived interaction patterns in text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC. The following three examples illustrate collaborative (Example 1) and non-collaborative (Examples 2 and 3) interaction patterns.

In Example 1, both learners (Tiffany and $\mathrm { Y i n g ^ { 1 1 } }$ ; text-based SCMC) contributed jointly to the construction of the text. Their interaction contains segments in which both students provided feedback on the other’s ideas. They elicited and suggested ideas and responded via text-chat, working and frequently engaging with each other’s ideas. Tiffany contributed 41 language functions (34 were responding). Ying, on the other hand, contributed 30 language functions (19 were responding). In terms of writing change functions, Tiffany generated 45 (15 were other) and Ying generated 67 (25 were other). Scaffolding was also observed in their interaction. In turn 6, Ying indicated her difficulty with the definition of a challenge in job hunting. Tiffany instructed her on the meaning (a scaffolding strategy), offering a possible direction (turn 7). Ying then acknowledged the help (turn 8). These pair dynamics were coded as ‘collaborative’.

In contrast, Example 2 illustrates a non-collaborative interaction pattern in which students did not collaborate to accomplish the task. The same two students as in Example 1 gave each other corrective feedback via comments, but this was not responded to and mistakes remained in the joint text. When working on this text-based ACMC task, Tiffany and Ying contributed 7 and 15 language functions, respectively; however, none were responding. Tiffany produced 21 writing change functions (only 2 were other); Ying produced 39 (only 1 was other). Thus, the salient characteristics of the pair dynamics here were failure to engage with each other’s suggestions or ideas and inability or unwillingness to react to feedback. Example 3 also illustrates a non-collaborative interaction pattern. Unlike the learners in Example  2, the two learners (Penny and Christine; text-based ACMC) initiated and responded to each other’s ideas via comments. Penny contributed 11 language functions (5 were responding), and Christine contributed 16 language functions (5 were responding). However, the responding language functions were not performed to engage and build upon each other’s ideas for the completion of the task. They were mainly performed to combine individually composed texts into a whole or to simply accept revisions on their texts. Although Penny and Christine generated 34 other writing change functions, with Penny performing 1 and Christine 33, the behavior they demonstrated in this task was peer editing (with Christine dominating the process) rather than collaboration (Storch, 2013). These pair dynamics were thus coded ‘non-collaborative’.

# Attention to form

To better measure learners’ attention to form during collaboration, their interactions were classified as those focusing on form (i.e. LREs, defined as any part of a dialogue where the learners talk about or question the language produced or provide self- or other-corrections (Swain & Lapkin, 1998)) and those on meaning (i.e. meaning-related episodes [MREs], defined as any part of a dialogue where learners talk about or question the content messages, see Example 1).12

Then, following Storch (2008), LREs’ focus was categorized according to what the learners attended to, whether grammatical form (F-LRE), dealing with syntax and morphology; lexis (L-LRE), dealing with word meaning, spelling, and choice; or mechanics (M-LRE), dealing with punctuation. The outcome of LREs was analyzed as ‘resolved’ or ‘unresolved’. Following García Mayo and Azkarai (2016), two types of ‘resolved’ LREs, namely ‘target-like’ and ‘non target-like’, and two types of ‘unresolved’ LREs, namely ‘addressed’ and ‘ignored’, were further distinguished. Following the outlined coding framework, twenty-five percent of the data were coded by the researcher and the outside researcher for instance of LREs and MREs. Cohen’s $\mathrm { k \Omega }$ was $\mathrm { k } = \ . 8 3$ . The researcher and the outside researcher then coded the same portion of the data for focus and outcome of LREs. Cohen’s $\mathrm { k \Omega }$ was $\mathrm { k } = \ . 8 4$ for focus and $\mathrm { k = ~ } . 8 0$ for outcomes. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The researcher then coded the entire data.

# Level of engagement

To measure the quality of learners’ attention to form, LREs were analyzed for the level of learner engagement. García Mayo and Azkarai’s (2016) and Storch’s (2008) frameworks were adopted and modified to fit the current study’s purpose. Engagement levels in this study were categorized as high-degree elaborate LREs (i.e. both partners engaged in addressing and solving a raised linguistic issue), low-degree elaborate LREs (i.e. one partner raised a linguistic issue and offered a solution; the partner accepted it and revised the text accordingly), low-degree limited LREs (i.e. only the partner who initiated the LRE was engaged in the issue, which was solved by the initiator), and high-degree limited LREs (i.e. neither partner deliberated or discussed the issue at hand, which remained unsolved). Twenty-five percent of the data were coded by the researcher and the outside researcher. Cohen’s k was $\mathrm { k = ~ } . 8 7$ . Disagreement was resolved through discussion. The researcher then coded the entire data.

Example 4 is of a resolved target-like high-degree elaborate F-LRE. It comes from pair 7 (Ting and Sunny; text-based SCMC), and was initiated by Ting via the Google Docs comment function. Here Ting highlighted the phrase ‘each other’ and suggested that ‘others’ should be used instead to mark plurality. Sunny noticed that Ting’s suggestion was not target-like. She looked it up in an online dictionary and explained her finding to Ting, who accepted it. As Sunny’s answer was correct, this LRE was coded as a resolved target-like LRE. Since the two learners engaged in solving the problem, it was coded as a high-degree elaborate LRE.

Example 4. R esolved target-like high-degree elaborate F-LRE (pair 7, text-based SCMC)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Ting: Sunny:</td><td>If there are more than 3 people, should it be &#x27;others&#x27;? base on Yahoo dictionary each other means </td></tr><tr><td>Ting:</td><td>so I think it don&#x27;t need &#x27;s&#x27;. OK</td></tr></table></body></html>

Example 5. R esolved non-target-like high-degree elaborate L-LRE (pair 1, text-based ACMC)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Samuel: Leo: Samuel: Leo:</td><td>exact? don&#x27;t know what u mean it means to do the exact same thing as what i previously mentioned above i am wonder &#x27;exact&#x27; could be a noun.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Christine: much Penny: (Marked as resolved as delivered by Google Docs)

Tina: Maybe can use they. And the following needs to be changed like ‘their’ health and ‘they’ can. Tina: Or use people.   
Mimi: (Did not respond.)

Example 5 comes from pair 1 (Samuel and Leo; text-based ACMC) and illustrates a resolved non-target-like high-degree elaborate L-LRE. Samuel highlighted the word ‘exact’ in Leo’s sentence, ‘Furthermore, unlike traditional classroom sets with a teacher to make sure that every student is paying attention, it is hard to do the exact with distance course learning’, and questioned its meaning with a comment. Leo explained the meaning to Samuel and assured its part of speech (i.e. ‘exact’ is a noun), which Samuel accepted. Here the linguistic issue was resolved but the answer was incorrect; hence, it was coded as resolved but non-target-like. Since both learners actively engaged in the LRE to resolve the linguistic problem, it was coded as a high-degree elaborate LRE.

Example 6 comes from pair 9 (Christine and Penny; text-based SCMC) and illustrates a resolved target-like low-degree elaborate F-LRE. Christine noticed that Penny made a grammatical mistake in her use of the quantifier ‘many’ with an uncountable noun ‘information’ in the sentence, ‘They usually want to put all the good things or all their achievements into the resume; however, providing too many information is not a good thing’. She highlighted ‘many’ and provided a correction through a comment. Penny noticed this, corrected the mistake, and marked it as resolved in the comment window. Since Christine’s answer was correct and the mistake was repaired, this LRE was coded as a resolved target-like LRE. However, unlike Examples 4 and 5, no discussion or deliberation was initiated. One learner noted a linguistic problem, offered a solution, and the other learner accepted it and edited accordingly. This LRE was thus coded as a low-degree elaborate LRE.

Example 7 illustrates a resolved target-like low-degree limited L-LRE that comes from pair 3 (Tina and Mimi; text-based ACMC). Here Tina highlighted the word ‘you’ in the sentence ‘you have to sacrifice’ and suggested, via the comment function, that the pronoun ‘you’ be replaced by either ‘they’ or ‘people’. Her partner, Mimi, did not respond or edit the text. The sentence was then edited by Tina. Tina’s answer was correct and the linguistic issue was resolved, but as Tina was both initiator and solver of the LRE issue, it was coded as a resolved target-like low-degree limited LRE.

Example 8 comes from pair 9 (Christine and Penny; text-based SCMC), illustrating an unresolved addressed high-degree elaborate

Example 8. U nresolved addressed high-degree elaborate L-LRE (pair 9, text-based SCMC)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>1</td><td>Penny:</td><td>it seems we are done ~. you can check the first sentence and second see whether is weird of not</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Christine:</td><td>or not* &#x27;In addition&#x27; sounds weird at here.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Penny:</td><td>I found a word call &#x27;withal&#x27; how about this.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Christine:</td><td>i don&#x27;t know this word Haha</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Penny:</td><td>idk either and i even don&#x27;t know how to use lol how about separate into two sentences we might change the third sentence and the forth</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Christine:</td><td>fourth* i see i think we are done. good</td></tr></table></body></html>

Example 9. U nresolved ignored high-degree limited L-LRE (pair 8, text-based ACMC).   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Tiffany:e Ying:</td><td>maybe it can use provide? (Did not respond.)</td></tr></table></body></html>

L-LRE. Christine indicated via text-chat that the transition word ‘in addition’ did not sound right (turn 2). Penny then suggested that they use the word ‘withal’ that she found (turn 3). However, neither learners knew how to use the word and decided to change the sentence to omit the transition word. This LRE was thus coded as unresolved but addressed. As both learners deliberated and tried to find a solution, it was coded as a high-degree elaborate LRE.

Example 9 shows an unresolved ignored high-degree limited L-LRE. It comes from pair 8 (Tiffany and Ying; text-based ACMC). Here, Tiffany highlighted the word ‘give’ in the sentence, ‘Therefore, lots of universities started to give distance learning courses’, suggesting through a comment that ‘provide’ be used instead. Her partner did not respond. Tiffany went on with the task without fixing the problem; the sentence remained unchanged. This LRE was thus coded as ignored. As the linguistic issue was left unresolved and neither learner engaged with it, it was coded as high-degree limited LRE.

# Results

RQ1 asks whether task modality (text-based SCMC/ACMC) affects collaborative pair dynamics during web-based collaborative L2 writing. As shown in Table 4, the learners had more collaborative interactions $( 8 2 \%$ ; 9 of 11 pairs) when they co-constructed essays in text-based SCMC than text-based ACMC $( 2 7 \% ; 3$ of 11 pairs). The McNemar test indicated this difference is significant $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 3 1 )$ . In sum, task modality affected peer interaction during web-based L2 collaborative writing, with text-based SCMC generating more collaborative pair dynamics.

RQ2 asks whether task modality impacted the occurrence, focus, and outcome of LREs.

As revealed in Table 5, the 11 learner pairs generated a total of 202 interactions about form and meaning during the text-based SCMC collaborative writing processes, out of which 108 were LREs $\left( M = 9 . 8 2 \right.$ , $S D = 9 . 6 0 { \mathrm { ' } }$ ) and 94 were MREs $\cdot M { = } 8 . 5 5$ , $S D { = } 6 . 0 2 $ ). In text-based ACMC, a total of 180 interactions about form and meaning were produced, out of which 151 were LREs $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 1 3 . 7 3$ , $S D = 1 3 . 3 9 _ { . }$ and 29 were MREs ( $M = 2 . 6 4$ , $S D = 2 . 8 7 $ ). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was no significant difference in the number of LREs and MREs in text-based SCMC $\scriptstyle ( z = - 0 . 2 2 3$ , $ { p }  { = } 0 . 8 2 4$ , $r { = } 0 . 0 7 $ .13 However, in text-based ACMC, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significantly more LREs than MREs $( z = - 2 . 6 1 6$ , $ { p } = 0 . 0 0 9$ , $r = 0 . 7 9 ,$ ). Table 6 shows the normalized number of LREs and MREs in each mode. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed significantly more LREs in text-based ACMC than text-based SCMC $\left( z = - 2 . 0 4 0 \right.$ , $ { p }  { = } 0 . 0 4 1$ , $r = 0 . 6 2 )$ . To sum up, task modality impacted the occurrence of LREs in a web-based context. In text-based SCMC, learners attended to form and meaning to a similar extent, but they attended to form more than meaning in text-based ACMC.

Regarding LRE focus (Table 7), the Friedman tests revealed a significant difference in the number of F-LREs, L-LREs, and M-LREs in both text-based SCMC $( \chi ^ { 2 } [ 2 ] = 1 0 . 5 6 3 $ , $\begin{array} { r }  p = 0 . 0 0 5 \ \end{array}$ ) and text-based ACMC $( \chi ^ { 2 } [ 2 ] = 1 3 . 6 3 2$ , $\begin{array} { r }  p = 0 . 0 0 1 \ \end{array}$ ) contexts. Subsequently, post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted.14 Results revealed no significant difference in the number of F-LREs and L-LREs $\left( z = - 0 . 4 9 9 \right.$ , $ { p } = 0 . 6 1 8$ , $r = 0 . 1 5 )$ in text-based SCMC. However, there were significant differences in the number of F-LREs and M-LREs $\stackrel { \prime } { z } = - 2 . 3 7 1$ , $ { p }  { = } 0 . 0 1 8$ , $r { = } 0 . 7 1 \dot$ ), and L-LREs and M-LREs $( z = - 2 . 5 6 3$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 1 1$ , $r = 0 . 7 7 ,$ . Similarly, in the text-based ACMC context, no significant difference was found in the number of F-LREs and L-LREs $\stackrel { \prime } { z } = - 1 . 3 8 1$ , $\scriptstyle P = 0 . 1 6 7$ , $r = 0 . 4 2 )$ ). There were significant differences in the number of F-LREs and M-LREs $( z = - 2 . 6 7 7$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 0 7$ , $r = 0 . 8 1 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and L-LREs and M-LREs $( z = - 2 . 6 7 5$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 0 7$ , $r { = } 0 . 8 1 $ ). In sum, task modality did not affect the focus of LREs. Learners were equally likely to attend to issues involving grammatical forms and lexis in both text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC, and they paid more attention to grammatical forms and lexis than to mechanics regardless of task modality.

Note. The percentages were calculated considering the number of LRE s initiated in each condition (resolved [target-like/non target like] or unresolved [addressed/ignored]) to the total number of LRE s initiated in each mode.

Regarding the resolution of LREs (Table 8), the Friedman tests revealed a significant difference in the number of target-like resolved, non-targetlike resolved, addressed but unresolved, and ignored LREs $( \chi ^ { 2 } [ 3 ] = 1 8 . 4 0 5$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 0 \rangle } \end{array}$ ) in text-based SCMC. Post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed that more LREs were resolved in a target-like than non-targetlike manner $\stackrel { \prime } { z } = - 2 . 6 7 5$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 0 7$ , $r = 0 . 8 1 \AA$ ). There were also significantly more target-like resolved LREs than addressed but unresolved LREs $\left( z = - 2 . 6 6 8 \right.$ , $ { p } = 0 . 0 0 8$ , $r = 0 . 8 0 \AA$ ). In text-based ACMC, a similar pattern was observed. There was again a significant difference in the number of target-like resolved, non-target-like resolved, addressed but unresolved, and ignored LREs $( \chi ^ { 2 } [ 3 ] = 1 5 . 5 9 3$ , $\begin{array} { r }  p = 0 . 0 0 1 \ \end{array}$ ). Post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed that more LREs were resolved in a target-like than non-target-like manner $\left( z = - 2 . 6 6 8 \right.$ , $ { p }  { = } 0 . 0 0 8$ , $r = 0 . 8 0 \AA$ ), and there were significantly more target-like resolved LREs than addressed but unresolved LREs $\stackrel { \prime } { z } = - 2 . 6 6 8$ , $ { p } = 0 . 0 0 8$ , $r = 0 . 8 0 \AA$ ). In sum, task modality did not influence LRE resolution, and learners resolved more LREs in a target-like manner regardless of task modality.

RQ3 asked whether task modality affected LRE engagement levels. To answer this question, first, the number of high-degree elaborate, low-degree elaborate, low-degree limited, and high-degree limited LREs were tallied. As shown in Table 9, there were more high-degree elaborate LREs $( 4 2 \% )$ in text-based SCMC, and more low-degree elaborate LREs $( 4 9 \% )$ in text-based ACMC. There were more low-degree and high-degree limited LREs in text-based ACMC ( $12 \%$ and $1 8 \%$ , respectively) than text-based SCMC $5 \%$ and $1 5 \%$ , respectively). To facilitate analysis, the data were then realigned to collapse the categories of high- and low-degree elaborate together into the category of ‘elaborate’ and low- and high-degree limited into the category of ‘limited’ (Table 10) and compared. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant difference in the number of elaborate and limited LREs in text-based SCMC $( z = - 1 . 9 6 2$ , $ { p } = 0 . 0 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 5 9 ,$ ), with more elaborate LREs being generated. In text-based ACMC, however, no significant difference was found $\stackrel { \prime } { z } = - 1 . 2 2 6$ , $p = 0 . 2 2 0$ , $r = 0 . 3 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). In sum, task modality affected LRE engagement level in text-based SCMC, with learners engaging more with each other’s contributions.

# Discussion

This study aimed to investigate the impact of task modality (text-based SCMC/ACMC) on peer interaction patterns and attention to form during web-based L2 collaborative writing. The findings suggest that task mode affects peer interaction patterns, which conforms to Wang (2019). In text-based ACMC, collaboration was rare $( 2 7 \% ; 3$ of 11 pairs) whereas in text-based SCMC, pairs had more collaborative interactions ( $8 2 \%$ ; 9 of 11 pairs). When collaborating in text-based SCMC, learners were more likely to co-construct texts, build upon each other’s contributions and suggestions, and provide mutual feedback and assistance. This runs counter to Rouhshad and Storch (2016), who reported fewer instances of collaborative pair dynamics $( 8 \% ; 1$ of 12 pairs) in text-based SCMC. This could be because in the present study both learner pairs could write, edit, and comment simultaneously while in Rouhshad and Storch’s study only one partner could write. Being able to write, edit, and comment simultaneously may have given learners a greater sense of co-authorship, making them feel they both owned the text and were mutually responsible for its completion. The sense of co-authorship in turn could have encouraged learners to exchange feedback, notice linguistic problems, and contribute to decision-making during collaboration (Storch, 2002, 2005), leading to more collaborative pair dynamics.

Additionally, as suggested by Elola and Oskoz (2017), digital tools can directly influence peer collaboration. The synchronous nature of the writing in this study required both writers to be online simultaneously. This aspect of text-based SCMC might have prompted learners to exchange ideas, co-construct, and respond to feedback instantly and reciprocally since collaboration unfolded in real time, thus demanding real-time responses (see also Lee, 2002; Wang, 2019; Yeh, 2014) and leaving little room for passivity, withdrawal, or unresponsiveness. Contrastingly, collaborative writing through text-based ACMC mode did not require partners to be online simultaneously to compose, and real-time responses were unnecessary. This asynchronous affordance may have led to feedback being overlooked during collaboration (Hsu, 2019; Kitade, 2006), making it possible for learners to be absent or withdrawn (Cho, 2017; Li & Zhu, 2013), thus resulting in more non-collaborative pair dynamics.

In terms of attention to form, the current study found a significant difference in the occurrence of LREs in text-based SCMC and ACMC collaborative L2 writing. Learners attended to form and meaning to a similar extent in text-based SCMC, but they attended to form more frequently in text-based ACMC. This may be because when learners developed the text co-dependently and in synchronization with each other’s ideas, they needed to develop the content simultaneously, and therefore needed to understand what was being done or suggested (see Figure 1 for an example). This may have prompted them to negotiate more with each other on content messages in addition to checking language for accuracy, resulting in a more balanced attention to form and meaning. When collaborating asynchronously, in contrast, content ideas were not developed by learners concurrently. A scrutiny of the 11 learner pairs’ Google Docs history archives revealed that it was common for the second writer of a pair to begin with some already developed content messages on the page (see Figure 2 for an example) and for the returning first (or second) writer to meet the same conditions. It is likely that this work mode may have reduced their perceived need for negotiation, leading them to divert more attention to how language forms were used to convey the content messages, which resulted in more LREs.

Regarding the focus of LREs, the present findings suggest that learners paid equal attention to grammar and lexis, and resolved more LREs accurately regardless of task mode. This corroborates Rouhshad and Storch’s (2016) finding that task mode did not influence LRE focus and resolution, regardless of whether comparisons were made between FTF and text-based SCMC, or between text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC. One possible explanation to this finding could be the learners’ previous L2 writing instruction (see also Hsu, 2019). Prior to taking the junior English writing class where the current study was conducted, the learners had received writing instruction that largely focused on how to write grammatically and lexically correct sentences, in addition to how to write essays. This could have made the learners concerned about the use (and the accuracy) of language forms during writing, regardless of the mode in which the writing was conducted.

What is interesting in the current study’s findings is that though more collaborative pair dynamics were reported in text-based SCMC, there were no differences in the resolution of LREs in text-based SCMC and text-based ACMC. One possibility is that as LREs are defined and coded as any part of a dialogue where learners talk about or question the language produced or provide self- and other-corrections (Swain & Lapkin, 1998), it is possible that a linguistic problem was both raised and resolved by one learner in an LRE. This may explain why no differences were found in the resolution of LREs by text-based CMC mode, while more collaborative dynamics were found in text-based SCMC than text-based ACMC. This possibility was further supported by the LRE engagement level between the two modes. As the results suggested (Table  10), there were more elaborate than limited LREs in text-based SCMC; no difference was found between them in text-based ACMC. It stands to reason that though most LREs were resolved correctly, in text-based SCMC learners were more likely to engage with each other’s ideas to resolve LREs, which seemed not to be the case in text-based ACMC. In text-based ACMC, learners tended to work more individually. Even though there were 106 elaborate LREs (high-degree and low-degree elaborate LREs combined) generated in text-based ACMC (Table 9), 69 $( 6 5 \% )$ of them were contributed by the three groups that displayed collaborative pair dynamics (Table 4). Furthermore, though there were more elaborate LREs in text-based ACMC than in text-based SCMC (Table 10), when these elaborate LREs were broken down to high-degree and low-degree elaborate LREs (Table 9), there were more high-degree elaborate LREs in text-based SCMC $( 4 2 \% )$ but more low-degree elaborate LREs in text-based ACMC $( 4 9 \% )$ . In other words, during text-based ACMC collaboration the majority of learners did not collaborate very well. Though they attended to form more frequently, they did not engage very well with each other’s ideas in these interactions, and tended to either simply accept corrections from peers (reflected in more low-degree elaborate LREs; Table 9), identify and then repair the linguistic problems independently, or completely ignore peer feedback (reflected in more low-degree and high-degree limited LREs; Table 9). The latter finding also accords with the finding of Hsu (2019). Hsu has reported that when collaborating in web-based asynchronous collaborative L2 writing projects (via wikis), learners tended to overlook their writing peers’ feedback.

When interpreting the findings, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, the sample size is small; thus, type 2 errors15 are possible. Future studies could increase sample size to validate the present study’s findings. Secondly, the current study investigated the occurrence of collaborative pair dynamics and attention to form. Previous studies have suggested that collaborative pair dynamics create more learning opportunities (Li & Zhu, 2013; Storch, 2002), and that the more learners devote their attention to form (i.e. the higher their LRE engagement), the more opportunities they would have to develop their L2 (Storch, 2008). Though the current study did not investigate the L2 writing development effect, it revealed that task modality affects the occurrence of collaborative pair dynamics and the quality of attention to form (i.e. LRE engagement level). Differences in the occurrence of collaborative pair dynamics and the quality of attention to form due to different task modalities (i.e. text-based SCMC/ACMC) would affect the development of L2 writing. Future studies that examine the modality effects on L2 writing development in web-based contexts are warranted. Additionally, interaction patterns in this study were classified as collaborative and non-collaborative only. This dichotomy may not be able to fully capture the many nuances in the collaborative writing and interaction in either mode. Further studies that adopt a more detailed pattern classification framework are needed to reflect the nuances in interaction in the two text-based CMC modes. Finally, the current study did not record learners’ collaborative writing processes on an audio-video device, and thus, did not capture the amount of time learners spent on the task in each mode. It would be interesting for future studies to consider the factor of time on task variable to provide more insights into the modality of collaboration and attention to form in web-based collaborative L2 writing tasks.

# Conclusion

The current study’s purpose was to investigate the role of task modality in peer interaction patterns and attention to form in web-based L2 collaborative writing. The results indicate that when writing in text-based SCMC, learners collaborated better (i.e. generated more collaborative pair dynamics) and deliberated more extensively about language during collaboration (i.e. produced more elaborate LREs). Collaboration and elaborate focus on language seem to be relatively limited during text-based ACMC collaborative web-based writing projects. However, the present study does not seek to reject text-based ACMC collaboration, given its flexibility for engaging in out-of-class collaborative writing activities, allowing students to contribute whenever they want. This study’s findings also suggest that the text-based ACMC mode facilitated the attention to form with regard to the focus and resolution of LREs to a similar extent as its SCMC counterpart. However, when instructors implement collaborative text-based ACMC writing activities, such activities need to be more carefully designed and monitored. For instance, instructors may want to cultivate interaction mindset (Sato, 2013, 2017) and train students on how to collaborate and engage with each other’s contributions before text-based ACMC collaborative writing projects (Li, 2018; Liou & Peng, 2009;) and constantly check peer interaction and encourage collaboration to make text-based ACMC an optimal mode of interaction and ultimately language learning.

# Notes

1. A cooperative pattern differs from a collaborative pattern in that in a collaborative pattern, both participants contribute to the joint task and engage with each other’s contributions (reflected in high equality and mutuality).   
2. In Rouhshad and Neomy (2016), both participants could type and communicate instantly through text chat in SCMC; however, only one member of the pair could type the text on their Google Docs page.   
3. This study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University (approval number 201905ES136) and has been classified as an exempt. The requirement for consent was waived by the ethics committee.   
4. The learners had learned how to identify the thesis statement, topic sentences, and supporting details; how to check the relevance and organization of ideas; and how to check the language of their peers’ essays for grammatical accuracy, and give feedback.   
5. Week 1 on Table 1 indicates the first week of the study. It was actually the second week of the semester.   
6. The grading results were returned to the students when the collaborative writing tasks were completed so as to minimize the effect of grading and teacher feedback on students’ attention focus and patterns of interaction. That is, the grading results of collaborative writing task 1 were returned to the students when col

laborative writing task 2 was submitted. The grading results of collaborative writing task 2 were returned to the students one week after it was submitted.

7. This is also a text-based function.   
8. When changes or comments were made to a document, Google Docs sent notifications. Monitoring was then conducted. 9. In the present study, only scaffolding strategies that are responded to are coded as moderate to high mutuality.   
10. It is possible that students may change their interaction patterns during a single task performance. When this occurred in the study, the pattern that was predominant for the majority of their communication was coded.   
11. Pseudonyms are used.   
12. The transition between MREs often occurred in the form of confirmation (e.g. ok, sure), suggestions (e.g. okay, let’s move on), or questions (e.g. do you have other idea? another idea?). The transition between LREs occurred when a different focus appeared.   
13. Following Sauro and Smith (2010), effect sizes (r) were calculated by dividing the relevant z score by the square root of $_ \mathrm { N }$ ( $\mathbf { N } =$ the number of groups). An effect size of ${ \bf r } = 0 . 1 0$ was defined as small, ${ \bf r } = 0 . 3 0$ as medium and $\mathbf { r } { = } 0 . 5 0$ or larger as large.   
14. Following Takimoto (2006), this study used a modified Bonferroni procedure rather than a Bonferroni adjustment, which becomes too conservative with a large number of comparisons. The modified Bonferroni procedure works as follows: (1) $P$ -values are arranged from the lowest to the highest; (2) The significance of the first test (with the lowest $\boldsymbol { p }$ - value) is evaluated at $_ { 0 . 0 5 / 3 }$ (number of the tests) and if the test statistic is significant after this adjustment, then move on to the test with the second lowest $\pmb { \mathit { p } }$ - value and evaluate this statistic at $_ { 0 . 0 5 / 2 }$ (number of tests -1). If this statistic is significant after the adjustment, proceed to the third $\boldsymbol { p }$ - value and evaluate it at $_ { 0 . 0 5 / 2 }$ (number of tests-2); (2) Proceed in this fashion until a nonsignificant test statistic is obtained.

15. Type 2 errors occur when a null hypothesis is accepted when it should not have been accepted. Type 2 errors occur when $_ \mathrm { N }$ is small.
