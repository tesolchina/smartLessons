Participants were found to have abundant funds of knowledge, and the funds of knowledge intervention was found to have a positive effect on the quality of their narrative writing.

Cheng, X., Liu, Y., & Wang, C. (2023). Understanding student engagement with teacher and peer feedback in L2 writing. System, 119, 103176.

This study compared engagement with teacher and peer feedback among ten undergraduate EFL students in two English classes in China.

Data included human and machine scoring of these features in 356 essays written by L1- and L2-English children aged 8–11 in Canada. Human-machine score alignment was found to be sufficient for all traits; however, ML scores raised several validity concerns.

This study investigated how two secondary teachers in Hong Kong selected language features for focused written corrective feedback (WCF). Data included interviews and 48 drafts with teacher-provided WCF, collected from six focal students over one academic year. Findings showed that the teachers had limited awareness of which errors are amenable to focused WCF and that they struggled to select target errors, though this improved over time.

They found that participants drew extensively on visual metadiscourse resources to engage the audience, using interactive devices much more frequently than interactional devices. They propose a new visual metadiscourse framework that encompasses both interactive and interactional resources.

Li, M., Zhang, X., & Reynolds, B. L. (2023). Exploring lexical bundles in low proficiency level L2 learners’ English writing: An ETS corpus study. Applied Linguistics Review, 14(4), 847–873.

This corpus-based study investigated the use of four-word lexical bundles in 1330 TOEFL essays by low-proficiency EFL students from 11 language backgrounds. Findings showed overuse of prompt-related lexical bundles, stance expressions, and discourse organizers, and underuse of referential expressions in a majority of the essays. Several differences based on language background were found.

Li, Y. (2023). Facilitating genre transferability for multilingual writers in first-year composition [Unpublished doctoral dissertation]. Miami University of Ohio, USA.

The author considers reasons for the perception, espoused by some Canadian L2 writing researchers, that L2 writing is "not a thing" in their country. He suggests the lack of L2 writing-specific disciplinary infrastructure in Canada as a likely cause, and then he outlines ways in which L2 writing, as a phenomenon, developed over time, arguing that it has never been tied to a national context but has instead always been international.
