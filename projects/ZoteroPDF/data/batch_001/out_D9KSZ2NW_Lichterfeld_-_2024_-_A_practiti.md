This commentary attempts to offer a practitioner’s perspective on Chan (2019), which looks at how the communication skills of senior managers have changed throughout their careers. The findings of the study suggest that educators in ESP and higher education should prepare future leaders in a more long-term and holistic way so that they can become successful members of the business community. As they take up leadership functions, they will not only need an advanced proficiency of English but will have to use it as a lingua franca in business combined with relationship building, which requires relational language and soft skills. This repertoire will not only empower them but also create a company culture of trust and integrity for all the stakeholders. Educators in ESP and higher education need to prepare their learners to become holistic leaders and to overcome the challenges of workplace communication using English. This commentary discusses how Chan’s findings could also be used to inform corporate training/coaching. It also provides tasks intended to support course participants in learning more about themselves, their own values, and their beliefs that are important for long-term relationship building.

# 1. Introduction

In her study of long-term workplace communication needs of business professionals, Chan (2019) highlights the gap between language and communication skills that university graduates need when starting their professional career compared to those that senior managers have to show in changing leadership roles in their professional lives over the course of 20 years. Her study is based on the stories of three senior executives in the finance sector in Hong Kong, who shared their experiences in interviews. The research sought to answer the following key questions:

How do the language and communication needs of Hong Kong professionals change as they rise in rank?   
 What language- and communication-related difficulties have these professionals encountered at different stages of their careers?   
How have the professionals tried to overcome these difficulties? (Chan, 2019, p. 71)

The findings of her study clarify the importance of these topics for educators in ESP as well as for higher education institutions that want to support the development of future leaders.

# 2. Significance for practice

Chan’s (2019) study is not only relevant for Hong Kong, but also for “other parts of the world where English is commonly used as a lingua franca in business” (p. 71). Patel et al. (2023, p. 270) also stress that the global demand for English for employment is very high with an increased need for “all-around” employees with skills like, for example, teamworking and intercultural awareness that “come under the umbrella of 21-st century skills”.

Nearly all of Chan’s (2019) findings resonate with my own experiences as a freelance in-company trainerwith course participants in different industries, departments and at varying hierarchical levels in companies in Germany. Although English is taught as a foreign language in the German educational system, and thus does not play a similar role in private or public life as in Hong Kong, it is, however, crucial for the workplace and is considered indispensable at all levels of hierarchy (Ehrenreich, 2010, p. 408). After China and the United States, Germany is among the largest export nations worldwide and one in four jobs depends on exports, which form the foundation of the economy (Haghani and Holzamer, 2022). From my experience, the use of English for the workplace in Germany is similar to the situation that Chan (2019) describes in Hong Kong. Spoken communication is frequently carried out in German, whereas written communication is predominantly done in English because of globalization and the fact that there are many employees with an international background.

In addition to the impact of corporate culture on business communication that was mentioned by the senior executives in Chan’s study (2019, pp. 74/75), it is also worth looking at further culture-related aspects. Ehrenreich (2010) stresses that English is used as an “international contact language” and brings together people with different “linguacultural backgrounds” and levels of proficiency. Culture and identity are closely connected with language and described as “multiple, emergent, dynamic and at times contradictory”. In addition, as Baker (2018) notes, we do not meet nations, but individuals with different identities (gender, ethnic, generational, professional, cultural, regional, and religious etc.). From my experience, course participants need to be aware of the following: “All communication is intercultural in the sense of being interpersonal with people having their own specific cultures” (Kohn, 2022).

As Chan (2019) suggests, business people should not only be aware of discourse processes, but they should also have a good command of relational language and of tact and diplomacy. Kankaanranta et al. (2015) also illustrate the importance of viewing English on a continuum from ‘official English’ with a focus on Standardised English to English used as a ‘working language’ as BELF (English as Business Lingua Franca), where getting the job done and building rapport are considered as the main goals of successful communication among professionals, rather than linguistic accuracy. The authors also developed a framework of Global Communicative Competence (GCC) consisting of multicultural competence, competence in BELF and business knowhow. They note that employees communicate with different contact partners using BELF, through which they are able to achieve complex tasks such as promoting the company’s ultimate strategic goals, its mission (what the company does), its vision (where it is heading), and values (how things are done there). They underline the fact that while business knowhow or technical skills are crucial, these have to be combined with soft skills to maintain good relations. From my experience, this should be combined with storytelling in business English courses to support the course participants’ journeys of becoming a member of a specific business community. I discuss this in more detail below.

# 2.1. Using stories

Chan’s (2019) approach in interviewing the senior executives and valuing their stories as important parts of their professional lives is very useful, instead of just looking at their answers as a set of data. This is in line with the narrative focus that I incorporate into my training courses, which is based on the belief that “we organize our experience and our memory of human happenings mainly in the form of narrative” (Bruner, 1991, p. 4). When creating meaning in this way through social interaction, language and culture are intertwined and have a huge impact on (re-)constructing our self, our identities, and others’.

# 2.2. Relationship building with tact and diplomacy

Chan (2019) clarifies that interactions at a higher rank, in particular, do not only call for “advanced English proficiency but also for tact and diplomacy” (p. 68). Furthermore, Lichterfeld (2021) mentions several other elements of the communication that have an impact on decision-making processes and successful conversations. For example, speaking and listening are closely connected. As it takes two to tango, listener factors like the “ability of decoding authentic, fast, and spontaneous speech, familiarity with different accents and the listener’s attitudes or willingness to communicate” (p. 13) have to be considered too.

Chan (2019, p. 76) also emphasizes that there may be difficulties in understanding certain accents and that this may have an impact on building relationships in socializing events. Lippi-Green (2012, p. 72) shows how accent, (often unconscious) language ideology filters, culture, and mindset are connected:

The whole concept of units of conversation in which two partners work toward mutual comprehension assumes a certain state of mind on the part of the participants, and to an extent the question of skill. Intercultural competence is as crucial to successful communication as underlying motivation, solidarity, or hostility. (p.72)

Chan (2019) highlights that it is extremely important for senior executives to avoid making face threats to colleagues or hurting somebody’s feelings, e.g., when giving feedback. Apart from having an advanced proficiency in English, high levels of “communication skills, interpersonal skills and integrity” (p. 79) play a key role. And writing from a management perspective, Kline (2002, p. 13) illustrates how the creation of a trustful thinking environment can help individual employees, teams, and the organization to thrive in the long run.

Moreover, Chan (2019) notes the importance of leadership skills in ESP teaching and higher education. Her findings suggest that senior executives, as leaders of their organizations, add an interpersonal dimension to their workplace communication, which has implications also for coaching. As an article in Forbes (Tan, 2022) notes:

Coaching is an approach that involves helping someone embrace a new way of thinking, seeing, and acting in order to achieve a specific result. It enables people to see the world from a different perspective and find solutions to their challenges.

Studies such as these suggest that future leaders will need to enrich their leadership skills with relational language, soft skills, and personal qualities. This repertoire will not only empower them but also create a company culture of trust and integrity for all the stakeholders involved. Educators in ESP and higher education will need to prepare their learners to become holistic leaders and to overcome challenges of workplace communication using English.

# 3. Implications for teaching/training and suggestions for business English tasks

Chan’s (2019) findings show that the work-related skills of an employee have to be adapted to the contextual factors of each communication situation. In my experience, course participants usually need tasks that help them raise awareness of their own “linguacultural background” and they need to consider each communication partner as characterized by an individual plurilingual and pluricultural repertoire that is combined with linguistic and communicative competence in any (workplace) communication. Thus, the tasks shown below are intended to support course participants in learning more about themselves and their own values and beliefs (see Appendix A) that are important for long-term relationship building (see Section 2.), as follows:

Task 1 aims at raising awareness of a person’s plurilingual repertoire in the form of a timeline.

Task 2 gives an overview of different cultural identities and possible dynamics important for the development of ersonality.

Task 3 highlights that the course participant’s first language consists of several different accents and dialects.

Task 4 aims at increasing reflective practice and self-learning/informal learning.

Task 5 aims at creating a thinking environment with skills to coach subordinates.

# 3.1. Using stories and reflective practice

To understand the learners’ needs and contexts, it is useful to encourage them to tell stories about themselves. With regard to intercultural competence in particular, the use of critical incidents offers many advantages, as the narrative approach is also included in this type of activity and offers different perspectives on a situation. The Council of Europe (2023) offers many free materials that can be used “to encourage people to think about and learn from intercultural encounters they have had either face to face or through visual media such as television, magazines, films, the Internet.” Moreover, Camerer and Mader (2012) emphasize the key roles of metacommunication, metacognition and metalearning when aiming at intercultural competence, while Molinsky (2023) offers 10 powerful questions to step out of your personal and cultural comfort zones “without losing yourself in the process”.

# 3.2. Facilitating on-the-job learning

When considering the source of the difficulties that are inherent in workplace communication, Chan (2019) shows that former studies could not clarify whether they were caused by “a lack of technical knowledge in finances or from a lack of understanding of the discourse practices in the community of practice” (p. 71). According to Ehrenreich’s research in German multinational corporations (2010) and my own observations, employees seem to have often benefited more from learning in communities of practice than from formal English training. As “shared repertoire”, the use of BELF is socially embedded and dynamic, and based on a “tolerance for ambiguity”, “BELF is embraced as ‘theirs’” by the members of a community of practice (Ehrenreich, 2018).

Later studies by Chan (e.g. 2021a, 2021b) show the role of informal learning in the workplace and how to facilitate on-thejob learning of workplace communication for university students. Kankaanranta et al. (2015) also illustrate the importance of real-life experiences, such as using real-life business cases, internships, academic scholarships, and including business practitioner members in the Advisory Board of the university. In this way, we can support our course participants in setting up communities of practice focused on their workplace communication, which allow them to make the best use of the opportunities they offer by building close relationships within them.

# 4. Conclusions and future directions

To sum up, the importance of soft skills and above all coaching cannot be stressed enough. These topics are closely related to the impact of the narrative approach (Bruner, 1991). At the same time, it will be necessary to clearly define coaching, as many different forms can be found. As an accredited career and life coach, through the International Coaching Federation, with a focus on leadership coaching, I believe that future leaders cannot get in contact with coaching early enough in order to develop effective soft skills (in English). Thus, Chan’s findings could also be used to inform corporate training/coaching. Bridging the gap between research and practice is definitely one of the first steps to “nurture tomorrow’s leaders” (Chan, 2019, p. 68).

Download the 10 questions from Molinsky (2023) see the link above. Choose a situation.

Think of a situation where you have to step outside your comfort zone at work or at home

It should be something you want to learn to do better, but something that’s hard for you to do e.g. participating in a networking event, delivering a presentation, or giving negative feedback.

Ask yourself Molinsky’s 10 questions and write the answers in your journal:

1. What’s my doomsday version of this situation?   
2. If I’m being honest with myself, how likely is this doomsday scenario?   
3. What’s my dream version of how this situation unfolds?   
4. Again, if I’m being honest with myself, how likely is this dream scenario?   
5. What’s the most realistic version of how this situation unfolds?   
6. If I’m being honest with myself, how likely is this realistic version?   
7. If I didn’t experience any anxiety at all in this situationd if it were completely stress free d would it be something I’d   
like to try?   
8. And if it is stressful (at least at first) can I live with that?   
9. Most of us are good at rationalizing why things we fear aren’t worth doing. But can I brainstorm why this particular   
behavior I’m thinking about is actually worth it?   
10. What’s now stopping me from trying this behavior?
