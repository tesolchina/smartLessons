English-medium instruction (EMI) is on the rise in higher education (HE) across the globe. Despite this trend, a gap remains in the evaluation of EMI programs, leaving the question of what constitutes good practices in EMI largely unresolved. Moreover, the intersection between EMI and program evaluation is still elusive, resulting in a dearth of universally accepted guidelines and tools for evaluating EMI. This study introduces the English-Medium Instruction Q Evaluation (EMI-QE), an instrument designed to assess EMI in HE. The EMI-QE was demonstrated in a computer science program and was found to reflect several key strengths (e.g., lecturers’ confidence in using English and language support) and areas for improvement (e.g., lectures’ communication gaps and cultural sensitivity) of the program. In addition to addressing English proficiency and implementing an English certification policy, it was recommended that the program offer professional development on cultural sensitivity and inclusive teaching practices in order to address diversity issues, ensuring that all students, regardless of their backgrounds, are well supported.

# 1. Introduction

Due to English’s widespread use as a global lingua franca in various fields, English-medium instruction (EMI) is increasingly prevalent in higher education (HE). Defined as “the use of the English language to teach academic subjects (other than English itself) in countries or jurisdictions where the first language of the majority of the population is not English” (Macaro et al., 2018, p. 37), EMI has quickly spread in countries where English is not the primary language because of the belief that teaching in English will enhance students’ understanding of the subject matter while simultaneously improving their English proficiency, ultimately leading to greater socioeconomic opportunities (Evans & Morrison, 2018; Kumar Sah & Li, 2018; Manan et al., 2017). In developing nations, language education policies are often designed to promote EMI, as it is believed that equipping people with English competence contributes to national economic prosperity (Erling & Seargeant, 2013). As a result, EMI has evolved into a valuable form of linguistic capital that provides individuals with greater access to opportunities, increased influence, and the potential to achieve higher social status (Bourdieu, 1993).

However, even though EMI is on the rise in HE institutions (HEIs) worldwide, implementing it comes with its own set of challenges. Research has raised several concerns regarding the use of EMI “in the rush”, such as a lack of clear guidelines for teaching and assessment (Dearden, 2014), a shortage of qualified faculty members (Tseng et al., 2020), and the unreadiness of students (Soruc &

Griffiths, 2018). While EMI issues are often discussed within the pedagogical realm (e.g., teaching, learning, and assessing), Bradford (2016) highlights four types of EMI challenges encountered within and beyond classrooms: linguistic challenges, cultural challenges, structural challenges, and institutional challenges. Linguistic challenges arise when students or lecturers engage in academic activities using a language that is not their native tongue (e.g., insufficient English proficiency). Cultural challenges stem from the diverse academic and social norms of the student and lecturer populations, reflecting their different cultural backgrounds (e.g., students’ limited cultural background knowledge). Structural challenges have to do with the operational aspects of EMI (e.g., shortage of qualified lecturers). Institutional challenges involve the perceptions and self-identification of the EMI program within the broader institutional context, such as how it is viewed externally, its relationship with the rest of the HEIs, and its efforts to maintain standards. This categorization of EMI challenges, along with some others, transformed the EMI research paradigm into a more holistic perspective that encompasses not only instruction or academic outcomes but also program management.

The growing trend of EMI is also true in Thailand where the number of EMI programs in HE (known as international programs) has drastically increased in recent years. Thailand’s EMI policies are largely driven by the goal of internationalizing HE, with a focus on improving students’ English language skills (Lavankura, 2013). In these programs, lecturers were tasked with enhancing students’ English acquisition through content instruction, though the effectiveness of achieving these language learning objectives remains unclear (Sameephet, 2020). While EMI research in Asia has grown rapidly over the past decade, as documented by Macaro et al. (2018) and Lei and Hu (2023), only a few studies were conducted in Thailand. Despite the growing popularity of international programs in Thai HEIs, there is a lack of research focused on evaluating these programs, especially in terms of EMI implementation for quality assurance and management purposes. As Sahan et al. (2022) noted, EMI research into stakeholders’ views in Southeast Asia remains scarce. Involving various stakeholders ensures that the evaluation is holistic and grounded in the actual experiences of those directly affected by the program. This not only improves the relevance and practicality of the findings but also promotes a sense of ownership and commitment to implementing recommended improvements.

Although there has been a steady growth in EMI research, the intersection between EMI and program evaluation is still elusive, resulting in a dearth of universally accepted guidelines and tools for evaluating aspects of EMI within the context of HE. Such nexus holds great potential for EMI program management. Program evaluation in the realm of education often involves a vast range of stakeholders, such as students, teachers, alumni, administrators, and staff, and is designed to support institutional improvement and accountability (Bray, 2008). Program evaluation as a quality management tool is commonly adopted in HEIs. Despite facing challenges such as stakeholder opposition, a lack of evaluation resources, and difficulties implementing evaluation recommendations, program evaluation researchers continue to make ongoing efforts with a common goal: improving learning and teaching (Bray, 2008).

More attention to the evaluation of EMI programs is warranted by a long-term commitment to refine the capacity to design EMI programs that deliver expected results, rigorously analyze program impact, and improve program quality. The present study aims to develop an EMI evaluation tool, entitled the English-Medium Instruction Q Evaluation (EMI-QE), with the goal of assessing various aspects of EMI, including the language, structural, cultural, and resource aspects of the program. The EMI-QE is based on the principles of Q methodology (Q)—a systematic means to assess subjective experiences and viewpoints (Stephenson, 1953). After its introduction to applied linguistics (Irie, 2014; Thumvichit, 2024a), Q has been adopted to study a variety of topics in the field (Morea & Ghanbar, 2024). Q deserves more attention, especially in the field of English for Academic Purposes (EAP), where there is a lack of research interests in methodological issues, and there is a need for practitioners to provide concise evaluations of what works well and what does not (Bell, 2022). In addition, subjective self-evaluation has been underaddressed. There has been a call for future research using alternative methods to evaluate these programs with more attention to subjective experience (Guo et al., 2022).

This study centers on the development of the EMI-QE. We hypothesize that the EMI-QE can help evaluators identify what works well and what needs improvement in programs with respect to their EMI implementation. It can also contribute to EAP practices and pedagogy by identifying specific areas where students struggle with English and by integrating EAP lessons with subject content. This article is structured as follows. It begins with an overview of EMI specific to the context of HE. We then discuss the potentials of Q in program evaluation. This is followed by a description of the EMI-QE development and an illustrative evaluation. The results are then presented and discussed, followed by a discussion of the applications of the EMI-QE. Concluding remarks are provided in the final section.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. EMI in HE

The expansion of EMI in HE is evident in HE throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Asia in recent decades, despite opposition in some countries (e.g., Bangladesh) (Macaro et al., 2018). Various EMI-related factors that impact students’ learning outcomes have been thoroughly studied (Costa & Coleman, 2013). In EMI programs, students should improve their subject-specific language abilities and general language proficiency for better acquisition of subject content and classroom engagement (Zhang & Pladevall-Ballester, 2022). The degree to which students can enhance their English proficiency may greatly impact their use of English and interaction in the classroom, which can encourage (or hinder) their improvement in both language and subject content acquisition. Multiple studies have shown the positive impacts of EMI on language learning, offering different explanations for these advantages (e.g., Hu & Wu, 2020; Jiang & Zhang, 2019; Xie & Curle, 2022). One possible explanation for the positive effects is that EMI creates an environment that naturally increases students’ immersion in the language (van der Worp, 2017). An additional explanation could be that EMI offers students more opportunities to use English in both day-to-day and academic settings, where it functions as the primary medium of communication and classroom interaction. Research also reported that EMI can enhance students’ disciplinary content learning without negatively affecting their overall academic performance (Dafouz & Camacho-Minano,˜ 2016), leading to positive attitudes toward EMI among teachers and students alike (Ball & Lindsay, 2013). These findings, along with many others, suggest that EMI not only benefits language acquisition but also supports academic success, contributing to the broader acceptance and implementation of EMI programs worldwide. Moreover, the increased use of English in academic contexts can prepare students for global job markets, where English proficiency is often a valuable asset.

Nevertheless, a number of empirical investigations into EMI yielded unfavorable outcomes. Some studies show that inadequate language proficiency can hinder successful teaching and learning in EMI programs. That is, students are likely to struggle to understand lessons and may need extra support to help them finish their courses and assignments. This places great strain not only on students but also teachers (Wilkinson, 2013), forcing them to use their L1. As such, when teachers use such a compensation strategy to ease classroom teaching, learning of disciplinary content may suffer (Beckett & Li, 2012). Some studies contend that EMI worsens educational inequities by favoring certain institutions and individuals with the resources to compete in the “English race” (Costa & Coleman, 2013). Such an issue is tied to socioeconomic disparities, affecting the availability of resources in institutions and for students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. For instance, students from wealthier backgrounds may have access to better English education resources outside of school, giving them an advantage in EMI programs. These challenges highlight the need for careful consideration and targeted support to ensure that EMI programs are equitable and effective for all students.

In response to the aforementioned concerns and uncertainties in assessing the overall advantages and disadvantages of EMI raised by Macaro et al. (2018), a number of empirical EMI evaluations have been carried out. For example, Guo et al. (2022) employed multivariate analysis through the partial least square structural equation modeling approach to identify various factors that influence students’ performance in EMI programs. Their findings revealed some factors that directly influence students’ learning process, including students’ effort, students’ prior knowledge, and course quality. Another notable example is Hendriks and van Meurs’s (2022) evaluation of EMI lectures compared to L1 lectures. That is, lectures were evaluated through a Likert-type questionnaire focusing on proficiency, accent, comprehension, comprehensibility, attitudes toward the lecturer, and perceived teaching quality of the lecturer. They found that using EMI instead of L1 does not seem to diminish comprehension; however, it leads to more negative views of the lecturer, with non-native pronunciation playing a role in these perceptions. While both studies (and others) offer practical implications for program management, EMI evaluations are largely limited in terms of method and design. This limitation has led to calls for alternative or complementary approaches that can better address the subjective experiences within EMI programs (Guo et al., 2022). Therefore, the following section discusses the concept of Q evaluation as a systematic tool for exploring subjectivities in language programs and its potential in program evaluation.

# 2.2. Q evaluation

William Stephenson, the inventor of Q, was initially more interested in understanding what sets individuals apart rather than discovering trends across large populations (Wigger & Mrtek, 1994). He challenged the traditional research design, which assumes people are similar except for particular errors. Therefore, he advocated for the hypothesis that each individual is different unless proven otherwise (Stephenson, 1961). His method focused on individuals’ measurements of themselves rather than the measurements of individuals. In other words, Stephenson became more interested in personal perceptions and subjective experiences.

Originating from both quantitative and qualitative research traditions, Q aims to provide researchers with a deeper understanding of individuals’ subjective experiences. This method enables the investigation of life from the perspective of the people living it, the recognition of shared characteristics among those with similar viewpoints, and the examination of attitude shifts at specific instances or over time (Brown, 1996; Dennis, 1986). Essentially, Q is designed to “focus on the discovery and understanding of individuals as complex, holistic beings” (Wigger & Mrtek, 1994, p. 9). In contrast to traditional factor analysis, Stephenson’s method establishes relationships between individuals instead of merely among opinions.

McKeown and Thomas (2013) assert that Q is used to examine people’s subjectivities on an area of interest as well as their internal self-reference. The Q process is based on “operant subjectivity”, where people communicate their thoughts in an impactful or useful way (Watts & Stenner, 2012). This refers to the interaction between individuals’ beliefs, opinions, ideas, thoughts, attitudes, and notions in light of their event (Stephenson, 1961). In this sense, Q attracts scholars who are interested in human behaviors and attitudes. In Q research, unique data collection and statistical analysis methods are employed. Subjectivity is proven by participants’ rating statements about a particular issue, and then by-person factor analysis is used to locate participants’ common viewpoints. Q is designed to gather “key opinions existing among a group of participants and allow those viewpoints to be grasped holistically and to a high level of qualitative detail” (Watts & Stenner, 2012, p. 4).

In the field of program evaluation, the shortcomings of conventional research methods have become increasingly apparent. An expanding body of research has recognized the potential of Q in program evaluation (e.g., Brewer-Deluce et al., 2020; Ramlo, 2015). Brewer-Deluce et al. (2020), for example, argued that traditional self-report questionnaires fail to capture the full spectrum of individual perspectives, while qualitative data gleaned from interviews can be limited, fragmented, and challenging to analyze and draw consistent conclusions. These conventional evaluation methods may yield impractical recommendations for program improvement, whereas Q can help pinpoint evidence-based areas for strengthening and refining the program in alignment with students’ needs (Brewer-Deluce et al., 2020). As such, Q offers an effective solution to the persistent challenges of course evaluation (Brewer-Deluce et al., 2020). There have been several researchers who have successfully used Q in course and program evaluation within the contexts of HE. For instance, Collins and Angelova (2015) evaluated a graduate course in a Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) program using Q. The findings revealed three separate viewpoints, namely, improved learning via group activities, preference for individual work, and improved learning through internet activities. These points of view are less likely to be uncovered by self-report questionnaires. Jurczyk and Ramlo (2004) utilized Q to conduct evaluations of various undergraduate physics and chemistry courses over several semesters. Q sorting in this study (the data collection procedure in Q research) included statements reflecting the overall course outline, lecture quality, lab quality, lecturers, and lab teachers. Despite the fact that their evaluations only covered a small number of students in certain courses, they demonstrated that the use of Q as an evaluation tool for course-wide evaluations is effective. As demonstrated in a recent collection of Q articles edited by Fraschini et al. (2024), Thumvichit (2024b) explicitly proposed a practical framework for using Q for the evaluation of language programs—under the concept of $Q$ evaluation. Language programs in this sense can refer to a wide range of programs and courses, such as specific language courses (e.g., specific language skills, language specific purposes, and general language proficiency), EMI programs, and even informal tutoring sessions. Based on key principles of program evaluation and Q, Q evaluation follows six sequential steps: defining the purpose of evaluation, identifying the stakeholders, developing the Q sample, administering the Q sort, data analysis, and interpretation. While these steps appear similar to typical steps in Q research, there are some unique elements that set this concept slightly apart from the traditional Q. First, defining the purpose of evaluation in Q evaluation is a process referred to as constructing the program theory (Harris et al., 2019). Conducting a needs assessment as part of program evaluation helps educational programs meet increasing accountability expectations (Marrs & Helge, 1978). For a successful needs assessment, evaluators can devise and present a set of queries to stakeholders. These queries aim to identify areas requiring attention and clarify how the evaluation can assist in tackling these issues (Thumvichit, 2024b). Second, in line with the realist evaluation, the aim of Q evaluation is to find out “what works for whom, why and in what circumstances within programs” (Harris et al., 2019, p. 3). This means that evaluators must be cautious about the program’s objectives which differ from program to program and may change over time. Third, Q evaluation focuses on involvement of both primary stakeholders (e.g., students and lecturers) and secondary stakeholders (e.g., administrators, staff, and policymakers). While primary stakeholders can offer direct insights into the day-to-day experiences and challenges, secondary stakeholders may provide a broader context, incorporating institutional goals, administrative support, and policy implications.

Brewer-Deluce et al. (2020) noticed that their well-established undergraduate anatomy course saw little benefit from frequent evaluations, as they consistently received positive survey ratings and uninformative feedback from open-ended questions. For this reason, they used Q evaluation in addition to traditional evaluation methods to obtain holistic information and reported that students had diverse preferences regarding course components. Such findings led to various recommendations for course improvement. As Ramlo (2012) noted, the use of Q in the HE context can be a flexible tool for a variety of goals, such as needs assessment and program evaluation, where faculty and/or student perspectives are critical. However, current evidence suggests that Q is used primarily by scholars rather than stakeholders. Future researchers are advised to somehow involve program designers in order to facilitate participatory evaluation and obtain authentic insights into the program under evaluation.

# 3. Methodology

In this study, we developed the EMI-QE as a method to assess EMI components in HE programs. Q requires participants to assign a specific value to each statement in a forced-distribution format in order to evaluate a phenomenon of interest (Block, 1978). Based on general guidelines for Q research (Brown, 1980) and specific guidelines for applying Q evaluation (Thumvichit, 2024b), this study was carried in two sequential stages (see Fig. 1). We first described the process by which the EMI-QE was developed. This was followed by an illustrative evaluation, in which a multiple-participants design (Watts & Stenner, 2012) was incorporated into the EMI-QE to evaluate an EMI program.

# 3.1. Defining the purpose

To define the purpose, we interviewed 30 individuals who played different roles (i.e., program administrators, lecturers, support staff, and students) in several EMI programs offered by three universities in Thailand. Since the objective was to find out why this evaluation is needed, informants were asked broad questions, such as How do you normally evaluate your program? (for program administrators, lecturers, and support staff), How do you normally evaluate your teaching? (for lecturers), and more specific questions about EMI, such as Are there any institutional or national policies that you must follow when managing EMI programs? (for program administrators, lecturers, and support staff), and What are the challenges and opportunities associated with EMI in your program? (for program administrators, lecturers, and students). One common observation regarding institutional and national policies was that there were no specific guidelines for designing, operating, and evaluating the EMI aspects of the program. In light of this, we grounded the development in the perspectives expressed by stakeholders. Based on the interviews, the purpose of the EMI-QE is to identify and profile the strengths and areas for improvement of the programs in terms of EMI, corresponding to the practical nature of Q evaluation (Thumvichit, 2024b). It is noteworthy that the EMI-QE is designed exclusively for evaluating EMI components of the programs. Therefore, unlike previous studies (e.g., Hendriks & van Meurs, 2022; Guo et al., 2022), our study does not cover domains outside the scope of EMI (e.g., teachers’ subject knowledge, applications of subject knowledge, and general academic skills).

# 3.2. Generating EMI-QE items

After securing ethical approval, this study began with the development of the concourse—a bank of items related to the topic. For the EMI-QE, the concourse was derived from diverse sources including interview data (see Section 3.1), relevant literature, evaluation criteria, curriculum documents, and students’ feedback. These materials contributed to the formulation of statements for the concourse, in which we broadly categorized EMI components into four domains, namely language, structure, culture, and resource (see Table 1). The items from the concourse were subsequently sent to the faculty for feedback, leading to the revision, removal, and addition of some items.

Then, a panel of eight external experts (i.e., experienced EMI researchers and lecturers in EMI programs) was convened to review the items. Item Content Validity Index (I-CVI) was used to determine the validity of the items (Waltz & Bausell, 1981). Although typically associated with traditional survey methodology, using I-CVI in a Q study systematically helps ensure that the statements used for Q sorting accurately represent the intended domains (see Thumvichit, 2024c). The experts were invited to rate each item on a scale of 1–4. I-CVI was computed as the number of experts rating 3 or 4 for each item divided by the number of experts. I-CVI scores range from 1 to 0. Items with I-CVI scores of over 0.79 were considered relevant, whereas those with I-CVI scores of less than 0.70 were eliminated. However, items with I-CVI scores of between 0.70 and 0.79 were subject to revision. The final list of items comprises 40 items (see Appendix).

# 3.3. Identifying the participants

An illustrative evaluation was conducted at a government-run university. The aim was to evaluate a computer science program, which was deemed a good representative of typical EMI programs in Thailand as the vast majority of students and lecturers are Thai, and most of them are transitioned from Thai-medium instruction programs. Moreover, Computer Science is a discipline that relies heavily on English (Bolton & Kuteeva, 2012). This program operates in parallel with an identical program that uses Thai-medium instruction. Like most international programs in Thailand, it is rooted in a Thai program, which distinguishes it from international programs administered by international institutions that are designed from the outset to accommodate a more international environment. This rootedness in the national educational system ensures that the program’s structure, curriculum, and administration are aligned with national standards and practices, making this illustrative evaluation a practical guideline for many EMI programs nationwide.

Participation in this evaluation was entirely voluntary, and 40 current students expressed their interest and thus volunteered to participate. This sample size achieves the 1:1 ratio of statements to participants (Watts & Stenner, 2005). Their age ranged from 18 to 21. Nine of them are females and 31 of them are males.

# 3.4. Data collection

All participants were asked to perform a card-sorting task (Q sorting). Each of them independently sorted each item into a forceddistribution grid. In order to fit each item into the grid, they were instructed to compare between items in the way that the final configuration best represented their thought. That is, the items (hereafter statements) were sorted by each participant in one sitting in terms of “the program as it currently is.” A pilot test was administered with 10 students in a different program to ensure the clarity of the instructions, after which some modifications were made.

Since Q sorting was unfamiliar to the students, we met them to introduce the research, provide ethical information, and demonstrate the Q sorting procedure. After that, the participants were provided with a link to a web-based application—Q Method Software—where they were given one week to sort all statement cards by dragging and dropping them onto an 11-column grid ranging from − 5 (most unlikely) to 5 (most likely), with 0 representing a neutral stance (see Fig. 2). The statements were randomly presented to prevent any order effects that might influence participants’ responses. In addition to this, participants were asked to rate the overall quality of EMI in the program on a scale of 1–5. However, we acknowledged that participants might provide responses they believe are expected or socially desirable rather than their true opinions, even though Q is known for mitigating social desirability bias (Watts & Stenner, 2012). To further address this concern, participants were assured that their participation would not affect their academic standing or grades in any way.

# 3.5. Data analysis and post-sort interviews

Q employs an inverted factor analysis to identify clusters of people based on their shared viewpoints (Stephenson, 1936). In this evaluation, we used the Ken-Q Analysis Desktop Edition (KADE) application (Banasick, 2019)—a software package for the computation of Q data—to analyze the data. Principal component analysis and varimax rotation were used for factor extraction. The baseline criteria included an eigenvalue greater than 1 and at least four Q sorts significantly loading on a single factor. The analysis identified eight factors with eigenvalues exceeding 1 (see Fig. 3). Statistical significance was established at a $p$ -value threshold of 0.05. The results convinced us to adopt the three-factor solution, as it excluded fewer participants compared to other factor solutions. The analysis showed that 36 participants significantly loaded onto one factor (see Table 2), accounting for $3 5 \%$ of the variance, meeting the acceptable threshold (Watts & Stenner, 2012). A one-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in the overall quality of EMI $( F ( 2 , 3 3 ) = 4 . 3 5$ , $p = 0 . 0 2 \mathrm { , }$ ).

Post-sort interviews were held with nine students who demonstrated the highest factor loading values for each factor. The goal was to gather their reflective thoughts, which was done by asking probing questions like, “we see you’ve given this statement a rating of 4; could you give us the reason?” The interview excerpts were used to support the interpretation. The interpretation is mainly guided by characterizing (those placed both ends of the continuum), distinguishing (those uniquely defining each group), and consensus (those agreed upon by all groups) statements.

# 4. Results

The following subsections present the results of the analysis. Participants were divided into three groups, each representing a unique profile of students’ perspectives and experiences with the program. The position of each statement is provided in parentheses, indicated by the statement number—using “E” followed by the statement value, which is its placement on the sorting grid (− 5 to 5).

# 4.1. Profile 1: Multifaceted nature of English in EMI

Fourteen students (four females and 10 males) loaded significantly on Profile 1, which had an eigenvalue of 6.62, accounting for $1 7 \%$ of the explained variance. Their ages ranged from 18 to 20. This group rated the overall quality of EMI the highest $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 9 3$ ; SD $= 0 . 8 2 9 $ ).

The strength of the program largely attributed to lecturers’ confidence in using English in the classroom (E7, 5). Their confidence not only played a role in making students feel more at ease. When lecturers were comfortable and proficient in their communication, they promoted a more engaging atmosphere in the classroom.

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="4"</table></body></html>

Students also reported that all communication channels were carried out in English (E27, 4). Students noted that all forms of communication within the program, both within and beyond the classroom, were conducted in English. The consistent use of English across all channels not only provided students with comfort in using English in academic and day-to-day settings but also improved their English skills.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt 3:</td><td>Since al our commncaton is in English i&#x27;s become  natural part of my day. &#x27;m more relaxd using Engish now and always wante to have this environment where everyone speaks English naturally.</td></tr></table></body></html>

In addition, students also felt that students demonstrate sufficient English proficiency to study in the program (E16, 4) as they did not find themselves struggling to understand the lectures and complete assignments.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt 4:</td><td>We can  e  i te   t nt ather than struggig with the anguage.  havent heard any complans from my friends aout this; eryone sms o be managing just fie..</td></tr></table></body></html>

This finding also signifies the effectiveness of recruitment. In this program, students must demonstrate at sufficient proficiency in an A-level English and pass an English interview. This could also reflect the effectiveness of English courses which were designed to prepare students for intensive use of English in the international program and in the industry.

However, on the negative end which we considered as areas where improvement might be necessary, students felt that classroom discussion fell short as a result of limited language proficiency (E13, − 5). This might sound contradictory to the placement of E16, but it indicates that while the general level of English proficiency meets the program’s requirements, there were still disparities in language skills among students that affected more interactive aspects in the classroom.

short-term basis.

Profile 1 reflects the experiences of students who rated the overall quality of EMI highly, attributing this to the lecturers’ confidence in using English, which promoted a positive classroom environment. The consistent use of English across all communication channels further enhanced students’ proficiency and comfort with the language. However, the profile also highlights areas needing improvement, such as limited classroom discussion depth due to limited English proficiency, a gap between theoretical and practical language use, and a lack of cultural diversity in the program.

# .2. Profile 2: Students’ language readiness and lecturers’ communication gaps

Profile 2 comprised 12 students (two females and 10 males). This profile had an eigenvalue of 3.94, explaining $1 0 \%$ of the total variance. Their ages ranged from 18 to 20. The average rating for the overall quality of EMI was 3.08 $\mathbf { \nabla } S \mathbf { D } = 0 . 9 0 $ ).

On the positive side, similar to those in Profile 1, students in this group mutually agreed that students showed no sign of struggle in terms of English (E16, 5). They also felt that the field-specific content is easier to understand when presented in English (E19, 4), reflecting the suitability of English for conveying technical or specialized information in this field, due to the availability of more original resources in English.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt 6:</td><td>I don&#x27;t haveo trasat this into Thi. The English versin is ao ier to undersad and I think sing Thai translaions makes things harder... Simple terms uch as r interace and oprating system are more clerly define in gis. . It s alo lo eier to mmorize that way.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Timely language support was also considered a strength of the program (E24, 4) as students were required to take at least one English course each semester for three academic years. These courses were taught by native speakers of English who were hired specifically by the faculty to instruct students in international programs.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt 7:</td><td>Whe firsteth ra it ok m me timodjt..

Excerpt 7 illustrates the initial challenge faced by students upon entering the program was their lack of experience with international programs. The transition period required some adjustment, during which English courses were found to be beneficial. These courses not only helped improve English proficiency but also supported students in studying other content courses.

On the other hand, the negative end of the sorting grid was loaded with statements related to lecturers. The area for improvement of the program mainly had to do with lecturers who failed to use English to communicate effectively in the classroom (E1, $^ { - 5 ) }$ , notice students’ language difficulties (E5, − 4), and promote English usage in everyday situations (E3, $^ { - 4 ) }$ .

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt 8: Excerpt 9:</td><td>Their language sounds to rigid, which can make the lectures harder o follo. . It&#x27; even harder when we discuss complicated topics.

These findings well justify why lessons were difficult to follow (E4, − 3) and why they did not feel that they were encouraged to improve their English (E2, $^ { - 2 ) }$ . Upon revisiting the overall quality of EMI rated by students, compared with the other groups, these students were least satisfied. This implies that lecturers played a vital role in the overall quality of EMI in the program.

Profile 2 represents students who demonstrated strong language readiness and found English suitable for understanding technical content. They also felt supported by timely language courses. However, the profile revealed some striking areas where attention is needed, such as ineffective use of English, lack of recognition of students’ language difficulties, and insufficient encouragement for English use beyond academics.

# 4.3. Profile 3: Language support and cultural sensitivity

Ten students (one female and nine males) loaded significantly on Profile 3, which had an eigenvalue of 3.12, accounting for $8 \%$ of the explained variance. Their ages ranged from 18 to 21. The overall quality of EMI rated by students was 3.10 $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { S D } = 0 . 7 3 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ .

Profile 3 emphasizes the management of the program as a means of providing language support to students. That is, students reported that the program offered the opportunities for them to improve their English (E28, 5) and various channels for English communication (E39, 4).

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt</td><td>Apart fro aking ish orr seeer, th fer hrt-tem s abrr for the ser. nt g t it&#x27; gothat</td></tr><tr><td>11:</td><td>they have this option for students.

These excerpts imply that students recognized support from program management as a bridge to improve their English, extending to even subtle aspects like communication channels. This means that integrating English into everyday tools such as messaging applications not only facilitated informal practice but also embedded the language into their daily lives. In contrast to those in Profile 2, these students leaned toward the positive side when it comes to lecturers’ communication in the classroom (E1, 3).

However, similar to Profile 2, the negative side of the grid was dominated by factors related to lecturers. Students indicated that lecturers were not culturally sensitive in the classroom (E35, − 5) and did not culturally diversify examples presented to them (E34, $^ { - 4 ) }$ .

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt</td><td>Our clas s  e tds wo a Thi, n smetime t sms like r cters at ae of this diesit. .

The lack of sensitivity to the diverse cultural backgrounds of students may alienate students and disconnect them from the lesson, especially non-native students. Excerpt 14 reveals a concern about the disconnect between the content and the contexts that could be meaningful to the students. The feedback about the overly “textbook” examples indicates that the curriculum might be missing opportunities to engage students with more relevant examples that reflect the specific markets they will serve.

Profile 3 represents students who appreciated several aspects of the program, such as English courses, study abroad programs, and informal communication channels that facilitated day-to-day English practice. However, they also noted that lecturers lacked cultural sensitivity and failed to diversify examples in the classroom, which could alienate students and disengage them from the learning content.

# 4.4. Consensus statements

Consensus statements are those sorted in a similar way across the participant groups, indicating commonality that can provide useful information. We found two aspects of the program that were neutrally sorted: audio-visual aids used in the classrooms that make English content easy to understand (E12) and the courses incorporating content both in local and international contexts (E29). The neutral consensus suggests that while both the use of audio-visual aids and the integration of local and international content are generally relevant to EMI and students’ learning, they did not particularly excel or fall short in a way that notably impacts the implementation of EMI. However, students tended to agree with the technology used to support learning field content through English (E38).

<html><body><table><tr><td>Excerpt</td><td>Ilike th to in e e.e th a  th    s e y  qk o the</td></tr><tr><td>15:</td><td>up.</td></tr><tr><td>Excerpt</td><td>Usi ni is  .. e  e     isi  a n iik  th  t</td></tr><tr><td>16:</td><td>are written in easy English that I can understand.</td></tr></table></body></html>

The agreement reflects that the program well integrated technological aids, such as digital textbooks, online resources, interactive platforms, and learning management system, that served students in terms of EMI and English learning.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. The illustrative evaluation

The illustrative evaluation of an EMI program offers useful information for program management. By leveraging the strength of Q, the EMI-QE is able to unfold the subjectivities regarding students’ experiences to accommodate a complex nature of program evaluation. We must note that statistical significance alone did not provide a complete picture of the findings. Our decision to conduct follow-up interviews was driven by the need to capture the practical significance.

Throughout this study, we treated EMI not only as a linguistic component but also as pedagogical (He & Chiang, 2016), managerial (NG Chin Leong, 2017), and cultural means (Bradford, 2016) that influence learning in the program. Three profiles of students’ experiences emerged from the analysis. Upon closer examination of each profile, we identified three unique combinations of viewpoints, each highlighting the program’s strengths and areas for improvement as they manifest in daily academic and social interactions. These combinations emphasize two crucial aspects of the program that deserve attention: the lecturers and the support system.

# 5.1.1. The EMI lecturers

One key strength of the program is lecturers’ confidence in using English. Although most of the lecturers were Thai, they demonstrated a high level of self-confidence in English, leading to students feeling at ease and promoting an interactive atmosphere. This is evident from their lack of hesitation while giving lectures and the consistency in their projected voices. Literature in educational psychology indicates that students evaluate instruction more negatively when teachers are anxious in the classroom (Frenzel et al., 2016). In language education, teachers’ confidence to use the target language is often discussed in the realm of language anxiety, which can be shown in teachers’ ability to present the target language effectively—in our case, the specialized content through the target language—interact with students, and serve as a positive role model for students (Horwitz, 1996).

As far as lecturers’ English proficiency is concerned, most lecturers in the program had educational degrees from abroad and were trusted by the program committee to instruct EMI courses. Despite the lack of an “English certified” requirement, they were deemed to be “English proficient” in Richards and Pun’s (2023, p. 225) classification of EMI content teachers. The term “proficiency” can be misunderstood and used interchangeably to refer to different aspects: the knowledge of technical vocabulary specific to a discipline, the confidence with academic vocabulary, and the ability to articulate the in-depth meaning of a concept within the subject (Macaro, 2020; Macaro et al., 2021). However, lecturers were also identified as an area for improvement of the program. Students in Profile 2 reported experiencing difficulties with the lecturers’ speech, which they found to be “too rigid.” This issue can be further explained by their expectations (refer to Excerpt 10). That is, students might expect more than just effective content delivery; they felt that English should be a part of the whole learning process. This means that the social aspect of classroom teaching was also an expectation. In the EMI context, the specialized communicative skills (Richards & Pun, 2022) and discipline-specific pedagogical competence of teachers (Yuan, 2020) are often prioritized over their general language proficiency. In our evaluation, we argue that the latter is also (or no less) important, as it facilitates deep discussions and interactive social activities. The role of English in EMI programs has expanded far beyond content delivery; it now includes using the language to connect with students and create a supportive learning environment. The findings also indicate that lecturers missed students’ language difficulties and thus failed to provide spontaneous support. As found by Guarda (2021), improved English proficiency remains pivotal even in content subjects and can outweigh other aspects such as comprehension difficulties.

In addition, another area for improvement worth mentioning is lecturers’ awareness of diversity. Since most of the students in the program were Thai L1 speakers, teachers might occasionally overlook the presence of foreign students. For example, they might use Thai idioms or cultural references that were unfamiliar to non-Thai students. This issue is known as cultural challenges, which can result in student resistance and exclusion (Bradford, 2016). When English veils a single academic discourse, the implementation of EMI can be impeded (Wong & Wu, 2011), especially when it does not account for the diverse cultural backgrounds of students. EMI research has raised concerns regarding the use of students’ L1 and/or translanguaging (Galloway et al., 2020). While the use of L1 has been reported to support content learning effectively (Hu & Lei, 2014), issues arise with foreign students who do not understand the home students’ L1 (Lei & Hu, 2023). This oversight is likely to occur in programs where almost all students speak the same language as the lecturers and thus minority students who may not share the same linguistic and cultural background can be easily overlooked.

# 5.1.2. The support system

Support systems for EMI are an emerging topic that has received growing interest (e.g., Galloway & Ruegg, 2020). In this illustrative evaluation, the support system emerged as one of the program’s strengths. While previous literature highlights the lack of support (McKinley et al., 2021) and calls for more assistance measures (Kim et al., 2021), the program under evaluation demonstrated several attempts to provide language support to students. First, the effort to create an immersive language atmosphere is evident through the constant use of English in all communications. The findings, as indicated in Excerpt 3, show that a student reported English has become a natural part of their daily routine. Given that many students in the program came from Thai secondary programs, such an atmosphere could help accelerate the adjustment process and make them feel more comfortable using English in their day-to-day communication within and beyond the classroom. Since universities typically expect greater learning autonomy compared to secondary schools (Macaro et al., 2019), resources outside the classroom, such as an immersive environment, are considered crucial for students to effectively enhance their language skills and adapt to the demands of HE. Therefore, the program encouragement of using English on social media platforms was also found advantageous, not only making lecturers and staff more approachable but also integrating English into students’ social media lives.

Second, the program offered its students intermittent opportunities for outbound study and to study alongside inbound exchange students who brought diverse cultural perspectives to the program. This practice is known as the bidirectional internationalization of higher education (Lei & Hu, 2023), where both domestic and international students benefit from mutual exchanges of cultural and academic knowledge. However, a noticeable imbalance was spotted, as the number of international students was very low, constituting only about $6 \%$ of the total current student body and only three were from the exchange program. Of these, almost all of them were Chinese students.

Third, structured English courses, which were the primary explicit language support, were recognized to be beneficial to students. As Bradford and Brown (2018) observed, with the rise of EMI programs, the distinction between language courses taught by language lecturers—designed to meet the needs for EAP—and academic content courses taught in English by content lecturers through lectures has become increasingly blurred. Although the disconnect between content and English-subject courses has been problematic in EMI programs (Lin, 2016), the findings revealed that students greatly benefited from this form of support. When taking a look at their study plan, we could divide English courses into two types: English for specific purposes (e.g., technical English) and English for a specific skill (e.g., academic writing). The former was provided in the first semester, and the latter in the second semester, of each of the first three academic years. This means that students would receive a well-rounded foundation in English, equipping them with both specialized terminology relevant to their fields and essential skills for academic and professional communication. The success of these courses was demonstrated by the students’ sufficient proficiency to study in the program, as reported by students across the three groups. This timely support was pushed further by English teachers who attempted to connect the English courses with content courses. As seen in Excerpt 7, the English teachers helped students with the language used in their assignments for content courses. Such interplay between content and English courses is referred to as a “complementary or supportive relationship” (Richards & Pun, 2023, p. 224).

# 5.1.3. Limitations

This evaluation is not without its limitations. First, due to the voluntary nature of participant involvement, the diversity of participants in terms of age, year of study, and other demographic factors might not fully represent the broader student population in the program. This lack of representativeness could limit the generalizability of the findings within the program. Second, this study focused primarily on the perspectives of students, without including other stakeholders such as lecturers and administrators. The perspectives and experiences of various stakeholders in the evaluation of educational programs are recommended to address issues of social validity of evaluation tools (Rodl et al., 2020). Another limitation is related to online Q sorting. The absence of researchers during online sorting means that participants could not receive timely support if they encountered difficulties or had questions.

# 5.1.4. Implications

A number of implications for program management can be drawn from the evaluation. Given the importance of both English proficiency and content communicative skills, the program should offer professional development for lecturers not only in advanced discipline-specific pedagogy but also in language skills. An English certification policy could be implemented to set a proper standard for general English proficiency among lecturers. Also, workshops on cultural sensitivity and inclusive teaching strategies would help address the diversity issues, ensuring that all students, regardless of their linguistic or cultural backgrounds, feel supported. As Yuan (2020) suggested, language proficiency training alone is not adequate for EMI instruction. Cheng (2017) also noted three basic components for the successful delivery of specialized content in EMI classes, namely, English language skills, teaching effectiveness, and intercultural communication.

The positive impact of an immersive English environment highlights the need for program management to continuously promote and perhaps expand the use of English across all aspects of the university experience. This could involve more formal structured activities for both students and staff to use English outside the classroom. The findings also have implications for EAP pedagogy. Considering the current benefits of EAP courses, program management should continue to strengthen the relationship between content and EAP courses. This could involve providing training for EAP teachers on how to effectively link their teaching with specific content areas. Additionally, a collaborative platform for EAP and content lecturers could also be established to facilitate resource sharing and joint curriculum development.

# 5.2. Applications of the EMI-QE

The illustrative evaluation is only one of many ways to apply the EMI-QE in HE. One key strength of the EMI-QE is that it promotes inclusive and comprehensive evaluation focusing specifically on the EMI aspects of the program under evaluation. Its applications are wide-reaching as is Q evaluation. First, the EMI-QE can be used to assess the effectiveness of a specific intervention. That is, evaluators can use the EMI-QE to observe any potential changes before and after the intervention (e.g., instructional techniques, materials, technologies, and extracurricular activities) (see Morea, 2022). Second, in addition to the multiple-participant design demonstrated here, the EMI-QE can be used with an intensive single-case design, in which each participant completes the Q sort multiple times within a certain period (see Fraschini, 2023). This design allows evaluators to monitor the quality of the program in accordance with different events. Third, the EMI-QE can be adjusted to suit particular EMI contexts. The items can be expanded or shrunk to fit the purpose of the evaluation. In the case of involving other stakeholders as participants, the items must be tailored to ensure relevance for their specific roles. Fourth and finally, the EMI-QE can be used as a complementary tool to existing methods such as transitional surveys, which are predominantly used in EMI research (Graham & Eslami, 2019), and objective tests (e.g., language proficiency assessments), as called for by Macaro et al. (2018). That is, evaluators can validate the subjectivities against the quantitative data from surveys and objective tests.

# 6. Conclusion

This article introduces the EMI-QE as a novel means to evaluate EMI aspects of HE programs and offers step-by-step guidelines for its application. The EMI-QE was demonstrated with a computer science program, leading to the identification of several strengths and areas for improvement. The results offer useful information for program management regarding both effective practices and areas needing attention. The applications of the EMI-QE are wide-reaching, as it can be carried out with a variety of evaluation designs to fulfill different evaluation goals which vary from program to program. However, future users of the EMI-QE must bear in mind that its contribution lies in offering “contextual insights” to ensure that a particular EMI program meets its objectives and facilitates students’ success. We encourage adaptations of the tool for specific programs and specific objectives, and its use as an evaluation tool, whether as a standalone or complementary approach, to facilitate program improvement rather than as a research method that provides generalizable data.
