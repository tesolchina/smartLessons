# ABSTRACT

The development of corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP) is a complex and intriguing process that pertains to how corpus technology is directly applied to classroom teaching. Using a case study approach, this study investigated how two experienced university English teachers integrated corpus technology in authentic classroom teaching. Data sources included CBLP lesson materials, pre-interviews, lesson observations, and post-interviews. Our study detailed the process of how both teachers designed and implemented their CBLP teaching activities to address their student needs. The results indicate that the CBLP development draws on five components of teacher knowledge and practice: 1) knowledge of English language; 2) knowledge of corpus technology; 3) pedagogical knowledge; 4) contextual knowledge; and 5) learning and practice. Teacher learning and practice are integral and key to their CBLP development. Although the paths taken by each teacher shared some similarities and differences, both led to a relatively high level of CBLP growth after considerable learning and practice. Moreover, while one teacher developed the CBLP primarily from a strong knowledge of corpus technology, the other drew on solid pedagogical knowledge. A series of factors under each of the five components were also examined in relation to their influence on teacher paths to CBLP development. Based on the findings, several practical implications are provided to facilitate the process of developing CBLP for language teachers.

# 1.  Introduction

Over recent decades, numerous new language approaches mediated by technologies have emerged, broadly situated under computer-assisted language learning (CALL) technologies. However, one powerful CALL technology with a long history has been less successful in finding its way into language teachers’ classroom teaching—corpus technology. Corpus technology is closely related to (and has co-evolved with) corpus linguistics and traditionally refers to technology associated with corpus linguistics for identification of language patterns (Yoon, 2005). In our view, the term corpus technology is somewhat different from another well-known term Data-Driven Learning (DDL). Johns (1991) initiated the idea of using corpora to inform language learning and coined the term DDL. However, according to Boulton (2011), Johns did not provide a clear definition of DDL which has been evolving and encompassing many new ideas over time. Boulton defined DDL as ‘the hands-on use of authentic corpus data (concordances) by advanced, sophisticated foreign or second language learners in higher education for inductive, self-directed language learning of advanced usage’ (2011, p. 572). Here, the focus of DDL tends to be more on language learners’ self-exploration of corpora rather than teachers’ pedagogical application of corpora (even though this pedagogical purpose is not necessarily excluded). When referring to corpus technology, we emphasise its practical and pedagogical application and define it as the use and application of technology associated with corpus linguistics and corpora for language learning and teaching. Although corpus technology can embrace many technology types and applications, we focus on common tools/functions such as searching for concordance, keywords, frequency, and collocations embedded in popular corpus websites such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) (Davies, 2008), Lextutor (Cobb, 2002), Sketch Engine, and SKELL.

Compared to many old and new CALL technologies, corpus technology only has a marginal influence on classroom practice (Boulton, 2017; Callies, 2019; Chambers, 2019), because the majority of language teachers are reluctant to use it in classroom teaching (Breyer, 2009; Boulton, 2017; Chambers, 2019). Such a phenomenon is in sharp contrast with the overwhelmingly positive learning outcomes generated from empirical studies included in meta-analysis (Boulton & Cobb, 2017). Importantly, using corpus technology can help students improve various language skills, including vocabulary (Ackerley, 2017; Lee & Liou, 2003; Ma & Mei, 2021), collocations (Chan & Liou, 2005; Fang et al., 2021; Vyatkina, 2016), grammar (Lin & Lee, 2015; Smart, 2014), and writing (Yoon & Jo, 2014; Poole, 2016; Crosthwaite, 2020).

With respect to language teachers, their perceptions or attitudes towards integrating corpus technology into teaching have been well investigated (e.g. Breyer, 2009; Ebrahimi & Faghih, 2016; Abdel Latif, 2021; Leńko-Szymańska, 2014). Through corpus training, teachers could learn the basic knowledge of corpus technology, such as how to generate concordance lines by searching target linguistic items in the corpus and how to operate corpus tools such as AntConc (Breyer, 2009; Callies, 2019; Ebrahimi & Faghih, 2016; Abdel Latif, 2021; Leńko-Szymańska, 2014, 2017). In general, the results indicated that teachers have positive perceptions and attitudes towards the benefits of using corpus technology in language teaching. Although trainees can master some of the corpus technology skills (such as manipulating corpora and corpus tools), they still lack pedagogical skills to apply corpus technology in real language classrooms (Leńko-Szymańska, 2017). However, there is surprisingly little research on how teachers who are not corpus specialists develop their pedagogical knowledge and skills in applying corpus technology to their classroom teaching.

In this study, we investigated how two experienced in-service university English teachers (one with good corpus knowledge and the other with no such knowledge) blended corpus technology with language pedagogy to design, implement, and reflect on their corpus-based lessons to develop their corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP), a new concept expounded by Ma et  al. (2021). A case study approach was taken to portray the two teachers’ paths to their development of CBLP and to delineate the essential teacher knowledge required for CBLP development.

# 2.  Literature

# 2.1.  Corpora and language learning and teaching

Since the 1980s, corpora have been widely used in all areas of language studies and have greatly advanced our understanding of language use and patterns. Linguists and researchers soon discovered the advantages of using corpora in language teaching, notably through the efforts made by Johns (1991) in advocating his DDL approach. It is widely believed that language learners are capable of becoming ‘researchers’ or ‘detectors’ (Johns, 1991) when they engage in language learning from observing a large quantity of authentic corpus data, encouraging their discovery skills and inductive learning and enhancing their learning autonomy (Bernardini, 2002; Boulton & Cobb, 2017; Boulton, 2017; Chau, 2003; Lewandowska, 2014). Empirical research generally supports the effectiveness of using corpora for language development, as observed by Boulton (2010, p. 140): ‘The overall body of empirical research in DDL provides overwhelmingly favourable reactions to DDL on the part of learners’. For example, the study by Johns et  al. (2008) documented how 22 Chinese learners improved their English reading skills by using corpus data. Further, Boulton (2009) examined how 132 French university students made progress in learning English vocabulary after consulting corpus data. In the study by Charles (2011), 49 English as a Second Language (ESL) students self-perceived that they had increased their awareness and deepened their understanding of discourse features with the help of corpora. In particular, they experienced positive gains in higher-level discourse features after performing concordance work and learned specific lexicogrammatical expressions regarding different rhetorical functions in academic writing. In addition, an experimental study by Bardovi-Harlig et  al. (2015) demonstrated that corpora facilitated the learning of pragmatics for 37 ESL students. Here, the experimental groups outperformed the control group by providing more appropriate oral responses with the help of corpus-informed input.

Despite the encouraging evidence generated from experimental studies conducted by corpus linguists (or teacher-researchers), who are corpus specialists, the role of corpora in ordinary language teachers’ classroom teaching remains minimal (Boulton, 2017; Callies, 2019; Chambers, 2019). A common reason for this minimal role of corpus technology in classroom teaching is the various difficulties teachers encounter when using corpora, including technical issues, how to find suitable corpora, and a lack of time and confidence in using corpus technology (Leńko-Szymańska, 2017; Naismith, 2017; Poole, 2020; Zareva, 2017). Another important reason is that corpus training, especially regarding its pedagogical value, has received far too little attention in teacher education programmes (Boulton, 2017; Chambers, 2019; Callies, 2019). For example, Callies (2019) surveyed 26 in-service teachers’ knowledge of corpora, and the results indicated that over $8 0 \%$ had not received corpus training.

# 2.2.  CBLP: a corpus-based TPACK

Although increasing efforts have been made in recent years to offer corpus training for both pre- and in-service teachers, Ma et  al. (2021) argued that it remains unclear as to what knowledge requires developing to teach with corpora. To understand the essential knowledge needed in teacher training, they proposed and tested a two-dimension teacher knowledge framework termed corpus literacy and corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP) with 33 student teachers in a case study. Corpus literacy was defined by Mukherjee (2006), and reference was made to teachers’ ability to understand and search corpora, analyse the search results, and know the limitations and benefits of corpora use in language learning. CBLP builds on corpus literacy and is ‘the ability to integrate corpus linguistics technology into classroom language pedagogy to facilitate language teaching’ (Ma et  al., 2021, p. 2).

Following Meunier (2019) and applying the broad TPACK framework proposed by Koehler and Mishra (2009), CBLP can be considered a core competence that influences two factors: the extent to which teachers use corpus technology and how they use it to implement teaching methods for teaching language subjects. The concept of TPACK was evolved from Shulman’s (1986, 1987) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), which refers to ‘special amalgam of content and pedagogy that is uniquely the province of teachers, their own special form of professional understanding’ (Shulman, 1987, p. 8). Moreover, if TPACK can be considered to integrate technology with PCK, then CBLP blends knowledge from corpus technology and language-specific PCK. A simple graphical representation of the relationships between PCK, TPACK, and CBLP is presented in Figure 1.

Shulman’s PCK framework has been applied to study teachers’ professional development, including English language teachers. It demonstrates that teachers’ lack of epistemic knowledge often leads them to the misunderstanding that content knowledge or subject knowledge are sufficient for attaining their teacher competencies. For example, Atay et  al. (2010) conducted a qualitative study and observed the development of 18 student English teachers in Turkey. The results indicated that most of the participants were incapable of combining content knowledge with pedagogical knowledge (i.e. PCK). Similarly, Worden (2018) adopted a case study approach to examine four novice teachers of English writing in the United States, and similar results were obtained. Extending PCK to TPACK, the study by Crosthwaite et  al. (2021) contributed to the application of corpus technology to language teaching for student teachers, where their ability to teach with corpora was measured within a TPACK framework. In the study, they observed the development of TPACK specific to corpus technology of nine student English teachers in Indonesia. The results indicated that the student teachers were able to design relevant corpus-based teaching materials, but some of them lacked the instructional strategies to integrate corpus technology into classroom to meet the lesson objectives. In our paper, we will show how two in-service teachers designed and instructed their corpus-based lesson to meet the lesson objectives.

# 2.3.  Teacher development of CBLP

To date, empirical studies on teacher development of CBLP have been scarce and narrowly focused on in- or pre-service teachers’ perceptions or attitudes toward their future use of corpora in teaching upon receiving corpus training (Breyer, 2009; Ebrahimi & Faghih, 2016; Farr, 2008; Abdel Latif, 2021; Leńko-Szymańska, 2014; Naismith, 2017; Zareva, 2017). Some pre-service teachers have been required to design corpus-based teaching materials (Heather & Helt, 2012; Leńko-Szymańska, 2017). Although the study by Heather and Helt (2012) collected interesting lesson materials designed by six student teachers, the analysis focused on identifying relevant elements to measure participant corpus literacy with a limited focus on their pedagogical skills in designing appropriate teaching materials. By comparison, Leńko-Szymańska (2017) conducted a detailed analysis of 53 sets of lesson materials by student teachers and evaluated their pedagogical skills of designing lessons. The results indicated that student teachers lacked ‘pedagogical skills that are necessary for successful exploitation of corpora in language education’ (p. 217). In general, these pre-service teachers were not required to carry out corpus-based teaching. However, without actual practice, their development of CBLP would be severely hindered.

Typically, in-service teachers expressed favourable attitudes and an intention to adopt CBLP after receiving corpus training (Chen et  al., 2019; Ebrahimi & Faghih, 2016; Abdel Latif, 2021). However, very few teachers made any effort to implement CBLP in their classroom teaching. The main reasons include perceived complexity of corpus technology, a lack of time or a mismatch with their school curriculums. In summation, there is almost no opportunity to observe in-service teachers’ practice of CBLP in classroom. There was only one exception to this situation, where Lin (2019) explored how one early-career teacher learned to use corpus technology and designed, implemented, and reflected on his CBLP in a university English language class. The results demonstrated that hands-on practice of CBLP can make a unique contribution to a teacher’s CBLP development. Moreover, this process could be ‘complex, radical’, involving ‘continuous series of transformations’ of becoming a teacher who can teach with corpora (Lin, 2019, p. 70).

Ma et  al. (2021) adopted Shulman’s (1987) model of pedagogical reasoning to investigate how a group of pre-service teachers developed their CBLP. The model examines teachers’ pedagogical reasoning for developing PCK to handle teaching and identifies five essential stages. The first is comprehension of subject knowledge and teaching purposes and the second is transformation, meaning how to transfer comprehended ideas to teach appropriately. Instruction is the third stage, which includes how to conduct actual classroom teaching and how to sequence and manage student learning. The final two stages (evaluation and reflection) involve teachers self-evaluating and reflecting on the outcomes of their practices. The results of Ma et  al. (2021) are encouraging, demonstrating that student teachers are able to design appropriate CBLP lessons, identify a suitable language focus for their target students, attempt to address target students’ learning difficulties, and include rich resources and interactive learning activities. Similar to most pre-service teachers, these student teachers did not have any opportunity to teach their CBLP lessons. Therefore, only the first two stages of comprehension and transformation were examined in their study, leaving the sizable gap of completing the remaining three stages of the pedagogical reasoning process.

# 2.4.  Ways forward and research questions

The aim of this study is to close the loop by examining the paths of two experienced English teachers when developing their CBLP by integrating corpus technology with their pedagogical reasoning into their teaching practice. Following Ma et  al. (2021), originally designed for understanding PCK (see above), Shulman’s pedagogical reasoning model (1987) has been used for investigating TPACK (Harris & Phillips, 2018; Holmberg et  al., 2018). In accordance with Holmberg et  al. (2018), the term pedagogical reasoning within TPACK refers to the integrated processes in which teachers learn, apply, and reflect on different aspects of their professional knowledge and practice with the use of various educational technologies. Specifically, teachers’ TPACK development is closely related to their pedagogical reasoning, which can be viewed as ‘a continuous process of iterative reflective professional conversations with design situations, where ICT is used for added pedagogical value and the ‘necessary’ specific practical TPACK is manifested and elaborated on in situ’ (Holmberg et  al., 2018, p. 139). Since CBLP is a specific TPACK that is unique to corpus technology, pedagogical reasoning should also be suitable for investigating teachers’ CBLP development. As there is a lack of CBLP research involving experienced in-service teachers, the results of our study may help to determine the pedagogical suitability, practicality, and feasibility of implementing CBLP in classroom settings for experienced English teachers. In essence, our study complements the work of Lin (2019) with respect to a novice teacher’s development of CBLP.

We portray the possible paths taken by two teachers from different backgrounds and educational contexts when developing CBLP, and we reveal the essential knowledge required for their learning journeys. This could provide additional evidence for examining the effectiveness of corpus-based teaching in authentic classrooms, compared to the widely documented corpus-based teaching in experimental settings. Furthermore, by investigating the factors that influence experienced teachers’ development of CBLP in real classroom settings, this will provide useful suggestions for corpus educators to develop sound technological and pedagogical skills in trainees, which are necessary for practical applications of corpus technology in classroom teaching. Ultimately, this may shed light on designing effective future teacher corpus-based training programmes.

Therefore, to investigate how the two experienced teachers develop their CBLP and understand the factors contributing to the development of CBLP, our research aims to address the following questions:

How did the two teachers develop their CBLP in their classroom teaching? What factors influenced their development of CBLP?

# 3.  Method

# 3.1.  Background

To help teachers develop CBLP, three online corpus workshops (each lasting 2 hours) were conducted by the first author at a university in Hong Kong between April and May 2020. The target participants were primarily Hong Kong or mainland Chinese English teachers $( \mathrm { n } = 5 0 )$ ). During the first three weeks, the participants attended one workshop per week on topics including an introduction to corpora, how to conduct corpus searches, and how to design CBLP lessons. In the fourth week, they were asked to design a CBLP lesson and upload it to an online platform (Schoology) for sharing, commenting, and revision. In the final step, the participants were invited to teach their CBLP lesson in a classroom setting. Since the lesson design and teaching were voluntary, only 15 teachers (out of 50) designed lesson plans, of which two agreed to participate in our research study and completed the final step of teaching (one in July and one in October). These two teachers constituted the participants in this case study, and the whole research process was spread over six months (from April to October).

# 3.2.  Participants and context

The two teacher participants were called Tim and May (pseudonyms), and both had rich tertiary teaching experience. Informed written consent was obtained from both teachers. The two teachers were selected for the present study for the following reasons. First, although 15 teachers designed their CBLP lessons, only Tim and May volunteered to implement their lessons in a real classroom setting. Second, the two teachers had widely different backgrounds and educational contexts: Tim taught science students and May English majors; one focused on writing (grammar) and the other reading (discourse); Tim has great familiarity while May has no knowledge of corpora; Tim adopted online teaching while May conducted classroom teaching when implementing CBLP lessons. We believe that these two different cases represent several interesting authentic scenarios in which language teachers are likely to find themselves.

Tim was awarded a doctoral degree in linguistics and taught English for 10 years at the tertiary level. He used to teach associate, bachelor, and MA degree students. At the time of the study, he was teaching academic writing and generic English skills to non-language students at a community college in Hong Kong. In the actual corpus-based teaching, 22 final-year science students attended his 160-minute lecture, which focused on appropriate sentence patterns in academic writing. Although face-to-face teaching was originally planned, an online teaching mode was eventually adopted due to various practical constraints that arose during the pandemic.

May was awarded an MA degree in English literature and taught English for 15 years at the tertiary level. She was working at a university in a provincial capital city in mainland China, and her teaching focused on critical reading skills for English majors. She implemented her corpus-based teaching to 48 second-year English majors in a 90-minute lecture on discourse features of political speech texts in a face-to-face teaching mode.

# 3.3.  Analytical framework

We adapted Shulman’s (1987) five stages of the model of pedagogical reasoning as our analytical framework (comprehension, transformation, instruction, evaluation, and reflection) to provide a holistic visualisation of the entire process of teachers developing their CBLP. Since we focused on one specific type of TPACK, i.e. CBLP, we adapted what should be included in each stage. Specifically, comprehension in this study refers to teachers’ understanding of the teaching purpose, content, and the students. This stage also includes what corpus technology should be selected and what learning objectives should be set. Transformation is the process of how teachers prepare and design lesson materials by integrating the corpus technology, organising teaching activities and designing interaction modes. Instruction refers to classroom instructional strategies (including motivating strategies) and the provision of guidance to help students explore corpora. Evaluation refers to teachers’ self-evaluation of their designed corpus-based materials and their teaching practice, while reflection represents their self-reflection of the whole process of participating in our project.

# 3.4.  Data collection and procedure

Four types of data were collected: (1) corpus-based lesson materials designed by the two teachers, (2) a pre-interview (before classroom teaching) focusing on how they designed the lesson materials, (3) lesson observations (recorded video of classroom teaching and observation notes taken during the observation), and (4) a post-interview (after classroom teaching) focusing on teachers’ instruction, evaluation, and reflection of their teaching.

A sample of corpus-based lesson materials was provided to Tim and May, including the target level of students, corpus used, lesson duration and objectives, and step-by-step teaching activities (work sheets). The lesson materials designed by both teachers included these components; in addition, they also included the rationale and teaching steps to justify their design of the teaching activities.

A pre-interview guideline (see Appendix 1a) was designed by adapting Shulman’s (1987) first two stages: comprehension and transformation (see above). The interview was conducted after receiving each participant’s CBLP lesson materials. Similarly, a guideline was developed for the post-interview (see Appendix 1 b), which was conducted after the completion of each teacher’s CBLP lesson, focusing on Shulman’s (1987) last three stages: instruction, evaluation and reflection (see above). The pre- and post-interview questions were both piloted and finalised (with minor revisions) before being used with Tim and May. Each interview lasted approximately 60 minutes and was conducted in the mother tongue of each teacher (Cantonese for Tim and Mandarin for May). All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A lesson observation scheme (see Appendix 2) was developed to keep notes during the classroom observation. Both lessons were video recorded, and one trained research assistant recorded notes using the observation scheme.

# 3.5.  Data analysis

All data from the four resources were read, understood, and coded by the first author following a qualitative approach (Yin, 2009). First, the interview transcripts and documents were carefully reviewed to identify any knowledge developed and applied by the participants to enact CBLP in their lesson design and classroom teaching. Thematic analysis was performed, revealing different domain knowledge (such as knowledge of English language and contextual knowledge) which contributed to their CBLP development. Second, the data were further examined to reveal the path of knowledge construction experienced by the participants. Specifically, the researcher produced an analytical memo for each participant to document how CBLP was actualised through comprehension, transformation, instruction, evaluation, and reflection (if any) in authentic language classrooms. For instance, the participants demonstrated comprehension about their teaching objectives and their own students, which served as a critical step for the transformation and implementation of their CBLP. Third, a cross-case comparison (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019) was conducted to examine the similarities and differences between the two cases and to identify the influencing factors behind their knowledge development (including participant motivation and contextual support). Fourth, while the first author coded the data, another researcher was invited to replicate the work independently using the same coding approach. The two researchers then exchanged their data analysis results (in terms of identified codes and themes) and any disputes were resolved through discussion.

Finally, respondent validation through member checking (Miles et  al., 2020) was conducted in the study. Findings for each case were presented to the teacher concerned, who was then invited to correct misinterpretations, provide additional information, and comment on the appropriateness and adequacy of the data analysis. Minor adjustments were made to the data after member checking.

# 4.  Findings

The findings are organised according to each case and centre around the five stages outlined previously.

# 4.1.  Tim: functional linguist and lover of corpus technology

Before participating in this project, as a functional linguist, Tim was familiar with various corpus websites and tools, including COCA, British National Corpus (BNC), WMatrix, and WordSmith. He conducted his master’s thesis using a corpus linguistic approach, completed a PhD in functional linguistics, and was keen to adopt a genre-based pedagogy to teach writing. He regularly used corpus technology for learning and research purposes. At work, he often discussed the use of corpus technology with his colleagues, which was ‘pleasant and enjoyable’ (Pre-interview, Tim). However, Tim had not used any corpus technology for teaching purposes prior to the present study. This motivated him to attend our CBLP workshops and learn how to design a CBLP lesson plan to receive peer feedback, before applying the plan in a classroom setting. Accordingly, Tim’s learning about CBLP primarily focused on the pedagogical aspects (i.e. how to integrate corpus technology into classroom teaching).

# 4.1.1.  Comprehension

Tim’s students were generally weak in terms of English skills, exhibiting relatively poor performance (C grades). Moreover, his students were ‘less motivated’ and ‘weak in grammar’. Tim decided to help his students to improve grammar with corpus technology in his lecture on academic writing. Therefore, his lesson design was guided by three objectives: (1) help students to discover their own grammar mistakes, (2) help them to express evaluative statement constructions by using authentic examples from corpora (e.g. sentence patterns) in academic writing, and (3) show them how to use corpora as a self-learning tool for improving grammar. In general, Tim demonstrated a good understanding of his students and their learning problems and he endeavoured to address these problems with the use of corpus technology. This contextual knowledge of his students and their learning problems formed the foundation of the CBLP lesson that Tim designed.

# 4.1.2.  Transformation

Tim selected COCA when teaching this academic writing lecture. COCA is a one-billion-word corpus of contemporary American English complied by Davies (2008). Tim focused on two grammatical patterns: a) Noun $^ +$ find it $^ +$ adjective and b) It + linking verb $^ +$ adjective (Hunston & Francis, 2000). By exploring these two sentence patterns, students were expected to learn a variety of adjectives (including ‘easy’, ‘important’, ‘obvious’, ‘possible’, and ‘wise’) with regard to expressing evaluations of some facts or phenomena that may occur in academic writing. Tim explained the rationale of this lesson design in his teaching plan:

The instruction design of the present lesson is informed by a genre-based pedagogy (GBP), based on a functional linguistic approach (e.g. Martin & Rothery, 1986; Polias & Forey, 2016). In GBP, the explicit teaching of knowledge about language required for writing in the target genre [academic writing] is emphasised, complete with the use of text exemplars. The exemplar is deconstructed and broken down into ‘stages’—how meaning is sequenced to achieve a particular rhetorical purpose, such as describing, reporting, classifying, explaining, or arguing (or a combination of such). Hence, this deconstruction process equips students with linguistic resources for constructing their own texts under the teacher’s guidance.

(Lesson Design, Tim)

Tim’s self-explanation demonstrated his high-level mastery of English (language subject knowledge) and its textual features. Aligned with this design rationale, Tim’s teaching was divided into three steps: (1) setting the context (showing the problematic use in students’ writing); (2) deconstruction (identifying the problematic use and searching in COCA for the correct use); (3) joint and independent construction (reviewing the target sentence patterns with the help of corpus searches). His teaching activities and steps were also aligned with the teaching objectives of helping students to learn grammar patterns pertinent to academic writing from a genre-based approach. This demonstrated his solid corpus technology and good theoretical pedagogical knowledge, especially when designing CBLP lesson materials. A summary of the actual teaching steps and activities is provided in Appendix 3a.

# 4.1.3.  Instruction

In a preceding lesson (and during the lecture), Tim demonstrated how to perform some search functions (e.g. ‘collocates’ and ‘compare’ functions) to motivate and help his students to use COCA. The target lesson was delivered in a synchronous online setting via Microsoft Teams (a teleconferencing program). During the lesson, Tim asked the students to finish the activities by conducting corpus searches directly with COCA. Although Tim included some pair work in his lesson plan, a lecture-dominated approach comprising teacher demonstration and individual student work was mainly observed during the lesson. This was partly due to the shift to online teaching, and Tim explained how he adapted to this: ‘After switching to online teaching, the interaction mode was different from that of face-to-face teaching. I tried to use Google Docs and Socrative to conduct whole-class sharing to engage my students’ (Post-interview, Tim). This indicates that to fully utilise corpus technology in a synchronous online teaching environment, the teacher should adopt other relevant online technologies to facilitate communication and interaction with students.

The lesson observation revealed that the class encountered various technical problems that potentially hindered the students’ application of corpus technology in their language learning tasks. The main issues included: 1) overly complex operation of COCA, despite its comprehensive functionalities, 2) licencing issues that potentially slowed the processes for operating the corpus tool, such as lengthy wait times and intermittent advertising messages. These technical difficulties may have somewhat discouraged the students from participating fully in all learning activities. It was also observed that students were less willing to answer questions in the second half of the lecture after they started searching on COCA. It was recorded that only three students answered the teacher’s questions towards the end of the lecture. These technical problems were unexpected since Tim is an experienced COCA user; however, he may have somewhat ignored the licensing issue when using COCA in his students’ first trial of corpus learning.

# 4.1.4.  Evaluation

Based on in-class participation and feedback from 1 student evaluations, Tim self-rated his lesson as 6 to 7 out of 10. Since his students were in their final year and would be graduating soon, he thought that some students had expected him to teach them more practical knowledge (e.g. how to pass exams). Accordingly, they were less motivated to explore more advanced learning content or tools (such as corpora). Despite this disadvantage, Tim self-rated corpora as 8 to 9 out of 10 in terms of being a useful tool to help students learn English.

Tim recalled that some peer teachers had provided useful suggestions for improving the design of his CBLP lesson. Accordingly, he considered peer suggestions ‘very helpful and constructive’ and ‘peer review assesses my ability to integrate corpus use in classroom teaching’ (Post-Interview, Tim).

# 4.1.5.  Reflection

As an experienced corpus user, the main advantage for Tim participating in our project was to learn how to design a lesson using corpus tools. His CBLP learning drew on various knowledge sources, including solid language subject knowledge, proficient use of corpus technology, pedagogical knowledge, and contextual knowledge (e.g.understanding the students and the teaching context). In addition, he engaged in professional teacher practice by learning and practicing how to integrate corpus technology when designing teaching materials and instructing the CBLP lesson (with a certain level of success). Accordingly, he demonstrated new learning and was convinced that corpus technology can help teachers look for language evidence to inform language teaching.

We language teachers are confident about our language ability, but we may know less how to explain the language rules and patterns to students and we mainly rely on our intuition. Now corpus tools help teachers with evidence-based teaching. (Post-interview, Tim)

Tim also reflected on the constraints of integrating corpus technology into classroom teaching, based on the technical difficulties encountered by his students. Access to free corpora was raised as a critical issue. Without a license, his students sometimes needed to wait for 2 minutes (or more) for each search conducted on COCA, which slowed down the teaching process considerably. In addition, Tim acknowledged that it was somewhat difficult to control and monitor student learning when delivering an online CBLP lesson for the first time. However, he expected that situation to improve with more experience of conducting online CBLP lessons.

Finally, Tim believed participating in our project enhanced significantly his professional development. Specifically, he started to reflect on his research and teaching interests: ‘I’m considering writing a proposal to integrate corpora into classroom teaching’ (Post-interview, Tim). In addition to EAP and discourse analysis, he was now interested in corpus linguistics and even considered compiling a learner corpus for teaching EAP courses.

# 4.2.  May: a curriculum reformer and experimenter of new pedagogy

May started with no knowledge of corpus technology when participating in our project. She learned about corpus technology from our workshop training and self-directed reading. For example, she learned how to use AntConc for conducting keyword analyses by reading literature and manuals. AntConc is a freeware corpus toolkit for textual analysis developed by Anthony (2005). Accordingly, May’s learning about CBLP constitutes both corpus technology and how it could be integrated into her classroom teaching (pedagogical knowledge). May enjoyed challenges and tried to change her course curriculum every year. She was currently taking part in a large project at her university to reform the teaching curriculum and methods. She also aspired to integrate her teaching with research, as she believed the two could be mutually beneficial. In this sense, participating in our project represented one of her endeavours to reform the curriculum and teaching methods.

# 4.2.1.  Comprehension

May’s students were second-year English majors. They were heavily influenced by exam-oriented learning (inherited from secondary school), accustomed to teacher-centred teaching, and lacked independent learning strategies. Accordingly, May envisioned the challenge as designing a critical reading lesson with the aim of ‘changing their learning habits’ using corpus technology (Pre-interview, May). Similar to Tim, May also demonstrated a good understanding of her students and the problems they face (contextual understanding). Her lesson objectives included the following: 1) conduct discourse analysis and study rhetorical strategies (e.g. religious colour) in a political speech; 2) analyse lexical features of pronouns used in the speech; 3) raise student intercultural communication awareness; 4) use a corpus tool for discourse analysis and inductive and autonomous learning. The first three objectives are related to targeting the linguistic skill of her lesson, which was the discourse of political speech. The content of these objectives suggested that May has good command of discourse features in English (language subject knowledge). The final objective is directly related to CBLP, which is what May aimed to achieve by participating in our project.

# 4.2.2.  Transformation

With a focus on critical reading and discourse features, she compiled a corpus containing 99 speeches made by celebrities as a reference corpus to be compared to the target political speech through AntConc. She also selected two online videos (TED speech) in her lesson, as she believed that videos are good language learning materials.

She used student feedback from their homework on similar topics to improve her design of this lesson. Prior to this lesson, students had learned some discourse features about speech. Now, she intended to use a new tool (corpus technology) to help them review and reinforce what they had learned. Similar to Tim, May also integrated other relevant language pedagogy (i.e. educational dialogues) into her corpus-based lesson. However, her focus was on creating an interactive learning environment for students, which was less apparent in Tim’s teaching.

Based on the four dialogues raised by Burbules (1993), i.e. dialogue as conversation, dialogue as inquiry, dialogue as debate and dialogue as instruction, I tried to include teacher-to-student and student-to-student interactions in designing each learning activity.

(Lesson Design, May)

May started with no knowledge (before receiving our corpus training) and strived hard to develop her comprehension of corpus technology by learning, reading, self-instruction, and integrating her favourite learning resources (videos) when designing the CBLP lesson. May’s actions matched her teaching character: she enjoyed challenges and was keen to explore new pedagogy. Her lesson design demonstrated advanced pedagogical knowledge, especially when she integrated various sources when designing corpus-based teaching materials. This approach is recommended by Ma et  al. (2021), where non-corpus resources should be integrated with corpus resources when designing CBLP materials. A summary of her actual teaching steps and activities is provided in Appendix 3b.

# 4.2.3.  Instruction

Before the lesson, May sent the self-compiled corpus to her students together with three short self-made videos on how to download, install, and search in AntConc. As a new learner of corpus technology, she foresaw the complexities involved in learning about corpus technology. This was in contrast to Tim, who is an experienced corpus technology user. He somewhat neglected the technical problems his students (as new users) might encounter. When delivering the lesson in a computer lab, May frequently used questioning to guide students when studying particular concordance lines to answer quiz questions. Because of her full preparation and clear demonstration, students rarely encountered technical difficulties when using AntConc during the lesson.

The lesson was conducted smoothly, and various interaction modes were observed, including individual work (hands-on corpus searches), pair work (students searching collaboratively to answer the teacher’s questions), group work (student critical discussion), and whole-class work (students answering some quiz questions). In particular, all students were involved in the group discussion for critical reading, contributing their views and engaging in heated discussion. As shown in Ma (2020), peer feedback can boost students’ learning interest and improve their learning outcomes. Once again, this attested to May’s strong pedagogical knowledge, especially in creating a student-centred and interactive learning environment.

# 4.2.4.  Evaluation

May was greatly encouraged by the positive 2 evaluations from her students. Similar to Tim, she highly commended the advantages of corpora for enhancing student language learning:

This is students’ first taste of using corpus. Now they know that they could search for collocates, study concordance lines, and try to summarise the meanings. They may gradually master how to conduct inductive learning with corpus technology (Post-interview, May).

# 4.2.5.  Reflection

Akin to Tim, the main advantage for May was gaining important learning from participating in our project. Now she understood it was important to (1) combine language teaching with critical thinking and (2) contextualise language teaching with the use of corpus technology. She also enjoyed the process of designing the CBLP lesson and concurred that peer suggestions were helpful for offering different perspectives to enhance her self-learning and reflection. For example, May was alerted to the importance of using a reference corpus in her lesson design after reading a peer comment. Peers also reminded her to provide clear guidance for students when conducting CBLP teaching. May’s learning and practice of corpus technology and CBLP were built on several knowledge sources: good language subject knowledge (on political speeches), interactive and student-centred pedagogy, and a clear understanding of students’ weaknesses and learning needs (contextual knowledge). Despite a baseline of having no knowledge of corpus technology, she managed to develop quickly adequate knowledge and skills about corpus technology to experiment with her CBLP classroom pedagogy.

May highlighted two limitations of using corpus technology in teaching. The first concerns how to select appropriate corpus tools based on teaching objectives:

I teach discourse, so I selected AntConc because it has the 3 KWIC [Key Word in Context] function that could help me achieve my teaching objectives. But how to select appropriate corpus to be aligned to teachers’ teaching objectives in their daily teaching will be challenging.

(Post-interview, May)

The second limitation was related to motivating students and activating their interest in using corpus technology, because ‘they may be lazy or passive to avoid trying out new technologies’ (Post-interview, May). May believed that teachers should encourage students to step outside their comfort zone and experience new learning with corpus technology.

Our project also provided significant assistance with May’s professional development, with her admitting: ‘My corpus literacy was nil, now I have rebuilt my knowledge system about language teaching’ (Post-interview, May). As her ultimate aim is to combine teaching with research, she was highly motivated to conduct CBLP-related research by using corpus technology. In addition, she fully recognised the importance of learning from peers and suggested creating a teacher learning community for mutual assistance with teaching and research.

# 5.  Discussion and implications

# 5.1.  Paths to CBLP development

The key themes emerging from the data analysis (see italics above) indicated that five components of teacher knowledge and teacher practice can influence teachers’ CBLP development: 1) knowledge of language subject; 2) knowledge of corpus technology; 3) pedagogical knowledge; 4) contextual knowledge; and 5) learning and practice. As a specific type of TPACK, CBLP draws on subject knowledge (i.e. language subject) as well as corpus technology. The third component is pedagogical knowledge, which in our study refers specifically to language pedagogical knowledge.

The fourth refers to teacher knowledge of the educational context at both the macro and micro levels. The micro level includes knowledge about the students—their language ability, learning habits, and difficulties (explicit in our data). The macro level can include knowledge about teaching curricula and school policy (implicit in our data). The component of learning and practice is similar to the concept ‘domain of practice’ raised by Clarke and Hollingsworth (2002). However, we included both learning and practice. As demonstrated in our study, learning was an integral process of teacher practice through reading literature (for May) (see also Dirk et  al., 2017; Lin, 2019), through consulting and discussing with peers (for Tim and May) (see also Donnelly & Hume, 2015), and through reflection after the practice (for Tim and May) (see also Shulman & Shulman, 2004; Worden, 2018). Our data suggest that teacher learning and practice are integral and mutually beneficial.

In the current study, both teachers demonstrated a relatively high level of CBLP development. They designed an appropriate corpus-based lesson, implemented it into real classroom teaching, and achieved varied levels of success. As suggested by Magnusson et  al. (1999, p. 22), different domains of teacher knowledge can ‘unequally influence the development of pedagogical content knowledge due to differences in the amount of knowledge in each domain’. Our data indicated that both teachers have good levels of English (language subject) and contextual knowledge (e.g. understanding their students’ weaknesses and learning strategies/habits). Moreover, as experienced teachers, both designed and implemented their lessons and exhibited a deep level of reflection (learning and practice), drawing on their knowledge of English, educational contexts, and learning and practice. However, there were two main differences between the two: knowledge of corpus technology and pedagogical knowledge.

Tim is a passionate user of corpus technology for learning and research purposes. After participating in our project, Tim demonstrated his theoretical pedagogical knowledge in designing the CBLP lesson, recognised the teaching value of corpus technology and added this new knowledge to his language teaching pedagogy. However, he might possess slightly less practical pedagogical knowledge than May: he had shorter teaching experience (10 years) than May (15 years) and primarily used a lecturer-dominated approach in his lesson. Figure 2 represents Tim’s path to CBLP. Following Magnusson et  al. (1999), the size of the box represents the amount of knowledge in a particular domain, and the thickness of the lines linking the domains indicates to what extent they could influence each other. As shown in the figure, Tim’s domain of pedagogical knowledge was slightly smaller than the other four. Accordingly, his CBLP was mainly influenced by his knowledge in the other four domains, especially his substantial knowledge of corpus technology.

![](img/1e82cd666d918a86b83a79939b4c40ee56395fb398a353107eb229c1a0d4e912.jpg)  
Figure 2. T im’s path to CBLP.

By contrast, May started with no knowledge of corpus technology. However, through our workshop training and self-learning, she developed some essential knowledge and skills for corpus technology and even managed to instruct herself on how to use a new corpus tool (AntConc) that was not introduced in our training. She also successfully conducted her CBLP lesson by integrating non-corpus resources (e.g. videos) and creating an interactive learning environment for her students, which was warmly and positively received by her students. In addition, May enjoys challenges (such as constantly reforming her curriculum and exploring new teaching approaches), so it is reasonable to assume that she possessed slightly more sophisticated pedagogical knowledge compared to Tim. May’s path to developing her CBLP is shown in Figure 3. May had a smaller amount of knowledge of corpus technology, and her CBLP was primarily influenced by her knowledge in the other four components, especially her advanced pedagogical knowledge.

Our study indicated that teachers may start with proficient or no knowledge of corpus technology when receiving corpus training. As a functional linguist and lover of corpora, Tim’s advanced knowledge of corpus technology may not necessarily lead to a more successful implementation of CBLP in classroom teaching. As a curriculum reformer and experimenter of new pedagogy, May began with little knowledge of corpus technology, but her advanced pedagogical knowledge may have helped compensate her inadequacy in corpus technology. With her self-learning and support from peers, she implemented a successful CBLP lesson.

# 5.2.  Factors influencing teacher paths to CBLP development

Through our data analysis, we identified five key components pertinent to CBLP development. Since having solid language subject knowledge is a prerequisite for teaching any language, we mainly focus on the remaining four by examining some salient factors under each that influenced the teacher paths to CBLP development.

![](img/3b0cda6d43eec49d891b913848fc21aef6ec0290058e3fcf6d725ccadb7ca586.jpg)  
Figure 3. M ay’s path to CBLP.

# 5.2.1.  Knowledge of corpus technology

Helping students overcome technical difficulty regarding corpus technology. While Tim was an experienced user of corpus technology, he failed to consider the technical problems his students (as new user of corpus technology) might encounter during the lecture. By contrast, despite little knowledge of corpus technology, May strived to master some essential knowledge and skills of corpus technology introduced in our workshop training and continued by exploring a new corpus tool in her CBLP teaching. After experiencing using the corpus tool as a learner (Breyer, 2009), she was aware of any possible technical problems the students could encounter. Therefore, she prepared in advance to minimise the influence of any technical difficulties. Regardless of the baseline knowledge of corpus technology, to foresee and help students overcome the technical difficulties inherent with corpus technology is a key question that teachers should consider when integrating it into classroom teaching. This also resonates with the finding by Lin (2019) that teacher concerns with technical problems related to corpus technology is a challenging issue to be resolved.

Free access to corpora. As shown in this study, free access to corpora is another essential factor that may influence the teacher when deciding whether to integrate corpus technology into classroom teaching. Although COCA has recently been revamped to become more user-friendly, it is still a commercial website, and buying licenses and registrations are mandated for its full access. Without a license, partial access with limited search functions and slow speed are considered troublesome, discouraging both teachers and students from using corpus technology.

Combining corpus technology with other online technologies. Due to the pandemic, online teaching has frequently been adopted in education, especially at universities. As noted by Tim, teachers need to change their teaching strategies to cater for online teaching. This suggests that in addition to introducing corpus technology to teachers, we may help teachers learn about useful online technologies to enable them to deliver online CBLP teaching more effectively. For example, teachers could learn how to use alternative online technologies (e.g. Socrative, Nearpod, or Padlet) to support their usual teaching platforms (e.g. Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Blackboard).

These suggest that training in corpus technology for teachers should focus on those free and easily-accessible online corpora and help teachers/students solve possible technical difficulties involved in using corpus technology. In addition, some complimentary online technologies can be introduced to augment teachers’ integration of corpus technology into their teaching.

# 5.2.2.  Pedagogical knowledge

Integrating topic-specific theories in CBLP design. In developing teacher CBLP, it is important for teachers to use relevant theories to inform the design of corpus-based lessons. For example, both Tim and May incorporated topic-specific theories in designing their academic writing and political speech lessons, respectively: a genre-based writing pedagogy (Martin & Rothery, 1986) and educational dialogues (Burbules, 1993). Lin and Lee (2015) also suggest that corpus-based teaching should be combined with other teaching approaches (such as including grammar-translation methods when teaching grammar). Corpus technology, like any language technology, is only a tool; what makes student learning meaningful and effective lies in the teacher’s pedagogical design.

Adopting interactive and student-centred activities in CBLP lessons. The two lessons received different student evaluations after implementation. Apparently, Tim was disappointed by the somewhat passive classroom participation and lack of enthusiasm towards corpus learning displayed by his students (which might have been partially due to the adopted online teaching mode). By contrast, May’s students responded to her teaching and the introduction of corpus technology with great passion. The interactive learning with student full participation observed in May’s lesson is an important factor to account for the success of her lesson. How to design interactive corpus-based learning activities is a good indicator of a teacher’s ability to design CBLP lessons (Ma et  al., 2021). These imply that, to design effective CBLP lessons, teachers should be encouraged to integrate a variety of learning activities informed by other relevant language pedagogies/theories and try to create interactive and student-centred learning environments in empowering student learning, in addition to use of corpus resources and tools.

# 5.2.3.  Contextual knowledge

Understanding student needs and motivating their use of corpus technology. When designing CBLP lessons, in addition to curriculum knowledge, teachers should know well their students, including their language proficiency, learning strategies/habits, and weaknesses and difficulties. Both Tim and May fully considered these factors when designing their lesson with appropriate learning objectives. Compared to May’s students who were still fresh (Year 2) and motivating in learning, Tim perceived his final year students to be somewhat demotivated ‘veterans’ towards academic language learning, since they would soon be entering the workplace. In such situations, how to motivate students to learn with new technology (e.g. corpus technology) is an important factor that teachers should consider when implementing CBLP lessons.

It is suggested that, in addition to identification of student academic learning needs, how to address their practical needs, i.e. using English at workplace in Tim’s case, should be considered to motivate students to explore corpus technology when conducting CBLP teaching. It is student reactions and feedback that can affirm teachers’ belief and continued efforts in developing their CBLP.

# 5.2.4.  Learning and practice

Self-learning and peer support aiding teacher development. Practice and learning are the most direct methods of helping teachers to develop any pedagogy including CBLP. In our study, learning (attending our workshop training and reflection) and practice (designing and implementing the CBLP lesson) were repeated by both teachers during the entire process of participating in our project. This suggests that learning became an integral part of the practice of designing, implementing, and evaluating their CBLP lessons. Notably, both Tim and May enhanced their learning of CBLP through peer support in the form of suggestions and discussions. Further, engaging teachers in collaborative learning could expand their teaching resources/ideas and result in them reviewing teaching techniques (Donnelly & Hume, 2015). Peer feedback also encouraged Tim and May to self-reflect. Finally, to develop her knowledge of corpus technology, May conducted an extensive literature review, which is an important source of professional development (Dirk et  al., 2017) and a path to acquiring new teaching technology and approaches (Lin, 2019).

Linking CBLP training to teacher professional development as a motivator. After their practice of learning and implementation of CBLP, both teachers regarded this learning process as a critical opportunity for professional development. Although it has been frequently demonstrated that teachers lack the motivation to apply corpus technology to their teaching after corpus training (e.g. Farr, 2008; Callies, 2019; Chambers, 2019; Leńko-Szymańska, 2017), our study indicates that teachers with an orientation to professional development are more willing to test corpus technology in their teaching, echoing a similar finding in Abdel Latif (2021). This implies that it would be helpful for corpus educators to show teacher participants how to conduct CBLP-related research as a way of enhancing their professional development, e.g. integrating teaching with research as shown by Tim and May. This can serve as a powerful motivator for teachers to boost their CBLP learning when receiving corpus training. Our study also suggests that it is important to help teachers foster their reflective awareness and abilities (e.g. through direct training and follow-up communication and support). Through this, they can analyse their teaching and students reflectively and find ways of surmounting possible challenges to the development of their CBLP.

Since our study shows that teacher learning and practice mutually benefit each other, this suggests that corpus educators should create various individual and collaborative learning opportunities to help teachers learn and practice CBLP simultaneously, including providing rich learning resources, encouraging teacher reflection, creating a peer-supportive environment, and motivating teachers with potential professional development opportunities.

# 6.  Conclusion

This case study documented the process of how two experienced in-service teachers developed their CBLP and identified how an important CALL technology, corpus technology, is integrated into language pedagogy. The two teachers addressed their student learning needs, set up suitable learning objectives, taught the lesson, and reflected on their CBLP development journey. In this sense, our study makes an important methodological contribution by setting a new direction (i.e. using the five stages of pedagogical reasoning) to investigate the use of corpora in teaching.

The two teachers made impressive progress in their CBLP growth, even though they differed in many aspects. These differences included the threshold level of corpus technology, target language skills (writing vs. reading), teaching focus (grammar vs. discourse), student backgrounds (Science vs. English) and levels (Year 2 vs. Year 4), teaching modes (online vs. classroom), and corpus tools (COCA vs. AntConc). We also examined a number of key factors concerning the teachers and their specific contexts in relation to their CBLP learning outcomes. Thus, our study may add evidence and contextualised information to inform and support the pedagogical practicality and feasibility of implementing CBLP in classroom teaching.

Furthermore, our study unveiled five components that are essential to the development of CBLP: knowledge of language subject, corpus technology, pedagogy, contexts, and the domain of practice and learning. In addition, our study portrayed different but interesting paths to developing CBLP, which are influenced by a number of factors. A number of practical implications are suggested, which may provide useful theoretical guidance for future teacher CBLP training and research. Finally, how to solve the technical issues regarding corpora use and how to motivate educators to try out a seemingly complicated new pedagogy (CBLP) might present significant challenges for researchers. Only when these problems are solved will busy teachers be persuaded to adopt corpus technology in classroom teaching.

There were two limitations of the study. First, due to practical constraints, Tim could only conduct online teaching, which might have affected his teaching delivery and student participation. Moreover, because the two teachers adopted different teaching modes (online vs. classroom), this could have complicated any interpretations of the data with respect to comparisons. It is suggested that future studies should adopt the same teaching modes to render any comparisons (if relevant) more appropriate. In addition, given the increased likelihood of teachers adopting online teaching, future studies should also investigate how online CBLP lessons could be designed and conducted effectively. Second, this study only focused on university teachers and future research should investigate teachers from non-university settings, especially primary or secondary schools. If language teachers within schools are convinced of the pedagogical value of corpus technology, more practitioners (including corpus developers and educators) would be willing to develop user-friendly corpus technology to assist teaching.

# Notes

1. The research team used a 4-point, 12-item Likert-scale survey to collect student feedback on the two CBLP lessons. Tim’s lesson received an overall evaluation of 3 out of 4.   
2. Using the same student evaluation form, May’s lesson received an overall evaluation of 3.43 out of 4.   
3. A KWIC is a common word search function in many corpus tools, where concordance lines are formed by sorting and aligning the searched key word.
