Abstract: Due to the wide-ranging development of data-oriented sustainable systems in the government and the public sectors, the development of such sustainable systems is replete with potential. The ultimate focus of developing these sustainable systems is to provide citizens with transparency, accountability, awareness as well as a single point of query for asking integrated and smart queries. In view of these benefits, the Saudi government has taken the initiative to publish and develop sustainable open data-oriented information systems. However some major challenges in the Saudi Government Open Data are that the (1) data are published and available in different formats such as Excel sheets, CSV files (Comma Separated Values), images, scanned documents and social media sources such as Twitter, (2) datasets from different government departments are not linked with each other or to existing datasets in Linked Open Data Cloud (even though they have strong links with each other), and (3) there is no SPARQL Endpoint that can be used to pose smart semantic-based queries to Saudi Government Data. This paper is part of an ongoing research project to present a framework that can be used to transfer the government data from different sources to RDF format. The framework can also be used to clean and classify/map the data according to the Saudi Government Ontology. We also describe our approach for semiautomatically linking Saudi Government Datasets with one another as well as with other existing open datasets, thus resulting in the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC). Finally, taking the topic “Public’s Response to Women’s Driving in Saudi Arabia” as a case study, we demonstrate the SLOGD SPARQL Endpoint as a data-oriented system by executing different queries and analyzing results of these queries. This work also contributes new insights into women’s driving in Saudi Arabia using the SLOGDC, thus suggesting the way forward in shaping policies for decision-making.

# 1. Introduction

The trend in developing data-oriented sustainable systems is rapidly shifting to open data-oriented sustainable systems, thus resulting in the production of Open Data (OD) and linkage with other Open Datasets to create Linked Open Data (LOD), which can be used to ask sophisticated queries. Some governments have led the initiative to produce Open Government Data (OGD)-oriented solutions [1]. However, despite major efforts in OGD publishing and consuming, the full value of OGD-oriented sustainable systems has yet to be realized. OGD sustainable systems do have some major issues. For instance, the chaotic organization of published OGD results in the same data being found within different data sources. Further, there tends to be a dearth of links between OGD datasets, and due to missed links, we are not able to develop open data-oriented sustainable systems and get new insights from different domains. Therefore, this situation calls for a solution that can transform Open Government Data (OGD) into Linked Open Government Data (LOGD) so that LOGD-oriented sustainable systems can be launched to produce better knowledge graphs for customers.

A number of initiatives have been undertaken in LOGD-driven systems such as the US Government Linked Open Data Available: Data.gov, UK Linked Open Government, and Singapore linked Open Data. These initiatives bring about government transparency and public participation. Moreover, people can access data sources without any restrictions, query multiple data sources, and develop valuable citizens’ applications. The Saudi Arabian government has made a major effort towards the establishment of e-government [2] and development of the Open Data portal (http://www.data.gov.sa/), which is an important initiative for the country [3].

However, in comparison with developed countries, Saudi Arabia is lagging behind in accessing the benefits of data-oriented sustainable systems [4]. The government data in the Saudi government portal has some limitations. For instance, not only is the OGD available on different official portals and websites, but also the links between OGD datasets and related datasets are missing. Some of the data provide an abstract which cannot be used for analysis and studies purposes, thus resulting in many hindrances to this data-oriented sustainable system. To address these limitations, we present the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDCF) framework that can be used to produce Saudi OGD-oriented sustainable systems for improving transparency, encouraging public participation, querying multiple data sources, and supporting better decision-making. The main contributions of study are as follows:

1. Development of a Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDCF) framework that extracts and processes data from various sources such as General Authority for Statistics (GaStat), Ministry of Human Resource and Social Development (HRSD), Ministry of Interior (MOI), Ministry of Civil Service (MCS), Ministry of Justice (MOJ), and Twitter datasets.   
2. Design and development of an ontology for Saudi Open Government Data and then mapping of the data according to the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Ontology (SLOGDO).   
3. Production of the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC) as a data-oriented sustainable system by semiautomatically linking Saudi Government Datasets with one another and with other existing open datasets.   
4. Enabling of the SLOGDC SPARQL endpoint and executing of different queries and analysis of the results of these queries vis-à-vis the topic “Public’s Response to Women’s Driving in Saudi Arabia” as a case study.   
5. Use of the results of analysis to get new insights into the factors that influence the public response to women’s driving in Saudi Arabia.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the related work is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 describes the SLOGDCF framework that we developed to extract the data to produce SLOGD Cloud. In Section 4, the Saudi Linked Open Government Data (SGLOD) Ontology is explained. The creation of Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud is discussed in Section 5. In Section 6, we present the SLOGDC SPARQL endpoint, perform different queries via the SPARQL endpoint, and discuss the results of queries. In Section 7, we present our case study analysis of the public’s response to women’s driving in Saudi Arabia from the SGLODC. Finally, Section 8 presents the conclusion to our work.

# 2. Related Work

The development of data-oriented sustainable systems has attracted considerable attention due to the potential benefits of such systems. Further the development of Open Government Data (OGD)-oriented sustainable systems have transformed into a global movement for open and smart government systems. Most governments [5–8] around the world publish their data in open data formats to enable public reuse of this data. Different government bodies also provide open data portals as a single point of access to open government datasets (OGD) in multiple domains [9]. Recent analysis shows that the public reuse these open datasets to add value and innovation in economic domain that they can undertake [10]. Linking and making these datasets openly available can improve transparency and support citizens, public sectors, and decision-makers in making sophisticated queries, analyzing the results, and using them in decision-making and policy formulation.

There are many data-oriented sustainable systems that have been developed based on linked open data (LOD) in various fields. For example, in the tourist field, researchers used linked open data (LOD) to support tourism within the local community system [11]. The authors described their approach to transferring tourism-related data into RDF data format and storing it as LOD in the tourism local community system. However, tourist information on temples, shrines, temples and historical facilities was not collected as part of this LOD. Additionally, in this study, a SPARQL endpoint to evaluate the quality of their data were not provided. In other research [12], the authors proposed a two-pronged method to creating LOD. This comprised first transferring the data sources into RDF documents and creating links between RDF datasets and then transferring the RDF documents back into original formats of data sources. However, as this method lacked the semantics in CVS files (Comma Separated Values), there was absence of a tool to discover and understand links in CVS data. In another work [13], the authors presented a model designed to classify government public information with support of ontologies by transforming Brazilian government open data into linked open data. However, there are massive volume of daily generated data with different formats, which are not open to processing under the proposed model. Similarly, a platform termed GovLOD is presented in another study [14]. The GovLOD platform is developed over linked open data principles to transform the open data sources into RDF triples which can be used to make queries. However, the main limitation of this work is that a manual mapping process is used in data transformation.

There are studies [15,16] that have used LOD to solve some urban problems. In Japan, they used LOD to detect the causality of urban problem and the related cost information of their budget sheets. They designed the RDF schema to these data and immediate actual causes and effects using crowdsourcing. They also used Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) for inferencing and SPARQL queries to detect problems. However, in some cases, it proved difficult to understand the causalities. In addition to this, the city government of Tokyo used the LOD to solve the urban problem of illegal parking of bicycles by raising social awareness. They extracted data based on factors and LOD and collected data from social networking services. They also published LOD and provided a web application to visualize the distribution of the illegal parking of bicycles in the city. However, in this study, there was a need to improve their estimation accuracy and to provide SPARQL endpoint to monitor the use of the illegal parking of bicycles LOD.

In the context of the Saudi government, there is very limited research in the field of Open Government Data (OGD) and Linked Open Government Data (LOGD). In one study [17], the authors proposed a model to measure openness level of data in Saudi Arabian Open Data Portal using a scoring model based on Global Open data index. They applied this model to measure the openness level of Saudi Open Government Data portal along with other five data portals in Taiwan, United Kingdom, Denmark Colombia, and Finland. The result of this model showed that Saudi Arabia’s final score as $3 2 . 2 3 \%$ points, which flagged the need for more improvements. They also recommended developing strategies to spread awareness of Open Government Data among citizens in Saudi Arabia.

Therefore, in this research, we proposed the use of SLOGDCF framework to create our Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC), which includes data sources from different domains. Then we performed different SPARQL queries by integrating data from different domains, which retrieved data from our RDF datasets and then retrieved data from other open datasets in the SLOGDC. This was done in order to get further and related information that would not have beenSLOGDC. This was done in order to get further and related information that would not have been possible if we had not created our SLOGDC. Besides the SPARQL queries, we present the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the resulting data.

# 3. Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud Framework (SLOGDCF)

In this section, we describe the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud Framework (SLOGDCF) that automates the process of producing LOGD from different data sources available in different formats and in different domains. The SLOGDCF framework can be used to collect, extract, process, generate RDF datasets and to map them to Saudi Linked Open Government Data Ontology (SLOGDO) so as to produce Saudi LOGD and Saudi LOGD cloud. The architecture of SLOGDC Framework consists of five modules: The Data Collection Module, Data Pre-processing Module, Data Modelling Module, Data Linking Module, and Data Querying/SPARQL Endpoint Module as shown in Figure 1. The following sections describe each of these modules in detail.

# 3.1. Data Collection Module

This module collected, traversed, and extracted Saudi Open Government Data (SOGD) datasets from various data sources in different domains such as General Authority for Statistics (GaStat), Ministry of Human Resource and Social Development (HRSD), Ministry of Interior (MOI), Ministry of Civil Service (MCS), Ministry of Justice (MOJ), and Twitter datasets. Those data were available in different formats such as CVS files (Comma Separated Values) and Excel sheets. It was used to traverse different data sources, such as government portals and websites, and extract necessary data entities from these data sources. In addition, child data sources such as links to nested pages of portal or CSV files were traversed and useful data entities were extracted from them. As part of this module, we also investigated the relations between different data entities of various government organizations. This process was done recursively until open data were collected. The collected datasets exist in Excel sheet and CVS forms. In the context of our case study, we extracted the data from different Saudi OGD sources as well as from Twitter about women’s driving in Saudi Arabia. The data from Twitter was extracted on the basis of different data attributes such as used hashtags, users’ tweets about the topic, user information, and number of tweets per day. The data from Twitter was extracted in structured format. The module resulted in the production of two types of datasets: Saudi OGD datasets from different sources in various domains and Twitter datasets. These datasets were prepared and processed in the next module of the framework.

# 3.2. Data Preprocessing Module

This module consisted of two submodules: Datasets Filter, and Datasets Cleaner. Each extracted and collected dataset from the previous module was subjected to data filtering and data cleaning. In the first submodule (i.e., datasets filter), we extracted, defined, and filtered data items that were required and related to our case study in this work. This module also dealt with inconsistency in data such as duplicated data and contradictory data, in addition to checking for missing data. The data consistency check was performed both on Saudi OGD datasets and Twitter datasets. Finally, this module produced the filtered Saudi OGD and Twitter datasets in Excel sheet and CVS formats. The second submodule was the dataset cleaner that removed any error and noise in both the datasets and transformed them in a consistent and structured format to prepare them for use in the next module. The module resulted in clean and processed datasets within a structured format.

# 3.3. Data Modelling Module

This module was responsible for adding semantics to processed datasets, i.e., cleaned Saudi OGD and Twitter datasets. This module consisted of three submodules: Saudi Government Ontology (SGO) Generator, RDF Mapper, and Triplifier. The first submodule (i.e., Saudi Government Ontology (SGO) Generator) took the filtered and cleaned datasets as input, identified the concepts or classes based on the filtered and cleaned datasets and also identified the semantic relationships between data entities within Saudi Government datasets as shown in Figure 2. We also investigated different existing vocabularies and reused them to the maximum extent. In addition to this, we utilized OWL reasoning features such as cardinality constraints and complex restrictions on properties as well as property type and equivalent and disjoint classes. The second submodule (i.e., RDF Mapper) was used to map datasets to SGO. We automatically classified and mapped the Saudi Government datasets according to SGO. The Triplifier submodule generated RDF triples of extracted data items in the form of Subject—Predicate—Object (as shown in Figure 3). In this module, we used the third-party tools and APIs such as OWL APIs that automatically generate RDF datasets in N-triples format.

In data linking process, we first examined the information that describes datasets to (SLOGDC).

Next, we established more relations between datadetermine the type of data and their relations. Next, we established more relations between data entities within dataset as well as relations between different datasets such as population datasets,entities within dataset as well as relations between different datasets such as population datasets, transportation datasets, job statistics datasets, education datasets, and Twitter datasets. The datatransportation datasets, job statistics datasets, education datasets, and Twitter datasets. The data items items in the SLOGDC were extracted from various data sources. All these data sources containedin the SLOGDC were extracted from various data sources. All these data sources contained data that were directly or indirectly related to our case study. In addition to this, we semiautomatically created, managed, and determined the type of relations between data entities and within the dataset as well as the type of relations between different datasets. As a last step, we semiautomatically managed the linkage rules between different data sources then the RDF links were generated automatically between these data entities to one another in order to create SLOGDC. Including data from multiple data sources helped to create bigger knowledge graphs, which ultimately proved to be useful for the purpose of effective analysis.

# 3.5. Data Querying/SPARQL Endpoint Module

This module served as a front end for the final users. Our SLOGD SPARQL endpoint was available as a public access point that could be used to execute different queries and analyze results by considering the different factors influencing the public’s response to female drivers in Saudi Arabia. Our framework hid the complexity of linked data technology from end users.

# 4. The Saudi Linked Open Government Data Ontology (SLOGDO)

The Saudi Government Ontology (SGO) was the core step and key for building SLOGD. The Saudi government data lacked structural support for constructing the Saudi Linked Open Data (SLOD). In this section, we introduced our Saudi Linked Open Government Data Ontology (SLOGDO) based on the nature of SOGD datasets. The generation of Saudi Government Ontology did not require user intervention. Further, based on SGO, we automatically generated RDF datasets. The resulting RDF data were at the 4-star level of 5-star open data model [18]. In addition, based on the ontology design patterns, we provided a solid model and rich semantic vocabularies for promoting the goal of opening Saudi OGD with linked data technologies. The SLOGD includes mixed datasets, which were created using our SGO in order to infer new knowledge as well as bigger knowledge graphs. Based on the nature of Saudi Open datasets, we realized the following patterns: Organization, Category, Datasets, and Data Entry.

In the section below, we describe the process of generating Saudi Linked Open Government Data Ontology (SLOGDO) based on ontology design patterns:

Classes: the classes refer to the vocabularies related to our data domains such as the driving, job statistics, education, population, economic, and social or public impact/response to women’s driving in Saudi Arabia. The ontology concept extracted were such that they represent right and valid group of concepts domain of government data [19]. The description of core ontology classes is as follows:

Data_Entry: this class is used to represent a set of dimensions.   
Organization: this class is used to represent the public or private agencies that published the dataset.   
Dataset: this class is used to represent the statistical datasets, which are the container of data, e.g., population datasets or economic datasets.   
Category: this class is used to represent the category or type that the dataset belongs to, e.g., transportation and Labor_Market_&_Social_Security.

Based on core ontology classes and reuse of ontology design patterns, the core classes and their relations were extended to obtain the semantic structure of ontology for Saudi Open Government Data (SOGD). The use of ontology design patterns based on our case study in this work was as follows: (1) use of Data_Entry Pattern, (2) use of Organization Pattern, (3) use of Datasets Pattern, and (4) use of Category Pattern.

A. Use of Data_Entry Pattern: In the Saudi Government field, data entry represents a set of dimensions such as region, year, and measurements, e.g., number of driving license, number of accidents, and violation. Therefore, based on our case study in this work, we define the following as subclasses of Data_Entry: Driving_Licenses, Traffic_Violations,

Traffic_Accidents, Divorce_Documents, Marriage_Contract, Labor_Market, and Household_Income. We also define relations belong_to_Dataset, and has_region, number_of_Accident, number_of_Violations, total_Female_Employed_Persons, total_Female_Employment_Rate, total_Female_Unemployment_Rate, divorced_Income,Sustainability Sustainability 2020, Sustainability 2020, educational_Status_Bachelors, married_Income, saudi_Female_Job_Seekers,20, 12, x  x x number_of_Divorce_Documents, and number_of_Marriage_Contracts. In order to enable the SGO to be automatically processed and understood by machine, we represented the Saudi Government and number_of_Marriage_Contracts.

We automatically processed and represented the machine-understandable semantics of SGO. In addition to this, we evaluated it using the various reasoners to check the correctness and consequences of ontology as well as to detect any logical errors.

# Reasoning and Inference

Ontologies are used to describe the concepts in the domain and also the relationships among those concepts [21]. The OWL ontology consists of classes, properties, and individuals [22]. We have modelled SLOGD semiautomatically and verified its semantic and syntactical consistency using OWL reasoners such as Pellet and Jena reasoners. We also used the SWRL to encode the different relationships. Some of these relationships are shown in Equations (1) and (2), which represent the fact that the Datasets belong to Category and Category is related To Organization. Thus, we can infer that the Organization is owner of Datasets. Organization include_category and Category include_Dataset. Thus, we can infer that the Datasets has_Owner Organization include_Category, which is shown in Equation (2). Without the inferencing power of the OWL, the machine has no way of understanding these relations and restrictions between classes.

Organization (?o) ˆ include_Category (?o,?c) ˆ include_Dataset $( \mathrm { ? c , ? d } ) $ has_Owner (?d,?o).

# 5. Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC)

The five-star open data model promotes the publishing of open data using linked data principles such as publication of data in RDF format and integration of data into linked data web [9]. We made use of the best practices of LOD to link related datasets within the SLOGDC from different data sources in different domains such as General Authority for Statistics, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Labour and Social Development, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of education, and Twitter. As an example, the LOD Cloud contains 1234 datasets and 16,136 links from various domains [23]. Some of these datasets can be accessed through SPARQL endpoint, which is a way to retrieve and publish data [24]. In order to link our SOGD to one another, we represented SOGD using semantic web technologies such as RDF, triples, URIs, and OWL as explained in the previous section. The URIs are used to describe resources; a triple has the form subject-predicate-object [25].

To create SLOGDC, we identified relationships and possible links between data entities from different data sources to link these entities together using different interlinking approaches. These approaches enable access and are used to retrieve related and detailed information.

The interlinking approaches result in the SLOGDC as shown in Figure 5, which includes different interlinked data sources in different domains and ministries. We examined the properties of the datasets to determine links based on certain conditions. In our SLOGDC datasets, there are three types of links between datasets. The first type of link is the links between datasets that belong to the same organization; this link will establish if the number of same or similar properties between two datasets is one or more and also if the two datasets belong to the same organization. The second type of links are links between datasets that belong to different organizations; this link will establish if the number of same or similar properties between two datasets is one or more and also if the two datasets belong to different organizations. The third type of links are links between SLOGD and other existing open datasets; this link will establish if the number of same or similar properties between two datasets is one or more. So, there are many technologies to link resources such as machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), entity disambiguation. In addition, there are other tools with these technologies toSustainability 2020, 12, x 11 of 2 link resources among multiple knowledge bases such as SILK, LIMES, and Linked Data Integration Framework (LDIF).

# 6. Saudi Linked Open Government Data (SLOGD) SPARQL Endpoint

The SPARQL endpoint is a way to access and query SLOGDC. In this section, we describe the The SPARQL endpoint is a way to access and query SLOGDC. In this section, we describe thSLOGD SPARQL endpoint for querying the SLOGDC, which includes different datasets. We made use SLOGD SPARQL endpoint for querying the SLOGDC, which includes different datasets. We madof SLOGDC to query different factors in different domains such as the issued driving license, accidents, use of SLOGDC to query different factors in different domains such as the issued driving licensviolations, job statistics, education, marital status, household income, and social or public impact/response to accidents, violations, job statistics, education, marital status, household income, and social or publiwoman driving in Saudi Arabia. Besides the SPARQL (RDF query language) queries, in the next section, impact/response to woman driving in Saudi Arabia. Besides the SPARQL (Rwe present the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the resulting data.

In this section, we also provide an evaluation of our SGO and the quality of SLOGDC by executing SPARQL queries through SPARQL endpoint. Thus, we created 20 competency questions to be answered by the knowledge base some of which are shown in Table 3. These questions were created in accordance with the case study in this paper. The SPARQL queries executed for each defined question in Table 3. Figure 6 shows the query for the question Q1, e.g., find the number of driving licenses issued in different regions of Saudi Arabia in a year wise pattern from SLOGDC. In addition, Figure 7 shows the results of the SPARQL query and shows the number of driving licenses issued in different regions of Saudi Arabia during the years 2017 and 2018.

# 7.1. Issued Driving Licenses

ssued Driving LicensesFrom the results and queries shown in the previous section, we can identify the number of driving From the results and queries shown in the previous section, we can identify the number of licenses issued in 2017 and 2018 within different regions of Saudi Arabia. We can conclude that the top three regions with the greatest number of issued driving licenses in Saudi Arabia include the that the top three regions with the greatest number of issued driving licenses in Saudi Arabia Riyadh region, Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, and the Eastern region (Figure 11). Moreover, we can observe include the Riyadh region, Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, and the Eastern region (Figure 11). Moreover, that there is rapid increase in the number of driving licenses issued in these regions during the period of 2017 to 2018. The Riyadh region issued the most driving licenses (495,307 in 2017 and 493,224 in 2018) and when compared with different regions in Saudi Arabia, the issuing of licenses increased from 2017 to 2018. In terms of the number of licenses issued, Riyadh is followed by Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, which also has a high number of issued driving licenses (142,487 in 2017 and 144,873 in 2018) amongst different regions in Saudi Arabia. The Eastern region also issued the third highest number of driving licenses (126,816 in 2017 and 131,639 in 2018) to drivers. In addition to this, the number of issued driving licenses in other regions in Saudi Arabia are as follows: Assir region (39,133 in 2017 and 22,362 in 2018), Madinah region (36,165 in 2017 and 23,335 in 2018), Hail region (22,035 in 2017 and 39,575 in 2018), Jazan region (18,345 in 2017 and 12,265 in 2018), Najran region (13,825 in 2017 and 7431 in 2018), Tabouk region (10,232 in 2017 and 7613 in 2018), Al-Jouf region (8091 in 2017 and 6834 in 2018), $A l .$ -Qaseem region (6318 in 2017 and 4457 in 2018), Northern Border region (5280 in 2017 and 3661 in 2018), and $A l$ -Baha region (4131 in 2017 and 2575 in 2018). The graph in Figure 11 presents a comparison between the numbers of driving licenses issued in various regions of Saudi Arabia in 2017 and 2018.

# 7.5. Marital Status

The analysis of results from SLOGDC showed that there was a strong relationship between thenability 2020, 12, x 21 of 26 marriage status and the public’s response to women’s driving. For example, from the results that we retrieved from the queries shown in the previous section (i.e., Figure 9b), we can easily identify that the number of marriage contracts and divorce documents also increased in the same top three regions with the highest number of issued driving licenses, the number of accidents, and the number of violations. These regions were the Riyadh region, the Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, and the Eastern Region. From the results, we can conclude that the marriage contracts numbered 30,296 in the Riyadh region, 41,114 in the Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, and 18,587 in the Eastern Region. The marriage contracts in the other regions in Saudi Arabia were as follows: Assir region 13,031, Madinah region 10,709, Jazan region 8696, Al-Qaseem region 7399, Tabouk region 4165, Hail region 4122, Al-Jouf 3528, Najran region 3358, Al-Baha region 2475, and Northern Boarder 2327. In addition, the number of divorce documents totaled 12,807 in the Riyadh region, 15,593 in the Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, and 7761 in the Eastern Region. The divorce documents in the other regions in Saudi Arabia were as follows: Assir region 4562, Madinah region 4089, AL-Qaseem region 3.058, Jazan region 2434, Tabouk region 2025, Hail region 1665, Al-Jouf 1362, Najran region 1044, Northern Boarder 923, and Al-Baha region 726. The graph in Figure 14 presents the number of marriage contracts and divorce documents in Saudi Arabia in 2018.

# 7.6. Household Income

Another factor that can influence or affect the adoption of driving by women in Saudi Arabia is the “Household Income.” From the results retrieved (Figure 10d) and queries (Figure 9b) shown in the previous section, we can observe the comparative effect of the household income and marital status in different regions in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the other factors such as the number of drivinglicenses issued in Saudi Arabia regions, people opinion and how they react to woman driving in licenses issued in Saudi Arabia regions, people opinion and how they react to woman driving in Twitter, and the number of divorce documents, and marriage contracts in Saudi Arabia regions are present. These factors identified the top three regions with the greatest number of driving licenses issued and the increasing number of marriage contracts and divorce documents in Saudi Arabia, namely, the Riyadh region, the Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, and the Eastern Region. In addition to other factors such as issued driving licenses and the increasing number of marriage contracts and divorce documents, we observed from the results (Figure 10d) that the household income for divorced and married people also had high impact on the adoption of women’s driving in regions with the greatest number of issued driving licenses, the number of accidents, and the number of violations, and the increasing number of marriage contracts and divorce documents in Saudi Arabia. The results also showed the comparative impact of household income on divorced and married people in the top three regions. So, in the Riyadh region, the household income for divorced people was 12,950 RS, whereas the household income for married people was 16,495 RS and in Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, the household income for divorced people was 11,790 RS, whereas the household income for married people was 15,430 RS. Finally, in the Eastern region, the household income for divorced people was 17,472 RS, whereas the household income for married people was 18,240 RS. The graph in Figure 15 compares the household income of divorced and married people per region in Saudi Arabia in 2018.per region in Saudi Arabia in 2018.

Figure 15. The household income of divorced and married people per regions in Saudi Arabia in Figure 15. The household income of divorced and married people per regions in Saudi Arabia in 2018.

Moreover, based on Figure 15, we can conclude the following: First, the household incomes for divorced and married people are high in the same top three regions that have the greatest number of issued driving licenses, the number of accidents and the number of violations, the number of divorce documents and the number of marriage contracts in Saudi Arabia, namely, the Riyadh region, the Makkah Al-Mokarramah region, and the Eastern region. Secondly, we observed that in the same top three regions, the household income for married people exceeded the household income for divorced people. Thirdly, in most of regions in Saudi Arabia, the household income for married peopledivorced people. Thirdly, in most of regions in Saudi Arabia, the household income for married exceeded the household income for divorced people except in the Northern Border region where thepeople exceeded the household income for divorced people except in the Northern Border region household income for divorced people exceeded the household income for married people. Finally,where the household income for divorced people exceeded the household income for married in the AL-Qaseem region, the household income for divorced people and the household income forpeople. Finally, in the AL-Qaseem region, the household income for divorced people and the divorced people was approximately the same.household income for divorced people was ap

# 7.7. Educational Status

In the context of the discussion above, the statistics show that Education was also an important factor with direct influence on the acceptance of the decision to permit women to drive in Saudi Arabia. Due to the interlinked datasets in the SLOGDC, we were able to retrieve “Education” as an influential factor and impact/relationship between the education and women’s driving. From the queries shown in the previous section (Figure 9c), we identified the Saudi population by Administrative area and educational status. The results show that most of people in the top three regions such as theAdministrative area and educational status. The results show that most of people in the top three Riyadh region, the Makkah Al-Mokarramah region and the Eastern region also attained high education in comparison with citizens in other regions of Saudi Arabia. For instance, the number of people with Bachelor-level education in the Riyadh region totaled 678,994, whereas the number of people with Bachelor-level education in the Makkah Al-Mokarramah region totaled 770,888, and the number of people with Bachelor-level qualifications in the Eastern region numbered 414,413. The number of people with Bachelor-level education in other regions in Saudi Arabia were as follows: Assir region 182,948, MadinahThe number of people with Bachelor-level education in other regions in Saudi Arabia were as region 182,180, Jazan region 133,463, $A l .$ -Qaseem region 131,233, Tabouk region 82,243, Hail region 65,280, Al-Baha region 64,581, Al-Jouf 55,206, Northern Boarder 40,034, and Najran region 36,949. The graph inTabouk region 82,243, Hail region 65,280, Al-Baha region 64,581, Al-Jouf 55,206, Northern Boarder 40,034, Figure 16 compares the number of people with Bachelor-level education region wise in Saudi Arabia in 2018.educatio

Figure 16. The number of people with bachelor’s degrees per region in Saudi Arabia in 2018.

Moreover, the other factors such as the number of driving licenses issued in Saudi Arabia regions, people opinion and how they react to woman driving in Twitter, the household income by their marital status and by regions and the number of divorce documents and marriage contracts in Saudi Arabia regions are present. Based on Figure 16, we can conclude that most of the people in the top three regions such as Riyadh, Makkah Al-Mokarramah, and the Eastern region are highly educated in comparison with residents in other regions of Saudi Arabia.

# 8. Discussion and Conclusions

Data-oriented sustainable systems provide the means to undertake intelligent data analytics that can ultimately be used for decision-making and policy formulation. Linked Open Data (LOD)-oriented sustainable systems are one step ahead in that they provide the means to catalyze transparency, confidence, and accountability for government and other public bodies in multiple areas. In this paper, we presented our Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud Framework (SLOGDCF), which can be used for extracting data from different data sources in multiple domains such as Saudi Open Data, General Authority for Statistics, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Labour and Social Development, and Ministry of Justice, Ministry of education, and Twitter. Then we showed how the SLOGDCF framework can be used to produce RDF datasets and Saudi Government Ontology (SGO), in addition to semiautomatically mapping Saudi Government datasets to Saudi Government Ontology (SGO). We presented the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC), which we produced by creating links amongst Saudi RDF datasets and with other datasets in the LOD cloud. We also developed a SPARQL Endpoint as a point of contact to Open Government Data-oriented sustainable system that can be used to ask smart semantic-based queries to SLOGDC in different domains using SPARQL protocol. As a proof of concept to our work, we undertook quantitative and qualitative analyses of the results on the topic “Public’s Response to Women’s Driving in Saudi Arabia.” In our case study, we identified and analyzed different factors of influence on public opinion such as education, social status, job statistics, and economic status in terms of women’s driving in Saudi Arabia. The results that we retrieved from our Open Government-Oriented sustainable system and analysis of these results can be used by decision-makers to shape policies and guide decision-making in the implementation of new rules and policies. As future work, we will provide a dashboard or public interface that can be used by end users to query our SLOGDC and to produce results/charts for analysis. In addition, analyzing other factors related to accidents and violations such as accidents or violations during school start and end timings, office start, and end timings.
