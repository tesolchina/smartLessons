Interdisciplinary collaboration   
Pedagogical innovation

Under the current trend of curriculum reform in higher education worldwide, many institutions have taken the initiative to develop English for Specific Academic Purposes (EsAP) courses to cater for students' diverse needs for disciplinary learning and future professional practices. This paper illustrates the pedagogical innovations in an ESAP course to facilitate undergraduates' disciplinary learning at an international university in Hong Kong. Based on the data collected from students and discipline teachers, we, as the course developers, reflected upon the opportunities and challenges in implementing the revamped EsAP course. Our reflections reveal the importance of promoting flipped learning and peer feedback practices in the ESAP classroom and interdisciplinary collaboration between ESAP course developers and discipline teachers. This paper will be of interest not only to ESAP teachers but also to discipline teachers who intend to promote best practices for effective disciplinary studies through English teaching and learning in higher education.

# 1. The context and issues of curriculum reform

Under the current trend of curriculum reform in higher education worldwide, many institutions have taken the initiatives to develop English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP) courses to cater for students diverse needs for disciplinary learning and future professional practices. The context of this study has also undergone a structural reform in the undergraduate curriculum. Many universitie have revamped thir EAP courses to cater for the currcular and pedagogical changes in the respective disciplines. In the university where ths study took place, undergraduates are required to enrol ina credit-bearing EAP course after completing a general EAP course inthe first year of study (Law & Fong, 2020; Yung & Fong, 2019). The ESAP course is a language-focused course developed in the revamped undergraduate currculum to support students in learning appropriate and effctive disciplinary academic English litracy skills Hyland (2022) pointed out that because of the diverse conventions of academic communication across disciplines it is crucial to identify the specific discourse practice, language features and communicative skill of various groups of learners in collaboration with discipline teachers in other disciplines in order to enrich students' disciplinary learning.

In this paper, we, as the course developers and researchers, reflect on the revamp of an ESAP course for Speech and Hearing Sciences (SHs) students. During the time of curculum reform, Fong was a Lecturer and the coordinator of ESAP courses for the Faculty of Education. She was assigned to revamp the ESAP course for HS students. Yung was an Assistant Lecturer who assisted the course development. We, together with two other collagues, developed the ESAP course in a year's time. Fong secured a Teaching

Development Grant as the Principal Investigator to develop and evaluate the implementation of the revamped ESAP course, and Yung was the Co-Investigator of the project.

Before the currculum reform, collaoration between ESAP course developers and the discipline teachers (i.e., teachers in the SHS discipline) was lacking. The previous ESAP course for SHS students was pedagogically teacher-centred and focused primaril onessay writing. The link between the content in the ESAP course and their disciplinary learning was minimal. Under the currculum reform, the SHS programme centres on theoretical knowledge in language acquisition and clinical practices in speech therapy I line with the student-centred initiative, the SHS programme has adopted problem-based learning (PBL), a curricular approach that \*empowers learners to conduct research, integrate theory and practice, and apply knowledge and sils to develop a viable solution to a defined problem'" (Savery, 2015, p. 5). Accordingly, as the course developers, we elected to build the revamped EsAP course around learner-centredness to prepare students for the demand of PBL in their discipline.

# 2. Addressing the issues

# 2.1. Establishing a close collaboration with discipline teachers

The reform in the undergraduate currculum provided an opportunity for us to revamp the ESAP cours and make it more discipline-specific to foster transfer of leaning to students own disciline. The first step was to establish collaboration with discipline teachers, which could helpstrengthen ESAP teachers' knowledge of disciplinary practice to beter understand the students' English learning needs. We contacted three discipline teachers at the initial stage of course development. In addition to the formal 1-h interview with each of them, we engaged in ongoing dialogue via WhatsApp and email throughout the year to understand SHS students learning needs. We also asked them to provide us with their curriculum, teaching materials and past student assgnments as input. These served as useful course materials for ESAP teachers to demonstrate writing conventions in SHS genre practices. Specifically, the discipline teachers pointed out that SHS students needed to complete a reading form before each PBL session to summarise the key concepts in assigned readings and relat them to the problem case for critical discussion. They alo needed to write areflective journal about their PBL experience after each case to evaluate their own strengths and weaknese i the PBL discussion. Therefore, in the revamped 12-week ESAP course, in addition to academic essay writing, we decided to addthe discipline-specific writing skill for reading forms and reflective ournals (see Tables 1 and 2 for the changes in course learning outcomes and course asessments).We established a research collaboration wth the discipline teachers to joinly develope-learning and peer asessment activities to support students' in-clas and out-of-class learning (see Table 3 for the changes in key learning areas). Through this collaboration, we could gain a wider understanding of students' language needs and correspondingly develop appropriate teaching approaches and materials closely aligned with disciplinary learning outcomes. Students could therefore transfer the knowledge from this ESAP course to their discipline.

# 2.2. Promoting peer feedback and flipped learning

Pedagogically, contrary to the traditional aroach in which teachers lecture in class and students do assignments at home, we adopted fliped-lerning in the ESAP course because we believed this could maximis classroom interaction for more collaborative and reflective learning. This means that \*the typical activities of classroom lectures followed by homework in traditional teaching procedures are reversed in order" (Hung, 2015, p. 81). In the ESAP course, students learn the kills of writing reading forms, academic essays and reflection out of classon the Moodle e-learning platform and practise them in the flpped classroom. Students complete Moodle tasks and analyse exemplars at home, and discuss their responses and apply the leaned skills in clas. Fig. 1 illstrates the flipped learning model for the course.

In the classroom, students produce the essay, reading forms and reflective writing with ample teacher and peer feedback throughout the course. At the begining (Wees 1-2), students form groups of four to brainstorm topics they are interested in within the framework of early childhood language development set by the Hs discipline. They refine their topics and obtain feedack on their essay outlines and draft of paragraphs from their groupmates and the ESAP teacher (Weeks 3-8). Meanwhile they learn reading strategies and analyse reading form exemplars on Moodle and discuss their draft of reading forms in class (Weeks 3-5). Skill for reflective writing are covered throughout the second half of the course (Weeks 5-12).

Before submitting thir final essy and reading form, students upload ther draft ontoMoodle to exchange feedack. Teachers offer class feedback for the student. tudents are aso guided to conduct elfasessment on ther rflective writing before final submission. Such interplay between in-class and out-of-cass leaning and ample opportunities for peer and teacher feedback can facilitate ongoing feedback processes and foster self-directed learning throughout the course (Carless & Winstone, 2023).

# 2.3. Eliciting evaluative feedback from students and discipline teachers

To evaluate the effectiveness of these curriculum and pedagogical changes, we collcted feedback through student questionnaires, focus-group interviews with students, and individual interviews with discipline teachers.

We asked the students to complete an online questionnaire in the middle of the semester and another in the last teaching week of the semester. On a5-point Likert scale, the questionnaires elicited their views on the in-class and out-f-clas materials and how they benefited from the ESAP course and applied the academic English skill to their disciplinary study. Among the 49 students in the cohort, 43 completed the interim and 38 completed the end-of-course questionnaires.

At the end of the course, the students were invited to participate in a focus group interview on a voluntary basis. Nearly $6 0 \%$ $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } =$ 29) of the students participated and explained the questionnaire indings and their views on the course design, withaspecific focus on the pedagogical nnovations. They gave in-depth comments on the design of the course materials and applications of the learned academic English skill to their discipline and evaluated their learning motivation and experience. In addition, three discipline teachers participated in an individual interview to share their views on whether their students could apply the English kills in PBL. We then transcribed, translated, coded, and studied the interview data, which informed our rflections on revamping the ESAP course and pedagogical approaches.

# 3. Reflections from course developers

Reflecting on the findings solicited from the students and discipline teachers, we highlight the opportunities and challenges of revamping and implementing the ESAP course from the course developers' perspective.

Fig. 1. The flipped learning model.

3.1. Strengthening the complementary roles between ESAP teachers and discipline teachers

ESAP teachers' expertise in linguistic input can fl the gap of discipline teachers' role focusing on subject knowledge. A discipline teacher considered students' language ability important to their teaching, especially when giving feedback, even though it was not their teaching focus:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Discipline teacher 2:</td><td>We tend to give feedback on whether their direction and concepts are correct. We seldom comment on their use of English.</td></tr><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>Is language important to you?</td></tr><tr><td>Discipline teacher</td><td>Very important! We have to understand what they are writig. f they are weak at expressng themselves, like in reading form when they</td></tr><tr><td>2:</td><td>are unable to explain the concepts, we will not be able to judge whether they understand those concepts or not.</td></tr></table></body></html>

By increasing students' writing ability, discipline teachers can better know the extent to which their students understand the content and then give more timely and specific eedack to them. Another discipline teacher highlighted the importance of language in creating a concept map to consolidate students' learning in PBL tutorials and the sharing of teaching responsibilitis in different areas:

Creating a concept map is not like writing an essy. Itis content-driven. From the perspective of English language, students need to use good linking words, and words like \*predicts", compares", clasifies", is consisted of. Actuall, we have already had a page on the handbook containing those cognitive mental state words, but we won't highlight those words .. We may not be capable of teaching them these from a language perspective. (Discipline teacher 1)

In addition, the complementary roles between ESAP teachers and discipline teachers can facilitate more effective teaching and learning in the SHS discipline. The writing of reading forms in our revamped ESAP course was considered a new genre by the SHS students. As disciline teachers might not have devoted sufficient time and resources to teaching reading forms as a writing output in their programme, students appreciated that they could learn it in the ESAP course:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>OK. Speaking of reading forms, what difficulties did you encounter when you wrote them?</td></tr><tr><td>Student 1</td><td>I didn&#x27;t know how to start. [...] We didn&#x27;t know the format and structure at all at the beginning.</td></tr><tr><td>Student 2</td><td>Itis beer n se this coure ght u the stre writing the diaosi ody some suporig i. hi is the asi ture. This gave us some direction as to what to write.</td></tr></table></body></html>

The students generall felt that they learned how to analyse the structure and language use in a reading form in the ESAP course (Table 4). They also liked the use of exemplars (e.g., past student assignments) and found them useful:

We were introduced to the reading form at the beginning of the course. But actually at that time, our Speech courses did not cover much regarding how to write reading forms. By studying the samples provided in the [ESAP]course, [the ESAP teachers] helped us get things started. (Student interview)

By analysing the samples, students became more aware of the organisation and linguistic features of the genre. The improvement of students' writing of reading forms was also observed by their discipline teachers:

My PBL tutor commented 'a significant improvement for my reading forms, and I was really amazed. This is certainly an unexpected gain I earned from this course. (Student interview)

The students now can keep up with the pace very quickly. For example, they now know how to write a reading form. [..] They are making progres, and their writing is well-organised. .. Their learning has become more focused. What they are learning [in the ESAP course] can be applied immediately. (Discipline teacher 1)

Students' self-evaluation and the fedback from the discipline teachers reveal students' improvement in writing reading forms. While ESAP teachers and discipline teachers have diffrent expertise and focus on different aspects of student learning, the distinction can sometimes be blurred as content and language are hardly separable (Wilkinson, 2018). The ESAP course may have familiarised the students with the structure and language of various writing genres such as reading forms for PBL, but the studentstill need to know how to apply their disciplinary knowledge into their writing. As one of the students commented:

The problems [in PBL] got more and more complicated; after reading them, we sill didn't know how to make the application Even though we knew the structure [of reading forms now], we needed some time to extract the relevant details from the readings as support. (Student interview)

We tried to read the students' assigned PBL readings and teach them how to apply the content into their writing. Although the students found this practice generally beneficial, as shown in the high percentage of agreement in items It is beneficial to use my assigned PBL readings for in-class English learning" and Using my assigned PBL readings for in-class English learning has demonstrated to me the language requirements and conventions (e.g., reading and writing) in my discpline, a challenge for ESAP teachers was the lack of disciplinary knowledge and the substantial time devoted to reading. Upon reflection, we decided to emphasise to the students our role of language teaching and leave the content aspect to the students regarding how they could incorporate the content into their writing. We also did not want to cross the border and step into teaching the students how to fulfil thir disciplinary

requirements in PBL.

# 3.2. Monitoring student progress in out-of-class learning

The flipped leaning mode emphasised students independent learning out-of-clas, but hs initiative in the revamped ESAP course did not go as expected. Students were upposed to visit oodle and complete online tasks every week (see Fig. 1), but the questionnaire data shows that throughout the semester, $6 8 . 4 \%$ students only visited Moodle one to three times and only $1 3 . 2 \%$ visited four to six times, and $1 8 . 4 \%$ never completed any Moodle tasks. According to the students, the main reason for not engaging in out-of-class learning was the heavy workload in their disciplinary learning:

Workload of SHS students is really heavy. We have to hand in reading forms and all other PBL related assignments twice a week and I don't think students can afford doing out-of-class learning. (Open-ended comment in questionnaire)

Other students shared simpler views:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>How often did you work on the Independent Learning Tasks on Moodle?</td></tr><tr><td>Student 3</td><td>Once, at the very beginning.</td></tr><tr><td>Student 4</td><td>I completed all the previous tasks in one go.</td></tr><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>Why did you visit the site for few times only?.</td></tr><tr><td>All students</td><td>No time!</td></tr></table></body></html>

These excerpts reveal students lack of motivation to complete the independent learning tasks on Moodle. Under the heavy workload in thir discipline, the students inevitably prioritised their disciplinary courses over the ESAP course, which they usually regarded as supplementary to their degree. Another reason is that the Moodle tasks in the ESAP course were not graded, so most students did not find them important, as a student commented:

To be honest, when we are very busy and the tasks are not graded, they are a bit meaningless. (Student interview)

When we asked them to evaluate the effectiveness of the Moodle tasks, at least $2 6 . 3 \%$ chose "Unable to evaluate' because they did not complete enough tasks. Those who did, however, might find the tasks useful:

I think the reflection template is useful. I read it when I did my final reflection. I read the sample. But I couldnt afford the time each week to visit the site. (Student interview)

Despite the challenges of the lack of motivation required for independent leaning, the students and discipline teachers generally perceived the flipped learning mode an inevitable part of the ESAP course to train thir slf-regulated learning capacity required in PBL. As one of the students shared, \*in fact, PBL is a type of independent learning" (Student interview).

Upon reflection, what may be eeded i for EAP teachers to monitor students learning progres (e.., check their engagement with the Moode tasks, conduct in-clas quizzes) and adjust their teaching throughout the course to ensure students' engagement in the out. of-class eaning tasks. ourse developers may also consider whether the out-of-cass tass should be assesed to \*force the students to complete them tasks, and if so, how. To revamp the course further, we would consider allocating a small proportion of grade (e.g, $1 0 { - } 1 5 \%$ for independent learning, but more importantly we would highlight how those tasks could benefit their ESAP and disciplinary learning more explicitly throughout the course.

# 3.3. Amplified opportunities for peer feedback

The concept of formative feedback to feedforward was perceived to be beneficial to sustain student' learning. Students not only received feedback from their teachers on how to improve reading forms and the essay but, more importantly, they worked as a community and supported one another with peer feedback. The value of peer asessment was that the students could develop their

Table 4 Evaluation of learning in the ESAP course (selected items).

metacognitive skills in assessing their peers' work. This is illustrated in the excerpt below:   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>Was the feedback in the peer critique useful?</td></tr><tr><td>Student 5</td><td>Everyone gave pretty positive feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>Student 6</td><td>The comments I received were fair and reasonable.</td></tr><tr><td>Student 7</td><td>It was good to read others&#x27; work because you could know how others wrote their essays.</td></tr><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>Hm.</td></tr><tr><td>Student 8</td><td>I could learn something.</td></tr><tr><td>Student 9</td><td>I think peer critique was good. You could see what you could learn from the others.</td></tr></table></body></html>

In the interviews, the students generally agred with one another that peerassessment was an fective strategy o sustain mutual learning within a community and the feedback could be used to feedforward to improve their writing.

Such values and beliefs were enriched with the use of technology as a platform. The following excerpt shows how the students reacted positively on the use of Moodle as an e-learning platform for in-class writing:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>Moodle was used in in-class writing as a platform for peer feedback. Was it good?</td></tr><tr><td>Student 10:</td><td>It was prett god. Even though we were given plenty of time to prepare for the essay, it was not until [the teacher] asked usto write the introdctiondid we spend sometime thinking carfully how o writ. lthough I ddn usthe paragaph  had witen in the ed i as good to give us some time to write and think in class and read others&#x27; work.</td></tr><tr><td>Interviewer:</td><td>Hm. So you like the idea of writing, thinking and editing in class, right?</td></tr><tr><td>Student 10:</td><td>Right.</td></tr><tr><td>Student 11:</td><td>The Moodle platform allowed us to look at others&#x27; work. This gave us an opportunity to learn from one another.</td></tr></table></body></html>

This excerpt also suggests that the students valued the idea of flpped classroom. The students consolidated the writing skill at home and then drafted their essay and reading forms in class This way, they were able to discuss their work during class time with their peers and teacher.

Interestingly, however, students seemed to value teacher feedback more than peer feedback, as shown in Table 5. The ESAP course encouraged students to take the initiatives and help one another in the learning process. Teachers were supposed to give general class feedback before they marked their first draft so that students can criticlly evaluate their own work without overly depending on the teacher. A challenge was that while students rcognised the usefulnes of peercitique, they stll rlied on the teachers fedback more. probably because the teacher was the one who determined their grade. Whil the role of tudents was emphasised in the writing process by creating more peer lning opportunities and reducing prescriing students with teacher fedback, this may diminish teachers roles and create negative impacts on student evaluations of teaching. This observation reveals the importance of striking a balance between the amount of teacher feedback given and the extent of student involvement in per critique throughout the writing proces.

# 4. Conclusion and implications

This paper has illustrated how we revamped an ESAP course (e.g., adding critical reading and reflective writing skill, strength. ening peer fedback and out-f-clas learning) in responseto the crrculum reform in a discipline (i.., the intoductio of PBL in the SHS). Reflecting from the course developers' perspective, we benefited from the close collaboration with the discipline teachers throughout the proces of course revamp and implementation. By inviting them to be participants in our research, we also engaged in dialogue which strengthened our understanding of each other's pedagogy and built mutual trust and respect. Such a close collaoration and research initiative enabled EsAP course developers like us to identify teaching content which addres students' needs in disciplinary learning. Based on the voices of students and discipline teachers, we understood how the SHS students benefited from the ESAP course in their disciplinary learning. We also learned from what went wrong (e.g., students' lack of motivation in completing Moodle tasks, students valuing teacher feedback over per feedback) to further revamp the ESAP course for students' bettr learning.

While the revamp of this ESAP course was a response to the introduction of PBL in the SHS discipline, we understand that not al ESAP course situations are like the one we described. However, our experience has led us to believe that there is value in considering fliped learning and peer fedback in ESAP courses, particularly when such courses support students' leaning in disciplines that emphasise selfdiretd leing , PL). Rlt onh til plemention f flid g, hweer, stnts we etical si th were used to the techer-entred approach in scondry chool. We highlighted the extations and bneits f flipped aning, with xamples of successul implementations in similar educational contexts. Despite these effrts, the uptake was lessrobust than anticipated, as indicated by mixed student feedback and varying levels of engagement. Based on these experiences, we plan to include more support mechanisms in the future, such as multimedia resources to facilitate thir out-of-clas learning, ongoing dialogue through interactive forums to address any challenges students face, and regular check-in to monitor student learning progress out-of-class.

The close mapping between demands for ESAP and the entire disciplinary curriculum not only benefits students from interacting with the subject-related source texts provided by the discipline teachers, but aso transfers learned academic literacy from one context to another (Hirvela, 2016; James, 2014). ESAP course developers, teachers and students are taking on new roles in ESAP course development, teaching and learning and should acknowledge themselves as learners who are able to acquire the competences necessary in curriculum reform. ESAP course developers and teachers should have an inquisitive mind in what is necessary in their students learning. There is no one-size-fits-all pedagogical approach, and ESAP course developers need to be responsive to the ever-changing teaching contexts and students diverse earning needs. An implication is to encourage professional development among ESAP course developers and teachers to understand students' needs in different disciplines and investigate how their expertise in anguageteaching can be utilised to sustain students disciplinary learning. Pedagogicall, SAP teachers should explore ways to make learning motivating and engaging, for example, by designing meaningful tass and materials, enriching students' learning experience, establishing relationships of mutual respect and trust with and among the students and making learning enjoyable. Institutionall, ESAP course developers should seek opportunities to showcase the success of the course to discipline teachers so that the collective effort can be appreciated.

While it i necessary for ESAP course developers to understand students' needs and discipline teachers' beliefs, ESAP teachers are not playing a subordinating role to support what discipline teachers think is the best. On the contrary, ESAP teachers and discipline teachers need to respect and accept each other's specialist expertise (Wilkinson, 2018) SAP teaching and learning plays acrucial role in disciplinary learning. There are inevitably challenges in course development and implementation. However, with the support from discipline teachers and resources provided by institutions (e.g. funding support for teaching development and practitioner-based research), these challenges can be turned into opportunities. This paper callsfor recognition of the values of EsAP and active engagement from different stakeholders such as ESAP course developers and interdisciplinary cholars in promoting best practice in pedagogical innovations for effective disciplinary learning in higher education.
