# ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY Received 24 August 2021 Accepted 04 May 2022

Early identification of language delay is important as it has a serious impact on a child’s life in terms of educational, social, and emotional development. Among the early language screening tools, there are some parentadministered tools; however, they are not culturally appropriate or freely available. This article documents the development and preliminary validation of a quick and easy-to-administer language screening tool for babies from 6 to 18 months of age. Parents of 100 babies ranging in age from 6 to 21 months were included in the study. The babies were classified into five screening levels according to their age. The items of a Screening Test of Early Language Development-Test version (STELD-T) were created and validated through expert opinion. The STELD-T was administered along with the Receptive Expressive Emergent Language Scale (REELS). Internal consistency using the Kuder-Richardson Formula-20 ranged from 0.457 to 0.853 across the five levels, acceptable owing to short tool length and item heterogeneity. Kappa coefficients indicated 0.459 to 0.875 agreement between the STELD-T and the REELS indicated satisfactory criterion validity. After calculating the percentage of babies with a “refer” result as well as Kappa statistics with three different pass-refer criteria, a pass-refer criterion of $7 5 \%$ seemed to be appropriate for screening. The STELD seems to be a reliable and valid tool to screen language development in babies from 6 months to 18 months of age in urban areas of Maharashtra. Items representing a range of language skills including pragmatics make it a unique tool.

# 1. Introduction

Language development is a critical part of a child’s overall development. It acts as a strong base for communication. Spoken language, written language, and their associated components (i.e., receptive and expressive) are each a synergistic system comprised of individual language domains (i.e., phonology, lexicon, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) that form a dynamic integrative whole (Gleason 2005).

# 1.1. Language development in the early years of life

Language development in the first few months of life is primarily observable by the emergence of sounds and gestures. An infant’s initial experiments with vocalizations present as babbling, a critical milestone for speech development (Owens 2012). A continuous inflow of language from the parent or caregiver culminates in the infant recognizing words between the ages of 7 and 12 months. Between 8 and 12 months, the infant rapidly progresses to the stage of echolalia—imitation of the speech and communicative gestures of adults and older children. The occurrence of first meaningful words can be traced around the age of 12 months. Development of semantics—or meaningful use of language—thus originates before the first year itself. Two-word combinations typically develop by the age of 18 months marking beginnings of the development of syntax. In the period from 7 to 15 months, a child also demonstrates communicative pointing and gesturing; skills that are closely linked to social understanding and pragmatic development in later stages (Camaioni et al. 2004; Carpendale & Carpendale 2010). In other words, the first 18 months of life signify a phase of rapid development across multiple domains.

# 1.2. Impact of delayed language development

Delayed language development is common and has a serious impact on adulthood in terms of educational, social, and emotional development. Restricted early vocabulary and protracted expressive language development are typically considered hallmarks of late talking (Roos & Weismer 2008). Girolametto et al. (2001) investigated the long-term language outcomes of children identified as late talkers at 2 years of age. Results indicated that the performance of the late talking group was significantly lower in the various domains of language.

Children’s language development lays the foundation for their literacy development (Reese, Sparks & Levya 2010). Rescorla (2016) carried out a longitudinal study that included late-talking toddlers who were identified between 24 and 31 months of age. The study revealed that these children had significantly lower reading and writing abilities at 17 years of age. Charman et al. (2015) compared emotional and behavioral problems in children with language impairment (LI) and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A teacher-reported questionnaire called the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administered to a sample of 5- to 13-year-old children with LI $N = 6 2 { \cdot }$ ) and children with ASD $( N = 4 2$ ). Both groups of children show elevated levels of emotional and behavioral problems. Sim et al. (2013) administered the SDQ, the abbreviated Sure Start Language Measure, and a two-item language screen on 486 children who visited health-care centers at the age of 30 months. This resulted in identification of language and socialemotional difficulties in a significant proportion of children even in those who were considered at low risk.

It is therefore crucial to identify children with delays in language development as early as possible to reduce the negative impact that it might have on academic, behavioral, and socioemotional development and to ensure a good quality of life (Landa 2018). However, screening tools currently available to assess language skills for children between 0 and 2 years of age present with certain limitations.

# 1.3. Status of early language screening in India

Poor parental knowledge of language milestones prevents them from seeking necessary help in time. A study from Tamil Nadu done by Karuppannan et al. (2020) revealed that that the level of maternal knowledge about child developmental milestones in Kanchipuram was relatively low. Among the developmental milestones, the lowest level of knowledge was found for physical and language milestones. Kale (2020) explored parental knowledge of language milestones in babies aged 6 months to 21 months and concluded that there was an urgent need to educate both mothers and fathers about language development in the first two years of life.

In India as in other developing countries, physical health and well-being are often prioritized over developmental surveillance. This might reflect in poor parental motivation for visiting a speechlanguage clinic or in cases of lengthy assessment procedures, resistance to a second visit for completion of assessment. Although parents might regularly visit pediatricians for vaccinating their babies, very few pediatricians focus on developmental surveillance during vaccination visits (Fischer, Morris & Martines 2014). As the doctor to patient ratio in India is low (Deo 2013), administration of a detailed language assessment instrument might not be time-effective.

# 1.4. Review of presently available screening tools and their limitations

A review of the presently available screening tools reveals that each comes with its own set of limitations. ComDEALL (Karanth 2007) covers eight developmental domains—gross motor skills, fine motor skills, activities of daily living, receptive language age, expressive language age, cognitive skills, social skills, and emotional skills—for children in the age range of 0 to 6 years. However, a drawback of this checklist is that each assessment level consists of a very limited number of tasks for assessing an age span of as large as six years.

The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ; Squires, Bricker & Potter 1997) is a developmental screening tool designed to be used by the early educators and health-care professionals. In addition to detecting a child’s strengths and concerns, it also highlights results that fall in a “monitoring zone” to make it easier to keep track of children at risk (Singh,Yeh & Blanchard 2017). It has three domains out of which two domains cannot be assessed independently by an SLP. It has task-based questions in which parents need to perform a task before responding. It has culture-specific tasks and cannot be used in its present form in the Indian scenario.

The Language Evaluation Scale Trivandrum (LEST; Nair et al. 2016) has been standardized in Trivandrum and has 33 test items, and the test is compared separately for each year against the original Receptive Expressive Emergent Language Scale (REELS; Bzoch & League 1971). It is a valid Indian tool for identifying children of 0–3 years with language delay in the community with an acceptable sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and likelihood ratios. However, it is only available in the Malayalam language at the present time.

Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Screening Test (3rd ed.) are used to screen infants and toddlers at risk for developmental delay. Through cognitive, language, and motor domains, they facilitate quick examination of all facets of a young child’s development (Bayley 2005). However, similar in structure to the ASQ, they cannot be used independently by an SLP and have task-based questions in which parents have to perform the task before responding. In addition, the tasks may not be specific to the Indian sociocultural scenario.

The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDIs) (Fenson et al. 2007) are a set of parent report instruments that collect information about children’s developing abilities in early language, including vocabulary, comprehension, production, gestures, and grammar. They are filled out by the parents or caregivers of young children by indicating which list of words and/or sentences their child understands and/or produces. Parents are asked to choose the responses from a prespecified list of words and/or sentences. However, administration of these could be time consuming. According to Mayor & Mani (2019), these have limited use in clinical settings, multilingual environments, or when parents have low literacy skills. The tool is not freely available.

The Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP-IT-Checklist) was developed by Prizant & Wetherby (2002). It comprises three domains: social composite (emotion and eye gaze, communication, gestures), speech composite (sounds and words), and symbolic composite (understanding and object use). It can be administered by parents or caregivers on children from 6 to 24 months of age. However, items pertaining to social skills as well as language usage would be highly culture specific, so the tool cannot be used in India.

The Language Assessment Tool developed by the National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (Divyangjan), Secunderabad (2016) is a checklist for collecting information regarding speech and language development. It is freely available on Vikaspedia which is an online information guide launched by the Government of India. The checklist contains two domains of language—receptive and expressive. Each domain contains items pertaining to language development between 0 and 36 months. However, the number of items is very limited (31 items across 36 months) for the age range targeted. Also there are no explicit scoring or screening criteria given for the tool.

# 1.5. Need for a quick and easy-to-administer tool

The status of language screening in India not only presents an urgent need for a language screening tool in general but specifically one that does not take very long to administer. If such a screening tool is also easy for other professionals or parents to understand, it could enable parents to keep track of their child’s development under the supervision of a paediatrician or an SLP. This could receive greater acceptance by parents compared to a clinical language assessment, which is time-consuming and expensive (Sache & Von Suchodoletz 2008), while simultaneously increasing parental awareness of early language milestones. An additional benefit would be an increase in efficiency of screening despite a low doctor-patient ratio (Deo 2013).

In-clinic assessments can have some drawbacks like poor compliance or an inaccurate representation of actual language corpus that a child might produce. In such circumstances, parent-reported tools can provide reliable results based on which the child can be assessed further if necessary. Sachse & Von Suchodoletz (2008) compared the accuracy and diagnostic power of a parent-report measure for early identification of language delay. The parent language report and direct language measures were compared for 47 typically developing toddlers and 70 late-talking toddlers aged 24 to 26 months. One year later, language abilities of 102 of the 117 children were reassessed. The concurrent validity of the parent report was high both for judging language skills and for identifying language delay. No evidence was found of differences in the rating accuracy of mothers with different educational levels. The results suggested that when the professional wants to assess productive language abilities and identify language delay in 2-yearold toddlers, a parent language report proved to be a valid and efficient tool. The measurement characteristics of the parent report were comparable with those of direct language measures.

Involving parents in the initial screening process could also be instrumental in increasing their potential participation in therapy (Glascoe & Leew 2010) and consequently contribute to the success of therapy (Rikhy et al. 2010).

# 1.6. Psychometric evaluation of a screening tool

To establish its clinical applicability, the tool must satisfy psychometric criteria like acceptable reliability as well as construct and criterion validity. A screening tool usually elicits responses to statements in the form of a “yes” or a “no” response. In such cases, KR-20 serves as a measure of internal consistency and reliability in place of Cronbach’s alpha (Anselmi, Colledani & Robusto 2019). Suddaby (2010) suggested that researchers should take the opinion from experts to fill the gaps in the instrument that is being developed so as to increase the tool’s construct validity. As the results of screening are usually in the form of categorical data, the Kappa coefficient can be a good measure of criterion validity. It measures the degree to which the tool being evaluated agrees with a preestablished gold standard. In the absence of such a gold standard, a near perfect gold standard can be acceptable (Nair et al. 2016). The Receptive Expressive Emergent Language Scale (REELS; Bzoch & League 1971), which tests language from 0 to 3 years, has similarly been used as a near perfect gold standard in other studies in India. The REELS is a test to identify young children who are acquiring language at a delayed pace and determine if there is a discrepancy between receptive and expressive processes of emergent language. It lists language skills that a child must acquire between the ages of 0 to 3 years. The entire age range is divided into smaller ranges of 2 to 3 months. If a child seems to have mastered more than $5 0 \%$ of the language skills listed within a particular age range based on in-clinic observations and parental report, the therapist continues to assess higher age ranges until less than $5 0 \%$ skills are seen. The child’s receptive or expressive age is estimated to be within the highest age range where more than $5 0 \%$ skills were present. Nair et al. (2016) used REELS as a near perfect gold standard to obtain criterion validity while developing the LEST. The present study presented with a similar scenario. At the time of data collection, no language assessment tool for 0–2 years of age with an indigenous normative was available to the researchers. The REELS was thus used as the closest approximate.

As developmental red flags have a high likelihood of being noticed during regular vaccination visits, an ideal screening tool could have screening levels placed at 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, and 21 months so as to ensure that almost no baby with even a minor language delay goes undetected. Items in each screening level can be placed in such a way that they represent milestones achieved approximately 3 months before the age level being tested, thus accounting for an allowable range of $\pm \nobreakspace 3 \nobreakspace$ months before diagnosing a “delay” (Madhu et al. 2009).

The preceding review of existing literature reveals the need for a language screening tool for the first two years of life that is extremely critical to optimal academic, socioemotional, and behavioral development of a child. The tool must represent syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic development as a child rapidly makes progress in all these domains in this period. It must be easy to understand and quick to administer, so as to lend itself to administration by parents, paediatricians, or SLPs. It must also have satisfactory reliability as well as construct and criterion validity. The present work documents the construction and psychometric evaluation of a tool for screening babies aged 6 months to 21 months for possible delays in language development.

# 2. Method

The study was carried out in accordance with established ethical guidelines and duly approved by the Ethics Committee of the institution to which the second author is affiliated. It was divided into three phases. The items of the screening tool were finalized in the first phase; the preliminary version of the constructed tool was administered to 100 participants in the second phase; and the third phase included various analyses of the tool to ascertain its statistical properties.

# 2.1. Tool construction

As mentioned in the introduction, a tool for language screening between the ages of 6 and 21 months must include items reflective of a range of domains of language development including pragmatics. The first step toward tool construction involved creation of an item pool of 78 items to represent language development in various realms. The item pool was created by the first author after reviewing texts on language development (Hegde 1995; Lahey 1988; Reed 1974), research papers exploring language development in the early years (Amidon & Heistad 1985; Aylward 2009); Rabiah 2012), and existing tools in the form of tests, scales, and checklists for assessing language development, like the 3-Dimensional Language Acquisition Test (Herlekar & Karanth 1993), Pragmatic Language Assessment Guidelines (Marasco et al. 2004), and the Pragmatics Profile of Everyday Communication Skills in Children (Dewart & Summers 1995).

To ensure detection of red flags in language development by pediatricians among babies whose parents might have missed detecting them, the screening levels were set at 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, and 21 months, coinciding with regular vaccination visits. As per the rationale mentioned in the previous section, items in each screening level represented milestones achieved approximately three months before the age level being tested. The items in the item pool were initially sorted into screening levels by the first author. The validity of this classification was further verified by two independent judges who were SLPs with over 10 years of clinical and research experience. The judges also classified the items within each screening level along different domains of language.

As the tool was meant for use by professionals who might not belong to the speech and hearing field, or even by parents, the items needed to be unambiguous in terms of their meaning as well as easy to understand.

The judges were asked to place a check mark against the items they would choose for one of six screening levels—6–9 months, 9–12 months, 12–15 months, 15–18 months, and 18–21 months. The items for which both judges reached a consensus in terms of the inclusion of the item, the age range in which it was to be included, the language domain it tested, and item clarity and simplicity were included in the tool. The initial item pool given to judges for evaluation has been reproduced in Appendix A.

Any discrepancies in categorization for the items shortlisted to be included in the screening tool were discussed between the judges and resolved. Modifications and changes were made to the tool based on the feedback and suggestions received from the judges. Table 1 depicts the details of changes made to the tool after validation by the judges.

A total of 42 items were selected and three items were added as per the suggestions of the two experts, one at the 6–9 months screening level, one at the 15–18 months screening level, and one at the 18–21 months screening level. The total number of items was 45. These 45 items were unequally distributed among the five screening levels. This preliminary version of the screening tool was called Screening Test of Early Language Development- Test version (STELD-T).

The STELD-T thus consisted of five screening levels. Level I (6 to 9 months), Level II (9 to 12 months), Level III (12 to 15 months), Level IV (15 to 18 months), and Level V (18 to 21 months). STELD-T was constructed in the English language as the gold standard (REELS) used for criterion validity is available in English.

# 2.2. Participants

The STELD-T was administered to parents of 100 babies with their informed consent. All participants hailed from the Pune region of the state of Maharashtra, India. They ranged in age from 6 to 21 months (mean age $= 1 3 . 2 8 $ months; $S D = 4 . 1 9 ,$ ). Ninety-five of the babies had languages with a Devanagari script—Marathi $( N = 7 5 )$ ) and Hindi $( N = 2 1$ )—as their first language. The first language was Malayalam $N = 2 ,$ ), Kannada $( N = 1 )$ ), Tulu $( N = 1 )$ ), and English $( N = 1 )$ ) for five of the babies.

Table 2. Mean and SD of age across babies screened at one of the five levels.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>STELD-T screening level</td><td>Number of babies</td><td> Mean age</td><td> SD for age</td></tr><tr><td>I (6-9 months)</td><td>20</td><td>7.65</td><td>0.812</td></tr><tr><td>II (9-12 months)</td><td>20</td><td>10.05</td><td>0.686</td></tr><tr><td>III (12-15 months)</td><td>20</td><td>13.45</td><td>0.604</td></tr><tr><td>IV (15-18 months)</td><td>20</td><td>16.1</td><td>0.911</td></tr><tr><td>V (18-21 months)</td><td>20</td><td>19.15</td><td>1.039</td></tr></table></body></html>

Among both parents, the parent who spent a relatively greater amount of time with the child served as the respondent. Out of 100 parents, three of the respondents were fathers and 97 were mothers. All respondents had completed their graduation through an English medium of instruction and were able to comfortably understand, read, and speak English. The babies were divided into five age groups according to the five screening stages; each group comprised of 20 babies. For instance, a baby who was older than 6 months of age but younger than or equal to 9 months of age was evaluated using Screening Level I (6–9 months). No specific exclusion criterion was employed for selection of the babies. All the babies included in the study belonged to families who were at least bilingual (e.g., Marathi and Hindi, Marathi and English, Hindi and English, Kannada and English, etc.) and at most trilingual. Table 2 shows the mean and SD values of age of the babies screened using each of the five screening levels of the STELD-T.

# 2.3. Procedure

After obtaining informed consent, a detailed case history was taken to ensure adherence to the inclusion criteria of the study as well as to elicit important developmental information. This included demographic details; medical history; prenatal, natal, and postnatal history of the child consisting of motor and speech and language milestones; and time spent by the reporting parent. The case history form can be referred to in Appendix B. Table 3 shows demographic details of the participants.

This was followed by administration of the STELD-T. Parents were asked to select the items pertaining to milestones that were achieved by their child by placing a tick mark against the relevant item. Although the STELD-T was administered in English, parents used the native language as a reference while making a decision about whether their baby demonstrated a particular language skill. The REELS was administered by the first author to evaluate the development of the first language independently from the STELD-T to ascertain criterion validity. As mentioned in the Introduction, the REELS yields a receptive and an expressive language age, which are continuous variables. An average “language age” of these two values was therefore calculated for the purpose of the present study. For a child who had a language age within a range of $\pm \nobreakspace 3 \nobreakspace$ months of chronological age, the data point was coded as “pass” (Madhu et al. 2009); the child with a language age lower than the chronological age by 3 months or more was coded as “refer.” For dichotomizing data in the form of total scores on the STELD-T, a pass-refer criterion of greater than $7 5 \%$ was considered. The resultant categorical data were then used for statistically evaluating agreement between the STELD-T and the REELS.

\*Some participants might have belonged to more than one category. Such participants have been counted twice, which explains a total frequency greater than 100.

# 2.4. Statistical analysis

Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) coefficient was calculated to check internal consistency between the items. To ascertain if a pass-refer criterion of $7 5 \%$ was appropriate, the data were also dichotomized using two other pass-refer criteria of $7 0 \%$ and $8 0 \%$ . The agreement between the two tools for each pass-refer criterion was then assessed using the Kappa coefficient.

# 3. Results

As the present study was a preliminary exploration involving babies with no specific language-related complaints, all of the babies showed responses present for some items of the STELD. As a result, these items showed zero variance and could not be subject to analysis for computing the KR-20 coefficient. This was also observed for Levels I and III when a lax $( 7 0 \% )$ pass-refer criterion was applied while calculating Kappa coefficients. Descriptive statistics in terms of number of babies who passed the screening at each of the five levels with different pass-refer criteria can be seen in Table 4. Values in parentheses next to each frequency indicate the cutoff score for that screening level at that particular pass-refer criterion.

# 3.1. Level I

Level I consisted of a total of seven items. A reliability analysis revealed that the KR-20 coefficient for Level I was 0.088. Item-total statistics for items 3, 6, and 7 were analyzed as variance was obtained for these three items. Out of these three items, item 6 showed a negative item-total correlation as well as a negative correlation with other items of that screening level. Item-total statistics for Level I can be seen in the Appendix C (i).

Deleting item 6 significantly improved the KR-20 value to 0.457 indicative of fairly acceptable reliability (Miller, Linn & Gronlund 2009; Taber et al. 2018). As a result, item 6 was removed from the tool. Item 6’s statement—“If your baby is crying, does he/she quiet down upon hearing familiar voices?”—was intended to represent the construct “pragmatics.” However, if analyzed closely, it could also be considered as an item that referred to the child’s auditory skills. Based on the content of the item as well as statistical analyses, item 6 was removed from the tool. Kappa coefficient for Level I after removing item 6 was found to be 0.459 $( p = . 0 1 5 )$ indicative of moderate strength of agreement value (Landis & Koch 1977; Sim & Wright 2005) with REELS. This result may however be considered acceptable as the STELD-T had many items pertaining to pragmatic skills. REELS, which was used for absence of a better gold standard, has a relatively lesser focus on pragmatics as compared to other language domains. Thus, Kappa value was deemed acceptable and significant for Level I.

# 3.2. Level II

Level II consisted of 10 items. KR-20 coefficient for Level II was found to be 0.783. Item-total statistics for items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10 were analyzed as there was variance in outcomes of the screening tool across babies for these eight items. Item-total statistics for Level II can be seen in the Appendix C (ii).

Internal consistency for Level II was 0.783 indicative of “fairly high reliability” (Taber 2018). Item-total statistics revealed that items 8 and 10 had poor item to total correlation (Appendix C [ii]). Deletion of these items would increase the KR-20 value to 0.813, indicative of very good reliability. However, both item 8 (“Does your child react appropriately to emotions? [E.g., cries when you make an angry face])” and item 10 (“Does your child respond consistently whenever his/her own name is called?”) were related to the pragmatic aspect of communication. Since one of the aims of the study was to develop a tool that adequately represents language in all its domains including pragmatics, it would be beneficial to retain this item. In addition, retaining items pertaining to pragmatics would increase the utility of the STELD for early detection of ASD. Similar findings were found in a study where most mothers identified early signs of ASD before their baby was 18 months of age (McConkey, Truesdale-Kennedy & Cassidy 2009). This made it important to retain items that refer to pragmatics even though most typically developing children or even children with hearing impairment or specific language impairment might pass on these items. The tool could thus be used to detect early discrepancies in pragmatic abilities. The Kappa coefficient was 0.643 $( p = . 0 0 2 )$ indicative of substantial strength of agreement (Landis & Koch 1977; Sim & Wright 2005) of Level II of STELD-T with REELS.

# 3.3. Level III

Level III consisted of seven items. Internal consistency for Level III was 0.727, indicative of good reliability (Taber 2018). The corrected item to total correlation value of the two items that showed variance was 0.577 (Appendix C [iii]), which was greater than 0.3. Thus these items were therefore retained in the final version of the tool.

The Kappa coefficient was 0.500 $( p = . 0 1 0 )$ , suggestive of moderate strength of agreement (Landis & Koch 1977; Sim & Wright 2005). This, in other words, meant that there was fairly good agreement between the Level III of STELD-T and REELS.

# 3.4. Level IV

Level IV consisted of seven items. Item-total statistics for items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were analyzed as variance was obtained for these five items. Out of these five items, for item 2, corrected item-total correlation was obtained to be 0.173. Deleting the item would increase the KR-20 value to 0.696 from an original value of 0.665 (adequate reliability). Also, this item did not show a negative correlation with other items (Appendix C [iv]). Thus, item 2—“Does your child understand Wh-questions like ‘Where is mommy?’ and respond to it by pointing or looking at the place/object?”—was retained in the tool.

Cohen’s Kappa coefficient for Level IV with a $7 5 \%$ pass-refer criterion was found to be 0.875 and statistically significant $\left( p < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , suggesting almost perfect strength of agreement (Landis & Koch 1977; Sim & Wright 2005) between Level IV of STELD-T and REELS.

# 3.5. Level V

Level V consisted of 14 items. Internal consistency for Level V was 0.853, which indicated high reliability (Taber 2018). Out of these 13 items, for item 11 corrected item-total correlation was 0.66. Deleting this item would increase the KR-20 value to 0.862 (Appendix C [v]). Thus, item

11 could be retained in the tool, and deleting this item would not result in any substantial increase in KR-20 value. Also this item assessed the construct pragmatics and needed to be retained.

The Kappa coefficient value was 0.773 $\left( p < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , which was suggestive of substantial agreement (Landis & Koch 1977; Sim & Wright 2005) of STELD-T with REELS.

# 3.6. Pass-refer criterion

Westerlund, Berglund & Eriksson (2006) stated that a sensitivity of $5 0 \%$ was not enough to identify severe language delay, and a stricter criterion resulted in too many false positives. In the present study, a pass-refer criterion of $7 5 \%$ seemed to produce favorable results. This was probably because of the way the items were placed into each level to allow for a $\pm 3$ -month variation. Another way to verify the pass-refer criterion given the limited data points in the present study was to vary the pass-refer criterion and check the outcomes. Thus two other levels— $7 0 \%$ and $8 0 \%$ —were chosen. Table 5 displays Kappa coefficients for each of the five levels for the three pass-refer criterion. Kappa coefficients could not be calculated for Level I and III for the $7 0 \%$ criterion because all babies tested at these Levels using a $7 0 \%$ criterion received a result of “pass,” resulting in zero variance for the STELD-T outcomes.

In other words, a $7 0 \%$ pass-refer criterion led to all babies receiving a “pass” result at Level I and III, or in other words, decreased sensitivity. An $8 0 \%$ pass-refer criterion led to an increase in the number of “refer” results (Table 4), reducing specificity. It also led to a reduction in the Kappa coefficient for Level $\mathrm { V }$ (Table 5). A $7 5 \%$ criterion was thus finalized as a pass-refer criterion for the final version of the STELD-T, called the STELD.

# 3.7. Effect of the first language on results

It must be noted that although 95 of the 100 babies had languages that were represented by a Devanagari script (Marathi or Hindi) as their first language, five of the babies had Dravidian languages $\left( N = 4 \right)$ ) or English $( N = 1 )$ ) as their first language. To account for the difference in grammatical structure of sentences in Marathi/Hindi versus other languages, the data from 95 babies were reanalyzed separately, considering the five babies who did not speak these languages, as outliers. However, this did not change any of the trends in results. Specifically, item 6 from Level I still showed a very low item-total correlation and needed to be removed. KR-20 values of all five screening levels were still within the “acceptable” range with statistically significant Kappa coefficient values. Table 6 displays the KR-20 and Kappa coefficient values after excluding the five data points of babies who did not speak languages that had a Devanagari script.

To study the variation of STELD total scores relative to REELS language age in further detail, the two variables were correlated to find Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. Correlation between both measures was found to be ${ > } 0 . 7$ and significant $\left( p < . 0 0 1 \right)$ for all five screening levels (Table 7).

# 4. Discussion

Language acquisition follows a universal pattern (Eigsti 2013). In other words, children develop language similarly across different languages and cultural contexts. Although different domains of language develop hand in hand, pragmatic development dominates approximately the first six months of life in the form of development of communicative intent and social interaction. This is followed by a relative spurt in the development of semantics as a child learns new words and their meanings at a rapid pace. Around 1 year of age and onwards, all three domains develop together, with a significant growth in sentence length and morphology (McLaughlin 2006). A look at the items within each screening level of the STELD reveals a gradual progression from a relatively higher proportion of items related to pragmatics in the first level to a large number of items depicting syntactic development in Level V (see Appendix A and Table 1). The STELD is thus in line with theories and data on language development. The fact that the results remained unchanged irrespective of whether babies with Dravidian languages were included or excluded from the analysis aligns with the universal nature of language development and language milestones in the early developmental period. A recent cross-sectional observational study by Ertem et al. (2018) analyzed language, gross motor, fine motor, social, play, and self-help-related milestones of children from birth to 3 years from four countries—Argentina, India, South Africa, and Turkey. The researchers found that language milestones were attained at nearly the same age irrespective of the languages spoken around the child. A similar study by Lansdown et al. (1996) across Thailand, China, and India found differences in attainment of milestones across urban and rural children but similar ages of attainment of milestones across countries, especially in the first year of life. The researchers suggested that this was probably because milestones in the early years largely depend on functional maturation and therefore might be language-independent. The results of the present study seem to reaffirm these findings in literature.

# 4.1. Structure and psychometric properties of the Screening Test of Early Language Development

As seen in the previous section, some of the items in the STELD-T appeared to have zero variance. Although it might be argued that this might be the result of a ceiling effect, or in other words, excessive simplicity of items, it must be noted that the said items would be essential to rule out problems in a child’s communicative intent. McConkey, Truesdale-Kennedy & Cassidy (2009) found that 47 of 49 parents of children with ASD used the words “delayed speech, lack of speech, slow speech development, no speech, speech was behind, did not speak much, could not speak, speech did not come.” Six parents specifically mentioned their child’s babble, such as the child not making sounds or his babble being gibberish. Five mentioned a lack of understanding such as the child not speaking or understanding. Three referred to a lack of communication such as the child does not communicate at all or no communication skills. Most mothers identified early signs of ASD before the child was 18 months of age. This made it important to retain items that refer to pragmatics in the STELD-T even though most typically developing children or even children with hearing impairment or specific language impairment might pass on these items. The tool could be used to detect early discrepancies in pragmatic abilities. Also, unlike an assessment tool, items of a screening tool must be distributed in such a way that the tool is both sensitive as well as specific. A few items therefore might refer to a skill that would be achieved by a majority of babies at a particular developmental stage.

Figure 1 shows KR-20 coefficients for all the five levels. Combining the information from the graph with the data on the number of items in each screening level, it appears that these coefficients might be a function of the length of a tool. Streiner, Norman & Cairney (2015) stated that increase in the number of items on a scale will lead to greater reliability. There is a positive relation between the number of items and reliability coefficients. In other words, a smaller number of items lead to lower Cronbach’s alpha coefficients (Abdelmoula, Chakroun & Akrout 2005). Similarly in Level I, a smaller number of items (six items) possibly resulting in low KR-20 low values as compared to other levels of the screening tool were observed.

Reliability coefficients also bear a direct relationship with sample size (Duhachek, Coughlan & Iacoubucci 2005) and an inverse relationship with heterogeneity of items, which occurs when multiple constructs are being measured. In the present study, however, KR-20 values indicated fair to good reliability for all five screening levels despite having a sample size, a short length of the tool, and heterogeneity of items. The results could thus be considered acceptable.

![](img/28327dd70007dbecd94e392cab8b5536a16c22d98e0137be03fb55463e7f644e.jpg)  
KR-20 Coefficient   
Figure 1. KR-20 coefficients for the five levels of screening.

Thus, all these factors that are likely to decrease Cronbach’s alpha or in this case, KR-20 values, were positive for the present study. Each level in the STELD-T had fewer than 20 items. The sample size per level was 20. In addition, the STELD-T had items representing different constructs, or in other words, different language domains. Despite this, KR-20 values were consistently more than 0.45 for all the Levels. Levels with more items predictably reflected a higher KR-20 value.

The strength of agreement between REELS and the STELD-T for Level I (after modification) and for Levels II through V ranged from moderate to substantial levels. Acceptable Kappa values implied that there was an association between STELD-T (even after modification) and REELS for each of five screening levels. In line with the fact that pragmatic development dominates a large part of the first year of life (Airenti 2017), the STELD gave relatively more importance to pragmatic development in the first screening level as compared to REELS. This might be one of the reasons why the agreement between the two tools was relatively lower for Level I data. In other words, a child who might have a “pass: result after dichotomizing REELS scores might get a “refer” result on STELD owing to poor pragmatic development. However, overall, STELD total scores seemed to closely and reliably reflect the extent of a child’s language development, as was apparent from the correlation between STELD total scores with language age as obtained on REELS (Table 7). This finding in addition to acceptable Kappa coefficients reaffirms criterion validity of the STELD (Albano 2018).

The distribution of items allowing for a three-month lag with reference to the chronological age balanced with a strict pass-refer criterion (Westerlund, Berglund & Eriksson 2006) would ensure that the STELD does not overestimate or underestimate the occurrence of language delays. The number of babies who got a “refer” result with a $7 5 \%$ pass-refer criterion (based on Table 4) agrees with existing data on prevalence of language disorders (Abraham et al. 2014).

With findings indicative of satisfactory reliability and criterion validity, the STELD is likely to “catch” babies with suspected language delays.

# 4.2. The Screening Test of Early Language Development in contrast to other tools

The STELD is thus a language screening tool with five screening levels and a $7 5 \%$ pass-refer criterion. It must also be noted that the language used in the items was very simple to understand based on the opinions of both expert judges. This would increase the applicability of the tool in that it may be used even as a pediatrician-administered or parent-administered screening tool (Abdoola 2015). It adequately represents the pragmatic domain of language (Appendix A) and might potentially be useful for detecting early signs of ASD and other disorders that affect pragmatics. In contrast to tools like the ASQ (Squires, Bricker & Potter 1997) or the Language Evaluation Scale Trivandrum (Nair et al., 2016), the nature of items was not task-oriented. It would take lesser time to administer than other tools like the COMM-DEALL (Karanth 2007). This would make responding to each item quicker and more convenient for the parent, the pediatrician, or the SLP.

The findings from Tables 5 and 6 indicate that irrespective of the first language of a child, the STELD yields reliable and valid results. This is in line with the words of Eigsti (2013:2) stating, “ . . . it is remarkable how uniform the process of acquisition is. It follows a similar developmental progression across children, despite quite striking differences in the structure of the language being learned, culture . . . and so on.” A probable reason for these findings could also be that language development until 18 months would involve primarily two-word combinations (McLaughlin 2006), a more complex and language-specific syntactic structure setting in after this age. For example, the question “Does your child use combination of gestures and words?” (Screening Level III, Appendix A) could be applicable to a child speaking in any language. The present version of the STELD could this be used to screen babies irrespective of their first language provided the reporting parent can read and respond in English.

# 4.3. Additional utility of the Screening Test of Early Language Development

The first three years of life are crucial, as the brain rapidly develops and is able to learn new information. If this critical period passes without adequate interaction and opportunity for language development, it becomes more challenging to accomplish the milestones as the child develops (Evans & Shaw 2008; Ramirez, Lytle & Kuhl 2020). Parental awareness of language milestones in the first two years has been found to be poor in India (Kale 2020; Karuppannan et al. 2020). Screening for developmental milestones has been known to improve parental involvement in language stimulation and, potentially in some cases, intervention (Nelson et al. 2011). Regular use of the STELD by pediatricians and SLPs and parents being encouraged to administer the STELD on their babies could thus be instrumental in improving knowledge of language milestones and participation in language stimulation by parents in the urban parts of Maharashtra.

# 5. Conclusion

The present study indicated that the STELD seems to have the potential to detect babies at risk for language delay between 6 months to 21 months of age in urban areas of Maharashtra. Early detection would make intervention an easier process for the child, the parent, and the SLP. Including a speech and language screening tool in the developmental pediatrician’s assessment battery would increase the likelihood of the SLP being involved in the intervention team at an early stage. Involving parents in the screening could sensitize them to their role in therapy, if therapy is deemed necessary for a child who is screened. The mere presence of such a tool could work toward building awareness among professionals and parents about the importance of speech and language stimulation for overall development.

The study did have its limitations. Restricting to the English language for the reporting parent inadvertently led to sampling of only the population from urban areas of Maharashtra. The nearest available gold standard was used in the study since no other available tool met the required age criteria for the present study. Although the data were examined thrice by applying three different pass-refer criteria $( 7 0 \% , 7 5 \%$ , and $8 0 \%$ ), a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was not computed because owing to the language of reporting being restricted to English, the researchers could not get a true cross-section of the Pune population. This sample distribution and the present sample size allowed only a small number of “refer” interpretations.

One of the steps to overcome these limitations would be to translate the STELD to different Indian languages. This would enable language screening of babies in the rural parts of India. In addition, the STELD in its present form can be used to collect data from urban areas of states other than Maharashtra and reassess its psychometric properties. Addition of data from across India would not only increase the external validity of the STELD but also enable additional statistical analyses like the ROC curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Finally, ensuring availability of the STELD to SLPs, pediatricians, and caregivers in different parts of the country could effectively facilitate early identification of language delays across India.
