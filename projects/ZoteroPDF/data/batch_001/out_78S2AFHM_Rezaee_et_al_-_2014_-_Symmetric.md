Collocational competence is recognized to be integral to native-like L2 performance, and concordancing can be of assistance in gaining this competence. This study reports on an investigation into the effect of symmetrical and asymmetrical scaffolding on the collocational competence of Iranian intermediate learners of English in the context of concordancing. It also surveys the learners' attitudes towards the role of concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations. Immediate and delayed posttests were administered to examine the effects of the treatments given over 10 sessions on L2 collocations in the receptive and productive tasks. Results demonstrated that the three groups of participants who received the treatment tasks in the context of concordancing under symmetrical, asymmetrical, and no-scaffolding conditions, improved their knowledge of collocations significantly both in the receptive and productive tasks compared to the control group which had no access to concordancing and did not receive scaffolding. However, there was no significant difference among the performances of the concordancing groups either in the receptive or in the productive tasks. Moreover, learners expressed positive attitudes towards both concordancing and scaffolding.

# Introduction

Research to date has indicated that the common errors committed by advanced L2 learners in the written mode of L2 production can be attributed to collocational errors (e.g., Bahns & Eldaw, 1993; Howarth, 1998; Nesselhauf, 2003). It has been argued that advanced learners' ability in using L2 collocations lags well behind their ability to use grammar and vocabulary (e.g., Wray, 2002). To achieve native-like competence, L2 learners have to develop collocational competence in addition to other components of language competence (e.g., Hill, 1999). The term collocation refers to \*the natural co-occurrence of a string of words whose meaning is inferable from literal concepts" (Chan & Liou, 2005, p. 231). Collocations consist of two elements, the node and the collocate co-occurring with the node (Sinclair, 1991). The collocate carious, for example, co-occurs regularly with the node tooth, whereas its synonymy, addled, co-occurs with the node egg.

Different approaches have already been adopted to account for teaching collocations. Many studies (e.g., Sun & Wang, 2003) have highlighted the prominent influence of inductive approaches compared to the deductive ones on teaching L2 collocations. More recently, Web-based concordancing (WBC) has turned out to be one of the effective inductive techniques of teaching collocations (e.g., Chan & Liou, 2005; Wu, Witten, & Franken, 2010). WBC is a data-driven electronic program which provides a vast number of authentic sentences including L2 collocations. Concordancing provides learners with repeated exposures to collocations, on the one hand, and prompts L2 learners to use the collocations on the other. Such an engagement is likely to render the collocations salient for being noticed which in turn can enhance the chance of their being picked up by L2 learners (e.g., Wu et al., 2010).

Although WBC seems to be promising in developing collocational competence, having access to a huge amount of information in concordancing might make L2 learners feel isolated and fail to take advantage of the information autonomously (e.g., Sharma & Hannafin, 2007). Autonomous or self-regulated learning is argued to be a prerequisite for benefiting from computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in general and WBC in particular (e.g., Greene, Moos, & Azevedo, 2011). Learners have to bring prior knowledge, cognitive and metacognitive skills, and intrinsic motivation to CALL to self-regulate their learning. Learners do not usually possess enough capacity to self-regulate their learning and use the information provided in CALL effectively (e.g., Dignsth, Buettner, & Langfeldt, 2008).

Without the knowledge, skills, and motivation required, L2 learners are likely to experience confusion, cognitive demand, and distraction along with their learning process (e.g., Scheiter & Gerjets, 2007). As different studies have clearly indicated, learners often fail to self-regulate their learning effectively when they use CALL without scaffolding (e.g., Azevedo & Cromley, 2004). Therefore, scaffolding has been identified to be of essence in enhancing the benefit of CALL. Scaffolding is defined as "a process that enables a child or a novice to solve a problem, carry out a task or achieve a goal which would be beyond his or her unassisted efforts' (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976, p. 90).

Sharma and Hannafin (2007) identified hard scaffolding, i.e., a technology-mediated or tool-based scaffolding, and soft scaffolding, i.e., social face-to-face interaction involving either peer-peer or teacher-student scaffolding, to maximize learning opportunities in CALL. A number of researchers (e.g., Chang & Sun, 2009; Le, 2010) have examined the role of hard scaffolding in facilitating learners' use of concordancing in learning L2 collocations. Soft scaffolding, however, remains to be explored with respect to learning collocations in the context of concordancing where it is more likely to provide tailored and dynamic support and feedback. The present study examines the effect of symmetrical scaffolding, i.e., peer-peer support, and asymmetrical scaffolding, i.e., teacher-student support, on learning L2 collocations in the context of concordancing in receptive and productive measures. Furthermore, this study aims to investigate learners' attitudes towards using concordancing in learning L2 collocations and incorporating scaffolding as a mediating tool for enhancing self-regulated learning in the context of concordancing.

# Collocations

According to Benson, Benson, and Ilson (1997), collocations can be categorized as either grammatical or lexical. Grammatical collocations, which refer to the co-occurrence of content and function words, include preposition-noun (e.g., under suspicion), nounpreposition (e.g., objection against), adjective-preposition (e.g., jealous of), noun-to infinitive (e.g., a pleasure to do), noun-that clause (e.g., my suggestion that), adjective-to infinitive (e.g., ready to go), and adjective-that (e.g., sure that) collocations. Verb-preposition collocations (e.g., consist of), which were clearly traced among collocational errors of L2 learners (e.g., Liu, 2002), have to be added to the above list of collocations. Lexical collocations, however, relate to the co-occurrence of two content words and include verb-noun (e.g., administer an exam), adjective-noun (e.g., rancid butter), verb-adverb (e.g., disguise cleverly), noun-noun (e.g., a pack of lies), noun-verb (e.g., the bubble bursts), adjective-adverb (e.g., sound asleep), and adverb-adjective (e.g., totally haphazard) collocations.

Research to date has indicated that learners commit both lexical (e.g., Nesselhauf, 2003) and grammatical (e.g., Hill, 1999) collocational errors. Collocational errors can be partly explained by Skehan's (1998) dual processing system which claims that L2 learners rely more on the rule-governed system of the language than the exemplar-based one in their L2 production. Resorting to their rule-governed system, learners may produce L2 miscollocations. Achieving native-like competence then entails using those utterances that are "readily acceptable to native informants as ordinary, natural forms of expression, in -contrast to expressions that are grammatical but are judged to be 'unidiomatic', 'odd', or foreignisms" (Pawley & Syder, 1983, p. 193).

Over the last two decades four different lines of research focused on collocations using different techniques such as written data elicitation, explicit instruction, implicit instruction, and WBC which are touched upon briefly below.

# Eliciting written data

Bahns and Eldaw (1993) used a translation task and a cloze test to investigate productive knowledge of 15 verb-noun collocations. They divided 58 German advanced learners of English into two groups. The first group was required to perform a translation task and the second group was asked to do a cloze task. In an exploratory study, Nesselhauf (2003) examined written productive verb-noun collocations of 32 argumentative essays written by advanced German students of English. Findings of these studies indicated that even advanced learners' collocational competence lagged behind their vocabulary proficiency. To compensate for L2 learners' poor collocational knowledge, L2 teachers were advised to adopt some appropriate pedagogical strategies.

# Explicit and implicit instruction studies

Some researchers advocated the role of implicit learning in teaching L2 collocations and claimed that learners should be exposed to collocations in input so that through noticing (Schmidt, 1990) they could acquire collocational competence (e.g., Durrant & Schmitt, 2010; Webb, Newton, & Chang, 2013).

Webb et al. (2013) adopted an implicit approach to teach L2 collocations to 161 English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in Taiwan. Learners were divided into four experimental groups and a control group. The experimental groups were supposed to read a modified graded reader, including 18 collocations, and simultaneously listen to a recording under four conditions, 1 time, 5 times, 10 times, and 15 times exposure, respectively. The control group, however, had access to neither the graded reader nor the recorded listening. Results indicated that the second, third, and fourth experimental groups outperformed the first experimental group. Repetition was concluded to explain the significant improvements observed.

Some researchers (e.g., Tseng, 2002; Webb & Kagimoto, 2009), however, downplayed the role of implicit instruction in learning L2 collocations and placed premium upon explicit instruction. They argued that implicit learning of L2 collocations is a slow process which requires a large amount of input and exposure. Webb and Kagimoto (2009) explored the role of explicit learning on verb-noun collocations of 145 Japanese learners of English. Learners were divided into two experimental groups and a control group. The first experimental group was exposed to 12 sets of collocations followed by three glossed sentences. The second experimental group received the same sets of collocations along with their Japanese meanings followed by three sentences with blank spaces and was required to fill in the blanks. Webb and Kagimoto concluded that both the receptive and productive tasks were efficacious methods for teaching collocations.

Initial learning appears to be of paramount importance in turning uptake into intake and transferring knowledge to real-life situations. It is argued that "without an adequate level of initial learning, transfer cannot be expected' (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 1999, p. 41). To foster language learning, learners should experience iteration, i.e., \*the opportunity to revisit the same territory again and again' (Larsen-Freeman, 2013, p. 121), rather than repetition. Explicit and implicit teachings of collocations, however, do not seem to fulfill the requirements of iteration and transfer. Concordancing can trigger iteration by exposing learners to collocations in different expanded contexts and facilitate transfer and retrieval.

# WBC studies

The more recent body of research has demonstrated the positive influence of concordancing on learning L2 collocations (e.g., Chambers & O'Sullivan, 2004; Chang & Sun, 2009; Sun & Wang, 2003; Yeh, Liou, & Li, 2007). The positive influence reported might relate to the potentiality of concordancing in engaging all the three components (i.e., need, search, and evaluation) of Laufer and Hulstijn's (2001) involvement load hypothesis (ILH). Drawing upon Laufer and Hulstijn's (2001) ILH, Wu et al. (2010) argue that when learners are exposed to collocations repeatedly in concordancing or are involved in learning by themselves, they learn and retrieve collocations easily because collocational items possess high involvement load. The underlying components of ILH are assumed to be need, search, and evaluation. The need component is the motivational dimension of involvement which refers to the degree of necessity for a word in a given context. The search and evaluation components, however, are related to the cognitive dimension of involvement. The search component triggers finding the meaning of a word in a dictionary or asking the teacher for its meaning. The evaluation component calls for comparing one word with other words in terms of its fitness in a context.

Each of these components can be present or absent while processing a word. The degree of involvement depends on the presence of these three components. Those tasks which entail need, search, and evaluation possess higher levels of involvement which can result in better retention. In contrast, those tasks which do not trigger these components possess low levels of involvement which in turn lead to poor learning, if any. Concordancing possesses the capacity to involve all these components. It requires learners to write a collocate to a node (need), it urges learners to search the corpora and find the node (search), and finally it provides learners with the opportunity to compare some collocates and choose the one which best fits the context (evaluation). Learners' engagement with these three components of ILH in the context of concordancing is postulated to contribute to learning collocations (Wu et al., 2010).

A new line of research has set out to investigate the influence of scaffolding on facilitating the use of concordancing for learning L2 grammatical (e.g., Chang & Sun, 2009) and lexical (e.g., Le, 2010) collocations. Chang and Sun (2009), for instance, investigated the effect of concordancing and hard scaffolding on verb-preposition collocations of 26 Thai learners of English. Participants were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group. Both groups were required to complete four proofreading tasks by consulting a concordancer as the reference tool. The experimental group received procedural, elaborative, and reflective technology-based prompts written in learners' L1, prior to their task completion. In the procedural prompt, learners were guided to engage in problem-solving activities; in the elaborative prompt, learners' prior knowledge was triggered; and in the reflective prompt, learners' metacognitive awareness was raised. The control group, however, did not receive any scaffolding prompt. Results showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group even when the scaffolding prompts were removed.

Le (2010) conducted a similar study on lexical collocations of 20 Vietnamese intermediate learners of English and documented similar pattern of results. Although Chang and Sun (2009) and Le (2010) came up with the positive impact of hard scaffolding on learning L2 collocations, they assessed only the learners' receptive knowledge and did not address the role of collaboration and negotiation of meaning in written collocations. Moreover, the number of participants was limited which can be considered as a threat to the external validity of their findings.

# Scaffolding

The term scaffolding is closely related to the Vygotsky's (1987) zone of proximal development (ZPD) which refers to the distance between what a child can do dependently with the help/support of a parent and what s/he can do independently without the help/support of a parent. These concepts have been widely applied in settings well beyond child-parent dyads where groups of learners with varying abilities have replaced a child. As it stands out, applying the ZPD in educational settings can hardly prove to be free of serious problems simply because teachers commonly plan classroom activities for a group of learners rather than individuals (Mercer & Fisher, 1997).

The notions of scaffolding and ZPD primarily encapsulate asymmetrical scaffolding in teaching and learning. Vygotsky (1987) claimed that in a joint activity, an expert or a "more knowledgeable peer' should offer support to a novice to perform a task which is beyond his/her current level of ability. Some studies have reported the positive effect of asymmetrical scaffolding on learning L2 grammatical points (e.g., Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994), improving L2 writing (e.g., Woodward-Kron, 2007), reading the Web (e.g., Murray & McPherson, 2006), and learning L2 collocations (e.g., Le, 2010).

Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994) examined the influence of asymmetrical scaffolding on the development of four grammatical problems, i.e., articles, tense marking, prepositions, and modal verbs. Each session three learners read their essays and pinpointed any grammatical errors. The teacher-student pair then read the essay sentence by sentence. At times the teacher provided some prompts to push the learner towards self-correction. If the learner failed to self-correct the error, the teacher would correct it while providing explicit explanation. Aljaafreh and Lantolf developed five levels of scaffolding to move learners from other-regulation to self-regulation. Learners were provided with scaffolding to notice and correct the error (Levels 1-3). Little by little, the scaffolding was removed (Level 4), and ultimately the learners became independent and self-regulated (Level 5). They concluded that asymmetrical scaffolding made learners move from other-regulation which was provided by the teacher to self-regulation in which learners were able to identify and correct their errors.

Contrary to Vygotsky's asymmetrical scaffolding, Piaget (1926), advocating symmetrical scaffolding, argued that cognitive development is guaranteed when there is "little cognition and social distance between peers" (Gauvain, 2001, p. 60). In line with Piaget's view, some researchers claim that learning can also take place in collaboration with peers (e.g., Van Lier, 2004). Newman, Griffin, and Cole (1989) suggested reconceptualizing the notion of ZPD, arguing that it should also be applied to symmetrical scaffolding where peers can achieve the goals that seem difficult for them to accomplish without each other's support.

Ellis (1997) acknowledged that when peers are involved in managing the discourse, they are more concerned with rich negotiation of meaning compared to the situation when a native language speaker or an expert is responsible for discourse control. Van Lier (2004) is of view that the ZPD "must be expanded to include not only an expert-novice relationship, but also an equal peer one, a peer to lower-level peer one, and a selfaccess, self-regulated one"' (p. 162).

To date different studies have explored the influence of symmetrical scaffolding on foreign language development (e.g., Ohta, 1995), L2 written production (e.g., Guerrero & Villamil, 2000), L2 problem-solving tasks (e.g., Fernandez, Wegerif, Mercer, & RogasDrummond, 2001), and social interaction (e.g., Xu, Gelfer, & Perkins, 2005).

Like other components of language which have been reported to be acquired more effectively through collaboration and scaffolding, collocations might also be learned efficaciously while learners are deeply involved in collaboration and social interaction. Previous studies have left untouched, to our knowledge, both teacher-learner and peer-peer social interaction as well as comparing their differential influence on teaching L2 collocations in the context of concordancing. The present study explores the effect of both symmetrical and asymmetrical scaffolding on teaching L2 collocations in the context of concordancing. It also surveys the atitudes of learners towards the inclusion of concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations.

# Research questions

The following research questions guided the present study:

(1) Does concordancing improve Iranian intermediate learners' receptive and productive performances of L2 collocations?   
(2) What is the differential influence of the symmetrical and asymmetrical scaffolding on Iranian intermediate learners' receptive and productive performances of L2 collocations in the context of concordancing?   
(3) What are the learners' attitudes towards concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations?

# Method

# Participants

In the present study 160 Iranian intermediate university learners of English (42 male and 118 female) volunteered to participate. The participants' age ranged from 19 to 25 and they were bilingual in Azari-Turkish and Persian. They had studied English for seven years, two hours a week, in high school and for two or three years at university. However, some of them had attended some English language teaching institutes as well. Based on the results of a proficiency test 145 participants were selected. A pretest assured that all the participants had no receptive or productive mastery of the targeted collocations. With the passage of time 25 learners withdrew and the data of 120 learners (34 male, 86 female) were analyzed.

# Targeted collocations

A total of 270 (135 lexical and 135 grammatical) collocations were selected to be taught. Lexical collocations were of three main categories: verb-noun, adjective-noun, and nounverb collocations. Grammatical collocations were of four main categories: verb-preposition, preposition-noun, adjective -preposition, and noun-preposition collocations (Table 1).

The nodes of the targeted collocations were selected randomly. The collocates, however, were selected on the basis of their mutual information (MI) and the strength and magnitude of association between the node and the collocate (Church & Hank, 1990). MI ranges from 0 to 17; an MI index of 0 implies that the two words co-occur randomly while an MI index of 17 represents a strong relationship between the node and the collocate (e.g., Siyanova & Schmitt, 2008). The collocates which had the highest MI compared to the other collocates of the node were selected. For example, of the collocates for the node appetite,big (6.05), large (5.64), enormous (8.67), and huge (8.07), the collocate enormous was given priority over the other collocates because of its high MI. For measuring MI, Brigham Young-British National Corpus (BY-BNC) - available at /corpus.byu.edu/ bnc/ -- was consulted.

# Concordancer

For the present study, Concordance 3.3 (2009), a powerful and user-friendly software package available at www.concordancesoftware.co.uk, was installed on 25 computers. Counting words, making wordlists and word frequencies, and making fast concordancing are among the main features of the software. The nodes of 270 collocations targeted in the present study along with 15 examples for each of these collocations were incorporated into the concordancer. The examples were extracted from BY-BNC.

To help learners find the collocations easily, the collocations of each session were sorted into a separate file. As a result, 10 files were designed for 10 sessions. In every session, only 27 collocations included in a single file were available in the concordancer.

On the opening page of the concordancer, learners found the list of the nodes on the left side of the screen. By clicking on each node, they gained access to its concordance lines on the right side under headword. Figure 1 represents a screenshot of the list of the nodes and concordance lines in the concordancer.

By clicking on each concordance line, in turn, the learners got access to the expanded context (Figure 2). Learners were advised to maximize the window to read each collocation in the context provided.

# Tasks

Ten story-writing and 10 paraphrasing tasks were designed to be presented to the participants for 10 sessions. The story-writing task included a list of 12 related words about a certain topic. Learners were supposed to write a story about the given topic embedding all those words along with their collocates. A piece of information including the Persian equivalent of the collocation was given in square brackets to direct learners towards using the collocations (e.g., fever [n]: [adj $\mathrm { ~ n ~ } \mathbb { Y } \mathbb { 1 } \breve { \cdot } \breve { \mathbb { d } } \breve { \mathbb { J } }$ . Learners were required to use high fever in their stories. There was no time and word limit for completing the task.

In the paraphrasing task, the participants were exposed to an authentic text in which 15 lexical and grammatical collocations were embedded. The node of the collocation was underlined and the information related to the collocate was given in Persian in square brackets (e.g., Some complications [adj-n; $( 5 1 ) ( 5 ) ^ { 3 } \div ( 1 0 ) ^ { 1 } 9 0 ]$ are blindness ...). Learners were required to paraphrase this sentence embedding the given adjective. Flesch-Kincaid English, available at www.standards-schmandards.com, was used to measure the text-diffculty of this task. The mean of the ease scores of the paraphrasing tasks was 48.9 (an index judged to be appropriate for intermediate learners).

# The evaluation questionnaire

A 22-item Likert-scale questionnaire was designed along with two open-ended questions to elicit the participants' opinion on the concordancer in general and scaffolding in particular. The questionnaire included three sections: English collocations, story-writing and paraphrasing tasks, and concordancing. The English collocation section comprised seven items which asked about the learners' attitude towards the importance of collocations in L2 and their prior experience with collocations, if any. The story-writing and paraphrasing section which comprised five items dealt with learners' opinion on the given tasks. The concordancing section contained 10 items which asked about the learners' attitudes towards the influence of concordancing and scaffolding on improving their mastery over collocations. The two open-ended questions were concerned with the advantages and disadvantages of concordancing.

# Interview

Upon completing the questionnaire, each individual was interviewed in Persian in about five minutes on the effectiveness of concordancing and scaffolding. They were asked about the extent to which they believed concordancing could serve as an effective tool for learning collocations. Also, their opinion was elicited on the effectiveness of scaffolding in using concordancing.

# Procedure

To investigate the influence of concordancing and scaffolding on the recognition and production of L2 collocations, a 15-session study was conducted. To begin with, the pretest and the treatment tasks were piloted on 43 learners. The analysis of the data revealed that, as expected, intermediate learners had almost no knowledge of the targeted collocations. The design of the study is summarized in Table 2.

In the first session of the study all participants were given a proficiency test, i.e., the Cambridge Preliminary English test (PET). The next session learners were given the pretest (a receptive test and two productive tasks) to make sure that they did not have any knowledge of the targeted collocations prior to the treatments. The receptive measure included a 20-item structure and written expression test, and the productive measure included story-writing and paraphrasing tasks. On the basis of the results gained from the proficiency test and pretest, learners were divided into four homogeneous groups: symmetrical scaffolding $^ +$ the concordancer group $( n = 3 0 )$ , asymmetrical scaffolding $^ +$ the concordancer group $( n = 3 0$ no-scaffolding $^ +$ the concordancer group $( n = 3 0 )$ ), and the control group $( n = 3 0 )$

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) run on the data obtained from the proficiency test revealed that there was no statistically significant difference among the groups, $F = . 3 2 , p = . 8 0$ Two more one-way ANOVAs showed that there was no significant difference among the groups either in the receptive or in the productive pretest,

Note: $\mathrm { C } =$ concordancer.

$F = 2 . 5 4 , p = . 6 0 ; F = 1 . 1 0 , p = . 3 5 ,$ respectively. The receptive and productive pretests were then excluded from further analysis.

In the third session all the experimental groups were briefed in Persian about collocations, the concordancer, and the way they could benefit from the concordancer. From session 3 to 12 the individuals in the experimental groups were first given one answer sheet to complete one story-writing and one paraphrasing task without having access to the concordancer to make them notice the gap (Swain, 1985) and to whet their appetite for learning collocations. After delivering the answer sheet, learners got access to the concordancer to search for the collocations of each task, read at least 10 concordance lines for each collocation, and then choose one example to be written in the second answer sheet under three different conditions.

The symmetrical scaffolding $^ +$ the concordancer group was further divided into 10 homogeneous subgroups of three to receive symmetrical scaffolding. When all the three members of the group completed the tasks individually, they were given the second answer sheet to write the examples from the concordancer collaboratively. One of the members of each group was in charge of running the computer in each session. Completing the second answer sheet, learners were required to review them collaboratively. The same procedure was adopted for 10 sessions. To have participants get acquainted with the concordancer, they were asked to write the examples provided by the concordancer for two sessions. From session 3, they were instructed to write their own examples collaboratively, after searching for the word in the concordancer.

The asymmetrical scaffolding $^ +$ the concordancer group was given the same treatment for 10 sessions. They had access to both the concordancer and asymmetrical scaffolding. Completing the tasks individually, each learner was then assisted by the third author in searching for the collocations in the concordancer and choosing one example to be written in the answer sheet after clicking on 10 concordance lines. Learners received the highest amount of scaffolding in the first session and the least amount of scaffolding in the last session when they were expected to become self-regulated. They reviewed their answer sheet with the third author.

The no-scaffolding $^ +$ the concordancer group followed the same procedure minus scaffolding. The third author ran conversation classes for the control group for 10 sessions. Along with conversations there was also some focus on vocabulary items and idioms but not on collocations. At the end of each session learners in the control group were required to do the treatment tasks on their own without having access to either scaffolding or the concordancer.

In session 13, all the experimental groups reviewed their portfolios which included the answer sheets they had completed while having access to the concordancer over 10 sessions. They were then given the evaluation questionnaire and were interviewed. In session 14, all participants took the immediate posttest (receptive and productive tasks parallel to the pretest) individually. The reliability of the immediate receptive posttest was calculated. The Cronbach alpha computed for it was .715. One month later, they took the delayed posttest (receptive and productive tasks parallel to the immediate posttest) in session 15. To check the extent to which the immediate and delayed posttests were parallel in terms of their level of difficulty, a Pearson correlation was conducted which yielded an index of .777. In the immediate and delayed posttests, productive tests were given to learners prior to the receptive one to minimize test effect.

# Results

The descriptive statistics for the receptive performance of the four groups indicated that the means of all the concordancing groups (i.e., the symmetrical, asymmetrical, and noscaffolding groups) were better than the mean of the no-concordancing group (i.e., the control group) both in the immediate and delayed posttests (Table 3).

Results of a complex mixed design (time as the within-subjects variable and concordancing and scaffolding as the between-subjects variables) for the receptive performance of learners indicated that the interaction effect for time and concordancing yielded by the Wilks' lambda was not statistically significant, $F = . 2 5$ $p = . 6 1$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 \bar { 0 } 2$ . Results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference among the performances of the groups over time (i.e., immediate posttest and delayed posttest) either. The interaction for time and scaffolding also did not reach statistical significance, $F = 1 . 8 4$ $p = . 1 6$ $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ .031. The main effect for time represented no statistically significant difference, $F = . 1 7$ $p = . 6 7$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 2$

The main effect for concordancing was statistically significant with a moderate effect size, $F = 7 . 5 8 $ $p = . 0 0 7$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 6 \bar { 1 }$ ; the concordancing groups outperformed the noconcordancing group. The main effect for scaffolding, however, did not reach statistical significance, $F = 1 . 5 8 , p = . 2 1 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 7$ ; the scaffolding groups (i.e., the symmetrical and asymmetrical groups) performed the same as the no-scaffolding groups (i.e., the noscaffolding and control groups).

The descriptive statistics for the productive task (Table 4) displayed that the concordancing groups performed better than the no-concordancing group both in the immediate and delayed posttests.

Results of another complex mixed design for the productive task showed no interaction effect for time and concordancing, $F = . 6 6 5$ $p = . 4 1$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 6$ . The interaction effect for time and scaffolding was not statistically significant either, $F = . 3 7 9$ $p = . 6 8$ A $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 6$ The main effect for time did not reach statistical significance, $F = . 0 5 3 , p =$ .81, $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 0$

Results revealed a statistically significant difference for concordancing, $F = 1 9 . 9$ $p < . 0 0 1$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 4 7$ The effect size given under partial eta squared value indicated a large difference between the concordancing groups and the no-concordancing group (i.e., the control group). The main effect for scaffolding, however, was not statistically significant, $F = 1 . 9 8 , p = . 1 4 2$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 3 3$

# Qualitative data analysis

The experimental groups' responses to the questionnaire revealed that $82 \%$ of learners did not pay much attention to collocations prior to this study, though $9 2 \%$ considered collocations as an essential component of language. Also $7 6 \%$ of learners judged concordancing to be the best pedagogical tool for learning collocations, and $4 7 \%$ of learners agreed that the concordancer was more effective than teacher explicit instruction in learning collocations. With respect to the effect of concordancing on learning collocations, $5 5 \%$ of respondents maintained that collocations learned in the context of concordancing are not easily forgotten. Interestingly, $78 \%$ of learners believed that the concordancer was not confusing for them. The frequency of learners' responses to the first section of the questionnaire is displayed in Table 5.

The second section of the questionnaire elicited learners' opinions on the story-writing and paraphrasing tasks. A look at the frequency of the learners' responses showed that $43 \%$ of learners found the story-writing task easier than the paraphrasing task. However, $67 \%$ of learners believed that the text of the paraphrasing task was easy enough to understand. A total of $59 \%$ of learners preferred to do the story-writing task first, and $50 \%$ of learners stated that they had read the text of paraphrasing task during task completion. The summary of the frequency of learners' responses to the second section of the questionnaire is provided in Table 6.

The last section of the questionnaire addressed learners' attitudes towards concordancing and scaffolding. Despite the fact that they had easy access to computers and the Internet, only $3 7 \%$ of learners reported that they had used CALL before participating in the present study, whereas $9 9 \%$ of learners reported that they had not been familiar with concordancing. Surprisingly enough, only $3 8 \%$ of learners considered CALL to be easier and more interesting than teacher explicit instruction. However, $80 \%$ of learners believed that the concordancer was user-friendly. Totally, $50 \%$ of learners stated that they needed the teacher's assistance in searching for the collocations in the concordancer but only $1 9 \%$ of the learners preferred their peers' assistance. Furthermore, $60 \%$ of learners believed that working with the concordancer was not boring.

Interestingly, $100 \%$ of respondents confirmed the positive influence of the study on raising their consciousness as to paying more attention to the co-occurrence of words in the input they received. Also $91 \%$ of learners stated that they would try to use the collocations they learned in their productions. A total of $78 \%$ of learners reported that they would recommend using the concordancer to other learners. Table 7 represents a summary of the frequency of the learners' responses to the third section of the questionnaire.

The open-ended questions of the questionnaire elicited participants' opinion on the advantages and disadvantages of learning collocations in the context of concordancing. Learners' responses to the advantages were sorted into eight main types: exposing learners to more examples $( 2 3 \% )$ , being effective in learning collocations $( 2 2 \% )$ , promoting consciousness-raising $( 2 0 \% )$ , being interesting and modern $( 1 9 \% )$ , being userfriendly $( 1 5 \% )$ , providing contextual support $( 8 \% )$ , promoting discovery-learning $( 7 \% )$ and increasing long-term learning $( 5 \% )$

Learners' responses to the disadvantages, however, were categorized into nine types: boring $( 1 6 \% )$ , confusing $( 1 3 \% )$ , easy to forget $( 1 0 \% )$ , lacking teacher support $( 7 \% )$ time-consuming $( 5 \% )$ , irritating eyes $( 5 \% )$ , having no pronunciation aid $( 4 \% )$ , having long examples with some unknown words $( 3 \% )$ , and having poor font type $( 2 \% )$

The first question in the interview required learners to express the degree of their satisfaction with the concordancer. Around $74 \%$ of learners approved of the concordancer as an excellent tool for learning collocations and $20 \%$ of them believed that they should review the collocations at home to avoid forgetting. The second question asked if they liked to take part in concordancing classes to learn more collocations. About $8 7 \%$ of learners showed keen interest in experiencing concordancing again, $10 \%$ of learners promised to take part if they had enough time, and only $1 \%$ of learners expressed reluctance to take part.

Learners were also asked about their preferences to use the concordancer with the help of their teacher, peers, or on their own. Of all the participating learners, $4 8 \%$ preferred to work with their teacher, $34 \%$ preferred to work with their friends ( $5 7 \%$ preferred a more knowledgeable peer and $3 6 \%$ liked a peer at their own level of proficiency), and only $1 3 \%$ preferred to work on their own.

# Discussion

Results of this study indicated that all the experimental groups outperformed the control group both in the receptive and productive tasks. Learners' good performance in the delayed posttest, without any retention loss after one month, lent support to the positive role of concordancing in learning L2 collocations. No statistically significant difference, however, was observed between the improvement of the lexical and grammatical collocations either in the receptive or productive performances. Findings are in line with those of some previous studies (e.g., Chan & Liou, 2005; Chang & Sun, 2009) which reported the positive effect of concordancing on learning L2 collocations.

Cobb (1999) argued that when learners search for the material on their own, they learn and remember it for a longer span of time. Concordancing provides learners with repeated exposure to a single collocation in different contexts. In the present study since the experimental groups were required to be intimately involved in writing the examples and reviewing them, they could improve their performance in the immediate posttest and sustain their improved performance in the delayed posttest.

Laufer and Hulstijn's (2001) ILH might also explain the improved performance of the experimental groups both in the receptive and productive tasks over time. When learners are exposed to collocations repeatedly in concordancing and the need for learning them is determined by themselves, the collocations gain higher load of involvement which in turn reinforces learning and retrieval. Put differently, concordancing provides learners with authentic and contextualized materials which have the potential to result in deeper engagement and long-lasting learning.

The analysis of the mean differences of the experimental groups both in the receptive and productive tasks demonstrated that the asymmetrical group outperformed both the symmetrical and no-scaffolding groups, and the symmetrical group, in turn, outperformed the no-scaffolding group. However, results indicated no statistically significant difference among the performances of the experimental groups either in receptive or productive tasks. Results of the present study were inconsistent with a number of studies which reported the significant impact of asymmetrical scaffolding (e.g., Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994; Chang & Sun, 2009) and symmetrical scaffolding (e.g., Fernandez et al., 2001; Guerrero & Villamil, 2000) on L2 learning. Such a contradictory result can be attributed to the nature of the present study. Unlike the previous studies (e.g., Chang & Sun, 2009; Le, 2010) in which large corpora were resorted to as the reference tool, in this study the concordancer was straightforward and user-friendly which could account for strikingly similar performance of the experimental groups.

This finding can partly be explained by the 10-session experience which the experimental groups had in using the concordancer. In studies done by Chang and Sun (2009) and Le (2010), learners were exposed to concordancing for limited sessions. It seems that all the experimental groups in the present study had enough chance to become quite familiar with concordancing and developed a sort of collocation-wiseness over 10 sessions. Of equal importance was the amount of exposure of learners to the collocations in this study. Having been exposed to 15 examples, learners were required to write their own examples for each collocation. They were also required to review the collocations of each session before leaving the class, and finally they were asked to review the whole col1ocations in session 13 which could facilitate learning the targeted collocations.

As learners reported in the evaluation questionnaire, this study raised their consciousness as to collocations in their readings. Raising learners' consciousness about collocations might have drawn their attention to this component of language and has urged them to rehearse the collocations in focus in their working memory. This much awareness regarding one specific component of language is likely to assist learning.

Last but not least, participants in the experimental groups found the concordancer as a modern and interesting way of learning collocations, as they expressed in the questionnaire. In light of the novelty effect (Clark & Sugrue, 1988) we can argue that since the concordancer and collocations were a new learning experience to the learners of the experimental groups in this study, even the group which received no scaffolding could achieve some gains as they probably paid more attention, increased their attention span, and showed more interest and persistence.

Armed with the data obtained from the questionnaire and interview, one can claim that learners paid less attention to collocations prior to taking part in this study. Thanks to the present study, they came to this realization that collocations are an essential part of L2 and should be given the same attention as devoted to other components of language. All learners were deeply satisfied with the experimental sessions and stated that the treatment raised their consciousness and as a result they came to pay more attention to the cooccurrence of words while studying. This finding lends support to the previous studies (e.g., Chan & Liou, 2005) in which learners stated that concordancing raised their consciousness as to noticing the collocations in the input. The common thread which runs through all these studies is that concordancing derives learners' awareness towards the collocations and makes them more collocation-wise. All in all, learners had a positive attitude towards scaffolding. A large percentage of participating learners believed that they needed the teacher's support in searching for the collocations in concordancing. Findings are also consistent with prior studies (e.g., Chang & Sun, 2009; O'Sullivan & Chambers, 2006) which showed learners' positive attitude towards scaffolding.

# Conclusion

The present study set out to investigate the influence of concordancing and symmetrical and asymmetrical scaffolding on learners' receptive and productive performances of both lexical and grammatical collocations, on the one hand, and learners' attitudes towards concordancing and scaffolding in learning L2 collocations, on the other. To this end, 120 intermediate Iranian learners of English participated in a 15-session study. Results indicated a statistically significant difference between the experimental groups and the control group in the context of concordancing. Scaffolding, however, did not yield a significant difference among the experimental groups. Learners expressed positive attitudes towards the concordancer and scaffolding for learning collocations. Results of both the quantitative and qualitative studies supported the prominent role of concordancing and scaffolding in promoting learning L2 collocations.

The present study is not free from limitations. The very first limitation of the study relates to using only intermediate learners and excluding other levels of proficiency. Of different types of scaffolding only symmetrical and asymmetrical have been selected to be provided for the participants. Other types of scaffolding may lead to some different results.
