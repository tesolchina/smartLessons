Meta-analyses of research show that notetaking enhances listening, active learning, and recall (e.g., Kobayashi, 2006). Unsurprisingly, taking notes leads to better performance than not taking notes (e.g., Fischer & Harris, 1973). However, the notion of what constitutes “good” notes remains unclear, particularly from the perspective of EAP teachers. Various methods for evaluating the quality of student notes have been proposed by teachers and researchers, including total notations, content words, information units, and test answerability (e.g., Crawford, 2015; Dunkel, 1988). Some teachers also give grades for student notes, and focus on aspects such as legibility and organization.

This paper considers the benefits and drawbacks of several methods for evaluating notes. It then promotes the notion of “information unit” (IU) as arguably the most relevant method for teaching EAP. The paper illustrates how notes can be evaluated through IU analysis using excerpts from a TED Talk and samples of an EAP student's notes. Other methods are also applied to the note samples in order to demonstrate that IU analysis is a more useful measure of lecture comprehension. This analysis also describes why certain entries in student notes may or may not qualify as IUs, thereby illustrating the concept in practice.

# 1. Introduction

Taking notes while listening has been a common strategy used to stimulate recall and compensate for memory challenges. The ability to listen, record information in writing, and then rely on and use that information later is a ubiquitous and essential cognitive tool for academic as well as work and personal life. From an educational perspective, notetaking engages students when listening, enhances active learning, and stimulates recall, and these benefits apply whether a listener is listening to and/ or writing notes in their first language (L1) or second language (L2). Furthermore, notetaking is often recognized as the distinguishing characteristic of learning at university (van der Meer, 2012) and thus a priority for EAP students and teachers. Its importance, particularly for L2 users, continues to grow along with the number of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) courses offered at universities worldwide and the increasing amount of L2 English users who study abroad in countries where English is the L1 (e.g., students from China studying overseas in Canada).

While the importance and frequency of notetaking is difficult to deny, determining the quality of a given set of notes is far less clear. What constitutes “good” notes? A reasonable answer could arguably be that high quality notes include a high number of complete ideas expressed by a speaker, although this can vary depending on the purpose of notetaking. Who has the authority to decide that notes are good or bad? Notes are first and foremost meaningful to the individual notetaker, and others may or may not be able to extract the same information from the notes as the original taker. If notes help stimulate the recall of certain information for the notetaker, is that criteria alone sufficient to designate the notes “good”? Or can someone other than the notetaker, such as a teacher or researcher, place labels on the quality of notes?

A common sense, everyday approach to judging notes might be that as long as the notetaker can decipher their own notes, those notes serve their purpose. This description likely applies to most situations outside of an educational context. However, within an educational context, students with “good” notes typically perform better on tests (e.g., Hayati & Jalilifar, 2009) and may be viewed positively by their teachers as compared to students who take “bad” notes (or worse, none at all). As Kobayashi (2005) points out, “many students believe in the positive effect of note-taking process itself on the learning performance” (sic) (p. 243). The general notion of “good” and “bad” notes is often a subjective judgment made by someone external to the notetaking act itself. Yet L2 teachers in some parts of the world need to assign grades to notes. Part of a teacher's job, then, may be to identify both good and bad notetaking behavior, praise the positive, and design and implement instruction to help the “bad” notetakers improve.

In order to analyze notes themselves (rather than knowledge- and/or skill-related tasks that notes may be used for, such as tests) in objective ways, several methods have been devised for quantifying the information contained in a given set of notes. The purpose of this paper is to review those methods and point out strengths and weaknesses of each. Based on this discussion, the notion of “information unit” (IU) is promoted as arguably the most appropriate indicator of notetaking quality and helps to address the question of what makes “good” notes, particularly in the field of L2 education.

To illustrate the concept of IUs, samples of student notes taken while listening to a TED Talk will be compared to a transcript of that speech (Gary Kovacs, retrieved from https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_kovacs_tracking_the_trackers). Comparison between analyses of the notes using different methods will demonstrate that the IU provides a more complete representation of comprehension. Factors involved in scoring procedures will be exemplified and explained in an attempt to provide teachers with a practical and objective method for making judgments on “good” notes and to move the growing research body on notetaking in a direction where consistency in scoring notes is possible.

# 2. Background

The skill of notetaking has received a surge of attention in the English as a foreign language (EFL)/English as a second language (ESL) field in recent years. Courses with titles such as “Academic listening” and “Lecture notetaking” have become commonplace in EFL contexts, particularly for high school and university-aged students. Intensive English Programs (IEPs) have also become important departments, preparing EFL/ESL students for and funneling them into mainstream university courses. Publishers and materials writers have rushed to create textbooks and semi-authentic lecture recordings for lecture notetaking. For EFL students, the opportunity to study overseas at university in English-speaking countries has generated the need for academic skills classes to prep students to perform on campus in several contexts. In addition, English is the medium of instruction on numerous academic programs worldwide; thus, having adequate notetaking skills and/or receiving instruction to improve, can be decisive factors when it comes to student success (e.g., Crawford, 2015; Kobayashi, 2006).

Teachers and students both recognize the importance of notetaking for academic success. Research into English notetaking practices in EFL contexts has demonstrated that students believe notetaking will benefit their futures and that they desire more explicit instruction for the skill (e.g., Crawford, Ducker, MacGregor, Kojima & Siegel, 2016; Siegel, 2016, pp. 277e284). While EFL/ESL teachers generally agree that notetaking is crucial to a student's future, they also report a lack of pedagogical competence for teaching students how to take notes (Siegel, in press). The topic of notetaking has also received media attention in L1 contexts, with a recent Wall Street Journal article emphasizing the importance of notes: “I'd be an ‘A’ student if I could just read my notes” (The Wall Street Journal, 19 March 2018). The article highlights tensions between faculty and students who use laptops and tablets in lectures as well as student struggles with taking notes by hand.

Teachers of EAP courses often have various goals of instruction for their students in terms of academic listening and notetaking. One goal of instruction related to notetaking is a strategic approach. That is, in theory, the introduction and practicing of notetaking strategies (e.g., noting keywords, using abbreviations and/or symbols) in the EAP classroom can transfer to authentic listening opportunities. Students may practice certain strategies at a micro-level with a focus on demonstrating strategy acquisition. Strategies are then applied to lecture content, for example, in an effort to use them in a more holistic listening and notetaking activity. This progression is similar to the three stages of skill acquisition: a cognitive or declarative stage; an associative or procedural stage; and an autonomous or automatic stage (e.g., DeKeyser, 2007). A second instructional goal is increasing learners’ metacognitive awareness while listening, which encourages students to plan, anticipate, monitor and reflect on their listening performance (Vandergrift & Goh, 2012). These meta-cognitive steps can also be applied to notetaking development and instruction. In other words, being aware of options for notetaking, anticipating what the speaker will say and what information will need to be noted, reviewing notes, and reflecting on note quality with a view to future improvement are all important instructional goals. In addition, teachers, especially those teaching Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) courses, may focus on transmission of information from a more knowledgeable source (e.g., a lecturer, video recording, news broadcast, etc.) to students. From a knowledge transmission perspective, IUs (discussed in more detail below) may be used to assess whether and the extent to which students have selected and recorded important pieces of information from the content to which they are listening. Depending on student listening proficiency level, purposes for notetaking, and/or course goals, any combination of these instructional goals may be desirable in an EAP course that includes notetaking.

When it comes to teaching notetaking skills, several teachers and researchers have suggested various approaches. These include well-known notetaking systems such as the Cornell method, the outline method, and creating matrices (e.g., Kiewra, Benton, Kim, Risch, & Christensen, 1995; Tsai & Wu, 2010; Song, 2011). Others (Siegel, 2016, in press) have promoted exercises that help students with the decision making processes involved in notetaking. In addition, some teachers may simply rely on an EFL/ESL notetaking textbook and go through it unit by unit. Regardless of the instructional approach taken, teachers should have methods for evaluating the quality of their students’ notes, both as a representation of listening comprehension in the moment and as an external repository of information that can be used later (e.g., the encoding and storage effects) (Piolat, Olive, & Kellogg, 2005). While teachers may use post-listening tasks on which students utilize the notes they have taken, such as multiple choice tests or summary writing, activities like these involve much more than the notes themselves (e.g., integration of multiple language and cognitive skills, transfer of information from one form to another, test anxiety, etc.). Thus, they are not indicative of the quality of notes but rather what a learner can do with the notes.

“Good” notes could be defined as notes that select, organize and elaborate ideas expressed by speakers so that the notetaker can learn in generative and constructive ways. In addition, “good” notes presumably capture and preserve information in a form that stimulates recall of main and supporting details for the individual notetaker. Therefore, an outside viewer may not be able to extract the same information as the notetaker because the outside viewer: a) was not present when the notes were encoded and/or b) was not privy to the notetaker's thought processes and reasoning when encoding the information. From this perspective, “good” notes can be taken in any format using any combination of words, abbreviations, pictures, symbols, etc.

# 3. Researcher perspectives of note quality

The increased importance of notetaking from a pedagogic perspective has also stimulated interest in both L1 and L2 notetaking practices. Researchers have been examining student notes in a number of different ways, including quality, quantity, organization, and usefulness. This increased research also acknowledges the “real-life" integrated nature of notetaking, which combines listening, decision making, writing, and later, reading and reviewing notes (e.g., Siegel, in press). Whereas in the past, much L2 research focused specifically on a given skill such as writing or vocabulary acquisition, research on notetaking marks a challenging endeavor to understand how skills are intertwined and operate in authentic situations (e.g., Siegel & Burns, 2018). Examinations of this multi-faceted skill need to acknowledge that these skills do not operate in isolation and must all cooperate to accomplish the task.

To help understand possible methods for evaluating student notes, Table 1 provides a digest of methods used in previous research. It is important to note that these scholars focused on evaluating the actual student notes in contrast to many other researchers, who have focused on the usability of those notes (e.g., using the notes to complete a test of lecture comprehension or to write a summary) (e.g., Song, 2011).

While some of these methods may be transparent based on their names, the term IU needs further clarification. An IU is similar to a “lecture point” or a “proposition”, defined by Anderson (2014) as “the smallest unit of knowledge that can stand as a separate assertion … the smallest unit one can judge as true or false” (p. 104). IUs typically contain a combination of at least two words, abbreviations, pictures, and/or symbols, which may include an agent or actor (noun), an action (a verb), and/or a description (an adjective or adverb), the combination of which creates a complete proposition that is explicit and relies more on the written notes themselves rather than on memory to stimulate recall. Rather than “lecture point”, the term “IU” is used here because it is applicable to notetaking in situations distinct from lectures, such as class discussions, business meetings, and interviews.

Teachers in many ESL and EFL contexts provide feedback on student notes, praising “good” notes and giving suggestions for improvement. Teachers may also show students their own notes and offer them as a model (Siegel, in press). They typically encourage students to use abbreviations and to employ symbols and arrows to delineate relationships between different pieces of information (e.g., Crawford, 2015). These activities seem to be a normal part of teaching and helping learners to improve their notetaking abilities. Since some teachers are required to grade student notes and assign points or percentages of a student's grade based on notetaking quality, determining standards for notetaking quality should be a prime concern for these teachers.

Teacher perspectives of note quality.

Depending on the institution, teachers may have grading policies for student notes imposed on them by administrators, or they may be left to develop their own individual method for assigning grades. Some teachers have expressed displeasure and resistance related to grading policies imposed on them. This resistance comes from, for example, the perspective that notes are meaningful first and foremost to the notetaker. Another source of tension related to grading notes may stem from a teacher's instructional goals for teaching notetaking. That is, perspectives on whether the process or the product of notetaking should be the focus of grading is open to question. In addition, since many students need to use their notes to answer comprehension questions or to write a summary, teachers may feel that grading the end task rather than the notes (which have an intermediary function) is more relevant and appropriate (i.e., if the student can perform well on the end task based on their memory capacity and “poor” notes, should they be penalized for those subjectively “poor” notes?).

Personal teacher policies for grading notes often include rather subjective elements such as organization, legibility, and effort. Such factors make grading notes an imprecise undertaking. The amount of words recorded is a more objective way to evaluate; however, as discussed in Table 2, the number of words does not necessarily ensure that actual and complete concepts and ideas have been recorded. Another factor to consider is whether the notes are recorded in the L2 or the L1 (e.g., Tsai & Wu, 2010), as well as the degree of tolerance the teacher has for notes in the L1.

# 4. Illustrating the IU

The following samples illustrate how the five selected methods (e.g., total number of notations, total number of words, content words, IUs, and abbreviations) can be applied to lecture content and student notes. Other methods described above have not been applied to these note samples because they rely on external factors (e.g., post-lecture comprehension questions). In each sample, a transcript extract, which has been coded for IUs, is shown first. The bolded numbers in parentheses indicate the IU number, and the highlighted text shows where each IU begins and ends. A sample of student notes related to that section of the lecture is then displayed, after which comes a table displaying quantitative analysis according to the selected evaluation methods. Next, discussion related to the scoring of the student notes via IUs and the other methods is presented. The note samples come from one student involved in a larger study involving upper secondary school students in [country] (Siegel, in press), who were at approximately a B1-B2 level on the Common European Framework for Reference of Language (CEFR) scale.

# Sample 1

I'm continually amazed to think that (1) two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the Internet and that (2) at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world's population can go online to learn, to create and to share. And (3) the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow. A recent study showed that the (4) young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online. As the parent of a nine-year-old girl, (5) that number seems awfully low.

![](img/b912a65defb73cac4a049355b03f7edb1164868e41f08ec61fdec0a3db3bb69d.jpg)

In the Sample 1 notes, the student has attempted to record three of the possible five IUs. In the first line, “2,5 billion conneted” represents IU 1, despite the misspelling of “connected”. The student has arguably captured the essence of the idea expressed by the speaker. The second line, $\ " 3 0 \%$ of (picture of Earth and person) (arrow to) www” registers as IU 2, this time recording the message in a combination of numbers, symbols, words, pictures and abbreviations. However, the ${ } ^ { \bullet } 8 \mathrm { h }$ a day” does not qualify as an IU because it is not immediately clear what it means. While it is possible that ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { a } } { } _ { 8 } { } \mathrm { h }$ a day” plus “www” could be interpreted as ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { a } } \mathrm { b }$ online per day”, the absence of reference to young people being online eight hours a day means that the entire idea has not been recorded, and thus, this student has missed IU 4. This student did not attempt IUs 3 and 5.

Table 3 illustrates how the same note sample can be evaluated via different methods. The table includes a total count with each individual item tallied separated by a semi-colon. In contrast to the two IUs successfully recorded, the other methods do not generate information that is meaningful in terms of complete propositions. In other words, simply recording individual words or numbers (e.g., four words in ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { a } } \mathrm { b }$ a day”) does not communicate a complete idea (i.e., that young people are online more than $^ { 8 \mathrm { h } }$ a day). The total notations, for example, is the highest number at 17, but the notetaker or an external reader would need to draw extensively on memory or inference to put those individual words and/or numbers into a meaningful context.

Much of what the speaker says in the second extract is rather obvious, setting up later points, or redundant in that he repeats similar ideas in different words. Therefore, this extract contains only two IUs, and the student gets credit for both. The student has recorded “opend us to the world”, likely referring to the internet. However, these days this is a rather obvious statement and therefore not particularly pertinent to record in notes. The student gets credit for the IU “the price we pay: our

But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us, it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world. And increasingly, (6) the price we're being asked to pay for all Of this connectedness is our privacy. Today, what many of us would love to believe is that the Internet is a private place; it's not. And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen, we are like Hansel and Gretel (7) leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods.

![](img/325755527885263b6a5bbd62d7dccfa2f6224fdf00f288e6666603109fd07786.jpg)

privacy” and “leaving [privacy] everywhere”. Even without writing all of the words the speaker says related to these two separate ideas, the student is able to record the essence of the message. These latter two lines in the notes illustrate the notion that one does not have to record all of the words a speaker presents in order to capture the intended meaning. The use of the arrow to repeat and reposition “privacy” is also an efficient and effective strategy. Table 4 displays analysis generated from Sample 2.

In Sample 2, the student has recorded important words such as “opened” and “world”. However, on their own, neither captures the idea the speaker is expressing. Thus, they need to be recorded in tandem in order for the proposition to be crystalized in notes without relying on memory to fill in any blanks. Likewise, the words “leaving”, “privacy”, and “everywhere” mean very little individually, but when combined, they express the concept the speaker is relating. Individual word counts could be relatively high in terms of total words or content words, but if those words are not combined with other information (e.g., words, abbreviations, symbols), then the propositions fail to be recorded.

# Sample 3

The student gets credit for one of the possible three IUs in extract 3. The first line of the notes, “want to know– $>$ recomendation” includes general ideas similar to those expressed by the speaker. However, “want to know” could apply to several different notions related to the content of the speech. As such, it is difficult to extract meaning from this phrase, and it does not seem specific enough to help stimulate recall. Who wants to know? What is it that they want to know? Answers can vary, even when these questions are applied to the topic of the lecture. The second line, “when we don't want $=$ problem” captures the meaning of the following IU: “when I don't know and when I haven't been asked, that's when the problem arises”. The relation between the cause (not knowing) and the result (a problem) are clearly indicated in the notes. Table 5 allows for comparisons using different methods.

In the first line of the Sample 4 notes, the student attempts to record IU 14. The “entier industri” likely means “entire industry”. However, no other relevant information is noted, so one does not know what the industry has done or what makes it relevant to the current speech; thus, IU 14 has been missed. In the second line of the notes, the student successfully records both IUs 18 and 19. For IU 18, the product name “colution” has been recorded (albeit spelled incorrectly, but the essence is clear) and the arrow to the information “only in Firefox” notes this key information and from this information, one can infer that Collusion is an internet-based product. These two pieces of information are dependent on each other to capture the meaning of IU 18. If only either one of them had been recorded, no point for IU 18 would be awarded. IU 19 explains the purpose of Collusion, which has been correctly noted as “help see who's tracking you".

As seen in Table 6, the student made 21 total notations in Sample 4. While that is the highest number of total notations among the four samples, only two IUs were recorded, a finding that suggests merely writing individual words does not necessarily ensure that propositions are recorded.

# 4.1. Final thoughts

The purpose of this paper has been to argue for and attempt to demonstrate how the IU is preferable to different methods for judging the quality of notes. The L2 field would benefit from a way to consistently provide feedback on and judge the quality of notes, keeping in mind that instructional goals and purposes for notetaking may vary. After weighing the pros and cons of and applying several methods to samples of student notes, this paper promotes the IU as an important first step in

measuring note quality, which can then lead to measurements such as completeness and efficiency ratios. It is a method that focuses on complete propositions within notes and allows for individual preferences of recording while not prescribing any particular notetaking style. The IU system also allows for information in two sets of notes to be compared and evaluated in an objective way to determine whether one set is “better” than the other, although this will always depend on the person using the notes and the purpose for those notes. While there may be some debate about what constitutes an IU, inviting other teachers and/or raters to count IUs can improve inter-rater reliability of scoring notes. As the integrated, crucial skill of notetaking in academic contexts becomes more and more relevant for the high school and university learners of today, finding methods for evaluating notes that are as objective and unbiased as possible should be a priority for EAP instructors.
