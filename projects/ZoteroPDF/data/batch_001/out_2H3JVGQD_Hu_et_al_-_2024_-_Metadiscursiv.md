The study of rhetorical devices and how corporate leaders organise the texts and convey attitudes to stakeholders in corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports has become an important research area in recent years. A relatively neglected means of rhetorical expressions, however, is metadiscursive nouns. This study investigates the use of metadiscursive nouns in a 0.5-million-word self-built corpus of the US and Chinese CEO letters in CSR reports to reveal cross-cultural variations. The results show that the interactive metadiscursive nouns are twice as frequent in the US discourse as in the Chinese discourse, demonstrating greater efforts invested in cohesion by the US companies. This difference can be attributed to the writer-responsible rhetoric in the West and the reader-responsible conventions in China. The interactional metadiscursive nouns in the US discourse occur twice as frequently as in the Chinese counterpart, suggesting greater exertion of nominal stance by the US companies. This discrepancy mainly arises from the high- and lowcontext variations between the US and China. This study sheds new insights on metadiscursive nouns as rhetorical resources in cross-cultural CSR communication and provides implications for ESP practitioners to use them as a means of conceptualising writer–reader interaction in corporate communication.

# 1. Introduction

Communicating corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance to intended stakeholders is of strategic importance for companies, especially in an era where people are more conscious of the social and environmental impacts of companies. CSR refers to “the commitment of business to contribute to sustainable economic development, by working with employees, their families, the local community and society at large to improve their quality of life” (WBCSD, 2001, p. 6). CSR is a key component of corporate ethical behaviours, contributing to corporate governance (Cavusgil et al., 2020). Its significance in corporate impression management (Hooghiemstra, 2000) has stimulated the increasingly voluntary disclosure of CSR reports (e.g., Bondi & Yu, 2018; Breeze, 2013; Liu & Liu, 2023), in which companies endeavour to build favourable identities, achieve positive images among stakeholders, and thus secure competitive advantages in the capital market (Vella & Melewar, 2008). In the early 1990s, only $12 \%$ of the world’s large companies published CSR reports (KPMG, 2005). The figure, however, has surged significantly in recent years with $8 0 \%$ of the world’s large companies now issuing independent CSR reports (KPMG, 2020). This trend indicates that CSR disclosure has gradually become an indispensable corporate practice especially for companies expanding into the global market.

CSR reports are annual disclosures of CSR performance demonstrating economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic concerns (Carroll, 2016) to meet expectations of a wide range of stakeholders such as customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities (Cavusgil et al., 2020). CSR reports cluster around themes of “care for the environment, social and community issues, efficiency and sustainability” (Breeze, 2013, p. 166). This genre helps companies foster trustworthy relationship with stakeholders (Bondi, 2016; Fuoli, 2018), thereby promoting favourable corporate image and corporate reputation (Gupta, 2016), and enhancing social legitimacy (Lin, 2021). CSR reports have been investigated from various perspectives, ranging from move analysis (e.g., Bhatia, 2012; Catenaccio, 2010; Yu & Bondi, 2017), to the use of evaluative language (e.g., Aiezza, 2015; Barkemeyer et al., 2014; Bondi & Yu, 2018; Ching, 2019; Fuoli, 2012, 2018; Hu et al., 2024; Liu & Liu, 2023; Skulstad, 2005; Sun et al., 2018).

Although CSR discourse has gained increasing scholarly attention, most literature regards the whole CSR reports as research data (e.g., Aiezza, 2015; Bondi, 2016; Fuoli, 2012; Sun et al., 2018), neglecting the significance of the sub-genre CEO letters. CEO letters or CEO statements help improve the social legitimacy of corporations in a promotional way (Rajandran & Taib, 2014). Previous studies that do focus on CEO letters in CSR reports (Catenaccio, 2010; Ching, 2019; Grantham & Vieira, 2018; Liu & Liu, 2023; Rajandran & Taib, 2014), however, fail to investigate metadiscursive noun – an important rhetorical resource conceptualising writer–reader interaction.

Therefore, this study aims to fill the research gaps by exploring how the US and Chinese enterprises use metadiscursive nouns to communicate with stakeholders in the CEO letters of CSR reports. We choose CEO letters produced by enterprises from the US and China, mainly because they are the two largest economies and are home to $5 3 . 8 \%$ of the largest corporations worldwide on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2022. By adopting a cross-cultural perspective, this study might be able to promote a greater understanding and awareness of the rhetorical value systems (Matalene, 1985, p. 789), and cast new lights on “how to construct more effective messages to target the intended audience” across different cultures (Ngai & Singh, 2017, p. 3).

# 2. CEO letters in CSR reports

Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) place strong value on creating trustworthy corporate identities, devoted to achieving a unified corporate culture and strategic objectives. They convey a tone at the top that will set a powerful example for important stakeholders (Amernic et al., 2010). As the microcosm of CSR reports (Rajandran & Taib, 2014), the CEO letter is usually found in the initial section of CSR reports, with an aim to “inform, persuade, and bond” stakeholders (Gilliam & Flaherty, 2015). CEO letters play important roles in constructing positive corporate identities, which in turn affects “the development of positive stakeholder perceptions about the organization, improves its performance, and so increases its ability to acquire additional resources and succeed” (van Riel & Fombrun, 2007, p. 10).

It is a conventional practice in a standalone CSR report to offer a CEO letter as in an annual report. Although the present study mainly focuses on CEO letters in CSR reports, the literature on annual reports’ CEO letters is highly relevant as the annual report can be considered the ‘antecedent genre’ of the CSR report (Catenaccio, 2010; Ching, 2019). It is noteworthy that few studies investigate CEO letters in CSR reports (e.g., Ching, 2019; Liu & Liu, 2023). In sharp contrast, there are a greater number of studies investigating CEO letters in annual reports (e.g., Aerts & Yan, 2017; Amernic et al., 2010; Huang & Rose, 2018; Hyland, 1998; Lee, 2020, 2021, 2023), indicating that this sub-genre is a worthwhile area of investigation.

CEO letters in CSR reports might be confused with those in annual reports. It is worth mentioning that the two sub-genres are different in content and readership. First, CEO letters in annual reports focus on financial performance, whereas those in CSR reports concern sustainable performance. Second, CEO letters in annual reports devote to the communication between corporate leaders and shareholders, targeting “a specialized readership of ‘experts’” (Fuoli, 2018, p. 851). In contrast, CEO letters in CSR reports address a more diverse range of stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, suppliers), demonstrating “how a business communicates on a personal level to the broader stakeholder group” (Khan & Sulaiman, 2021, p. 515).

Despite these differences, CEO letters in the two genres share some commonalities. First, CEO letters in annual and CSR reports are usually situated at the opening of the two types of reports, which provide an introductory section for the whole corporate report (Ching, 2019). The unaudited nature of CEO letters provides highly creative freedom for corporate leaders to communicate with intended readership (e.g., Ching, 2019; Hyland, 1998). Second, move structures ‘Reporting on Company’s performance, trends and results in the relevant year’, ‘Providing a narrative of salient facts (events, operations, figures)’, ‘Illustrating outlook and priorities for the future’ are shared by CEO letters in both CSR and annual reports (Catenaccio, 2010, p. 197). Third, CEO letters in the two genres are “interdiscursive” in nature (Bhatia, 2017), showing the tension of conveying information and imparting promotion (Fuoli, 2018). Generally speaking, CEO letters are primarily promotional and convey a more positive tone compared to the other sections of CSR or annual reports (e.g., Ching, 2019; Hyland, 1998). The more promotional communicating purpose epitomises the “promotional turn” of corporate discourse (Breeze, 2013).

The similarities discussed above allow us to compare our research findings in CEO letters of CSR reports with other forms of corporate communication especially CEO letters of annual reports, which might offer additional insights into the strategic use of language in business communication by corporate leaders.

# 3. Metadiscursive nouns as rhetorical resources

The term ‘metadiscursive noun’ was coined by Tahara (2014) and has been developed by Jiang and Hyland (2017). These nouns are a sub-set of abstract nouns conveying both a constant and variable pragmatic meaning depending on contextual lexicalisation (Jiang & Hyland, 2018). They are “self-reflective expressions in texts that are intended to help organise, interpret and evaluate the ideational information delivered” (Jiang, 2022, p. 33). The investigation of metadiscursive nouns is based on the studies of abstract nouns under different terminologies. Earlier studies on ‘general nouns’ (Halliday & Hasan, 1976) and ‘type 3 vocabulary’ (Winter, 1977) have laid foundations for later research under other terms, including ‘status nouns’ (Hunston, 1989), ‘carrier nouns’ (Ivani-c, 1991), ‘labelling nouns’ (Francis, 1994), ‘shell nouns’ (Schmid, 2000), ‘general nouns’ (Mahlberg, 2005), and ‘signalling nouns’ (Flowerdew & Forest, 2015).

From the standpoint of grammatical metaphor, abstract nouns under different terms are non-congruent means of creating objects out of processes, qualities, and logical relations (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Wang & Hu, 2023). For example, the mental verb believe signals mental process and has been reconstrued into the metadiscursive noun belief (example 1) as nominalisation in CSR reports. This example reveals that nominalisation, as a powerful tool of grammatical metaphor (Halliday, 2004), can shed new insight on the rhetoric of CSR disclosure through reconstruing experiences in the process of corporate activities.

(1) In adherence to the  that “strong personnel and superior DNA thrive the enterprise”, China Unicom is committed to the proper building of beliefcorporate culture and strengthening of talent development . (CN_China Unicom 2018)

The term ‘metadiscursive noun’ is adopted in our study for two considerations. First, metadiscursive nouns focus on the rhetorical functions of abstract nouns, and are more concerned with the interactive and interactional dimensions (Jiang, 2022; Jiang & Hyland, 2017). In the interactive dimension, metadiscursive nouns signal the anaphoric or cataphoric relationship between parts of the discourse so that readers could unveil the writers’ intention (e.g., Jiang & Hyland, 2017, 2018, 2021). The anaphoric linking could be interpreted as the “encapsulation” of previous discourse, whereas cataphoric linking serves as the “prospection” of the following discourse (Sinclair, 2004). For instance, the first goal in example (2) refers to a cataphoric marker assisting readers in revealing the specific goal of Lenovo, yet the second goal anaphorically guides stakeholders to the last clause (signalled by the determiner ‘this’). In the interactional dimension, metadiscursive nouns allow writers to comment on the discourse, express their stance, and engage with readers (Jiang & Hyland, 2017). The noun goal in example (2) also serves as a stance marker, constructing Chinese companies as dedicated goal-achievers.

(2) Our  is to be recognized as a great company for both what we do and how we do it. We will accomplish this  and we will do it the Lenovo Way. goal(CN_Lenovo Group Limited 2011)

This example indicates that the contextual meaning of metadiscursive nouns may not be separated from specific grammatical structures, as grammar contributes to the co-interpretation between metadiscursive nouns and what they refer to (Jiang, 2022). The two goals in example (2) are respectively located in the patterns of $N + b e +$ complementing clause and Determiner $+ N .$ The other common grammatical patterns are $N +$ post-nominal clause and Determiner $+ \ b e \mathrm { ~ + ~ } N$ (e.g., Flowerdew & Forest, 2015; Schmid, 2000). Metadiscursive nouns controlled by the post-nominal clauses generally refer to cataphoric information; whereas nouns controlled by the latter one work as anaphoric markers, transferring the “extended reference” (Halliday & Hasan, 1976) through the linking verb be to the metadiscursive noun. Apart from the four structures, Jiang (2022) adds the pattern There $b e + N$ to the grammatical realisation of metadiscursive nouns. As shown in example (3), the noun opportunities is deployed as a cataphoric marker to guide stakeholders and discover the chances throughout product life cycle. In line with previous research, this study incorporates the five patterns above in exploring the use of metadiscursive nouns in the CEO letters.

(3) There are many  throughout the product life cycle - from the sourcing of the raw materials . to its transportation, and to how customers use it, dispose of it and recycle it. (US_Walmart 2010)

Second, the classification of metadiscursive nouns into ENTITIES, ATTRIBUTES, and RELATIONS (Table 1), proposed by Jiang and Hyland (2018), provides a solid framework for investigating the rhetorical roles played by abstract nouns in CSR reporting. For instance, the noun opportunities in example (3) can be interpreted as a STATUS noun describing dynamic modality.

As important nominal resources of the metadiscourse repertoire, metadiscursive nouns have received increasing attention in academic discourse (e.g., Is¸ ık-Tas¸ , 2018; Jiang, 2022; Jiang & Hyland, 2017, 2018, 2021; Liu & Chen, 2022; Wang & Hu, 2023). In contrast to the greater density of research in academic discourse, metadiscursive nouns in CSR discourse have received less research attention. Although a few studies do involve some metadiscursive nouns (e.g., Ching, 2019; Fuoli, 2018; Liu & Liu, 2023; Skulstad, 2005), they do not systematically explore these resources in CSR reports, not to mention in CEO letters.

Considering the importance of CEO letters in CSR reports and the scarcity of research into metadiscursive nouns from the cross-cultural perspective, this study extends the above line of research by investigating the use of metadiscursive nouns in

Note. Adapted from Jiang and Hyland (2018, p. 516).

CEO letters from various sectors between the US and Chinese enterprises. More specifically, it aims to address the following research questions:

i. What are the major differences between the US and Chinese CEO letters in using interactive metadiscursive nouns to guide readers?   
ii. What are the major differences between the US and Chinese CEO letters in using interactional metadiscursive nouns to express stance and involve readers?

# 4. Data and method

# 4.1. Corpora

In order to address the research questions, we collected CEO letters of CSR reports (published over the period 2008–2020) from the official website of the US and Chinese companies on the 2020 Fortune Global 500 list. It is noteworthy that the source language of CSR reports written by Chinese companies is mainly Chinese. As more Chinese companies “view the English translation as a competitive advantage to establish a global image and attract foreign investors” (Huang & Rose, 2018, p. 170), these companies disclose English CSR reports. Additionally, in view of feasible comparison, researchers mainly use the English version of corporate discourse when conducting discourse analysis between the US and China (e.g., Huang & Rose, 2018; Lee, 2020, 2021), which is also adopted in the present study.

Given that most studies on CSR reports focus on specific sectors (e.g., Aiezza, 2015; Fuoli, 2012), potentially constraining the generalisability of their findings to other sectors, this study collected CEO letters from a wide range of sectors (see Table 2). We then conducted data cleaning under corpus construction principles. Finally, a 0.5-million-word corpus of 630 CEO letters was constructed. The list of the companies, along with sectors and ranking information is presented in Supplementary Material. The corpus information is shown in Table 2.

# 4.2. Procedure

The analysis consists of three stages: identifying metadiscursive nouns in both corpora, analysing metadiscursive nouns by different categories, and comparing the use of metadiscursive nouns between the US and Chinese companies.

Table 2 Corpus information.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Corpus</td><td>US CEO letters</td><td>CN (Chinese) CEO letters</td></tr><tr><td>Total corpus size</td><td>246,729</td><td>253,560</td></tr><tr><td>Mean corpus size</td><td>660</td><td>990</td></tr><tr><td>Number of CEO letters</td><td>374</td><td>256</td></tr><tr><td>Number of enterprises</td><td>46</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Distribution of sectors.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Energy</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Finance</td><td>6</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td> Information technology</td><td>8</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Other sectors</td><td>25</td><td>11</td></tr></table></body></html>

Note. The ‘other sectors’ include sparse sectors with fewer than five companies. CEO letters from the engineering and construction, and motor vehicles are included in the Chinese letters, and sectors such as aerospace and defence, and general merchandise are involved in the US letters.

In Stage 1, the first step was to search potential metadiscursive nouns in part-of-speech tagged corpus through regular expression query. The part-of-speech tagging was conducted using Treetagger which reached $9 6 . 5 3 \%$ accuracy on corpus tagging (Schmid, 1999). The five common grammatical structures (i.e., $N + b e \mathrm { ~ + ~ }$ complementing clause, Determiner $+ \ N$ , $N +$ post-nominal clause, Determiner ${ \bf \dot { \theta } } + b e + N _ { \bf \theta }$ , There $b e + N )$ have been written in regular expressions and inputted in AntConc (Anthony, 2020) to extract potential metadiscursive nouns. The process of extracting grammatical structures has also been presented in Supplementary Material.

The second step was to code metadiscursive nouns under the guidance of operationalising principle. Similar to abstract nouns under other terms, a potential metadiscursive noun shall have pragmatic meanings that need to be specified through contexts, and shall form semantic equivalents with lexical specifics provided elsewhere in the text (e.g., Flowerdew & Forest, 2015; Jiang, 2022; Schmid, 2000). Considering that the five grammatical patterns are representative in identifying metadiscursive nouns, this study would not investigate nouns failing to form semantic equivalence with contents controlled by the five patterns. For instance, way in example (4) can be counted as a metadiscursive noun (‘New Finance’ as the semantic equivalence), but the to-infinitive clause we investigate fails to form a semantic equivalence with the head noun way, which would not be included in our analysis. In addition to the checklists provided by previous studies on metadiscursive nouns, we generated a list of metadiscursive nouns in the CEO letters of CSR reports (see Supplementary Material). It was found that 47 and 65 metadiscursive nouns in the US and the Chinese letters respectively did not appear in Jiang’s (2022) checklist grounded on the genre of research articles. Lastly, the raw frequencies of metadiscursive nouns in the US and Chinese CEO letters were normalized (raw frequency/corpus size $\times$ 100,000) to allow for a comparison.

(4) Therefore, New Finance is one of our  to enhance social governance and realize healthy economic operations. (CN_CCB 2019)

In Stage 2, we firstly grouped the identified metadiscursive nouns according to their semantic categories (Table 1). Then, statistical measures were conducted to identify frequency and effect size differences between the two corpora. Log-likelihood (LL hereafter) was preferred in this study to determine statistical significance, since it “makes no assumption of a normal distribution, with Chi-square becoming unreliable when the number of examples is very small” (McEnery & Hardie, 2012, p. 52). More specifically, Chi-square test is only appropriate when the expected frequencies are greater than 5. When this assumption is violated, the LL test is more appropriate for the estimation of statistical significance (Brezina, 2018, p. 113). At the 0.05 level, with 1 degree of freedom, the absolute value of LL scores that is equal to or greater than 3.84 ( $p$ -values equal to or lower than 0.05) indicates statistical significance (McEnery et al., 2006). It is essential to recognise that $p$ -value only informs the presence or absence of a significant difference, but fails to show how big a given difference is.

Log ratio, an “effect-size” measure highlighting the practical importance of observed effects and representing the size of the difference, was used to complement LL. Log ratio can be calculated by “binary log of the ratio of relative frequencies” (Hardie, 2014). For example, a word has the same relative frequency in A and B – the binary log of the ratio is 0; a word is 2 times more common in A than in B – the binary log of the ratio is 1 (ibid.). Both measures can be calculated through an online LL and effect size calculator designed by Rayson (2016).

In Stage 3, this study compared the use of metadiscursive nouns in the US and the Chinese discourse in the interactive and interactional dimensions. The possible underlying reasons for cross-cultural variations would be elaborated in Discussion.

# 5. Results and analysis

Table 3 displays the overall frequency of metadiscursive nouns in the US and Chinese letters, grouped by the five lexicogrammatical patterns. The results show that both the US and Chinese letters share a similar distribution of grammatical structures, from the most common construction $N +$ post-nominal clause to the least used one Determiner $+ \ b e \mathrm { \pm } \ N .$ .

The largest difference between the two corpora is that substantially more metadiscursive nouns are used in the US discourse than in the Chinese counterpart $\mathrm { \Delta T L } = 2 2 0 . 2 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 9 3$ ). This general difference is mainly reflected in the frequencies of $N + p o s t$ -nominal clause and Determiner $+ N$ structures, which accounts for more than $9 1 . 5 2 \%$ o f metadiscursive nouns in both corpora. The heavy use of these two structures is also revealed in the previous studies on abstract nouns (e.g., Flowerdew & Forest, 2015; Jiang, 2022; Jiang & Hyland, 2017).

With an aim to gain a deeper understanding of how metadiscursive nouns are used in the two corpora, we need to take a closer look at each dimension. The next two sections provide a more detailed account of the interactive and interactional use of metadiscursive nouns.

# 5.1. Interactive dimension of metadiscursive nouns

The interactive dimension concerns how metadiscursive nouns serve as anaphoric and cataphoric linkings, therefore creating cohesive information flow in CEO letters. Anaphoric expressions allow CEOs/chairpersons to connect with the information mentioned retrospectively (e.g., this process), whereas cataphoric ones predict the following message by assuming stakeholders’ expectations (e.g., the following case).

Table 4 shows that the interactive metadiscursive nouns are twice as frequent in the US discourse as in the Chinese discourse, revealing significant difference $\mathrm { \Delta T L } = 2 2 0 . 2 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 9 3$ ). Substantial difference is reflected in the anaphoric expressions $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 0 5 . 3 9 $ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 1 . 1 0 $ ). Similarly, the cataphoric expressions are more employed in the US letters than in the Chinese letters, showing a less significant difference $\mathrm { L L } = 1 1 8 . 6 4$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 8 4$ ). The US texts use significantly more anaphoric and cataphoric references than the Chinese ones, showing greater efforts invested in explicit cohesion in the US discourse.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Lexico-grammatical patterns</td><td>US letters</td><td>Chinese letters</td><td>LL value</td><td> p-value</td><td>Log ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Anaphoric</td><td>210.36</td><td>97.81</td><td>105.39</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>1.10</td></tr><tr><td>Determiner + N</td><td>208.33</td><td>97.02</td><td>104.03</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>1.10</td></tr><tr><td>Determiner + be + N</td><td>2.03</td><td>0.79</td><td>1.41</td><td>&gt;0.05</td><td>1.36</td></tr><tr><td>Cataphoric</td><td>374.10</td><td>209.02</td><td>118.64</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>0.84</td></tr><tr><td>N + post-nominal clause</td><td>338.83</td><td>177.47</td><td>128.45</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>0.93</td></tr><tr><td>N + be + complement clause</td><td>30.40</td><td>23.27</td><td>2.38</td><td>&gt;0.05</td><td>0.39</td></tr><tr><td>There be + N</td><td>3.65</td><td>1.97</td><td>1.27</td><td>&gt;0.05</td><td>0.89</td></tr><tr><td>Determiner + N</td><td>1.22</td><td>6.31</td><td>9.41</td><td>&lt;0.01</td><td>2.38</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>584.45</td><td>306.83</td><td>220.22</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>0.93</td></tr></table></body></html>

Anaphoric expressions are mainly realised by metadiscursive nouns in the grammatical structure Determiner $+ N .$ A closer examination of this structure shows that $T h i s + N$ is the most frequent sequence. This sequence is used more significantly common in the US corpus than in the Chinese one $\operatorname { L L } = 9 . 9 6$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 5 2$ ).

It is noteworthy that the Chinese letters use the sequence of this process more than the US counterparts (see Figure 1). Process is an EVENT noun (Jiang, 2022) characterising a series of actions with a particular result. Indicating the completion of mergers and acquisitions of China Minmetals Corporation, this process (example 5) creates a cohesive link between the former clause (mergers and acquisitions) and the ongoing discourse (the pivotal role of CSR), highlighting the value of this report.

Figure 1. Distribution of the typical metadiscursive nouns in $T h i s + N$ pattern.

The corpus findings indicate that $N +$ post-nominal clause is the most common cataphoric construction in both corpora (averaging $8 7 . 7 4 \%$ ). Post-nominal clauses include patterns of N that clause, N to-infinitive clause, N of-prepositional clause, and $N$ preposition-plus-wh clause.

(7) Launched in 2007, Microsoft Unlimited Potential continues to be our company-wide  to use technology to help create opportunities and solve societal challenges. (US_Microsoft 2010)

N of-prepositional clause is the most common post-nominal construction in the Chinese letters, with the goal of sequence being the most frequent. For instance, Chinese letters use this cataphoric expression to guide readers in exploring the specific goal of companies (example 6). In contrast, the N to-infinitive clause is the most common post-nominal construction in the US letters, with the commitment to sequence (example 7) being the most frequent (50.48 occurrences per 100,000 words). In the case of (7), the US companies allow stakeholders to see commissive resolution of companies through encapsulating the semantic equivalence of commitment.

# 5.2. Interactional dimension of metadiscursive nouns

The interactional dimension of metadiscursive nouns concerns how CEOs express their stance (e.g., belief, effort, goal) and involve stakeholders as participants in the joint construction of CEO letters (e.g., tradition, context, knowledge), with an aim to construct trustworthy relationship with intended stakeholders (Fuoli, 2018). Table 5 displays the vast majority of metadiscursive nouns performing stance functions with $9 8 . 6 3 \%$ and $9 7 . 6 4 \%$ of instances occurring in the US and Chinese letters respectively. It is noteworthy that $5 2 . 9 5 \%$ and $6 0 . 4 0 \%$ of stance nouns in the US and Chinese discourse are respectively controlled by the post-nominal constructions.

Table 6 further displays the stance nouns in each corpus. Stance nouns are nearly twice as frequent in the US discourse as in the Chinese discourse. The two corpora employ the most ENTITY nouns, followed by ATTRIBUTE and RELATION nouns.

The most common stance choices involve reference to ENTITIES, with COGNITION nouns comprising a considerable proportion of metadiscursive nouns in both corpora. The US companies employ nearly 1.5 times of COGNITION nouns than their Chinese counterparts, demonstrating a highly significant difference $\mathrm { L L } = 3 0 . 6 4$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 5 8$ ). More specifically, both corpora show preference for COGNITION nouns characterising goals, although the noun goal is overwhelmingly employed in the US texts than in the Chinese ones $\mathrm { \Delta L L } = 3 7 . 2 6$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 1 . 2 4$ ). Considering that this noun is usually situated in the structure goal of, more than $9 0 \%$ of instances of this structure highlight macro goals in the Chinese letters, showing dedicated stance towards macro corporate responsibility goals (example 8). In contrast, $5 3 . 9 5 \%$ of instances describe specific sustainability goals in the US letters to express dedication, such as the percentage of reduction in emission (example 9).

(CN_Compal 2018) goal We are on track toward our  of a 15-percent reduction in emissions by 2017, from a 2012 baseline. (US_Morgan Stanley 2014)

Although Chinese companies employ fewer COGNITION nouns than their US counterparts in general, they use more COGNITION nouns revealing holistic thinking style (e.g., principle, philosophy). For instance, the occurrence of principle (11.83 occurrences per 100,000 words) is higher in the Chinese letters than in the US ones $\mathrm { L L } = 3 . 9 6$ , $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 8 7$ ). Compared with goal, principle is more likely to be linked with holistic thinking, as evidenced in its equivalents showing corporate values guiding the sustainable development of Chinese companies (example 10).

As for the other three sub-categories of ENTITY nouns, both corpora share the most common metadiscursive nouns in these sub-categories. More specifically, effort and commitment tend to highlight the committed attitudes of companies. All these nouns are overwhelmingly used in the US texts than in the Chinese texts. For example, the occurrence of effort in the US texts (52.28 cases per 100,000 words) is higher than that of all EVENT nouns in the Chinese texts (49.30 occurrences per 100,000 words).

In terms of ATTRIBUTE nouns, metadiscursive nouns depicting STATUS are the most frequent sub-category, which is significantly more used in the US discourse than in the Chinese one $\mathrm { . L L } = 5 6 . 3 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 1 . 1 0 $ ). STATUS nouns include nouns depicting epistemic, deontic, and dynamic modality. Epistemic modality relates to certainty and likelihood (e.g., likelihood, truth); deontic modality describes obligation and necessity (e.g., need, obligation); dynamic modality concerns ability, opportunity, and tendency (e.g., ability, potential) (Jiang, 2022). Chinese CEOs show preference for deontic modality $( 5 5 . 6 4 \% )$ , whereas the US CEOs rely heavily on dynamic modality $( 7 9 . 1 4 \% )$ . In other words, Chinese companies tend to highlight their responsibility (example 11) when communicating with stakeholders, whereas the US companies construct themselves as competent and energetic business practitioners through the substantial use of dynamic modality (example 12).

Apart from STATUS nouns, QUALITY nouns are of great importance in expressing corporate stance in CEO letters, as evidenced in the substantial use of metadiscursive nouns in both corpora (Table 6). Nouns in this group mainly evaluate “whether something is admired or criticized, valued or disparaged” (Jiang & Hyland, 2017, p. 9). The US letters significantly employ more QUALITY nouns to mark stance than the Chinese ones $\mathrm { \Delta L L } = 3 6 . 2 5 $ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 1 . 3 2$ ). It is worth mentioning that $5 6 . 3 6 \%$ and $5 8 . 9 6 \%$ of QUALITY nouns in the US and Chinese discourse convey a positive stance (e.g., value, importance, achievement), which is consistent with previous literature on CSR reports (e.g., Aiezza, 2015; Fuoli, 2012; Rajandran, 2016) and other forms of corporate communication (e.g., Crawford Camiciottoli, 2014; Fuertes-Olivera et al., 2001; Fuoli, 2018). The inclination to use positive language in CSR communication verifies the “Pollyanna Hypothesis” (Boucher & Osgood, 1969), which contends that there is a universal human tendency to use evaluatively positive words more frequently and diversely than evaluatively negative words in communicating.

MANNER is the least used sub-category of ATTRIBUTE nouns in CEO letters, which depicts how actions and states of affairs come into being (e.g., time, way, method). Table 6 demonstrates that the frequency of MANNER nouns in the US discourse (24.32 times per 100,000 words) is almost twice as frequent as in the Chinese discourse, showing a highly significant difference $\mathrm { L L } = 8 . 0 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 8 6 $ ). Further examination of the concordance lines reveals that approach is the most heavily used MANNER noun in the US discourse $\mathrm { { T L } } = 1 2 . 7 8$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 3 . 0 4$ ).

# 6. Discussion

Based on the above detailed corpus findings, two variations can be generalised in the overall use of interactive and interactional metadiscursive nouns between the US and Chinese discourse. First, more interactive metadiscursive nouns are employed in the US letters than in the Chinese ones, corroborating the findings of previous research (e.g., Huang & Rose, 2018). Second, substantially more interactional metadiscursive nouns are used in the US discourse in comparison to the Chinese one, which is consistent with previous cross-cultural studies in which Western companies use more interactional metadiscursive resources than their Chinese counterparts (Huang & Rose, 2018; Lee, 2020, 2021). The two discrepancies above are closely related to the variation in the high-low context continuum mingled with cultural values between the US and China.

In Beyond Culture, the anthropologist Edward Hall puts forward the high-low context continuum, arguing that any communication or transaction can be characterised as high- and low-context (Hall, 1976). While high-context transactions “feature preprogrammed information that is in the receiver and in the setting, with only minimal information in the transmitted message” (ibid., p. 101), low-context transactions suggest that “most of the information must be in the transmitted message in order to make up for what is missing in the context (both internal and external)” (ibid.). It has been observed that the US culture is toward the lower end of the scale, whereas China is on the high-context end of the scale (ibid., p. 91). A case in point is that the spoken pronunciation system of Chinese must be known, because there are four tones and a change of tone means a change of meaning. However, the reader doesn’t need to know how to pronounce English in order to read it (ibid., pp. 91–92). Hall’s high-low context continuum has inspired forthcoming cultural studies. For instance, Geert Hofstede has linked low-context communication with individualist culture, and high-context communication with collectivist culture (Hofstede et al., 2010).

# 6.1. Variation in the use of interactive metadiscursive nouns

The interactive metadiscursive nouns are twice as frequent in the US discourse as in the Chinese one, suggesting greater efforts invested in explicit cohesion in the US discourse. This mainly arises from the low-context culture reflected in the writer-responsible tradition in the West and hypotaxis of English.

More particularly, the low-context culture of the US typifies the “writer-responsible” rhetoric, saying that the US speakers or writers are inclined to shoulder “the responsibility to make clear and well-organized statements” (Hinds, 1987, pp. 143– 144), and to practice careful and explicit guidance (Mauranen, 1993). One of the explicit devices used to guide readers is connectives. When linking clauses, whether or not connectives are used “is most commonly regarded as the defining marker of parataxis and hypotaxis” (Tse, 2010, p. 354). “Parataxis” and “hypotaxis” are two important concepts in the study of contrastive linguistics between Chinese and English (Wang & Liu, 2020). Parataxis refers to languages such as Chinese specifying clausal relationship with less use of connectives, whereas hypotaxis indicates languages such as English preferring signal clausal relationship with connectives (Nida, 1982; Tse, 2010; Wang, 1954). The greater emphasis on connectives such as anaphoric and cataphoric linking in English gives rise to the heavier use of interactive metadiscursive nouns in the US discourse than in the Chinese counterpart.

In contrast, the less reliance on anaphoric and cataphoric linking in the Chinese discourse primarily arises from the high-context culture reflected in the reader-responsible rhetoric and the paratactic Chinese language. More specifically, highcontext communication relies more on receivers to understand senders; therefore, senders do not need to explain too much (Hall, 1976). In high-context culture like China, writers prefer “reader-responsible” rhetoric, highlighting “the responsibility of the listener (or reader) to understand what it is that the speaker or author has intended to say” (Hinds, 1987, pp. 143–144). The hearer/reader-responsible culture of China is closely related to the “parataxis language”, suggesting that Chinese tends to link clauses without using connectives to specify their relationships (Nida, 1982; Tse, 2010; Wang, 1954). The less reliance on connectives in Chinese impedes the deployment of metadiscursive nouns performing cohesive functions in the Chinese letters. Our finding also lends support to previous research in which metadiscourse is presumably less frequent in highcontext culture (Huang & Rose, 2018) related to reader-responsible tradition (Ädel, 2006).

# 6.2. Variation in the use of interactional metadiscursive nouns

Overall, the extensive use of interactional resources by the US companies than their Chinese counterparts is consistent with previous research findings. For instance, Lee (2020, 2021) explores the use of interactional metadiscursive expressions including hedges, boosters, and attitude markers between the US and Chinese CEO letters from annual reports, finding that these interactional resources are more commonly used in the US discourse. Similarly, Liu and Liu (2023) find that more attitudinal stance expressions are employed in the US CEO letters than in their Chinese counterparts.

The greater density of interactional metadiscursive nouns in the US discourse is embedded in the Anglo-American preference for using direct and explicit code to manifest one’s authenticity, which typifies low-context culture that the US is associated with (Hall, 1976). The low-context communication is closely related to individualist cultures (Hofstede et al., 2010), and values that “speaking one’s mind is a characteristic of an honest person” (ibid., p. 113). In other words, individuals are encouraged to express their own thoughts in the US society. Therefore, questioning others’ ideas and beliefs, evaluating received knowledge, and engaging in debate and formal argumentation are highly valued and respected in AngloAmerican culture (Hu & Cao, 2011; Lee, 2020; Peng & Nisbett, 1999). This tradition echoes Anglo-American business discourse which claims that one of the most important ways to effective business communication is to “offer compelling, persuasive arguments and recommendations (Thill & Bovee, 2017, p. 53). More actively engaging in critical interaction in the US thus gives impetus to the greater use of interactional metadiscursive nouns in the US discourse.

In contrast, the less use of interactional metadiscursive nouns in Chinese discourse epitomises the collectivistic highcontext Chinese culture. More specifically, the high-context communication relies on shared contexts, with very little being in the coded and explicit part of the information. This type of communication is frequently reflected in collectivist cultures (Hofstede et al., 2010). It has been argued that “harmony should always be maintained and direct confrontations avoided” (ibid., p. 103) in the collectivist society. The advocate for social stability and harmony has been rooted in ancient Chinese philosophies such as the Confucian value system (You, 2008). According to Confucius, “cunning arguments may result in conflict and hatred and that relations with cunning speakers may result in danger” (Ding, 2007, p. 154). In a similar vein, Daoism highlights nothingness by adopting a letting-go approach (Li et al., 2021). The Daoist classic Dao De Jing holds the view that “A good man does not argue; he who argues is not a good man. ” (Becker, 1986, p. 79).

Influenced by these philosophical traditions and specific cultural values, Chinese companies may be less inclined to express individual viewpoints, which in turn inhibits the use of interactional metadiscursive nouns in the Chinese corpus. The high-context collectivist culture in China has also been observed in other cross-cultural corporate discourse. Previous studies reveal that Chinese companies use more authoritative direct quotes to establish legitimacy and persuade stakeholders than their US counterparts, which highlights the collective identity of Chinese and seems to avoid expressing personal opinions directly (Bondi & Yu, 2018; Ngai et al., 2020).

A closer examination of the interactional dimension reveals that stance nouns account for the vast majority of interactional metadiscursive nouns $9 8 . 6 3 \%$ and $9 7 . 6 4 \%$ in the US and Chinese letters respectively) in both sets of discourse. Over a half proportion of stance nouns are controlled by the post-nominal constructions (the US: $5 2 . 9 5 \%$ , China: $6 0 . 4 0 \%$ . The US companies show greater preference for the use of Stance nouns $^ +$ post-nominal clauses than their Chinese counterparts. The preference for this structure by the US companies again reflects the low-context culture, which is also related to the linear topic-first writing style. With direct and clear code of information, people from the US tend to use English guided by the linear thought pattern (Kaplan, 1966). This is what Scollon and Scollon (2001) termed as deductive pattern. More specifically, in the deductive pattern, “the topic is introduced at the beginning so that it will be clear what the relevance of the supporting arguments is” (ibid., p. 87), which in turn gives rise to the use of stance nouns controlled by the post-nominal clause in the US discourse.

On the other hand, driven by the high-context communication in China, Chinese writing “is marked by what may be called an approach by indirection” (Kaplan, 1966, p. 10). Such indirect communicative style of Chinese leaders has also been observed by Ngai and Singh (2017) in comparison to the US leaders. This is also related to the inductive pattern which is done “by outlining the arguments and by testing the other participants for potential acceptance of the topic before introducing it” (Scollon & Scollon, 2001, p. 87). The topic-delayed convention in Chinese writing perhaps inhibits the use of stance nouns controlled by post-nominal structures in the Chinese discourse.

Apart from high-context and low-context divide, corporate practice and historical contexts of CSR disclosure also play a part in shaping the use of metadiscursive nouns. In the US, CSR reporting has come into practice in the 1990s (Tschopp, 2005). In China, however, it was not until 2006 that companies disclose CSR reports (Bhatia, 2012). With the longer history of CSR disclosure, the US companies are more likely to be familiar with writing CEO letters of CSR reports in a more interpersonal way through a more diversified use of metadiscursive nouns, in comparison to their Chinese counterparts.

To summarise, we have tried to explicate the variations in the density of interactive and interactional metadiscursive nouns from the perspective of cultural conventions between the US and China. It should be noted that adopting a “large culture” approach (Holliday, 1999) in this study does not mean the stability and homogeneity of national culture. Instead, national cultures are dynamic and heterogeneous in nature (Connor, 2002), shaped by the changing social and historical circumstances.

# 7. Conclusion

This study investigates metadiscursive nouns in the CEO letters of CSR reports from the US and Chinese companies. It has been found that the interactive metadiscursive nouns in the US texts is twice as common as the Chinese counterparts. The greater efforts on explicit cohesion in the US discourse are shaped by the writer-responsible tradition in English, whereas the less use of cohesive devices in the Chinese discourse is mainly due to the reader-responsible tradition in Chinese. In the interactional dimension, stance nouns are also twice as frequent in the US letters as in the Chinese ones. The greater density on nominal stance in the US discourse is primarily related to the low-context tradition in the West and the high-context tradition of China.

This research might be the first empirical study of metadiscursive nouns in the genre of CSR reports, echoing the importance of nominal resources in the metadiscourse repertoire (Hyland et al., 2022), and extending the checklist of metadiscursive nouns from academic discourse to CSR reporting genre. A robust descriptive basis for scrutinising CSR reporting has been provided, which helps the US and Chinese companies communicate across cultures based on their cultural values. By demonstrating the rhetorical roles of metadiscursive nouns, this study offers new perspectives on the impression management strategies that companies employ in CSR reports. Further, this study sheds new insights for the US and Chinese companies to write/translate English CEO letters in CSR reports. The fewer cohesive devices and stance expressions used in the Chinese texts may be less appealing to stakeholders accustoming to the more explicit communicative styles in AngloAmerican traditions. Conversely, the US texts may alienate reader valuing implicit communicative styles in Chinese culture. With the acceleration of globalisation, it is important for Western stakeholders to learn about Chinese rhetoric. Similarly, since the target readers of English CSR reports of Chinese enterprises are mainly international stakeholders, it is crucial for Chinese writers to take the cultural backgrounds of international readers into full consideration.

This study also has important pedagogical implications for both ESP instructors and practitioners. First, as evidenced in our study, metadiscursive nouns are indispensable rhetorical resources for creating cohesive texts, conveying authorial stance, engaging with readers, and therefore deserve greater pedagogical attention in ESP courses for students. More specifically, teachers can draw students’ attention to the gap in the use of metadiscursive nouns between them and experts. It is important to sensitise students to the flow of cohesive use and the rhetorical stance options revealed by these nouns in corporate discourse. Second, the corpus of CEO letters of CSR reports is a useful instructional material for students majoring in English for business purposes in the US and China. Based on the concordance lines generated from the discourse that students may be exposed to, business course designers can better tailor course designs and instructional exercises. Third, given that the use of metadiscursive nouns display various patterns in the US and Chinese CEO letters, teachers play an instructive role in raising learners’ awareness of cross-cultural contexts when using abstract nouns.

Admittedly, this study also has limitations which provide avenues for future research. First, the analysis is restricted to metadiscursive nouns controlled by the five common grammatical patterns. Future work might explore other grammatical realisation of metadiscursive nouns. Second, we mainly focus on how metadiscursive nouns, the non-congruent linguistic forms, create chains of reasoning (Halliday, 2004) in CSR communication. Subsequent research could investigate the use of metadiscursive nouns in connection with their corresponding congruent linguistic forms (e.g., reporting clauses) as explored by Wang and Hu (2023). Third, the interpretations of the findings and corresponding suggestions for the US and Chinese companies’ writing CEO letters of CSR reports are mainly based on corpus analysis. Insider information can be collected from expert scholars and specialist informants of the CSR practice to testify to our readings and suggestions on cross-cultural CSR reporting. Fourth, most English CEO letters from Chinese companies have been translated from Chinese. Future studies may build parallel Chinese-English corpus to observe how L1 factor influences the use of metadiscursive nouns. Finally, the sectors of companies selected in our corpora are unbalanced. Further research could investigate CEO letters from specific sectors to provide a more nuanced understanding of the findings.
