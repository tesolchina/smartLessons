# The Art and Architecture of Academic Writing, Patricia Prinz, Birna Arnbjornsdottir. John Benjamins (2021). 299, ISBN: 9789027207517

Of the four language skill, writing and speaking seem to present the most challenges to learners in the journey of mastering a foreign language. Writing, especilly writing for academic purposes, is not easy. One reason is that English academic texts conform structurally to native speaker logic, which i essentially linear in the development of thoughts and ideas (Lehman, 2018). This may be unfamiliar to second language learners. The publication of The Art and Architecture of Academic Writing will therefore be welcomed by novice writers of English as a Second Language (L2). Among composition manuals in SLA market, this new volume has is unique strength in providing astraightforward and easy-to-follow guide. Being reader-friendly, the book helps writers advance step by step to achieve their writing goals.

The book consists of two parts. Part I allowstudents to concentrate on writing practice to develop their own voice. Part I teaches students to develop research-based writing. Part I is uilt on Part I but they can be read separately. Students who write for general purposes wil find that Part is suficiet. Those who need  writ academic texts and have foundation inesay composition can skip Part I and go directly to Part II..

In the first two chapters, the authors lean on metaphors such as art and \*architecture, comparing writr to artists, and essay writing to work of art. The inroduction-body-conclusion organizational pattern resembles the building blocs in architecturalstructure. Organ. zational cues such as first or second" presents the blueprint or signpost for the esay. Making use of metaphorical images, lingustic terminologies such as "discourse', "genre', and \*connectors' are introduced in a way that is easily accessible to the reader.

From Chapter 3 on, to make the cycle of thesis-driven academic writing transparent and clear, the authors employ a simple but powerful framework, AwARE (Arranging to write, Writing, Assessing, Revising, and Editing). Throughout the book, a wealth of practices reinforces the application of AwARE to writing tasks from expository genre to casestudy, and eventually to aresearch paper. Students are guided towards completing the cycle to produce their works of art and build skill and confidence incrementally.

The first A" in AwARE, aranging to write, is often overlooked by novice writers. The importance of planning cannot be over. estimated. Seasoned writers spend time brainstorming because they know planning proves to quicken the actual process instead. "A well-designed plan will enable student-writers to move from conceptualization of an idea - to execution - and finally write-up' (Persaud, Devonish, & Persaud, 2019).

Unlike most writing manuals, this book i of the opinion that the inroduction and the conclusion can wait until the completion of the body. According to the authors, mastering body paragraphs is the foundation of effectie academic writing acrossall genres. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 put the AwARE framework to the test in Description and Narrative, Enumeration, Compare/Contrast and Cause/ Effect genres respectively. A simple mesage is made clear: all body paragraphs start with a topic sentence that contains a single controlling idea for the whole paragraph, and the rest of the paragraph develops the main point expressed in the topic sentence by providing adequate evidence. However, because this way of writing does not come naturall for many L2 writers, the authors use a myriad of graphs and tables to vividly represent the structure f body paragraphs and provide guided practice i effective strategies for constructing them. To implement the second " in AwARE, i.e, asesing the quantity and quality of evidence and the viabilit of the working thesi, students are advised to construct a reverse outlie, putting a working thesis and topic sentences of each paragraph to form a summary to see if the main ideas in each paragraph fit together to support the thesis statement.

Like planning, revising and editing are also often not given enough attention by novice writers. Experienced writers understand fully that rewriting produces the best writing. The authors point out where to look for when revising and editing by attaching detailed checklists, which are handy and practical.

After the completion of the body, the writer has aclearer idea about the information to be included in the inroduction and the content of the final message to be sent out in the conclusion. Chapter 7 introduces how to write an effective introduction and create a powerful conclusion. neffective introduction seres as a roadmap in preenting a thesis statement that tell the reader what to expect in the essay, while an efftive consio usull ide hrad thesis tment, a sythis f ice, ad n affimation f th snicanceor relevance of the topic. For reference purposes, a complete architecture of essays is given at the end of Part I (p.154)

Part I focuses on thesis-driven writing for two model assignments: a case study (Chapters 9-10) and a research paper (Chapters 11-12), based on a discussion of research methods and sources of data in Chapter 8. The same principles and strategies presented in Part I are applicable to writing the body of research-based assinment. The introduction in a case study and the litrature review in a research paper should provide enough relevant information for the audience. For instance, an effective literature review is not adata dump", instead, writers need to judiciously select data and synthesize them before their presentation (Samuels & Garbati, 2019). The conclusion needs to state the significance, implications and limitations of the study.

In academia, plagiarism has long been considered a serious violation of students' honesty. The authors recommend tools of using quotations, paraphrases and summary to avoid plagiarism. The APA format is also exemplified to cite sources both as in-text citations and as the reference list placed at the end of the text.

An outstanding feature of the book is interactive modules which are presented in different color blocs to engage students, such as 'reflection' in pink, \*practice' in blue, and \*relevance" in yellow, etc. It is also worth mentioning that the authors deliberately integrate a Reading to write section. What has changed over the past four decades of English for academic purposes (EAP) has been increased interest in the role of reading as related to writing. In academic contexts, students are not often asked to write without some kind of stimulus or input, usully in the form of reading materials (Hirvela, 2020). The provision of authentic reading material before writing relieves the students of anxiety and makes them feel less intimidated by the task they face.

In addition to writing tactics, linguistic competence needs to be boosted. At the end of Chapters 1 to 5 and Chapter 11, there is a section called "Expanding Language", addressing the most frequent grammatical errors among L2 writer, including punctuation, sentence fragments, non-count nouns, comma splices, and parallelism, etc. In addition, the authors offer abundant examples and exercises, not ltting the jargons deter the readers. Morover, precision in dictio is emphasized though i i no easy feat to achiee. The substantial improvement is only possble with intensive, extensive, and deliberate attention - and persistence (Hinkel, 2020)

A minor shortcoming is the lack of a preface and a section C in Chapter 4. It would ad value to the boo f sample esays and keys to the exercises were provided, though it may be beyond the scope of this volume. The supplement could be in the-version to benefit L2 writing teachers for class use or L2 writers for self-study. As publication in natural science becomes an increasing trend, reearchers urgently need to be well versed in expresing their work. It would be helpfulif the writing of a natural science paper were also to be analyzed and discussed.

All i all, The Art and Architecture of Academic Writing is a personal trainer for academic L2 writers at all levels. The authors have honed the ways to present a simplistic but powerful framework, AwARE,t train students to make organized writing. Throughout the book, the framework is applied over and over again until it becomes a habit As the saying goes, \*teach people to fish and you teach them for a life time". With the awareness and conscious efforts made to adopt and practice AwARE, even novice writer are likely to find L2 academic writing less daunting and complex.
