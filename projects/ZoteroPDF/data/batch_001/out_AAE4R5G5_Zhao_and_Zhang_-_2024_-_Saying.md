Keywords: Saying verbs Reporting patterns Research articles Evaluative function

This study, drawing upon Halliday's (1994) concept of the dual property of saying verbs, examines four types of reporting patterns of saying verbs in English research articles (RAs) within applied linguistics: (i) Sayer + V + reported clause, (ii) Sayer $+ \textbf { V } +$ noun phrase (NP), (iii) 'Sayer' (non-human) $+ \textbf { V } +$ reported clause, and (iv) Token $+ \textsf { V } + \Nu \mathrm { P }$ It aims to analyze their frequency, distribution, and evaluative functions. An analysis of 50 RAs reveals the following: firstly, pattern (iii) is the most prevalent, while pattern (ii) is the least utilized. Secondly, the semantic function of each pattern is primarily subject-dependent. Patterns with non-human subjects (patterns (ii) and (iv)) tend to attract boosting verbs, indicating a higher assurance of the truth value of propositions. Conversely, pattern (i), featuring human subjects, is inclined toward hedging verbs, offering a less certain indication of the factual state of the writer's interpretation. No distinct preference is observed in pattern (ii). These findings inform future research on the use of saying verbs in reporting patterns in academic writing and provide strategic instructions for teaching saying verbs in EAP classes.

# 1. Introduction

Meaning construction, whether oral or written, is a purposeful and intentional act of social interaction (Halliday, 1978; Hyland 2000). Academic writing, as a persuasive endeavor, involves a dialogic interaction between writers and readers (Bakhtin, 1981), moving beyond a simple presentation of cold, hard facts" (Bernhardt, 1985, p. 163). Writers engage in an ongoing scholarly debate in their writing proces. They present research findings by positioning themselves in relation to the topic in their disciplinary community While deploying rhetrical strategies to transform the findings into epistemic claims and persuade community members of their claims (Hyland, 2005; Hyland & Jiang, 2019; Hyland & Tse, 2005b). This proces integrates knowledge building (propositional dimension) with academic persuasion (non-propositional dimension), both essntial for effctive academic writing (Chen & Zhou, 2022) Extensive studies have focused on the interactive and dialogic nature of academic writing (e.g., Bakhtin, 1981; Groom, 2000; Hoey, 2001; Hyland & Jiang, 2017, 2020; Thompson & Ye, 1991).

Reporting expressions serve as an explicit means to introduce existent findings and distinguish writers research from previous work. It is one way by which the interactive and dialogic feature of academic writing can be achieved. The reporting structure comprises the reporting source (the subject), the reporting verb, and the reported message (the object). Decades of research in aca demic writing has focused on the choice of reporting sources (Charles, 2006a; Groom, 200; Hunston, 1993; Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005; Parkinson, 2013a; Thompson, 1994, 1996), reporting verbs (Hyland, 1998a, 1998b, 1999, 2000; Thomas & Hawes, 1994; Thompson & Ye, 1991), and the functions conveyed by both the sources and verbs. Research on reported messages has predominantly concentrated on analyzing reported clauses (Charles, 2006a, 2006b, 2007; Hyland & Jiang, 2019; Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005b; Man & Chau, 2019), with comparatively ess emphasis on those relized through NPs. Moreover, there has been even es exploration into how different selections of subjects and objects interact to create specific reporting patterns, conveying specific propositional information and authorial stances. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the interplay of subjects, verbs, and objects in reporting structures and their rhetrical functions, noting that meaning is asigned to pattens that encompassthee words, manifesting in the co-selection of words (Charles, 2006b; Hunston, 2008; Hyland, 2000; Yang & Wei, 2021). The rational llocation of these choices by writers largely affects idea presentation and text persuasiveness collectively contributing to the construction of the writer's identity and authority. Halliday (1994) and Hunston (2013) have explored the interactions between reporting sources and reported messages, under. scoring how these elements collectively shape the information presentation and authorial stances. Halliday (1994) highlights the dual property of saying verbs in general English, which can represent reporting congruently through a verbal process with either a human subject or a projectd clause as the oject (satisying one or both ondtions) (e.., 1) Mutiple archers have argued that .. (w9), 2) Lee (2007) showed an interaction betwee . (Es0L9), 3) This difference would seem to sugest that . (APL5), or metaphorically through a relational proces that requires both a non-human subject and a nominal group as the object (e.g., 4) ELF research articles show greater relince on .. (JEAP3). In the subsequent paragraph, we will delve into the concept of saying verbs, asutilized in our study.

Hunston (2013) examines the interaction between reporting verbs and their subjects and objects, pointing out the connection between authorial attitude and grammatical pattern, with certain lexis-grammar combinations being preferred over others. The concealing of personal involvement and the eision of process transitioning from the above examples 1) to 4), shows aspectrum from "more to les overt subjectivity, and more to les congruence (Hunston, 2013, p. 632), reflecting a gradual weakening of the writer's responsibility and commitment to the proposition. Although Halliday's and Hunston's studies offr invaluable insights, their research lacks extensive authentic examples to validate pattern variations and does not primarily focus on academic texts.

In Halliday's Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), saying verbs (e.g., say, blame, argue, report, suggest) serve to enact verbal processes for conveying information or opinions, playing a pivotal role in communication. While Halliday primaril explores them in the context of general English, our study focuses on their usage in academic writing, where their selection and usage may vary. In academic writing, saying verbs, such as show, suggest demonstrate, report, and arge form a key subset of reporting verbs for conveying speech or reporting ideas, theorie, observations, or findings. Critical for conveying information, constructing argument, and linking writers' ideas with those of ther reearchers, their usage ilustrates how writers participate in ongoing scholarly debates, enhancing and reinforcing their perspectives within these conversations and disputes. Therefore, the selection of saying verbs extends beyond mere grammatical choice, functioning as a pivotal element in academic communication and the establishment of writers' scholarly identity and authorit. Halliday and Matthessen (2014) note the key role of verbal' clauses in academic iscours for reporting on other scholars and writers themselves while showing the writers' stance. This paper explores the interaction between the reporting sources and reported messages in saying verbs in English RAs of applied linguistics. Its objective is to reveal the distribution and attitudinal representations across different reporting patterns.

This paper unfolds as follows. First, we inroduce the dual property of saying verbs in Halliday (1994), followed by a brief review of existing research on reporting in academic writing. Then, we present the procedures and methodology for constructing the RA corpus. Next, we elaborate on the data, focusing on the frequency, distribution of the four reporting patterns, and their discourse functions. Finally, we summarize this study, outline its implications, and recommend future research directions.

# 2. Previous research on reporting in academic writing

Reporting discourse in academic writing extends beyond information transmission. It involves active participation in scholarly dialogue. This proces validates new findings, incorporating them into existing knowledge framework, and establishes the writer's position within the academic community. Reflexivity stands out as its most fundamental feature, empowering writers not only to relay statements but also to evaluate, critique, and question them, thereby guiding readers interpretations as intended (Sakita, 2002). Ths reflexive nature fosters active participation in and contribution to the scholarly conversation, underlining the intrinsic link between reporting and evaluation (Thompson & Ye, 1991).

# 2.1. The four patterns of saying verbs

Projection, a manifestation of a logical-semantic relationship, is a central grammatical area associated with idea representation in SFL (Halliday, 1994, pp. 250-273). It involves the projecting clause and the content. In this proces, the content is proected through the projecting clause, establishing it either as a locution in a verbal clause of saying or an idea in a mental clause of sensing. SFL situates reporting within the projection system, and verbal proces is an important way to realize projection. Academic discourse, known for its wellinformed topic and evidence-based development, heavily relies on reporting to articulate its arguments.

Halliday (1994) expands the study of saying verbs into a broader research context, describing saying as covering \*any kind of symbolic echange of meaning (p. 140) and noting that verbal proceses shade into the symbolic type of relational proces (p. 141) He identifies saying vers like imly, indae, shw, demonstate ify, and sugst as possessing adual propert, functionng thr as verbal proceses (saying) or as relational processes (being (a sign of) Building on Halliday's concept of the dual property of saying verbs, this paper delineates four reporting patterns of saying verbs.: i) Sayer + V + reported clause e., Skehan (1998) argues that.. (JSLW7), (ii) $\mathbf { S a y e r + V + N P }$ (e.g., Serikbolsyn ... Demonstrates the theoretical implications of .. (TEsOL2), (iii) Sayer $^ { \cdot 5 } + \nabla +$ reported clause (e.g., The quantitative results show that ... (JEAP3), and (iv) Token + $\mathsf { V } + \mathsf { N P }$ (e.g., The results showed notable differences in ... (WRC3). Patterns (i) (ii) an (i) ar constructed congruently, characterizing verbal processes where either the suject (in active voice) is aconscious agent, the object is projecting, or both conditions are satistied, roughly meaning saying something. Conversely pattern (iv) i constructed metaphorically and used for a relational proes, with the subject being a non-human agent and the object realized by an NP. This patern istructured as Token Value, roughly meaning being a sign of'. The shift from verbal process to relational processhelps to reconstrue human experience, turing congruent processes (that or wh-projected clauses) into static entities (nominal groups), as in examples 5a) and 5b), with an invented paraphrase given in 5b).

5) a. We used thee two indices to set up two ferent CFAs . Bcause they each demonstated the strongest corrlation among allindices considered with the writing quality of one genre. (APL10) b. We used these two indices o set up two different CFAs .. Because they each demonstrated that they correlate most strongly with the writing quality of one genre among all indices considered.

The use of the same saying verb across the four reporting patterns varies along two dimensions: the choice of subjects and objects. Subjects can be nominal groups denoting human speakers or symbolic sources, and objects can be projected clauses or nominalizations. Halliday and Martin (1993) similarly observed that verbs like show, ilustrate, sugest indicate, etc. Function in both verbal and relational processe. The above discussions reveal the complexit of saying vers and how diffrent subjec-object configurations impact propositional expression.

# 2.2. The rhetorical functions of reporting clauses

Research in academic reporting shows considerable variations in selecting proposition sources (human, non-human, and imper. sonal it),verb types indicating epistemic status (factive, non-factive), and propositional content (projected clauses or NPs). These elements allow writers to assespropositions' epistemic status and weave these assessments into complex arguments or narrtives, favoring some lexis-grammar configurations over others (Hunston, 2013). Textual ideas are shaped by writers' selective processes, evolving their stance through reporting choices (Groom, 200; Halliday & Mathiesen, 2014). Writers embed chosen information, attitudes, and positions, dynamically modulating the dialogue space by utilizing various grammatical forms, thus guiding readers attitudes and fostering a value coalition (Hunston, 2013; Hyland, 2005). These strategic choices mirror the discipline'seistemology, steering information toward established values (Hyland & Tse, 2005b).

This study, based on Halliday's (1994) four reorting patterns, focuses on subjects as either human or non-human entities in active voice) and objects as ether projected clause or NPs. Theensuing discussion examines the subject object, and ver to understand these reporting dynamics.

# 2.2.1. The source of the proposition

The subject represents the knowledge source. Writers consistently opt for the most persuasive sources to substantiate their argu. ments to the disciplinary community (Hunston, 1993; Parkinson, 2013b).

The choice from human to non-human subjects represents a spectrum, indicating more to les overt explicitnes of human agent expression (Holmes & Nesi, 2009), and mirrors writers \*more to les overt subjectivity" (Hunston, 2013, p. 632). Human subjects enhance researcher visibility, emphasizig their role in opinions and decisions, personalizing narratives, and assigning direct responsibility. Conversely, non-human subjects demphasize this visbility, focus on research outcomes, and shift responsibilit to research entities (e.g, euls, metods, recent analyses by Yoon and Polio (2016), thus diminishing bias and obscuring responsibility. It is important to note that any visibility or responsibility is assigned by the writer.

Research indicates that writers often strive to minimize personal involvement in academic writing, commonly achieved through th use of impersonal subjects (Hunston, 2013; Hyland, 1998b, 2000; Hyland & Jiang, 2017; Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005b; John, 2009; Parkinson, 2013b). Agentes textual representations help to base judgments on procedures or data, minimizing the writer's inter. pretative responsibility and creating a sense of objectivity by relying on external evidence rather than personal judgment (Hyland, 1998a, 200). Hyland and Jiang (2017) discuss how such selferadication in academic persuasion grants the research direct engagement with readers, minimizing medation to "maximize the credibilit of the writer and elict credence from the reader (p. 45). Conversely, using personal sources indicates reliance on individual judgment,carifying overt personal responsibility and the provisionality of the claim (Hyland, 2000).

# 2.2.2. The contents of the proposition

The object, representing reporting content, varies from full clauses to NPs, indicating a spectrum from \*more to less congruence" and showing the writers commitment to the propositions (Hunston, 2013, p. 632). This variation also reflects how writers positin themselves within their discourse community (Holmes & Nesi, 2009).

The rhetorical significance of using that or wh-clauses as objects is wellestablished in academic writing (Biber, 2006; Hunston, 2013; Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005b; Man & Chau, 2019; Mur-Duenas, 2021; Parkinson, 2013a, 2013b), aiding writers in evaluating claims and establishing positions. Termed as evaluative tat-constructions by Hyland and Tse (2005a, 2005b) and stance complement that-clauses by Biber (2006), that-clauses thematize evaluation by porraying attitudinal meaning as an independent proposition, framing it as the perspective for interpreting the proposition, and enabling potential for further elaboration and explicit evaluation (Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005b). Hunston (2013) notes their frequent use in situations requiring fulle exposition and overt ssessment, presenting knowledge as \*in the processof formation (p. 617). Furthermore, packaging information in clauses alows researchers to distance themselves from the content, thereby rendering the information appear more objective and shielding themselves from responsibility for the proposition's truthfulness (Parkinson, 2013a, 2013b).

Nominalized forms (., ffordances, applicabilit, usefunes, reliblity) are a key mechanism for expanding the meaning-making resources in language and are vital for constructing knowledge in academic writing (Halliday & Martin, 1993). First, the packaged metaphorical thing' (a nominal group) strips participant roles and processes and foregrounds things and relations, thereby bolstering writers arguments and rendering them les open to challenge (Bloor & Bloor, 2004; Halliday, 1994, 1998; Hunston, 2013; Hyland & Jiang, 2021). Bloor and Blor (2004) state that the nominalization of proces objectifies scientific knowledge, separating it from its researchers and "facilitat [ing] the expression of general truths and clams' about the nature of the world (p. 215). Their examples illustrate this (p. 214): Moorehead described the journeys of Bruce explicitly states the agent (Moorehead) and its content (the jouneys of Bruce), whereas The descrition i incomplete use ominlization (decrtion), omiting the original agent and specific content to enter attention on the event itself This reflects the objectivit inscientific writing, emphasizing facts and downplaying action attribution. Hunston (2013) notes that the verb-noun pattern elides the interpretative procesof aproposition, especially when its content i an accepted fact not requiring further discussion, thus symbolizing knowledge as "in a state of completion'" (p. 617). Hunston (p. 626) exemplifies this with.

6) a. ... Cambrian foils, when scrutinized in detail, often show afiliations to some existing animal group b. ... Scrutiny of Cambrian fossils often shows that they are affiliated to some existing animal group.

The shift from affliat in 6b) to affliation in 6a) signifies aceptance of the proposition without necesstating further explanation. Second, the concisenes of NPs suits the informational density and space constraints of academic writing (Biber e l., 2011; Halliday, 1989, 2004). Furthermore, NPs as objects also cary significant semantic load in forming scientificarguments (Bloor & Bloor, 2004; Halliday, 1994; Hyland & Jiang, 2021). They transform processes into nouns, seting the stage for these nouns to become themes of subsequent processes and facilitating the gradual development of arguments. Halliday (1994, p. 353) exemplifies this with alcohol impairment, aconstruction that leaves open interpretations such as acohol impairs or alohol is impaired, thus enabling the nominalized entity to further organize information.

# 2.2.3. The controlling verb

Reporting verbs are one of the clearest signals of evaluation in academic writing (Thompson & Ye, 1991), signifying writers epistemic ste as crtaty ., shw, dnstrte, reel), teivs (, sugt, indcte, my), d ntrlit (e, , t assert. Hyland (1998a, 2000) label verbs that convey certainty a boosting verbs and those that express uncertainty as hedging verbs. These verbs give writers options to display their degree of confidence in a proposition's truth and fine-tune their judgments from tentativenes to certainty (Hunston, 2013; Hyland, 1998a, 200; Myers, 1992; Thompson, 1994). Hyland (200) llustrates how using uncertain verbs with non-human subjects, like Thee dat ugest that . (p. 94), can disguise writers interpretative responsibility and commitment, whereas 'certain' verbs, often with non-human subjects, like This unambiguously shows that .. (p. 97), emphasize the proposition's validity and suggest a strong data-findings correlation.

The above discussion indicates that the manipulative aspect of reporting patterns in academic discourse mainly involve the source of knowlege, the manner of introducing the reported message, and the extet to which the reorters attitude is explictly or implicitly conveyed. Through these discussions, the connection between authorial attitudes and grammatical forms surrounding propositions is clearly borne out. As Hunston (2013) points out, the sift from human to non-human subjects and from full lauses to NPs reflects a progression of the writer's mediation of the propositio. Undoubtedy, thi iterature is crucial for understanding how language reports facilitate information dissemination, knowledge establishment, and stance expression in academic discourse The findings suggest that the strategic use of reportig pattrns in English academic writing deserves specialattention. Additionall, the readth and diversit f litature in this fied rflets the omplexty f rorti prcties, which i t, pes chlleng for acdemi witers in prforming them effectively.

A promising way of addressing these issues i from a pattern perspective, as such recurrent lexis-grammar combinations can be readily used by researchers in their academic writing. Whilestudies like those by Biber (2006) and Biber e al. (2011) have identified alient rerr patterns in aadmic writen gres, ittleattempt so far has ben made  study rorting from  atten prsective, with few exceptions (Charles, 2006b; Hunston, 2013). One of the achievements of these studies is their emphasis on the strategic selection of subjects and object fr viewpoint representation and how they interact with grammatical forms to expres writer attudes. However, the dynamic interplay and pattern formation between subject and object choices remain underexplored. This study, building on Halliday's (1994) four types of reporting patterns, aims to fill this gap.

As discussed previously, Halliday's (1994) examination of saying verbs does not delve into their dual property within academic contexts. Considering the prominent role of verbal process clauses in scientific language, it is reasonable to anticipate analogous reporting patterns in academic discourse. Distinguishing the dual property of saying verbs i crucial to uncovering textual layout strategies. Thus, this study extends the understanding of saying verbs' dual property by exploring how scholars deploy the four reporting patterns to represent ideas and construct authorial stance in English RAs. The findings will enhance knowledge of the rhetorical functions of reporting clauses. It centers on two questions.

1) What is the distribution of the four reporting patterns of saying verbs in English applied linguistics research articles? 2) What are the distinct linguistic functions and rhetorical purposes served by each of the four reporting paterns in English applied linguistics research articles?

# 3. Material and methods

We examine the utilization of the four types of reporting patterns through authentic instances extracted from 50 applied linguistics RAs. The analysis involves two primary phases: first, extracting saying verbs, and then annotating the four reporting pattrns. A detailed method description follows.

# 3.1. Collection of RAs

We randomly sampled 50 RAs from 2015 to 2022across five prestigious peer-reviewed international journals in applied linguistics with 10 articles selected from each journal. These artices were accessed online through our Universtysinstitutional account. The journals were Aplied Linguisic, Jounal of English for Academic Purposes, Journal of Second Language Writing, TEsOL Quarterl, and Written Communication, coded as APL, JEAP', JSLW, TESOL, and WRC' respectively. To streamline subsequent analysis, each article was asigned a reference code from 1 to 10, such as APL1 and JEAP2, based on the download order. Non-research articles, including book reviews, notes, and letters, were excluded. The timeframe of 2015-2022 was deliberately selected to mitigate the impact of diachronic changes on our analysis.

We devote our attention to RAs, recognized for their distinct role in academic discourse and considered by scholars such as Hyland (1998b), Fang et al. (2021), and others as valuable templates for newcomers to academic writing. To address the complexities of language use variations acros disciplines (Durrant, 2017; Hyland, 2008), we narrow our focus to a single discipline. Our selection of applied linguisics is motivated by its distinct emphasis on interpretation and discursive persuasion (Holmes & Nesi, 2009; Hyland 2000; Hyland & Tse, 2005a) - a contrast to the experimental orientation of hard-knowledge disciplines, which leads to a more varied use of reporting structures that indicate what people say (Hyland & Jiang, 2019, 2021). Our familiarity with the discipline also influences our decision.

The selection of five different journals ensures both topic diversity and the preseration f linguistic commonalitie, reducing biases associated with journal specificties. To minimize the influence of authors idiosyncratic styles, as highlighted by Zhang and Cheung (2023), no RA author was included more than once in our sample. Researchers' first language backgrounds were not diffrentiated. given that expertise, rather than 1 tatus, is the primary criterion for intenational publicatin (e.g., Hu & Cao, 2011; Trible, 2015). These considerations, ranging from genre and disciplinary focus to journal specifics and authorial styles, colectively guarantee a highly representative sample for our study, making it a reliable reference for academic writing instruction within the fied of applied linguistics.

The whole articles were used, excluding front mattr, tables, images, figures, acknowledgements, references, and appendixes, resulting in a total corpus word count of 406,755 (details in Appendix A).

# 3.2. Procedures

This section details the extraction of saying verbs and the annotation of four reporting patterns.

Step 1: Extraction of saying verbs.

To annotate the four reporting patterns it is essential to compile a comprehensive list of academic saying verbs, considering their absence in existing research. This task unfolded in two phases: annotating known saying verbs and manualy identifying new ones as elaborated below.

Initially, we compiled alist of high-frequency saying verbs based on seminal studies by Halliday and Marti (1993), Halliday (1994), and insights into high-frequency reporting verbs indicative of saying' actions by Charles (2006a), Holmes and Nesi (2009), and Hyland (2000). Ultimately, we curated 12 key saying verbs: imply, indicat, show, demonstrate, signify, sugest, reveal ilustrate, confirm, report, state, and discuss, all carefully verified for their appropriateness by two researchers.

Then, using Foxit Reader (version 11.1.2), a versatile PDF processing tool whichoffers functions such as document reading, editing searching, and annotating, we employed its Search and Highlight feature to locate the 12 pre-established saying verbs. Firstly, we entered each verb into the search bar and selected Highlight al found items'. Upon clicking Search', we reviewed each concordance line for verb usage, ticking only verb uses (noting that show, report, and stat can also be nouns), with additional context checks for accuracy. Finall, by clicking Highlight, the verbs were highlighted in the text. We entered each verb in present, past, and past participle forms, treating British and American spellings (eg, hypothesize/hypothesize, emphasize/emphasize) as separate queries to captureall variations. This semi-automated proces streamlined manual identification effrt, fcusig on unmarked text portions for more eficient and accurate detection of aditional saying vers. This procedure allows for precise identification of the four reorting patterns, facilitating an effective analysis of their distribution and use in RAs of applied linguistics.

After semi-automatically rerieving the 12 pre-established saying verbs, we manually searched for additional potential saying verbs using Foxit Reader. This phase involved detaled line-by-line review, focusing on verb usage while intentionally excluding nouns or adjective forms. Words like highlight, note, and clam, which can function as nouns, and mean and signal, useable as nouns and ad. jectives, were excluded. When ncessary, the context was carefully examined to ensure acurate identification, ultimately dding 51 saying verbs to our list.

In both semi-automated retrieval and manual identification phases, we targeted saying verbs in finite reporting clauses. We excluded verbs from quoted excerpts, as they often reflect quoted author's voice rather than RA writers' voice, which is our primary focus. Additionall, verbs in passive constructions and instances with it as the introductory subject were excluded because our study focuses on the four reporting patterns with svo (Subject-Verb-Object) active voice constructions. Instances missing that complementizer were also included. Additionally, two spelling errors were corrcted and highlighted in yellow in the online dataset.

To eliminate potential idiosyncrasy, only verbs appearing in at least two texts were included. After excluding 10 single-occurrence verbs from the 51 manually identified, we combined the remaining 41 with the initial 12,finalizing a list of 53 saying verbs (lemmatized) (See Fig. 1).8

Step 2: Pattern extraction and annotation.

After identifying the saying verbs, we annotated their occurrences within the four reporting patterns via Foxit Reader. Each of the 53 verbs concordance lines was extracted and manually anotated with different colors assigned to each pattern: green for pattern (i) blue for patter (i), red forpatter (ii), and ellow forpattern (iv) Each instance was counted separately. Sentences connected by conjunctions such as and, or, but, as well as, not only .. But also were counted as two patterns.

To avoid polysemy or homonyms, only those items used as verbs and performing "saying" functions were annotated. Thus the pattern annotation process was conducted with close contextual crutiny and careful investigations in the wider context to filter out extraneous cases, making up for the lack of precision in automatic searches. For instance, note in example 7) was coded for mention something in order to draw people's atention to it', whereas note in example 8) was removed because it meant become aware of something' rather than 'saying'.

7) He further notes that student writers seldom use them, and they are more frequently found in hard sciences. (JSLW6) 8) Flowerdew and Forest (2015: 2) also note this complementary relationship between a metadiscursive noun and what Winter (1992: 153) calls a lexical realisation'. (APL4)

The analysis culminated in a total of 2264 reporting patern instances, systematically documented in an Excel spreadsheet for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The spreadsheet clearly delineates each instance with columns categorizing subjects, verbs, objects, and reporting pattern types, among others. The complete list is available in the online dataset.

It is noteworthy that our study included both that and wh-complement clauses (e.g., how, why), despite Halliday (1994) primarily demonstrating the former, owing to their shared syntactic and pragmatic functions. They function syntactically as verb complements and pragmaticall to provide additional information or complete the propositional content of sentences. Hunston (2013) also high. lighted the how-clause as an alternative to the that-clause. However, wh-complement clauses are notably low, with only 104 instances, accounting for only $8 . 6 4 \%$ of all clauses as objects.

During data annotation, uncertainties about word meaning and behaviour were resolved using the online Cambridge Dictionary (https://ictionary.cambridge.org and Collins Dictionary (http:/www.collinsdictionary.com). The two authors also discussed their decisions in order to reach consensus. The data was coded twice over different periods, followed by a review of all coded frames to ensure coding consistency.

# 4. Results and discussion

Overall, the data yielded a total of 53 different saying verbs' and a total number of 2264 instances (45.28 occurrences per text) Section 4.1 explores the distribution and discourse functions of the four reporting paterns in RAs of applied linguistics. Section 4.2 delves into the epistemic meanings of high-frequency saying verbs within each reporting pattern, further iluminating the discourse functions of the four patterns.

# 4.1. Distribution and discourse function of the four reporting patterns

Table 1 presents the frequencies of the four patterns in the corpus: 367, 280, 837, and 780 respectively, highlighting pattern (ii) and (iv) as most common in RAs and patter (i) as least used. Examples 9) to 12) ilustrate instance of patterns (i) to (iv) in the RA corpus, with an invented paraphrase given in 12b) of example 12a). We created example 12b) to beter contrast the functional differences between the shift from verbal to relational processes, as our corpus lacked a direct comparison within the same context.

The shift from example 12b) to 12a) moves from a verbal to a relational proces, nominalizing the process and omitting is participants. This weakens the responsibility for action and focuses more on events than on attributing responsibility.

The results in Table 1 indicat that in RAs of applied linguistics, writers most often choose pattern (ii), where verbs co-occur with non-human subjects and clause objects, while pattern (ii) with human subjects and NP objects is the least favored. This variance is explained through the dimensions of subject and object, functionally depicted as the evaluative source and evaluated entity, respectively, in Hyland and Tse (2005a, 2005b).

4.1.1. Evaluative sources: what kind of subjects the writer chooses

Firstly, in subject choices, comparing pattern (i) (Sayer $\cdot + \nabla +$ reported clause) and pattern (iii) ('Sayer' $+ \textrm { V } +$ reported clause) reveals non-human subject are over twice as frequent as human ones when object are that or wh-clauses. Likewise, a comparison of pattern (ii) $( \mathrm { S a y e r + V + N P } )$ with pattern (iv) $( \mathrm { T o k e n } + \mathbf { V } + \mathbf { N P } )$ indicates a similar trend: non-human subjects nearly triple human subjects when objects are NPs. This trend indicates that writer of RAs of applied linguisics prefer non-human entities regardless of whether the object is a clause or an NP.

The strategic use of non-human subjects in academic writing underscores a trend toward enhancing the objectivity and credibility of propositions. Halliday and Martin (1993) highlight a shift from personal to impersonal projections, noting the growing trend of depersonalization, a iew supported by Hyland and Tse (2005a, 2005b) who observed its considerable useacross disciplines, especially in soft fields. John (2009) further notes atrend of concealing the "sayer' in verbal processes, thus reducing writer visibility.

The preference for non-human subjects by writers can often be linked to the objectivity that these subjects impart, serving as a strategy to ensure propositional objectivity and enhance aceptance by minimizing personal involvement. Hyland (1998a, 1998b) demonstrates that using inanimate subjects conceals the interpreting agent, suggesting actions independent of the researcher and emphasizing that \*truth is discovered, not constructed' (Hyland, 2000, p. 94). Parkinson (2013b) reinforces the idea that the domi nance of non-human subjects in RAs, which projects objectivity, greatly aids in making propositions more convincing to readers and enhancing credibilit. By adopting this strategy in RA writing, writers make their statements seem evidence-derived, positioning themselves as credible community members, thus enhancing their work's persuasiveness and acceptability.

4.1.2. Evaluated entities: what kind of objects the writer chooses

This sub-section examines object choices across reporting patterns. Comparing pattern (i) (Sayer $+ \textrm { V } +$ reported clause) and pattern (ii) $( \mathrm { S a y e r + V + N P } )$ , a preference emerges for that or wh-clauses over NPs as objects when subjects are human. Similarly, between pattern (iii) ('Sayer' $+ \lor +$ reported clause) and pattern (iv) $( \mathrm { T o k e n + V + N P } )$ , clauses slightly outpace NPs with non-human subjects. Consequently, the results reveal a general preference for using fll reported clauses over NPs as objects in RAs of applied linguistics, irrespective of the subject being human or non-human.

This preference for using full reported complement clauses, echoing Hyland and Tse's (2005b) findings in applied linguistics and other fields, gains further support from research by Parkinson (2013b) and Man and Chau (2019), highlighting its prominence in academic writing.

Three primary factors drive the preference for clauses as objects. Firstly, that or wh-clauses create pace for writers to elaborate on propositions and expres their stance more explicitl. Biber (2006) highlights their dstinct explicitness among the three grammatical devices for expressing stance i., words, phrases, and clauses). Parkinson (2013b) views that complement clauses as powerful for conveying personal emotions, atitudes, and evaluations. Mur-Duenas (2021) dds that the use f verb-that complement clauses leaves space open for different results or arguments that may come in the future' (p. 8).

Secondly, this structure alows researchers to distance themselves from the proposition by encapsulating information in a subor. dinate clause. This practice reduces their association with the proposition, enhancing objectivity and circumventing personal accountability (Parkinson, 2013a, 2013b).

Thirdly, the argumentative and interpretative nature of soft disciplines, as observed by Hyland (1998b, 2000) and Hyland and

Jiang (2017, 2021), encourages using clauses for a more interpretive and disputational argument style, encouraging reader engagement and challenges to interpretations.

In applied linguistics RA writing, clause objects turn propositions into open invitations for elaboration rather than accredited facts. This approach not only broadens the dialogic space but also expands the evaluative potential, implying that opinions evolve through ongoing negotiation. It invites readers to assess and question, fostering an inclusive relationship and a receptive reader atitude.

As Table 1 shows, pattern (iv) with NPs as objects is the second most common, indicating NPs are also frequently used as objects when subjects are non-human in RAs of applied linguisics. This result fit in with Zeng and Liang's (2007) findings on the frequent use of metaphorical projections (e.,congruent process into static entities (NPs) in academic writing, sugesting that such strategies are deliberately chosen and valued by writers.

The high usage of pattern (iv) with NPs as objects, constituting $3 4 . 4 5 \%$ , relates to the rhetorical power of metaphorically projected NPs to simplify and solidify arguments in academic writing. By abstracting participants and processes it diminishes the room for dispute and presents argments in a more definitive esscontestable manner (Blr & Blo0r, 2004; Halliday, 1998; Halliday & Martin, 1993; Hyland & Jiang, 2021). Hyland and Jiang (2021) explain that bunding complex information into simpler structures gives propositions a semblance of objective reality and explanatory authority, limiting negotiation space and aligning readers with the writer's stance, which helps to construct an authoritative persona. For instance, the nouns importance and validity in example 13) present the proposition as validated facts, implying that the findings are objectively given rather than human-generated.

13) These results highlight the importance and validit of holistic syntactic measures in asessments of L2 written texts. (JEAP8)

Moreover, NPs simplicty and density allow for concise complex information delivery, valuable in the succinct RA genre (Halliday, 1989, 2004; Hyland & Jiang, 2021). Additionally, the compact nominal form, carrying thematic and informational value, facilitates further elaboration as a theme (Halliday, 1994; Halliday & Martin, 1993; Hyland & Jiang, 2021). Halliday (1994) emphasies it role in scientific discourse, making it posible "to develop an argument step by step (p. 353). For instance, transforming alcohol impairs to alcohol impairment, as discussed in section 2.2.1 converts a process-expressing verb into a noun, alowing its integration into other clauses, thereby further organizing information.

Lastly, the genre of selected academic papers impacts the preference for pattern (iv) with NPs as objects. Halliday and Martin (1993) and Hliday (1994) highlight the scientific register as deeply reliant on grammatical metaphor, where nominalizing proceses are key for articulating scintific knowledge. This metaphorical usage \*tends to mark off the expert from those who are uninitiated" (Halliday, 1994, p. 353), thus nsitatig oriented gidance fr students in scieific writing. Successful acadmic writing hinges not just on using ready-made nominalizations but also on the ability to disill complex clause-driven information into tailor-made nominalized forms (Thompson, 2010).

The above discussions about the characteristics of subjects and objects in written academic Englis clarify why patter (ii) is the most frequently used, fllowed closely by pattern (iv), with pattern (i) the least favored. As highlighted, in RA writing, there is a preference for non-human subjects and clause object, making pattern (ii the mostcommon due to fulflling both these criteria Conversely, patter (i) mets neither conditio, resultig in its minimal usage, as a subjective human subject rarely projects factual propositionsefftively. Paen (i) and (i) stisfying oe critrion each, fall betwen thee extremes. The preernce for paten (iv) over pattrn (i) may stem from the academic genre we analyzed, where the use of grammatical metaphors signifies efective RA writing, evidenced by our corpus from renowned international journals. Coupled with their impersonal subjects, a crucial factor in determining reporting patterns semantic function (discussed in section 4.2), it's unsurprising that their usage ranks just elow patten (ii).

The variation in the distribution of reporting pattrns may also be attributed to verbs inherent preferences for certain subjects or objects. An analysis of 53 verbs regarding their subject (human, non-human, or both) and object types that-complement clause, whcomplement clause, an NP, or all types) revealed that all verbs accommodate human and non-human subjects and accept NPs as objects. However, 8 verbs have restrictions on their complement use, with each appearing fewer than 10 times in the corpus, collectively contributing to only $1 . 6 8 \%$ of total verb occurrences, as detailed in Appendix B. Thus, this indicates that the distribution of reporting patterns is more about writers' rhetorical choices than the syntactic constraints of the verbs.

Disciplinary influences suggest reporting patterns differ acros fields: soft disciplines often prefer tentative verbs (eg., argue, conclude) for argumentation, while hard disciplines favor verbs of certainty (e.g., show, prove) tied to experimental evidence, emphasizing the researcher's concrete actions. This study centers on applied linguistics RAs, suggesting future research to explore these variations across disciplines for a broader understanding.

This section has primarily discussed the distribution and usage of the four types of reporting patterns in RAs. Grounded in findings from prior studies, we detailed the preferred choices of propositional sources and contents within these patterns.Following Hyland (2000), meanings do not reide in the items themselves (p. 89) but are insted the result f the co-selection of linguistc features in a pattern. We, therefore, hypothesize that the degree of certainty or authorial commitment expressed by subjects and objects in each pattern wil significantly influence the verb choice. For example, patern (iv), with non-human subjects denoting objective knowledge source and NP object indicating factual status, may attract factive verbs, whereas patterns (i), featuring human subjects signifying subjectivity and complement clause objects allowing for further elaboration, is more likely to attract verbs that expresstentativeness and possibility.

To validate our hypothesis and further delineate the functions of each reporting pattern, the following discussion wil primarily revolve around the examination of the semantic features of high-frequency verbs attracted by each reporting pattern.

# 4.2. Evaluative expression: what kind of verbs each pattern favor

An important way writers show their epistemic stance on propositions is through the control verbs in reporting patterns. An analysis of the attraction of verbs to each pattern reveals that pattern (i) (Sayer $+ \lor +$ reported clause) and pattern (ii) (Sayer $+ \lor +$ NP) each used 34 different verbs, pattern (ii) ('Sayer' $+ \lor +$ reported clause) used 30, and pattern (iv) $( \mathrm { T o k e n + V + N P } )$ used 39. Here, we display only the top-six verbs for each pattern. The complete list of verbs and their frequencies across patterns is available in Appendix C.

Fig. 2 shows the frequencies of the top-six vers in each pattern, totaling 207, 162, 727, and 48, respectively. This ranking aligns with the frequency order of all 53 vers across the four patterns discussed in section 4.1, further ilustrating the universality and significance of pattern (iii) with non-human subjects and NP objects in RAs of applied linguistics.

Table 2 presents the percentages of the top six saying verbs in each reporting pattern, accounting for over $5 5 \%$ of total occurrences in their respective pattrns, highlighting their representativeness and indicating verb selection trends. Consequently, the varying degrees of certainty researchers attribute to propositions in each pattern become evident by analyzing the top verbs' frequencies.

Firstly, tentative verbs like ARGUE, REPORT, NOTE, and SUGGEST dominate pattern (i), comprising $4 4 \%$ of its total verb usage. This pattern, featuring human subjects and clause object, invites verbs indicating tentativeness fostering a space for debate and proposition evaluation. Here, writers convey a les certain indication of their interpretations, generally framing them as arguments, reports, suggestions, claims, or indications, thus encouraging reader engagement and critique.10

Secondly, pattern (iv) contrasts with pattern (i) by predominantly using more assured verbs like SHOw, REVEAL, DEMONsTRATE, and HIGHLIGHT, with tentative verbs constituting only $1 7 \%$ of its usage. This pattern has non-human subjects and NP objects, so favoring verbs of certainty. This choice reflects writers more assured indication of statements truth value, typically by marking them as a revelation, demonstration, or hghlight, therey restricting discursive space This oseration supports the hypotheis from section 4.1, suggesting that the degree of certainty or authoria commitment expressed by subjects and objects within pattrns shapes the selection of verbs that enter those patterns.

Thirdly, in pattern (ii), factive vers such as SHOW, REVEAL, DEMONSTRATE, and ILLUSTRATE dominate, forming about $4 5 \%$ of its verbs, with tentative verbs (SUGGEST and INDICATE) at approximately $4 2 \%$ . Due to space constraints, Table 2 limits to the top six verbs per pattern. However,a further examination of the data in Appendix  shows that factive verbs (MEAN (16), CONFIR (15), and EXPLAIN (10) also dominate the next thre spots. This indicates that seven of the top ten verbs in patter (ii) expresing certainty, totaling just over half $( 5 0 . 1 \% )$ of the pattern's total, exceeding those indicating uncertainty $( 4 2 . 8 \% )$ . Consequently, pattern (iii), with its non-human subjects, favors more assured verbs, indicating a credible source of propositions and emphasizing the definitenessof the clause's content.

Fourthly, pattern (ii) lacks a clear verb tendency, with top-six verbs ranging from certainty (SHOw, DEMONsTRATE) $( 2 5 \% )$ to uncertainty (REPORT, PROPOSE) (16.79) and neutrality (DISCUSS, EXPRESS) $( 1 6 . 0 7 \% )$ . The reason for this is unclear, although it might be due to the clash of epistemic stances between its human subjects and NP objects.

The factors influencing verb choice in reporting pattrns willbe discussed from two perspectives. Firstly, when subjects are the same, paters (ii) and (iv) ferig non-an subjets, tend o aract factive vers, regadesof whther the objec i a lause or an NP. Thefore, we can infer that with non-human subjects it isprimarily the subject rather than the object lause or NP) that affects the epistemic status of the verbs entering the reportig pattern. However, when comparing pattrns i) and (ii) (both having human subjects), pattern (i) with a clause as the object tends to attract vers expresing uncertainty, whereas pattern (i) with an NP as the object shows no clear tendency. This indicates that with human subjects having a clause as the object somewhat inluences the factual status of the verbs use in such a pattern. In this case, the combination of a human subject and a clause object works together to ttract uncertain verbs, thereby communicating a proposition with les certainty. This observation aligns with Hyland's (1998b, 2000) studies, which suggest that using hedging verbs with personal subjects renders the statements reliant on individual evaluations, positioning them as alternative opinions rather than definitive ones with scientifi accreditation. Hunston (2013) further supports this view, noting that propositions evaluated as \*what is thought' are more frequently associated with the choice of human subjects and projected clauses as objects.

Secondly, when comparing patterns with identicl objects, patterns (i) and (ii with lause objects diverge in verb preferences: pattern (i) with human subjects tends toward indeterminacy verbs, whereas pattern (ii), with non-human subjects, attracts de terminacy verbs, demonstrating that the subject's nature significantly impacts the epistemic stance of verbs in reporting patterns. Similarly, comparing aterns (ii and (iv), both with NP objects, yies the same conclusion. his again underscores the decisive rol f the subject in verb choice. Hyland (2000) observes that \*writers display a preference for boosters in impersonal framings" (p. 94), a practice that aligns with the scholarly emphasis on objectivity. Hunston (2013) extends this observation, noting a correlation between the use of non-human subjects and NP objects with propositios framed as "what is known", llustrting strategic subject and object selection project specific authorial stances.

Acknowledging that self-sourced and other-sourced reporting might influence the prevalence of certain verbs in reporting patterns research shows diffrent trends for each, with specific subjects and verbs preferred (Charles 2006b; Groom, 2000 Hunston, 1993; Parkinson, 2013b). Whil this doesn't necessarily alter the currently understood epistemic status of verbs typicall attracted by each pattern, this paper, focusing on syntactic considerations, leaves further exploration of this impact to future studies.

The conclusion from the above discussion is as follows. irstly, pattern (i) primaril attracts verbs conveying uncertainty, making claims appear dependent on the researcher's judgment and leaving agreement open to readers' own interpretations. Conversely, patterns (ii) and (iv) tend to atract more factive vers to establish a reliable proposition status, presenting it as consensually given. Pattern (ii, however, ds not exhit a fixed tendncy. econdly, theeistemic status of vers in a patten is largly detmined by the subject, with animate subects atracting les asured verbs and inanimate subjects more defintive ones. Another point to note is that the epistemic meaning conveyed by clauses is determined by the subject, conveying tentativeness with human subjects (patern (i) and certinty with non-human subject (paten (ii). This is mainl ecause objective provenanc for information inanimate ntities) often co-occurs with factive verbs, making it more likely to project obective propositions, and vice versa. This complex interplay affirms that a pattern's meaning stems from a concerted selection of linguistic elements, illusrating the multifaceted nature of conveying stance in RAs.

# 5. Conclusions

In this study, we examined the use of four reporting patterns in a self-compiled corpus of English applied linguistics RAs. The aim is to identify the function of each pattern and how writers prioritize certain patterns over others. The evaluative functions of these patterns are considered a co-selection of the subject, verb, and object.

# 5.1. Main findings

First, our study reveals distinct distribution trends for the four reporting pattrns in the RAs, serving different functions. Pattern (ii), with non-human subjects and clause objet, is the most common, fllowed by paten (iv), featring non-hman subjects and NP objects. Conversely, pattern (ii) with human subjects and NP objects, is least favored. These findings highlight a tendency among writers for non-human subjects to prioritize the objectivity of the source of the propositio, and for using proected clauses as objects, portraying propositions as statements open for further explanation and evaluation. ddtionall, the prevalece of pattern (iv) suggests that using NPs as objects is also a common approach for presenting propositions in RAs.

Second, regarding the semantic functions of reporting patterns, our results indicate that the source of the proposition (the subject)

primarily determines the conveyed epistemic stance. Pattern (i) with animate subjects typicallyattracts hedging verbs, signaling the writer's uncertainty about the proposition's factual status. Converely, patterns (i) and (iv) with inanimate subjects tend to atract factive verbs, reflecting the writer's higher confidence in the proposition's truth conditions. Pattern (ii) shows no consistent trend Additionall, this study finds that the epistemic meaning conveyed by that or wh-clauses depends on the subject conveying certainty with non-human subjects and tentativeness with human subjects.

This study's findings enrich the knowledge of rhetorical functions of reporting pattrns of saying verbs in academic writing. Theoreticall, it expands research into their roles in both verbal and relational processes. Practically, a pattern-based perspective provides more comprehensive input and support to the concept of grammatical consciousnes-raising" (Hunston & Francis, 2000, p. 262).

# 5.2. Implications of reporting in EAP teaching

The research results have significant pedagogical implications for EAP teaching. Analyzing the distribution and function of the four reporting patterns equips educators withesential linguistic tols. Furthermore, examining the preferred verb usage across ifferent reporting patterns can inform targeted instruction on saying verbs. Mastery of these patterns can grealy improve students RA writing skill in applied linguistics facilitating the precise expression of complex ideas with saying verbs. This underscores the necessity for explicit teacher instruction.

We recommend classroom activities to immerse students in the intricacies of reporting structures. Starting with establishing an understanding of academic writing's context, teachers can spark discussions around who writes whose work it i based on, for whom, its purpose, and the language resources used. Such dialogues aim to heighten students awarenessof academic writig's multifaceted nature and its rhetorical considerations, setting the stage for further analytical engagement.

Following this teachers can use consciousnes-raising tass with rel texts to demystify and highlight reporting patterns meanings and functions. Analyzing exemplar texts from RAs in applied linguisics helps students understand how expert writers use language (e. 8., reporting expressions) to achieve their purposes.

Next, teachers design language-focused tasks highlighting these important yet challenging features, giving students RA excerpts in the discipline with various saying verbs and structure. Students identify reporting patterns, experiment withaltering verb choices to adjust argument stregth ., from suget to demonstrate), and compare factive and non-factie saying vers effects on information credibility. A joint discussion follows on how these choices afect the information's certaint. These exercises help students grasp the function of different reporting patterns and the influence of verb choice on argument strength. Teachers can facilitate exercises like creating a 'verb bank' through brainstorming sessions and reflective writing assignments to deepen students' engagement with reporting forms and functions.

Lastly, encouraging students to independently weave learned reporting paterns into their writing and conduct eer reviews foster. practical appication and critical assessment skill. Timely, constructive teacher feedback is essential in guiding this process and navigating the intricacies of academic reporting.

Overall, these pedagogical activities aim to equip students with eential skill for effctive academic writing, emphasizing the strategic use of saying verbs and reporting paterns to enhance carity, appropriatenes, and persuasiveness in their academic endeavors.

# 5.3. Limitations

Although this study has provided insights into academic writing in applied linguistics RAs, it does not provide a full picture of the usage of the four reporting patterns in academic writing. More detailed results could be obtained through further comparative analyses. Therefore, replications of this study are needed, involving iferent sources f reporting (self-sourced and other-sourced), sub geres of RAs, proficiency levels, 1 backgrounds, and discilines. Aditionally, manual odings limitations, due to its timeintensive nature, restricted our corpus size, limiting detailed analysis of les common phenomena like the non-fixed trends in patten (ii. Therefore, future studies would benefit from larer corpora to increase result repreentativenes and allow deeer exploration of these phenomena.
