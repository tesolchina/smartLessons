English for academic purposes

Reading-into-writing tasks are frequently used as an assessment tool in the higher education context. Due to the nature of the task, students strategically process the source texts to successfully select the relevant information and integrate it into their writing. This study addresses the questions of a) how students strategically process the source text in reading-into-writing tasks and b) if there are differences between summary and argumentative tasks with different topics (natural and social sciences) regarding students' strategic processing of the source text. For this purpose, four types of reading-into-writing tasks were developed and completed by 14 students from German universities. While completing the tasks, each participant was asked to verbalize their thoughts (think-aloud), and their screen was video recorded. The audio-visual data were transcribed and analysed using a deductive approach. Our results support previous research about discourse synthesis and metacognitive strategies in reading-into-writing tasks and indicate some differences between the types of tasks and topics in the employment of particular strategies. Moreover, our analyses show that higher-level and lower-level reading processes play a role in the source text strategic processing depending on the reader's goals. This study gives further insights into the reading-into-writing construct, considering task type and topic effects.

# 1. Introduction

Strategies such as skimming/scanning, note-taking, or highlighting are commonly taught i books, courses, and workshops about reading and writing strategies. These resources are considered helpful for improving reading and/or writing, particularly in the higher education context, whee reding and writing skils are neessry for aadeic ucces. However, the main fous often lies in teaching various reading and writing strategies, paying les atention to when and how those strategies should be employed to addressdifferent task demands.

When completing reading-into-writing tasks, students use diffrent strategies that help them understand and select source text content to integrate i into their writing (M. Cho & Lee, 2016; Payant et al, 2019; H-C. Yang & Plakans, 2012). Most research about strategy use in integrated writing has focused on identifying relevant strategies and investigating how these impact student performance (Plakans, 2009a; 2009b). However, littl is known about the diferences in strategic procesing according to task demands. Since stratgies are goal-riented, it is neessary to understand how students mploy differen strategies when facing different types of reading-into-writing tasks. Understanding the processes taking place while students complete a task contributes to a better definition of the construct. Thi is particularly relevant for reading-into-writing in the AP context, since most research in this regard has focused on the L1 context, and ittlei known about the nuances between genres, particularly in L2 and non-English dominant contexts Dalla Costa, 2021; Hirvela & Belcher, 2021).

Therefore, this study investigates strategic procesing in different reading-into-writing tasks to get insights about the differences between genres and task characteristics. This research is important to inform appropriate assessment of the construct, as wel as the effective teaching and learning of EAP students competences. Specificall, we are interested in investigating how university students in Germany strategically proces source texts in different reading-into-writing tasks completed on an online environment. Thus, the questions that guide this study are.

(1) How do universt students strategically process the source text in reading-into-writing tasks with a view to the reading pro cesses and strategies used while completing the task?   
(2) Are there differences in how students strategically process the source text according to particular task demands and characteristics? a. Does the type of task (summary or argumentative integrated writing) elicit different trategic procesing of the source text? b. Does the topic of the source text (natural or social sciences) elicit different trategic processing of the source text?

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Reading-into-writing tasks

Academic writing requires a broad range of competences since it usually includes the processing of multipl sources and pre supposes a combination of receptive (reading) and productive (writing) skill (Chan, 2013). Reading-ino-writing tass have gained popularit for asssing the combination of these sills especially within the English for academic purposes (EAP) context as they are considered the most authentic format that simulates academic tasks (Hirvela, 2016; Weigle, 2004). While the general principle of reading-into-writing tass is that the writers extract and synthesize content from a source text into their own written product, the task can vary depending on its characterisics and requirements. The two most common reading-into-writing tasks are source text summarization (Yu, 2008) and source text support for persuasive/argumentative writing (Gebril, 2010; Plakans, 2009a, 2009b).

Summary writig is considered an essential component in diffrent academic forms, such as writig an abstract, writing a literature review, or synthesizing a lecture or presentation (Denardi et al. 2009). It is based on the ability to select and synthesize the most relevant information and present it comprehensibly in one's own words. Moreover, Hirvela (2016) stated that \*summarie are an ideal place for examining the relationship between EAP and reading-ino-writing (p. 130), since it is the basic type of academic genre that provides insights into the processes and competences of students when reading a text and writing based on that reading.

Argumentativeintegrated writing tass prompt students to take a stance,assume a position, and express their point of view while using relevant source text information to support their argumentation (Gebril, 2010; Plakans, 2009a). This form of reading-into-writig requires students toconsider and contrast ifferent perspectives on a topic whilealuating their opinions i light of the new information obtained from source text reading. Hence it is a type of integrated writing thatallows a deeper analys of the integration of information from the source text with students' own ideas (Guo, 2011).

# 2.2. Strategic processing in reading-into-writing tasks

Both summary and argumentative integrated writing tass entail a receptive proces where students are mainly focused on reading and understanding source text content, followed by a reproductive and productive process in which they select and coherently synthesize the sources (Afflerbach & Cho, 209; Knoch & Sitaalabhorn, 2013; Payant et al., 2019). Due to this dynamic nature of reading-into-writing tasks, students apply different goal-riented strategies to coordinate the sils and actions needed to face the task demands; this proess s clle tratgic procesing (B. ho e l., 2018. hree tye f knowlege f stratc processing have been related to task performance (Dinsmore, 2017): declarative, referring to knowledge about the variety of the strategies; procedural, consisting of knowing how to use these stratgies; and conditional, which refers to knowing when and where to use particular strates. Moreover, there are two dimensions of strategy use that should be considered: quantity concerning strategies' availability and di. versity, and quality, which refers to eficient and adaptive use of trategies (Rogiers et al., 2020). Up to now, research on strategic processing has mainly been focused on the quantity measurement $( 9 4 \% )$ of strategy use and less focused on its quality $( 4 3 \% )$ (Dinsmore, 2017).

This is also true for the context of reading-into-writing research, as most research has been centered on identifing the diversity of the strategies and has been les focused on their adaptivity. Asa result, even with some variations in the studies, a consensus has been reached about the strategies that are elicited in reading-into-writing tasks (Anmarkrud et al., 2014; Plakans, 2009b; Plakans et al., 2019; H-C. Yang & Plakans, 2012). Mainly, the strategies used in reading-into-writing tasks can be categorized into two broad categories. Firstly, discourse synthesis strategies are used to select (e.g., search for important information from the source text), to organize (e.g., identify text structure) and to connect (e.g., use background knowledge) source text content. Secondy, metacognitive strategies are employed in monitoring and evaluating processes, such as detecting comprehension problems, monitoring one's own processes and strategies, or adapting strategies to reading goals.

Research has shown that i reading-into-writing tass, EFL students frequently use reading-related strategies during the entirety of task completion, and that most reading comprehension strategies are used during the pre-writing phase (Barkaoui, 2015; Plakans 2009b). Since comprehension constitutes the basis of reading-into-writing tasks, questions arise about the extent to which L2 writers performance is affected by their source text comprehension abilities and strategies.

In this regard, Plakans' (2008) studies revealed that higher-proficiency writers tend to interact more with the source text and use more global reading strategies (e.g., skimming) and discourse synthesis strategies (Plakans, 2009a). In contrast, lower-proficiency writers tend to employ more local reading strategies, such as focusing on word-level comprehension. In addition, H-C. Yang and Plakans (2012) concluded that dscourse synthes strategies positively ffect students overall writing ability, reducing direct copying from source text. Thus, research has shown that source text processing is a crucial part of reading-into-writing tasks; how students interact with the source text during the whole processcould impact their writing performance (Plakans & Gebril, 2012). However, little is known about how students trateically proces source texts in different tyes of reading-into-writing tasks, which could give us insights into the students ability to adapt their processes and strategies to meet specific task demands, such as summary or argumentative writing.

# 2.3. Strategic processing: summary vs. argumentative tasks

Building on Asencion's (2004, 2008) studies, summary and argumentative writing tasks manifest two dimensions of the reading-into-writing construct as they etail different cognitive processig. This notion aligns with the assumption that different task demands elicit different sourcetext reading processes and strategies. Asencion (2004, 2008)argued that the difference between the tasks ies in cognitive complexity and that reading skill do not influence performance in either type of task. In contrst, further research has found that summary writing is more dificult for students than it task dimensions may sugest (Hirvela, 2016), mainly because it might hold even stronger ties to reading comprehension and skill than argumentative writing (Baba, 2009; M. Cho & Lee, 2016; Gebril & Plakans, 2009).

As a starting point to understanding these contradictory results, Khalifa and Weir' (2009) work on cognitive validity in language testing proposes a model that differentiates types of reading proceses connected to different reading goal. They based their model on the concepts of lower-level and higher-level processes that emerged from the research field of reading comprehension and concern different information processing levels. Lower-lel processes refer to a word/sentence level of recognition (local), while higher-level processes denote a collctive understanding of the text as a whole by linking and combining information (global) (Nasaji, 2014; Weir & Khalifa, 2008).

Based on this, Weir and Khalifa (2008) proposed in their model four types of reading processes, which vary in their level of in. formation procesing (local or global) and according to the reader's goals (careful or expeditios). On one side, at the local lel carfl reading is used when the reader's goal is to atentively read a word or a sentence to understand its meaning, while expedtious readng is used when the reader wants to scan the text looking for details or precise information at one specific locale in the text. On the other side, at the global level, careful reding aims at an overall comprehension of the whole text and its main ideas by reading it with a high level of attention, while expditios reding ams at selective, quick, and eficient text processing to ces desired information on the surface of the text, for example by skimming to get the gist of the text.

Hence, the contradictory results about the role of reading skill and comprehension in the different types of reading-into-writing tasks could be seen as a lack of understanding of the diffrent reading proceses at the local and global levels that are occurring and varying according to reader goals. For example, i this regard, previous studies revealed that independent reading tests tend to target lower-level reading proceses, such as careful local reding, rather than careful global reding, and raely taget the expedtious forms of reading (Urquhart & Weir, 2014). On the other hand, Khalifa and Weir (2009) argued that higher-level reading processes and particularly expeditious reading play an essential role in reading-into-writing tasks, as students focus on selecting source text infor. mation based on explicit task requirements. However, few studies have examined which reading processes are employed in different kinds of integrated academic tasks.

Another aspect that has been discussed in reading-into-writing research is the effect of task topics on student performance. Experimental and intervention studies have investigated prior topic knowledge and topic ffect on it For example, thereis evidence that topic can affect writing performance in an integrated writing test when controlling for English proficiency (Lee & Anderon, 2007), and that familiar topic could facilitate reading comprehension and summary writing performance (W. Yang & Kim, 2020). These findings have been explained by the influence of prior topic knowledge on text comprehension. However, there i lessevidence regarding how task topics may influence students' source text strategic processing in reading-into-writing tasks (Braten & Samuel. stuen, 2004). Therefore, to bettr understand the role of reading processes and strategies in academic reading-into-writing tasks, it is important to explore how the source tex i being processed and investgate whether different strategies are used in different types of tasks with varying topics.

# 3. Methods

We conducted a qualitative study with university students in Germany, who were video-recorded while completing a reading-into writing task in English. A qualitative approach was used to analyze the collcted audio-visual data in depth. Initiall, toidentify strategies used during the reading-into-writing task completion, and how and when particular strategies were used, we coded the audio-visual data using a deductive approach based on the iterature reviewed above. This alowed us to identify previously reported processes and strategies in reading-into-writing tasks. Then, using an inductive approach, we developed further codes that emerged from our data. Finally, to explore the differences between the tasks, we compared the code frequencie for each strategy, considering the number of participants who used each strategy and the number of coded instances.

# 3.1. Instruments

# 3.1.1. Reading-into-writing tasks

Four reading-into-writing tasks were developed using academic texts from introductory textbooks as source texts. Two tasks required students to write a summary, and the other two asked students to write astatement (argumentative writing). Each type of task also varied in the topic, coming from either the field of natural sciences or from social sciences. Instructions for each of the tasks are shown in Table 1.

The tass were piloted with 50 students, who reported being satisfied with the clarity of the instructions, text length, and time provided to complete their respective task. Additionall, the tass were reviewed by four experts: three universit-lel EAP teachers, and one academic English researcher.

Each source text was approximately 1o00 words long, and the students had $6 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ to complete the task. In the four tasks, participants were instructed to select relevant information from the source text, to use thir own words, and not to copy passages from the text. They were told that the expected length of the written product was between 300 and 350 word. The tasks were implemented using an online platorm that alowed participants to track the time, highlight source text passages or key words, and make annotations. An example of the online environment is shown in Fig. 1.

# 3.1.2. Think-aloud protocols $( T A P s )$

TAPs were chosen as a method of data collection in our study because previous research has shown this method to be useful for investigating reading-into-writing strategic processing (Plakans, 2008, 2009b; Plakans et al., 2019; Plakans & Gebril, 2012). The TAPs were conducted remotely, using a video conference platform that allowed the recording participant' screns while they completing the tasks (Zoom Video Communications Inc., 2020). To ensure the validity of the method, recommendations by Barkaoui (2011) and Ericsson and Simon (1998) were fllowed: first, some background information about the TAP was given; then, participants could practice thinking aloud and ask questions regarding the procedure. Ultimately, each participant completed one of the four reading-into-writing tasks that were randomly assigned.

# 3.2. Participants

Participants in this study were 14 students (eight women, six men), between 21 and 32 years old, enrolled in study programs at German universities with English or English/German as the language of instruction, in which the language of instruction requires a minimum of B2 English level. In addition, most of the participants $[ \boldsymbol { \mathbf { n } } = 1 3$ ) had attended a major in English (Leistungskurs) during high school or completed the higher education qualification in Germany (Abitur), in which source-based tasks are used to asses English competences. The other participant (P003) reported taking the Cambridge English qualification with C1 results. Therefore, we could assume that the proficiency level of the participants ranged between B2 and C1, and they were allfamiliar with reading-into-writing tasks. Table 2 provides more information about participants first languages and study programs, as well a the distribution of th four types of reading-into-writing tasks.

# 3.3. Data collection and analysis

TAP data were collected online during the summer semester of 2020. Students were invited via email, which contained information about the study, a consent form, and a video conference link. The collected audio-visual data (voice and screen sharing recordings) were transcribed using an online automatic transcription software (Otter.ai, 2020). A student asstant reviewed and edited the transcriptions, including the transcription of behavioral data from the video recordings of participants' screens (e.g., highlighting note-taking), using the HIAT conventions (Rehbein et al., 2004). For a sample of a transcription, see Appendix A. IDs were used to guarantee participant confidentiality and anonymity. The transcriptions were coded with MAxQDA 2020 (VERBI Software, 2020) using a coding scheme (See Appendix B) based on previous research about reading processes (Weir & Khalifa, 2008) and reading-into-writing strategies (Plakans, 2009b; Plakans e al., 2019). The 14 TAPs were randomly asigned to two coders, who coded half f the data independentl using the coding scheme. In addition, a subset of four TAPs (one per type of task) was also double-coded to check for inter-coder reliability. Cohen's Kappa cofficient was calculated, showing a strong agreement in their coding decisions $( \kappa$ $= 0 . 8 2 \mathrm { \AA }$

# 4. Results and discussion

4.1. RQ1: How do university students strategically process source texts in reading-into-writing tasks?

# 4.1.1. Reading processing

Based on the model proposed by Weir and Khalifa (2008), we found that different reading processing strategie are used depending on the reading phase first reading s. re-reading), and deending onthe writing phase (before writings. while writing). Table 3 shows an overview of the number of participants that used different reading processing strategies during the diffrent phases.

First reading. Our analysis showed that all participants used higher-lel reading processing strategies while reading the source text for the first time (careful global and expeditious global). Furthermore, threestudents (P001, P003, P010) combined careful and expe ditious reading processes. The careful global reading processing during the first reading was reflected in an attentie reading of the source text to get an overall understanding; that is, mainly a non-stop reading of the whole or large part of the source text without much interaction. On the other side, expedtious global reading was evident when participants were reading while focusing their attention to extract and select relevant content from the source text, already interacting with it, for example, when participants were identifying key ideas, highlighting, or taking notes, as shown in the following TAPs extract:

"[reading: The total length of the Dutch coastline is more than 400 km]. I am gonna highlight that [highlights: "400 km"]. [reading Which ca e ividd nt thre diffeent parts higlights: "the dent parts"]. [reing The td nets andstuaries inthe South, now mostl controlled by open or closed barriers the unintrupted, duned Holland coast and the Wadden Sea are featring  serie of barrier islands in the north. At present, [highlights: amost one third of the country is located below average sea level]] That's an interesting fact." (P022, first reading: expeditious global)

On the other hand, only one participant (P015) also used a lower-level reading processing strategy during the first reading phase. pecifically, the student aplied a careful local reding approach to antivel fus on understanding the source text at th word level. ts is exemplified in the following segment:

"[reading: this los of a person's irs languag is known as 1 atrition]. I lok up this word. [using dictionary: atrition] Zermirbung Abnutzung Verschle. Okay yeah Verschle. So, losing it in during the time. So more time proceeds then language gets worst" (P015, first reading: careful local)

Re-reading Regarding the source text re-reading phase, our dat showed that al participants used expeditious global reding process and that the purpose f using it varied according to the writing phase. The TAPs evidenced that when students used this reading process before writing, it was employed with the same purpose as during the first reading phase, usuall to select relevant information using highlighting or note-taking. While when they employed it while writing, it was used to check missing relevant source text information for their own texts, as presented in the following extracts.

Before "et's   e fir f ake irt s t of t     s t .. writing it's prety ong ky, o ew  el i ry m hing hghs eo age  lel" he i cme to meg dthen ehthenlso climte chge hligs ie chnge"]. Is   se,   i's n mre rent (7 g xios goal)   
While "Yeh. Uh. h nd I'm I' us thinking o  ontiue y tex. hm. A Lik lik tisi releant ring e tions rationl? When emotions writing are not uder onl, thi etion makes no more sese thn sking whther the ke-ek ee is .] Maybe n o rant" (2, re-readng expeditious global)

During the re-reading phase, most participants also used lower-level processes (careful local and expeditios local reading).Careful local reading was mainly used before students started to write, in order to understand a sentence or word that was unclear after reading it for the irst time. Expditious ocal, employed by the majority of the participants during the writing process, was used to search or scan the source text for specific information to use in their texts (e.g., names, word spelling). Examples can be observed in the following TAPs excerpts:

"I should rd it again because I didnt gt everything. reading: In psycholinguistic studies of ilinguals itis common for rerchers to rely on particiants self-reort ratings of ther own level of roficiency when s- speaking, reding and listening in thir languages] okay" (P015, re-reading: careful local)

"Ehm yeah. I'm just looing for the word envionment ust to check if it's eh written correct (chuckle) ehm.  gues it was here n the text .. ehm hmhm ... come on .. da... [reading: en viron mental. Yeah, okay" (P018, re-reading: expeditious local)

In summary, regarding the different levels of information procesing, our findings show that higher-level reading strategies played an important role for all participants. Specificall, careful global reading was relevant during the firstreading phase of the source text, while expeditious global reading was used during whole task completion. These results are coherent with the notion proposed by Khalifa and Weir (2009) that reading-into-writing tasks mainly evoke higher-evel reading proceses, particularly expeditious reading, as it is the strategy students use to identify and select relevant information in the source text. However, contrary to what Khalifa and Wer (2009) suggested about lower-level reading proceses being lessrelevant in reading-into-writing tass as compared to independent tasks, our results suggest that careul local and expeditious oal reading also play a role in all reading-into-writing tas, in particular when taking into account the processing phase (first reading, r-reading, before or while writing). This ligns with our assumption that reading processing strategies are used to accomplish particular reader goals. Specificall, higher-level reading processes are used to understand the source text and its main ides at aglobal level, while lower-level reading proceses are used to decode information at the local level, such as scanning source text for specific details when writing one's own text.

# 4.1.2. Source text processing strategies

Our TAPs showed that participants used diferent types of strategies related to discourse synthesis processes and metacognitive strategies. Table 4 shows the different strategies found in our data and how frequently they were used.

Discourse synthesis strategies. We found a variety of strategies used by the students to select, organize and connect source text ontent. Furthermore, all of these strategies were mainly used before the writing phase.

Most participants used strategies such as identifying key ideas, summarizing/paraphrasing source text ideas, recognizing source text structure/rhetorical cues, highlightig, and note-taking. These strategies were mainly used to asss, select and organize relevant content from the source text. Moreover, on some occasions, there was an overlap between these strategies. Particularly, TAPs showed that students rcognize source text structure/rhetorical cues that helped them identif key ideas. Then, they used highlighting to mark these ideas, or summarization/paraphrasing and note-taking to organize them. Some examples can be seen in the following TAPs excerpts:

"I think i's pretty necesary to mention this geographer John Agnew because the aspects he mentioned, they were pretty welldetailed, explained" (Po04, identifying key ideas, recognizing text structure/rhetorical cues)

"Okay, so below sea level ispretty important thing highlights: below average sea level] when it comes to meaning and then ehmthen also climate change [highlights: climate change] It's aways been an issue, but I gues it's becoming more releant" (P007, ientifying key ideas, highlighting)

"Well I think I can note at this point that um . that note-taking: is known that learning an L2 can lead to the decline of L1]" (P015, summarizing/paraphrasing source text ideas, note-taking)

Regarding giving their own opinion, drawing on background knowledge, and making inferences, our data showed that the majority of participants mainly used these strategies to connect source text content with the students own perspectives (eg, interest, agrement, prior knowledge), as exemplified in the following excerpts:

"I kind of totally agree with those two" (Po09, giving own opinion)

"Just last week I heard something about humans being complex emotional beings. That fits in wel (Po02, drawing on background knowledge)

"Yeah. That's like the siser of my grandma who live in America and some- eh somehow losing her German (chuckles) slowly" (P015, drawing on background knowledge)

"I guess to protect the areas which seem to be of high environmental relevance" (P007, making inferences)

On the other hand, trategies such as asking questions and using a dictionary were les often used by our participant, and they were mainly used to get a beter understanding of ource text content t local level (e.g., concepts, vocabulary), as shown in the following

TAPs extracts:

"I wonder if the Delta project like if this is still called the Delta?" (Po07, asking questions)

"Performance in L2 was better, yeah, but in which group?" (P015, asking questions)

"I think I just look up the word proficiency because I'm not quite sure what it means [using dictionary: proficiency]. Prof ficien cy, Fertigkeit, Befahigung, Leistung. Okay, yeah" (P015, using dictionary)

Metacognitive strategis. The strategy of monitoring own processing was the strategy most often used and it was mostly employed before writing, where it was mainly used to monitor and plan one's own processes and strategies (e.g., accommodating strategies according t reading goals). On the other side, when it was used while writing, it was mainly use to monitor if source tex information was correctly included (e.g., checking if relevant content from the source text was included). Moreover, monitoring one's own processing before writing showed some overlaps with rcognizing lack of comprehension. This overlap was shown when students recognized their lack of understanding and adapted their strategies and processes according to it. Similarly, while writing there was some overlap between checking appropriate citation/avoiding copying, which was the only strategy used more frequently while writing than before writing. This was evidenced by how, during the writing process some students monitored and evaluated whether they missed relevant source text information, as they avoided direct copying. These results can be observed in the following examples.

Finally, checking task instruction to integrate source text was mainly used before writing. When using this srategy, students re-read he task instruction to check if they were going in the right direction, as shown in the following TAPs excerpts:

"What was the task? Eh argue whether or not emotions can make us think rationally. Emotions make us think rationally. Okay" (P009, checking task instruction)

Fig. 2. Number of participants per task using diffrent reading strategies during the first reading and re-reading of the source text

In summary our TAPs showed that strategic source text processing mainly occurred before students started writing. These results are consistent with previous studies from Barkaoui (2015) and Plakans (2009b), who found that most source tex interaction happened before the writing process which indicates that students tend to focus on understanding thesource text and selecting relevant content from it before writing their texts. Furthermore, it was confirmed that our students used a variety of previously reported strategies in reading-into-writing tasks (Plakans, 2008, 2009b; Plakans et al., 2019; Plakans & Gebril, 2012). In particular, our results support the relevance of discourse synthesis processes in integrated writing to select, organize, and connect source text content (Spivey & King, 1989). Likewise, our data indicate that students use metacognitive strategies to monitor and evaluate their processes and strategies during the reading-into-writing tass (Chou, 2013; Plakans, 2009b; Plakans et al., 2019). These results also support the transfer of previously reported processes and strategies into a computer-based environment (Zacharias, 2021).

4.2. RQ2: Are there differences on how students strategically process the source text according to particular task demands and characteristics?

# 4.2.1. Type of task

Reading processing strategies. Our TAPs evidenced that the diffrences between the type of task (summary and argumentative) regarding the use of reading processing strategies varied according to the reading phase first rading vs. r-reading). The number of participants per task that employed the diffrent reading procesing strategies found in our reading-into-writing tasks is shown in Fig. 2.

In the first reading phase, the majorit of participants in both task types (five participants per type) used careful global reading to get an overall understanding of the source text. Likewise, there was no difference in using the expedtious local reding, which was not used by any participant durig this reading phase. Furthermore, there was a scant difference between the type of tasks regarding expeditious global reading, which was employed by four participants in the summary task while only three used it in the argumentative task. Similarly, only one participant from the summary task used careful local reading.

In the re-reding phase, afer the participants were alredy famiiarized wth the source text, we can se the most triking difference between the summary and argumentative task in careful ocal reding. Seificall, ll summary writing participants (sen students) used this stratey compared to four argumentative writing participant. In addition, there was a minimal dfference in expeditious ocal reading, which was used by one participant more in the summary task (six students) than in the argumentative task (five students). Finally, there were no difference between the type of tass in careul global reading and expetious globalreading used by none and all participants, respectively.

Source text processing strategies. Our TAPs evidenced some diffrences in the use of particular discourse synthesis and metacognitive strategies depending on the type of tak (summary and argumentative). The number of participants and code instances for each strategy according to the type of task and topic is shown in Table 5.

Regarding the discourse synthesis strategies, the strategies used equally by participants in both types of tasks were recognizing ST structure/horical cues and highlightig. ome ther straties, such as identifinky ides and making infences, wre used by the same number of participants in each task, but they varied in the frequency they used them (code instances). Specifiall, summary task participants employed both strategies more frequently. Moreover, we found that summarizing/paraphrasing ST deas, asking questions, using dictionary, and note-taking strategies were not only used by the majorit or ll summary writing participants but were also used more often than by the participants from the argumentativetasks. On the other hand, drawing on background knowledge strategy was used by more participants and more often in the argumentative tasks than by participants in summary tasks. In addition, the giving own opinion strategy had more coded instances in the argumentative tasks, athough it was used by one participant more inthe summary

tasks.

Furthermore, concerning the metacognitive trategies, most strategies were used equally by summary and argumentative writing participants, except for recognizing lack of comprehension, which all participants in the summary tasks used compared to only four participants in the argumentative tasks. An overview of the most striking differences between the different types of tass is shown in Fig. 3.

In sum, our results showed some similarities between the argumentative and summary tasks in the use of particular reading processes and strategies that play a role in both types of tasks (Golpour, 2014). For example, during the reading processing of the source text, careful global reding in the first phase and expedtious global reding in the re-redin were highly present and plaed a role in both typs of tass, which is maily rlat to the naure of the reading-into-writing tasks, which evoke higher-lel reading processes (Weir & Khalifa, 2008). Nevertheless, the analys of strategy use frequencies according to the type of task also supported our assumption that strategic reading processes and the use of particular strategies differ according to students' goals in response to task-specific requirements. irst confirming previous research that proposed that summary writing might hold stronger ties to reading comprehension than argumentative writing (Baba, 2009; M. Cho & Lee, 2016; Gebril & Plakans, 2009), our results showed that careful local reading was particularly relevant for summary writing, as well as strategies such as summarizing/paraphrasing ST ideas, asking questions, using dictionary, not-tking, and recognizing lack of comprehension.These reding processes and stratgies are mainly related to participants' goals of attaining a deeper understanding of the source text, even at the word/sentence level. Second, in the argu. mentative tasks, giving own opinion and drawing on background knowledge were more frequently used than in summary tasks, supporting previous evidence regarding the important role of critical thinking in argumentative tasks (Fahim & Mirzaii, 2014).

# 4.2.2. Topic of source text

# Reading processing strategies

Our data showed that the most obvious dfferences between social and natural ciences topics are evident in the first reading phase Specificall, all seen participants from the ocial sciences tasks used careful global reading, while only thre participants from the natural sciences tass used it. Moreover, six participants working on natural sciece topics used expditious goal reading, compared to only one participant working on a social science topic.

On the other ide, we found similarities in the rding proceses rearding there-reading phase. pecificly, the only difference was found in careful local and expeditious localreading, which were used by six participants in the natural sciences tasks, compared to five participants in the social sciences tasks.

![](img/ecc5c7557498faf872e903d5bd50217e86a616e99329ef24d2e0d76679915641.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Number of coded instances per type of task (number of times the strategy was used).

Source text processing strategies. Our results evidence that topics also influence how often particular discourse synthesis and metacognitive strategies were used. Overall participants working on social sciences topics used most f the strategies more often than participants working on natural sciences topics. The only strategy used more often by participants from natural sciences topics was using dictionary, particularly in the summary task.

Furthermore, our findings show some differences in the use of particular strategies that depend on the combination of task and topic. Specificall, participants working on the natral sciees arumentative task have fewer code instanes than the other tasks, this being the only task in which participants did not use the asking questions srategy. With regard to the natural sciences summary task, participants used the strategies of summarizing/paraphrasing source text ideas, using dictionary, and highlighting more often than participants in the other tasks.

Similarl, participants working on the social sciences argumentative task used giving own opinion and monitoring own processing strategies notably more often than participants working on the other tasks. In addition, participants working on this task were the only ones who did not employ the using dictionary strategy. Concerning the participants from the social sciences summary task, they employed the recognizing lack of comprehension strategy more often and used the highlighting strategy les often than participants from the other tasks.

Overall, our results support the assumption that the topic effct may not only impact performance, but also task processing (Braten et a., 2018). Specificall, we found a higher frequency of word-level understanding strategies with natural sciences topics. Some of these results may be explained because the natural science topics, especially those used in the summary task, had more technical content and vocabulary (i., Netherlands costal zone). This contrasted with the social sciences topics (.., emotions and blingualism), which might contain more familiar content and vocabulary for the students, especially considering that most participants came from a social sciences background. These results are consistent with previous research that evidenced that topic familiarity may have a compensatory function in goal-oriented reading, facilitating reading processing and comprehension (Horiba & Fukaya, 2015; Lee & Anderson, 2007).

# 5. Conclusions and implications

Reading-into-writing tasks as an assessment tool of English for academic purposes have become increasingly relevant, with summary and argumentative writing being the most common types of integrated tasks. This study investigated how source text's strategic processig difer according to task demands and topics. Our findings support previous reearch and give new insights into the differences between different types of reading-into-writing tasks.

First this study shows that previously reported processes and strategies employed in reading-into-writing tasks are transferred into an online environment. pecificall, we found that source text interaction mainly happened before the writing proces, consistent with previous research (Barkaoui, 2015; Plakans, 2009b). Moreover, our observations also show previously reported discourse synthesis and metacognitive strategies students use in reading-into-writing tasks (Chou, 2013; Plakans, 2008, 2009b; Plakans et al., 2019, Plakans & Gebril, 2012). This emphasizes the suitability of computer-based asessment for integrated writing tasks, and supports the inclusion of tols for highlighting and note-taking, as this simulates the tass students face in the academic context (Zacharias, 2021).

Second, the resuts support our assumption that reading proceses and source tex strateges are used to accomplish particular goals in response to specific task requirements and characteristics. In general, our findings evidence that, as suggested by Khalifa and Weir (2009), reading-into-writing tasks primaril eoke higher-lel reading processes. However, diffrent reading processing strategies are used by students throughout the completion of the tass according to pecific reding goals, particularly higher-level reading proceses for a global understanding of the source text and lower-level reading procese to decode information at a ocal level Urquhart & Weir, 2014; Weir & Khalifa, 2008).

Concerning task types and topics, our findings sugest that students process the source texts diffrently depending on genre. expectations and topics. Our analyses confirmed previous research suggesting that summary writing is stronger related to reading comprehension than argumentative writing (Baba, 2009; M. Cho & Lee, 2016; Gebril & Plakans, 2009), while argumentative writing has stronger ties with critical thinking and including own experiences and ideas (Fahim & Miraii, 2014). Specificall, our findings show that students in summary tasks mostly employed reading proceses and strategies such as careful local reading, summa rizng/paraphrasing ST ideas, asking questions, using dictionary, note-taking, and recognizing lack of comprehension, while participants in argumentative tasks used strategies such as, giving own opinion and drawing on background knowledge. These results have implications for reading-into-writing assessment, as they contribute to a better understanding of the construct and the nuances between genres (Plakans & Ohta, 2021). For an appropriateasessment, it i important to develop tas that rflect the asessment purpose and focus on the competences intended to be measured. For example, when developing a summary task, the focus should be on assesing stu. dents abilit to comprehend the source text and synthesize its main ideas. In contrast, in the argumentative task, students critical thinking and integrating source text into their argumentation become more relevant, and these ifferences should also be reflected in the assessment criteria.

Furthermore, our findings suggest that the topic may also have an effect on task processing (Braten et al., 2018). Specifically, we found more frequent use of word-level understanding strategies in less familiar natural sciences tasks, such as using dictionary, compared to more familiar social sciences topics in which students used strategies more often and showed more variability of stra tegies. Considering these results and previous research that evidenced that topic familiarity may have a compensatory function in goal-oriented reading, facilitating reading processng and comprehension (Horiba & Fukaya, 2015; Lee & Anderson, 2007; w. Yang &

Kim, 2020), topic familiarity and students' background should be a factor to be considered when developing reading-into-writing tasks.

Concerning the pedagogical implications, this study can inform teachers and students about the importance of understanding strategic processing in reading-into-writing tasks, as well as genre-expectations and topic efect. Additionall, this study gives us relevant insights about reading-into-writing tass in a context where English is used as language of instruction, in which teachers need to identify students particular resources to promote efective reading processes and strategies for completing complex tass (Panah, 2021). Currently, teachers in L2 and non-majority English contexts face the challenge of not having enough resources in this regard. and they tend to focus on the outcome (e.g., five-paragraph essay structure) and les on the processand students partcular needs (Hrvela & Belcher, 2021). This study adreses these challenges by shedding light on how students stategically process integrated tasks depending on task requirements and source text topics, which leads to a deeper understanding of the adaptabilit and efficiency of particular strategies. In addition, when teachers are aware of successful processes and strategies, they can give fedack that goes beyond the otcome and addresses the efectivenessf stdents procees and strateie, focsing on stdent reource and fostering a better transfer of the skills into academic tasks.

Our study also yielded further questions about how source text's strategic processing should be taught and promoted to support students in the academic context, as well as how using particular strategies could impact students' academic performance. More research should be conducted using other methods, such as questionnaires and log data, which alow for larg-scale data collction and analysis, considering different types of reading-into-writing tasks and students' outcomes.

# 5.1. Limitations

This study has two main limitations that should be considered for further research about strategic processing in reading-intowriting tass. The first limitation is the small sample size, especially as we had four different types of tasks. However, we did in. depth qualitative analyses that revealed several insights about the study's research questions, and in order to make the results comparable between tasks, we aimed at having an equal distribution of the participants between the different tasks (i.e., seven participants in each type of task and seven participants working on each topic). The second limitation is that the think-aloud method we employed might impact the results, as participants diffr in their bility to verbalize their thoughts and how this may afect their processes. Therefore, in this study, we complement the verbal data with video recordings that allowed us to enrich and expand our understanding of the processes taking place while participants were working on the tasks.

P015: Okay, so um I am first gonna just start reading everything. [reading: Task. Uh Read the following text. Summarize what is already known about blingualism and what is unclear. Write about 300 words, use your own words and do not copy passages from the text.] Okay, how many words are 300 words? How am I going to find out how many words thisis?Ehm. [reading: Use your own words and do not copy passages from the text. You have up to $6 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ to complete the task. When a passage word from the reading text is selected, it is automatically highlighted. You may also use the grey space to take notes.] Ah Okay, that's the one in the middle.

P015: Ahm. So, my job is to read the text and summarize what i already known about bilingualism and what is unclear. Okay, so how long is the text? Oh yeah, it's it's quite long. So I have eh $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to complete the whole task. Okay, well that should be fine.

P015: So the text. [reading: Bilingualism and other forms of multilingualism. Despite all the interest and research on the topic of bilingualism, there is no consensus among researchers regarding the definition of bilingualism.] Is-um I do- I'm thinking about if I should just start, yeah well should, Icould take notes. ehm while I'm reading. [reading: Despit all the interest and research of the topic of bilingualism, there is no consensus among researchers regarding the definition]. So [note taking: unclear is the definition of bilingualism.] [reading: And similarly determining who, who is and who is not bilingual is not as straightforward, as one might assume. In psyholinguistis studs f biinguals, itis comon for rehers oely on participants self-rorted ratings of their own level of proficiency when speaking, reading and istening in thir languages.] I should read it again because I didn't get everything. [reading: In psycholinguistic studies of bilinguals it is common for researchers to rely on participants' self-report ratings of their own level of proficiency when s-speaking, reading and listening in their languages] Okay [reading: Although it is possble to assparticipants abilities in their two languages, doing so would be time consuming and costy a the tests are copyrighted products, that must be purchased. In studies with bilinguals, researchers typically report a great deal of demographic information about participants, including the age at which they began learning each language and their formal education in each of their languages. In recent years, several questionnaires have been developed toassessthe language experience in those who know more than one language, such as L E A P Q and language history questions.]

P015: So, I didn't take notes. What was the task again? reading: Read the following text. Summarize what i already known about bilingualism and what is unclear]. So has there ben anything that I missed? [reading: In studies with bilinguals, res-researchers typically required a great deal of demographic information s including the age at which they began learning each language and their formal education in ach of their languages. In recent years several questions have ben developed to ases lnguage experience in those who know more than one language, such as the L E A P Q and language history questions.] No, I think there was nothing concerning the task but I'll see.

P015: [reading: When bilinguals self-rated proficiency] I think I just look up the word proficiency because I'm not quite sure what it means [dictionary: proficiency]. Prof ficien cy, Fertigkeit, Befahigung, Leistung. Okay, yeah, so.. that's good um.
