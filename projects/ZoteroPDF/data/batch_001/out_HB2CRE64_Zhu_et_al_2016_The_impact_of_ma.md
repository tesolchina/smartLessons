# ABSTRACT

Although the profound impact of marketization in academic world has been extensively studied, analytical attention is substantially concentrated on the organizational operation of universities. Less attention has been paid to the impact of marketization on the structure of academic disciplines and the communication of academicians, which is particular true in non-English-speaking countries. Drawing on the theory of genre analysis, this study sets out to investigate how the uptake of market discourse reshapes the structure of one Chinese academic discipline – the Chinese English Language Teaching (ELT) discipline, and how it redefines the pattern of Chinese ELT practitioners’ disciplinary interaction. Textual data examined include textbooks, policy documents, curricula, syllabus, and insiders’ accounts. Analytical results demonstrate that marketization is both a force driving the commercialization of Chinese ELT academic activities and a force facilitating the fragmentation of the formerly monolithic Chinese ELT discipline.

# 1. Introduction

The popularity of corporate instruments and techniques in universities and the shift of university governance from ‘collegial model to institutional managerialism’ (Sporn, 2002) lead to, among others, the marketization of university discourse. Fairclough’s (1993) seminal work defines marketization as ‘the restructuring of the order of discourse on the model of more central market organizations’ (p. 143). This increasingly notable colonization of the language of marketing on the discursive practices of universities has drawn the attention of a number of discourse researchers (Askehave, 2007; Connell & Galasiński, 1998; Han, 2014; Osman, 2008; Xiong, 2012). The analytical focus is largely on the examination of the appropriation of promotional culture in the production of universities’ public texts (i.e. mission statement, prospectus, and job advertisements) and the exploration of the impact of marketization on the organizational operation of universities. These studies demonstrate discourse analysts’ shared interest in the study of universities’ external communication with the public and their agenda of forming a new organizational identity of active market players who reduce higher education services to products that can be readily served to the needs of customers, such as students, industrial clients.

However, the impact of marketization influences not only the organizational operation of universities; more significantly, it has changed the communication style of the very academic disciplines. As illustrated in Fairclough’s (1993, pp. 151–153) succinct analysis of his personal ‘supporting statements’ in applying for an academic promotion, promotional culture is increasingly apparent in the texts generated within the professional community of academicians, including both research and administrative genres. The categorization of academic genres into research and administrative types (Diani, 2014) is a pragmatic choice for the convenience of the present study. Research genres refer to text-types which academicians compose to construct and disseminate disciplinary knowledge, that is, journal articles (Hirano, 2009; Lim, 2012; Samraj, 2005), dissertations/theses (Lim, 2014; Thompson, 2005; Samraj, 2008), and books and textbooks (Moore, 2002; Parodi, 2010). Administrative genres are text-types which are generated mainly to serve the operational need of academic community, for example, editors’ decision letters (Flowerdew & Dudley-Evans, 2002), assessment committee’s tenure and promotion letters (Hyon, 2008), academic introductory genres (Bhatia, 1997), acknowledgements (Hyland, 2003), personal statements (Samraj & Monk, 2008), and authors’ response to peer review (Feak, 2009).

Academic administrative genres are either ‘occluded’ from the public sight for the sake of confidentiality or placed in disregarded positions because of their distant relationship with the presentation of disciplinary knowledge (Hyland, 2003). They are important because they ‘support and validate the manufacture of knowledge’ and bolster ‘the academic administrative process of hiring, promotion and departmental review’ (Swales, 1996, p. 46). These genres are suggestive of many facets of the institutional life of academicians, revealing how academicians of different levels interact and how they position and are positioned in actual interactions. This study follows the literature of academic administrative genre studies and investigates the texture and composition of one Chinese academic introductory genre, that is, English Language Teaching (ELT) textbook prefaces. The general aim is to describe its formal structures and patterns, to explore its dialectic relationship with the culture and norms of Chinese ELT discipline, and finally to map out part of the impact of marketization in (re)shaping the communication and composition of the discipline. The findings may shed some light on the institutional changes that many in the Chinese academic discipline are experiencing currently.

# 2. Chinese ELT discipline as a discourse community

The present research of Chinese ELT discipline is based on the understanding of academic disciplines as a closely knit discourse community. The concept of discourse community is devised mainly by rhetoricians (Bizzell, 1992; Duffy, 2003) and applied linguists (Swales, 1987, 1990) in order to circumscribe their understanding of typified linguistic behaviors. This ‘middle-ranged’ (Bazerman, 2008) concept is among a few scholarly efforts of relating micro language in use to macro social structures in a wide range of communicative situations, for example, speech community, interpretive community, and community of practices. These middle-ranged concepts are better taken as a prototypical theorizing of the socio-pragmatic dimension of non-egalitarian social institutions, but not rigidly demarcated notions consisted of static paradigms (Bizzell, 1992). Their characteristic of prototypicality enables researchers of diverse interests to capture the dynamic and contestation of social structures and processes.

Prototypicality implies that discourse communities have a number of defining features pointing to its identity and integrity, while leaving many things open which need to be negotiated in contextual specificities. The survival of a discourse community, according to Swales (1987), presupposes the commonality of goals, the development of discoursal conventions, a critical mass of members, and a reasonable ration between experts and novices. At the same time, discourse communities differ from each other in terms of personal involvement, the degree of connection, and the level of norm-developed (Swales, 1990, pp. 21–32). The present study is not meant to be an itemized examination of Chinese ELT discipline against each of the defining/negotiable paradigms. Rather, the interpreting focus is selectively on the study of the dimension of norm-development, as its analysis points to the most notable change of the discipline.

The paradigm of norm-development denotes that discourse communities vary according to the degree of standardization and the regulation of community structures and activities. A norm-developed discourse community is characteristic of strict control and regulation of many aspects of community activities, positions and duties, in forms of written or unspoken rules. Since less space of variation exists in the negotiation of positions and the conducting of community activities, members may be more ‘disengaged’ in their duty-like interactions (Swales, 1987, p. 11). Exemplars of norm-developed discourse communities include an interest group, a professional association, a company, a department, or an established academic discipline. Members of norm-developing communities, on the contrary, may have less predictability and more surprising elements in their activities because of the lower degree of standardization of activities (Freed & Broadhead, 1987, p. 155). Members are more likely to engage in personal interactions, as their investment of rhetorical efforts may contribute to the formation of disciplinary norms in line with their own ideologies.

The difference between ‘norm-developed’ and ‘norm-developing’ is important for the present study since Chinese government’s initiatives of marketization is dismantling the highly centralized profile of Chinese ELT discipline and changing it from a ‘norm-developed’ community to a ‘norm-developing’ one. The ‘norm-developed’ community of ELT practitioners before the marketization is of a higher degree of stability and bureaucratization (cf. Xiong, 2012) owing to the government educational authority’s strict control and regulation. Chinese ELT is formerly tied closely to the political interests of the country and has been considered as a major tool of economic development and national modernization (Jin & Cortazzi, 2002). A number of aspects of the discipline have been administered according to concentrated schemes, for example, policy setting, teacher preparation, textbook development, and examination programs (Hu, 2002). Recently, side effects of such rigid regulation are becoming gradually obvious, for example, the instrumentalization of teaching (Fang & Warschauer, 2004), the limited local relevance of invariant national policy (Nunan, 2003), the out-of-date of curriculum (Chang, 2006).

These emerging problems, together with China’s worries about the undermining of Chinese linguistic integrity caused by the overwhelming spread of English (Johnson, 2009), prompt the government to retreat from the formerly centralized ELT policy and to introduce corporate logic to the discipline, most notably in the sector of higher education. Accordingly, marketization is imposing a great impact on the professional and institutional lives of Chinese ELT practitioners and turns the discipline into a ‘norm-developing’ community. On the one hand, a number of professional activities of the discipline are restructured according to the corporate and managerial principles. Adaptation seems necessary for all members to survive the increasingly competitive environments, for example, teachers, textbook writers, publishers, English teaching units, and even the disciplinary as a whole. Early signals of the marketizing initiatives (Cai, 2007) include the removal of regulation demanding undergraduates to pass the national CET (College English Test) examination before graduation, the reduction of mandatory teaching hours of English, the updating of curriculum content, the amplification of elective courses related to English language and culture, and in case of the present research, the commercialization of ELT textbook production.

On the other hand, marketization causes an unavoidable renegotiation of the relations of power within the discipline and urges ELT practitioners to reposition themselves in relation to other members of the discipline. Chinese government loosens the control of the discipline, but it does not relinquish the authority to the free market, waiting for the natural evolving and restructuring of the relations of power within the discipline. It is still a powerful gatekeeper of the changing discipline, because it decides who can enter into and become active participants of the newly formed knowledge market (Zhang, 2008). A number of professors and virtuoso practitioners, as represented by ELT textbook writers, have been selected to form various professional committees as authority-holders of the reforming discipline. Under such circumstances, it is natural for those authorityholders to consolidate their newly-acquired dominant positions within the discipline whose members are too accustomed to its traditional im-personified government administration (Zhang & Luo, 2004). It is in this sense that marketization is both a driving force of commercializing Chinese ELT practitioners’ professional activities, and also a driving force of restructuring the relations of power within the discipline. The present study attempts to explore how the dual effect is discursively realized in the professional genre of ELT textbook prefaces, what challenges and demanding tasks it creates, and how these tasks are rhetorically handled by Chinese ELT practitioners.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Theoretical background

The design of this research draws on the theory of genre analysis (Bazerman, 1988; Bhatia, 1993; Swales, 1990), the studies of academic introductory genres (Bhatia, 1997; Hyland, 2003), and the method of textography (Swales, 1998). Genre theory evolves from researchers’ interests of mapping the academic world. The broad sociological perspective exploring the system of academic world contributes, on the level of social movement and practices, an understanding of the formation and specialism of academic disciplines and an understanding of their inertial conventions and driving innovations (Latour & Woolgar, 1986). In contrast, genre theory takes a particularized perspective and concentrates on the examination of written texts created by academicians to complete professional tasks they recurrently encounter. Academic written texts are important media of diffusing and negotiating disciplinary knowledge. The communal wisdom of disciplines typifies written texts to stabilize the correlation between linguistic constructions and rhetorical situations, paving ways for the construction of complicated disciplinary concepts and the ‘virtuosities of communication’ among experienced disciplinary members (Bazerman, 1988, p. 23). Such nature and function of academic written texts make the analysis of concrete disciplinary text-types and the exploration of embedded professional and institutional cultures a fruitful approach to probe the norms and cultures of academic world. The genre examined in this research is academic introductory genres, which normally accompany academic books like monographs, textbooks, collected papers, dissertations, and theses (Bhatia, 1997).

Introductory genres normally proceed and are conventionally taken as separated from the main content of scholarly argument of academic books (Bhatia, 1997). Most of them are short texts and numbered in Roman numerals. This assumed peripheral position explains the comparatively short literature of the examination of their nature, structure, and communicative functions. Bhatia (1997), however, argues that introductory genres are far from as a straightforward academic genre as they may appear. The authorship of prefaces, forwards, introduction, and book blurbs is a strategic combination of book authors, series editors, celebrity scholars, and the publishers. The assumed singular purpose of introducing academic works is frequently confronted with an increasingly visible mixing of promotional agenda caused by ‘the intense competition in the publishing industry’ (Bhatia, 1997, p. 188). In a similar vein, Hyland (2003) shows that acknowledgements, another conventional introductory genre accompanying dissertations/theses, are not a pure text of expressing indebtedness and appreciation either. The genre supplies a handy opportunity of officially recognizing those who have played a role in the research. Beyond this, it also creates a legitimate space of promoting novice researcher’s credibility and professional identity by implying their engagement with a larger network of scholarly colleagues and their alignment ‘with well-known or influential academics’ (p. 257). The contestation between the assumed singularity and the actual complexity of the nature of introductory genres forms the basis of the present study of mutual constitution of textbook prefaces and the institutional realities of Chinese ELT discipline.

The authors’ processing of genre exemplars adopts both the regular Move (communicative purpose, step, lexico-grammar) analysis (Bhatia, 1993, pp. 22–36; Swales, 1990, 2004) and the innovative research paradigms of textography framed in Swales (1998). Textography is concerned with the acquisition of a rich account of the literate ecology of disciplinary communities through an ethnographic investigation of its members’ writing activities. The joint of study of culture and study of language is realized by an integration of textual analysis with ethnographic methods of interviews, observations, and document analysis. Beyond the visible linguistic criteria like layout, structure, syntax and diction, textographic studies further analyze written texts as media of discursive practices and carriers of disciplinary cultures (Paltridge, 2008). The examination of why texts are written as they are and how their composition are shaped by the constraints of instant communicative situations and the broad socio-cultural system lead to a thick description of the textual lives of community members. Textographic investigation of genres generates knowledge on static generic structures and also on the dynamic process of generic formation, evolution, and correlation. The method significantly enhances the interpreting potential of genre theory and turns it into a useful tool for discourse analysts to explore issues broadly related to academic and professional communication.

# 3.2. Data and analysis

The selection of textbooks was conducted by searching ELT textbooks currently on sale at three major Chinese online bookstores (www.dangdang.com, www.amazon.cn, www. book.jd.com) and by interviewing ten ELT practitioners of five Chinese universities related to their course materials and textbooks. A total of 18 textbooks were finally selected, all of which were published after the year of 2005 and were being used as course books across various Chinese universities and colleges. The researcher photocopied the preface section of these textbooks in order to form a set of independent documents for the convenience of coding and analyzing. There was a three-step linguistic examination of each of the texts. First, the researchers marked out salient organization and layout features, including titles, sub-titles, numerical items, color prints, sentences/ phrases in bold face or italics, indented text blocks, etc. Second, based on the work of step one, the researchers further read through the text thoroughly and managed to divide the whole text into separate functional moves. Third, within the identified moves, salient lexical and rhetorical structures which were crucial for the realization of the function of moves were spotted. The move pattern reported below is, of course, based the comparing and cross-checking of three researchers’ individual examining results of each text.

On the other hand, the institutional and cultural contexts where ELT textbooks were produced and consumed were handled through structured interviews with the 10 ELT practitioners and the accessing of policy documents. Insiders’ accounts thus acquired enabled the researchers to have a grounded understanding of the findings of the above linguistic examinations. Policy documents issued by the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China (MOE) and the educational authorities of lower Chinese provincial government were also approached in order to acquire more insights relating to the initiatives and influences of the marketization of Chinese ELT discipline.

# 3.3. The general move pattern

Textual analysis of the prefaces of 18 collected textbooks reveals the following ‘twolayered’ (Swales, 2004; Wong & Lim, 2014) move–step pattern:

Move 1: Invoking institutional realities

Step 1: The display of commercialization discourse   
Move 1 – Step1 encompasses a large number of institutional lexicons denoting the centralized reality of Chinese ELT discipline, e.g. history, forefathers, supreme authority, policy documents, nation-wide curriculum reforms and projects, and appraisal schemes. These institutional lexicons are included not for the purpose of collegial information sharing, as they refer mostly to widely-known facts of the discipline. They are carefully arranged to convince textbook users of the credit and value of textbooks.   
Step 2: The display of power negotiation discourse   
On the surface, this step is a text acknowledging those who have made contributions to the production of textbooks. The formal introduction of the contributing scholars and funding universities attributes authoritativeness over ordinary practitioners to textbook writers and their collaborators.

Move 2: Invoking specialist knowledge

Step 1: The display of power negotiation discourse

Textbook authors, in Move 2 – Step 1, adopt a privileged and instructional tone to deliver to other ELT practitioners their opinions regarding the design of ELT teaching materials and other fundamental issues concerning the whole discipline, e.g. curriculum design, materials preparation, research of language teaching, classroom pedagogy, and collegial collaboration. The writers’ intention of manifesting and consolidating their newly endowed authority is apparent.

Step 2: The display of commercialization discourse   
Although move Move 2 – Step 2 resembles Move 2 – Step 1 in the sense that both steps are heavily loaded with specialist vocabulary and lexicons, the purpose of collegial information is considerably played down by textbook writers’ agenda of promotion. The display of knowledge and expertise is less concerned with the maintaining of textbook writers’ authoritative identity, than with the purpose of commercial persuasion.

Textbook writers, in their actual writing, normally begin with Move 1 – Step 1, proceed to Move 2 – Steps 1 & 2, and then conclude with Move 1 – Step 2. This actually gives this genre a ‘sandwich’ structure (Yelland, 2011, p. 222) with the two steps of Move 1 wrapping the two steps of Move 2. The sequential pattern is given as below:

Move 1.1–Move 2.1–Move 2.2–Move 1.2.

This sandwich structure is suggestive of, among others, the dual identities of Chinese ELT discipline which is at the same time a government-controlled and self-autonomous profession. The explicit high profiling of institutional realities (Move 1) manifests textbook writers’ acknowledging and hailing of their government background. The filling of specialist disciplinary knowledge (Move 2) in the ‘sandwich’ implies that the gradually growing professional autonomy of Chinese ELT discipline presupposes the authorization and protection of government (MOE, 2006). The manifestation of textbook writers’ dual role as commercial textbook producers and authority-holders occurs to both moves equally. The prominence of the agenda of promoting is explicitly marked off in Move 1 – Step 1 the purpose of which is to differentiate the compiling team from many other competitors in the textbook market, and in Move 2 – Step 2 where ELT textbooks are taken as a product suitable for advertising and commercials. In contrast, the promotional agenda is of a lower degree of visibility in Move 1 – Step 2 and Move 2 – Step 1 because of the writers’ manifestation of their authoritative identity. Move 1 – Step 2 and Move 2 – Step1 involve much top-down instructional talks on the professional and institutional practices of the discipline. The following analysis brings more substance to the observations on the heterogeneity of commercial and power discourse in this genre.

# 4. Commercialization discourse

The uptake of market discourse in academic world is catalyzed largely by the reduction of public fund available for higher education and reflects governments’ quest for applied research in order to enhance national competiveness of economy and technology (Williams, 1995). Owing to an urgent need of including external financial support, professional academicians become more involved market actors striving for profits and commercial successes (Vauterin, Linnanen, & Marttila, 2011). They, not uncommonly, highlight the market value of academic activities and promote them in ways as much as other commercial goods are sold. Under this circumstance, the purpose of dialogues and interactions taking place within Chinese ELT discipline is significantly overshadowed by the practitioners’ promoting agendas.

# 4.1. The invoking of institutional realities (Move 1 – Step 1)

Textbook writers demonstrate an identifiable intention of promoting their books to potential buyers and users, as they construct Move 1 – Step 1 as competing narratives advertising the significance of the compiling project and the better-than-ever quality of textbooks. The discourse of advertising is ‘usually persuasive in nature’ and constructed to ‘promote products, services, people, or ideas to targeted audiences’ (Simons & Jones, 2011, p. 411). The content of Move 1 – Step 1 stresses textbooks compiling projects as a significant part of the glory Chinese ELT enterprise and accentuates the leading role of the government education authority in this process. The underlining of the government background of the discipline has always been an essential component of the genre since 1980s, but the invocation then is normally a symbolic mentioning that the compiling job is officially assigned by educational agencies of Chinese government. The traditional brief informational text is, now, significantly expanded into compelling narratives with a strong persuasive agenda, as illustrated in the following example:

Example text 1

(Situation) Chinese College English (specifically referring to ELT of university sectors) dates back to early eighties of the twentieth century, when the forefathers of foreign language teaching made College English Teaching Syllabus …   
(Problem) The arrival of new century … means a new start, a new pursuit …   
(Solution)The Ministry of Education is starting a number of schemes … New Horizon College English is one of the projects funded by these schemes.   
(Evaluation) Filled with inspiration and creation, the textbook empowers teachers and learners with brand new materials and methods. It is honored as ‘National Official Textbook’ and is on the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) list of recommended textbooks … We, textbook writers, are sincerely willing to join hands with all colleagues to work on the new ways of teaching … (Situation, Problem, Solution, and Evaluation are added by the present author for the purpose of analysis)

The text largely fits into the problem-solution pattern explicated in Hoey (2001) and depicts the textbook as a timely response to the needs of Chinese ELT enterprise. Drawing on institutional facts already widely-known for the discipline, the text constructs a progressive force of persuasion: from rapport-building (Situation), to coercive persuasion (Problem), and finally to authority endorsement (Solution, Evaluation). The writers’ intention of aligning customers becomes increasingly stronger. The invoking of forefathers of Chinese College English and their respectful works in Situation (‘forefathers’, ‘College English Teaching Syllabus’) appeals to the shared noble sense of belonging held between textbook authors and practitioners and successfully builds rapport with them.

The replacement of informational purpose with persuasive one becomes more evident in Problem where the writers manage to establish a forcible alignment with the audience. Problem points out that the change of the circumstance of the Situation causes uncertainties to the previously stable situations and appropriate responses/solutions are expected to restore the stability (Hoey, 2001, p. 66). Instead of referring to the development of concrete ELT practices, the trigger of these uncertainties in this text are attributed to grand but rather hollow notions, for example, ‘new century’. Similar notions used in other example texts include ‘the new national policy’, ‘the development of technology’, etc. Such grand notions, disclosing quite limited information, function much like the marks of ‘coercive persuasion’ (Ofshe, 1992). The effect of mind control thus achieved imposes a seemingly universally applicable statement on the part of audience, rendering no possibility of self-steered thinking and judgment. The strategic choice of lexicons naturally positions practitioners, that is, potential buyers, as textbook writers’ allies in appreciating the value of their compiling project.

Persuasion becomes most explicit in Solution and Evaluation which consist primarily of the language of promotion (‘inspiration’, ‘creation’, ‘brand new’, ‘empower’), endorsement (‘the Ministry of Education’, ‘National Official Textbook’), and incentive-giving (‘we … are sincerely willing to join hands … on the new ways of teaching’). The two sections foreground the compiling project as a government-dominated project. The explicit verbal attribution of achievements to the government educational authority (the Ministry of Education) creates a compelling endorsement of the textbook. Commenting on the effect of such persuasion, one senior teacher says:

Since every teacher, in theory, is entitled to compile textbooks and find a publishing house to release them to the open market, too many new textbooks are issued every year. Anyway, our choice is not that hard to make! It is important to select textbooks from the MOE’s list of recommendations or textbooks compiled under the MOE project ‘National Planned Teaching Materials’. The quality of these textbooks is much more trustworthy, as they are guaranteed by the government!

Promotional agenda is finally brought in straightforward when the selling points of the textbook (brand new, empower) is explicitly highlighted in the way commercial goods are advertised. The purposive downgrading of textbook writers revealed in the incentivegiving signals that the formerly powerless ‘authoritee’ (Fairclough, 1992, pp. 95–115), that is, ordinary ELT practitioners, are increasingly acquiring buying power to which authority-holders of the discipline need to appeal.

# 4.2. The invoking of specialist knowledge (Move 2 – Step 2)

In contrast to the foregrounding of institutional realities in Move 1 – Step 1, the agenda of persuasion in Move 2 – Step 2 is realized primarily through specialist descriptions of the structure and function of textbooks. The inclusion of specialist vocabulary and jargons (i.e. Cobuild TEFL corpus, communicative competence, language input, curriculum design, lifelong learning) are clear indicators that the genre is a highly technical texttype confined to a specialist audience, that is, ELT practitioners. Actually, specialist contents addressing scholarly research of language teaching, learning, and testing is a newly adopted element of this genre, in accordance with the recent shifting of the discipline from a purely practice-based community focusing solely on pedagogic activities to one that encourages and values scholarly research of applied linguistic issues (Cai, 2010; Xia, 2002). The newly emerged specialist texts are colonized by textbook writers’ marketing consideration as well.

The following text demonstrates how the writers carefully carve out the expert profile of textbooks for a promotional purpose:

# Example text 2:

The monitoring of student learning supported by the online platform accompanying the textbook creates good opportunities for teachers to manage assessment of various kind. Detailed records of learning process, homework and grades supply teachers a live knowledge of students’ autonomous learning. Available forms of assessment include self assessment, peer assessment, and teacher assessment of student performance, etc. Because the monitoring module integrates teaching, supervising, and testing and combines formative and summative assessments, teachers may acquire comprehensive, impartial, and accurate feedbacks regarding their teaching activities.

The colonization of promotional discourse over informational discourse in this text is salient because of the lack of content immediacy and the apparent feature of advertising language. The cluster of technical vocabulary and concepts related to language teaching and testing (‘homework and grades’, ‘autonomous learning’, ‘self assessment’, ‘peer assessment’, ‘formative and summative assessments’) contributes to a seemingly factual description, informing ELT practitioners of some basic facts of the textbook. However, these concepts are discussed on so much a general level as to bear little immediate relevance to the actuality of the textbook. For example, does the ‘learning process’ refer to the formal classroom teaching, the completion of homework, the self-study of texts and exercises, or all of them? Is ‘formative assessment’ part of the textbook content, or it refers to the separate assessment administered by teachers? Such particular questions about the textbook under discussion find no apparent answers in the text. The lack of immediacy, as a discursive feature typical of the genre of infomacials (Parsons & Rotfeld, 1990), turns the specialist description of textbook into rather general and unfalsifiable commercial statements. They are intensively packed here in order to highlight the multiple functioning and multi purposes of the textbook.

Moreover, the writers’ choice of topics is not without considerations. Most of the notions addressed here are hot-button issues for the present Chinese ELT curriculum reforms (see MOE, 2007, for details of the curriculum reform), for example, ‘autonomous learning’, ‘peer assessment’, and ‘formative assessment’. The invoking of these notions displays the writers’ timely observation of the reforming currency and their keen awareness of the discipline’s immediate concerns. This, in line with the concept of ‘impression management’ (Goffman, 1959, p. 203), demonstrates their expert identities and necessarily enhances the credibility of the textbook.

The feature of advertising language here refers to the explicit use of promotional language (‘good opportunities’, ‘assessment of various kinds’, ‘a live knowledge’, ‘comprehensive, impartial, and accurate feedbacks’) and the ‘ritual boasting’ (Cook, 2001, p. 234) of buyers/users as beneficiary of the textbook (‘for teachers’, ‘giver teachers’, ‘teachers may’). Textbooks writers are rhetorically portrayed as considerate textbook makers taking care of clients’ needs, but not the salesman worrying the commercial success of their products. These boosting expressions are all oriented toward the benefits customers may acquire from the using of the textbook, revealing the writers’ intent of making a direct psychological appeal to customers (Jenkins & Hinds, 1987). What is implied in this stretch of advertising text is an obvious effort of enticing immediate follow-up (buying) actions.

# 5. Power negotiation discourse

Marketization brings about the fragmentation of Chinese ELT discipline, besides driving the commercialization of its professional activities. Fragmentation of professional communities, according to Fairclough (1992, p. 220), denotes ‘a certain breakdown’ into more local orders of discourse and involves ‘greater variability of discursive practice’. A number of traditionally naturalized relations of power, in this process, becomes problematic and needs to be negotiated and re-established through community members’ visible efforts. One important aspect of the fragmentation of Chinese ELT discipline is the fragmentation of the formerly monolithic intellectual thoughts (Chen, 2002). The discipline traditionally holds that ELT concerns pedagogy only and bears little connection with scholarly researches, which can and should be regulated by uniform curriculum requirements and teaching ideologies. While the traditional belief meets the practical needs of educating skillful English language users and ensuring the consistent quality of ELT pedagogy, it hinders the development of the research enterprise of the discipline. The apparently underprivileged research profile of the discipline prompts the educational authority of Chinese government to loosen the intellectual control and nurture the diversification of scholarly ideas and thoughts related to ELT practices (Xia, 2007). Accordingly, the whole discipline is formed into various intellectual groups led by the government-endorsed professors and virtuoso practitioners. These groups have different, even conflicting, understanding of the nature of ELT practices, and they all consider textbooks as an important disciplinary genre of implementing their professional beliefs. Naturally, part of textbook prefaces is carefully constructed to publicize their beliefs in order to win the support of more practitioners and to consolidate the structure of the newly formed intellectual groups to which textbook writers belong. The purpose of engagement, in those situations, is authoritative communication and the commercial agenda is less evident.

# 5.1. The invoking of institutional realities (Move 1 – Step 2)

Textbook writers’ intention of manifesting institutional authority is demonstrated in their presentation of newly introduced western academic rituals, that is, the provision of a formal and lengthy acknowledgment. Acknowledging texts are scarce, if not absent at all, in the prefaces of Chinese ELT textbooks published before 1990s when the compilation of textbooks was largely an official government responsibility. Though confined to a restricted number of privileged professors and virtuoso practitioners, the compilation of ELT textbooks now becomes a professional job which requires collegial collaboration. The texts of Move 1 – Step 2 reflect this institutional reality of Chinese ELT discipline. The appropriate performance of newly introduced academic rituals shows the virtue of collegiality and functions as important stabilizers avoiding the improper erosion of the integrity of academic disciplines by the untamed market force (Whitley, 2008).

Move 1 – Step 2 is placed at the end of this genre and can be easily identified as an acknowledging text because of the noteworthy language of thanks-giving:

Example text 3

Distinguished professors and experienced teachers from six national key universities, i.e. Peking University, Nanjing University … collaborate closely to compile the textbook. They all have a rich experience of College English teaching and a good mastery of both English and Chinese language, and are all highly committed to the project. XYZ, a British language teaching expert, supplies invaluable assistance of textbook proofreading. The publishing house has been an excellent coordinator, successfully ensuring a smooth operation of the large compiling and editorial team … We hereby sincerely thank them all.

The close structural correspondence of the text with Searle’s ideal pattern of speech act of thanking (Searle, 1969) demonstrates the writers’ intent of conforming to the ritualized academic speech and reproducing the norms of disciplinary communication. Searle construes three conditions in terms of the speech act of thanking, that is, preparatory, sincerity, and essential (Searle, 1969, p. 66). Preparatory conditions mean that the speaker has benefited from some past acts done by the hearer (‘professors’, ‘teachers’, ‘XYZ’). Sincerity condition denotes that the speaker has the psychological state of feeling appreciative for the hearer. The existence of such a ‘mental process ascribing a thankful attitude’ (Martin & White, 2005, p. 59) to gratitude-recipients is shown directly by the speaker’s positive appreciation of the hearer’s attitudes (‘highly committed’) and activities (‘collaborate closely’, ‘invaluable assistance’, ‘successfully ensuring’). Essential conditions require the utterance to be a clear expression of gratitude, which is normally a clearly marked performative sentence (‘we hereby sincerely thank them all’). The strongest illocutionary force indicating devices ‘We hereby’, plus the performative verb ‘thank’, categorizes texts of this kind to typical instances of acknowledging text.

It is intriguing that the intensive use of positive evaluating language occurs not only to the speaker’s appreciative description of the benefits they receive, but also to the boosting of the contributors’ identity of professional excellence (‘distinguished’, ‘experienced’, ‘rich experience’, ‘good mastery’, ‘a British language teaching expert’) which seems not immediately relevant to the psychological state of feeling gratitude.

In addition to an intention of promoting textbooks by highlighting the expertise and credibility of the compiling team, the emphasis of the compilers’ professional excellence, according to insiders’ account, points to the writers’ partisan concerns with the fragmentation of Chinese ELT discipline. The force of marketization, as noted above, divides the discipline into various subgroups, and the text implicitly tells the prominent institutional and individual members of the group of which the authors are a part. The naming of these prestigious universities and professors the foregrounding of their expertise and authority of their collaborating professors is an effective strategy of publicizing the membership of their intellectual group among ordinary ELT practitioners. At the same time, textbook writers use this as a ‘positive politeness’ strategy (Brown & Levinson, 1987) showing collegial respect to their collaborators and as a strategy consolidating the intellectual compartmentalization of the academic discipline.

# 5.2. The invoking of specialist knowledge (Move 2 – Step 1)

Textbook writers’ purpose of persuading and recruiting practitioners is primarily realized in Move 2 – Step 1. The specialist wordings of this step are mostly related to controversial issues concerning the whole discipline. Some of them exposit the conflict of English for General Purposes and English for Specific Purposes, rote learning and task-based learning, audio-lingual teaching and communicative teaching, literature texts for aesthetic appreciation and professional texts for applied purposes, etc. The writers express their voices on these issues in rather an authoritative and unequal manner:

# Example text 4

(Specialist discourse) College English textbooks are English for General Purposes (EGP) course books, not English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course books. Its main purpose is to consolidate undergraduates’ EGP skills and competence, and the selecting of texts must follow a strict linguistic standard and cover a variety of genres and a wide scope of subject matters. In order to foster students’ curiosity and boost their learning of English, texts selected for College English should abide by the criteria of being interesting, informative, and thought-provoking … (Commercial discourse) The compiling project aims at achieving the integration of classic and modern texts and of science and humanities texts and manages to produce a textbook that cam stand the test of time … (Authoritative discourse, Commercial discourse are added by the present author)

This text is taken from a newly published ELT textbook widely used in universities in the area of Shanghai City, Jiangsu Province, and Zhejiang Province. According to the subject matters addressed, it consists of a specialist discussion of some general issues of Chinese ELT practices (‘EGP course’, ‘ESP course’, ‘EGP skills’, ‘linguistic standard’, ‘a variety of genres’) and a promotional description of the textbook (‘the integration of classic and modern texts and of science and humanities texts’, ‘stand the test of time’).

The contents of this text are different from its counterpart of Move 2 – Step 2 in two aspects. First, textbook writers here concentrate neither on the description of the compiling project nor on the evaluation of the textbook. The collective indefinite nouns (‘College English textbooks’, ‘texts selected’, ‘undergraduates’, ‘students’) refer the writers’ arguments to the current concerns of the whole discipline. Second, the assertive verbs (‘are’, ‘is’), the high degree ‘subjective modal verbs’ (Palmer, 2001, p. 33) (‘must’, ‘should’), and the norm-signifying words (‘criteria’, ‘abide by’) disclose the writers’ explicit intent of speaking in a top-down instructional manner. These grammatical devices leave no room of negotiation for the reception of their voices and strategically position listeners, that is, ELT practitioners, as subordinate and passive ‘addressees’ (Bell, 1984, p. 159). This demanding tone is hard to explain in the context of commercial discourse. Linguistic features of such a kind are clear evidence of textbook writers’ authoritative engagement with ordinary practitioners. The still partially centralized institutional reality of Chinese ELT discipline decides that the entitled textbook writers take a lecturing style in communicating with practitioners in order to fulfill their assigned duty of being policy-makers and leading scholars.

Naturally, the demanding tone is removed when the writers shift the writing focus to the promotional discussion of the textbook. The direct engagement between textbook authors as speakers and practitioners as addressees in the specialist discourse is replaced with the author’s dedicated portrayal of the textbook in the commercial context. Practitioners are repositioned as ‘auditors’ who are not directly addressed but have a judging power over the outcomes of the speakers’ rhetorical efforts (Bell, 1984, p. 160). What is completed is a subtle, but certain shift of power from the writers to the practitioners. The power shift is certain because the institutionally authoritative textbook writers have to find ways to accommodate the buying power of the consumer that the trend of marketization has given practitioners; the shift is subtle because the writers need to, at least rhetorically, mitigate the contradictions of their concurrent identities of institutional policy-makers and commercial textbook makers. The uneasy co-existence of authoritative institutional discourse and consumer-appealing commercial discourse is suggestive of the ongoing restructuring of organizational and power relationships among virtuoso and ordinary members of Chinese ELT discipline, as observed by one of our specialists:

Chinese universities have a large population of students, and textbook writers, particularly those of best selling ones, can earn a lot of money! Actually, they publish both nationally and internationally and are experts in the profession. Many of them work for think tanks of MOE and may exert an influential power on the shaping of this country’s curriculum and examination policies. A lot of my colleagues are eager to get to know them, you know, we can learn much from them on how to teach and on how to do research!

# 6. Conclusion

As demonstrated, this study refuses a simplistic understanding of Chinese ELT textbook prefaces as highly structured disciplinary genre fulfilling only the normative purpose of introduction. The force of marketization turns this genre into a crucial site for the interplay of different and, sometimes, contesting discourses: institutional discourse, specialist discourse, authoritative discourse, and commercial discourse. Because of the concurrent consideration of the communication with colleagues and the communication with consumers, its assumed informational purpose experiences two seemingly contradictory changes. On the one hand, the genre becomes less informational because the introduction of the compiling project (Move 1 – Step 1) and the structure of textbooks (Move 2 – Step 2) are heavily colonized (Hoey, 2001, p. 77) by the commercial discourse, where the conveyance of newsworthy information ceases to be a focal consideration and what is foregrounded are ELT textbook writers’ promotional agenda. On the other hand, this genre becomes more informational in the sense that it includes new texts related to the institutional realities (Move 1 – Step 2) and professional practices (Move 2 – Step 1) of Chinese ELT discipline. The contents of these new texts are, to a greater or lesser extent, detached from the immediate discussion of textbooks, and the primary consideration is to re-negotiate the relations of power within the discipline and to redefine its identity and integrity.

The discursive findings reveal some aspects of the significant changes the uptake of market discourse brings to the organization and operation of Chinese ELT discipline. Two restructuring tendencies are noteworthy: (1) the commercialization of disciplinary activities and (2) the fragmentation of institutional structures. The trend of marketization demands a number of teaching and research activities of the discipline to be operated on the basis of commercial and managerial ideas. Chinese ELT practitioners, textbook writers in this case, are required to talk like salesmen competing with their rivals and promoting their commodities by appealing to the authority of the consumer. The trend of fragmentation is less related to the commercial aspect of the disciplinary change. Instead, it points to its organizational restructuring, that is, the formerly singular government-controlled discourse community is fragmented into multiple local groups of practitioners of pluralistic understandings regarding disciplinary values and ideologies. Textbook writers, as entitled leaders of the community, assume the duty of steering its restructuring, whereby they demonstrate authority and control over ordinary practitioners. The orchestrating of the seemingly uncompromising identities – commercial textbook makers and authoritative policy-makers – imposes a great challenge on the part of textbook writers and other virtuoso practitioners alike and its solution calls for the creative mixing (Bhatia, 2010) of heterogeneous discourse types and the innovative maneuver of disciplinary genres.
