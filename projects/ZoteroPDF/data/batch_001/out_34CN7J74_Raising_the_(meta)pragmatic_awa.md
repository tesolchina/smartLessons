Metapragmatic awareness

This study aims to determine whether a data-driven learning approach in a telecollaborative setting can effectively aid in the preparation of non-native pre-service teachers (PSTs) of Italian concerning pragmatic aspects of the target language. The study outlines a 4-week telecollaboration module focusing on formal email writing, involving eight PSTs at an Austrian university paired with Italian students. The participants were asked to analyze specific parts of emails written by native and non-native speakers and plan a lesson. The data analyzed came from questionnaires as well as from materials produced during the module itself. Ten Italian university professors offered baseline data. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis were employed. The results indicate, on one hand, a small but significant improvement in the PSTs’ understanding of target pragmatic phenomena after the intervention. On the other hand, not all the teaching strategies suggested in the module were fully grasped for potential future use by the PSTs. However, there is some evidence of PSTs’ autonomy in investigating, analyzing, and reflecting on pragmatic issues, offering a promising approach to enhancing teacher training in pragmatics.

# 1. Introduction

This study seeks to determine whether adopting a data-driven learning (DDL) approach in a telecollaborative setting can effectively complement more conventional teaching methods in the preparation of future L2 Italian instructors with regards to pragmatic aspects of the target language. The investigation specifically addresses the pragmatics of formal email writing in the context of Tyrolean preservice teacher (henceforth PST) education.

Despite the prevalence of non-native speakers among L2 teachers, pragmatic instruction remains largely absent from teachertraining programs (Gauci et al., 2017). Non-native teachers often perceive themselves as lacking in pragmatic expertise, leading to feelings of uncertainty regarding language appropriateness. However, the instruction of pragmatics should be rooted in research findings rather than relying solely on teachers’ intuitions. Hence, a crucial aspect of training both non-native and native-speaking language instructors is to augment their pragmatic awareness and cultivate their capacity for independent analysis of pragmatic phenomena (Glaser, 2020).

The synergy between telecollaboration and DDL creates a perfect setting for nurturing autonomy and enhancing awareness (Boulton, 2017). This combination may help PSTs comprehend that both native speakers and rules from books do not serve as the exclusive authority on language use. Instead, teachers should rely on autonomously conducted data-based research to inform their decisions when promoting activities that enhance awareness of pragmatics. Telecollaboration has gained prominence in recent de cades as a valuable activity that fosters teacher professional development and facilitates the adoption of technology-enhanced communicative practices (Wu, 2021). Still, there is not much research to demonstrate the effectiveness of telecollaborative DDL in developing metapragmatic awareness. Regarding the training of future Italian language teachers, there is no prior research conducted in this specific direction as far as we are aware.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical underpinnings of the study, encompassing (meta)pragmatic awareness, telecollaboration, and DDL within the context of teacher training. Section 3 presents the research questions, while Section 4 outlines the methodological aspects of the study, including participants, materials, and procedures for data collection and analysis. Section 5 is devoted to presenting and discussing the results, and Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.

# 2. Literature review

The constructs of pragmatic and metapragmatic awareness, telecollaboration, and DDL constitute the theoretical underpinnings of the study. In the following sections, these will be illustrated and related to the context in which this study is situated, namely that of teacher training.

# 2.1. (Meta)pragmatic awareness and L2 teacher training

The now extensive literature exploring the relationship between second language and pragmatics provides partially different definitions of pragmatic awareness, although all broadly revolve around the concepts of consciousness, reflection, and explicit knowledge of pragmatic meanings. According to Timpe-Laughlin et al. (2021, p. 2), despite the fact that “the term ‘pragmatic awareness’ has been utilized in almost every publication within the realm of L2 pragmatics research, the specific meaning of pragmatic awareness and the process of its acquisition remain far from clearly defined”. By synthetizing previous definitions, the authors describe pragmatic awareness as the conscious comprehension of pragmatics, which becomes apparent in a learner’s capacity to identify sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic phenomena entailed in the mechanism of form-function-context mapping.

Similarly, the differentiation between pragmatic and metapragmatic awareness is subject to slightly diverse interpretations among scholars (van Compernolle & Kinginger, 2013, p. 299). This paper embraces Ifantidou, 2014 distinction: pragmatic awareness is regarded as the capacity to employ and recognize linguistic forms in a contextually appropriate manner, whereas metapragmatic awareness entails the conscious reflection on the underlying reasons behind form-function-context mapping mechanisms.

The development of conscious reflective capacity is of crucial importance to the very nature of pragmatics. Given that the context is a flexible core point of reference, and a clear-cut dichotomy of correct and incorrect pragmatic behavior cannot be identified, teaching may focus on the development of learners’ awareness by relying on authentic input and corpus linguistics (Timpe-Laughlin et al., 2015, p. 20). In essence, learners should be placed in a position to become researchers and analysts of pragmatic phenomena within extensive linguistic usage samples.

This holds particularly true within the realm of teacher training, as prospective educators should also cultivate the skill of effec tively imparting their knowledge to their future pupils. It is worth noting that many language teachers are L2 speakers whose own command of the target language may be weak (Long, 2015, p. 17), which frequently leaves them uncertain about pragmatic aspects (Cohen, 2018). As emphasized by Glaser (2020, p. 34), the perceived deficiency in pragmatic knowledge and/or intuition, along with resulting insecurities regarding language appropriateness, often leads them to be more comfortable instructing on language accuracy aspects (such as grammar, vocabulary, etc.). It is true that, on the one hand, native speakers and learners may tend to emphasize different aspects when assessing the pragmatic appropriateness of language use. For instance, in student-faculty emails, Greek learners were observed to give higher importance to the message’s formality, as opposed to its content or social-pragmatic attributes, in comparison to native speakers (Economidou-Kogetsidis, 2023). On the other hand, however, research has demonstrated that intuitions of native speakers may not accurately represent the realization of speech acts and could potentially misjudge the significance of certain elements in authentic conversations (Glaser, 2014). Hence, fostering heightened reflective awareness and placing reliance on genuine input and corpus linguistics appear to be essential components in teacher training. The optimal environment for seamlessly integrating these two elements is telecollaboration, specifically within a setting that encourages research-based learning.

# 2.2. Telecollaboration and DDL by PSTs

Telecollaboration is a form of online learning that involves geographically distanced participants who interact and collaborate through social media and communication technologies. It has been increasingly widely used in foreign language teaching for the last quarter of a century, as it offers authentic and meaningful opportunities for language learners to communicate with native or expert speakers of the target language and culture (Sadler & Dooly, 2016). Telecollaboration has been demonstrated to have a positive in fluence on language learning outcomes – such as the learners’ focus on form (Akiyama, 2014; Li, 2020) or pragmatic competence (Baroni et al., 2019; Chun, 2011) – and motivation (Schenker, 2012). Telecollaboration in teacher education also supports the development of intercultural collaborative competences and digital literacy (Rets et al., 2023; Yang, 2020), which are essential skills in the 21st century (Tondeur et al., 2017), and mirrors timely ways to work and build knowledge within a connectivist approach (Goldie,

2016). For PSTs, a telecollaboration experience also offers an experiential kind of learning (Kurek & Müller-Hartmann, 2017) and therefore provides an opportunity both to experience the tools and processes that they will need to use in their own classrooms in the future and to reflect on their learning outcomes with peers in an authentic context. Hauck et al. (2020) highlight the potential of telecollaboration to combine technology and pedagogy, and advocate for the systematic integration of telecollaboration into teacher education programs.

Telecollaboration is built upon a fundamental principle that has been at the core of pedagogy for the past century: the ability to learn through interaction (Sadler & Dooly, 2022). The concept of interactive learning can be traced back to the theories of Dewey and Vygotsky, namely the pragmatism and the sociocultural theory, which propose that learners can benefit from engaging with peers who have varying levels of expertise and perspectives: this is exemplified by the (meta)pragmatic awareness of both native and non-native speakers (Economidou-Kogetsidis, 2023). Thus, the aim to increase learners’ awareness in a telecollaborative setting holds promise for yielding results.

As a means to encourage purposeful and goal-oriented use of the target language (Dooly & Vinagre, 2022), telecollaboration aligns well with communicative approaches such as task-based or project-based language teaching (Kurek & Müller-Hartmann, 2017). Additionally, telecollaboration can encompass data-driven learning (DDL), as exemplified in the intervention described in this paper. DDL is an approach that promotes students’ analysis of language with corpus data, encouraging the process of inquiry, investigation and discovery with authentic material in order to learn the target language with greater autonomy (Boulton & Vyatkina, 2021). DDL is also a method designed to develop a cadre of life-long, self-directed researchers – a trait of paramount importance for professionals facing a constantly evolving world. For PSTs, DDL provides an experiential learning episode that enables pedagogical choices based on their individual research encounters and potentially shapes their future teaching (Boulton & Tyne, 2014). The application of the DDL approach holds particular promise for addressing the area of pragmatics within foreign language teaching. This promise stems from the inherent links between interlanguage pragmatics and internal variation, as well as DDL’s potential to overcome the challenges associated with teaching complex pragmatic nuances and fostering pragmatic awareness in the L2. The use of DDL in a telecollaboration with native speakers also allows the primacy of the native speaker to be broken down, as it forces both groups to base their hypotheses on corpus data.

# 3. Research questions

This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of a DDL approach in a telecollaborative context as a valuable supplement to traditional teaching methods for training future L2 Italian instructors. It specifically investigates the potential impact of a DDL telecollaborative module on improving (meta)pragmatic awareness and teaching skills related to formal email writing in the context of Tyrolean PST education. In pursuit of this objective, the following main research questions are posed:

RQ1: Does the pragmatic and metapragmatic awareness of PSTs of Italian in Austrian Tyrol evolve throughout a 4-week DDL module on the pragmatic aspects of writing formal emails? If so, how?   
RQ2: How does the DDL telecollaborative experience reflect on the PSTs’ perspectives regarding how to teach the pragmatics of writing formal emails?

The above research questions were operationalized as follows:

RQ1a): How accurate are PSTs’ judgments about the pragmatic aspects of writing formal emails (pragmatic awareness) before and after completing the module?   
RQ1b): To what extent do PSTs demonstrate the ability to consciously reflect on the underlying reasons behind form-functioncontext mapping mechanisms (metapragmatic awareness) before, during, and after the module?   
RQ2a): What perspectives on how to teach the pragmatics of writing formal emails are evident in the PSTs’ reflections on the telecollaborative DDL experience?   
RQ2b): How do the lesson plans created by the PSTs at the conclusion of the module reflect the application of knowledge and skills acquired during the telecollaborative activities?

# 4. Method

The study involved two groups of informants, the PSTs and the experts, presented in Section 4.2, and followed a pre/postintervention design, where the intervention consisted of the telecollaboration module illustrated in Section 4.4. The data analyzed came from questionnaires (Section 4.3) as well as from materials produced during the module itself. As outlined in Fig. 1, the data were collected in three phases: before the intervention, during the intervention, and after the intervention. The targeted pragmatic features will be described in Section 4.1.

The research project underwent an ethical self-assessment as provided by the University Ethics Committee (Taglieber et al., 2022) prior to gathering the data. Participants were informed of their rights under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016/679) and asked to consent to the scientific use and publication of their responses. Data do not include sensitive cases.

# 4.1. The targeted pragmatic features

The pragmatic features chosen as the focal points for this study pertain to formal email writing. We opted to focus on this domain due to its significant relevance in teacher training. The CEFR Companion Volume (Council of Europe, 2020, p. 94) highlights the significance of professional email writing, particularly emphasizing the need for appropriate pragmatic choices. Furthermore, the literature acknowledges that composing emails poses multiple challenges for L2 learners, as poor decisions related to either communicative purpose or language usage can lead to unfavorable assessments of the sender’s personality (Economidou-Kogetsidis, 2011; Economidou-Kogetsidis et al., 2021; Luijkx et al., 2022; Savi´c, 2018).

In line with most current research on emails between students and faculty staff, we focused on request emails “because these are likely the most common types of emails written by students in educational contexts” (Nguyen & Pham, 2021, p. 43).

International literature focuses extensively on the opening (salutations, terms of address) and closing sections (pre-closings and leave-takings) of student emails, as well as the strategies used to perform and mitigate requests. For instance, email requests in English by Greek and Chinese learners tend to be more direct than those of native speakers (Economidou-Kogetsidis et al., 2021; Halenko & Winder, 2021). In terms of openings, German students writing in English are more likely to omit titles (e.g., Professor) than gendered forms (e.g., Ms.), likely due to L1 transfer (Schauer, 2021). The preference for formality in the openings and closings of emails by Greek learners of English (Economidou-Kogetsidis et al., 2021) aligns with L1 norms, likely reflecting Greek society’s orientation toward positive politeness (Sifianou, 2010). Opening, requesting and closing formulas are not simply vestiges of traditional letter writing, but serve crucial socio-pragmatic functions, establishing social hierarchies and interpersonal distance between the writer and recipient (McKeown & Zhang, 2015). These elements are critical points where culture-specific traits and first language (L1) transfer phenomena most prominently emerge, often leading to pragmatic inadequacies in non-native speakers’ emails (Economidou-Kogetsidis et al., 2021; Schauer, 2021), even after periods of language immersion (Halenko & Winder, 2021).

Previous research on Italian students’ request emails to professors has analyzed their structure and wording, showing that a recurring structure can be identified consisting of four sections: opening, main part, closing, and signature (Andorno, 2015). Research also emphasizes that Italian students writing emails to their professors report the highest levels of insecurity in “how to start,” “how to conclude,” and “how to make requests” (Pagliara, 2018, p. 92). This is likely due to the lack of a standardized approach to email openings and closings in Italian (Andorno, 2015), which contrasts with languages like German, where such conventions are more clearly defined (Schauer, 2021). Andorno underscores students’ willingness to adopt a formal register when writing emails, despite the increasing informality common in Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC). However, students often struggle with maintaining this formal register. These difficulties manifest in several ways: inconsistencies in the use of formulaic expressions (e.g., cordiale professoressa, ‘kind professor’, or egregi saluti, ‘dear regards’), an overuse of bureaucratic language echoing formal commercial correspondence (e.g., in fede, lit. ‘In faith’, alla cortese attenzione di …, ‘to the kind attention of … ‘), and inconsistent lexical choices, which result in a noticeable oscillation of register.

Summarizing the information obtained from the cited works and the scrutiny of a previously collected corpus of elicited students’ emails (Brocca, 2024, cf. 4.4), we decided to focus the study on the elements most frequently examined in the literature, and where learners appear to be most vulnerable, according to both scholarly observation and self-perception, namely:

1. The adjective which accompanies the name and/or title of the addressee in the opening salutation (e.g., gentile, lit. ‘gentle’; gen tilissima, lit. ‘very gentle’ [feminine]), like in Gentile professore or Gentilissima Maria Rossi;   
2. The title and/or name of the addressee in the opening salutation (e.g., professoressa, ‘professor’ [feminine]; dottor Rossi, ‘doctor Rossi’; also in the short forms prof./prof.ssa and dott./dott.ssa);   
3. The introductory sentence (e.g., le scrivo per [ground], ‘I’m writing for [ground]’; sono una studentesse del corso xy, ‘I’m a student from the course xy’);   
4. The request in the body of the message (e.g., le sarei grato se potesse rimandare …, ‘I would be grateful if you could postpone … ‘);   
5. The concluding sentence, (e.g., ringraziandola per la risposta, ‘thanking you for your reply’);   
6. The leave-taking formula (e.g., cordiali saluti, ‘kind regards’; cordialmente, ‘kindly’).

# 4.2. The participants

The study relies on the data provided by two groups of informants: eight PSTs and ten Italian university professors.

# 4.2.1. The PSTs

Fourteen PSTs enrolled in an Italian Language Pedagogy course at the Faculty of Teacher Education, Innsbruck University were included in the study. From this group, we identified eight monolingual PSTs whose L1 was Austrian-German as our target participants. Among these PSTs, seven were female and one was male, all of whom were in their fourth semester. On average, they were 20.5 years old $( \mathrm { { S D } } = . 7 )$ . Seven PSTs assessed their Italian proficiency at level B2 of the CEFR (Council of Europe, 2020), while one student declared level B1.

# 4.2.2. The experts

Ten university professors, native speakers of Italian and teachers of various subjects (excluding linguistics and language teaching) in Central and Northern Italy, were selected as experts to provide baseline data. These informants (henceforth, the experts) were on average 48.2 years old (SD 6.6), and seven of them were male.

# 4.3. The questionnaires

Each group of participants was surveyed online using different variants of the same questionnaire.

# 4.3.1. The PSTs’ questionnaires

An online survey (available in the online appendix) addressing the PSTs was administered individually before (pre-intervention) and after (post-intervention) the telecollaboration module, described below, in Section 4.4. The pre-intervention questionnaire encompassed a compilation of demographic data, an exploration of previous experience in formal email writing, and an assessment of PSTs’ perspectives on the instruction of formal email writing. In addition, the questionnaire featured five request emails to assess. Four of them included the six parts listed in Section 4.1, whereas one (email 4) comprised only four parts, as it lacked an explicit request and a concluding sentence separated from the closing salutations. The emails were taken from the L2 sub-corpus of the Ladder corpus (Brocca, 2024), with orthographic and morphosyntactic errors corrected. Some of the emails were merged to ensure that each con tained the target features, along with at least one pragmatic infelicity. The target parts were numbered to facilitate their separate assessment, as exemplified in (1).

Gentilissimo (1) sig.re [nome del docente](2),

non ho avuto il tempo per preparare la presentazione di domani, perch\`e ho dovuto studiare per un importante esame di inglese. Dato che il materiale \`e molto ho ancora bisogno di un po’ di tempo (3).

Per questo motivo le sarei grato se potessi rimandare la presentazione. (4)

La ringrazio in anticipo per la comprensione. (5)

Cordialmente (6)

‘Dear (1) Mr. [name of the teacher] (2),

I haven’t had the time to prepare tomorrow’s presentation because I had to study for an important English exam. Since the material is extensive, I still need a little more time (3).

For this reason, I would be grateful if you could postpone the presentation. (4)

Thank you in advance for your understanding. (5)

Sincerely (6)’

The participants were instructed to evaluate the appropriateness of each part using a four-point Likert scale or to choose the option ‘I cannot answer, I don’t know’. For each email, the Likert scale evaluation was followed by two open-ended questions:

1) Nota qualcosa di particolarmente gentile o di particolarmente scortese? Che cosa? (‘Do you notice anything particularly polite or particularly rude? What is it?‘)   
2) Se un/a alunno/a scrivesse questa mail durante un esercizio in classe, correggerebbe qualcosa? Che cosa? (‘If a student wrote this email during a classroom exercise, would you make any corrections? What would you correct?‘)

To facilitate a direct comparison of responses before and after the telecollaboration module (cf. 4.4), the post-intervention ques tionnaire was identical to the pre-intervention questionnaire, with two exceptions: five open-ended questions were added to prompt reflections on formal email teaching and the telecollaborative DDL experience, and the biographical items and the questions about previous experience in formal email writing were removed.

# 4.3.2. The experts’ questionnaire

The online survey addressing the experts (cf. Section 4.2.2) was administered individually once. Beside the demographic data, the questionnaire featured the same five request emails and Likert-scale questions as in the PSTs’ questionnaires, and the open-ended

question 1.

# 4.4. The telecollaboration module

After administering the pre-intervention questionnaire to the PSTs (cf. 4.3.1), a DDL telecollaboration module spanning 4 weeks was organized during the latter part of the Spring semester 2023, specifically from April 17th to May 15th (cf. Fig. 1). The module involved the pairing of the fourteen PSTs presented in Section 4.2.1 with fourteen Italian students who were attending an under graduate Second Language Pedagogy course at Roma Tre University. They engaged in weekly video calls of about $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ (but no time limits were imposed) to complete four tasks involving the analysis of a corpus of 120 emails (authored by $3 0 \mathrm { L } 1$ and 30 L2 speakers of Italian and extracted from the Ladder Corpus, Brocca, 2024), and the development of a lesson plan. All instructions were delivered in Italian (an English translation is reported in the online appendix: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZP978), and participants were required to employ Italian for both their communication and task fulfillment. The primary goal for the dyads was to collaboratively produce a written output for each assigned task, all the while videorecording their conversations. Both the recorded video sessions and the written materials generated as outcomes of their collaboration were subsequently uploaded onto a learning management system.

The first task involved the comparison of two L1 Italian emails and two L2 Italian emails, with a particular focus on the target features presented in Section 4.1. Additionally, participants were prompted to evaluate the level of politeness exhibited in these emails and to engage in discussions regarding instances where discrepancies in assessment might arise between the members of the dyad.

The second task required participants to randomly select ten L1 and ten L2 emails, and to identify the target features in all of them. Participants were encouraged to undertake a comparative analysis of the expressions found in the selected emails. This included discussions regarding the appropriateness of certain expressions over others, along with explanations for their judgments.

In the third task, each dyad was directed to choose one of the more formulaic parts of the L1 and L2 emails (specifically, parts 1, 2, 5, and 6, cf. Section 4.1) that had been identified in the previous activity. Their objective was to perform a quantitative analysis of the expressions employed in these specific parts within the entire corpus. To facilitate these analyses, a shared spreadsheet was provided to all participants. Following the analysis, participants were encouraged to review and engage in discussions centered around the observed results, with a particular emphasis on comparing the expressions used between L1 and L2 emails.

The fourth and final task entailed the creation of a lesson plan for a task-based teaching unit aimed at high school Austrian students learning Italian as L2. The primary focus of this teaching unit was to enhance the learners’ pragmatic skills in composing formal emails. To aid the PSTs in this task, they were furnished with a comprehensive guide designed to assist in the formulation of a structured lesson plan. They were also invited to use the corpus of emails analyzed in the previous phases of the telecollaborative module.

# 4.5. Data analysis

The following sections will illustrate the methods used to analyze the data quantitatively (Section 4.5.1) to answer RQ1a, and qualitatively (Section 4.5.2) to answer RQ1b, RQ2a, and RQ2b.

# 4.5.1. Quantitative analysis

To answer RQ1a, we analyzed the responses to the Likert-scale answers using descriptive statistics to pinpoint specific areas of interest and cross-reference the qualitative data. The responses of the PSTs before and after the telecollaboration were compared with a baseline constructed from the modal values of the experts’ judgments. To measure the distance of the PSTs responses from the baseline, a three-point scale was used. Zero indicates identity with the baseline, meaning the PST’s response matches the baseline in rating the appropriateness of a particular part of the email on the Likert scale. One represents cases in which the PST’s response was one level of distance away from the baseline. This applied, for example, when respondents have judged a part of the email as fully appropriate (rank 1 on the Likert scale), while the baseline ranked it as not fully appropriate (rank 2 on the Likert scale). This procedure continues for higher numbers on the scale, indicating greater degrees of disparity from the baseline. The statistical analyses were conducted with the R programming language (v. 4.2.2.; see R Core Team, 2022) and the tidyverse package (v. 1.3.2; see Wickham et al., 2019). In particular, the data were manipulated with tidyr (v.1.3.0; see Wickham et al., 2023), dplyr (v 1.0.10; see Wickham et al., 2022), and graphics were rendered using the ggplot 2 (see Wickham, 2016) package.

# 4.5.2. Qualitative analyses

RQ1b was addressed by identifying any variation in the PSTs’ metapragmatic awareness exhibited after the completion of the telecollaboration module. To this aim, the pre-intervention and post-intervention questionnaire responses to the open-ended questions about the appropriateness of the target parts of the emails were analyzed. Specifically, we identified all the cases in which the re spondents provided an explanation for why an expression was deemed inappropriate, instead of simply expressing a judgment of inappropriateness or suggesting a more appropriate alternative. Additionally, metapragmatic comments regarding language-specific features of email formal writing were isolated in PSTs’ responses to the post-questionnaire items that prompted reflections on the telecollaborative DDL experience, and in materials generated during the video calls within the telecollaboration module. These pieces of information did not allow for a pre/post comparison, but provided an overview of the reflections stimulated by the activity regarding the pragmatic characteristics of formal email writing in Italian.

To answer RQ2a, any comments revealing the perspectives of the PSTs regarding teaching and lesson planning were identified in the post-questionnaire items that prompted reflections on the telecollaborative DDL experience. A qualitative content analysis was conducted with inductive category formation (Mayring, 2022) using the web application QCAmap (www.qcamap.org): the PSTs’ responses were carefully reviewed to identify recurring themes and patterns, which were then grouped into categories based on their emergent properties.

Finally, RQ2b was addressed by analyzing the teaching unit lesson plans created by the PSTs and their Italian partners as the final outcome of the fourth task of the module (cf. Section 4.4). In this case, the analysis was essentially descriptive, aiming to identify the strategies that the PSTs considered most appropriate to teach formal email writing to their future students.

# 5. Results and discussion

The following sections present the results of the analysis, divided by RQ. The results will then be discussed in Section 5.5.

# 5.1. PSTs’ pragmatic awareness (RQ1a)

The results of the email judgments by PSTs and the experts were analyzed. The variances and standard deviations (SD) of the PSTs’ judgments before and after the intervention, along with those of the experts providing the baseline, were calculated, revealing a high level of individual variability in the ratings, especially among the experts (Variance 1.49, SD 1.22).

An independent two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction was used to compare each of the PST’s judgments in the pre- and post-questionnaire with the baseline and with each other. This non-parametric test was chosen due to the quasi-interval nature of the data and their non-normal distribution (Levshina, 2015, p. 110). The test statistic W before and after the intervention was found to be 25,319 and 22,980, respectively. The p-values obtained from the Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing the PSTs’ and experts’ judgments were statistically significant $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ both before and after the module. Additionally, the differences between the learners’ judgments in the pre- and post-phase were statistically significant at the $\alpha = . 0 5$ level $( \mathrm { W } = 2 7 , 7 2 1$ , $\pmb { p = \cdot 0 2 8 3 } )$ . Fig. 2, presented as a stacked bar chart, illustrates the degree to which the PSTs differed from the baseline rating both before (left bar) and after (right bar) the module. The figure shows that the PSTs’ ratings became more closely aligned with the baseline after the intervention. 99 responses out of 224 matched the baseline in the pre-questionnaire, while 124 were in alignment with the baseline after the telecollaboration module. On the other hand, it can be observed that the number of judgments that deviate from the baseline by 2 or $3 ^ { \circ }$ remained almost unchanged.

To gain further insights, we analyzed the variation of the agreement with the baseline –referred to as ‘pre-distance’ and ‘postdistance’– across different sections of emails. Fig. 3 presents this analysis through a series of stacked bar charts, with each stacked bar chart comparing pre- and post-distance side by side for every email examined (represented on the $\mathbf { X }$ -axis) and for each distinct part of these emails (delineated on the y-axis). Specifically, we analyzed the five emails, ordering them from top to bottom (from email 1 to email 5) in the figure. For each email, up to six pairs of stacked bars illustrate the assessments made for individual sections (labeled p1 through p6). Areas within dashed rectangles highlight sections judged by our baseline to be entirely or partially inappropriate.

In interpreting Fig. 3, we employ the following approach: (i) we identify components aligned with the baseline from the preintervention time; (ii) we pinpoint sections of the emails that demonstrated improvement following the intervention; and (iii) we highlight any instances where the ratings diverged, both in the pre-intervention and in the post-intervention phases.

i) The following parts of the emails were judged as adequate by the baseline raters and by the PSTs in both the pre- and postquestionnaire: Mail 1 p5 (Grazie in anticipo per la sua comprensione, ‘Thank you in advance for your understanding’), Mail 3 p1 (Gentile prof. Brocca, ‘Dear prof. Brocca’), and Mail 4 p1 (Egregio, lit. ‘Excellent’).   
ii) The following items were deemed adequate by the experts, and the PSTs found them adequate only in the post-questionnaire, thus showing an improvement in their agreement with the baseline after the module: Mail 1 p6 (Cordialmente, ‘Sincerely’), Mail ${ 2 { \tt p } } 2$ (Professor Brocca), Mail 2 p6 (Cordiali saluti, ‘Kind regards’), Mail 3 p5 (Grazie, ‘Thank you’), Mail 5 p4 (Per questo motivo Le chiedo cortesemente di spostare la presentazione, ‘Therefore, I kindly ask you to reschedule the presentation’), Mail 5 p6 (AugurandoLe buon proseguimento di giornata La saluto cordialmente, ‘Wishing you a good continuation of the day, I cordially greet you’).   
iii) The following cases were judged as inadequate by the baseline (with the only exception of Spett. le [], which was judged as almost inadequate), but not by the PSTs, neither prior nor after the intervention: Mail 1 p2 (sig. Brocca, ‘Mr. Brocca’), Mail 2 p4 (Per favore, rimandiamo la presentazione?, lit., ‘Please, are we postponing the presentation?‘), Mail 3 p2 (Buongiorno, ‘Good morning’), Mail 3 p4 (Per caso potrebbe rimandare la presentazione?, ‘By any chance, could you postpone the presentation?‘), Mail 3 p6 (Tanti saluti, ‘Many greetings’), and Mail 5 p1 (Spett.le, lit., ‘Respectable’).

In summary, the PSTs’ evaluations of the appropriate parts of the emails had greater agreement with the baseline after the tele collaboration module. Instead, their ability to identify pragmatic infelicities did not show any improvement after the intervention.

# 5.2. PSTs’ metapragmatic awareness (RQ1b)

The qualitative analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions about the appropriateness of the target parts of the emails did not reveal any notable change in the PSTs’ ability to consciously reflect on the underlying reasons behind form-function-context mapping mechanisms. In fact, an equivalent number (30) of comments reflecting metapragmatic awareness were identified both before and after the module.

Below are some examples of comments that have been identified as manifestations of metapragmatic awareness. Examples (2) and (3) are taken from the pre-questionnaire, while (4) and (5) from the post-questionnaire. In (2), the respondent refers to the title of the addressee in the opening salutation and shows awareness of the sociopragmatic norm underlying the choice of the appropriate address form for a university teacher.

(2) Correggerei $\romannumeral 1$ “sig.” con “prof.” visto che si tratta di un professore. (‘I would correct the “sig.” with “prof.” given that they are dealing with a professor’).

Example (3) refers to the request in the body of the message, and specifically to the justification provided to support the request. According to the respondent, the explanation provided (‘I didn’t have time to prepare the presentation because I was at a baroque music festival’) is not acceptable in the context of a formal email to a professor.

(3) Il motivo della parte 3 sembra scortese perch´e non \`e davvero una giustificazione per rimandare la presentazione. (‘The reason of part 3 seems rude because it’s not really a justification for postponing the presentation.‘)

The same pragmatic target is commented on in example (4), where the respondent explains that the lack of an explicit request to have the presentation postponed makes the message sound impolite.

(4) L’alunno ha gia \` fissato che va bene che non fa la presentazione e a me sembra molto scortese perch\`e non \`e nemmeno sua scelta. L’alunno dovrebbe almeno chiedere se sarebbe possibile avere più tempo … (‘The student has already decided that it’s okay not to do the presentation, and to me, it seems very rude because it’s not even his choice. The student should at least ask if it would be possible to have more time … ‘)

Finally, the leave-taking formulas are commented on in (5), with reference to the degree of formality expected in this type of email.

(5) Alla fine la mail \`e troppo confidenziale, dovrebbe usare p. e. “cordiali saluti” o “La ringrazio in anticipo”. (‘At the end, the email is too informal, s/he should use, for example, “cordiali saluti” or “la ringrazio in anticipo”.‘)

Although the pre-/post-questionnaire comparison did not reveal signs of development in the PSTs’ metapragmatic awareness, it was possible to notice some hints of increasing awareness regarding language-specific features of email formal writing by isolating certain metapragmatic comments in the responses to the post-questionnaire items that encouraged reflections on the telecollaborative DDL experience, as well as in materials generated during the video calls within the telecollaboration module. The features identified mainly concern the opening, specifically certain elements of the salutation, and the closing of the email. Some examples are provided in (6–10).

(6) Le formulazioni “Spettabile” e “in fede” vengono usate più raramente riguardo alla corrispondenza tra uno studente e il professore secondo noi. Ci sembrano più termini usati in ambito giuridico. (‘The expressions “Spettabile” and “in fede” are used less frequently in student-professor correspondence, according to our perception. They appear to be terms more commonly used in a legal context.’ Ens_Par, written outcome from videocall 2) (7) In Italia il titolo “dottore” \`e per tutti quelli che si sono laureati; “professore” \`e un titolo più alto, riservato a chi insegna a livello accademico; invece, in Austria ogni insegnante nella scuola superiore \`e indirizzato con “professore” anche se non hanno questo titolo ufficialmente. “Dottore” potrebbe appare più alto per gli austriaci e quindi \`e anche stato usato tanto nelle mail L2. (‘In Italy, the title “dottore” is used for everyone who has graduated, while “professore” is a higher title reserved for those who teach at the ac ademic level. In Austria, on the other hand, every teacher in secondary school is addressed as “professore” even if they do not hold this title officially. “Dottore” might appear more prestigious to Austrians and, therefore, has also been used frequently in L2 emails.’ Ens_Par, written outcome from videocall 4)   
(8) Gli studenti L2 hanno preferito utilizzare l’appellativo “Signore” per il destinatario (che non \`e non molto corretto), anche se una gran parte degli studenti L2 ha comunque utilizzato le formule corrette “professore” o “dottore”. (‘L2 students have preferred to use the term “Signore’” for the recipient (which is not very correct), although a significant portion of L2 students has still used the correct forms “professore” or “dottore.”’ Hur_Anz, written outcome from videocall 4) (9) Ho imparato ad esempio che la chiusura di una mail formale \`e più una forma standard per gli italiani e non importa il contenuto della mail […] Di conseguenza, si deve sottolineare l’importanza di una chiusura del testo quando si insegna la mail formale agli alunni austriaci. (‘I have learned, for example, that the closing of a formal email is more of a standard form for Italians and is not necessarily tied to the content of the email. Consequently, the importance of a proper email closing should be emphasized when teaching formal email writing to Austrian students.’ Post-questionnaire)   
(10) Non sapevo che si usa “in fede” quando non si sa la destinatario. (‘I didn’t know that “in fede” is used when you don’t know the recipient.’ Post-questionnaire)

It is interesting to note that the comment mentioned in (10) refers to a non-existent norm in the target language. Given that there were no examples of in fede used by L1 speakers in the corpus data used for the module, this is a case where interaction with Italian peers has led the PSTs to acquire incorrect information. A similar case is with buongiorno (‘good morning’) as an opening greeting, for which one of the PSTs declared that they learned that Buongiorno \`e un saluto formale e molto usato che io pensavo che fosse inadeguato (‘Buongiorno is a formal and widely used greeting, contrary to my previous belief that it was inappropriate’). In fact, buongiorno as an opening greeting in a formal email represents a relatively recent innovation, modeled after introductory address forms more frequently found in spoken communication (Andorno, 2015, p. 10). Its appropriateness still depends greatly on the individual recipient’s perception.

# 5.3. PSTs’ reflections on formal email teaching (RQ2a)

The examination of the responses to the post-questionnaire items provided insights into the perspectives of the PSTs regarding formal email teaching and lesson planning. The analysis with inductive category formation identified 8 categories in the data, distributed as shown in Table 1.

PSTs emphasized the importance of using authentic materials and applying the principles of action-oriented and task-based teaching, as exemplified in (11) and (12).

(11) Inoltre, dovrebbero essere mostrati esempi autentici. (‘Furthermore, authentic examples should be shown.‘)   
(12) Durante la pianificazione del modulo didattico abbiamo sempre cercato di creare una connessione con la vita reale degli studenti per illustrare l’importanza del tema trattato. Oltre a ci\`o, secondo noi, \`e davvero opportuno includere dei task con dei information gap. (‘During the planning of the teaching module, we have consistently aimed to establish a connection with students’ real-life experiences to emphasize the importance of the topic being discussed. In addition to this, we believe it’s highly appropriate to include tasks with information gaps.‘)

They also stressed the importance of addressing the teaching of pragmatic aspects of the formal email in Italian L2 classes (13) and reflected on the role of cooperative work and certain computer tools, as reported in (14) and (15).

(13) Secondo me l’insegnamento della scrittura di mail formali in italiano \`e molto opportuna in una classe austriaca (‘In my opinion, the teaching of formal email writing in Italian is very appropriate in an Austrian classroom.‘)   
(14) Ad esempio l’apprendimento cooperativo per quanto riguarda l’analisi e l’interpretazione delle mail formali. Grazie alle discussioni, potevamo chiarire dubbi e supposizioni false riguardo alla scrittura di una mail formale. (‘For example, cooperative learning in the context of analyzing and interpreting formal emails. Thanks to discussions, we could clarify doubts and incorrect assumptions regarding the writing of a formal email.‘)   
(15) Ho imparato a usare meglio le offerte di piattaforme che permettono una collaborazione in particolare online. (‘I have learned to better utilize the features of platforms that enable collaboration, especially online.‘)

# 5.4. Insights from the PSTs’ lesson plans (RQ2b)

The instructions for creating the teaching unit explicitly required basing it on the principles of task-based language teaching and using the data from the corpus of authentic emails that had been worked on during the telecollaborative module (see the assignment in the online appendix). The first instruction was mostly adhered to in the lesson plans produced, which have, as their central element, the completion of a task (writing a formal email, in the majority of cases) with a focus on form after the task.

As for the second aspect emphasized in the assignment, the corpus was used in the majority of the units produced, but in ways that do not reflect the DDL approach experienced during the collaborative module. In fact, the PSTs never proposed an activity for students to autonomously explore the corpus and discern more or less usual linguistic uses, that is, to identify predominant trends and, consequently, to inductively reconstruct data-based usage norms. In the activities they proposed, the teacher is invited to extract from the corpus some models, whether positive or negative, as reported in examples (16)–(18) from the lesson plans. In some cases, it was suggested to make students compare L1 and L2, as in (16), or formal and informal emails, as in (18), in order to clarify the characteristics of an appropriate formal email in the target language. Sometimes, teachers are invited to also refer to normative sources such as manuals or websites.

(16) Tramite l’uso di input autentico l’insegnante presenta sulla LIM esempi di mail scritte da parlanti L1 e L2 (‘Through the use of authentic input, the teacher presents examples of emails written by L1 and L2 speakers on the interactive whiteboard.‘)   
(17) L’insegnante da \` tempo agli studenti di leggere le fotocopie, rispondere alle domande di comprensione e fare domande su passaggi poco chiari; (+l’insegnante ha modificato una dei tre mail per dare un esempio “bad practice”). (‘The teacher gives students time to read the photocopies, answer comprehension questions, and ask questions about unclear passages (the teacher has modified one of the three emails to provide an example of bad practice).‘)

Table 1 Distribution of the aspects referred to when reflecting on teaching perspectives.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category Name</td><td>N</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Authentic input</td><td>6</td><td>27.27</td></tr><tr><td>Action-oriented approach/TBLT</td><td>4</td><td>18.18</td></tr><tr><td> Importance of teaching formal email</td><td>3</td><td>13.64</td></tr><tr><td>Learners&#x27; autonomy</td><td>2</td><td>9.09</td></tr><tr><td>Chunks and formulas</td><td>2</td><td>9.09</td></tr><tr><td>Cooperative learning</td><td>2</td><td>9.09</td></tr><tr><td>Technologies</td><td>2</td><td>9.09</td></tr><tr><td>Interaction</td><td>1</td><td>4.55</td></tr><tr><td>TOT</td><td>22</td><td>100.00</td></tr></table></body></html>

(18) L’insegnante presenta degli esempi di mail formali e informali. (‘The teacher presents examples of formal and informal emails.‘)

The observation of the lesson plans matches with what emerged from the PSTs’ reflections on teaching formal email writing (see Section 5.3). The PSTs structured their lessons according to an action-oriented approach and incorporated authentic materials, as instructed. However, they did not integrate the DDL approach experienced during the telecollaborative module into their teaching strategies. Essentially, while they understood the significance of an action-oriented approach using authentic materials for pragmatic instruction, they did not seem to grasp the importance of prompting students to explore corpora to identify pragmatic aspects of language use.

# 5.5. Discussion

The first research question (RQ1) aimed to investigate whether the pragmatic (RQ1a) and metapragmatic (RQ1b) awareness of PSTs of Italian in Austrian Tyrol evolved during a 4-week telecollaborative DDL module focused on writing formal emails.

The quantitative analysis conducted to evaluate the participants’ ability to assess the appropriateness of specific elements of formal emails (RQ1a) showed improvement after the module. Despite the PSTs already showcasing a strong command of the pragmalinguistic tools necessary for producing formal emails appropriately even before the module, it seems that the intervention has further enhanced their ability to identify suitable pragmatic choices. This enhancement is particularly noticeable in the leave-taking formulas, aligning with learners’ emphasis on formal and formulaic conventions, as highlighted by Economidou-Kogetsidis (2023).

However, there was no notable enhancement in the ability to recognize pragmatic infelicities. This disparity can likely be attributed to the fact that participants could easily judge as appropriate the expressions they consistently found in the corpus, but struggled to identify what is deemed inappropriate. Indeed, detecting evidence of what is not acceptable (or not appropriate, in the case of pragmatics) in the target language is challenging for learners unless made explicit, e.g. by “a teacher drawing students’ attention to the problem” (Long, 2015, p. 26). In our virtual exchange, feedback was expected from the telecollaboration partners, but it may not have been sufficient to inform the PSTs on which linguistic usages were considered inappropriate in the specific context under consideration.

Furthermore, the intervention from the L1-speaking partners may have even misled the PSTs. Indeed, our findings show indications of inappropriate input from the Italian participants in some qualitative descriptions (cf. The discussion about the closing formula in fede and the opening salutation buongiorno in Section 5.3), thus confirming that intuitions of native speakers may not accurately represent the realization of speech acts (Glaser, 2014). It is recognized that even native-speaking teachers may face challenges in teaching pragmatics due to the potential for inaccuracies or difficulties stemming from their idiosyncratic, anecdotal, or otherwise limited understanding of certain pragmatic uses in their L1 (Cohen, 2016; Szczepaniak-Kozak & Wasikiewicz-Firlej, 2018).

These observations appear to substantiate the idea that pragmatic learning in telecollaborative contexts could benefit from a parallel focused intervention, as emphasized by scholars such as Belz and Vyatkina (2005; 2008), Cunningham (2016), and Vyatkina (2007). A more targeted activity, as proposed, for instance, by Chen (2015) and Nguyen et al. (2015), may prove more effective in helping learners identify pragmatic infelicities.

Additionally, there may be a certain degree of experimental bias at play. Participants might have reduced the accuracy of their responses in the post-questionnaire due to a decreased engagement with the task, which was somewhat repetitive and administered at a short distance. This could explain why some infelicities that had been recognized in the pre-questionnaire went under-noticed in the post-questionnaire. An indication of this potential reduction in engagement is evident in the fact that the open-ended responses in the post-questionnaire tended to be more concise.

The qualitative analysis, which aimed at investigating the PSTs’ ability to consciously reflect on the underlying reasons behind form-function-context mapping mechanisms (RQ1b), showed a largely unchanged picture between the pre- and post-questionnaires. The decision to center the DDL module on formal email writing stemmed from the widespread recognition of difficulties in this area, both in L2 and even in L1, as documented in the literature (e.g., Andorno, 2015; Biesenbach-Lucas, 2006, 2007; Econo midou-Kogetsidis, 2011, 2023; Konuk, 2021; Savi´c, 2018). However, the PSTs demonstrated a strong capacity for metapragmatic reflection on the target components of formal emails even in the pre-questionnaire, with limited potential for enhancement.

The second research question of the study (RQ2) aimed to understand how the DDL telecollaborative experience influenced the participants’ perspectives on teaching the pragmatics of writing formal emails. A qualitative analysis of the relevant items in the postquestionnaire (RQ2a) indicated that the module led the PSTs to emphasize the significance of using authentic materials and adopting an action-oriented approach when teaching formal email writing in the classroom. We can therefore hypothesize that the telecollaborative module has raised greater awareness of the role of corpora or authentic data sources in the teaching of pragmatic aspects of the target language. However, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these views on teaching and lesson planning were stimulated by the module, as we lack a comparison with their opinions prior to the experience.

The analysis of the lesson plans developed by the PSTs together with their Italian partners (RQ2b) confirmed what emerged from their reflections, showing that the strategies considered most appropriate by the PSTs to teach the pragmatics of formal email writing to their future students include the use of a task-based approach and authentic materials as input. However, the didactic use of corpora according to a DDL approach was not chosen as a strategy to employ with their students. The PSTs demonstrated a preference for presenting a secure norm reference to the class (examples and “rules” on language manuals or websites, good and bad models selected by the teacher), rather than suggesting the possibility of exploring a corpus to investigate more and less frequent linguistic uses, as well as prevalent trend lines. The telecollaborative module’s design aimed, among other things, to convey the idea of learning based on research and autonomous, or only partially guided, knowledge construction (Boulton, 2017). It does not appear that the PSTs have fully embraced and internalized this pedagogical perspective. Therefore, the experiential learning episode provided by the DDL approach proposed in the telecollaborative module was not completely successful in enabling pedagogical choices based on individual research encounters and potentially shaping participants’ future teaching (Boulton & Tyne, 2014). The discrepancy between the success of the intervention in addressing issues of pragmatic awareness and knowledge, but not pedagogical practice, confirms a trend in instructional pragmatics: the difficulty of teachers in transferring their pragmatic knowledge to the classroom (Chavez de Castro, 2005; Ekin & Damar, 2013).

# 6. Conclusion

This study intended to determine whether a DDL approach in a telecollaborative setting could effectively support the preparation of non-native preservice teachers (PSTs) of Italian as an L2 in recognizing and teaching appropriate opening, requesting, and closing formulas in formal emails. The findings revealed that the telecollaborative DDL module impacted the pragmatic and the metapragmatic awareness, and also influenced the teaching skills related to formal email writing in Italian, among Tyrolean PSTs. Our participants demonstrated an improved ability to identify appropriate pragmatic choices, particularly in leave-taking formulas, and exhibited increased awareness of the importance of using authentic materials in teaching pragmatics.

These findings address a critical yet underexplored area in the literature—namely, the development of strategies to enhance pragmatic instruction for non-native PSTs. Telecollaboration, a rapidly evolving educational environment (Sadler & Dooly, 2022), has been identified as an effective tool that aligns with the objectives of teacher education curricula, particularly in fostering a range of teaching competencies (Hauck et al., 2020). The integration of telecollaboration with data-driven learning presents a synergistic model, combining the strengths of an inductive, data-informed process with the added benefit of expert-guided feedback.

However, the difficulty in identifying inappropriate pragmatic choices, coupled with an overreliance on the competence of native peers, limited the improvements in learning outcomes. This indicates that while telecollaboration and DDL provide significant ad vantages in promoting learner autonomy and collaborative problem-solving, additional measures are necessary to ensure the reliability and validity of the data utilized by both native and non-native speakers. These measures could include minimizing the reliance on subjective native speaker evaluations and integrating scaffolding through instructor feedback, in-person sessions, or software for corpus-based data analysis. Such interventions are expected to refine the accuracy of the students’ conducted research in the DDL module and enrich corpus data utilization in future telecollaborative projects. Moreover, educators training PSTs should more explicitly promote meta-pedagogical reflection on employing DDL approaches with prospective students.

The study’s conclusions must be viewed in light of three significant limitations. The small sample size and lack of a control group restrict the generalizability of our findings. This is due to the difficulty to find large groups of PSTs of Italian, an inherent disadvantage when dealing with less widely learned languages. Additionally, we established a baseline from experts’ judgments, which actually exhibited considerable variance—an aspect we overlooked for simplicity. This simplification potentially compromises the precise measurement of the DDL module’s effects on pragmatic awareness. Lastly, the teaching skills data, derived from lesson plans cocreated during the PSTs’ telecollaboration with Italian partners, reflect a collective rather than individual perspective, limiting the attribution of these skills solely to PSTs.

We believe that this study opens up future perspectives for the implementation of DDL telecollaborative programs as a valuable supplement to traditional teaching methods within teacher training. Further research might enhance the measurement of this kind of intervention’s role in the development of (meta)pragmatic awareness by focusing on aspects less known to learners, such as discourse markers (De Cristofaro & Badan, 2021; Nuzzo & Brocca, forthcoming), and areas where L1 and L2 diverge, such as the use of modal particles (Cardinaletti, 2011).
