# Abstract

The present study is based on interviews with 48 students and 27 instructors in a North American university and explores whether students and professors across faculties share the same views on the use of paraphrased, summarized, and translated texts in four examples of L2 student writing. Participants’ comments centered on whether the paraphrases contained too much copying and could be further paraphrased to incorporate one’s own thinking, whether a citation was necessary for background information summarized in an introduction of the paper, and whether the translated text should be acknowledged to indicate either paraphrasing or copying of others’ words. The relevant comments highlight disciplinary differences rather than differences between students and instructors, though the latter were more able to demonstrate further paraphrasing to incorporate one’s own thinking. The study illustrates that students have difficulties in understanding how to paraphrase in order to avoid plagiarism because such apparently straightforward academic literacy skills as paraphrasing or summarizing are in fact complex and depend on one’s knowledge of the content, the disciplinary nature of citation practices, and the rhetorical purposes of using citations in a specific context of disciplinary writing.

# Introduction

There is some consensus among researchers that inappropriate textual borrowing in L2 student writing should be viewed as a learning or developmental issue rather than an ill-intentioned illustration of plagiarism because of their limited L2 language proficiency (e.g., Johns & Mayes, 1990; Keck, 2006); unfamiliarity with the Western concept of plagiarism (e.g., Pennycook, 1994, 1996; Shi, 2006); and uncertainty about the expected target discourse conventions (e.g., Abasi & Graves, 2008; Ange´lil-Carter, 2000; Petric´, 2004). The underlying assumption is that there are standard or fixed rules about how to use source texts. To explore whether or how students and professors across disciplines understand or apply certain criteria when commenting on specific examples of student writing, the present study is based on interview comments of 48 students and 27 instructors or professors on four examples of how some L2 undergraduates paraphrased, summarized, or translated source texts.

# Literature review

Corresponding to the present data generated from examples of students’ paraphrased, summarized, and translated texts from source materials when writing for different disciplinary courses, the following literature review focuses on

paraphrasing and inferential thinking, good versus bad paraphrasing, paraphrasing as an important skill in summarizing and translating, and disciplinary differences in citation practices.

# Paraphrasing and inferential thinking

An important process of rewriting source texts is paraphrasing or restating a source text in one’s own words with a credit to the original author. Commenting on the art of paraphrasing, D’Angelo (1979) posits that the writer should ‘‘recast the passage into a freely formed version of the original’’ while preserving the essential meaning (p. 256). To address the question of how substantially the original wording should be modified to avoid plagiarism, Keck (2006) defines substantial paraphrases as containing only general words related to the topic and that appear repeatedly in the source text, and Roig (1999) defines superficial paraphrasing as minor modifications (word substitutions/deletions or rearrangement of sentence structures) containing an appropriation of five consecutive words or more from the source text. Most of the superficial paraphrases in student writing, as Keck (2010) has noted, are based on a deletion/ addition/substitution strategy to replace words with synonyms, add additional words, or delete words in the borrowed string. Although superficial modifications, also called patchwriting (Howard, 1995), might constitute inappropriate textual borrowing even with an acknowledgment of the source, many L2 students take the risk of superficial paraphrasing because of a lack of confidence in rephrasing source texts in their own words (e.g., Abasi & Akbari, 2008).

Substantial modification of the original text with a credit to the original author, however, does not seem enough to make a good paraphrase. Based on her analyses of the exemplary paraphrases on some North American college websites on plagiarism, Yamada (2003) has noted that good paraphrasing actually involves inferential thinking, either deductive (making a conclusion based on statements or premises) or analogical (noticing similarities between two domains). The idea of restating the original text to combine source information with one’s own thinking, as Yamada (2003) points out, contradicts how students are instructed to paraphrase and present a faithful account of the source text, and signals the mastery of good paraphrasing and academic literacy that distinguish experienced writers from novice writers. In the same vein, Keck (2010) has observed that substantial paraphrases in student writing are achieved not only by transforming the major components in original excerpt (subject, verb, and object) into different grammatical forms to express the same idea (clause element revision) but also by adding a phrase or clause to convey ideas that are not explicitly mentioned in the original text (clause element creation). However, apart from Yamada and Keck, there has been little effort to clarify how incorporating one’s point of view into a paraphrase is accomplished.

# Good versus bad paraphrasing

To explore how students and instructors distinguish between good and bad paraphrasing, several researchers have asked university students and instructors to paraphrase a given text (Chandrasegaran, 2000; Roig, 1999, 2001) and/or compare the original texts and various rewritten versions which were paraphrased by the researchers to various degrees (e.g., minimally, moderately, and sufficiently) with or without citations (Chandrasegaran, 2000; Deckert, 1993; Hale, 1987; McCormick, 1989; Pennycook, 1994; Roig, 1997, 2001). Many participants, in either L1 (Hale, 1987; McCormick, 1989; Roig, 1997, 1999, 2001) or L2 contexts (Chandrasegaran, 2000; Deckert, 1993; Pennycook, 1994), showed disagreement as to which paraphrased versions had been plagiarized. For example, many students made a judgment based on the presence or absence of the citation and believed that it was acceptable to copy long strings of words from a source text as long as the original author received credit (Roig, 1997). Some professors also produced paraphrases that contained strings of words copied from source texts (Roig, 2001). The fact that teachers had problems identifying incorrect paraphrasing led to the concern of whether what constituted plagiarism had been clearly defined (Pennycook, 1994). Some scholars also highlight culture as an important factor and regard copying in L2 writing as a resistance to the Western notion of textual plagiarism (e.g., Chandrasoma, Thompson, & Pennycook, 2004; Pennycook, 1996). The question is: How much copying is too much? Explaining why teachers and students might disagree on the appropriateness of textual borrowing, Pecorari (2008) states, ‘‘the problem may not be that one group has a mistaken perception, but that two groups have different perceptions’’ (p. 10). The implication is that students are likely to be confused if their understanding of good paraphrasing is different from that of their professors.

# Paraphrasing as an important skill in summarizing and translating

The idea that paraphrasing goes beyond faithful reporting to personal interpretation of the source text highlights the role of paraphrasing in two other rewriting processes: summarizing source information and translating a source text from another language. Like paraphrasing, both translating and summarizing require the writer not to copy the original text, with the former focusing on rewriting single sentences and the latter on condensing sentences and paragraphs to get to the gist. Just as one needs to mix in one’s own interpretation in paraphrasing, one needs to explore meaning potential in summarizing (Hood, 2008). Similar to paraphrasing, translating ranges from accuracy (e.g., word for word or faithful translation) to fluency (e.g., semantic or free translation) (Newmark, 1988). The latter highlights the fact that the translator, being situated between the reader of the target language and the writer of the source language, needs to first interpret the meaning of the original text and then restate the meaning in the target language. Since a text might be interpreted in different ways, a translator forms his/her own voice in the translated text through how he/she interprets the original text. Like paraphrasing and summarizing, translating is a meaning making process. If paraphrasing and summarizing stretch the limited linguistic proficiency of L2 writers, the ability to translate source text from another language suggests extra linguistic resources that L2 writers can use in their writing.

Exploring students’ challenges in summarizing source texts, previous researchers have reported how students copied from the original text (e.g., Campbell, 1990; Keck, 2006; Shi, 2004), how they rarely included a summary of the source information in their writing (Howard, Serviss, & Rodrigue, 2010), or how they chose to only paraphrase or summarize two types of source texts: the early excerpt that defines the key concept and the concluding excerpt that restates the thesis (Keck, 2010). Since summary writing requires one’s own thinking in selecting, combining, and condensing information into its gist, it is important to explore how summarized texts should be acknowledged, especially when they are used to present background information.

In addition, research needs to examine the role of translation in using source texts. There is a tendency for scholars, especially English-speaking scholars, to neglect non-English materials because of the dominance of English in academic scholarship (Line, 1971). The relevantly fewer citations from non-English language sources correspond to a lack of attention on how L2 writers translate and cite sources in their writing. Although L2 writers have been observed to translate materials retrieved from L1 while writing an L2 text (e.g., Liu, 2004) and some have been suspected of plagiarism when translating texts from another language (Petric´, 2004), no attention has been paid to the challenges in translating and citing texts from another language as well as to the advantage of L2 writers being able to disseminate information across national or language boundaries by translating and citing text from their L1.

# Disciplinary differences in citation practices

The lack of understanding of and consensus on appropriate use of source texts accentuate disciplinary differences in citation practices. Hyland (1999) has pointed out that citation language or conventions are influenced by ‘‘the epistemological and social conventions of their disciplines’’ (p. 341). One major difference between science and humanities communities lies in how scholars acknowledge the difference between the originality of content and its wording or, as Bouville (2008) suggests, the difference between copying words and copying ideas. For example, people in humanities value the originality of wording because language and meaning are inseparable to them (Bazerman, 1994). In contrast, people in science tend to emphasize content rather than how it is worded as they rarely use direct quotations (e.g., Dubois, 1988) but often extract a string of words or phrases from sources and use them without acknowledgment (e.g., Dubois, 1988; St. John, 1987). Science students have also been reported to believe that it is OK to lift stretches of source texts, for example, to describe a similar research procedure used in their own study (e.g., Flowerdew & Li, 2007). These observations suggest that discipline writing means using the valued rhetoric and citation language accepted by the disciplinary community to argue and construct knowledge (Li, 2006; Young & Leinhardt, 1998). It is therefore important to investigate whether students understand how to use sources texts in a specific writing assignment and how professors across disciplines expect their students to use and cite paraphrased, summarized, and translated texts.

# The present study

Although scholars have suggested some underlying criteria about what constitutes good paraphrasing (Keck, 2006, 2010; Roig, 1999; Yamada, 2003), it is not clear whether and how students and professors across disciplines follow certain criteria when evaluating student writing as they have been reported to make different judgments on some paraphrased texts written by researchers (e.g., Deckert, 1993; Pennycook, 1994; Roig, 1997, 1999, 2001). Nor is it clear whether and how students should incorporate their own thinking into a paraphrase. In addition, since summarizing and translating also involve rewriting source texts with one’s own words and thinking, research needs to explore how summarized and translated texts in student writing should be acknowledged. In response to the above needs, the present study focuses on students’ and professors’ views on examples of students’ paraphrased, summarized, and translated texts to answer the following three research questions:

1. How do participating students and faculty across disciplines view the examples of paraphrasing in relation to the amount of copying and the use of one’s own inferential thinking?   
2. How do participating students and faculty across disciplines view the example of the summarized text in terms of how it should be acknowledged?   
3. How do participating students and faculty across disciplines view the example of the translated text in terms of how it should be acknowledged?

# Methods

# Context and writing samples

Like many North American universities, the participating university has a website on plagiarism. Students are instructed to cite when summarizing and paraphrasing source texts in a compulsory first-year course on university writing. The present study is part of a larger study on students’ challenges in using source texts for which I first collected examples of students’ textual borrowing from 16 students’ research paper assignments for different disciplinary courses (Shi, 2010). Three of the 16 students were monolingual English speakers and the rest all spoke a language other than English at home. After completing a research paper for either their first-year courses (English writing $= 8$ , History $= 1$ , Film Studies $= 1$ , Biology $= 2$ ) or second- or third-year courses (Women’s Studies $= 1$ , Political Science $= 3$ ), the 16 students were asked to identify words and ideas in their writing that were borrowed from source texts and explain how and why the texts were appropriated. Together, the 16 students identified a total of 187 examples of textual borrowing, from which I then randomly selected 17 examples as interview items to solicit views from 48 students and 27 instructors. The purpose was to clarify disciplinary differences rather than to identify general criteria for citation practices. Each example was presented to the interviewees with (a) information about the source or the student writer’s description of the source; (b) the student-generated writing; and (c) the writer’s self report on how and why the source text was appropriated with or without a reference. Analyses of the interview data illustrate three interpretive grounds for textual borrowing: (a) the notion of common knowledge based on participants’ comments on 7 of the 17 examples (Shi, 2011); (b) the complexity of original expressions based on participants’ comments on 5 of the 17 examples (Shi, 2012); and (c) what constitutes good paraphrasing or rewriting, a focus of the present study, based on participants’ comments on 4 of the 17 examples. Table 1 illustrates the four examples rewritten, according to the original student writers, by paraphrasing, summarizing, or translating the source texts.

# Original student writers of the four examples

The four examples of appropriated texts analyzed in the present study were from research papers written by three L2 students who spoke a language other than English at home. The writer of the first two examples (Table 1, Paraphrase 1 about allergic reactions and Paraphrase 2 about side effects) was an 18-year-old freshman who immigrated from China with his parents at the age of 12. Having attended junior school and high school in North America, he belonged to ‘generation $1 . 5 '$ and experienced challenges as an L2 writer (CCCC Statement on Second Language Writing and Writers, 2001; Harklau, Losey, & Siegal, 1999). The two examples were from his research paper on a topic of his own choice submitted to a first-year English course. He said that he had chosen the topic on the potential danger of antibiotics because he had learned about the topic from his parents who were doctors. Like all other paraphrases the writer used in his paper, the two examples each contained a reference of the source. The writer explained that he provided the sources for all his paraphrased sentences in order to avoid plagiarism.

The other two writers were international students taking political science courses as part of a 1-year exchange program. Both were in their early 20s, the writer of the third example (Table 1, Summary of the Liberal Democratic Party) was from Japan and the writer of the fourth example (Table 1, Translation about Japanese economy) was from Korea. The Japanese student wrote a paper titled ‘Domination of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japanese politics,’ a topic assigned by the instructor for a third-year political science course. The student writer tried, as she explained in the previous study, to summarize what she read from multiple sources about the dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party and used it without a reference in the introduction of the paper. However, she was not sure whether it was necessary to cite multiple sources in her context and if so, how. In comparison, the Korean student wrote a paper titled ‘Japanese economic miracle: Industrial policies of government,’ one of the five topics provided by the instructor for a second-year political science course. The student writer explained in the previous study that she relied on L1 books and used many pieces of translated texts with no references throughout the paper. The translation example (Table 1) was one of the many translated texts she used in that paper.

To provide the context of the examples, I informed the present interviewees about the backgrounds of the student writers and the writing assignments. Since paraphrasing, summarizing, and translating are meaning making processes that are context-specific (Mishler, 1979), I also kept the original papers handy for interviewees who wanted to check the rhetorical context of the examples. The student writers of the four examples are referred to as original student writers in this paper to distinguish them from student interviewees who participated in the present study.

# Interviewees

A total of 48 interviewees (20 undergraduates, 28 graduates) and 27 instructors (21 faculty members, 5 sessional instructors, 1 librarian) in a North American university responded to an advertisement for the study and volunteered to participate in the interviews (Table 2). A large percentage (29, $60 \%$ ) of the participating student interviewees spoke a language other than English at home while most instructors were native-English speakers. About $65 \%$ (49) of the interviewees were in arts and social sciences and the rest (26, $3 5 \%$ ) were in science and applied sciences. Each interviewee was assigned a pseudonym. The first letter of pseudonyms for instructors indicates faculty or institution $( \mathbf { A } = \mathbf { A r t s }$ , ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { S } } } =$ Science, $\mathbf { N } =$ Nursing, $\mathrm { E = }$ Education, $\mathrm { L } =$ English Language Institute). For example, Anita is a professor from the Arts Faculty. Similarly, the first letter of pseudonyms for students also indicates discipline $\mathbf { A } =$ arts/social sciences, $\mathbf { S } =$ science/applied sciences) but these names are followed by a letter in brackets indicating the person’s status as a graduate student (G), or an undergraduate (U). For example, Amanda (U) is an undergraduate majoring in arts/social sciences.

# Coding of interview comments

To answer the three research questions, a coding scheme was developed to distinguish the interviewees’ citation judgments as well as how they explained these decisions. A research assistant and I coded $10 \%$ of the data separately and we reached an agreement of $8 5 \%$ . The differences were resolved by merging some of the categories. The final coding scheme contained four types of citation decisions that the interviewees thought the examples should have followed (cite, quote, not to cite, not sure) and five categories of comments illustrating how interviewees supported their decisions, including (1) the nature or quality of the phrased, translated, and summarized texts, (2) a consideration of whether the examples could be cases of plagiarism or misconduct, (3) the learning and teaching of how to cite, (4) interviewees’ similar experiences with those of the writers, and (5) suggestions about how to improve the citation practices in the examples. (See Appendix A for the coding scheme and sample comments.) Using the coding scheme, I identified a total of 300 citation decisions (75 participants commenting on 4 examples) and 467 types of comments supporting the decisions. Over half of these comments focused on the nature and quality of appropriated texts (241, $52 \%$ ), followed by general comments on learning and teaching (98, $2 1 \%$ ), suggestions to improve the specific examples (84, $1 8 \%$ ), views on plagiarism or misconduct related to the specific cases $( 2 4 , 5 \% )$ , and similar experiences of the interviewees $( 2 0 , 4 \% )$ . The small number of comments on plagiarism $( 2 4 , 5 \% )$ suggests that many participants avoided making general comments about the issue.

# Findings and discussion

Participants’ comments were first compared in terms of whether the appropriated texts in the four examples should be acknowledged by using citations or quotations (Fig. 1). Although the majority of interviewees believed that the sources of all examples should be acknowledged, a good number of them believed that the two paraphrases should be presented in quotations (35, $47 \%$ for Paraphrase 1 on allergic reactions and 23, $31 \%$ for Paraphrase 2 on side effects) and that the source of the translated text (Japanese economy) did not need to be cited (27, $3 6 \%$ ). These tendencies led to the following analyses of participants’ views on the use of source texts in each example. The relevant comments on learning and teaching challenges related to each example will also be discussed.

How do participating students and faculty across disciplines view the examples of paraphrasing in relation to the amount of copying and the use of one’s own inferential thinking?

Most of the words in the student-generated texts in the two examples of paraphrasing (Paraphrases 1 and 2) were identical to those in the original texts (24 out of 33 words or $73 \%$ , and 34 out of 50 words or $68 \%$ respectively). Many participants noted that, compared to Paraphrase 2 (side effects) which contained many technical terms (e.g., streptomycin, side effects, hypersensitive reactions, renal and kidney damage, cranial nerve, dihydrostreptomycin, and auditory nerve) that were hard to replace, Paraphrase 1 (allergic reactions) contained not only long strings of words lifted from the source texts but also minor changes as the writer just switched words around and substituted ‘‘used to’’ with ‘‘in the past’’ and ‘‘mainly’’ with ‘‘primarily’’. Such superficial paraphrasing, as Keck (2010) points out, is a common strategy used by students. Participants’ comments highlight some disciplinary differences in whether there was too much copying in Paraphrase 1 and also illustrate, mostly based on comments of instructors, how further paraphrasing can be accomplished using one’s extra content knowledge or inferential thinking.

First of all, participants’ comments on the use of quotations reveal a disciplinary pattern in citation practices. Several interviewees in science/applied sciences explained that a citation was sufficient in both examples of paraphrases, because they would focus on whether the content rather than the exact wording was acknowledged (2 undergraduates, 9 graduates, 3 instructors). Three science professors (Sam, Scott, and Simon) said that the overlapping of words in Paraphrase 1 (allergic reactions) did not bother them. As Sam explained, ‘‘It doesn’t matter to me whether the person changed someone’s words or not. The idea is important, not the words.’’ Sara (G), a graduate student in science, also recalled from her reading of science papers that it was common for authors to use the same words from source text but did not put them in quotations. These comments echo those of the doctoral science students in Flowerdew and Li (2007) about the legitimacy of copying sentences as long as the source is acknowledged.

Fig. 1. Frequencies of the citation judgments.

In contrast, many students and professors in arts/social sciences believed that although the technical terms in Paraphrase 1 (allergic reactions) might not need acknowledgment, the borrowed text in Paraphrase 1 should be in quotes because it was too close to the original (7 undergraduates, 8 graduates, 13 instructors). ‘‘He lifted quite a bit of text so stick quotes around it,’’ said Amy. Angel, Edwards, Elmer, and Leo believed that it had too many of the exact words from the source to be counted as a true paraphrase. ‘‘That’s not really paraphrasing. That’s just choosing a different word,’’ said Leo. Two other instructors, Alma and Louisa, argued that the example came close to plagiarism even with a reference. Similarly, Emma stressed the need for a quotation when taking more than three words from the source and said:

(1) Particularly this part ‘‘more and more often. . .’’ should be in quotations. . . . the part ‘‘5–10 percent . . .’’ is a quote as well. . . . This string here where they got more than three words should be in quotation marks. (Interview with Emma).

The disciplinary differences expressed by the participants confirm previous observations on how the science community and the community of humanities differ in their focus on the originality of the content/idea or its wording (e.g., Bouville, 2008). Together with previous research, the present study suggests that understanding how to cite involves learning what counts as a new text or knowledge in a specific discipline.

Apart from commenting on the use of quotations, participants also expressed their views about whether and how Paraphrases 1 and 2 can be further paraphrased. There was an uncertainty about whether medical texts such as Paraphrase 2 (side effects) could be paraphrased beyond a certain point. Compared with students, especially the undergraduates, who said that they had no idea about how to make the paraphrases in the two examples better, several instructors pointed out that both examples could be further paraphrased. As a professor, Angel said she would prefer further paraphrasing because it would give her a chance ‘‘to understand what students were thinking and how much of what they took out they understood.’’ She would ask the writer of Paraphrase 2 questions such as, ‘‘Do you really understand that it’s this particular cranial nerve that is where balance resides? Why does it disturb balance? Is it that it affects the cranial nerve?’’ These questions indicate how inferential thinking should or could be incorporated in paraphrasing. Compared with Angel who believed that paraphrasing demonstrated reading comprehension, several other instructors or graduates argued that good paraphrasing was about making something readable for readers (e.g., Aileen (G), Ester, Steven). One should not, as Aileen (G) put it, ‘‘regurgitate the quotes but amalgamate or synthesize them.’’ To illustrate how Paraphrase 2 might be paraphrased better, Nancy and Adam (G) made the following suggestions.

The paraphrases suggested by Nancy and Adam (G) shown in Table 3 were indeed less close to the original text. For example, in both the original source and student text, damages of the kidney, liver and the cranial nerve were listed together with hypersensitivity as a direct damage from streptomycin. In comparison, Nancy, a professor in Nursing, was able to reshuffle the source sentence by indicating that the use of streptomycin would first cause hypersensitivity which would then damage the kidney, liver and the 8th cranial nerve. This illustrates the important role of content knowledge and, as both Yamada (2003) and Keck (2010) have noted, inferential thinking in paraphrasing. It also indicates the importance of the context of disciplinary writing. The Nursing professor was clearly able to paraphrase the source text further to demonstrate more expert knowledge.

Words identical in the original and paraphrased texts are highlighted.

In addition to the suggestion of using extra content in further paraphrasing, some participants in arts/social sciences also indicated that the student writer could incorporate his own stance or voice by using reporting verbs in phrases such as ‘‘as McKenna believes’’ or ‘‘Harris highlights the following’’ (e.g., Aaron (U), Ally (U), Alice (G), Arthur, Alma, Allen, Ester). Using such an integral citation (Swales, 1990) with reporting verbs like ‘‘believe’’ and ‘‘highlight’’ and the name of the source author as syntactic elements in the citing sentence, as these participants pointed out, would also solve the problem in determining where exactly McKenna’s or Harris’ ideas began since there were two sentences in each example. These suggestions resonate with Hyland’s (2009) call to improve bounding and documenting references in student writing as well as the need to understand the ‘‘rhetorical effects that formal choices have on the text’’ (Pecorari, 2008, p. 49). Acknowledging the rhetorical purposes of using citations in a specific disciplinary writing context, Scott, a science professor, called the issue of how to cite a stylistic debate and said the student’s practice in the two examples was not a problem from a science point of view.

The participants’ comments and their examples of good paraphrasing suggest that the L2 writer obviously had trouble paraphrasing. First of all, several participants pointed out that the student writer may not have understood the original texts (Agatha (G), Alice (G), Angel, Lily). Lily believed that one needed to be a native speaker to paraphrase it well and called the two examples of student paraphrasing a ‘‘noble attempt’’ that did not work. Some interviewees noted that the writer’s language problem had affected the original meaning as he replaced ‘‘the auditory part of the nerve’’ with ‘‘auditory nerve’’ (e.g., Ella), and ‘‘developed allergic reaction to antibiotics’’ with ‘‘are allergic to antibiotics’’ (e.g., Adam (G)). ‘‘Everything that is not a language problem is copied,’’ as Lily noted. Being aware of the linguistic challenges, Allen said that he would be ‘‘a little more flexible with L2 students who were struggling with the language.’’ Several L2 student interviewees also expressed sympathy with the writer because they had similar experiences when trying to paraphrase words that they did not really know the exact meaning (e.g., Amanda (U), Amelia (U), Audrey (U), Stephanie (U), Adrienne (G), Sara (G)). The following was a typical comment from Sara (G):

(2) I totally understand this situation because I have this kind of feeling when I write my report. It’s really hard. You have to understand the source and try to think how to explain it by your own sentence and by the very efficient and very brief way. It’s difficult for L2 writers but you have to do it. You can’t totally copy. (Interview with Sara (G))

Together, the participants’ comments on Paraphrases 1 and 2 suggest that good paraphrasing means balancing between a rigorous use of citations and a readable text with an integration of others’ words and ideas with those of one’s own. However, such general criteria can be interpreted differently based on (a) disciplinary differences in acknowledging wording versus content, (b) different levels of expert knowledge and inferential thinking expected by content professors, and (c) individual understandings of the rhetorical effects of using citations in a specific disciplinary context. The fact that many student interviewees were unable to further paraphrase the two examples suggests that it is a daunting task for students to paraphrase well. Depending on their knowledge base in both language and content, individual students, especially L2 students, may have trouble understanding what accuracy means and how much room there is for interpreting the source content.

How do participating students and faculty across disciplines view the example of the summarized text in terms of how it should be acknowledged?

The student-generated text in the summary example (Table 1) was part of the introduction of the paper where the writer summarized information about the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan from multiple source materials for which she did not provide references. According to Howard et al. (2010), such a summary of sources is rare in student writing and should be encouraged. Commenting on the summarized text, most of the interviewees focused on whether a citation was necessary with the majority favoring an acknowledgment of the sources (45, $60 \%$ vs. 27, $36 \%$ , Fig. 1). Since the source texts were not available, the interviewees, based on the writer’s comment, voiced their opinions on whether it was acceptable to present a summary statement without references in the introduction. The different views generated by the summary example highlight the rhetorical purposes of using citation for genre- or discipline-specific writing.

A number of participants said that it was acceptable to not cite the summarized information in the introduction because the rest of the paper could examine the different bits separately with acknowledgment (e.g., Angela (U), Stephanie (U), Adela (G), Aileen (G), Angel, Scott). Adela (G) assumed ‘‘that all this will be talked about later on.’’ Compared with students, instructors expressed their views more elaborately. For example, Alma, a professor in political science, said citations were rare in an introduction and, like some other participants, would only expect the student to use citations later on the issues. In her words:

(3) An introduction is actually somewhat unusual for citations in that much of this may be clear later in the paper. It’s actually not a citation issue. . . . The student needs to discuss what those debates are. . . . (Interview with Alma)

Arguing in the same line, a number of participants believed that the summary example contained information summarized in the writer’s own words and with her own understanding (4 undergraduates, 9 graduates, 6 instructors). For example, Louisa said one had to accept the fact that the writer was synthesizing what she read. The writer, as Louisa emphasized, ‘‘was not copying the words.’’

In contrast, several participants (Aric (G), Laura, Nancy, Simon) commented on how important it was to cite the sources when introducing ideas in the introduction of the paper. Aric (G) said there was no excuse for not using citations in the introduction though one might get away with it in an abstract. Two instructors, Nancy and Laura, said that the example illustrated the danger of teaching rules like ‘‘no citation was needed for a summary statement in the introduction.’’ They believed that such a rule was not valid because it needed to be interpreted in a specific context. Nancy said it would be only OK if one summarized studies without citations after one had reviewed them one by one. Similarly, Simon believed that the introduction actually should have the highest citation rate. As he explained:

(4) The introduction is where you introduce big ideas so citation is even more important. As the paper evolves, your citation frequency drops. . . . The reason for that is early in your research paper, you cite the context, you say what other people thought, then you move on to your own ideas. (Interview with Simon)

Many interviewees also believed that the fact that the information was pulled together from several authors warranted a citation itself (11 undergraduates, 12 graduates, 13 instructors). Since the topic had been debated among scholars, a number of participants said they would like to know who those scholars were. The following was a typical comment from Elmer:

(5) ‘‘Many scholars . . .’’ Who is that referring to? Who are the scholars? . . . We should encourage students to put down like who the scholars are, where the information is coming from . . . at least give a reference to the fact that somebody else had talked about. (Interview with Elmer)

The concern expressed by Elmer and other participants suggests that citation use in summary writing is closely related to the rhetorical purposes within the genre or discipline that students are learning. Viewed from such a perspective, several participants said they would not consider the summarized text as plagiarism but rather as a lack of understanding of using citations to build on knowledge in the introduction paragraph when writing for the disciplinary course (3 graduates, 4 instructors). Silva (U), an L2 student, expressed her uncertainty about how to cite because professors might have different standards. Silva (U) found that some professors would catch students copying a sentence without citing the source whereas others would not say anything even though students took sentences without citations. Silva (U) said she would always find out the expectations of the individual instructors. As she concluded, ‘‘I think it really depends who you are writing the paper for . . . I would ask the instructor because it is up to the instructors to give you the mark and you want a high mark.’’ Silva’s (U) comment suggests not only teaching challenges but also how students, especially L2 students, might develop their own learning strategies to deal with the complexity of citation practices across disciplinary contexts. Compared to their comments on Paraphrases 1 and 2, participants’ comments on the summary example further emphasize the extent to which judgments about what constitutes ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ citation and appropriation of other peoples’ words and ideas are context- and discipline-specific.

How do participating students and faculty across disciplines view the example of the translated text in terms of how it should be acknowledged?

According to the writer of the translated text (Table 1), this excerpt came from her first research paper at the participating university, and she had to rely on L1 books that she brought from her home university to cope with the content demand. However, as the example illustrated, she did not cite the sources as she translated and used these source texts. Commenting on the translated text about ‘‘the growth of Japanese economy in 1950–1977’’ and ‘‘its slowdown in 1978–1990,’’ many interviewees, students and instructors alike, argued that a citation was crucial for such a strongly factual and checkable statement (67, $89 \%$ , Fig. 1) because translating the source text did not make it one’s own (19 undergraduates, 21 graduates, 19 instructors). As Lily commented, ‘‘translation is not an excuse for not using a citation.’’ There should be, in Eve’s words, ‘‘a tip of the hat’’ to the original author since the writer obviously had not done firsthand research. Although the original source text was not given, several participants called the example of the translated text a case of plagiarism (2 undergraduates, 2 graduates, 2 instructors). As Adela (G) explained, ‘‘It’s plagiarizing because the student is rewriting and taking material that is not her own.’’ Another student (Amanda (U)) singled out the word ‘‘copy’’ from the writer’s self-reflection and said, ‘‘When I hear the word ‘copy,’ I think of plagiarism.’’

Arguing for the use of a citation, some students and instructors, however, voiced different views about the purpose of citing the source for the translated text: whether to acknowledge the original words or to credit others’ ideas. At issue was whether translating meant copying others’ words or paraphrasing others’ ideas. Sally (G) and Sandra (G) claimed that translation meant copying others’ words in a different language. Following the same argument, several participants (Adela (G), Adele (G), Sandra (G), Amy) believed that the translated text should actually be cited as a quote. Juxtaposed with the above was the belief that translating meant rewriting others’ ideas in one’s own words. For example, Aric (G) claimed that quoting was not necessary for a translated text which, by default, was a paraphrase in one’s own words. Other participants also stressed that translating was just changing the language or the medium of communication (e.g., Alan (U), Audrey (U), Sherrill (U), Sammy (G), Sara (G), Allen). As Sara (G) stated, ‘‘Translation is not the point, the point is others’ data and statistics.’’ Stressing the importance of citing ideas in science, Steven said, ‘‘In science, we are citing the substance no matter whether it is translated from another language or not.’’

The focus on content rather than translation expressed by Sara (G) and Steven suggests possible disciplinary differences between science and arts. In fact, The Chicago Manual of Style (Turabian, 2007), a citation manual for all disciplines and styles including science, contains no guidelines about how to cite a translated text. In contrast, a citation manual for arts/social science, MLA (Modern Language Association of America, 2009), provides information about how to cite and present a quotation in the original language and its translation:

If the quotation is run into the text, use double quotation marks around a translation placed in parentheses following the quotation but single quotation marks around a translation that immediately follows without intervening punctuation (p. 104).

The above guidelines suggest that the writer is advised to present the translation immediately following the quotation. If the translation is not done by the writer him or herself, the writer also needs to give the source of the translation in addition to the source of the quotation. These guidelines suggest that it is important to acknowledge ownership of words and ideas of both the original and translated texts in arts/social sciences. However, many participating students and instructors did not seem aware of these guidelines. If participants in science were not concerned about the details because The Chicago Manual of Style (Turabian, 2007) provides no relevant information, participants in arts/social sciences were not familiar with the guidelines perhaps because translated texts in student writing, like the example in the present study, were presented mostly without references so the problems had slipped the attention of the readers.

Apart from commenting on how the translated text should be acknowledged, several monolingual L1 interviewees said that they were impressed with the extra effort of the L2 writer to use source materials in another language (Adrienne (G), Alex, Edwards, Eric, Louisa). By not indicating that it was translated, Eric said that the student writer was ‘‘in a sense denying herself the credit.’’ Several L2 student interviewees also said the writer, whom they were proud of, should take the credit. These comments illustrate an awareness of the advantage of L2 writers over their L1 peers by being able to access extra resources in their L1. The access to more than one set of representational or cultural resources, as Doloughan (2004) puts it, ‘‘permits the production of texts that are ‘marked’ in salient and systematic ways’’ (p. 39). The present study suggests that L2 students should be encouraged to create text by using ideas or words from readings in their L1 and be guided to use appropriate method of attribution for the translated texts. By exploiting their L1 knowledge, L2 writers can become academic writers superior to monolingual L1 writers who, as Garfield and Welljams-Dorof (1990) point out, risk being ignorant of information reported in other languages.

# Summary and implications

Although the majority of participants believed that rewritten source texts in the four examples should be referenced, they had different views about why and how. The relevant comments reveal disciplinary differences rather than differences between students and instructors although the latter were more able to demonstrate further paraphrasing to incorporate one’s own thinking and extra content knowledge. Some participants in science, in contrast to their counterparts in arts/ social sciences who emphasized acknowledging others’ words, believed that content rather than wording needed to be acknowledged for both the paraphrased and translated texts. Participants across disciplines also expressed contrasting views on whether it was appropriate to present a summary of the background information in the introductory paragraph without a reference. This study, like the others in this issue, highlights the different beliefs and perceptions about citation practices. Specifically, students have difficulties understanding how to paraphrase to avoid plagiarism because such apparently straightforward academic literacy skills like paraphrasing or summarizing are in fact complex and depend on one’s knowledge of the content, the disciplinary nature of citation practices, and rhetorical purposes of using citations in a specific context of disciplinary writing. Understanding these issues, rather than knowing the general criteria for good paraphrasing (Keck, 2006, 2010; Roig, 1999; Yamada, 2003), is essential for students to acquire academic literacy.

The disciplinary differences in citation practices suggest the danger of following some general rules about citations that might not be valid in certain contexts. Participants’ comments on how many words can be borrowed in paraphrasing, whether quotations are essential to indicate words borrowed, and how one should accurately document summarized or translated source information across disciplines, suggest that students and instructors need to adopt an exploratory approach to negotiate the competing perspectives and practices when teaching and learning to write research papers for different disciplinary courses. Students and instructors should explore collaboratively, as Keck (2010, p. 195) put it, ‘‘when, how, and for what purposes’’ paraphrases should be integrated into one’s own writing. As the present data suggest, students, especially those in arts/social sciences, can be guided in using reporting verbs in integrated citations. Only through such practices and explorations can paraphrasing and intertextuality be made transparent and, therefore, teachable.

The study also highlights the role of inferential thinking in paraphrasing and rewriting source texts. The comparison of the paraphrases done by the student writer and the nursing professor illustrates how paraphrasing can go beyond restating the original information to express one’s own inferential thinking and demonstrate extra content knowledge. Participants’ concern over how the L2 writer did superficial paraphrasing because he might not have understood the original text suggest the importance of both linguistic and content knowledge in rewriting source texts. The study suggests that for subject specific texts, a content expert could be consulted to model how content knowledge and inferential thinking could be used to produce substantial paraphrasing.

The present study, however, is limited by the short excerpts of writing samples. Although the papers from which the examples were selected were available, no participants expressed an interest to read them during the interview perhaps because they found the interview situation not appropriate for extra time on reading. Since the majority of participants found the information about the writing assignments and the backgrounds of the writers helpful in their reading of the examples, it would be interesting to find out in future research whether contextualized examples in extended discourse would generate fewer differences among participants. In addition, the gap between the student-generated text and the paraphrased text produced by the interviewees also suggest future study to compare students’ paraphrased texts with those of professional writers. To examine how content knowledge and analytical thinking influence one’s rewriting skills, specific disciplinary writing at the graduate level, rather than the undergraduate level, would be more useful. The present study, although it is limited and preliminary, is expected to lead to further research on how students and instructors perceive the appropriate use of source texts.
