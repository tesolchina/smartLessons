# ABSTRACT

Young children can exploit the syntactic context of a novel word to narrow down its probable meaning. This is syntactic bootstrapping. A learner that uses syntactic bootstrapping to foster lexical acquisition must first have identified the semantic information that a syntactic context provides. Based on the semantic seed hypothesis, children discover the semantic predictiveness of syntactic contexts by tracking the distribution of familiar words. We propose that these learning mechanisms relate to a larger cognitive model: the predictive processing framework. According to this model, we perceive and make sense of the world by constantly predicting what will happen next in a probabilistic fashion. We outline evidence that prediction operates within language acquisition and show how this framework helps us understand the way lexical knowledge refines syntactic predictions and how syntactic knowledge refines predictions about novel words’ meanings. The predictive processing framework entails that learners can adapt to recent information and update their linguistic model. Here we review some of the recent experimental work showing that the type of prediction preschool children make from a syntactic context can change when they are presented with contrary evidence from recent input. We end by discussing some challenges of applying the predictive processing framework to syntactic bootstrapping and propose new avenues to investigate in future work.

# 1. Introduction

When acquiring their native language, children have to learn its components: among others, the sounds (i.e., phonology), the words (i.e., lexicon) and the way in which words can be combined to form sentences (i.e., syntax). For a long time, children were thought to acquire these components sequentially. This corresponds to what young children produce: First they babble, then they speak in isolated words, and then they start combining words together. However, research into language development draws a different picture—children tackle language acquisition from all fronts at the same time. That is, young children are immersed in all components of their native language(s) and can use partial knowledge in one domain to help refine their representations in another. These synergies have been observed between different domains. For instance, even a very crude protolexicon can help the learner acquire a phonological system (Feldman et al. 2013; Martin, Peperkamp & Dupoux 2013). In the same vein, young children use syntax to guide word learning (syntactic bootstrapping; e.g., Fisher, Jin & Scott 2020; Gleitman 1990; Gleitman et al. 2005; Landau & Gleitman 1985).

The aim of this article is to present a theory of how language learning gets off the ground by relying on such synergies between lexical and syntactic acquisition. In particular, we propose that children’s early lexicon and their reliance on a predictive processing mechanism can explain how their early syntactic knowledge develops in tandem with their lexical knowledge. We propose that syntactic bootstrapping fits within a broader framework of human cognition: predictive processing. According to this framework, human reasoning, learning, planning, and action rely on our brain operating as a “prediction machine” (e.g., Clark 2013). We survey evidence that prediction also operates within language acquisition and propose that this framework can explain how lexical knowledge gives rise to, and helps refine, syntactic predictions, as well as how syntactic knowledge gives rise to predictions about novel words’ meanings. We start off by surveying syntactic bootstrapping research and go on to ask how syntactic bootstrapping gets started—first, by presenting recent evidence supporting the idea that a few early-learned nouns and verbs may help bootstrap syntactic bootstrapping (the semantic seed hypothesis) and then by surveying evidence for predictive processing in language acquisition and theorizing how these might work together with the semantic seed and syntactic bootstrapping.

# 2. Syntactic bootstrapping and function words

To make predictions about upcoming words, children have been shown to follow a syntactic bootstrapping approach, i.e., they can use information present in the syntactic structures of sentences, such as the number and type of arguments, to identify words and infer their probable meanings (e.g., Fisher et al. 2010; Gleitman et al. 2005; Trueswell, Papafragou & Choi 2011). In its simplest form, this mechanism can rely on co-occurrence patterns and reliable adjacent elements such as function words and morphemes (e.g., determiners, pronouns, auxiliaries, tense endings). Function words’ acoustic, distributional, and phonological characteristics enable infants to distinguish them from content words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) during their first few months of life (Shi & Werker 2001; 2003; Shi, Werker & Morgan 1999). Function words can be particularly useful during early lexical acquisition because they tend to co-occur with specific categories of content words (Chemla et al. 2009; Mintz 2003; Weisleder & Waxman 2010). For instance, in languages such as French and English, determiners tend to precede nouns, and pronouns tend to precede verbs.

Infants have been shown to identify function words and learn about their potential for lexical acquisition early in development (see, e.g., Shi 2014). Function words generally tend to appear at the boundaries of prosodic units (see, e.g., Christophe et al. 2003; Dryer 1992; Gutman et al. 2015; Shi, Morgan & Allopenna 1998)—a position that has been shown to be advantageous for encoding word units (Ferry et al. 2016; Johnson, Seidl & Tyler 2014; Shukla, Nespor & Mehler 2007). Even before their first birthday, infants store and recognize the phonological form of their native language’s frequent function words (e.g., Hallé, Durand & de Boysson-Bardies 2008; Shafer et al. 1998; Shi et al. 2006; Shi, Werker & Cutler 2006; see Shi 2014 for a review) and use them to segment co-occurring content words (Shi & Lepage 2008). They also learn how these different categories of words relate to one another. In a recent study (Babineau & Christophe 2022), infants as young as 11 months were found to track cooccurrence patterns between function words and common content words. French-learning 11-montholds preferred to listen to lists of grammatically correct phrases in which familiar verbs (e.g., mange ‘eat’) occurred after the pronoun tu ‘you’, and familiar nouns (e.g., biberon ‘bottle’) occurred after the determiner des ‘some’ than to lists of ungrammatical phrases in which verbs followed a determiner and nouns followed a pronoun. Around 14 months of age, infants can build expectations about the type of function words that are likely to co-occur with novel content words based on the contexts in which they have previously been heard (Babineau, Shi & Christophe 2020; Höhle et al. 2004; Shi & Melançon 2010): A novel word that co-occurs with determiners is expected to also be used with other determiners, not pronouns. Function words may thus help build a kind of protosyntactic knowledge, which includes the creation of coarse syntactic categories.

This kind of protosyntactic knowledge may well be the key to unlocking much of the language acquisition problem. Since speech, both infant- and adult-directed, is for the most part made up of sentences rather than isolated words (Aslin 1993; Brent & Siskind 2001; van de Weijer 1998), infants must learn the meanings of many content words from hearing them in context. The syntactic context of a novel word, such as the co-occurring function word and morpheme, can serve as a “zoom lens” allowing learners to figure out which part of the world is being talked about and thus narrowing down its possible meaning (e.g., Fisher et al. 1994). When presented with a novel word occurring in a noun context, such as it is a blick, 12- to-14-month-olds assume that it refers to an object (e.g., Waxman 1999; Waxman & Booth 2001). Toddlers, 18 months and older, also assume that blick refers to an action if it is heard in a verb context, such as “he’s blicking” (Bernal et al. 2007; de Carvalho, He et al. 2019; He & Lidz 2017; Oshima-Takane et al. 2011; Waxman et al. 2009).1 Although the majority of syntactic bootstrapping studies have focused on English and other indo-European languages, a smaller number have looked at infants learning other languages, such as Mandarin Chinese (Lee & Naigles 2005), Turkish (Göksun, Küntay & Naigles 2008), and Icelandic (Nowenstein et al. 2020). In the last two languages, researchers not only looked at syntactic but also at morphological bootstrapping. Children were able to use both case marking, which is language specific, and the number of arguments in a sentence, which is said to be universal, to infer novel words’ meaning.

Inferences about a novel word’s syntactic category and lexical features can happen in real time after only two repetitions (de Carvalho, Babineau et al. 2019). The same is true for lexical access to familiar words: When 18-month-olds are presented with familiar object names in a sentence frame, they are faster to orient to the target picture than when the same names are presented in isolation. This suggests that familiar frames may enable the infant to look for, or predict, the end of the sentence more efficiently (Fernald & Hurtado 2006). Likewise, Zangl & Fernald (2007) and Kedar et al. (2017) found that replacing real determiners with nonce determiners disrupted 12- to-24-month-olds’ processing of familiar words.

Children’s sensitivity to the set of function words that co-occur with specific content words may also be greatly beneficial for learning homophones (words that share the same phonological form but have different meanings and that, more often than not, appear in different syntactic contexts; Dautriche et al. 2018).2 Suppose, for instance, that a child already knows one of the meanings of a homophone—for example, the noun meaning of the homophone lit (which can mean either “a bed” or “to read” in French). If the child hears this same word-form for the first time in a verb context, e.g., preceded by a pronoun (such as elle lit “she’s reading”), she can link an additional meaning to the word-form (referring to an action). Indeed, recent work has shown that French-learning 20-montholds easily learn homophones when the two meanings belong to different syntactic categories (Dautriche et al. 2018). Overall, these results point to the possibility that a learner’s knowledge about the distribution of word categories can foster lexical acquisition.

# 3. Bootstrapping the syntactic bootstrapper

Although a large body of evidence shows that young children are able to use the syntactic context of a novel word to infer something about this word’s potential meaning, what remained unclear until recently is how they learn which syntactic contexts correspond to which semantic features—for instance, how do children figure out that words occurring in noun contexts can refer to objects, and how do they learn the characteristics of noun contexts in their language? Based on the semantic seed hypothesis, children learn these associations between syntactic contexts and semantics by generalizing from a handful of words whose meaning they already know—a semantic seed. After grouping the small inventory of known words into coarse semantic categories, they then learn which syntactic elements tend to occur with these familiar words (Brusini et al. 2021; Christophe et al. 2016; Gutman et al. 2015, see also Christodoulopoulos, Roth & Fisher 2016). When do infants start to build these connections between lexical and syntactic knowledge? How do infants use their lexicon and predictive abilities to bootstrap syntactic bootstrapping?

The semantic seed hypothesis is based on empirical findings attesting children’s early lexical knowledge and categorization abilities. By the end of their first year of life, infants have already managed to build a small lexicon through rich social and multimodal experiences (e.g., Bergelson & Swingley 2012, 2013, 2015; Parise & Csibra 2012; Syrnyk & Meints 2017; Tincoff & Jusczyk 1999, 2012). This blossoming lexicon could be exploited as a seed for assigning novel words into syntactic categories, as infants could notice the most frequent syntactic contexts in which different types of seed words tend to appear. Many studies have shown that infants have the ability to track such regularities (e.g., Gomez & Gerken 1999; Hohle et al. 2006; Marchetto & Bonatti 2013; Santelmann & Jusczyk 1998; van Heugten & Johnson 2010). After all, statistical learning skills allow children to acquire many aspects of their native language. For instance, they can compute what sequences of sound form the morphemes and words, in what syntactic contexts these elements tend to appear in, how consistently sounds co-occur, how frequently words occur in similar contexts, etc. (see, e.g., Newport 2016; Saffran, Aslin & Newport 1996). Thus, using their distributional learning skills, infants could track the syntactic contexts of the semantic seed (e.g., ball and car appear in “This is a ball,” “This is a car”), learn which kind of words tend to appear in these contexts, and later infer that a novel word appearing in the same context is likely to share some properties with these known words (e.g., “This is $\vec { \mathrm { \Phi } } ^ { \prime \prime } + \vec { \mathrm { \Phi } } ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { d a x } ^ { \prime \prime }$ $- > \mathrm { d a x } =$ object). This follows the established proposal that young children expect words that share conceptual or semantic properties to occur in similar syntactic contexts (Gleitman 1990; Pinker 1984). These expectations are likely to be subjected to interindividual differences linked to the breadth of syntactic knowledge. For instance, Wojcik & Saffran (2015) found that 26- to 28-month-olds with more advanced syntactic knowledge (i.e., those who were combining words in their own speech productions) were more likely to encode relations between novel words occurring in the same sentential position (as subject/agent in the training sentences). Given the research findings described previously and the current state of knowledge in infancy research, the semantic seed hypothesis describes plausible synergies in early syntactic and lexical acquisition that were recently supported by computational models and experimental work involving young children and adults.

Several computational models have provided more direct evidence supporting the main assumptions of the semantic seed hypothesis: (i) the context of a word contains relevant information enabling its categorization, (ii) categorization is efficient when it is based on a handful of words that are already known (a seed). First, many unsupervised computational models using the context of words to categorize them have obtained better-than-chance performance (Chemla et al. 2009; Chrupała & Alishahi 2010; Mintz 2003; Parisien, Fazly & Stevenson 2008; Redington, Chater & Finch 1998; Wang et al. 2011; Weisleder & Waxman 2010). Second, in Brusini et al. (2021), a very simple algorithm extracting two-word contexts of syntactically categorized content words (the seed) was sufficient to categorize test words with high precision. In fact, even a limited semantic seed size (eight nouns and one verb) provided during the training phase allowed ${ \sim } 9 0 \%$ of new nouns and ${ \sim } 8 0 \%$ of new verbs to be correctly categorized at test. These findings indicate that even with a small lexicon, young language learners could use familiar words to start forming protosyntactic categories.

Based on Brusini et al.’s (Forthcoming) model, children might discover the predictiveness of function words by tracking the immediate context of familiar words. To demonstrate experimentally that young children can indeed learn protosyntactic categories this way, Babineau et al. (2021) familiarized 3- to 4-year-olds to a seed lexicon co-occurring with a novel syntactic context—the novel function word $^ { \mathrm { e } } \mathrm { k o }$ .” Participants watched a training video in which the novel function word “ko” either replaced pronouns (verb condition) or articles (noun condition) in sentences containing familiar words in French (see Figure 1). After this training phase, participants were shown two videos side by side: one depicting an actor holding a novel object, and the other depicting an actor performing a novel action while hearing novel content words co-occurring with the novel function word (e.g., Oh look, ko dase!). Participants in the verb condition looked and pointed significantly more toward the novel actions than participants in the noun condition (see Figure 2). This study showed that 3- to4-year-olds managed to rapidly and efficiently undertake a distributional analysis to learn the semantic predictiveness of a novel function word—providing preliminary experimental support for the semantic seed hypothesis.

Figure 1. Example of the script used in the two versions of the training video. The same script was used in both conditions, with “ko” replacing pronouns in the verb condition and articles in the noun condition.

This first attempt of Babineau et al. (2021) to obtain direct evidence for the learning mechanism that bootstraps the syntactic bootstrapper has two notable limitations: First, this study tested preschoolers; the semantic seed hypothesis entails that this learning strategy would be most useful during the second year of life—when infants have already acquired a restricted, but large-enough, lexicon (e.g., Bergelson & Swingley 2012) and the necessary computational skills to track distributional patterns (e.g., Gomez & Gerken 1999). Second, the novel functor’s position and use was identical with those of familiar function words in French. That is, the novel function word “ko” simply replaced existing function words and could have been treated as such. To obtain more compelling evidence in support of the semantic seed hypothesis, the learnability of other morphosyntactic regularities needs to be tested. For instance, noun class systems are widespread across the world’s languages, with semantic features of nouns (natural gender, animacy, shape) often being associated with the class (Aikhenvald 2000; Denny 1976; Dixon 1986). Inspection of cross-linguistic universals reveals that across the world’s languages, certain conceptual-categories distinctions are often marked in morphosyntax (e.g., object/action, animate/inanimate), and others are not (e.g., electronic/nonelectronic; Strickland 2017). It has been argued that this is because morphosyntactic regularities in human languages would more likely be associated with conceptual distinctions that are clearly salient to infants and young children, such as core conceptual categories (Spelke & Kinzler 2007). Hence, novel morphosyntactic regularities should be learnable as long as they are marking core knowledge categories.

Proportion of looks toward the action video, time-locked to the onset of the trial for the verb condition (purple curve) and the noun condition (orange curve). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. A nonparametric cluster-based permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld 2007) revealed significant differences between the verb and the noun conditions starting slightly after the onset of the novel function word $" \mathrm { k } 0 "$ (gray time-window). The novel function word $" \mathrm { k } 0 "$ appeared about 1,413 ms after the onset of the trial (307 ms before the significant time-window) and appeared again at $6 , 9 3 3 ~ \mathsf { m s } ,$ .

Animacy, as a conceptual property, is a highly salient property that is detected early in life by infants (e.g., Molina et al. 2004; Rakison & Poulin-Dubois 2001; Rostad, Yott & Poulin-Dubois 2012). Past work has shown that toddlers use animacy-based characteristics of familiar content words to guide their inferences about the meaning of novel words. Ferguson, Graf & Waxman (2014) found that 19-month-olds looked more at a stuffed animal than at an artifact when hearing a sentence in which the novel noun “dax” is the subject of the animate-selecting construction “the dax is crying.” Hence, infants are able to use a verb’s selectional restrictions (here, that only animates can cry) to infer whether a novel noun is animate or inanimate. Similarly, Yuan et al. (2011) found that 2-year-olds who heard the novel verb “stipe” co-occurring with known animal names such as “pig” associated it with animacy. At test, when asked “Which one can stipe?”, they looked more at a picture of a familiar animal (e.g., a cat) than at an inanimate object (e.g., a spoon). Here, children were shown to use a semantic seed (a group of familiar animal names) to infer the novel verb’s selectional restrictions (that only animates can “stipe”). What is missing from these studies, however, is a demonstration of whether and how infants can use familiar content words to learn about new function words and their role as morphosyntactic markers of animacy.

These issues were addressed in a recent study with 20-month-old infants. Barbir et al. (2019) tested French-learning infants’ ability to learn a novel noun class system grounded in semantic properties that are not syntactically encoded in their native language, i.e., animate/inanimate, but are correlated with the specific syntactic properties of noun phrases in many languages (e.g., Algonquian languages, Bantu languages).3 Participants had to learn that a novel determiner “ko” was restricted to occur before animate agents, and the novel determiner “ka” appeared only before inanimate objects (e.g., ko chien, ka poussette, ‘ko dog,’ ‘ka stroller’). As in Babineau et al. (2021), the novel function words were introduced using a short training video, in which an actress played with toy animals and objects while uttering sentences using the novel determiners ‘ko’ and ‘ka’ appropriately before animate or inanimate common nouns (but otherwise using French syntax, prosody, and lexicon). Since participants were younger, a longer exposure was offered, and families were instructed to show the training video at home on three successive days before coming to the lab. During the test phase in the lab, infants watched two pictures side by side (one depicting an animate agent and the other inanimate) and listened to sentences containing novel words preceded by either “ko” or by “ka.” Infants looked more toward the novel animal when hearing novel words embedded in sentences such as “look at ko bamoule!” than when hearing sentences such as “look at ka pirdale!” (see Figure 3). These findings provide strong evidence in support of the semantic seed hypothesis. They are even more remarkable when the size of the semantic seed provided to the participating infants in this task is taken into account: six animates with “ko” and six inanimates with “ka.”

A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that infants looked significantly longer toward the animate agent when hearing sentences with “ko” than when hearing sentences with $" { \sf k } { \sf a } ^ { \prime \prime }$ at test, between $3 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m s }$ and $2 , 4 4 0 \mathrm { m s }$ $( p = . 0 1 )$ .

The computational and experimental work reviewed previously strongly supports the semantic seed hypothesis, thereby confirming young children’s ability to generalize from a small set of exemplars (see Gerken & Bollt, 2008), which is highly beneficial for both syntax and vocabulary development. This process of generalization does not manifest itself only in categorization but also in the ability to rapidly build representations of predictive contexts, with $^ { \alpha } \mathrm { k o } ^ { \mathrm { 3 } }$ and $^ { \mathrm { \infty } } \mathrm { k } \mathrm { a } ^ { \mathrm { \infty } }$ predicting this newly cued category distinction between animates and inanimates. Infants here can be said to show an urge to understand their linguistic input and generate expectations/predictions based on their limited state of knowledge.

# 4. Bootstrapping and linguistic predictions

We have seen how young children can learn new syntactic contexts as well as how they successfully use them to create novel expectations and constrain their interpretation of novel words. They can, therefore, be considered as predictive learners (see Chang et al. 2006). What children seem to be learning here, and incredibly fast, are statistical regularities in their input. Distributional learning is a key, yet simple, mechanism present from birth: Even newborns have been shown to segment the speech stream (i.e., finding the boundaries between words) by tracking distributional cues (e.g., Fló et al. 2019). However, the regularities that structure input to infants do more than signal the boundaries of words—they can be used to narrow down the number of possibilities for the meaning of words as well. Processing syntactic contexts thus allows infants to predict certain things about their language. When young learners listen to and process linguistic input, certain expectations arise even before complete bottom-up information becomes available (see Lau, Holcomb & Kuperberg 2013 for a discussion). These representations may be, among other things, phonological (e.g., faster selection of vowel-initial words following the English determiner an, Gambi et al. 2018) or semantic (e.g., expectation of an edible object following the word “eat,” Mani & Heuttig 2012; or of a causative meaning for a verb occurring in a transitive construction, Lee & Naigles 2008).

To understand the significance of the idea of prediction, we need to take a broader look beyond the field of language acquisition to the idea of predictive processing in cognitive and brain science. Predictive processing has been proposed to underlie the way our brain operates in a variety of domains (e.g., Clark 2013). According to the predictive processing framework, we perceive and make sense of the world by constantly predicting what will happen next in a probabilistic fashion using our current best model of the world around us. When these predictions fail, lower networks, for example, those of perception, “trickle up,” affecting increasingly higher levels of cognition and planning—serving at each level to update our model of the world for future predictions. Viewed through the lens of language acquisition, it has been proposed that children learn language through prediction and error-based learning (e.g., Chang, Dell & Bock, 2006; Dell & Chang 2014; Elman 1990; Zettersten 2019). Children’s best model of their linguistic environment leads them to create predictions about everything from the phonological form of the next word in a sentence (e.g., 3–5-year-olds already start to look more at the referent of a word beginning with a vowel after hearing the determiner an than after the determiner a, though this skill continues to improve until adulthood, Gambi et al. 2018) to its meaning (e.g., Gambi et al. 2018), syntactic category (e.g., Cauvet et al. 2014; Shi & Melançon 2010), and grammatical gender (e.g., Lew-Williams & Fernald 2007, 2010; van Heugten & Johnson 2011). When these predictions fail, infants experience an error response—the strength of which correlates with children’s vocabulary scores (Fernald, Perfors & Marchman 2006; Marchman & Fernald 2008; Reuter et al. 2018; Ylinen et al. 2017). This suggests that stronger predictive processing skills enable infants to better make use of these word learning situations (see, e.g., Reuter, Borovsky & Lew-Williams 2019; though the reverse explanation—that more robust linguistic experience supports predictive processing—will be discussed in the following). In adults, stronger violation of expectations leads to stronger abstract structural knowledge of an artificial language (Bovolenta & Marsden 2020), though this has not yet been tested in children or infants.

Rabagliati, Gambi & Pickering (2016) cast doubt on whether, at the time of writing their article, evidence existed to support the role of prediction in language learning or whether the then-current literature should have been interpreted as only showing skilled language users’ ability to use prediction (having already learned to predict). They presented two conditions that would need to be met to show this effect: (i) that children make the types of prediction that are necessary for learning, and (ii) that prediction is a cause and not (only) an effect of language learning. They believed that these requirements, which support the claim that prediction might propel language acquisition, were yet to be met. We would argue that the years that have passed since Rabagliati, Gambi & Pickering’s (2016) publication have changed this picture. The studies presented in the last paragraph seem to already satisfy these conditions: Gambi et al. (2018) showed semantic prediction (e.g., “Can you see one . . . ball/two . . . ice creams?”) in 2- to-5-year-olds—which would be one type of prediction relevant for learning, and Ylinen et al. (2017) showed that error signals are present in 12-month-olds when prediction about the end of a common word fails. Another recent study (Gambi, Jindal et al. 2021) found that 2- to-5-year-olds were able to make graded predictions (not only predicting the most likely ending for a sentence but also considering other, less likely, options) and that this ability improved with age. Interestingly, children’s ability to make these graded predictions, as well as their processing speed, predicted their vocabulary scores when tested again after 7 months. What remains to be shown is children’s ability to adapt their predictions and that prediction is directly related to language learning.

A recent study examined whether young children could rapidly adapt their syntactic predictions and use their adapted predictions to infer the intended meaning of homophones. Havron et al. (2021) exposed 3- to 4-year-olds to a syntactic context that can precede either nouns or verbs in French with the goal of manipulating the expected syntactic category. In French, la petite can be followed either by a noun (la petite pomme, ‘the little apple’) or by a verb (la petite mange, ‘the little [one] is eating’). In the first phase of the experiment, this syntactic context was made highly predictive of different categories for different groups of participants. Children in the noun group heard sentences where la petite was followed by familiar nouns and children in the verb group heard sentences where la petite was followed by familiar verbs. At test, children were exposed to familiar noun-verb homophones following la petite (e.g., la petite ferme can be interpreted as either ‘the little farm’ or ‘the little [one] closes’). Children for whom la petite preceded familiar verbs in the first phase of the experiment were more likely to interpret the homophone as a verb than children for whom it preceded familiar nouns in the training phase (see also Havron et al. 2020 for an experiment with 5- to 6-year-olds that looked at the resolution of another type of global ambiguity—attachment ambiguity).

A second study directly examined whether 3- to 4-year-olds could update the model of their linguistic environment to generate predictions about the meaning of novel words. Havron et al. (2019) used the same preceding context, la petite, but this time, at test it was followed by a novel word (e.g., dase) that could be interpreted as either a noun or a verb in French (e.g., Tu vois? La petite dase! ‘Do you see? The little dase/the little [one] dases!’). Children for whom la petite preceded familiar verbs in the first phase of the experiment were more likely to infer that a novel word appearing in this context referred to an action than children for whom it preceded familiar nouns. Thus, young children were shown to rapidly update their models of what category of words should follow certain syntactic contexts and use their updated model to generate predictions immediately—to guide their learning of novel words. In this experiment, prediction structured and guided preschoolers’ inferences about a novel word’s meaning. This study was replicated twice with French- and English-speaking children (see Swanson, Frank & Degen 2021). Given that there was no evidence of a difference in effect size in the two experiments from Havron et al. (i.e., the one looking at homophones and the other at novel words), the authors interpreted these findings as pointing to a unity of the processes active in language processing and learning, as hypothesized in the predictive processing framework. That is, children use their best model of linguistic input to predict what speakers would say next, they rapidly update this model to fit any new evidence they encounter, and they deploy their updated model to process familiar words and learn new words with no clear distinction between learning and processing (see Havron et al. 2021). To summarize, these studies show how syntactic contexts allow children to predict certain things about their language—relating to the idea of syntactic bootstrapping but adding to it the dimension of children’s ability to adaptively change their predictive models of syntax.

Looking at syntactic bootstrapping through the lens of the predictive processing framework can also help gain insight into the question of how children choose which linguistic levels to rely on for making predictions (phonology, lexicon, syntax) despite the fact that their knowledge of each level is incomplete. How does the predictive processing framework shed light on this problem?

In a recent study (Beretti, Havron & Christophe 2020), researchers explored children’s ability to adapt their predictions at the lexical and the syntactic levels. Two groups of 4- to 5-year-old French children were presented with sentences that are ungrammatical without context such as elle balle ‘she ball(s).’ The critical manipulation in this experiment was the contextual support provided to the seemingly ungrammatical sentences. In one group of children (syntactically-reliable-speaker group), the ungrammatical sentences were presented with videos supporting novel meanings for the familiar word forms (e.g., as if the phrase “She balls” referred to a novel action being performed by a girl). In the other group of children (semantically-reliable-speaker group), the ungrammatical sentences were presented with videos depicting the familiar meanings of the words (e.g., a girl holding a ball while hearing elle balle ‘she balls,’ which would be interpreted as an error in the use of a function word). This manipulation prompted children to update their syntactic predictions. At test, children from both groups were presented with two videos and asked to choose the one that best illustrated the sentence they heard. For example, while listening to “ungrammatical sentences” (e.g., une dort ‘a sleeps’), participants saw two videos side by side: one presenting the reasonable choice if the sentence was believed to be syntactically correct (e.g., une dort ‘a sleeps’ describes a novel object) and another video presenting the reasonable choice if the sentence was believed to be semantically correct despite the ungrammatical use of function words (e.g., ‘a sleeps’ describes a girl sleeping). Children who had been led to expect function words to be unreliable cues (i.e., those in the semantically-reliable-speaker group exposed to semantically correct sentences involving erroneous function words) pointed more to the event of the girl sleeping than children who had been led to expect the meanings of familiar content words to be unreliable cues (i.e., those in the syntactically-reliable-speaker group exposed to syntactically correct sentences involving new homophones (see Figure 4).

These results showed that children can not only adjust their syntactic predictions as in Havron et al. (2019, 2021) but also meta-adjust whether they should be learning about new lexical items (i.e., novel homophones) based on their knowledge of syntax or learning about syntactic contexts based on their knowledge of the lexicon (here, either stopping to rely on syntactic contexts or reversing their expectations, starting to expect a verb to follow a determiner). This is consistent with Bayesian optimization predictive inferences. According to this idea, a sentence is interpreted by taking into account a listener’s prior expectations and combining them with new evidence to generate adjusted predictions (in Bayesian terms the posterior). To give another example, if an English-speaking child, for example, expects the words “the baby” to be followed by a noun $6 3 \%$ of the time (e.g., “the baby elephant”) and by a verb $3 7 \%$ of the time (e.g., “the baby jumps”), but they have recently heard four examples of “the baby VERBs,” they would adapt their model to expect “the baby” to be followed by a noun only $6 0 \%$ or $5 0 \%$ or $3 0 \%$ of the time (the exact number will depend not only on the predicted probability but also on their confidence in this prediction). Four examples of “the baby NOUNs,” the more frequent option, would be expected to cause smaller changes to the model.

As mentioned, the decision of whether and which level to adapt (here, syntactic cues or lexical information) is a meta-Bayesian decision, that is, choosing between two models which are themselves Bayesian. This idea was suggested by the noisy channel models of language processing (Clayard et al.

![](img/b7077f94595144b5ab4346279dbd8c436590a1b225b5a2aeaf2f1792e603b573.jpg)  
Figure 4. Example of a test trial from Beretti, Havron & Christophe (2020). On the right is the video containing a novel object, a plausible interpretation of the sentence une dort, “a sleeps,” if children interpret the test sentences as being syntactically correct and thus referring to a novel meaning for a word they already know, a homophone of the verb “sleep”). On the left is the video containing a familiar action (e.g., a woman sleeping), a plausible interpretation of the sentence if children interpret the test sentences as being semantically correct (i.e., “sleep” in the sentence $^ { \prime \prime } { \sf a }$ sleep” means to sleep) despite the unreliability of function words in the context of the experiment. Note that in the induction phase, there was only one viable interpretation open to the participants: a novel word for the syntactically-reliable-speaker group (i.e., homophones group) and a familiar object or action for the semantically-reliable-speaker group—it is only at test that these two options were both presented to the participants, with words that were not presented during the induction phase.

2008; Gibson, Betgen & Piantadosi 2013; Levy 2008). Following noisy-channel models, the listener estimates which information, i.e., syntactic versus lexical, is more likely to be unreliable, and adjusts accordingly to their (lexical or syntactic) expectations in the face of a prediction error. This unreliability, or noise, can either come from the input they perceive now (Is it reliable?) or their own representations (Are they robust? Are they certain?). In Beretti, Havron & Christophe (2020), children were led to trust their syntactic knowledge more in one condition than in the other, showing that children do not have one default route (always use syntax to learn words or always use familiar words to learn about syntax) but can choose between these options by relying on contextual cues to judge where the error signal is most likely to result from. However promising, these findings offer limited support to the idea that prediction is directly related to language learning, as this experiment was done with 4- to 5-year-olds, and the one from Havron et al. (2019, 2021) with 3- to 4-year-olds. To support the role of predictive processing in the first phases of language learning, and reliably connect this with the semantic seed hypothesis, we would need to extend these findings to infants, first conceptually and then practically.

Conceptually, we would expect young infants to deploy the same Bayesian adaptation processes by determining the level of noise at different linguistic levels depending on the context they are in. That is, the more noisy or uncertain a predictive model is, the less likely infants are to rely on it. The syntactic bootstrapping and the semantic seed literature demonstrate the presence of such an ability to use two different levels of abstraction for prediction. For example, infants who have managed to learn that certain syntactic contexts are likely to predict nouns or object labels (e.g., “this is $\mathsf { a } ^ { \mathfrak { W } } + \mathsf { O B } \mathsf { J E C T } )$ would be able to learn other noun contexts when familiar words repeatedly appear in them (e.g., “here is the” $^ { \cdot } +$ OBJECT). They would use these familiar contexts to infer that novel words occurring in these contexts are also labels for objects (e.g., “this is a dase” $^ - >$ dase is an object too). Thus, they would be able to use their rudimentary semantic categories to build syntactic predictions, and their rudimentary noun category to add lexical items to their lexicon more efficiently. This does not yet show, however, that their choice of which category to adapt depends on the level of noise in their representation or input.

The idea that the level of noise perceived by infants determines which sources of information they would rely on is supported by findings showing that some syntactic contexts trigger stronger predictions than others. For example, in some languages, determiners may be more reliable cues to the syntactic category of an adjacent novel word than are subject pronouns: In German, the determiner ein is followed by a noun in $7 1 \%$ of cases; the personal pronoun sie is followed by a verb in $3 1 \%$ of cases (based on a child-directed corpus reported in Höhle et al. 2004). Similar distributional patterns were found in French (Cecyre & Shi 2005). Accordingly, two previous studies have found that although 14- month-olds can build expectations about the type of function words that can co-occur with novel nouns (based on their past occurrence after determiners), they cannot build such expectations for novel verbs (based on their occurrence after pronouns; Höhle et al. 2004; Shi & Melançon 2010). When additional cues are available, infants can successfully predict the syntactic category of novel words, whether nouns or verbs. A recent study found that French-learning 14-month-old infants can build expectations about novel verbs co-occurring with pronouns when familiar words are present in the familiarization phase (Babineau, Shi & Christophe 2020). In this case, the experimental manipulation strengthened the reliability of pronouns as cues to verbs for the task at hand. Thus, infants might avoid relying on noisy or unreliable sources of information, but strengthening the reliability of the available cues (e.g., distributional cues) does trigger syntactic prediction. Another piece of evidence comes from semantic predictions. Borovsky et al. (2016) found that 24-month-olds performed better on items with higher semantic density (items that have a more robust lexical model) in two real-time comprehension tasks (lexical recognition and sentence processing); lower-density items experienced more interference. That is, more weight was given to new information when the predictive model was less robust.

One aspect of predictive processing that was overlooked in these studies (Berreti, Havron & Christophe 2020; Havron et al. 2019, 2021) is the anticipatory aspect of prediction—using prediction to speed along processing and expecting, for example, the end of a sentence before it is completed by the speaker. The same is true for other classical work dealing with error-based learning in language acquisition (Branigan & Messenger 2016; Peter et al. 2015). The theory, as discussed here, does not require that representations be preactivated and early anticipation be formed, only that representations will be updated after the novel data has been comprehended by the child and incorporated by them in their syntactic predictive model. However, the classical predictive processing studies in language acquisition (Mani & Huettig 2012; Borovsky et al. 2014), as well as most recent studies (e.g., Gambi, Jindal et al. 2021), do focus on anticipation. What, if anything, does real-time prediction add to this theory? Language comprehension and learning happens in real time (see, e.g., Christiansen & Chater 2016; de Carvalho et al. 2019; Nappa et al. 2009; Trueswell 2008; Trueswell et al. 1999), and although infants might be slow to respond, or even slow to look at a correct image, one of the goals of predictive processing is to reduce this gap. Seamless communication requires fast action by both the recipient and the sender of the message. The role of prediction is not only to make the recipient’s inference about intended meaning more likely to be correct but also to make it more efficient in terms of resources and time. That would mean that both types of studies, those looking at how predictive contexts make comprehension better and those looking at how children adapt their predictions, contribute to understanding how predictive processing benefits language comprehension and acquisition. A welcome addition will be to conduct studies that incorporate both.

To summarize, children have been shown to use predictive processing to adapt their syntactic expectations in both language processing and learning. They were also shown to be flexibly adapting to the learning context by giving more weight to syntax or their lexicon based on the source of noise in their input. This aligns nicely with studies showing that the robustness of children’s predictive model affects their predictions: More weight seems to be given to new information when the predictive model is less robust.

# 5. Challenges to the predictive processing approach in language acquisition

One challenge to the predictive processing approach in language acquisition would seem to come from a literature showing that young children sometimes fail at revising their prediction: the kindergartenpath effect (e.g., Huang & Hollister 2019; Trueswell et al. 1999). If children learn from prediction errors based on local context, how could learning occur if they fail to perceive their errors?

A predictive processing account of cognition does allow for our predictions to be so strong that we do not record an error when one occurs. To give an example, one might create such a strong prediction that a pacifier on the floor is a spider, based on partial evidence, that they would leave the room without noticing their error—not examining the truth of their prediction. Thus, one way to answer the challenge posed by the kindergarten path effect would be to look into why, under the same circumstances, some children are able to revise their expectations, and others do not seem to do so. Recent work might shed light on this issue. Reuter, Borovsly & Lew-Williams (2019) used predictive contexts with a visual world paradigm. In the more constraining contexts, 3- to 5-year-old children saw, for example, a truck and a novel object that does not look like something someone could drive and heard: “Vroom! You can drive the feb!” In less constraining contexts they heard, for example: “Where is the feb?” while viewing the same objects (i.e., the truck vs. the novel object). The results showed that children who initially predicted a familiar referent and then redirected their attention to a novel referent showed greater accuracy at learning the label for the new object. Gambi, Pickering et al. (2021) used a similar design and tested 2- to 4-year-olds and adults. Interestingly, like in the kindergartenpath effect, both age groups sometimes still chose the familiar object (e.g., the truck) despite the novel label (e.g., feb), and did this more often when the context was more constraining (e.g., “You can drive the feb”). Gambi, Pickering et al. (2021) found that when children did select the novel referent during the learning phase, children demonstrated above-chance retention of the association between the novel word and this novel referent. These children were capable of revising and updating their expectations based on the failed predictions on most trials. Taken together, one possible explanation for these results is that children with stronger priors failed to update their expectations, but those who did not have such strong priors not only updated their priors but also showed greater accuracy when they redirected their attention after a wrong prediction rather than directly look at the novel object.

A second challenge to the predictive processing account of language learning is that all studies described in this article were either conducted in a laboratory setting or were computational models relying on clear and clean input (transcribed text). The real world is noisy in many different ways: Parents differ in how they use language; the same parents use language differently in different situations; events that occur around the child are distracting; and language development does not happen in an isolated way but rather relies on many extralinguistic factors such as reference, sight, and touch. If researchers cannot find traces of predictive processing (or for that matter, syntactic bootstrapping) in the real world, these mechanisms might be very limited in their ability to explain how language is actually learned. For now, it is not that such studies in the real world have failed, but that— to our knowledge—they were never conducted.

A third challenge is the languages studied. Although syntactic bootstrapping has been studied in a few languages other than English and French (e.g., in Mandarin Chinese: Lee & Naigles 2005; in Turkish: Göksun, Küntay & Naigles 2008; and in Icelandic: Nowenstein et al. 2020), and prediction of sentence ending has been studied in German (Mani & Heuttig 2012), we know of no prediction adaptation studies in children in languages other than English and French. We plan to test prediction adaptation in Hebrew and Arabic ourselves. We believe it is also extremely important to test syntactic (or more generally, structural) bootstrapping, prediction of utterance ending, and adaptation in Signed languages (see, e.g., Gleitman et al. 2019). Without taking a broader look at whether and how these mechanisms play a role in diverse languages and situations, we cannot know to what extent current findings are generalizable and whether they are restricted to some very specific European languages.

A last challenge to the predictive processing account of language learning is participants’ age. If language learning relies on prediction mechanisms, these mechanisms should be present and strong enough to compute syntactic regularities from very early on. The semantic seed account hypothesizes that sometime during the second half of their first year of life, infants would have already learned a few seed words and used those to begin to learn the most frequent and reliable contexts that predict them. Even though recent work has demonstrated infants’ sensitivity to the context of these early known seed words (Babineau & Christophe 2022) and their ability to build syntactic expectations based on these frequent and reliable co-occurrence patterns (e.g., Babineau, Shi & Christophe 2020), some recent studies have failed to find evidence for prediction adaptation in children younger than 3 years of age (e.g., Havron, Babineau & Christophe 2021; Havron et al. 2021).

A few studies have found that young children can use function words predictively by anticipating the likely features of the target word before its onset. In Lukyanenko & Fisher (2016), 2.5-year-olds used agreeing verbs to predict number features of an upcoming noun (e.g., children listening to the sentence “Where are the cookies?” started to look toward a picture with two cookies before they heard the noun onset). In Shi & Melançon (2010), French-learning 2.5-year-olds used French gendermarked determiners predictively; children started to look toward a familiar target picture before they heard the target-noun (e.g., le joli ballon ‘the pretty ball’). In line with these results, Gambi et al. (2018) found that 3- to 5-year-olds start to reliably use the determiner an to predict whether the following word will begin with a vowel. However, they found that 2-year-olds were unable to do so. This latter finding mirrors what Havron et al. (2021) reported, i.e., that 3–4-year-old children were able to adjust their syntactic predictions and use those to disambiguate a homophone, but 2-year-olds showed no evidence of this. Similarly, a recent study examined French 18-month-old infants’ syntactic adaptation using the syntactic frame la petite, which can precede either nouns or verbs, the same one that was used to demonstrate syntactic adaptation in 3- to 4-year-olds in two studies (Havron et al. 2019, 2021). Unlike the other studies mentioned previously (e.g., Havron et al. 2019, 2021; Gambi et al. 2018), which used a looking-while-listening paradigm, this study used a habituation paradigm.

Habituation not only places less processing burden on infants (who do not need to process and compare two videos or images at the same time) but also allows much more exposure. In Havron et al. (2021), infants were exposed to la petite sentences followed by either familiar nouns or familiar verbs mixed in with a novel word appearing after la petite (la petite crale). At test, infants heard the same novel word in noun contexts in one block and in verb contexts in another. If infants indeed rapidly created and deployed expectations during the habituation phase, they should be surprised and look longer when the novel word appears in contexts that are incongruent with the syntactic category of the familiar words appearing after la petite in the habituation stage. For example, if la petite was predictive of nouns during habituation, and given that the novel word also appeared after la petite during the habituation phase, infants should have categorized it as a noun and should have been surprised to hear it in a verb context at test. However, 18-month-olds failed to show signs of syntactic adaptation in this task.

Taken together, these findings do point to a developmental time-course whereby linguistic prediction (anticipation and adaptation) becomes more efficient as children mature and acquire more experience with language. However, Zhang et al. (2019), using nonlinguistic stimuli (sounds such as a xylophone or trill predicting an image), showed identical prediction effects in adults and 6-monthold infants. Reuter et al. (2018) also found adaptation of nonlinguistic predictions in 12- to 24-montholds. In their experiment, a central cue reliably predicted the side of the screen where the target would appear. In the middle of the experiment the target side changed. They found that infants with larger vocabularies were more efficient in updating their predictions to the new target side. This leads us to present three (nonmutually exclusive) possibilities for the null findings obtained with young infants in syntactic adaptation and linguistic prediction experiments.

First, task demands may interfere with infants’ ability to display their underlying capabilities. They are slower, have smaller short-term memory capacities, and do not concentrate on the task as much as older children (and older children do not do as well as adults, e.g., in Beretti, Havron & Christophe 2020; see Havron et al. 2020 for a discussion). Task demands are not only a technical, in-lab confound. The daily demands of perceiving live input accurately, processing it, and generalizing from it would also weigh more heavily on younger infants. Indeed, Huettig & Janse (2016) tested adults’ linguistic predictions (the rapidity to which they looked at an image of a noun that agrees with the determiner in gender) and found that higher working-memory abilities and faster processing speed predicted adults’ anticipatory eye movements. Similarly, faster looks to target pictures were found in children, as their processing speed abilities increase (e.g. Fernald, Swingley & Pinto 2001; see also Bergelson 2020). Other cognitive capacities that are still underdeveloped in young children, including cognitive control and executive functions (see, e.g., Woodard, Pozzan & Trueswell 2016), might also account for this difficulty dealing with the experimental tasks that were used in the past and maybe with real-life predictions as well.

Second, adaptation happens when the current predictive model of language is not sufficient (i.e., results in errors) for the context at hand. Thus, another possibility is that infants, but not children, fail in syntactic adaptation experiments because they fail to evaluate the reliability of their knowledge, a necessary component for adaptation to occur. Although the ability to verbally report on the reliability of one’s own linguistic knowledge is a late achievement that emerges at around 4 to 5 years of age (e.g., Gleitman & Gleitman 2020; Marazita & Merriman 2004), an expanding literature suggests that the ability to evaluate one’s own representations and processes is separate from the ability to consciously access and report on such evaluations (“core metacognition”; see, e.g., Goupil & Kouider 2019). For example, there is evidence that infants are able to evaluate the reliability of their knowledge or decisions years before they can provide verbal reports of their knowledge states (e.g., Balcomb & Gerken 2008; Goupil & Kouider 2016; Goupil, RomandMonnier & Kouider 2016). More recently, Dautriche et al. (2021) also found evidence that even 2-year-olds can evaluate the reliability of their lexical knowledge. In a modified version of the looking-while-listening task (Golinkoff et al. 1987), infants looked longer toward the image they chose as the target when they had reasons to be sure about that word’s meaning. Although this suggests that the rudimentary self-assessment of linguistic knowledge may be available early on in development, it remains an open question whether such an ability is fully developed in early ages, extends to other levels of linguistic knowledge (i.e., syntax), and can be used by infants as a cue to update their knowledge.

Third, it might be that linguistic prediction occurs only when linguistic knowledge is robust and stable enough to allow predictions, meaning that in all the cases of null results discussed, the structures tested might not have been known well enough by the infants tested. This possibility is in line with our suggestion: Infants rely on very frequent and highly predictive syntactic contexts to predict a syntactic category but do not do so when contexts are more variable (for example, young children are able to predict that nouns will follow determiners before they can predict that verbs are likely to follow pronouns)—and would thus confirm predictions derived from the predictive processing account of language learning.

Previous research found a positive correlation between children’s vocabulary and their prediction skills (e.g., Borovsky & Creel 2014; Borovsky, Elman & Fernald 2012; Lew-Williams & Fernald 2007; Mani & Huettig 2012; Ylinen et al. 2017), but to our knowledge the correlation between syntactic knowledge and prediction skills has not yet been examined. Nevertheless, since vocabulary and syntactic knowledge are highly correlated (see, e.g., Levine et al. 2020), and, as described previously, probably also synergistically depend on each other, it is very likely that children with more robust syntactic knowledge show better prediction skills. Additionally, language production seems to support linguistic prediction in adults (here, in the sense of anticipation of a word, not in the sense of adaptation to changes, Lelonkiewicz, Rabagliati & Pickering 2021). It is therefore possible that adaptation of predictions is more difficult for infants who cannot yet produce such sentences themselves.

Therefore, even if prediction is a core characteristic of the way our brain works, is present from birth and does not improve with age in the same way that abilities like short-term memory or processing speed do—linguistic predictions could improve, become stronger and faster, and affect more complex levels of linguistic processing as children acquire more linguistic experience. The developmental route of the strength of adaptation would not be linear: When infants have no active predictive model of a certain category or area of language (e.g., 6-month-olds might be unable to predict whether a verb is transitive or intransitive) they attempt no prediction. When they have acquired enough experience to attempt a prediction, but this prediction is based on just enough but little experience and rudimentary priors, they will show strong changes in their predictions in the face of new evidence. When their model is robust, they will show weaker adaptation (as any new piece of evidence carries less weight). This theoretical proposal has not (yet) been supported by existing evidence; however, it makes several concrete predictions that should be tested before we might consider discarding it. First, we should be able to find prediction adaptation in infants younger than 2 years of age if we test them on highly frequent and reliable syntactic contexts. Second, infants’ ability to predict should not be independent from the type and level of predictions the task requires them to make. For example, very young infants already distinguish between maternal speech that has been interrupted at clausal boundaries and matched speech that has been interrupted at within-clause locations (see e.g., Kemler Nelson et al. 1989), implying that infants could be predicting clause boundaries based on prosodic cues. Phrasal-boundary prosody would therefore be hypothesized to show prediction earlier than, for example, syntactic contexts. Third, the more language experience an infant has, the earlier they would attempt a prediction, and the more robust their models will be. To see this in children, though, we would have to control for children’s age and cognitive abilities (e.g., a child with stronger memory skills is likely to succeed better in our tasks in the lab than a child with lower memory skills; we would thus need to test different groups of children with the same memory skills but differing in their linguistic experience).

Rabagliati, Gambi & Pickering (2016) maintained that it was not yet possible to disentangle two possibilities. One, that children, as we have claimed in this article, are predicting to learn (learning language through linguistic predictions), and the second, that children are learning to predict—that is, prediction is an ability that emerges in expert language users but is not yet developed enough in children (and especially not infants). The recent studies we reviewed in this article represent a major advancement in understanding whether and how children use prediction to learn and how they learn through predictions. These studies led us to formulate a theory of how infants synergistically learn to predict and predict to learn, relying on and adapting their current representations of their native language(s) at multiple levels in a cascading bottom-up and top-down manner.

# 6. Conclusions and future directions

The findings presented in this article underline the tremendous sophistication of early lexical and syntactic acquisition. As proposed by the semantic seed hypothesis, these studies show that by the end of their first year of life, infants can use their blossoming lexicon to learn more about the syntax of their native language (e.g., Babineau & Christophe 2022). This enables them to use newly learned syntactic contexts to guide their inferences about the meaning of novel words (syntactic bootstrapping; Babineau et al. 2021; Barbir et al. 2019). These synergies between lexical and syntactic acquisition are facilitated by children’s distributional/statistical learning skills, notably their ability to keep track of the regularities in their input and their ability to generalize from a small set of exemplars.

Children’s linguistic representations are shown to be flexible such that with increasing experiences with the world, children can not only update the phonological representations of familiar words (e.g., Babineau, Legrand & Shi 2021) or word-to-referent mappings (e.g., Berreti, Havron & Christophe 2020; Dautriche et al. 2018; de Carvalho et al. 2021) but also their syntactic expectations (e.g., Havron et al. 2019, 2021). As demonstrated by Havron et al. (2019, 2021), the predictiveness of a syntactic context can change when the child is presented with convincing evidence from recent input, such as that la petite is more frequently followed by a verb than by a noun (whereas it is more often followed by a noun in French child-directed input). However, when the child is operating with limited experience (with rudimentary lexical and syntactic knowledge), adapting to conflicting information might not yet be possible. This might partly explain why children below the age of 3 have failed to adapt the predictiveness of familiar syntactic contexts in laboratory settings (e.g., Havron et al. 2020).

Taken together, we believe that the route we outline is a plausible theory for early language acquisition. From an initial group of semantic seeds, infants could use their predictive processing skills to learn a handful of syntactic contexts. These syntactic contexts would then help them infer the meaning of novel words, creating a larger and more complex lexicon. As the lexicon grows, so does the reservoir of syntactic contexts infants know and use to predict. At first, infants only rely on very frequent syntactic contexts that make very reliable predictions (such as determiners in French), but as their language develops, they learn to also utilize less reliable syntactic contexts (such as personal pronouns in French and contexts like la petite). Throughout their development, children will also be faced with learning contexts in which they will either need to adapt their syntactic representations and learn something new about syntax from familiar words (e.g. “ko rabbit”) or add new words to their lexicon by relying on the syntactic contexts they have mastered (e.g., “she blicks”). What factors affect this choice is still an open question. One factor we have discussed at length is the reliability of the source of information (i.e., whether the speaker uses syntax vs. semantic reliably), but it is likely that other factors also affect this decision. For example, we would hypothesize that structures that have been more reliable predictors in the past (e.g., determiners as predictors of nouns would be more reliable than pronouns as predictors of verbs) would be less likely to be updated in the face of new evidence. Other factors may be: (i) the reliability of the speaker (e.g., a native speaker might be a more reliable source of information than a nonnative speaker, and an adult might be a more reliable source of information than a child; see e.g., Dautriche et al. 2020, Koenig & Woodward 2010 for evidence that children factor in a speaker’s reliability when updating their lexicon); (ii) the consistency of the new information (whether it was presented only in the course of the experiment or also at home); or (iii) the number of speakers who use it (the more speakers, the more likely the information is correct and generalizable). Future studies should examine these and other factors and their relative weight.

Most of the studies we reviewed in this article were performed on infants and children learning Indo-European languages, especially English and French. Consequently, this article does not differ from the field of language acquisition at large, which is lacking in studies on diverse languages and populations (Kidd & Garcia 2021). We believe one way to move forward is to study other languages that differ from Indo-European languages in their syntactic and morphological properties (see Havron et al. Forthcoming for a recommendation of how our field could do so efficiently).

Perhaps the most important question we leave open is whether young infants can be shown to adapt their predictions and how and when they develop the ability to anticipate what others will say next. As we expanded on, it is likely that infants would be slower to adapt than children and adults, given their more limited cognitive resources. Other, nonmutually exclusive options are that infants cannot yet gauge the reliability of their own representations or the level of noise in the environment or that they need to develop linguistic experience to perform adaptations to their predictions. We would hypothesize that this would be especially true for higher-level predictions such as deciding when to adapt syntactic representations and when to decide to use syntactic representations to learn new words— based on what might be called extralinguistic factors such as speaker reliability. However, more research is needed before we can conclude that infants can or cannot adapt or whether their prediction adaptation relies on factors such as the amount and nature of their linguistic experience. The current review article thus highlights new avenues to investigate the role of prediction in language learning, before and beyond the syntactic bootstrapper.
