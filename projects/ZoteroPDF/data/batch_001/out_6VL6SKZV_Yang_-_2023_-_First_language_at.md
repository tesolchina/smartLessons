# ABSTRACT

In the field of bilingual language development, studies of first language (L1) attrition and second language (L2) attainment have traditionally been two separate streams of research. The present study aims to investigate the L1 and L2 development of Mandarin-speaking immigrants in Hong Kong in depth from the perspective of prosodic focus via a production experiment and a perception one. The data revealed evidence of L1 Mandarin attrition in production but not in perception, and the immigrants were more attuned to acoustic cues than were the native Cantonese speakers. As the existing speech learning models cannot explain our data adequately, we propose a working model (the Bilingual Prosody Transfer Model, or BPTM) to account for the findings and to provide a reference for future work on the prosody of bilingual speakers, the basic claim of which is that prosodic features between an L1 and an L2 can be transferred, even for late L2 learners (sequential bilinguals). The current version of the BPTM only holds for late bilinguals production of prosody; when more data are collected and the postulates are refined, we will extend the BPTM to the perception of prosody by late bilinguals.

In the field of bilingual language development, studies of first language (L1) attrition and second language (L2) attainment have traditionally been two separate streams of research. As an attempt to link L1 attrition and L2 attainment, the present study aims to investigate the language development of Mandarin-speaking immigrants in Hong Kong in depth from the perspective of prosodic focus, which will increase our understanding of the issues involved in L1 and L2 speech interaction. Prosodic focus marks the prominence of an utterance via prosodic means, and it is a phenomenon that is understudied in the research on language acquisition. In this study, a production experiment and a perception one were conducted with native speakers of Mandarin and Cantonese and with Mandarin-speaking immigrants who had learned Cantonese after arriving in Hong Kong and did not speak any Chinese languages other than Mandarin and Cantonese.

In the focus production experiment, the participants answered questions that elicited various types of focus in Mandarin and in Cantonese. The native speakers of Mandarin and Cantonese exhibited differences in the use of acoustic cues in marking focus in their native languages: With regard to verb focus, Mandarin speakers showed pre-, on-, and post-focus changes in fundamental frequency (F0) and intensity, while Cantonese speakers mainly manipulated on-focus changes of duration. The immigrants’ data revealed the bidirectional influences of their L1 and L2, which were reflected in the acoustic measurements when compared to the same metrics for the native speakers. For example, the immigrants marked Cantonese verb focus via pre-, on-, and post-focus manipulations of F0, which was similar to Mandarin speakers but was different from Cantonese speakers, thus suggesting that the immigrants’ L2 Cantonese had undergone assimilation to their native Mandarin in the use of F0.

The design of the focus perception experiment generally followed a recent study of mapping between acoustic cues and focus (Roettger, Mahrt & Cole 2019). The participants were tested on whether they were able to map acoustic cues onto focus and whether they were able to map focus onto acoustic cues. The results of Mandarin focus perception revealed that there were no significant differences between immigrants and native speakers across the focus pairs, thus providing no clear evidence of L1 attrition concerning the mapping of prosody and meaning. With regard to mapping in Cantonese, the immigrants performed better than did the Cantonese speakers across focus pairs, although both groups of speakers exhibited similar patterns in the experiment. The immigrants’ superior performance might have been due to the fact that the immigrants had learned to use F0 and duration in their L1 Mandarin and L2 Cantonese respectively and were thus better at distinguishing the acoustic details than were the native speakers of Cantonese. We propose that bilingualism, particularly regular contact with an L2 that differs from the L1 in terms of prosodic cues, will make bilinguals more sensitive to the acoustic cues and will improve the bilingual speakers’ performance in the perception/processing of prosody.

To recap the results of the two experiments, there was evidence of L1 Mandarin attrition in production but not in perception, and the immigrants were more attuned to acoustic cues than were the native Cantonese speakers. As the existing speech learning models, such as the Revised Speech Learning Model (Flege & Bohn 2021) and the L2 Intonation Learning Theory (Mennen 2015), cannot explain our data adequately, we propose a working model (the Bilingual Prosody Transfer Model, or BPTM) to account for the findings and to provide a reference for future work on the prosody of bilingual speakers, which still requires further testing and refinement. The basic claim of the BPTM is that prosodic features between an L1 and an L2 can be transferred, even for late L2 learners (sequential bilinguals). The initial postulates of the BPTM are presented here:

● Postulate 1: The L1 prosodic system is dynamic and is prone to the influence of L2 prosodic features.   
● Postulate 2: The L1 prosodic system is the basis upon which bilingual speakers establish their L2 prosodic system. Consequently, the L2 prosodic system is likely to exhibit prosodic features that have been transferred from the L1.   
● Postulate 3: The transferability of prosodic features between an L1 and an L2 may depend on acoustic or perceptual differences between the prosodic features of the L1 and the L2. The greater the acoustic or perceptual differences in a prosodic feature between the L1 and the L2, the more likely it is that this feature will be transferred between the L1 and the L2.

Note that these postulates have only been drawn from the data in this study and are therefore far from being conclusive or exhaustive. More investigations are required to determine whether the postulates apply to other language pairs as well as to update and refine the model. The current version of the BPTM only holds for late bilinguals’ production of prosody; when more data are collected and the postulates are refined, we will extend the BPTM to the perception of prosody by late bilinguals.
