This article explores self-mention in L2 (Czech) English-medium master's theses written in the humanities along three dimensions of analysis: realisation, authorial roles and distribution across rhetorical sections. While extending the scope of self-mention to cover nominal forms, the aim of the study is to find out how Czech graduates combine pronominal and nominal self-mention to modulate the degree of visibility and authority they convey in their texts. The contrastive corpusbased investigation compares a corpus of Czech English-medium master's theses with two reference L1 corpora representing learner and published academic discourse to examine differences pertaining to variation along culture, expertise and discipline dimensions. The findings indicate that realisation patterns of self-mention and preferences for specific authorial roles vary significantly across the corpora. Czech graduates tend to be reluctant to display a high degree of visibility and authority, prefer to adopt a stance of humility, and fail to approximate disciplinary patterns of self-mention. The paper argues that this is motivated by the efforts of students to blend L1 and L2 academic conventions, their lower level of rhetorical maturity, and the audience addressed by the students in the examination context of the master's thesis.

# 1. Introduction

In the last three decades, the interactional dimension of academic discourse has attracted considerable attention in research un. dertaken from perspectives of English for academic purposes, intercultural rhetoric and gere analysis The interest in the dialogic and rhetorical character of academic writing has come as a reaction to the traditional view of academic discourse as impersonal and objective, which is rooted in a positivist view of science and reflected in numerous style guides and textbooks for academic writing (Bennett, 2009). As recent research has indicated, when presenting new knowledge and endeavouring to make their claims accepted by readers, academic writers employ an array of means to cast credible self-representation and to establish solidarit with readers by acknowledging their presence and negotiating potential alternative views (e.g. Hyland, 2014; Myers, 1989).

The highly routinised nature of English for academic purposes is undeniably problematic for novice L2 writers. One of the main challenges they face when learning how to write argumentative academic texts isdiscursive construction of an academic identity, which is associated with assumption of various author roles and casting of an authorial presence into the text to claim authority and engage with the audience. Probably the most visible and powerful way of indicating authorial presence is self-mention, r explicit elfreference, typically expresed by first person pronouns (Hyland, 2002). Selfreferece may help students to mark their presece in the text tes ther rle in the reearh roces, take tions and shw familiarity wth ge conventions. tis thrfore oious that the decision to step into the text through the use of explicit self-mention or to opt for an impersonal rhetorical style \*can influence the impression student writers make on their readers and have significant consequences for how their messag i received (yland, 2004, p. 143). This points to a need to study how L2 novice writers at diffrent levels of socialisation in the discursive practices of their individual disciplines employ self-mention to build authorial presence in academic discourse.

The choice of an appropriate level of personalisation is particularly chllenging for novice writers, as writer visibility in Englishmedium academic discourse varies considerably acros specific discourse communities. Previous research has evidenced that the preferred patterns of personalisation vary acros disciplines (e. Bondi, 2014; Dahl, 2004; ltm et al. 2006; Hyland, 2001; Adel, 2022). Another factor likely to affect the rhetorical style that students choose is their original epistemological and literacy tradition. Several studies focusing on cross-cultural variation (e.. Vassileva, 1998; Mur-Duenas, 2007; Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2013; Walkova, 2018) have found that when writing in English, L2 authors from various European linguacultural backgrounds tend to avoid singular first person pronouns and show a preference for plural first person forms or impersonality. Apart from the impact of disciplinary and cross-cultural variation that students encounter in the academic texts that they read, their beliefs about personalisation in academic writing are shaped by teachers intruction and prior learning experience (Lee & Deakin, 2016). As a result of these diverse influences, L2 novice writers discourse typically fails to show the disciplinary variation in self-reference present in published research articles (RAs) (Hyland, 2002) and may be seen as hybrid' or glocal, as it bears signs of the dominant Anglophone academic conventions and of local L2 academic literacies (Mauranen et al., 2010; Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2014).

Previous research into self-mention in learner academic discourse has typically focused on argumentative essays by undergraduate students. Most of these studies report that i terms of frequency, undergraduate students use significantly fewer self-mentions than authors of published research (eg. Hyland, 2002; Ho & Li, 2018), L2 students usuall use fewer first-person pronouns than L1 students (Candarli et a., 2015) and tend to employ we more ften thanI (Leedham, Fenandez-Para, & Parra, 2017), and lower rated 1 and L2 essays use more self-mention than higher rated ones (Lee & Deakin, 2016). It has been found that functions of self-mentions in undergraduate students essays are imited to indcation of text organisation, stating of ams and decription of reearch steps, while more powerful functions with connotations of authority and personal commitment occur carcely (Hyland, 2002; Tang & John, 1999. These features are typically aributed to alack of rhetorical maturity on the part of the student and the very low level of their socialisation into academic literacy practices.

Self-mention in the writing of graduate students has been studied mainly through the example of doctoral theses/disertations e.g. Chen, 2020; Hyland, 2004 trfield & Ravell, 2009, which mark an advanced stage of the socialisation proces that doctoral students undergo in their quest to become legitimate members of specific disciplinary communities. Focusing primarily on the rhetorical functions of self-mentio, theestudie show that even atths advanced eel stdents more often use less owerful athorial rles (Can & Cagir, 2019), tend to underuse or overuse self-mention and, in contrast to experienced writer, are more prone to use of personal pronouns with boosters rather than with hedges (Wang & Zeng, 2021). At the same time, the existence of disciplinary variation in. dicates an awareness of disciplinary conventions (Wang & Jiang, 2018).

However, self-mention in the genre of MTs has received considerably lesscholarly attention, thus leaving a gap in our knowledge about the development of the rhetorical skill of university students between the writing of the undergraduate essay and the doctoral thesis. The master's thesis (MT) is the most sustained and complex piece of academic writing" that graduate students undertake (Swales, 2004, p. 99 at the end of ther universty studies. It i an imortant milestone in the proes of their partil socilisation in the academic writing conventions of their respective disciplines, which shapes them as rhetorical subjects aspiring to participate in production f disciplinary knwledg (f. Samraj, 208). Existing reearch on the genre of the MT typically studie self-mention within a larger group of metadiscourse markers and tends to be primaril frequency oriented (Lee & Casal, 2014; Zhang & Liu, 202 Liu & Zhang, 2022). The finings indicate that the occurrence of elf-mention is les frequent than in published RAs and points to differences in the identities of and level of confidence expressed by graduate students (Samraj, 2008). Of particular interes for my reearch are two studies which compare Chinese master's and doctoral theses: Hyland's (2004) analysis of metadiscourse markers and Chen's (2020) scrutiny of slf-rference devices. While it should be acknowledged that their findings may be culture specific, both studies clearly indicate that there are differences in the way master's and doctoral students employ self-mention: doctoral students are found to use more self-mention markers in an attempt to promote themselves and their contributions (Hyland, 2004); another difference is the higher occurrence of singular and plural personal pronouns, which is combined with a decrease in the incidence of animate (author, writer) and inanimate (thesis study) self-reference noun phrases (Chen, 2020). This call for more fine-grained analyses of the use of self-mention in MTs which would allow us to assist graduate students in developing their abilit to construct a credible authorial presence and enhance the persuasiveness of their theses.

This paper studie self-mention in L2 English-medium MTs writen by Czech graduate students infield of the humanities. It aims to fill several reearch gaps. Firstly it wll study self-mention in L2 English-medium MTs on three dimensions of analysis: realisation, rhetorical functions and distribution. Most studies of elf-mention in graduate students' discourse focus only on one or two dimensions of analysis and fail o consider the istribution of self-mention across the MT. Secondly, it wll consider both pronominal and nominal realisations f slf-mention, an approach applied only by Chen (2020) to Chinese students' texts. Thirdy, it willstudy MTs by Czech graduate students. Self-mention in Czech graduates' academic discourse has not yet been analysed, and there is generally a lack of studies on self-mention in Slavic learner discourse. Finall, realisations of slf-mention will be compared acos three disciplines: linguistics, literary studies and education.

This paper has two main aims. Firtl,I will iestigate the degre of visibility and authority that Czech graduate students convey in their MTs by analysing self-mention on three dimensions: realisation, authorial roles in relation to rhetorical functions and distribution across the rhetorical structure of MTs. Secondly, I aim to contribute to intercultural rhetoric studies by comparing the use of self. mention in Czech students' MTs to the academic discourse of L1 students, and to RAs by L1 authors, in order to identify ierences pertaining to variation in linguacultural background and level of expertise. Thus, this paper combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to answer the following research questions:

1. What are the differences and similaitie in the frequency of use and realisation of self-mention in high-graded English-medium L2 (Czech) MTs, high-graded L1 argumentative essays and 1 published RAs in the fields of linguistc, literary studies and education?   
2. What are the differences and similarities in the author roles expressed by self-mention in English-medium L2 (Czech) MTs, L1 argumentative essays and L1 published RAs?   
3. What are the differences and similarities in the distribution of self-mention across the rhetorical sections of English-medium L2 (Czech) MTs and L1 published RAs?

# 2. Self-mention in academic discourse: dimensions of analysis

Conceived as one of the markers of stance, i. theattitudinal dimension of metadiscourse expressing writers judgements, opinions, and commitments (Hyland, 2005 p. 176) self-mention is not delimited in the same way by al rearchers. Hyland (2005) defines it as comprising exclusive frs-person pronouns (I, me, we, us) and posessives (my, our) deicticall referring to the writer and the less intrusive self-reference phrases the/this author and the/this writer (cf. Adel, 2022). However, some authors (e.g. Bondi, 2014; Chen, 2020) extend the cope f elf-mention to cover inanimate noun phrases (NP) metonymicaly referring to the author (.g. the/thi paper, the/this study, this/th present investigation), termed also abstract rhetors (Hyland, 1998) and metadiscursive object nouns (Hyland & Jiang, 2017). In this study, I wl adopt this wider understanding of the concept and,fllowing Dahl (2004) and Bondi (2014), will lael self-reference with inanimate NPs locational' self-mention. In contrast to other forms of impersonal author reference (e.g. the passive, it-clauses), locational self-mention typically occurs in subject position in active voice clauses. It is characterised by similar self-reference pragmatic functions and semantic sequences as personal self-mention (e.. I/this paper explores) the structure f.., We/this study has shown.. (ondi, 2014). Therfore, the choice between personal and locational forms may be seen as indicative of the degree of visibility and authority that graduate students opt to convey in their MTs.

# 2.1. Realisations of self-mention

The first dimension of analysis considers two basic types of realisations of self-mention - personal pronominal and impersonal nominal. For pronominal self-mention, I adopt the taxonomy suggested by Walkova (2019), which includes three categories:

a) Grammatical subject in the nominative case realised by first-person pronouns I and we, e.g. (1) and $( 2 ) ^ { 1 }$ (1) In this thesis, I will examine second language learners' errors by means of error analysis. (MT_EDU_11)   
b) Possessive pronouns? (or adjectives/determiners) as modifiers of inanimate nouns realised by my and our, e.g. (2): (2) As my analysis shows further on, personal reilience exceeding the oppressive facts of modernisation is an important aspect of all the stories in Once in Europa. (MT_LIT_02)   
c) Other personal pronouns, comprising mainly pronouns in the accusative case (me, us) and rare instances of reflexive pronouns (myself) functioning as object or complements, as in (3): (3) Let me summarize my argument by expanding further on the possible benefits of curricular thinking from three different vantage points. (RA_EDU_09)

Nominal self-mention comprises two sub-categories:

a) NPs directly referring to the author, such as the/this author, the/this writer, used mainly in subject position, as in (4)) (4) The author of this thesis is mindful of the pros and cons of using the e-mail questionnaire to gather qualitative data and is confident that the research method in question will yield valuable information for analysis. (MT_EDU_08)   
b) Locational self-metion relised by NPs such as this thesis, ths paper occurring primarily in subject position, e. (5), and in locative adverbial phrases, e.g. (6), or other patterns, e.g. (7): (5) This paper presents an analysis of two texts which have been chosen as interesting from a pedagogical view. (BAwE_LIN_150) (6) In this thesis similar research on a simpler scale will be conducted with all the corpus speeches and the linguistic and rhetorical levels will be compared. (MT_LIN_01) (7) The aim of this paper is thus to build on these prior analyses in further exploring the role of clams to non-serious intent with respect to (ostensibly) jocular forms of teasing amongst speakers of English. (RA_LIN_06)

The most visible and authoritative realisation of self-mention is pronominal in thematic subject position in active voice clauses as it presents writers as the source of knowledge, opinion or atitudes expressed and enables them to control social interaction with readers (cf. Hyland, 2005). The possesive forms are es authoritative, yet they also indicate overt authorial presence and have the potential 'to promote the writer's contribution by associating them closely with their work" (Hyland, 2001, p. 223). The third category of pronominal self-mention is the least powerful as it tends to present authors as "affected participants rather than active agents" (Walkova, 2019: 63).

Nominal forms of sef-mention reduce writers' visibility. By employing self-reference nouns like the author, authors distance themselves from their claims, opinions and atitudes in an apparent pretence that someone else is constructing the argument. Locational sef-mention shifts the attention from the authors to their work, thus allowing authors to hide' to some extent their authority and visibility (cf. Chen, 2020).

While the realisation types of sef-mention indicate the degree of author visibility that writer claim, they cannot identif on their own the level f thoritiveness writers cs into texts; this is gstd  the collocational and phral pattens of self-mentions and the larger co-text.

# 2.2. Author roles and rhetorical functions

The second dimension of analysis moves from identification of self-mention markers to analysis of their roles and rhetorical function in academic discourse (cf. Adel (2023) on the marker vs the move approach to metadiscourse). The functional cassfication of self-mention used in this study is informed by several taxonomies suggested by previous research (e.g. Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2013; Flottum et al., 2006; Hyland, 2002; Mur-Duenas, 2007; Starfield & Ravelli, 2009; Tang & John, 199. Despit showing umerous siilritie, most f thee taxonmie diffr i the nmber of roles or functions that th idntf, as these may be influenced by the genre, the selected marker (e.g. I or we) and the specificity of the functions identified.

My classification takes into consideration the context, the location of the personal structure within the rhetorical structure of the text and the semantic-pragmatic meaning of the verb with which the personal expressions occur (cf. Flottum et al., 2006; Hyland, 1999 as indicative of their role in writer-rader interaction. It comprises five role of slf-mention which may be seen as clusters of rhetorical functions. They include:

1) the discourse organiser role, often expressed by the co-occurrence of self-mention and discourse verbs such as iscuss present summarize, focus on, as in (8) and (9): a) at the global level, it performs two rhetorical functions: - stating a goal or purpose - outlining the structure of the text

(8) In this essay I willexamine what Kachru would describe as the outer circle English of Hong Kong. (BAwE_LIN_166) b) at local level, the rhetorical functions performed are: - indication of rhetorical moves - signalling of transition points in discourse making of intra-textual connections

(9) Swenson points out that these details imply the identification of "virgin author and Virgin Mary .. book and baby, identif. cations supported by further references to Mary in Poems Referring to the Times" that I discuss below. (RA_LIT_04)

2) the researcher role,commonly signalled by the co-occurrence of self-mention and research and cognition verbs such as analyse, find, use, understand, e.g. (10), which is associated with:

- describing data and data collection   
- explaining procedure   
- stating a hypothesis or expectations   
- presenting and interpreting results   
- commenting on strengths and limitations of the research

(10) The sixth error source I used in order to classfy the errors found in the learner corpus was exploitation of redundancy under which many article errors were included. (MT_EDU_08)

) the arguer role, typically manifested by the co-occurrence of self-mention and position verbs such as argue, claim, dispute, show. e.g. (11), which performs the functions of: - elaborating arguments - putting forward claims - commenting on findings

11) We have argued that Cherry creates contrasting discourses of, on the one hand, positive presentation of the members of the ingroup and, on the other hand, negative presentation of the members of the out-group. (MT_LIN_03)

4) the evaluator role, commonly realised by the co-occurrence of self-mention and evaluative and emotive verbs such as feel, ind something followed by an evaluative adjective, e.g. (12), which is used for: - expressing agreement or disagreement with an issue, position or belief - expressing an attitude

(12) Although I am in a minorit, I find some of Poems and Ballads (1866) almost impossible to read. (RA_LIT_11)

(5) the reflexive-self role, which conveys the situatednes of the researcher and casts his/her autobiographical elf into the text (cf. Starfield & Ravell, 2009). This role encompasses Hyland's (2002) self-beneficiary function typical of student writing, but has a wider scope, which makes it applicable to any kind of academic discourse, by e.g. (13):

- providing personal comments related to the design and realisation of the study   
- describing the teaching or research experience of the author   
explaining the reasons for undertaking the study   
- describing personal benefits from the study

(13) At the time I was supposed to choose a topic for my thesis, I had only a very vague dea of what I wanted to research. (MT _LIT_11)

The rhetorical role and functions of slf-mention are indicative primarily of the way writer-reader interaction is constructed at the local level of discourse.

# 2.3. Distribution across rhetorical sections

The third dimension of analysis considers the distribution of self-mention at the global level of discourse, i.e. along the rhetorical sections of the text, and was explored acrossthe MT and the RA LLE corpora. This dimension is important, ecause some rhetorical functions are associated with specific sections. In addition, the occurrence of self-mention in diffrent rhetorical sections has been found to show cross-cultural variation (cf. Mur-Duenas, 2007). Finall, ratios of pronominal and nominal self-mention are likely to vary across cultures and levels of expertise.

The first two dimensions of analysis described above were applied to investigation of the degree of visibility and authority conveyed in Czech graduates' MTs and their comparison to published RAs and students'essays by L1 writers. The third dimension was explored only across the MT and RA LLE corpora as argumentative essays differ in length and rhetorica structure from reearch work.

# 3. Data and method

# 3.1. 1. corpus

This analysis of self-mention in L2 academic discourse is performed on a specialised learner corpus of English-medium master's degree theses (MT corpus) written by Czech university graduate students majoring in English Language and Literature at the Faculty of Arts or the Faculty of Education at Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, in the period 2010-2018. For purposes of croscultural comparison, it has en verified that the L1 of all thesis authors is Czech. To ensure comparability with the BAwE corpus, which includes only high-graded theses, the MT selection was restricted to theses graded A (Excellent/Merit). The MT corpus comprises 48 MTs representing thre disciplines corresponding to the areas in which students enrolled in the English Language and Literature graduate programme write their MTs: ingusics, iterature studies, and education (16 theses per discipline). It totals 948,000 wors a all the texts wee cea/ofie for uro of the prt std, i. l citations, ple, tabe, charts and references were eliminated; hence only the author's own discourse was subjected to linguistic analysis. The linguistics and education theses typically display a traditional structure including Introduction, Theoretical Background, Results & Discusson and Conclusion sections, whil the iterature theses are split between the traditional type and a topic-based structure comprising Introduction, Theo retical Background, Topic1, Topic2, Topic3 etc. and Conclusionsections cf.Palridge & Starfield, 2007). Description of methods and data tends to be included in the Theoretical Background section, which encompasses general theoretical considerations and a review of previous research. In topic-based theses the Theoretical Background section is relatively short as it presents the general theoretical foundations of the thesis, while topic-related ssues are discussed in the subsequent chapters. This diffrence in rhetorical structure does not seem to affect significantly the distribution of self-mention across the rhetorical sections of the MTs in the MT corpus.

The study used two reference corpora representing L1 English academic discourse at diffrent stages of development of authorial identity, i. learner and publishing authors' discourse, to allow for comparison along the linguacultural and expertise dimensions. Since to the best of my knowledge there i no 1 MTs corpus representing the target disciline, and I was not able to self-compile such a corpus due to problems of access a selection from the British Academic Writen English Corpus (BAwE LLC) was used as areference learner corpus for exploration of variation across inguacultural backgrounds (L1 British-English writers vs L2 Czech writers). The second reference corpus is the Research Articles Corpus (RA LLE), which includes RAs by Anglophone authors (judging from their names, CVs and affiliations), intended for comparison along the expertise dimension. Thus, the two reference corpora represent different genres of academic writing: similarly to the MT, the RAs i a research-based genre, while BAWE essays are argumentative in nature. To ensure their comparability in accordance with the principles of tertium comparatinis (Connor & Moreno, 2005), the criteria applied in compilation of the reference corpora were the same as or maximally similar to those aplied in the compilation of the MT corpus.

The BAWE corpus comprises assignments written by university students in Britain in the period 2004-2007 graded Merit' and Distinction', i.e. similarly to the MT corpus, it includes high-graded learner texts. Only argumentative essays with an average wordcount f 2500 words per essay written by students whose L1 is English were selected. The BAWE Corpus Manual defines the genre family of the essay as argumentative texts which may take the form of discussion, exposition, factorial, challenge, comparison, or commentary and "may correspond to a published academic/specialist paper' (p. 47). To ensure maximum comparability between the MT corpus and the learner reference corpus, a BAWE-LLC sub-corpus was compiled which comprises 197 argumentative essays in the disciplinary group Arts and Humanities, so representing similar discilines as in the MT corpus. Since BAWE comprises no essays in the field of education, the disciplines selected were linguisic, English litrature and comparative American studies. hus, the BAwE_LLC corpus may be seen as "an 'analogue corpus, i.e. acorpus which is as near as possible in terms of genre and discipline' (Flowerdew, 2015; Tribble, 2002) to the MT corpus. The rference BAwE_LC sub-corpus totals 491,00 words afer the same procedure of cleaning was applied as with the MT corpus.

The self-compiled RA LLE corpus includes single-authored RAs by Anglophone scholars published in highly influential academic journals representing the same fields as were included in the MT corpus, namely Discourse & Communication, Jounal f Pragmatics and Applied Linguistic in the field of inguisic, ghtenth-Centy Fiction, New Liteary History and SEL.: Stdies in English Litratre in the field of litrature, and Language and Education Language Teaching Reserch and Language Leaning in the feld of education. The specfic journals were selected from a list of journals provided by teachers involved in the English Language and Literature programme to reflect titles they recommend to their students. While it is obvious that \*thes diffr from RAs in their purpose, scale, intended audience and requirements to be met (Flowerdew, 2015, p. 60; Paltridge, 2002), it can be argued that they show \*signficant areas of overlap in lexico-grammar and rhetorical functions" (Flowerdew, 2015, p. 60), which substantiates the use of theRA _LE as a reference corpus in this study. The RA LLE corus comprises 36 texts (12 per discipline) which have undergone the same procedure of cleaning as the MT corpus, so that its size totals 243,000 words.

Table 1 summarises the composition and size of the learner MT corpus and the two reference corpora.

All corpora were built with the use of SketchEngine software (Kilgarrf et al., 2004), which automaticlly tags and lemmatises texts. The discrepancy in wordcount between the three corpora was resolved by normalisation to occurrences per 10,000 words (ptw). I am aware that the difference in genre and size between the three corpora may affect the results, but I believe that self-mention is not particularly length-sensitive as t i associated with performance of specific functions in rhetorical moves irespective of their size. Despite these limitations, the genre selected and the sie of the corpora appear suficient to draw some conclusions for verification by future investigation. It should also be pointed out that the aim of this analysis is primarily to indicate learner language features appearing in the MT corpus rather than to provide a full-fledged comparison between the MT, BAWE-LLC and RA LLE corpora.

# 3.2. Procedure

The corpora were searched with the SketchEngine corpus tool for occurrences of pronominal and nominal slf-mention. Allpronominal occurrences were checked in context manually to resolve the ambiguity of plural forms Harwood, 2005); only pronominal forms referring to the author were selected for analysis. The locational sub-type of nominal slf-mention was restricted to the most frequent discourse and research nouns (the lowest scoring 0.16 hits pttw) (cf. Bondi, 2014), four of which appeared in all corpora, i. section, stdy, nis, rerch, while the thrs wre re-spific, .. tis, work, part  chter in th corus, r and article in the RA_LLE corpus, and essay, paper and part in the BAWE_LLC corpus.

Alloccurrences of self-mention were coded according to the taxonomy of realisations of self-mention and the classification of author roles as presented in Section 2 above. Since the pragmatic functions of personal pronouns vary in context, cases of multifunctionality were resolved by assgning self-mention structures to the most prominent author role expressed (cf. Walkova, 2019). Occurrences f realisation types and author roles were compared across the three corpora, whil variation in realisations acrossthe three disciplines was studied i the MT and RA LLE corpora. Finall, the distribution of self-mention crossthe sections of MTs and RAs was compared. BAWE argumentative essays were excluded from the cross-disciplinary comparison and the comparison of the dis tribution of self-mention acros rhetorical sections, as the disciplines they represent and their global rhetorical structure are similar to but slightly different from the texts included in the MT and RA_LLE corpora, and so they would not yeld informative results.

The statistical ignificance of differences was established by using the non-parametric log-likelihood statistical test (Rayson et al., 2004); this is in line withcurrent practice in the analysis of specialised corpora, where we cannot assume a normal distribution of features. The significance level was set at the standard value of ${ < } 0 . 0 5$ (very low p-values are represented as ${ \it < } 0 . 0 0 1 { \it \Omega }$

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Frequency and realisations of self-mention

Overall, the results of the quantitative analysis of self-mention markers in the thre corpora as summarised in Table 2 show that the difference in their occurrence is significant across the learner MT and BAWE_LLC corpora (LL test; p-value ${ \it < } 0 . 0 0 1$ ) and not significant across the MT and the RA LLE corpora (LL test; p-value 0.07). This seems to indicate that the high frequency f slf-mention may be a distinctive feature of research-based genres, such as the MT and the MA. The argumentative nature of essys is likely to explain the lower frequency of self-mention in the BAWE_LLC corpus.

However, tendencies in the use of pronominal and nominal self-mention are strikingly different and seem to highlight differences along the cultural and expertise dimensions (see Table 3). Pronominal self-mention i significantly more frequent in the RALE orpus than in both learner corpora (MT corpus, LL test, $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; BAWE_LLC corpus, LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ . This suggests that Anglophone scholars are prone to opt for greater explicit visibility to claim authority and highlight their contribution to disciplinary knowledge. The low use of sef-mention in learner discourse concurs with the findings of previous research, which report that students seem to be reluctant to expres ful commitment to their views and claims (.g. Hyland, 2002, 2004), and that L2 students, especially those from in-group oriented backgrounds (such as the zech case in point), tend to underuse ronominal self-mention (e.g. Lee & Deakin, 2016; Liu & Zhang, 2022). In the case of Cech graduate students, underuse of pronominal forms may also be afected by writing instruction that discourages personality and the writing style of Czech soft sciences scholars publishing in English, which is characterised by low occurrence of self-mention (cf. Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2013, Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2014). Another factor may be the Czech academic literacy in the field of humanities, where personality isfrequent. However, as with other pro-drop languages such as Slovak. personality in Cech is typically marked by verbal endings and not by personal pronouns in subject position, which makes it seem les obtrusive (cf. Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2020; Walkova, 2019).

In contrast nominal self-mention is most prominent in the MT corpus (26.0), where itis significantly higher than in the RA LLE and the BAWE_LLC corpora (RA_LLE corpus, LL test, $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; BAWE_LLC corpus, LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ . Fig. 1 shows the ratio of pronominal and nominal self-mention across the corpora. In both L1 corpora the ratio of pronominal self-mention $( 5 4 . 8 \%$ in the RA_LLE corpus and $7 7 . 5 \%$ in the BAWE_LLC corpus) exceeds that of nominal self-mention, while the MT corpus shows the highest percentage of nominal self-mention $( 6 9 . 1 \% )$ . This clearly indicates cross-cultural variation. The low proportion of nominal forms in the BAwE_LLC corpus may be atriutd to the armentative nature ofthe genre, charactried y esexplicit text structure and scarce reference to reearch design and data, as well as to the lower level of socialisation of student writers in the academic community. By overusing nominal self mention, Czech graduate students show a strong preference for stepping into the text while hidden' behind noun phrases referrig directly or metonymically to the write, thus reducing their visibilit, authorit and agentive role in the research. While his may be faithful tothe tradition in Czech and other Central European academic dscourses of showing modest and politenes (cf. Cmejrkova & Danes, 1997), the reduced lel of explicit slf-mention is likely to affect ngatively the persuasivenessof Czech students texts. It is therefore esential to raise awareness in Czech graduate of the full rhetorical potential of nominal and pronominal sef-mention in order to asst them in the building of a credible persona and enhancement of the persuasivenesof their discourse.

Closer scrutiny of the different types of realisations of self-mention reveals further differences acros the corpora. Within pronominal sef-mention, the use of first-peron pronouns in the powerful thematic subject position iscearly the most frequent type. The rate of this realisation type is similar in the two leaner corpora, but it isignificantly more prominent in the RA LLE corpus (MT corpus, LL test, $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; BAWE_LLC corpus, LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ , as Anglophone scholars enhance their visibility in order to represent themselves s credible researchers committed to their clams and views. In the BAE LLC corpus this position i ocupied exclusively by I, whil only one article in the RA LLE corpus uses theexclusive we referring to the universty team of which the author i a member. This indicates that first-eson singular pronouns may be seen as the preferred paten of personalistio in inguistc, litrary studies and education. In the MT corpus, however, five theses (3 LING and 2 EDU) use the exclusive we (14), so amounting to 8 per cen f al occurrences of pronouns in subject position. This may be attributed to transference from the Cch academic literacy, which in the case of personal self-mention shows a strong preference for use of exclusive first-person plural forms (Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2020; Cmejrkova & Danes, 1997).

(14) In the theoretical part f the theis, we have first described the concepts of individual and collectie dentities andwe pointed out that they are fluid and dynamic phenomena and they are discursively constructed according to contextual setting. (MT_LIN_03)

As with pronominal subjects, possessives are most prominent i the RA LLE corpus (4.2) showing that writers of RAs fee a strong connection with their data, reearch methods, findings and interretations (e.g. my experience, my analysis, my data, my question, my purpose, my understanding). Despite the significant diffrence in the frequency of use of possessives in the RA LLE and the MT corpora (LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ , Czech graduate students use possessives in a similar way, although with slightly different collocation patterns comprising primarily discourse and research-related nouns (e.g. my thesis, my stud, my research, my analysis, my data, my opinion). The BAWE_LLC corpus shows a very low frequency of possessives, probably because argumentative essays tend to express the author's opinions rather than report research. The last form of pronominal self-mention (me/us is the least frequent in all corpora. The major difference here sems to be the usef the phrae lt me. This patern, typicall indicating a transition point in the discourse, constutes nearly half foccurrences of this tye of elf-mention in theT orpus, while it ds not ocur atall n th corpora. Cch raduates aware of the fact that Anglophone academic writing conventions require explicit text organisation and reader awareness may tend to use set phrases to achieve this effect in their theses.

Fig. 1. Pronominal and nominal self-mention across the corpora (in per cent).

As to nominal elf-mention, the first ignificant difference is the lack of self-refernceNPs in the 1 corpora. In conrast, in the MT corpus the self-reference NP the author of ths thsis occurs 298 times in ten theses, typically in subject position. This constitutes 8 per cent f ll self-mentions, which is considerably less than the 40 per cent ratio found by Chen (2020) in his Chinese graduates' MTs corpus. OCcasional use of the author in Anglophone published RAs is reported by Adel (2022) in a corpus representing the fields of linguistics ltey studes and hisry. It may therfore be concludd that the use of self-ference Ps is typial in lener discourse, but rather rare in published discourse. The preference of Czech graduates for shifing atention from themseles to their work is also indicated by a significant overuse of locational self-mention, which is not present the L1 corpora (RA LLE: LL test, $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ BAWE_LLC: LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ . This is typically expressed by discourse NPs, e.g. thesis (561 occurrences), chapter (626) and section (227). It may be argued that Czech students consider the use of discourse NPs as a safe and convenient way to cast their implicit presence into the text when stating goals, organising discourse, making claims and reporting findings. This may be due to the exam context in which the MT is situated. The primary audience of the MT are examiners, and it is perhaps natural that in the context of unequal power distribution, the examinees prefer to adopt a more distant stance implying modesty and politeness considerations.

A comparison of elf-mention choices across the three disciplines in the MT and the RA LLE corpora reveals disciplinary variation (Table 4). Disciplinary differences are significant acros all three disciplines in the RA_LLE corpus (LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ in terms of overal frequency of elf-mention (LIN 56.6, LIT 20.2 and EDU 28.7), as well as comparison of pronominal (LIN 29.9, LIT 16.6 and EDU 11.2) and nominal (LIN 279, LIT 3.6 and EDU 17.5 self-mention, which supports the findings of previous cos-disciplinary research (e.g. Hyland, 001; Adel, 2022). In the MT corus, however, the differences are not so prominent, as variation in overal frequency of self-mention (46.0 vs 47.3; LL test, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 5 3 \mathrm { , }$ and in nominal self-mention (35.3 vs 33.4; LL test, ${ \tt p } = 0 . 1 8 $ across the MT_LIN and MT EDU corpus is not significant. A tendency towards ess pronounced disciplinary variation in L2 academic discourse has also been evidenced by Adel (2022). The blurring of disciplinary boundaries in learner discourse may be the result of academic writing in. structions, which ofte fail to explain disciplinary specificities, as well as by the lower level of expertise of graduat writers, who are just beginning their socialisation in specific disciplinary discourse communities.

A comparison of the frequency of realisation types by discipline across the MT and RA_LE corpora indicates further differences in the way learners and publishing scholars use self-mention. The overal frequency of self-mention shows significant variation i the LIN (MT 46.0 vs RA 56.6) and EDU (MT 47.3 vs RA_LLE 28.7) sub-corpora (LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ . However, the differences in the LIT subcorpora seem insignificant (LL test, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 4 1 $ . This results from compensation for significant underuse of pronominal self-mention in the MT_LIT sub-corpus $ { \mathrm { ( M T } } 8 . 2$ vs RA_LLE 16.6; LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ) by significant overuse of nominal self-mention (MT 10.6.6 vs RA_LLE 3.6; LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ). In the LIN sub-corpora, the divergence in pronominal self-mention is even more significant (MT 10.6 vs RA 29.9; LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ , but the difference in nominal self-mention, though considerable (MT 35.4 vs RA_LLE 26.7), is not statistically significant (LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 6 \} } \end{array}$ . Finally, education theses significantly overuse all types of self-mention (MT 47.3 vs RA_LLE 10.6, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ , which is surprising. These results suggest that despite receiving similar academic writing instructions, students have some implicit awarenessof isciplinary variation through thir reading. However, thir elf-mention choices are also affected by their efforts to blend the L1 literacy tradition with Anglophone writing conventions, personal preferences and, very likely, supervisors advice. As a result, the visibility and authorit graduates are willing to display in their discourse vary and mostly fail to approximate the disciplinary patterns typical of published research.

# 4.2. The rhetorical dimension of self-mention: authorial roles and functions

An examination of the authorial roles Czech students assume in their MTs provides further insight into the degree of visibility and authority graduates project in their discourse. As Fig. 2 shows, the prominence of individual authorial roles varies across the three corpora. Fig. 3a, b and 3c compare the use of pronominal and nominal forms of elf-mention performing authorial role in the three corpora.

At the global level, which is associated with the rhetorical functions of stating aims and goals and outlining text structure, the discourse organiser role shows no significant variation across the corpora (LL test, $\mathfrak { p } > 0 . 5 \}$ . This is not surprising because a statement of aims and an outline of text structure in the introduction section are required by genre conventions. However, authorial visibility differs along the expertise dimension since publishing authors tend to use more pronominal self-mentio, while leaners employ more nominal self-mention.

At the local level, the discourse organiser role is significantly more frequent in MTs (LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ . This seems to stem primarly from diffe in tet sie, atough t as indict tht ch a ri tht the xtive lgth of the mststesis requires use of cross-rferences and explicit indication of transition points, which enhance reader-friendiness in their discourse. The extensive use of the discourse organiser role marks an important step in Czech graduates academic writing development, as Czech academic discourse is mostly characterised by a lack of explicitnes, focus and textual signposting (cf. Cmejrkova & Danes, 1997).

The researcher role is more authoritative as itallows writers to show their agentive role in the research process It is similarly prominent in the MT and RA_LLE corpora (LL test, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 3 7 \mathrm { , }$ , but significantly less frequent in the BAWE_LLC corpus (LL test, $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { p } } <$ 0.001). An examination of the specific rhetorical functions conveyed indicates some differences between the MT and the RA LLE corpora. Whereas methods sections in RA LLE are typically condensed, MTs tend to use extended descriptions of methods (Swales & Feak, 2012), indicated, among other things, by the frequent occurrence of the pattern I decided to (15), which is absent in the RA LLE and BAwE_LLC corpora. Use of an extended methods section may be motivated by the exam situation and the need to justify the appropriateness of procedures. The choice f pronominal form of self-mention increases authorial visbility and explicitl atributes the procedural decision to the writer, thus also claiming authority and responsibility for the choices made.

(15) In the end, I decided to use only the spelling error category because all compositions were andwritten, so the typo subcategory was irrelevant. (MT_EDU_11)

The rhetorical functions presenting and interpreting results', which allow writers to highlight their contrbution to disciplinary knowledge, are employed with similar frequency in the MT and RA_LLE corpora. However, the most prominent verbal collocates of self-mention dffer slightly across the two corpora. Experienced 1 authors typically use pronominal forms and research and cognitive verbs, e.g. conduct, examine and consider, while Czech graduates use mostly nominal forms and discourse and research verbs, e.g. discuss resent, provide, del and explore. Another difference is the lesser occurrence of the commenting on strengths and limitations moves in the MT corpus. This may be related to the examination context of the MT, in which students seem shy to promote their contributions and avoid pointing to limitations so as not to undermine their prospects of success at the examination.

Fig. 3c. Authorial roles of pronominal and nominal self-mention in the RA_LLE corpus.

The two most powerful functions - arguer and evaluator - show the same tendency: they are significantly more prominent in the RA_LLE corpus than in the learner corpora (LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ , indicating variation along the expertise dimension. Author visibility in the learner corpora i also backgrounded by a preference for nominal self-mentions, which may be motivated by a lack of rhetorical maturity and an effort to enhance objectivity and display humility in front of examiners. Another reason may be that the educational context, which is not as competitive as in international academia, does not require intensive self-promotion. In the case of Czech graduates, the preference for a lower level ofvisbility may stem from pattens of interaction in the Czech academic community which are marked by symbiosis and avoidance of tension (Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2014).

The last self-reflexive role is the only one significantly more prominent in the MT corpus (LL test, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ , which is not surprising at it is generally considered to be more typical of learner discourse (cf. Hyland, 2002, Walkova, 2019). It appears primarily in the Introduction section, where zech graduates explain the motivation for their choice f topic, and in the Conclusion section, where they highlight personal benefits gleaned from the project. In the RA corpus this role typically refers to the teaching or revious researcher experience of the writer. Although not as authoritative as the arguer and evaluator roles, the self-reflexive role contributes to writer visibility and gives the text a personal touch.

Overall similarities in rhetorical functions across the corpora indicate that Czech graduates have an awareness of genre conventions and the general norms of Anglophone academic writing. The differences are likel to reflect cros-culturaldifferences, the students lower level of socialisation in the academic discourse community and the specificit of the examination context in which the MT is set.

# 4.3. Distribution of self-mention across rhetorical sections

The last dimension of analysis i the distribution of self-mention at the global level of text. Figs. 4 and 5 show the distribution of self. mention across the rhetorical sections of MTs and RAs. In both corpora, self-mention shows the same tendency to peak in the Results and Discussion section, where authors typically expresthe highly prominent roles of researcher and discourse organiser. In the Conclusion sectio, associated with the role f arguer and evaluator, the occrrencef self-mention is the lowest The distribution of pronominal and nominal form in these sections is also similar, with the pronominal prevailing in RAs and the nominal in MTs. Dif ferences can be seen in the Introduction section, where self-mention is more prominent in RAs, most likely because scholars who publish in the highly competitive international context tend to enhance their visibility when indicating and occupying a research niche. In contrast, MT authors prefer to use nominal self-mention when stating the aims of their study. Since the Data and Method section in RAs differsin length and content from the Theoretical background in MTs, it i hardy surprising that they show considerable difference in terms of elf-mention. Theoretical Background sections make more extensive use of predominantly nominal elf-mention this may be related to specifying theories, approaches and data processing techniques used in the thesis in order o convince examiners that the student is familiar with disciplinary knowledge. The use of pronominal self-mention in these sections is very similar cross the two corpora (2.9 vs 3.0), but the difference in nominal forms is substantial (8.0 vs 3.6), although Method is the only RA section in which the rate of nominal forms exceeds that of pronominal ones.

While the distribution of slf-mention across the T corpus indicates awareness on the part of Czech students of the conventions of the MT gere, it also indicates their rhetorical immaturity. This is suggested by a ratiof nominal and pronominal self-mention which is similar across al sections of MTs, with nominal slf-mention showing more than twice as many instances as pronominal elfmention. In contrast, in RAs the ratio varies and tends to be more balanced, indicating that experienced scholars accommodate rhetorical choices to their persuasive aims. This sugests that even after completing the writing of their MTs graduates are till novice academic writers who need to develop their rhetorical sills in English-medium academic discourse if they wish to pursue an academic career.

# 5. Conclusion

This article has explored self-mention in L2 learner academic discourse along three dimensions of analysis realisation, authorial roles and disribution acrossthe rhetorica sections of English-medium MTs. Inso doing, it has combined the potential of the marker and move' approaches to metadiscourse (Adel, 2023, p. 6) to investigate the degree of visibility and authority that Czech graduates convey in their txs. Another contribution of his study is the extension of the scope of elf-mention to cover pronominal and nominal forms. The contrastive corpus-based investigation has compared a corpus of high-graded Czech graduates MTs to two reference L1 corpora representing learner and published academic discourse to examine diferences pertaining to variation along culture and expertise dimensions. The findings indicate that realisation patterns of self-mention and preferences for specific authorial roles vary significantly acrosthe corpora. Czech graduates, who are at the intial stage of their socialisation in the (English-medium) academic discourse communit, tend tobe reluctant to display a high degre of visility and authority and prefer to adopt a stance of humility in their English-medium theses. I argue that the most likely reasons for this are mixing of Czech and Anglophone academic conventions, complemented by Czech graduates' novice-writer status and the audience addressed in the examination context of the MT.

More specificall, my findings show that in comparison to L1 expert and leaner writers Czech students underuse pronominal self mention and overuse nominal self-mention. This difference from 1 academic writing conventions may reflect the students' efforts to find a balance between the ned to clam crdibilit and to press umilit. n addtion, when developing ther writer identitie, Czech learners experience the influence of an 1 academic literacy that proritises i-groupness and modesty as well as Anglophone academic conventions favouring a higher degree of authorial visility. As a result Czech students discourse bears marks of hybridisation typical of most L2 English-medium academic discourses. On the global level of rhetorical structure, Czech graduates show an awarenessof genre conventions, not only by the distribution of sef-mention across the rhetorical sections of the text, but also by the presence of disciplinary variation. Yet Czech learners' self-mention choices diverge from disciplinary patterns in published RAs, revealing the impact of general English academic writing instruction and the limitations of implicit knowledge gathered from reading academic texts.  prefrce for ls owerul thril les sugts that, simily t lner writers, c stds are rluctant o assume an authoritative tance, which ems o reflect ther novice authorial status and differences between the gres under consideration. In addition, this may be rlated to a degree of competitiveness in the educational setting that is lower than that which obtains in international academia, and an examination context in which humility may be seen as a useful social value.

To conclude, the findings of this study have evidenced that the MT marks a distinct stage in the development of L2 students as academic writers and therefore needs to be further explored. The intricate relations between the students original literacy and Anglophone writing conventions suggest that we need more research to reveal how different linguacultural backgrounds affect the process of socialisation of graduate students in order to prepare beter for development of their nglish-language rhetorical kills This study may have implications for the design of materials and resources that can be used in universty writing courses to draw the attention of graduate students to specific ways in which sef-mention is used in discilinary and cultural contexts. Understanding how self-mention i used may ast them in making informed choices to ehance the persuasivenes of their dscourse. However, the results of this investigation cannot be overgeneralised, as they take into consideration only one L2 linguacultural background, high-graded theses and a limited set of disciplines. They should be verified by larger-scale studies combining corpus and rhetorical analysis of self-mention with investigation of students' motivation for choosing specific degree f visibility and authorit in high-graded and lower-graded English-medium theses.
