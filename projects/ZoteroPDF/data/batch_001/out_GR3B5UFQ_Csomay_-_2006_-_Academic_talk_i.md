# Abstract

“Is academic speech ‘more like’ casual conversation or academic writing?” [Swales, J. (2001). Metatalk in American academic talk. The cases of ‘point’ and ‘thing’. Journal of English Language, 29(1), p. 37]. Taking a corpus-based perspective to the analysis, this study compares the language of university classroom talk to academic prose and face-to-face conversation, positioning university classroom talk on the language continuum of speech and writing. More specifically, looking at a large number of linguistic features working together, I describe the language of 196 university class sessions (1.4 million words) collected at six universities across the United States. The analysis is based on Biber’s multi-dimensional analytical framework [Biber, D. (1988). Variation across speech and writing. New York: Cambridge University Press]. Overall, the results indicate that in these classrooms language features associated with both informational focus (as in academic prose) and involved discourse (as in face-to-face conversation) are equally present. Hence, this evidence-based research supports the argument that North American university classrooms exhibit language that can be treated as an interface on an oral–literate continuum.

# 1. Background

With the rise of new perspectives on contextualized language use, English for Specific Purposes (ESP) has been in the focus of applied linguistic studies for the past few decades. One area of ESP, English for Academic Purposes (EAP) has become one of the most intensively investigated areas in recent applied linguistic research. Although considerable attention has been given to written discourse, researching spoken academic discourse has also come to the forefront. With the availability of large collections of texts, the number of corpus-based studies that examine patterns of language use in university classroom talk has grown as well.

In terms of written academic discourse, the various schools of studies have focused on multiple aspects of academic prose. For example, Swales (1990) looks at typical rhetorical patterns and Hyland (1998) investigates the linguistic correlates of hedging in research articles. Grabe and Kaplan (1996) develop a theory of second language writing and suggest ways to teach academic writing to an international audience while Johns (1997) discusses the teaching of academic literacy for successful university studies in the United States. Most recently, Hyland (2003) introduces second language writing theories, practice and research to teachers in training.

Another group of scholars use corpus-based approaches to focus on the lexico-grammatical characteristics of academic prose, and find differences across disciplines. As an example, Biber (1988, 1995) and Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, and Finegan (1999) shed light on the linguistic features of academic prose in comparison to other, non-academic spoken and written registers. Conrad (1996) compares professional texts in two diverse academic disciplinary areas (history and biology) and shows differences in the “use of narration, overt argumentation, and impersonal style” (p. 257) in the two disciplines. Hyland (2002) points to disciplinary differences in the use and the role of interpretation of directives in a corpus of research articles from the ‘soft’ and from the ‘hard’ sciences.

Although academic prose has been widely investigated, comparatively few studies have dealt with academic spoken discourse. Perhaps due to the fact that academic lectures have a “central educational role in many universities” (Swales, 2001, p. 34), in earlier research, they were viewed as the single most important spoken register in the academic context. Hence, with only a few exceptions, studies of the 1980s and 1990s almost exclusively focused on lectures. As Waters (1996) points out, the primary motivation for these studies was to help second language learners who may have difficulties understanding academic speech, and the linguistic analyses focused mostly on the lexical-, topical- and discourse patterns of lectures (Chaudron & Richards, 1986; DeCarrico & Nattinger, 1988; Dudley-Evans, 1994; Hansen, 1994; Nattinger & DeCarrico, 1992; Olsen & Huckin, 1990; Strodt-Lopez, 1993; Young, 1994). This research prompted materials development on, for example, note-taking (e.g. Ruetten, 1986; Young & Fitzgerald, 1982).

Recent studies provide comprehensive linguistic descriptions of large collections of multiple (sub)registers found in the academic context, including study groups, lab sessions, service encounters, and office hours (Biber, Conrad, Reppen, Byrd, & Helt, 2002). Others give detailed descriptions of one single register such as Farr’s (2002) analysis of study groups. Most recently, corpus linguistic research into language use specific to university classrooms has emerged with the on-line availability of the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE). MICASE is composed of various types of classroom discourse, from monologic lecture type classes to interactive class sessions (cf., description of corpus in Simpson & Swales, 2001). Scholars have investigated the use of reflexivity (Mauranen, 2001), the use and functions of evaluative adjectives (Swales & Burke, 2003) and pronouns (Fortanet, 2004), and the kinds of idioms used in the classroom (Simpson & Mendis, 2003). Investigations on MICASE classrooms extend to identifications of discourse markers signaling new episodes (Swales & Malczewski, 2001) or to comparisons of discourse markers in MICASE to those in another corpus of guest lectures (Crawford Camiciottoli, 2004). Along with the reports on MICASE research, their constantly updated homepage also contains research-based ESL/EAP teaching and self-study materials (http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eli/micase/index.htm). Another group of scholars use the classroom sub-corpus of the TOEFL 2000 academic corpus (Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; Biber, Conrad, Reppen, Byrd, Helt, Clark, Cortes, Csomay & Urzua 2004; Biber et al., 2002) for various types of research, for instance examining linguistic variation across class sessions (Csomay, 2002).

In sum, many different types of studies have been carried out to characterize the language used in the academic context. New technologies and large collections of texts promote detailed linguistic analyses of particular features of academic lectures. What is missing in these studies, however, is a broad linguistic description of university classroom discourse. This study attempts to partially fill this gap by comparing the situational and linguistic features of university classroom talk to academic prose and face-to-face conversation. A situational characterization of this context is provided next.

# 1.1. University classroom talk—a situationally diverse register

University classroom talk can be considered at the interface of an oral-literate continuum where ‘oral’ refers to prototypical speaking such as conversation, and ‘literate’ refers to stereotypical writing as in academic prose (Biber, 1988, 1995). University classroom talk seems to be a mixed register both in terms of its situational and linguistic characteristics. As for situational characteristics, class sessions seem to share features of both academic prose and faceto-face conversations (Biber, 1995). For example, like academic prose, class sessions have an informational (ideational) communicative purpose, and reflect a situation where pre-planned information is conveyed in an explicit manner as the result of planned discourse. At the same time, class sessions also resemble face-to-face conversations in terms of how the actual discourse is realized. That is, class sessions are produced through spoken channels, and are delivered on-line where the addresser shares the time and space relations with the addressee. Based on these situational characteristics in this brief analysis, it is predicted that the linguistic characteristics of classes will reflect the same mixture. However, in which dimensions of variation classes resemble academic prose over face-to-face conversation is to be explored further.

# 1.2. Goal of the study

The aim of the present study is to investigate the linguistic characteristics of class sessions and to describe the extent to which this register shares linguistic features of conversation and academic prose. One hundred and ninety-six university class sessions from six universities across the United States are analyzed using a corpus-based approach. First, I describe the corpus and the methods used for the analysis in Section 2. In brief, the framework for the analysis is based on Biber’s (1988) multidimensional study of variation across speech and writing. Several linguistic features are grouped into five parameters (see explanation of these terms and related linguistic features in Table 1):

(1) informational focus   
(2) involved production   
(3) explicit reference   
(4) abstract style   
(5) on-line informational elaboration.

These categories serve as the basis for comparing university class sessions to academic prose and face-to-face conversation. Second, I report on the findings, and third, I discuss the pedagogical implications in Section 4.

# 2. Research methodology

# 2.1. Design of the study

# 2.1.1. Corpus

In the present study, the term ‘university class sessions’ refers to any classroom settings ranging from frontal, lecture-type classes with a large audience, to seminar-like sessions, where discussions are more in focus. At times, the term is used alternately with ‘lectures’ or ‘academic lectures’. A total of 196 class sessions (about 1.4 million words) were selected from two academic corpora: the T2K-SWAL Corpus (Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; Biber, Conrad, Reppen, et al., 2004; Biber et al., 2002) of 2.7 million words of academic discourse collected at six universities in the United States,1 and the MICASE Corpus (Simpson & Swales, 2001) of 1.8 million words of speech events collected in the academic life of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. All class sessions were audio-recorded with a tape-recorder placed at the front of the classroom near the lecturer. All recordings were transcribed based on pre-defined transcribing conventions. Following the transcription, all texts were tagged automatically for grammatical features (see example in Appendix A), and fixtagged for particular features (cf. details are provided in Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; Biber, Conrad, Reppen, et al., 2004) by the graduate assistants of the Corpus Linguistics Research Program at Northern Arizona University.

# 2.2. Linguistic features selected for analysis

# 2.2.1. Grammatical categories

Biber’s (1988, 1995) analysis of variation across speech and writing served as the basis for the linguistic investigations. According to Biber, in determining the continuum in the variation across speech and writing, particular co-occurring grammatical forms can be associated with a variety of language functions. He calls the broadest functions identified for a set of features ‘dimensions’. He names six dimensions of linguistic variation through which a variety of registers are characterized (Biber, 1988). Given the situational analysis described in Section 1, the most appropriate dimensions for academic lectures are those containing linguistic features that relate to the informational load apparent in the academic context, and those that reflect the on-line, planned nature of university class sessions. For the purposes of the present study, selected features of the following five dimensions, especially relevant to academic lectures, will be discussed in detail: (1) informational focus, (2) involved production, (3) situation-dependent versus elaborated reference (explicit discourse), (4) abstract versus non-abstract information (abstract style), and (5) on-line informational elaboration. Instead of the term ‘dimensions’, however, I will call the different linguistic groups ‘feature groups’ because they are not a complete set of linguistic features as presented in Biber’s (1988, 1995) work. The most important linguistic features selected for analysis are summarized in Table 1.

# 2.3. Analysis

# 2.3.1. Computer programs

After the texts were run through a grammatical tagger (see above), I developed Delphi Pascal computer programs to count and display the characteristic linguistic features in the present study. The first program was developed to do the counts of the grammatical features specified in Section 1 and listed in Table 1. Two kinds of counts are reported in this study: (1) total counts for individual linguistic features within each feature group, and (2) total counts for each feature group. As an additional step, every lecture in the corpus gained five mean scores: one for each of the five feature groups (determined by the total counts of individual features in each group), and a list was generated containing the filenames and these scores. Then, the researcher determined a threshold for each feature group. The second program was developed to automatically select lectures exhibiting scores above the pre-determined threshold and to ‘write out’ a window of text (excerpts) from those lectures. Then, the researcher made the final decision on which extract would serve as best examples of the given feature group. Finally, the third program displays frequency counts for each word occurring in the corpus.

# 2.3.2. Counts and statistical analysis

Class sessions ranged from an average of 5 to 10,000 words. All feature counts were normed to 1000 words (total count of each feature divided by number of words, multiplied by 1000). This procedure compensates for differences in the length of lectures and provides equal opportunity for the linguistic features to occur.

For the statistical analyses, the computer program SAS-V8 was used. Descriptive statistics showed the means and standard deviation measures for each class session and for all sessions overall. Since Biber (1988) does not report the scores for each grammatical feature for the individual texts in the two registers (academic prose and face-to-face conversation), the comparison of the three registers in this study was done using methods of descriptive statistics that rely on overall mean scores and standard deviation measures.

# 3. Findings

As outlined earlier, the aim of the present study is to investigate the extent to which university class sessions share linguistic features of both conversation and academic prose. In this section first, I will report on the findings, focusing on the overall characteristics of the five dimensions compared through each feature group. Second, each feature group will be detailed and examined for how particular linguistic features distribute across the three registers.

# 3.1. Linguistic features in class sessions compared to academic prose and face-to-face conversation

Based on the situational characteristics that university class sessions share with academic prose and face-to-face conversation, it is reasonable to predict that class sessions exhibit linguistic features of both of these registers. First, an overview is given of the five feature groups in the five dimensions described in Table 1, followed by a detailed discussion of each feature group in the following order: informational focus, involved production, explicit discourse, abstract style, and on-line informational elaboration.

The results show that class sessions are distinctive in the extent to which they exhibit the five feature groups investigated. In one dimension class sessions are very similar to conversations (involved production, lack of abstract style), in two dimensions (informational focus and explicit discourse) they resemble academic prose, and in another dimension (on-line informational elaboration) class sessions are distinctive. Figs. 1 and 2 display the distribution of the total frequency counts for each feature group in the three registers.

As the figures display, university class sessions use a high number of linguistic features similar to academic prose, especially in terms of its informational focus (Fig. 1). The primary purpose of the academic setting is to work with notions, concepts in content areas relevant to a given discipline. These content areas or concepts are then processed in different ways, for example through a discussion, or through the participants’ introduction and exemplification of specific notions. This purpose is reinforced by the way explicit discourse manifests itself in classroom talk. Discourse in this setting is characterized by features of academic prose such as “context-independent reference” rather than by “situation-dependent reference” (Biber, 1995, p. 156), the latter being more common in conversations (Fig. 2).

As for involved production and abstract style, university classes seem to resemble face-toface conversations rather than academic prose (Figs. 1 and 2, respectively). Classes show slightly less involvement than face-to-face conversations, however, which might be due to the difference in the way interaction takes place in these two registers. In a face-to-face situation, the interlocutors have the chance to take the floor at any point in time of the conversation, while in a class situation, unless it is a free discussion, question-time may be allocated at certain intervals and specific times only. Given the topical focus and informational purpose of the academic context, it is not surprising that the mean scores for abstract style in lectures are slightly higher than for actual conversations. However, due to the lack of planning perhaps, they are much fewer than in academic prose.

Finally, on-line elaboration (Fig. 2) denotes a special, on-line situation (where both the speaker and listener share time and space relations) with an informational focus. As Biber (1995) indicates, on-line elaboration is typical of spoken registers that have “a primary informational, rather than interpersonal focus” and of spoken registers that are “produced under real-time constraints” often “overtly marking the speaker’s stance in combination with the informational focus” (p. 168). Class sessions seem to be distinctively marked for these features in comparison to the other two registers under discussion. In the following sections, I will discuss these similarities and differences more in detail and relate them to the individual linguistic features in each group.

# 3.1.1. Informational focus

As found in academic prose, information packaging is manifested through the frequent use of nouns, prepositions and attributive adjectives working together often in phrasal units. Extract 1 (below), taken from a transcribed segment of classroom talk, illustrates the accumulation of such a constellation (features underlined).

Extract 1

Teacher: .it would be very confusing to young children if there’s a mismatch between the personal and cultural knowledge perhaps of the teacher or the whole institution of the school and the children. Um, any more examples?

Student: um, I guess if they were raised with the, a strict Dine philosophy of life and then comparing that to um the you know the regular, with the Anglo society and how their philosophy   
Teacher: Ok so, so to look at   
Student: like the four sacred colors and four sacred mountains   
Teacher: Ok, traditional   
Student: yeah.   
Teacher: traditional people. Ok the next type of knowledge that B. looks at, and all of these types of knowledge are going to combine into the kind of knowledge that we have in schools, is um popular knowledge. And he defines that as the facts, concepts, explanations, and interpretations that are institutionalized within the mass media and other institutions that are part of popular culture. Those of you, especially who teach young children are very aware of, of trends in popular culture. Um my my kids are in college now and so I can’t, I, I, I don’t have such, so much contact with, with those trends and fads Um what movies are kids talking about right now?

A closer look at the text surrounding this extract reveals further micro-contextual information about the situation in which these utterances are made: the teacher makes multiple references to the assigned reading of the day. Taking the concepts in the textbook, he elicits further elaboration through examples from the students’ real life experiences in class. The frequent use of nouns and prepositions with dense, phrasal informational packaging is characteristic of carefully planned discourse, as it also appears in academic lectures. Although this may be true for this particular segment in the class session, it may not be true for the entire session, or for all sessions in the corpus. If this is the case, there must be some variation in the way the individual features contribute to the feature group. Looking at the mean frequency counts for the particular linguistic features working together in the dimension of informational focus, we do notice that they vary in classroom talk (see Table 2). This variation triggers further questions about how the information is packaged in these classes.

The mean noun count is nearly as high as it is in academic prose. At the same time, the use of prepositions does not resemble academic prose as closely; rather, they appear fewer times, while a little more often than in face-to-face conversation. As for attributive adjectives and word length, on average, they are present less often in class sessions than in either one of the genres under comparison. This finding juxtaposed with the high noun count suggests that nouns are used in the classroom context differently. On one hand, as exemplified in Extract 1, nouns are embedded in prepositional phrase structures that may include attributive adjectives. On the other hand, as exemplified in Extract 2 below, single nouns might be repeated multiple times (repeated nouns underlined). In these cases, they might or might not co-occur with prepositions and attributive adjectives (‘part of popular culture’ or ‘Hollywood’, respectively).

Student: friends are really important to them.

Without tracing each noun’s syntactic position, preliminary results of a pilot study I carried out on the frequency of each word in the corpus indicate that context-specific (i.e. classroomrelated) nouns such as point, question, class, part, problem, example, book, case, idea seem to occur most frequently in classroom talk (see details on the functions of ‘point’ and ‘thing’ in lectures in Swales, 2001) while other nouns such as, for example, abbreviations, absorptions, carcinogens, disproportionality, entablature occur only once in over a million words of classroom text. This suggests further that the overall frequency of nouns could potentially be composed of a variety of different nouns, on one hand, or through the repetition of a few nouns, on the other. In either scenario, a large number of nouns together with other grammatical and lexical features (e.g. word length; notice the words used only once having more characters, i.e. they are ‘longer’) are associated with a high informational load (Biber, 1988). Further research could bring out more, subtle descriptions of the nature of frequent and rare nouns in the corpus of university classrooms.

As discussed above, prepositional phrase constructions together with high noun and attributive adjective counts are primarily present in written texts such as academic prose. In these registers, sufficient time is available to plan the discourse with plenty of opportunities for condensing information and for reformulating language into linguistically compact phrasal units. The content of a class session (in most cases) is also planned ahead of time; however, the actual ‘text’ of the lecture is not necessarily written down word for word (unless it is a monologic lecture where the lecturer reads out the preplanned lecture text). Hence, the actual wording could vary, and this variation could easily depend on immediate contextual factors. One of these situational factors relates to the fact that participants share time and space relations, which is also characteristic of face-to-face conversation. In this shared space, the information is delivered on line. Although opportunities for reformulations exist in these situations, they are evidenced by repetitions rather than by the existence of carefully planned phrasal level information packaging (Biber, 1988) as in academic prose. More research is needed to describe the nature of information density, and its relationship to (a) discourse structure, and (b) instructional purposes in university class sessions.

# 3.1.2. Involved production

According to Biber (1988, 1995), involved production is characterized by the use of present tense, private verbs (e.g. think, feel), ‘THAT’ deletion, first and second person pronouns, contractions, ‘BE’ used as copula, ‘DO’ used as pro-verb, WH-questions, and demonstrative pronouns. These features are especially characteristic of conversations that focus on the “immediate circumstance and personal attitudes or feelings,” and reflect direct interaction and high personal involvement. In conversation, present tense, private verbs, ‘DO’ as pro-verb, and ‘BE’ as copula together reflect “an active, verbal style” (Biber, 1995, p. 143). Table 3 provides the mean scores for each grammatical feature in involved production.

The frequency of private verbs in classroom talk places class sessions between academic prose and face-to-face conversations. The use of ‘DO’ as pro-verb (i.e. replacing a verb to provide a more general reference, e.g. ‘He can do it.’) and the pronoun ‘IT’ reflect an economical way of expressing information—again, a characteristic of face-to-face conversations. Hence, these two features are very close to the frequencies found in conversation. In class sessions, fewer first person pronouns are used than in face-to-face conversations, but almost as many second person pronouns2 are used in lectures as in conversation (see Fortanet, 2004 for further discussion on ‘we’). Nonetheless, these features tend to be more characteristic of lectures than of academic prose. My results also show that a similar number of contractions can be found in class sessions as in face-to-face conversations. At the same time, ‘THAT’ deletion in class sessions appears nearly as frequently as in conversations. The following text sample (Extract 3) illustrates the grammatical features associated with the dimension of involved production.

What is distinctive to class sessions in this feature group is the number of demonstrative pronouns, the copula, and Wh-questions, all of which are even in a higher number than in conversations. Perhaps it is not surprising that we find more questions in classroom settings. More details on possible disciplinary differences concerning the types (e.g. Simpson, 2003) and location of questions could be explored further. As for demonstrative pronouns, a possible explanation for the high frequency could relate to how the link between concept and context interacts in class settings. While demonstrative pronouns usually refer to a clause or notion immediately preceding the pronoun in academic prose, they are often used to mark contextual reference in the classroom. As shown by earlier research on classroom discourse (e.g. Csomay, 2005a), this might be due to the speaker often explaining a figure or a text extract by frequently pointing to the actual object displayed either on the blackboard or on a picture. Through referencing parts of that object using demonstrative pronouns (e.g. ‘If you look at this, for example.’), links are made between concept and context.

# 3.1.3. Explicit discourse

Both wh-relative constructions and phrasal co-ordination are characteristic features of preplanned, highly informational registers such as academic prose. More specifically, wh-relative clauses expand on the information provided in a more explicit and elaborate way. Phrasal coordination also indicates tight information packaging, typically not found in a more structurally and topically loose, conversational style. Not surprisingly, class sessions exhibit similar patterns to conversational style. Table 4 below shows the distribution (mean scores and standard deviations) of the types of relativization and nominalization patterns and the frequency of phrasal co-ordination in the three registers.

The number of wh-relatives in subject position3 places lectures between academic prose and face-to-face conversations. Further research might shed light on how the types and uses of wh-relatives relate to on-line production circumstances and whether relativization patterns with ‘THAT’ as relative pronoun versus wh-relative clauses are preferred in class sessions. The example below (Extract 4) illustrates the way the features in this group are used in academic lectures.

Extract 4

Teacher: Uh but most of the elements we’re using were they’re in the older uh versions of Java and it’s a little more universal in terms of putting it on the web and so forth uh to use these older uh more standard components. And so I sort of switched to that. Uh. we start by creating a (scores) output class which extends output and then it’s going to do what? OK. So that’s.. it’s extending output as a subclass of output which we’ve seen before. It’s going to implement two different interfaces because all the items that I choose from, that would include the choice element up there, of choosing the speed uh the check box group where I picked the suit color and the check box to either sleep uh sleep the yo-yo or not sleep the yo-yo. Those all uh. need the item listener uh interface, you know they are all in essence listening for the choice of an item of some kind. OK?

# 3.1.4. Abstract style

Abstract style is associated with the use of passive constructions (by- and agentless passive, and post-nominal past participial constructions), and academic prose is the most marked for these. Overall, language associated with this feature group is more than $50 \%$ less in class sessions than in academic prose. The results also show that in class sessions both types of passive constructions are slightly (not reaching $50 \%$ ) more frequent than in conversations (Table 5). At the same time, post-nominal passive constructions are a little over 10 times more frequent in classes than in face-to-face conversations. Hence, post-nominal passive constructions have further interesting characteristics for this study. Besides being passives, they are reduced relatives (e.g. ‘The results [that were] reported by the committee were positive’). On the one hand, relatives, which can be found in registers such as academic prose, mark an explicit style with informational elaboration. On the other hand, reduced forms are often used in registers that are delivered under duress. Janda (1985) signals that reduced relatives are favored in notetaking, for example, a register that requires “the production of highly informational discourse under severe time-constraints” (Biber, 1988, p. 233). Additionally, as passives, post-nominals often appear together with other passive constructions marking an abstract, impersonal style. Given these characteristics, the frequent use of post-nominal constructions in class sessions supports the idea of classes exhibiting features of a highly informational register with abstract style happening under real time conditions.

All right secondly, the groups, supposedly mistreated or oppressed are uh, supposedly oppressed by some dominant group. may be different means. it may be institutional, legal, intellectual, even linguistic, in terms of how, one feels, uh conveys.

# 3.1.5. Online elaboration

The fifth feature group, online elaboration, characterizes situations where both the speaker and the listener share real time and immediate physical or mental space relations (Fortanet, 2004). The analysis has shown that regarding the use of adjective complements, lectures tend to be between academic prose and face-to-face conversations, while other features are represented in a special way in lectures (Table 6).

The extremely high number of verb complements and existential ‘THERE’ suggests that these grammatical features are distinctive in academic lectures. Considering this finding in tandem with the high number of demonstrative pronouns in the second feature group discussed above indicates that class sessions are, indeed, a special register in which the speakers often refer to the ‘here and now’ while engaging in a dialogue and while verbalizing their thoughts and opinions on a given topic, all delivered on-line. The following text extract (Extract 6) is taken from the corpus and illustrates the grammatical features listed in this feature group (underlined).

Extract 6

Teacher: OK two [1 syll] one, I thought [that0]4 you were going in a different [unclear word] with the question, if dividends are irrelevant, then why do we say that the value of the firm why (would) we say that $\mathrm { \bf P }$ zero is D one over K 5 minus G? Good question, right? That’s your question. Here’s why we say that. When we’re doing this analysis, what is it that’s going to drive dividends

Whole class: earnings

Teacher: OK that’s [1 syll] OK I’m sorry, other way. [writing on the board] earnings are going to drive dividends, what is it that’s going to drive earnings?

Student: growth

Teacher: well growth ultimately what’s going to generate those earnings? I think [that0] it’s going to be the assets. And what is it that’s going to generate the choice of assets?

Teacher: OK. Then we have something called direct examination, now, you’ll directcross, re-direct, and re-cross, [3 sylls] on every witness. When the plaintiff is presenting. they conduct the direct examination. When defense presents their, their witnesses, they will conduct the direct examination, the other one will cross. Direct examination, there are a couple of rules, they’re very important for you to know. On direct examination, there are two kinds of question you cannot ask, and this’ll be on the test. There are two kinds of questions you cannot ask. One, you cannot ask a leading question. You cannot ask a leading question on direct examination. The other is you cannot ask a open-ended question, and I will talk about what I mean by open-ended in just a second. .

As discussed earlier, in the first feature group nouns seem to dominate and carry the information in class sessions. Another study might be able to show in detail the kinds of lexical items that are in service to weave the high informational focus (i.e. the content) together in these situations. Verbs, for example, are good candidates to help connect nouns and noun phrases in the web of discourse. Here, I mention only a few verbs that are frequently used in these class sessions, and some of which take ‘THAT’ complement clauses: think, see, mean, get, make, look, talk, take, give, try, call.

# 4. Summary and further research

The present study aimed at investigating the linguistic characteristics of 196 university class sessions recorded at six universities across the United States, and compared them to those of academic prose and face-to-face conversation. The findings showed that the class sessions investigated exhibit features of both registers. While closer to academic prose in informational focus and abstract style, class sessions were closer to face-to-face conversation in features associated with involved production circumstances and situationdependent, (non-)explicit discourse. Finally, in the fifth feature group, class sessions exceeded frequencies in both registers in language features associated with on-line elaboration.

In looking at the individual features in each group mentioned above, the results showed very frequent use of four items distinctive to class sessions: ‘THAT’ complement clauses, existential ‘THERE’, ‘BE’ as copula, and demonstrative pronouns. Besides often marking stance, most of these are characteristic of involved discourse, and on-line informational elaboration. Of this set, perhaps the most interesting is demonstrative pronouns. They could potentially serve as links between content and context, the details of which need further exploration.

Another distinctive feature of class sessions compared to the other two registers is the frequent noun use and limited preposition and attributive adjective use. This finding suggests that, although information is primary in classes, it is disseminated, and expressed in linguistically alternative ways from academic prose. Instead of a compact phrasal construction, it is more likely that individual nouns are repeated more often than they are embedded in phrases. In support of this claim, we also note the relatively low count for phrasal coordination in the third feature group (Table 4) and the low attributive adjective count. Alternatively, instead of repetition, the intensive presence of nouns in classes could originate from a variety of different nouns to express the information under discussion. Whether the former or the latter is the case needs empirical investigation.

The results reported here might not be surprising. It supports earlier assertions that “academic speech is much more variable in structure, function, and style than academic writing” (Swales, 2001, p. 35). Based on quantitative measures, this study provides a comprehensive linguistic characterization of a single academic register (classroom talk) in one context (American universities), and as such, adds to the body of corpus-based classroom research on academic spoken discourse. However, the results point to further research potentially attempting to answer some of the following questions:

(1) When the most frequent features occur (e.g. nouns), do they appear in particular clusters or do they appear scattered throughout a session?   
(2) What kinds of nouns are repeated most in class sessions? Which nouns occur only once in the entire corpus?   
(3) How do the most frequently co-occurring features relate to particular phases in a class session?   
(4) How does language variation relate to discourse structure, and to instructional purposes in class sessions?   
(5) How is university classroom talk similar or different in other native- and non-native English speaking settings compared to those in US contexts?

While more research describing language use particularly in areas of spoken academic discourse is timely, the results of this study raise awareness about the overall linguistic patterns apparent in university classroom talk as compared to the other two registers. By providing this profile, the study is informative for those actually teaching in these classes and for those teaching academic literacy to non-native English speaker students who struggle to gain control over academic discourse around the world. Descriptive studies of this kind could inform teachers in the former role to find out about the instructional effectiveness of forms of delivery. When triangulated with other methods of inquiry, we can explore what teaching techniques and what linguistic resources make the content more accessible to the students, hence, aid better comprehension of the instructional material. As for teachers in the latter role, by designing interactive instructional materials that reflect the complexity and the variation of linguistic features characterizing university classroom talk, we can enable our students in group work

sessions, study sessions and lecture sessions, to produce variations of oral–literate discourse.   
This, in turn, will enhance their learning and aid their acculturation to the academic context.

One of the limitations of this study relates to the inability to capture linguistic variation within class sessions. The feature frequencies were counted in full class sessions and scaled to a thousand words. However, it is quite unlikely that an entire lecture period is spent on reading aloud from a written paper (reflecting highly informational focus), or that the whole period would center around discussions (reflecting involved discourse). Instead, these two extremes could alternate, depending on the instructional purposes of the particular phases in the session. For example, a piece of written text could be read out for a few minutes followed by an interpretative discussion phase. These two phases have different instructional purposes and exhibit varying language, as described in earlier studies (e.g. Dudley-Evans, 1994; Hansen, 1994; Strodt-Lopez, 1993; Young, 1994) providing in-depth analyses of a few lectures on these relationships. To be able to provide generalizable findings in this respect, we need to find ways to successfully describe both linguistic and interactional variation within class sessions (Csomay, 2005b). Therefore, I call for additional micro-analyses on the relationship between discourse structure and language variation in university classrooms through the use of both quantitative and computational methods.
