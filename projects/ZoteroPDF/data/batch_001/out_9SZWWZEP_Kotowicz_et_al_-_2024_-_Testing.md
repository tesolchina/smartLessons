# ABSTRACT

Bimodal bilingualism involves the use of a sign language and a spoken language, and offers a unique opportunity to explore the cognitive effects of growing up bilingual. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between bimodal bilingualism and executive function (EF) in hearing children who are native users of a sign language. We studied three groups of children: bimodal bilinguals (users of a sign language and a spoken language), unimodal bilinguals (users of two spoken languages), and monolinguals, performing three cognitive tasks to measure different components of EF: visuospatial working memory (Odd One Out task), cognitive flexibility (Children’s Colored Trails Test) and conflict resolution (Simon task). All groups of children obtained similar scores on the Odd One Out task and the Children’s Colored Trails Test. Bimodal bilinguals displayed distinct patterns of conflict resolution in comparison to monolingual children: bimodal bilinguals had better overall accuracy and slower overall reaction time in the Simon task. The subsequent analysis did not find a straightforward trade-off between speed and accuracy. These results suggest that bimodal language experience and/or visual-spatial language usage may explain the small bimodal bilingual advantage in the Simon task that we observed in hearing children who are native signers.

Executive function (EF) is a set of high-level cognitive processes required to obtain a desired goal, to solve a new problem or to react appropriately in a complex or ambiguous situation (Hughes and Devine 2019; Hughes, Graham, and Grayson 2004). Some examples of EF skills are mental flexibility, fast adaptation to a changing environment, managing conflicting ideas, ignoring non-target data in information overload, and being able to self-control. EF skills may help individuals to become successful in different areas of life (Diamond 2013), constituting an important factor not just in academic success (Best, Miller, and Naglieri 2011), e.g. EF skills predict mathematical achievement (Bull, Espy, and Wiebe 2008), but also in social life (Hughes, Dunn, and White 1998), and in physical and mental health (Moffitt et al. 2011). For this reason, research has addressed factors that may have a positive effect on the development of EF in children; one potential EF accelerator is bilingualism (Bialystok 2015). Although the mechanisms by which bilingual language experience might enhance EF have not been fully explained, the processing of two languages has been argued to train the general EF system. When the bilingual mind processes language, the two languages are coactivated to some extent (Kroll, Bobb, and Wodniecka 2006); at the point of external communication, the bilingual has to select the correct target language, inhibiting the other language. As bilingual language processing therefore requires monitoring to ensure that only the correct language is being used, bilinguals need to control language processing to a greater extent than monolinguals, and this is thought to provide greater experience in managing high-level demands, resulting in general EF benefits in non-linguistic tasks (Bialystok 2017).

The hypothesis of an EF bilingual advantage was initially strongly supported by a substantial number of studies: showing that unimodal bilingual children, using two spoken languages, outperform monolingual peers on tasks demanding working memory (WM) (e.g. Morales, Calvo, and Bialystok 2013), cognitive flexibility (Barac and Bialystok 2012) and conflict resolution (e.g. Poarch and van Hell 2012; for review: Bialystok 2015).

However, the cognitive effect of bilingualism has become a topic of intense debate more recently because studies of the bilingual cognitive advantage have proved to be less consistent than previously claimed (e.g. Paap, Johnson, and Sawi 2015). In the past few years, researchers have published results incompatible with the bilingual advantage hypothesis. Several studies have shown that bilinguals do not outperform monolinguals in EF nonverbal tasks, indicating that bilingualism does not influence the general EF system (Duñabeitia et al. 2014; Paap and Greenberg 2013; Paap, Johnson, and Sawi 2015). Also, strong doubts have been cast on the evidence for a cognitive advantage in bilinguals more generally (Paap and Greenberg 2013). Whether bilingualism enhances EF is therefore still a subject of heated debate. It has been suggested that being bilingual in itself might not necessarily support EF (Clayden et al. 2023) and that the reported bilingual cognitive advantage is linked to specific bilingual language experiences that include inter alia language use in the context of language switching based on external factors (Blanco-Elorrieta and Pylkkänen 2018; de Bruin, Dick, and Carreiras 2021).

To date the majority of the studies on bilingual advantage have been concerned with unimodal bilingualism in two spoken languages. However, researchers have recently begun to investigate the relationship between high-level cognitive functioning and bimodal bilingualism: bilingualism involving a sign language and a spoken language (Emmorey, Giezen, and Gollan 2016). In the earliest studies, the possible advantages of bilingualism were claimed to be limited to unimodal bilingualism because bimodal bilingualism requires less language control (Emmorey, Luk, et al. 2008). In accordance with research on unimodal bilingualism (Marian and Spivey 2003), bimodal bilinguals appear to co-activate both their languages during language comprehension even in monolingual contexts (Shook and Marian 2012); however, the nature of the competition and its resolution differ for bimodal and unimodal bilinguals. Unlike unimodal bilinguals, bimodal bilinguals can resolve language competition by producing or perceiving elements from two languages simultaneously: i.e. they can produce signs and words at the same time (Emmorey, Borinstein, and Thompson 2005), while unimodal bilinguals cannot articulate two different words at the same time. Simultaneous production of two languages at the same time is called code-blending (Emmorey, Borinstein, et al. 2008; Kotowicz, Wodniecka, and Tondos 2022). According to Emmorey, Luk, et al. (2008), hearing bimodal bilinguals appear to be less obliged to monitor activation of the non-target language as they can produce signs and spoken words at the same time, whereas unimodal bilinguals have to control separate language production more actively.

Not consistent with the hypothesis that only unimodal bilingualism may shape cognitive control, was research by Macnamara and Conway (2014), who found that extensive bimodal bilingual experience with American Sign Language (ASL) and English enhanced EF skills. After 2 years of training, ASL-English students of simultaneous interpreting improved their performance on switching, mental flexibility and WM. In line with that study, it has been shown that bimodal bilingual adults outperformed monolinguals in the flanker task, indicating enhanced conflict resolution skills (Kotowicz et al. 2016). Moreover, Giezen et al. (2015) showed a relationship between bimodal bilingual language functioning and EF abilities. Better ASL sign inhibition (using a visual world paradigm in English) was correlated with enhanced nonverbal inhibition in a Stroop task. These studies suggest that bimodal bilinguals’ experience is associated with enhanced cognitive control. The ways in which EF is associated with bimodal bilingualism still need to be investigated, especially in the context of the intense debate about a bilingual EF advantage.

# Present study

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the EF level of bimodal bilingual children compared to unimodal bilinguals and monolinguals (Kotowicz, Woll, and Morgan 2020). Children’s EF skills were assessed on a variety of EF tasks to measure different components of EF that might be sensitive to bilingual experience: visuospatial working memory (Odd One Out task), cognitive flexibility (Children’s Colored Trails Test) and conflict resolution (Simon task). English language abilities (British Picture Vocabulary Scale) and nonverbal intelligence (Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices) were also measured to control for possible differences in three groups: bimodal bilinguals, unimodal bilinguals and monolinguals. The two bilingual groups of children shared some features of language experience (school and outside-home activities in English; and minority language at home) and differed in relation to other features (using languages in one versus two modalities).

1. We expected that if bimodal bilingual children experience beneficial effects on EF such as those found for unimodal bilinguals, this would be reflected in better scores of both bimodal bilinguals and unimodal bilinguals compared to monolingual children, on tasks designed to measure WM, cognitive flexibility and conflict resolution.   
2. If bimodal bilingualism does not modify EF and unimodal bilingualism positively affects cognitive control, there would be no differences between bimodal bilingual children and monolingual children when performing the EF tasks, and both groups would have lower EF scores than unimodal children.   
3. If only bimodal bilingual children benefit in EF, then they would outperform both unimodal bilinguals and monolinguals in EF tasks designed to measure WM, cognitive flexibility and conflict resolution.   
4. If the two types of bilingualism: unimodal and bimodal, are not associated with EF benefits, then all three groups of children would score similarly on EF tasks.

# Participants

Ethical approval was obtained from the UCL Research Ethics Committee. 102 children (3 were subsequently excluded – see below) took part in the study (male $= 4 7$ , female $= 5 5$ ) aged between 5;0 and 11;10 (years; months) $( M = 8 ; 5$ , $S D = 1 ; 8 )$ . Children were recruited mainly via social media and minority cultural centers and associations (e.g. Polish cultural center/deaf parents’ organization). Two monolingual children who did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the study (one monolingual child used his heritage language at home to some extent, and one was undergoing processes directed at diagnosis of additional disability). All children lived in England and were in educational settings providing instruction in English. All children had normal or above normal nonverbal intelligence measured by Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices and normal or above normal English skills measured by the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS), except for one bimodal bilingual child who refused to finish the BPVS and was excluded from the study. All the others had scores greater than 2 SD below the mean. British Sign Language (BSL) and Polish skills were evaluated by parental report in the Language Questionnaire (see below).

Children with additional disabilities, learning difficulties, language delay or language impairments reported by parents were not recruited to the study. Demographic details of the participants are presented in Table 1.

Bimodal bilingual children. Thirty-two hearing bimodal bilinguals took part in the study (male $= 1 4$ , female $= 1 8 1$ ). They ranged in age from $^ { 5 ; 4 }$ to 11;3 (years; months) $( M = 8 ; 8$ , $S D = 1 ; 9$ ). All of the bimodal bilingual children had at least one deaf parent who was a BSL user. 23/32 had two deaf parents. Nine bimodal bilingual children were reported to have one hearing parent who used BSL; seven of them had additional deaf family members (e.g. cousin, great-grandmother). Twenty five of the children used BSL with both parents on a daily basis and all 32 children used BSL daily with at least one parent. All had been exposed to BSL from birth. All attended schools where instruction was in English. None of the children had a hearing impairment.

Unimodal bilingual children. Thirty-five unimodal bilingual children were included in the study (male $= 1 5 ,$ female $= 2 0 \mathrm { \cdot }$ ). They ranged in age from 5;0 to 11;10 (years; months) $( M = 8 ; 7$ , $S D =$ 1;10). All used both English and Polish on a daily basis. 25/35 had two parents who spoke Polish; the remainder had at least one Polish-speaking parent. The unimodal bilinguals were exposed to Polish from birth. English was the language of instruction at school for all the unimodal bilingual children.

Monolingual children. Thirty-two monolingual children were included in the study (male $= 1 5$ , female $= 1 7$ ). They ranged in age from $^ { 5 ; 8 }$ to 11;4 (years; months) $( M = 8 ; 1$ , $S D = 1 ; 7$ ). All monolingual children used only English on a daily basis: both at school and at home.

The two bilingual groups were matched on a variety of characteristics: both groups were living in England and English was the language of instruction at school. All the bilingual children used a language other than English (BSL/Polish) for communication with at least one parent. The groups were selected to ensure homogeneity of cultures: both bimodal groups are immersed in mainstream British culture and experience the minority culture at home. In the bimodal bilingual group, all children’s parental culture was Deaf culture and in the unimodal bilinguals – Polish culture.

The bilingual groups did not differ significantly on two measures of bilingualism scored by their parents using a 7 point scale of proficiency of home language (bimodal bilingual: $M = 5 . 7 2$ , $S D =$ 1.276; unimodal bilingual: $M = 5 . 7 4$ , $S D = 1 . 0 6 7$ ; $U = 5 4 7 . 5 0 0$ , $p = . 8 7 0 )$ ; and percentage of time when the home language was used at home (bimodal bilingual $M = 6 9$ , $S D = 2 2$ ; unimodal bilingual $M = 7 6$ ; $S D = 2 1$ ; $U = 4 2 5 . 5 0 0$ , $p = . 0 8 9 )$ . However, there was a trend $( p < . 1 )$ suggesting that the unimodal bilinguals used slightly more Polish at home than bimodal bilinguals used BSL. Moreover, in the unimodal bilingual group, there were more families with both parents using only the home language $( \chi 2 ( 1 ) = 7 . 0 3 3 ; p = . 0 1 0 )$ .

The three groups did not differ significantly on age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (parent’s educational level was used as a proxy of socio-economic status), language skills in English (measured by the British Picture Vocabulary Scales) and nonverbal intelligence (measured by Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices) (see Table 1).

# Procedure

Before conducting the study, the research project was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (Project ID Number 0772/006).

Parents/guardians were informed about the study by means of a parental information sheet. They were encouraged to consider the information, ask any questions and discuss the study. They were then required to sign the parental consent form and to complete the parent questionnaire (the majority of the questions concerned the children’s communication preferences). Deaf parents were also offered the opportunity to view a BSL video translation of the information sheet and consent form. Polish translations of all documents were available for Polish parents. All children were given an information sheet for participants. The researchers also ensured that the children had the time and opportunity to discuss whether they were willing to take part in the study. Immediately before the session, the researcher explained the study again at a level appropriate to the child’s age. Children then were asked to sign a child consent form.

All participants were tested individually in a quiet setting at their home. EF and language tasks were administered in a single session lasting approximately 1 h including breaks, which were allowed between tasks. All tasks were administrated by a hearing signer (psychologist and special educator).

Children received a small gift (pencils/rubbers/pens and a colorful certificate) at the end of the session to thank them for taking part. Even in cases where the parent decided to withdraw their child from participation, or where the child decided to stop a session, the child still received the gift. Children were only informed about the small gift after testing in order not to influence their decision about participation in the study.

# Materials

# $E F$ measures

A computer-based Odd One Out Task (Henry 2001) measures visuo-spatial WM skills. In the first part, three items are presented in a row and child is asked to point to the item that is different from the other two. The child is also required to remember the location of the different items. In the second part, the child is asked to recall and point to the location of the ‘odd one out’ item in the blank row. The number of rows (each with one item different from the others) increases by one row at a time up to 6 rows, and the child is asked to recall all the ‘odd ones out’ in the correct sequence order. WM skills are calculated by adding the number of correct trials.

Children’s Colour Trails Test is a paper and pencil test assessing cognitive flexibility. The Children’s Colours Trails Test contains two parts: Test 1 and Test 2. In Test 1, the task is to sequence numbers from 1 to 25. The participant is asked to work correctly and quickly. Numbers are embedded in colored circles: pink circles contain odd numbers (1,3,5 etc.) and yellow circles contain even numbers (2,4,6 etc.). In Test 2, all numbers are double: there is a version of each number in both the pink and yellow circles. The child is required to connect the circles in ascending number order, changing colors each time she/he draws a link: pink 1 should be connected with yellow 2 and then with pink 3. Tests 1 and 2 are each preceded by training. Time on task in Test 1 and Test 2 was measured. A measure of cognitive flexibility was calculated as the difference between Time 2 and Time 1.

Simon task (Botting et al. 2017) measures conflict resolution skills. A computer-based version with child-friendly software was administered. Children are presented with an image of an apple or a sun on the screen. The child is asked to press the key with the apple sticker (left shift key on the keyboard) when an apple is presented and to press the key with the sun sticker when a sun appears (right shift key on the keyboard). Thirty-two trials are split into two conditions: in the congruent condition, the target (sun or apple) appears on the side of the keyboard where the correct key is located (e.g. the apple appears on the left side of the screen and the key marked with the apple sticker is also on the left side). In the incongruent condition, the target is presented on the side opposite to where the key with the correct sticker is located (e.g. the apple appears on the right side of the screen and the key with the apple sticker is on the left side of the keyboard). Each trial starts with a fixation cross (500 msec) followed by a blank interval (500 msec). Then the sun/apple stimulus appears on the screen for 250 msec. Each trial ends with a 500 msec blank screen. Accuracy and reaction time for incongruent and congruent trials were measured.

# Analysis

All data were examined for normality of distribution. Non-normally distributed data were transformed before being entered into the models. If the assumption of a linear relation between covariate and dependent variable was met, then age and/or Raven’s scores were entered as a covariate in the models. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons.

# Results

Odd one out. All scores were $\pm 3 5 0$ from the mean for all participants (see Table 2, Figure 1). One-way ANCOVA was conducted with age (in months) as a continuous covariate. There were no significant differences between language groups $( F ( 2 , 9 5 ) = 0 . 9 5 1$ , $p = . 3 9 0$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 0 )$ . Age was a significant covariate in the model $( F ( 2 , 9 5 ) = 4 7 . 6 8 1$ 1 $p < . 0 0 1$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 3 3 4 )$ ). Effect of age did not differ between groups. Raven’s scores were not entered into the model as a covariate because there was no linear relation between Raven’s scores and Odd One Out scores in any of the groups.

because they scored 3 SD above the mean score in T1: two unimodal bilingual and one monolingual child. For Time 2 all scores were $\pm 3 5 \mathsf { D }$ . After removing outlier scores from the analysis, there were 30 children in the bimodal bilingual group, 33 in the unimodal bilingual group, and 31 in the monolingual group. The scores are shown in Table 2 and in Figure 2.

A mixed ANCOVA was conducted with test (Test 1 and Test 2) as the within-subject factor and with language group (bimodal bilingual, unimodal bilingual, and monolingual) as betweensubject factors, and with age (in months) as a continuous covariate. The main effect of test (condition) was significant $( F ( 1 , 9 0 ) = 1 7 , 3 4 4 , p < . 0 0 1$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 6 2 )$ but there was no effect of language group $( F ( 2 , 9 0 ) = 1 . 5 5 8$ $p = . 2 1 6$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ .033). There was no interaction between test and language group $F ( 2 , 9 0 ) = . 1 6 6$ , $p = . 8 4 8$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 4$ . Age was a significant covariate in the model $( F ( 1 , 9 0 ) = 9 6 , 8 5 4$ , $p < . O O 1$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 5 1 8 )$ . Effect of age did not differ between groups.

Raven’s scores were not entered into the model as a covariate because there was no linear relation between Raven’s scores and the Children’s Color Trails Test (with the exception of monolingual children at Time 2).

Interference control – Simon task. Missing data from one unimodal bilingual child was caused by technical problems. Trials with $\mathsf { R T s } < 2 0 0$ ms were excluded because they likely reflected anticipatory responses. In addition, all scores were $\pm 3$ SD (See Table 2 and Figure 3). There were some scores below $5 0 \%$ accuracy in the congruent condition (2 bimodal bilingual children, 2 unimodal bilingual children and 5 monolingual children). Those scores were removed. After removing outlier scores from the analysis, there were 30 in the bimodal bilingual group, 32 in the unimodal bilingual group, and 27 in the monolingual group.

For accuracy, repeated measure 2-way ANOVA was conducted on congruency (congruent/incongruent) and on language groups (bimodal bilingual, unimodal bilingual and monolingual). There was a main effect of congruency $( F ( 1 , 8 6 ) = 8 3 . 9 6 3$ , $p < . O O 1$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 4 9 4 )$ , and language group (F(2,86) $= 3 . 2 0 6 ~ p = . 0 4 5$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 6 8 )$ . A post hoc analysis with Bonferroni corrections showed that the mean score difference between bimodal bilingual and monolingual children was significant, with bimodal bilinguals having better scores than monolinguals $( p = . 0 4 0 )$ . Other differences between groups were not significant. When accuracy in the incongruent and congruent conditions was analysed, bimodal bilinguals had higher scores than monolinguals in the incongruent condition $( p$ $= . 0 3 8 )$ , with no difference in the congruent condition $( p = . 4 2 2 )$ . There was no interaction between congruency and language group $( F ( 2 , 8 6 ) = 1 . 3 0 1$ , $p = . 2 7 7$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 9 )$ ).

There was no linear relation between age and accuracy in either condition or language group, so age in months was not entered as a covariate. The same situation was found for Raven’s scores, so Raven’s scores were not entered as a covariate in the model.

For the RTs, the Simon effect was analysed using as a measure a 2-way ANCOVA, with congruency (congruent, incongruent) as a within-participant factor, language groups (bimodal bilingual, unimodal bilingual and monolingual) as between-participant factors and age as a covariate. Age was entered in the model because there was a linear relation between age and accuracy in both conditions in all three language groups. The main effect of congruency was significant $( F ( 1 , 8 5 ) =$ 4.841, $p = . 0 3 1$ , partial $\eta 2 = . 0 5 4 )$ , indicating that all children were faster in the congruent condition than in the incongruent condition. The overall main effect of language group was significant $( F$ $( 2 , 8 5 ) = 3 . 1 1 1$ , $p = . 0 5 0 ,$ , partial $\eta 2 = . 0 6 8 )$ . The post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment showed that monolinguals had overall faster RTs than the bimodal bilinguals $( p = . 0 5 0 )$ . However, when congruent and incongruent conditions were analysed separately, monolinguals had shorter RTs in congruent conditions than bimodal bilinguals $( p = . 0 0 9 )$ , while the difference was not significant in the incongruent condition $( p = . 3 3 1 )$ . Age was a significant covariate in the model $( F ( 1 , 8 5 ) = 8 4 . 3 2 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 4 9 8 )$ . There was no interaction between congruency and language group $( F ( 2 , 8 5 ) = . 8 7 0$ , $p = . 4 2 3$ partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 0 )$ ).

Taking into account that there was no linear relation between Raven’s scores and accuracy in either condition or language group, Raven’s scores were not entered into the model.

# Discussion

The aim of the present study was to investigate EF skills in bimodal bilingual children who are hearing native sign language users, compared to unimodal bilinguals and monolinguals. In the present study three groups of children (bimodal bilingual, unimodal bilingual and monolingual) did not differ significantly on measures of working memory skills (the Odd one out task) and cognitive flexibility (the Children’s Colour Trails Test). Compared to monolinguals, bimodal bilinguals had better overall accuracy and slower overall RT in the Simon task. However, the post-hoc analysis did not confirm a simple speed-accuracy trade-off: the accuracy difference between these groups was present only in the incongruent condition, whereas the RT difference was observed only in the congruent condition. Unimodal bilinguals showed no parallel differences in accuracy and RT scores in the Simon task and no relation between unimodal bilingualism and EF benefits was observed. The relationship between bimodal bilingualism and conflict resolution capacity remains unclear because on the one hand, the incongruent condition is more cognitively challenging and demands conflict resolution, but on the other hand the effect sizes of captured differences were small and there was a discrepancy between accuracy scores and RT’s.

In the present study, the absence of a unimodal bilingual advantage in all measured components of EF is likely to be linked to limited experience of switching between languages that has been proposed to play an important role in the bilingual advantage hypothesis (Blanco-Elorrieta and Pylkkä- nen 2018; Costa et al. 2009; Scaltritti, Peressotti, and Miozzo 2017). According to Blanco-Elorrieta and Pylkkänen (2018) the bilingual advantage may emerge from a specific language environment that reflects the ability to frequently switch between languages following external factors. In the present study, the unimodal bilinguals used mainly Polish within the family (a mean of $7 6 \%$ of the time) while English was spoken during activities outside the home. The two languages had different contexts of use, hence switching opportunities were limited and language processing did not demand EF skills. This is the likely reason for the unimodal bilinguals not showing a bilingual EF advantage.

On the surface, bimodal and unimodal bilingual language experiences appear similar: English as the dominant language in the wider community and the other language at home, as a heritage language. However, the bimodal bilingual environment is not clearly divided into two separate contexts. Code-blending (simultaneous use of signing and spoken language) is present both in the input bimodal bilingual children receive from their Deaf parents and in their own output (Lillo-Martin et al. 2014; Petitto et al. 2001; van den Bogaerde and Baker 2005). As switching from one language into code-blending is effortless (Emmorey, Giezen, and Gollan 2016) and code-blending facilitates language processing (Emmorey, Petrich, and Gollan 2012), bimodal bilingualism had been earlier thought not to provide the contexts of language use associated with enhanced EF skills (Emmorey, Luk, et al. 2008). However, the cognitive cost of going from code-blending to a single language mode may be high (Blanco-Elorrieta, Emmorey, and Pylkkänen 2018; Kaufmann and Philipp 2017), and therefore this mechanism may increase cognitive demand in bimodal language processing. Moreover, code-switching may impose complex language control: bilinguals not only have to select one of their two languages but also choose between use of a single code (using one language at a time) or code-blending (signing and speaking at the same time) (Ding 2016). Furthermore, in the present study, the majority of the parents $( N = 2 7 )$ used both languages (BSL and English) with their bimodal bilingual children, although we did not investigate the dominant type of switching between languages. Frederiksen and Kroll (2022) proposed that experience with language switching and mixing may vary in bimodal bilinguals. As language switching based on external constraints might be more challenging for executive function than free language mixing (de Bruin, Dick, and Carreiras 2021), it is possible that, in the current study, the bimodal bilinguals’ language environment included language switching determined by external demands. Consequently, bimodal language experience with code-blending and/or language environment may explain the subtle benefits we observed on conflict resolution.

Moreover, Emmorey, Giezen, and Gollan (2016) suggested that the bimodal bilingual advantage in the Simon task may not be a pure bilingual effect but may reflect the experience of visual-spatial language. Previous studies have shown that sign language experience has an impact on visuo-spatial cognitive abilities, with deaf and hearing signers outperforming non-signers in spatial memory, measured by the Corsi block task (deaf signers: Geraci et al. 2008; Wilson et al. 1997; hearing signers: Keehner and Gathercole 2007; Logan, Maybery, and Fletcher 1996); and in mental rotation abilities (deaf signers: Emmorey, Klima, and Hickok 1998; hearing signers: Karen Emmorey, Kosslyn, and Bellugi 1993). There is also some evidence that not only deafness but also sign language experience enhances peripheral processing: helping to localize targets in the periphery of the visual field (Dye, Seymour, and Hauser 2015). According to Emmorey, Giezen, and Gollan (2016), sign language experience and signers’ visual-spatial cognitive benefit could also influence Simon task scores, as in this task participants are required to resolve visual-spatial conflict: signers need to inhibit spatial information (stimulus location) and respond on the basis of stimulus shape only (sun versus apple). The task is therefore based on visual and spatial abilities that might be enhanced by experience of a visual spatial language.

The present study also supports deaf parents’ choice to use sign language on a daily basis with their hearing children, showing that bimodal bilingualism in hearing individuals does not hamper EF. On the contrary, using spoken and sign languages on a daily basis may have some beneficial effects for cognitive functioning of hearing children who are native signers.

# Limitation of the study

Limitations of this study include the large age range of participants which may introduce substantial variability in cognitive skills and limit types of measures suitable for children varying in age. The broad age range of children in the present research is explained by the limited numbers of hearing native signers in the population. As EF develops intensively during childhood (Hughes, Graham, and Grayson 2004), it would be highly recommended to explore in the future studies the connection between cognitive control and bimodal bilingualism in a cohort of children within a more specific age range.

In the present study, we did not measure visual and spatial abilities that might be influenced by sign language experience and that might be important for the EF development of hearing native signers. Moreover, future investigations on bilingual cognitive control might include measures of code switching and code blending used by bimodal bilinguals; in particular, switching and blending based on external constraints would be of interest.

# Conclusion

It is currently unclear if bimodal bilingualism has beneficial effects on EF in children. For this reason, we investigated the cognitive control skills of bimodal bilingual children, compared to unimodal bilingual and monolingual peers. The three groups of children had similar memory skills and cognitive flexibility capacity. However, we observed a different pattern of conflict resolution in bimodal bilinguals when compared to monolingual children, suggesting possible effects of bimodal bilingualism on conflict resolution capacity. It is also possible that visual-spatial language experience modifies conflict resolution skills in bimodal bilingual children. Future studies are needed to investigate more precisely the specific bimodal bilingual language experience, particularly of mixing languages in different modalities, that might be associated with cognitive control benefits.
