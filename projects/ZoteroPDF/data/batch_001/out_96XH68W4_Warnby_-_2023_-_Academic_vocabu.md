English academic vocabulary knowledge is needed for reading in many internationalized university contexts around the world. However, our knowledge is limited regarding the degree to which pre-tertiary education prepares students for the academic English reading demands at university. To explore this question, this cross-sectional study analyzed academic vocabulary scores from two Swedish student samples $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { N } = 9 5 2 )$ , at the beginning and at the end of upper secondary English education. Statistical analyses were conducted to describe and compare the academic vocabulary knowledge in the two samples, also in relation to gender, study disciplines and English grades. Large variations in vocabulary scores were observed within and between samples. The exit-sample outperformed the entry-sample. The exit-sample's academic vocabulary knowledge correlated positively with English grades, however, these (CEFR-B2) students do not, on average, reach suggested mastery thresholds of academic vocabulary knowledge. A logistic regression analysis showed higher probabilities for male students and Arts/Humanities/Science/ Technology students than female and Economics/Social science students to reach suggested mastery thresholds. This unequal distribution of academic word knowledge is discussed in the context of curricular goals about equality and university-preparation.

# 1. Introduction

As English is the undisputed international language in academic settings (e.g., Mauranen, Hynninen, & Ranta, 2016), proficiency in English for academic purposes (EAP) i critically important for any student wanting to be succesful (Basturkmen, 2021; Pecorarit al. 2011). To this end, vocabulary knowledge is suggested to be the major factor in explaining variation in language performance" and, by extension, in explaining academic achievement (Masrai & Milton, 2018, p. 46,).

Academic vocabulary is in this regard an essential part of students' lexical repertoire (Nagy & Townsend, 2012) and is widely considered crucial for coping with educational tasks (Coxhead, 2016). Academic vocabulary, which is diferent from disciplinary vocabulary, constutes a dimension of words that are typically academic in nature as they are frequently used in academic discourse without being discipline-specific (Coxhead, 2000, 2016; Gardner & Davies, 2014). Academic vocabulary makes up a substantial proportion of the words in academic texts, approximately $1 0 { - } 1 4 \%$ of the words, more in certain disciplines and/or genres (Therova, 2020). It is generally accepted that readers need to know about $9 5 { - } 9 8 \%$ of the running words in a text to understand the text (Laufer &

Ravenhorst-Kalovski, 2010; Nation, 2013). Thus, knowledge of academic vocabulary is critical.

Since students may encounter academic English already before tertiary level education scholars have argued that there is a dearth of \*research in EAP concerning the academic language needs, sills and texts used in schoo settings" (Basturkmen, 2021 p. 7). To address this gap in research, this study explores 952 pre-tertiary Swedish students' scores on the Academic Vocabulary Test (AVT; Pecorari et a., 2019) before and after mandatory English upper-secondary education; the scores were also investigated in relation to programme orientatio, students gender and course grades. Additionall, the findings i this study, where large differences in academic word knowledge were observed within and between samples, willbe discussed regarding issues of equality expressed in the Swedish Education Act (SFS 2010:800) and the national curriculum (NAE, 2013).

# 2. Background

# 2.1. Geographical and educational context

English holds a strong position in Sweden (where this study i situated) and its ubiquitous presence throughout the society suggests it may be considered a second language (L2) rather than a foreign language (FL) (Hult, 2012; Philipsson, 1992). Generally, Swedes are good at and wiling tospeak Englis (e.g, EF Educatio First, 2020; European Commission, 2012). In the case of adolescents, the high level of proficiency could be atributable to their extensive extramural English involvement. Extramural English involvement rfers to out-of-clas exposure and interaction with English via, for example, non-dubbed movies, audio-visual input with or without subtitles, gaming, English texts online or in print (Sundqvist & Sylven, 2016).

The increased use of English isalso reflected across academic disciplines - especially as a reading language (Kuteeva, 2014; Malmstrom & Pecorari, 2022; Pecorari et al., 2011). Many Swedish universty students state that the most important assgned course literature is in English (Shaw & McMillion, 2011), and a significant proportion of the required reading at Swedish universities is English (Malmstrom & Pecorari, 2022). Almost one third of allstudy programmes and courses at Swedish universties have adopted English as the medium of instruction (EMI). However, in undergraduate courses where Swedish is the medium of instruction, English texts are also highly prevalent; in fact, on average, every second item in the reading lists of Swedish-medium courses is written in English (Malmstrom & Pecorari, 2022). For these reasons, a high level of receptive academic English proficiency is needed by all students enrolling at Swedish universities.

Six Swedish national upper-secondary programmes (Art, Economics, Humanities, Natural sciences, Social sciences and Technology) provide eligibilit to universty, and it is the chool's responsibility that every student has sufficient knowledge to be well prepared for studies in higher education (NAE, 2013,p.8). However, the sylabi for the subject of English give no explicit instructions about what such university preparation comprises in terms of specific language skill, for example, knowledge of academic lexis (Warnby & Lemmouh, 2021). All upper secondary Swedish students take two mandatory English courses; the same syllabi apply irrespective of study programme. The syllabi for English build on the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) and are linked to the CEFR-levels (NAE, 2021a) (Fig. 1). For instance, the final mandatory course, English 6, is equivalent to a CEFR-B2 level (NAE, 2021a). The English syllabi, in line with the CEFR, assume meaning-focused and functional language instruction (NAE, 2021a) witha communicative language teaching (CLT) approach. In agreement with what is sated in the syllabi, teachers state that they rely on incidental vocabulary lening insted of focused vocabulary instruction (Bergstrom et al., 2021). Since academic vocabulary is not an explicit leaning outcome, i remains unknown what the English academic vocabulary knowledge is among Swedish CEFR-2 English learners and whether there is variation in this knowledge between upper-secondary students from diffrent university-preparatory programmes.

Upper-secondary schooling in Sweden builds on equality and a compensatory policy expressed in the Education Act and the Na tional currculum for upper-secondary education. The Swedish Education Act (SFs, 2010) postulates that the education in all schools should be equivalent and that schooling should counterbalanceall individual students' conditions of absorbing the education (1 Ch, 4). This is rflectd in the national curriculum where th SwedishNational Agency for Education (NAE, 2013) state that ces to and opportunity to learn and succeed in education should be equivalent irespective f ircumstances uncontrollableby individuals (NAE, 2013, p. 5). However, "equivalent education does not mean that teaching should be the same everywhere (NAE, 2013, p. 5). Insted. students' \*varying circumstances, needs and [..] level of knowledge" must be taken into account in relation to the national learning goals (Ch. An equivalent education, p. 5). Therefore "(s)pecial attention must be given to those students who for different reasons experience difficulties in attaning these goals (NAE, 2013, p. 5). One such nationally regulated goal states that the upper-secondary education shall prepare all individual students for higher education and shll ssure that all students "acquire goo knowledge [.. and can use this knowledge for further studies (Ch. Goals, p. 8). This means becoming prepared for Swedish university studies where "English is an ineluctable resource for scientific communication (Salo, 2016, p.4). A passing grade from the final mandatory English6 course (or, put differently, English skills at the CEFR-B2 level) seems to be the expected standard for this preparation.

Despite their widely acclaimed general English proficiency, there is reason to question the academic English proficiency among adolescents in Sweden (and in other Nordic countries). For instance, there are indications of low levels of academic reading comprehension (e.g., Edgarsson, 2018; Hellekjaer, 2005) and poor academic writing ability (e.g., Lehmann, 199; Olsson, 2016). Moreover, many university students express negative emotions regarding reading English texts to the extent that they avoid reading them (e.g, Pecorari t l., 2011). Additionall, students preparednessfor academic studies has been contested with respect to their general academic literacy (e.g., NAE, 2005; Swedish Schools Inspectorate, 2015). According to 1,600 Swedish university teachers (NAE, 2005), a key prior knowledge area for novice university students is the aility to read and understand texts and to master English; the surveyed teachers have also perceived a general decrease in students' academic language proficiency. Altogether, these indications raise questions regarding pre-tertiary students' proficiency in EAP, with respect to (general) academic vocabulary knowledge.

# 2.2. Academic vocabulary

Academic vocabulary is an important construct for a number of reasons. First, as vocabulary knowledge is a key predictor of reading ability (e.g., Laufer & Ravenhorst-Kalovski, 2010; Staehr, 2008) so has academic vocabulary knowledge been positively associated with academic reading comprehension (e.g., Edgarsson, 2018; Shaw & McMillion, 2011 Soffelsma et al, 2020). Second, academic vocabulary is likewise positively related to academic achievement in lower secondary and tertiary education (Masrai & Milton, 2018; Stoffelsma et al., 2020; Townsend et al., 2016), and Skjelde and Coxhead (2020) found that academic vocabulary test scores predicted upper-secondary grade achievement in English. Acknowledging the differences in the explanatory power of academic vocabulary in previous studies and the role of a large overallexicon, Masrai and Milton (2018) conclude that academic vocabulary knowledge plays an important role in \*the lengthy and difficult proces of mastering the scale of lexicon needed to handle academic discourse' (p. 55).

Because academic vocabulary is an important construct, research has explored possible sources for acquring knowledge of this lexis. For example, academic vocabulary and extramural English (e.g, watching non-factual programmes/videos without captions, reading fiction, gaming) have been shown to positively correlate (Warnby, 2022); in addition, gender differences have been observed where males, in relation to females, exhibit a larger academic lexicon (attributed to their higher extramural English involvement, see Sylven & Ohlander, 2019; Warnby, 2022). Given extensive extramural English exposure, genres of general English (e.g., fiction, TV programmes, movies) may offer sufficientl repeated ocurrences of academic vocabulary to enable incidental learning (., Green 2020, 2022; McQuillan, 2019). Moreover, in relation to incidental academic vocabulary learning, Freimuth (2020) tested international students (from India, the Middle East, and China) before and after a capstone foundation course in Canada and found their academic vocabulary to incidentally increase as an effect of one-semester meaning-focused academic reading.

Since academic lexis is a central dimension of academic texts (Therova, 2020) this means that any student inevitably would encounter this vocabulary that occurs across a range of academic subjects" (Coxhead, 2016, p. 177). However, different oper. ationalizations of this lexis have led to several academic word lists. Among these lists, the Academic Word List (AwL) by Coxhead (2000) and the Academic Vocabulary List (AVL) by Gardner and Davies (2014) arethe best known. Although the basis of the AWL and the AVL are slightly different, thereis an overlap of words and, \*in terms of overall word frequency, list ifferences are actually negligible (Hartshorn & Hart, 2016, p. 81). Moreover, tests of knowledge of the words in the two lists suggest that they share one overarching mutual domain (Warnby et a., in pres), namely a vocabulary of Englis for general academic purposes. Iti important to note that knowledge of AWL and AVL words may correlate positively with knowledge of general vocabulary knowledge to a certain extent since AWL and AVL words are mainly spread across the 1K-10K frequency range (see Appendix 1). For adequate reading comprehension of a variet of texts, knowledge of word families up to somewhere around the 9K-10K frequency levels may be advised (e.g., Milton and Treffers-Daller, 2013; Nation, 2006; 2013; Schmitt et l., 2017). However, for upper-intermediate (e.g, CEFR-B2) English learners (expected to know high-frequency words) preparing for universty but stil undecided about their disciplinary path, it may be more relevant to focus ther ffort on leaning academic vocabulary rather than words within the same frequency range that are not typical acrossacademic discilines. For example, one of the top 500 AVL words - selection - is ranked 5,043 in frequency and is surrounded by the non-academic words screwdriver' (5,041), scuba' (5,042), shell (5,044) and sincerely' (5,045) (Snauwaert & Voisin, 2019). For such reasons, Hartshorn and Hart (2016) state that \*it seems that many universty-bound and first-year students may benefit from a systematic study of core academic vocabulary' (p. 72).

Notwithstanding the importance of general and disciplinary word knowledge (Coxhead, 2016) and despite some criticism towards the utility of academic vocabulary (Hyland & Tse, 2007), the large number of academic vocabulary studies speaks for the collectively perceived relevancy of this construct. Thus, the assumption that academic vocabulary knowledge is important as a preparation for university studies is reasonable.

# 2.3. Academic vocabulary tests and mastery thresholds

Vocabulary is widely considered an important area to be included in tests of EAP (e.g., Gu & Youngsoon, 2015) and academic lexis occurs in both receptive and productive universty admission tests (Paribakht & Webb, 2016). Within the vocabulary testing field, two meaning-recognition tests exist which measure the written receptive English academic vocabulary knowledge of the AWL and the AVL respectively. When revising the Vocabulary Levels Test (V), Schmitt e al. (2001) included an academic section (henceforth, VLT-Ac) with 30 target words sampled from the AWL. The Academic Vocabulary Test (AVT), developed by Pecorari et al. (2019), tets 57 words from the AVL. Pecorari et al. (2019) administered the AVT (Form 2) to 455 undergraduate students in English studies at Swedish universities, recorded a mean score of 41.04 $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { S D } = 1 0 . 7$ ; Cronbach's alpha $=$ .91), but stated that \*the test has the potential to be useful with different, or les homogeneous, populations" (p. 64). Due to ceiling effects with the VLT-Ac in the context of independent EFL learners with high English exposure (e.g., Busby, 2020; Edgarsson, 2018; kelde & Coxhead, 2020), it has been suggested that the AVT is a more appropriate instrument to administer (in press).

Thresholds for mastery of the underlying construct have been suggested for VLT scores, for instance, the threshold of $8 6 . 7 \%$ percentage score correct (Schmitt et al., 2001) and the $9 6 . 7 \%$ -threshold (Webb et al., 2017). Although subsequent research suggests that the $8 6 . 7 \%$ level may be too low (Schmitt et al., 2011), it has been widely used (e.g., Edgarsson, 2018; Henriksen & Danelund, 2015; Skjelde & Coxhead, 2020). McLean (2021) criticizes the $8 6 . 7 \%$ threshold because of the few empirically based arguments that this threshold is sufficient for a learner to comprehend $9 8 \%$ of the words in a text. Such reasoning can also be seen in the work of Skjelde and Coxhead (2020), who argued for the higher $9 6 . 7 \%$ threshold with the VLT-Ac in their context since "academic vocabulary is needed by L2 English students seeking higher education and the higher level of $9 6 . 7 \%$ mastery would indicate a fuller knowledge of this lexis' (p. 106). According to them, VLT-Ac scores beneath that threshold \*indicate the extent to which leaners and teachers need to focus on goals for academic vocabulary learning (Skjelde & Coxhead, 2020, p.6). However, when exploring VLT-Ac scores together with scores on academic reading tasks, Edgarsson (2018, p. 106) argued that the lower threshold may be used for the VLT-Ac as a minimum of receptive knowledge of academic words in English for basic comprehension of academic texts. Such suggested mastery thresholds have been lacking for the AVT, but in a linking study using Item Response Theory, scores on the AVT were calibrated with scores on the academic section of the VLT showing that an AVT score of 32 is approximately equivalent to the lower $8 6 . 7 \%$ threshold on the VLT-Ac, and that the higher $9 6 . 7 \%$ threshold on the VLT-Ac approximately corresponds to an AVT score within the 42-49 points range (Warnby et al., in press).

# 2.4. Estimates of upper-secondary EFL learners' academic vocabulary knowledge

Measures of learners academic vocabulary knowledge have been reported on a variety of populations of English L2/LF learners, for example, universt students in China (Zhou, 2010) Saudi Arabia (Masrai & Milton, 2018), Norway (Busby, 2020), Ghana (Stoffelsma et al., 2020) and other countries (e.g., Gyllstad, 2007; Pecorari et al., 2019; Schmit e l., 2001), or immersion and non-mmersion students in Hong Kong (Lo & Murphy, 2010) and in Sweden (Sylven & Ohlander, 2019), or middle-school learners in Germany (Coxhead & Boutorwick, 2018) or in California (Townsend & Collins, 2009), to name a few. For the purpose of ths study, research carried out among uper-secondary students in a Nordic context is intersting for number f reasons: they are leaners ) in a majority language context closely related to English i) with ample exposure to extramural English i)subjected to EFL instruction based on meaning-focused CLT language curricula, and, last but not least, v following study programmes preparing them for university.

Five previous studies in the Nordic context have investigated upper-secondary EFL learners' academic English vocabulary knowledge; in all cases the instrument used was the VLT-Ac (see Table 1, which also includes a reference to the two mastery thresholds). Henriksen and Danelund (2015) concluded that the academic vocabulary knowledge was very poor among their 29 Danish 12th graders with only $3 1 . 0 1 \%$ reaching the lower $8 6 . 7 \%$ -threshold after the final English course at upper-secondary school. In a larger $( \mathrm { N } = 4 1 7 .$ ) Icelandic study, Edgarsson (2018) observed a percentage mean VLT-Ac score of $8 3 . 9 \%$ which is below the lower $8 6 . 7 \%$ threshold. Despite a large standard deviation indicating many high-performing students and, consequently, many students with a "disquieting" (Edgarsson, 2018, p. 109) level of academic word knowledge, Edgarsson claimed that the average Icelandic upper-secondary student does not have "adequate knowledge for good understanding of the kind of vocabulary that is prevalent in academic language" after final English instruction (p. 107). A similar pattern was found when Skjelde and Coxhead (2020) analyzed VLT-Ac scores among 134 Norwegian upper-secondary students \*taking college preparatory courses, including their final obligatory English course, before qualifying for university studies' (p. 9). They observed a mean score of $8 0 . 7 8 \%$ which correlated moderately with final English grades $( \mathbf { r } _ { s } = 0 . 3 7 )$ . However, they deepened the analysis to include both the $8 6 . 7 \%$ and the $9 6 . 7 \%$ thresholds. Of their sample, $4 1 . 7 9 \%$ reached the lower threshold and only $8 \%$ was within the higher mastery level. In a smaller but longitudinal Swedish sample of 52 EFL leaners in upper-secondary programmes, Sylven and Ohlander (2019 found that the mean percentagescore on the VLT-Ac in the first year of upper-secondary was $5 9 . 5 2 \%$ $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { S D } = 1 8 . 1 \% )$ and that it had dropped three years after to $M = 5 7 . 1 4 \%$ Their results corroborated earlier research (Gyllstad, 2007) where lower VLT-Ac scores also were observed among final $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 8 \right)$ ) as opposed to first-year $( \mathtt { n } = 2 6 )$ Swedish upper-secondary samples and where the mean percentage score among final year students was

$6 0 . 6 7 \%$

To summarize these findings, the trend is that the majority of Nordic upper-secondary EFL students' VLT-ac scores fallbelow the lower mastery threshold of $8 6 . 7 \%$ and, in the two Swedish studies, students do not seem to develop their academic lexicon during the years in upper secondary education. However, the sample sizes in the reviewed studies, except for Edgarsson (2018), may be toosmall to draw any far-reaching conclusions, especiall if one wants to investigate underlying patterns with other variables, for example, gender (Sylven & Ohlander, 2019),course grades (Skjelde & Coxhead, 2020) or lexical development during upper-secondary years (Gyllstad, 2007; Henriken & Danelund, 2015; Sylven & Ohlander, 2019) Furthermore, differences in academic vocabulary knowl. edge in relation to students' choice of study discipline remain to be explored.

# 3. Aim and RQs

The aim of the present study is to explore the English academic vocabulary knowledge that Swedish upper-secondary EFL students exhibit before and after the two years of mandatory English courses providing preparation for university studies, and whether variation in background factors (gender, study programmes, and English grades) may affect academic vocabulary knowledge observed after completion of the last mandatory English course. The study builds on two assumptions: i) English academic reading proficiency is required already at tertiary entry level, and i) academic vocabulary knowledge is an essential part f such proficiency. Four research questions guide the investigation:

RQ1. What is the written receptive English academic ocabulary knowledge among upper-secondary students when they start and finish mandatory EFL instruction providing eligibility to higher education?

RQ2. Are there any differences in academic vocabulary knowledge between firs-year and final-year students and with regard to gender and study disciplines?

RQ3. Among final-year students, how are academic vocabulary scores and grades from the final English course correlated?

RQ4. Do gender, study discipline and/or English entrance grades afect the probabilities for an upper-secondary (CEFR-B2 EFLstudent to reach suggested mastery thresholds of receptive English academic vocabulary?

# 4. Method

# 4.1. Participants and instruments

A total of 998 students (two sample across 44class in nine upper-secondary schools) accepted the invitation to participate. All six national programmes (Art, Economics, Humanities, Natural ciences, Social sciences, and Technology) were represented by at least two schools per programme.

All test-takers were administered an academic vocabulary test together with a background survey collecting self-reported infor. mation on a number of questions such as gender, study programme, final English grade in compulsory schol (school year 9), and English grade in the final upper-secondary mandatory course (English 6). The self-reported grades were combined with the schools registered grade data when available.

In this study, Form 2 of the Academic Vocabulary Test (AVT) (Pecorari et al., 2019) was used to test the students knowledge of written receptive academic vocabulary knowledge. The AVT contains 19 clusters, each with three definitions to be matched withthree target words from a list of six alternatives (se Fig. 2). Altogether, the AVT measures knowledge of 57 target words (maximum score $=$ 57) sampled from the AVL and icrementally ordered so that more frequent words occur first e., generate, perceive, ccess and less frequent towards the end (e.g, soundness monopolistic, parsimonious) (see Pecorari et al. (2019) for a technical description).

Twenty-one students either left the vocabulary test blank or were judged not to have fully' participated. These individuals were excluded. Fivestudents having fuly or partly atended an EMI compulsory chool were excluded, as were 20 students reporting having English as L1 or one of their L1s. Thus, the analyzed dataset contained data from 952 participants, of which 526 had just entered uppersecondary (henceforth 'entry-sample') and 426 had just passed through the last mandatory English course prior to universty (henceforth 'exit-sample'). The average age for the entry-sample was 16.04 ( $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 3 0 $ ) and for the exit-sample 18.07 ( $\mathrm { \Sigma } ^ { \mathrm { S D } } = 0 . 2 9$ . Due to school lockdowns during Covid-19 and time constraints within the research project, a cross-sectional design was used with two

different samples instead of a longitudinal design.

The entry-sample had received on average seven years (equivalent to about $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { h } )$ of English instruction. They had completed compulsory school with an English grade corresponding to the CEFR-B1 level, and just started the first course, English 5. The exit sample had on average received nine years of English instruction, corresponding to approximately $6 5 0 ~ \mathrm { h } ^ { 2 }$ of English instruction. They had passed the English 6 course equivalent to the CEFR-B2 level. Table 2 reports on the distribution of the participants.

Since there were fewer males and fewer Economics and Arts students in the exit-sample than in the entry-sample, comparisons may be affected. However, the overall goal was to reach a total number of included students per sample that corresponds well to the "minimum of 400students per task" used within the wedish national system of assesment f foreign languages (Erickson et al., 2022, p. 6).

# 4.2. Data analysis

All data were processed using IBM SPS version 28. Allresponses on the AVT were binary scored using the lenient approach suggested by Warnby et al. (In pres). The AVT-score distribution for the entry-sample is sightly positiely skewed whereas the score distribution for the exit-sample can be considered normal (ee graphs in Appendix 2). The Cronbach's alpha for the entry-sample is ${ \mathfrak { Q } } =$ 0.94, and for the exit-sample $\alpha = . 9 3$

For the first research question, descriptive statistics were compiled to present the observed AVT-scores in the two samples s well a in the sub-samples study programme and gender.

For the second research question, independent T-tests were used to check differences between samples and sub-samples

For the third research question, only the AVT-scores in the exit-sample were used and corrlated with the students pasing grades in the final English course, English 6, going from  (lowest grade) to A (highest). From the exit-sample, 413 participants self-reported their final grade in English 6. From the school register (when avalable) the corresponding grades were obtained for 288 participants. The correlation between the self-reported and the school registered grades in English 6 was $r =$ .95, $p < . 0 0 1$ $( \mathtt { n } = 2 8 8 )$ . This ensured the reliability and the valid use of the self-reported scores. To validate the use of self-reported grades, a correlation was also made between the AVT-scores and the register grades.

For the fourth research question, also focusing on the exit-sample, two dependent dummy variables were first computed based on the AVT-scores.In the first dependent variable (DV1), al students having a score above 31 corresponding to the lower VLT mastery threshold of $8 6 . 7 \%$ were coded as 1; In the second dependent variable (DV2), it was decided that all students getting a score above 44, approximately corresponding to the higher $9 6 . 7 \%$ VLT mastery threshold, were coded as 1 (for a technical description of the suggested thresholds, ee Warnby et al. (In press). Table 3 describes the distribution of the number of students reaching the lower and the higher AVT-thresholds. In total, 198 $( 4 8 \% )$ out of 414 participants reached the lower threshold whereas 45 $( 1 1 \% )$ participants reached the higher threshold. Table 3 also shows that there are participants reaching the threshold in all variable cells.

Thereafter, two binary logistic regression analyses were conducted using the DV1 in the first model and the DV2 in the second model. Three factors were used. Firstly, a dumm variable, Gender, was made with female as the reference group. Scondly, combined groups of study programmes were entered as dummy IVs: Economics and Social sciences (Eco-S) were grouped together; Technology and Natural sciences (Tech-NS) were grouped together, Arts and Humanities (Art-Hum) were grouped together. In all analyses, the Eco-SS group was used as the reference group. Thirdly, the variable English grade year 9 included five grade intervals. Since only six students reported having obtained the lowest grade, E, in year 9, just before entering upper-secondary education, this grade was collapsed with the grade above, D.The new grade variable was used in the model to account for English proficincy differences prior to upper-secondary admission. In a first exploration of the data all IVs were entered, and no statisticall significant interaction $( p >$ .10) was found for any combination of the three IVs. The variable English grade year 9 was tested a priori to check that there was no violation of the linearit assumption. The assumption of multicollinearity was checked and thereis no clear dependency between predictors. In the logistic regression models, the hypothesis is that the log odds for reaching the mastery thresholds increase with statistical significance for an individual not belonging to the reference group.

# 5. Results

5.1. The academic vocabulary knowledge among upper-secondary students when they start and finish mandatory EFL instruction

Table 4 presents the overall results for each sample and sub-sample. The mean vocabulary score for the entry-sample is 22.45 $\mathbf { S D = }$ 11.89) and the corresponding mean score for the exit-sample is 31.02 ( $\mathrm { \mathop { S D } } = 1 1 . 6 6 \mathrm { \mathop { ) } }$ . In Appendix 3, boxplots are used to visualize the results.

The large variation, seen in the standard deviation, means, for example, that approximately two thirds of the entry-sample participants score between around 11 and 34 points.

5.2. Diffrences in academic vocabulary knowledge among upper-secondary students between first-year and final-year students as well as between gender and study programmes

The score average difference between the entry-sample and the exit-sample (Table 4) is statistically significant $( t ( 9 5 0 ) = 1 1 . 1 6 , p$ $< . 0 0 1 $ ) with a large effect size (Cohen's $d = 0 . 7 2 7 )$ . The average scores within the entry-sample are significantly higher for males than for females (Table 4), albeit with a small effect size $( t ( 5 2 3 ) = 2 . 7 1$ $p < . 0 1$ ; Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 3 7 \mathrm { ; }$ ; the same is true for the exit-sample with a medium effect size $( t ( 4 2 4 ) = 5 . 6 3$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; Cohen's $d = 0 . 5 1 3$

Independent T-tests were also performed between the entry-sample and the exit-sample separated by study disciplines. Allvalues were significant $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ . Among the six disciplines, the Economics and the Social sciences programmes had the lowest mean scores both before and afer EFL courses (Table 4). However, these two programmes were also the ones showing the largest development with an increase of more than $5 0 \%$ , which was more than twice as high compared to the Technology programme $( 2 3 \% )$ . Despite this apparent increase, they were still far from the full sample mean: The Social science exit-sample's mean score $( M = 2 5 . 0 1$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 1 . 2 $ was about half astandard deviation below the fullsample mean. The highest scoring students in both year groups were found in the Humanities programme. Already at the beginning of upper-secondary EFL instruction, they performed better $( M = 3 1 . 7 2$ $\mathrm { S D } = 9 . 4 5 $ than the full sample did after two years of upper-secondary EFL instruction $\langle M = 3 1 . 0 2 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 1 . 6 6 \AA$ . The Humanities students' mean exit score was 40.8 (9.45), which is almost one standard deviation above the exit-sample mean. The Technology programme had mean results above the mean of each sample but showed the smallest lexical growth.

# 5.3. The relationship between AVT-scores and grades from final English course (CEFR-B2)

The correlation between the AVT-score and the self-reported final English grade $( \mathrm { N } = 4 1 3$ ) by Pearson correlation coefficient was moderate $r = . 6 3 ( p < . 0 0 1 )$ and slightly stronger when correlating the AVT-score with school register grades $( \mathrm { N } = 2 8 8 )$ $r = . 6 6 ( p <$ .001). Thus, the AVT-scores share a substantial amount of the variation (approximately $4 0 { - } 4 3 \%$ with the grades in the final course, English 6, equivalent to CEFR-B2.

5.4. Effect of gender and choice of study discipline on the probabilit of mastering written receptive English academic vocabulary

Two binary logistic models were fitted onto the exit-sample data $( \mathrm { N } = 4 1 4 )$ to investigate the probability for reaching the lexical thresholds for different groups of students ater the completion of the last mandatory English course providing eligibility to university (Table 5). Out of the 414 subjects in the exit-sample, 198 $( 4 8 \% )$ reached the lower threshold and 45 $( 1 1 \% )$ reached the higher threshold (Table 3 above).

For the first model using DV1, the regression model with the IVs was significantly better than the intercept model $( \chi 2 = 1 8 5 . 4 3$ , df $= 4 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ with an increase in percentage correctly predicted outcome, from $5 2 . 2 \%$ to $7 6 . 6 \%$ (Nagelkerke $= 0 . 4 8$ $_ { \mathrm { C o x - S n e l l } } =$ 0.36). The Hosmer-Lemeshow $( \chi 2 = 2 . 6 3 , \mathrm { d f } = 7 , p < . 9 1 7 )$ test was not significant thus indicating that the model fits the data well. The second model using DV2 resulted in the same pattern, with better model fit with IVs than the null-model without IVs $( \chi 2 =$ 56.67, $\mathsf { d f } = 4 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ and with an expected non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test $( \chi 2 = 5 . 1 1$ $\mathrm { d f } = 8$ $p < . 7 4 6 )$ . However, the percentage correctly predicted outcome did not change between the null-model and the regression model $8 9 . 1 \%$ in both models) (Nagelkerke $= 0 . 2 6$ $\mathrm { C o x } { \cdot } \mathrm { S n e l l } = 0 . 1 3 )$ . The confidence intervals of the odds ratio (OR) are rather large which may influence the number of correctly predicted values.

Turning to the outcomes of the logistic regression analyses, it i good to remember the reference group, namely female students in Economics/Social Sciences programmes entering upper secondary education with one of the two lowest English grades (E/D) from compulsory school year 9. The results indicated that a male student in the Economics/Social Sciences programme was 3.45 times more likely than his female peer to reach the lower threshold $( 0 \mathrm { R } = 3 . 4 5 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ and 4.15 times more likely to reach the higher threshold $( \mathrm { O R } = 4 . 1 7 $ $p \ : < \ : . 0 0 1 \dot { . }$ , given that the students entered upper-secondary education with the same English grade from compulsory school.

The results further indicated that students belonging to any programme other than the reference group programme (Economics - Social Sciences) had about 4-6 times higher probability of scoring within the lower threshold: Arts-Humanities $( \mathrm { O R } = 4 . 0 1 $ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ Technology-Natural Sciences $\mathbf { \mathrm { O R } } = 4 . 5 5$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ . The same is true for the higher threshold: Arts-Humanities $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { T } = 5 . 8$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ Technology-Natural Sciences $\mathbf { \hat { O } R } = 3 . 9 7 $ $p < . 0 0 5 \mathrm { \AA }$

If students of the same gender and programme received one level higher in English grade year 9, this would correspond to a 3.47 times higher probability of scoring within the lower threshold $\mathbf { \mathrm { O R } } = 3 . 4 7 $ $p < . 0 0 1 $ and a 2.49 times higher probability of reaching the higher threshold ( $\mathbf { \vec { O R } } = 2 . 4 9$ $p < . 0 0 1 $

# 6. Discussion

This study set out to explore the English academic vocabulary knowledge Swedish EFL upper-secondary students exhibit at the beginning of the first mandatory English course (entry-sample) and afer the final mandatory English courses (exit-sample), and how variation in background factors (gender, study discipline, and course grades) relates to knowledge of and mastery of academic vo. cabulary. The overall finding istht, although the upper secondary students academic word knowledge is low on average, with a large variation constituted by both high-performing and low-performing students within and between groups, there are unequal probabilities for different groups of students to reach academic vocabulary mastry thresholds. The discussion in this section wil mainly revolve around this variation and these group differences.

As described previously, this study is based on two main assumptions: i) proficiency in EAP is a necessary requirement for entry level tertiary students - especially academic reding aility, i) academic vocabulary is crucial component of academic literacy. For this reason it s arued that scores on academic vocabulary tests may provide an indication of the extent to which students il be able to cope with English reading tasks at university. It must be acknowledged that reading comprehension isa complex construct involving many aspects, such as content knowledge, motivation to read and reading strategies; therefore, vocabulary test scores should not be seen as representative of the full reading comprehension construct. However, as mentioned previousl, generall, areader needs to have a lexical coverage of approximately $9 5 { - } 9 8 \%$ of the words in a text to comprehend the text (e.g., Nation, 2013). Furthermore, it has been claimed by Therova (2020) and others that $1 0 { - } 1 4 \%$ of the words in academic texts belong to academic vocabulary. A high AVT score may indicate that academic lexis will not be of any particular hindrance to academic reading comprehension. Conversely, low-scoring AVT test-takers are likely to frequently encounter unknown academic words in their academic reading and this might increase the lexical burden, possibly to the extent that they even stop reading in English (e.g., Pecorari et al., 2011).

From these assumptions, we now turn to some of the findings showing the large variation in academic vocabulary knowledge within and between groups. For instance, the entry-sample had a significantly lower average score than the exit-sample. Although this is a cross-ctional study, the relatvely lare sample size (952 indviduals, 44 clases, 9 schools) is arguably enough to suggest that the receptive academic lexicon increases during the two years of Swedish upper-secondaryschooling. This inding diffr from the nongrowth results oserved in previous Swedish studies where, however, the samples were substantially smaller Sylven & Ohlander. 2019: longtdinal, 52 indviduals, 3 clases 2 schools; Gyllstd, 2007: cos-sectional, 54 individuals, 2 clases, 1 school. Despite this apparent academic vocabulary development, there is a large variation in vocabulary scores and in threshold probabilities between groups of students, not least across disciplines. For example, a student belonging to Arts/Hum./NS/Tech. is much more likely to reach suggested mastery thresholds than a student in Eco./S. even when accounting for prior grades. Furthermore, a male student is more likely to exhibit a higher score and reach a threshold than a female student.

Looking at the academic word knowledge in the exit-sample, paralls can be drawn to previous research in similar contexts. The positive correlation between AVT-scores and English course grades $( r = . 6 3 )$ supports the relationship between VLT-Ac scores and English grades found in Norway (Skjelde & Coxhead, 2020). The explained variation in AVT-scores by grades is interesting since academic vocabulary is not part of any expected learning outcome or instructional content in the sllabi for upper-secondary English courses. However, the correlation indicates how academic vocabulary may be asociated with academic achievement (see Townsend et al., 2016) and with higher linguistic order, given that the higher grades, in comparison to lower grades, are seen as indicators of stronger linguistic competence (see Skjelde & Coxhead, 2020).

With regard to the lower and higher AVT-thresholds equivalent to the $8 6 . 7 \%$ and $9 6 . 7 \%$ VLT mastery levels, the CEFR-B2 students (exit-sample) in the current study displayed results that recal previous research in the Nordic context In kjelde and Coxhead (2020) only $8 \%$ of the Norwegian participants reached the higher threshold, a finding which is reflected in this study $( 1 1 \% )$ . This is not as worrisome as the fact that the majority $( 5 2 \% )$ of these CEFR-B2 students do not even reach the lower threshold. This finding aligns with similar figures in the relatively large samples from Norway (Skjelde & Coxhead, 2020) and Iceland (Edgarsson, 2018) as well as in the small studies from Denmark (Henriksen & Danelund, 2015) and Sweden (Gyllsta, 2007; Sylven & Ohlander, 2019), where, in each of the five studies, the majorit of the participants never rached the lower threshold. Based on the two assumptions above, this suggests that the low observed academic vocabulary knowledge among the majority of the CEFR-B2 students would heavily burden their academic reading fluency when at university. Furthermore, in relation to the correlation between grades and academic vocabulary knowledge, it can be questioned whether the lower achievement grades, equivalent to a lower range of CEFR-B2 lel, are indicators of proper EAP proficiency for early university education.

There may be many explanations as to why thereis a large variation in cores and, more critically, why a majorit of tudents do not reach the lower suggested threshold of academic vocabulary knowledge. First of all the past decades have shown an increase in extramural English involvement, which may support the development of academic reading comprehension (Lowenadler, 2022) and academic vocabulary (Gree, 2020, 2022; McQuillan, 2019; Warnby, 202). However, extramural English involvement differs among individuals although there are tendencies in group behaviors, for instance, male students are more frequently involved with gaming and viewing English without subtitles (e.g., Sundqvist & Sylven, 2016; Sylven & Ohlander, 2019; Warnby, 2022) which are activities positively associated with academic vocabulary knowledge (Warnby, 2022). Such behavioral differences are likely to be found in all classrooms and study disciplines and, therefore, may explain the variation within groups observed in this study.

Another possible explanation pertains to curriculum guidelines. In the name of equalit, the national curriculum aims to prepare all students for university studies (NAE, 2013). However, thesyllabi for English - grounded in a communicative language approach - have no explicit focus n teaching EAP or academic lexis (very lttle is expresed at ll aout linguistc skills. In relation to this, the low results for academic literacy skill seen in Denmark and Norway have been discussed vis-a-vis a similar over-emphasis on the CLT approach in the curriculum (e.g., Hellekjaer, 2008; Henrisen & Danelund, 2015; Lehmann, 199). Henriken and Danelund argued that in this kind of "communicatively oriented, meaning-based learning environment, it is possble that learners may not have ben encouraged to develop their vocabulary" (2015, p. 50). This holds true also for Sweden (Bergstrom et al, 2021; Olsson, 2016; Warnby & Lemmouh, 2021) and may thus be explaining not only the low levels of, but also the large variation in, academic vocabulary knowledge observed in the current study.

The large variations across disciplines prove that there are students who exhibit a robust academic word knowledge at CEFR-B2 level. Conversely, there are students in all study disciplines who display very low results. Considering that these students have opted for an upper-secondary programme responsible for providing them with solid preparation for universty studies and that their level of academic vocabulary knowledge i critially low it sems reasonable to say that EAP does not sem to be part of this university preparation. Instead if no national crricular atention in university-preparatory English courses is iven to academic language skill, such as academic vocabulary pertinent for academic reading comprehension, we cannot but expect that the probabilities of reaching the lower suggested mastery level of academic lexis will continue to depend on factors outside the intended curriculum. Since classrom practices may vary considerably within the \*fuzy nature of CLT [.. research is necessary if we are o gain a beer un. derstanding of what larners exposed to a communicative approach to language teaching are actually learning" (Graves & Garton, 2017, p. 475).

The Swedish upper secondary education is rooted in an inclusive compensatory pedagogy intended to provide preparation for higher education to all is students regardessof their backgrounds (NAE, 2013) However, nothing in the CLT-oriented English syllabi directs teachers toward preparing their students for the academic literacy skils required in higher education. In thistudy, the large variation in vocabulary scores and in mastery probabilitie can hardly be considered a fair distribution of knowledge granted that academic vocabulary constitutes one important part of academic literacy (se e.g., Alharbi, 2017; Freimuth, 2020; Stoffelsma et al., 2020). Thus, it cannot be taken for granted that this central lexical knowledge in English for general academic purposes willbe aquired within the current CLT-based currculum (see also Freimuth, 2020). This reasoning echoes the conclusion of Staehr (2008) who criticized the over-belief in incidental vocabulary learning \*from exposure to various meaning-based language tasks - an approach which seems to be preferred in the L2 classroom of Danish schools" (p. 150) It must be noted, though, that instruction in academic vocabulary is not aviable single solution for preparing for the diverse nature of academic reading literacy; a well-balanced English instruction targting academic reading literacy neds to include a focus on form as well as on meaning, for instance, as in Nation's four strands (2007). However, although academic word knowledge is not enough to guarantee successin academic meaning-based tasks, the lack of this knowledge will make academic texts incomprehensible.

As evidenced in the other reviewed Nordic studies, this study points to the need for academic lexis to be outlined as an explicit instruction area in the language curriculum. Since knowledge of academic vocabulary \*contribute[s] to the learners preparedness to handle the lexical demands of their academic studies (Paribakht & Webb, 2016, p.128),a pedagogical implication would be to make EFL teachers and learners aware of this important EAP vocabulary register by including it in the curriculum content, especill for upper-secondary programmes providing eligibility to higher education.

# 6.1. Limitations and future directions

Like in similar studies based on the kind of test format used in this study, two limitations are conditioned by the AVT. Firs, the AVT measures knowledge of only one meaning of the target academic words, which is a basic form of vocabulary knowledge (Nation, 2013). Nonetheles, the low results become even more critical when thinking of students ned for more demanding forms of word knowledge. Second, the matching format has previously been criticzed for inroducing guessing errors and inflating scores (e.g., Gyllstad et al., 2015). However, if guesing might inflate the scores, the true score of the observed low scores could be assumed to be en lower, thus increasing the need for EAP inclusion in the upper-secondary school curriculum.

Furthermore, there are limitations pertaining to the research design First, the self-reported grades used in this study especiall for RQ4) may affect the reliabilit of the connections that can be made between academic vocabulary knowledge and achievement. Information from schol rcords would be preferable. Second, a longitudinal design would have increased the reliabilit of vocabulary growth interpretations. Third, this study does not include data to connect upper-secondary students' academic vocabulary knowledge (AVT-scores) with their academic reading ability or future univerity performance. Fourth, there is no data o link students scores with actual classoom practices, that is how the intended curriculum is enacted by teachers and school. Future studies are suggested to explore, for example, the relationship between academic vocabulary and reading scores or the English literacy practices in uppersecondary education.

# 7. Conclusion

The observed diffrences in AVT-scores between EFL learners entering Swedish upper-secondary school (CEFR-B1 level) and those completing the final English course (CEFR-B2 level) suggest an improvement in academic word knowledge. However, the large variation in academic vocabulary knowledge within sub-groups and the unequal probabilities of reaching mastery thresholds in relation to gender and different study programmes indicate an unequal preparation for higher education regarding English literacy skills. The majority of exiting (CEFR-B2) students in this Swedish sample do not reach the lower suggested mastery lel of academic word knowledge. This sugests that the academic vocabulary knowledge does not correspond to the level of academic preparedness one would expect at a CEFR-B2 level, which is commonly (especiall throughout Europe) used as the university entrance requirement for foreign L2 students (e.g., Deygers et al., 2018). For this reason, it is suggested that EAP is explicitly included in the Swedish curriculum guidelines, especially in the English syllabi mandatory for upper-secondary students in university-preparatory study programmes. Academic vocabulary could be one important content of such university-preparatory English instruction.

# Appendix 1. AWL and AVL in terms of general frequency

As a way of exemplifying the spread of frequency level of the AWL and the AVL words, an analysis was performed using the VPCompleat lexical profiler tool (Cob, 2). In Table6 al the members of the WL word familie and l the AVL lemas were entered into VP-Compleat. Depending on where one sets the boundaries for high-frequency words and low-frequency words the distribution across frequency categories will clearly differ (Nation, 2013).
