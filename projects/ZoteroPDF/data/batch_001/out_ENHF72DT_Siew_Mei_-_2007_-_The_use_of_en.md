# Abstract

Recently, the interactive quality of text has been more extensively examined as finer analytical approaches and tools are developed to tease out these evaluative meanings. For instance, the engagement sub-system of the appraisal framework [Martin, J.R. (2000). Beyond exchange: Appraisal systems in English. In: Hunston, S., Thompson, G. (Eds.), Evaluation in text: Authorial stance and the construction of discourse (pp. 142–176). Oxford: Oxford University Press; White, P. (2002). The language of attitude, arguability and interpersonal positioning. Retrieved June 2002, http:// www.grammatics.com/appraisal/index.html] has provided yet another avenue through which one aspect of interaction in text, the negotiation of dialogic space, can be examined closely. The present study focuses on this aspect of interactive meaning used in undergraduate geography essays as a diversion from the concentration on professional academic texts. More importantly such meanings, though present in and central to tertiary level persuasive writing, may be more difficult to detect in less well-constructed novice texts. The investigation shows that writers of high-rated essays use certain engagement options that develop a contrastive stance strategically to bring out potential contradictions in presenting evidence. Interestingly, markers’ comments along the margin seem to encourage the negotiation of contradictory evidence. Also, options that negotiate credibility through strong endorsement by authoritative sources are preferred by these writers to options that signal lower levels of certainty in propositions made. These insights provide useful directions for specific areas to which novice writers can be alerted more concretely as they learn the ways of academic discourse.

# 1. Introduction

Over the last decade or so, researchers have challenged the salience of faceless objectivity in professional academic discourse and have argued with convincing evidence that academic writing is indeed motivated by the need for writers to persuade readers, explicitly and implicitly, to adopt certain positions. In fact, Myers (1999) highlights the primary function of the activity of writing as interaction. Evidence of textual interaction in academic discourse has emerged through various investigative approaches including genre and English for academic purpose studies (see for example Bhatia, 1993; Candlin & Plum, 1999; Hyland, 2000, 2004; Swales, 1990). Also, both researchers and practitioners seem to converge on these perspectives on academic discourse: the need to be more critically aware of the role of language in the construction of texts, writer identities and disciplinary communities and the need to view writing as a socially and culturally embedded practice (Jones, 2004). Beyond the representation of an external reality on the ideational plane, language, especially evaluative language used in socially and culturally acceptable ways, contribute to the construction of successfully interactive texts to forge, negotiate and establish social relations to build solidarity with readers. As Duszak observes, ‘‘academic discourse may not be insightfully studied with a disregard for a whole array of interpersonal meanings’’ (Duszak, 1997, p. 13).

Research into the interactive quality of academic text has mainly been confined to professional writing rather than on undergraduate writing which may not necessarily be seen as writing for an authentic academic audience (O’Brien, 1995). However, although students may not have the professional content or discourse knowledge that experts do, assignments given often require them to learn how to analyze and evaluate content knowledge, how to position themselves in disciplinary debates and to articulate that positioning in a congruent manner. The effective management of what Hood (2004, p. 24) calls evaluative stance, explained as ‘‘the ways writers position their own research in relation to other knowledge and other knowers,’’ may pose a challenge to novice writers. Furthermore, studies in EAP and genre have also shown (Dudley-Evans, 1987; Swales, 1981) the important role of an academic community’s expectations of standards and norms in the construction of a good text-types and the language used to complete the task.

This paper investigates the differentiated patterns of use of evaluative expressions in high- and low-rated geography undergraduate essays with a view of understanding possible norms expected as reflected through the grades awarded and markers’ comments along the margin. The sub-system of engagement in the appraisal framework, which is mainly concerned with how writers express their propositions with reference to potential or actual propositions made, is found to be most appropriate for this analysis.

The effectiveness of an argument will partly depend on how, and by whom, an essay is read. As an analyst with interests in pedagogy, I seek to understand the likely effects of aspects of evaluative wording upon teachers’ readings of the essays. I would not presume to either endorse or reject the assessors’ actual rankings, which are assessments of the whole essay texts within a particular task context and not of essay extracts or selected features of wording alone.

# 2. Writing practices

The importance of socio-cultural factors, including the impact of disciplinary cultures, on writing has motivated various textual analyses, corpuses and more detailed ethnographic studies of mainly professionally written disciplinary texts (see for example Hunston, 1989; Hyland, 2000; MacDonald, 1994). Studies conducted to understand the role of disciplinary culture on tertiary level writing have also been prevalent. For instance, work on academic literacy (Johns, 1997; Lea & Street, 1999; Street, 1994) explained as ‘‘y research and pedagogy associated with writing at tertiary level, particularly as it relates to making clear to all students the writing practices used in higher education’’ has been reported (Hewings, 2004, p. 133). Writing practices expected at tertiary level may be as varied as the practices that students have brought along with them. As such, Farrell, James, Carmichael, and Scoufis (1997) rightly call for the critical practices expected of students to be unmasked as students learn to write academic essays in six discipline areas.

Different approaches to unmasking these requirements include investigations into contextual factors such as the expectations of individual assessors or groups of assessors (Prior, 1995, 1998; Zhu, 2004) or the analysis of aspects of students’ texts to understand certain disciplinary features reflected that may be taken to be representative of the writing desired at that level or that discipline as a whole. For instance, Hewings (2004) compares the role of theme in first and third year geography essays in creating a stance on the message. It was found that interpersonal themes occurred more frequently in third year essays than in first year ones and this contributed to what Hewings describes as essays which recount more than just facts. In another study of texts, Dressen (2003) reports on how geologists gain recognition of expertize by transmitting the message of the experience of field culture, thereby establishing the fact that one has been engaged with the reality in the field. These findings cohere well with the value system of human geography which is increasingly being associated with quantitative methods used in the sciences with its related scientific processes of hypothesizing and validating of hypotheses through empirical evidence. Thus, good geography texts are characterized by persuasive arguments using field data to engage readers through the choice of appropriate interpersonal themes and overall presenting an evidence-based argument towards a certain hypothesis.

Other research into the interpersonal element, outside of geography, revolves around these main areas: evaluation (Hunston, 1989; Hunston & Thompson, 2000), appraisal (Martin, 2000; White, 2002), stance (Biber & Finegan, 1989) and metadiscourse (Crismore, 1989; van Kopple, 1985). Earlier studies include the examination of lists of words that are indicative of epistemic meanings or the writer’s commitment to knowledge claims (see Crismore, Markkanen, & Steffensen, 1993; Hyland & Milton, 1997; Intaraprawat & Steffensen, 1995; McEnery & Kifle, 2002).

In investigating the occurrence of these word lists, the studies narrow evaluative meanings to conveying truth validity of propositions. Also, Hunston (1989) raises the issue of the lack of defining differentiation between evaluative and non-evaluative words and shows that the latter can signal evaluative meanings in some contexts of use. Furthermore, these studies do not examine the role of evaluative language in the light of purposeful rhetorical intent with the exception of Barton’s (1993) study of experts’ and students’ use of evidentials in aspects of argumentation. Barton shows that in the introduction of an argument, in mapping the writer’s knowledge claim in relation to other people’s positions (problematisation), expert writers seem to prefer a stance that ‘‘privileges knowledge defined as a product of contrast and that values the competitive knowledge-maker characterised as an individual with a critical perspective’’ (Barton, 1993, p. 765). Student writers, however, prefer a stance of generalization.

Recent approaches to the analysis of interaction in texts, such as the appraisal framework, involve more comprehensive sets of sub-systems of options to tease out evaluative meanings at different levels. Investigations into discipline-specific texts using mainly the attitude subsystem (e.g., Coffin, 1997, 2000, 2002; Martin, 1995; Rothery & Stenglin, 2000; Unsworth, 2000; Veel, 1997) identify for instance, the importance of judgment resources in an ‘A’ grade literary essay written concerning propriety and ethical values.

The relative paucity of investigative work on novice texts does not diminish the importance of understanding students’ interpersonal literacy in texts. The need is acute when one realizes that students ‘‘are seldom told about textual conventions, principally because the rules have become second nature to their instructors who have already been initiated into disciplinary practices’’ (Johns, 1997, p. 46). This then attests to the importance of investigating interactive resources in undergraduates’ argumentative writing, even as a multiplicity of finer ways of analysis is developed to describe the nature of textual interaction.

# 3. The engagement system

The appraisal framework highlights the importance of evaluative lexis, and is organized in terms of sets of options of evaluative meanings that speakers/writers can typically use in certain contexts and the linguistic realizations of those meanings. The three major systems of attitude, graduation and engagement signal writer evaluation of a range of entities in relation to the intensity and negotiability of these assessments. The valuation of emotions, people’s behavior and the esthetic quality of things constitute the expression of attitude. Being multifaceted, the model accounts for the manipulation of the intensity of these valuations (graduation), and the dialogic space afforded for the negotiation of these values (engagement).

In this paper, however, the engagement system is used most frequently as it best describes the effective/less than effective negotiation of writer–reader interaction to create a contrastive stance in argumentation. Through the engagement system, the writer can negotiate and moderate the level of commitment to propositions made. The framework, however, emphasizes the role of engagement resources in regulating the dialogic space made available for negotiating a proposition.

Although White (2002) acknowledges that traditional classes of words (e.g., modals) transmit writer attitude, he makes the qualification that the writer’s attitude does not necessarily convey the lack of commitment to the truth-value of a proposition (epistemic meaning) as exemplified in his view by Hyland’s work (e.g., Hyland & Milton, 1997). Neither is it mainly for the face-saving purposes or politeness as exemplified in Myers’ work (e.g., Myers, 1989). White (2002) argues that the system of engagement basically recognizes the heteroglossic perspective (Bakhtin, 1986, p. 13) which emphasizes ‘‘the role of language in positioning speakers and their texts within the heterogeneity of social positions and world views which operate in any culture.’’

According to the appraisal framework, ‘‘all utterances to some degree take into account or respond to prior utterances and to some degree anticipate or acknowledge likely responses, reactions and objections from actual or potential dialogic partners’’ (White, 2002, p. 13). An utterance represents one option among a diversity of socio-semiotic realities. Those utterances that employ engagement resources acknowledge the dialogic potential of the utterance, while those that do not do so thereby deny or ignore the dialogic nature of the utterance inherent in the communicative social context. Thus, besides the truth-value indicated, engagement resources could signal the writer’s willingness to accept the negotiability of the proposition as texts are sites of interaction between writers’ and readers’ socio-semiotic realities.

The various options in the engagement system are described in Appendix A. Essentially, the options represent different degrees of acknowledgment of dialogic diversity. At the two ends of the cline, bare assertion denies dialogic diversity while utterances that are extravocalized (assigned in some manner to another source, without the writer’s endorsement) are most open to such diversity. Other options which constrict dialogic space are disclaim:deny, disclaim:counter, proclaim:endorse, proclaim:pronounce, proclaim:concur, while expansive options are entertain, attribute:acknowledge, attribute:disclaim.

# 4. The study

The main objective of this study is to examine the interactive quality of the high- and low-rated geography (henceforth GEOG) scripts using mainly the engagement system of the appraisal framework, especially in the context of a particular rhetorical style such as problematization using contrastive data. At some points though, the attitude and graduation systems may be used to help illustrate the effectiveness of the use of engagement resources. The study focuses on one aspect of undergraduate writing to further our knowledge of the discipline and to contrast writing practices of high- and lowrated scripts. A better general understanding of disciplinary expectations is gleaned from markers’ comments along the margin. An in-depth interview conducted with one of the assessors provided insights into the role of evaluation as a whole rather than details specific to the appraisal framework. As such, these interview comments are not reported here.

The research questions guiding the study are as follows:

What are some patterns of use of engagement resources in the high- and low-rated GEOG essays? $\bullet$ In what ways do engagement resources contribute to the construal of the more or less successful problematization of contrary data in the high- and low-rated essays?

The data set consists of 27 essays selected from a total of 149 GEOG essays completed by first year students at the National University of Singapore. The students are non-native speakers of English who have all scored at least a C6 grade in their General Paper1 or its equivalent. They attended a two-hour briefing on the assignment as one of the geography lecturers discussed pertinent issues including the selection of essay topics that lend themselves to survey research and the importance of using both primary and secondary data in their arguments. The papers were graded separately by two content lecturers who are non-native speakers but are highly proficient in the language as they have been trained in native speaking universities. General aspects of the marking criteria such as the need to present original arguments and research data were agreed upon between the markers. Basic organizational details such as the presentation of an introduction with a well-defined scope and argument or a conclusion which summarizes main arguments were also looked for.

Generally, there was no indication that the assessors were explicitly looking for any specific language-related criterion. Only essays scoring grades A, C and D were analyzed as the aim was to compare and contrast evaluative expressions that may have contributed to the two ends of the grade scale. The number of scripts for the highly rated (A, A) and lowly rated $( \mathbf { C } , \mathbf { D } + )$ essays is provided below:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Letter grade</td><td>A+</td><td>A</td><td>A-</td><td>C+</td><td>C</td><td>D+</td><td>D</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Number of essays</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>27</td></tr></table></body></html>

Students were asked to write a 2000-word argumentative essay on the following topic:

Discuss the relevance of ‘geographical imaginations’ to our understanding of any aspects of human geography in Singapore.

Problematization occurs when it is shown:

that a prevailing idea, view, or situation needs reexamination, reconceptualisation, or reevaluation of some kind; in academic argumentation y [it] takes place in order to provide a ground for the more specific purpose, thesis, point or argument of an essay. (Barton, 1993, p. 748)

Two general patterns of problematization are actually identified in the data: firstly, contrastive positions on issues are presented to initiate the argument in the introductory paragraphs of essays; secondly, contrastive data or data which support conflicting positions (data taken from primary research as required by the task) are presented and discussed. In some instances, these contrastive data lead to a modification of the writer’s stand on an issue. This paper examines the use of engagement resources in the construal of the second type of problematization only, as the first type is sufficiently detailed to warrant another paper.

# 5. Results

# 5.1. Engagement resources

Table 1 presents the frequency of various engagement resources used in the high- and low-rated GEOG scripts. The average length of the high-rated essays was 2140 words while that for the low-rated essays was 1800 words. This analysis was validated through intrarater analysis which involved the researcher herself analyzing the data at two different points in time. The time interval of 2 months in this case allowed the researcher some opportunities for clarifying any bias in the analytical process (Cresswell, 1998) as she could reflect on her own subjectivity and how that would be monitored in the process.

To apply the $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test, the category of attribute:disclaim was combined with attribute:acknowledge as the former category formed a very small percentage making up an expected value of less than 5. The $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test shows a highly significant difference in the engagement resources used in the high- and low-rated GEOG scripts.

One of the major differences is in the frequency of bare assertion $( 3 0 . 6 \%$ and $4 7 . 1 \%$ in high- and low-rated scripts, respectively). There could be cases where issues that are debatable, issues that are central to the writing task assigned are expressed as bare assertion. As shown in Example 1a, some statements of hypothesis are expressed as bare assertions in some of the scripts.

$p = 1 . 4 3 5 0 1 \mathrm { E } { - 2 1 }$ $( \chi ^ { 2 }$ -test of relative frequency).

# Example 1a.

Television has helped to shrink the relative distance between people and countries. (LS45 1)2

Statements of bare assertion deny dialogic diversity potential in the proposition. In the larger study from which this paper is drawn, 85 and 50 statements of hypothesis were identified in the high- and low-rated scripts respectively. Seventeen $( 2 1 \% )$ of the 85 statements of hypothesis and 7 $( 1 4 \% )$ of the 50 hypotheses in the high- and low-rated scripts, respectively, are moderated in their expression of certainty. A moderated hypothesis is shown in Example 1b.

# Example 1b.

Therefore, a tourist landscape with an element of transportation will probably tend to have a stronger sense of globalisation than a similar landscape without any relation to transportation. (HS29 67)

This could indicate a stronger tendency for writers of high-rated script to moderate their hypotheses. Hypotheses are focal points in an argumentative text. The presence of hypotheses that are tentatively expressed, coupled with less assertive entertain options made (see later sections) in the high-rated scripts seem to indicate that high-rated script writers are inclined to be more tentative in general and at a more specific level to express their hypotheses allowing more negotiation space.

Categories which indicate a contractive dialogic disposition make up $2 6 . 7 \%$ and $2 0 . 7 \%$ of the high- and low-rated scripts, respectively. The most frequently used contractive category for the high-rated scripts is disclaim:counter while that for the low-rated scripts is proclaim:pronounce. The disclaim:counter and disclaim:deny options are also frequently used in the high-rated scripts to present contrasting data (see Section 5.2). On the other hand, the more frequent use of proclaim:pronounce in the low-rated scripts could indicate a stronger tendency to insist on the validity of one’s proposition, leaving little negotiation space for an alternative view.

After the option of disclaim:counter, the next biggest difference in the frequency of contractive options is found in the category of proclaim:endorse. The higher occurrence of proclaim:endorse in the high-rated scripts helps to highlight the effectiveness of supporting evidence provided. However, when seen from the dialogic perspective, it could also mean that writers of these scripts are more consistently tight in their allowance of negotiation space once evidence has been presented to support their points. Sentence (ii) in Example 2 illustrates one instance of a proclaim:endorse highlighting the significance of survey results reported.

# Example 2.

(i) The results of the survey are shown in Tables 2 and 3 below. (ii) $\# ^ { 3 } \mathrm { A s }$ we can see, the popularity of Woodlands new town between residents and non-residents is directly opposite to each other. (HS32 32, 34)

In both sets of scripts, the frequencies of proclaim:pronounce and proclaim:endorse are almost similar.

Categories which are dialogically expansive constitute $4 2 . 8 \%$ and $3 2 . 2 \%$ of the highand low-rated scripts, respectively, with the high-rated scripts showing more frequent occurrence of the attribute category and the weaker scripts the option of entertain. This could be accounted for by frequent references to survey results in the high-rated scripts to make a point. These results are quoted and attributed to the survey respondents so that valid data are provided to support points made as shown in Example 3.

# Example 3.

(i) City Hall Interchange was also widely perceived to be the busiest Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station.   
(ii) The percentage of respondents who chose City Hall Interchange followed closely behind that of Raffles Place Interchange, at $3 8 \%$ . (HS37 50-51)

The proposition in (i) is supported by evidence gathered from a survey conducted and attributed to the respondents.

As for the low-rated scripts, the category of entertain is frequently used for indicating dialogic space with a $3 . 8 \%$ difference between the high- and low-rated scripts. The category of entertain allows for adjustments in dialogic space through the use of modals or interpersonal metaphors. The low-rated script writers open dialogic space more frequently through the use of entertain option while the high-rated scripts do so through the attribute:acknowledge option.

The high frequency of attribute:acknowledge is partially accounted for by the consistent reference by writers of the high-rated scripts $( 2 6 . 7 \% )$ to such data for support. On the other hand, the low-rated scripts present half the frequency $( 1 2 . 3 \% )$ of attribute:acknowledge of that found in the high-rated scripts.

The significance of attributing supporting data to respondents in the stronger scripts can also be seen in terms of what Jordan (2000) calls the Assessment-Basis relation between clauses. With reference to Example 4, sentence (ii) provides the basis for the assessment made in sentence (i). As such, there is an implicit attitudinal appraisal of sentence (i) as appreciation: $^ +$ ve valuation.

In many instances, the significance of these data used as evidence in the high-rated scripts is often highlighted by the use of statements in the pronounce:endorse category. Thus, readers are persuaded into accepting the data and thus the corresponding assessments as valid:

# Example 4.

(i) An interview by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) concerning national identity revealed that $50 \%$ of those interviewed feel that they think of themselves more as citizens of the world than any particular country, up from $45 \%$ in 1993. (Straits Times, 19 February 2000, p. 58)   
(ii) This is testament to the effects of globalization. (HS33 16–17)

Here the endorsement of the evidence provided comes mainly from the word ‘‘testament’’ which in attitude terms is analyzed as appreciation: $+ \mathrm { v e }$ evaluation. This is because it evaluates the writer’s earlier proposition that people consider themselves ‘‘more as global citizens than as citizens of one particular country’’ as valid and thus a positive appraisal.

In some instances, the reinforcement is expressed in a more tentative manner as shown in Example 5. Here, the writer is substantiating the proposition that there is a lack of a strong Singaporean identity amongst Singaporeans.

# Example 5.

(i) #Of the 40 people interviewed, 22 people agreed or strongly agreed that Singapore did not have a sense of national identity (see Annex A, Q. 38) and cited the length of time since independence as being too short.   
(ii) Interestingly enough, three respondents below the age of 18 were unable to cite reasons for calling Singapore their home (see Annex A, Q.4) apart from the fact that they were taught to think so in schools.   
(iii) This perhaps suggests that national identity in Singapore may be a construction of political socialization, than a feature of reality. (HS33 9-13)

Sentences (i) and (ii) provide evidence from respondents of the survey conducted, supporting the writer’s point that there is a lack of Singaporean identity amongst her people. In sentence (ii), the use of engagement option disclaim:counter (‘‘interestingly enough’’) injects the writer’s evaluation of the significance of that piece of evidence. This significance is further elaborated in sentence (iii) which is expressed in a more tentative manner using the option of entertain. Essentially, the writer suggests a possible alternative to an implicit belief that there is a well-established sense of identity in Singaporeans. The writer suggests that that assumed sense of identity ‘‘may be a construction of political socialization, [rather] than a feature of reality.’’ Here, the reinforcement of the significance of the data provided is expressed in sentence (iii) in a rather tentative manner compared to options using pronounce:endorse. Though the use of pronounce:endorse helps reinforce the significant data, there were also other cases where compelling data were left to speak for itself.

# 5.2. Engaging contrastive data through problematization in the high-rated scripts

The significance of the engagement choices made in the scripts becomes clearer when one examines them in the context of textual development considerations and the rhetorical purposes intended in argumentative essays. The presentation of contrastive views to initiate an argument is one way by which problematization manifests itself in the highrated essays. This section discusses the presentation of conflicting data in the discussion of findings as a form of problematization.

Example 6 illustrates one such instance. Here, the issue is the extent to which the construction of regional centers (‘‘Tampines’’) has altered people’s perception of places such as city centers (‘‘downtown’’).

# Example 6.

(i) It could be seen that for this $6 8 \%$ of the respondents, Tampines was characteristically a location that provided for them all their basic needs.   
(ii) It can be seen from chart [11] that many people quoted accessibility and proximity to home, and even shopping as one of the ideal factors that drew them there.   
(iii) Accessibility is quite a key factor because it is evident that the regional centre was built on the basis of good infrastructure.   
(iv) In comparison, $32 \%$ of the respondents felt that the conventional downtown was still a major attraction, even though the regional centre had gained quite a vast amount of popularity and did to large extent have an air of modernity.   
(v) These respondents felt that clearly the greater variety and amounts of facilities were more appealing. (HS28 8–11)

Data are quoted in (i) to lead to the proposition that Tampines (the regional centre) has changed the respondents’ perception of places. Tampines, which provided for their basic needs, is accessible and is near home. Both sentences (i) and (ii) use the engagement resources of entertain to strengthen the use of data to substantiate a proposition. In sentence (iii), the writer makes a proposition on the importance of ‘‘accessibility’’ as ‘‘quite a key factor’’ in affecting the people’s perception of the place. Graduation resources ‘‘quite’’ and attitude resources ‘‘key’’ are used to show the writer’s opinion on the importance of accessibility in geographical imaginations. Having established his/her position on the importance of this factor, the writer brings in contradictory data in (iv) that partially disclaim the proposition he/she has just established through the use of ‘‘still’’ in the concessive structure. The clause prefaced by ‘‘even though’’ brings in the concession while the main clause disclaims that concession and insists on the point that there are people who ‘‘still’’ feel that the conventional downtown is a better place and that their perception is still negative despite the accessibility and proximity of regional centers. The writer then ends the argument on this issue by noting that this smaller number of respondents clearly prioritize other factors above accessibility and proximity. In terms of engagement, an attribution in sentence (v) has been used, and within the intertextual system, the reporting verb ‘‘felt’’ indicates attribute:disclaim. Thus, the author reports the respondents’ position without necessarily aligning himself/herself with it. What is important, however, is that a contradictory set of figures which does not support the writer’s position is acknowledged and presented. The contradictory data, however, do not represent a majority position (i.e., $32 \%$ versus $6 8 \%$ ) and thus the writer maintains his/her original position that regional centers have changed peoples’ perception of places around them.

In some cases, conflicting data are reasoned away carefully by the writer and the writer maintains his/her position on the issue discussed as seen in Example 7. The issue is that peoples’ geographical imagination of a place that has a local flavor is influenced more by the architecture than the atmosphere. Chinatown is one of those local places. This is because the geographical imagination is not formed by frequent visits to the place, which is more likely to be the case with tourist spots.

# Example 7.

(i) Majority of them $( 6 1 . 5 \% )$ felt that Chinatown shows that Singapore has retained its local flavor because of the conservation of its traditional shop-houses.   
(ii) Whereas there are some who felt that its atmosphere contributed to its local flavor.   
(iii) This is especially so during Chinese New Year, when the streets are filled with traditional decorative and people. (HS38 38–40)

In sentence (i), the data cited support the writer’s claim as it is the architecture that helps retain the respondents’ geographical imagination of the place. Sentence (ii) introduces contrastive data with the connector ‘‘whereas.’’ However, the conflict is explained in (iii) that it is mainly during festive seasons that people tend to be reminded of the atmosphere rather than the architecture of that place. Thus, the writer maintains his/her position on the claim although conflicting data have been presented.

What is also significant however is that in some instances, the presentation of conflicting data results in either a rejection or a qualification of a position taken to account for the conflicting data. This is seen in Example 8:

# Example 8.

(i) #In Wong’s study, another ‘‘geographical imagination’’ of Lucky Plaza is the view that it is a place where the Filipino maids get to know their ‘boyfriends’.   
(ii) To test this out, I decided to sit at KFC, a highly possible place for these ‘couples’ to chat,   
(iii) and it turned out that most Filipinos sat with their own female friends.   
(iv) Though there were several ‘couples’, these were definitely not the norm.   
(v) Hence the perception that Lucky Plaza is a place for maids to be ‘‘picked up’’ reveals not only a jaundiced view of Filipino maids, but also a convenient stereotyping that all the Filipinos at Lucky Plaza are maids. (HS40 30–38)

In sentence (i), the writer relegates the view that Lucky Plaza is a place where Filipinos gather to ‘‘get to know boyfriends’’ to an authoritative source. Contradictory results from field observation are presented in (iii). This problematizes the earlier proposition through the negator ‘‘not’’ and ‘‘definitely’’ which are options that denote a proclaim:pronounce that asserts the writer’s objection to that earlier view. Subsequently in sentences (iv) and (v) the writer reasserts through the disclaim:deny and disclaim:counter options that the view is ‘‘definitely not a norm’’ and ‘‘not only a jaundiced view’’ but also a ‘‘stereotype’’ that is unwarranted. Thus, the attitude elements such as ‘‘jaundiced’’ and ‘‘stereotype’’ help to convey the writer’s negative evaluation of the earlier view in (i). Essentially, the presentation of contradictory data results in a rejection of the original claim about the Filipinos.

In contrast to Example 8, the writer may qualify his/her claim as a result of contradictory data rather than rejecting it totally. In Example 9, the debate involves the view that tourist landscapes (e.g., hotels or sightseeing attractions) tend to evoke a higher sense of globalization than commercial landscapes (e.g., financial centers).

# Example 9.

(i) The most obvious difference here is that Raffles City is the only landscape among these top 4, which has no relation to transportation.   
(ii) #It might be drawn from this that transportation and related facilities greatly increase the sense of ‘‘globality’’ of a place. (HS29 54–56)

In this part of the discussion, the writer presents data that conflict because a tourist landscape (Raffles City) does not seem to rank well in terms of globalization when compared to three other tourist landscapes (e.g., Keppel Harbour). The writer then makes a tentative hypothesis in sentence (ii) using the option of entertain as indicated by ‘‘might.’’ The tentative position is a revision of the original view here as the element of transportation is seen as crucial in adding to the sense of globalization of a tourist landscape. Subsequently, in the original essay, the writer further substantiates this position by focussing on another tourist landscape, the World Trade Centre, a tourist landscape in Singapore. The sense of globalization of this tourist landscape is derived not because of the element of sea trade though it is named so but by the cruise industry that is based there; thereby proving the importance of transportation to the perception of globalization to that tourist landscape. The writer then concludes that:

Therefore, a tourist landscape with an element of transportation will probably tend to have a stronger sense of globalisation than a similar landscape without any relation to transportation. (HS29)

This is a refinement of his/her initial claim which states that:

[t]his research essay was started with the intention to prove the hypothesis that tourism landscapes in Singapore generally evoke a stronger sense of globalization than commercial or retail/entertainment landscapes. (HS29)

All these examples are taken from the high-rated scripts as the low-rated scripts show a lack of use of primary data and consequently, a much rarer occurrence of contrastive data. Mere descriptions of phenomena that do not present conflicting issues related to relevant geographical concepts seem to be less well accepted as good data. For example, markers’ comments such as this are taken from a script where the writer is clear in taking a position regarding the issue:

While this is potentially an interesting topic, your treatment of it is uncritical and somewhat simplistic. I am not convinced that watching TV about a particular place brings one closer to those places. More importantly, which places are covered y (LS45)

In this script, the writer clarifies his/her position from the start:

Television as a form of communication has helped to shrink the world in the relative sense, that is to say today, the relative distance between different countries around the has been shrunk. (LS46)

Also, the writer makes references to respondents’ world view gathered from a survey to substantiate his/her points. However, what is interesting here is that all the respondents’ views reported are those which support the writer’s idea that the television has helped shrink the world as shown in Example 10.

# Example 10.

#And when asked how useful is the role of television in shrinking the distance between us in Singapore and the people from other countries in the world on a scale of 1 to 5, 25 people interviewed gave a grade of 4 and 5. (LS45 15)

Throughout the essay, there is no attempt to problematize the position held by the writer. Essentially, all survey data support the writer’s assessment and at many points in the essay, the writer reinforces the relevance of his/her data as basis with these statements: ‘‘So as we can see, there is little doubt that y’’ and ‘‘the findings consolidated points to the fact that y

The marker comments that this is a simplistic approach to the issue and further on comments that there is ‘‘insufficient coverage of survey details.’’ Perhaps, what is expected is the treatment of the issue in a more realistic manner. For example, conflicts in data can be presented and discussed. It seems as if it is beyond the marker to believe that all data support the writer’s position. The marker comments that ‘‘the world may be shrinking but is it doing so in uneven ways’’ thus bringing up the point that some places in the world are more well represented on television than others. In effect, what the marker may mean by ‘‘insufficient coverage of data’’ is that there may be conflicting data or positions to what the writer is claiming and these should be brought in to develop a more sophisticated argument. In another script (S48), a similar kind of comment is made throughout the essay, the writer cites excerpts of interviews to support his/her position. The marker comments that ‘‘you seem to have carried out surveys in order to confirm your preexisting perception rather than as a means of testing a hypothesis.’’ Again, a possible implication could be that these are complex issues regarding peoples’ perception and as such, contrastive data leading to alternative positions may need to be discussed.

# 6. Discussion and conclusion

With reference to the research questions, the study reveals some patterns of differences in the use of engagement resources between the high- and low-rated scripts. Although these differences may not fully account for the grade differences, they may underline the importance of the appropriate use of such resources to the evaluative quality of arguments. The engagement system presents a gradation of dialogic space expressed by various options. This provides a good platform for the student and teacher to investigate the impact of different options of expressions on the rhetorical effect of the argument. Areas that can be highlighted are as follows.

The high-rated and low-rated scripts differ in the frequency of bare assertion. The lowrated scripts consist of a higher frequency of clauses that are stated as bare assertion. The high-rated script writers tend to indicate more instances of clauses with engagement resources generally and more specifically, their statements of hypothesis are more likely to be set in a dialogically expansive manner using the option of entertain. Allison (1995, p. 4) points out that one problem ESL writers face is that:

academic readers will consider claims that [student writers] put forward in their essays should be properly warranted and neither overstated nor understated in relation to evidence that the writers present or to assumptions that they might reasonably make about shared knowledge and values.

Students can be made more aware of crafting claims that neither overstated nor understated by exploring the various options in the system.

Among the dialogically contractive options, the high- and low-rated script writers use disclaim:counter and proclaim:pronounce most frequently, respectively. The importance of the frequency of disclaim:counter was seen in the way high-rated script writers use this engagement option in the inclusion of contradictory data to develop their points. The representation of negotiation in novice writing may not be done in an expert manner but the acknowledgement and countering of possible alternative views is a good stance to adopt. The representation of negotiation becomes especially authentic when writers modify their initial positions partially or fully in the light of contradictory evidence or ideas. Perhaps, Barton’s (1993) reminder on the privileged status of a contradictory stance in the American institution is useful as this particular stance may not be one which novice writers are most comfortable to adopt. The writing teacher may highlight the role of such a stance and demonstrate how when used in conjunction with other options that aligns the writer to authorized endorsement (proclaim:endorse), it actually reinforces the strength of the argument.

The low-rated scripts are less successful in the use of these patterns of writing. On the other hand, they use the contractive option of proclaim:pronounce more frequently resulting in a stronger tendency to insist on the validity of one’s proposition. If not well tempered, such scripts may conjure a sense of unwarranted assertiveness throughout the essay.

The high-rated scripts also consist of a higher percentage of another category of contractive options, proclaim:endorse. This option is frequently used in statements where the writer shows his/her alignment to a source voice, thus endorsing the proposition conveyed by the source which mostly supports the writer’s claim. The appropriate use of various textual sources to synthesize ideas is a skill that presents many difficulties to novice writers. On the other hand, tertiary level writing generally requires the competent display of such skills. Thus, another item in the writing syllabus should include the skillful handling of the mechanisms of intertextual discourse such as the use of appropriate reporting verbs which presents a challenge to student writers. Also, the use of appropriate attributions to create dialogic space, especially when citing survey results to substantiate one’s argument is another area that needs attention.

The effective use of engagement resources plays a central role in argumentation as even novice writers need to ensure that readers continue reading before persuasion can be effected. Successful texts require that negotiable moves between writer and reader are well anticipated and met. The array of choices available and the management of these options to achieve particular rhetorical effects is not something that is automatically acquired by all learner writers. Also, the broadening of interactive meaning beyond epistemic choices provides insights into the dialogic nature of texts. The present study though limited to a certain type of writing in a particular discipline represents one step forward in understanding what novice writers already know in terms of interpersonal literacy. This enables a more concrete idea of goals to work towards in developing this aspect academic discourse.
