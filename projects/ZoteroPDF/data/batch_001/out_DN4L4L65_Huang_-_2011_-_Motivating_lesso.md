# Abstract

This study investigated the impact of content-based language instruction (CBLI) on EFL young learners’ motivated behaviours, namely attention, engagement, and eager volunteering, and classroom verbal interaction. Situational factors play vital roles in shaping language learners’ motivation particularly in EFL contexts. While many private schools implement CBLI programmes in Taiwan as it has been proved elsewhere that such language programmes improve language learners’ motivation and academic performance in ESL contexts, such as US and Canada, the effects CBLI might have on EFL young learners have never been investigated in Taiwan.

Twenty-five six-year-old year one primary students participated in this study. Both classroom observation implementing Spada and Fro¨hlich’s [Spada, N., Fro¨hlich, M., 1995. COLT Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching Observation Scheme: Coding Conventions and Applications. Macquarie University, National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research, Sydney, Australia.] Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching (COLT) observation scheme and qualitative analysis of classroom video taping revealed that learners tend to participate more actively in subject-learning classes than language-input classes and have benefited from the programme in terms of eagerness to volunteer and classroom verbal output. Although the differences of the subjects’ attention level and engagement between content-focused lessons and language-focused lessons were not evident, there was a dramatic improvement in both types of lessons over six weeks.

# 1. Introduction

This current study endeavours to investigate whether Content-Based Language Instruction (CBLI) might have any impact on young EFL learners’ motivation and their verbal interaction in the classroom. The impetus of the present study was motivated by the growing population attending private institutions for better language instruction in Taiwan and by research indicating that language is more effectively learnt when the target language is in authentic use. CBLI has been widely implemented as an L2 instruction approach in North America and Europe since the 1980s, after the success of the innovative French immersion programme in Quebec, Canada, in 1965. CBLI usually refers to learning a second or foreign language through academic subject matter, such as Science, Maths, Art or Social Studies. It is an approach originally used for teaching learners with English as their second language (ESL learners) by combining language with disciplinary learning. The use of CBLI is aimed at building pupils’ grade-level content knowledge and developing their English proficiency at the same time.

It is not difficult to understand why so much effort has been dedicated to motivational research in the field of educational psychology and L2 learning as motivation is responsible for why students decide to carry out certain activities that enhance their learning, how much effort they are prepared to invest in order to carry out such activities, and how long they are willing to sustain these activities (Do¨rnyei, 2001).

The educational environment in Taiwan is dominated by a focus on academic success from primary school level. In order to have their children gaining a place in a ‘class for talented children’ and eventually to enter an elite university, parents usually have their children compete academically from the age of ten or eleven. About $8 5 \%$ of school children attend extra classes on academic subjects after normal school time (Huang, 2008). This competitive learning environment also stimulates demand for bilingual education. Nunan’s (2003) investigation found that the grade level in which English is introduced as a compulsory subject in schools has been shifted to a lower grade in the Asia-Pacific region, in countries such as China, Korea and Taiwan. While limited schooling time is available, combining content with language learning has provided a reasonable alternative for such a competitive environment in EFL contexts. Many private language sector institutions, such as private primary schools, junior high schools, and language centres in Taiwan, are implementing CBLI in their curriculums after observing the successful outcomes and benefits which CBLI has demonstrated in research conducted in ESL contexts, such as the United States and Canada.

However, very little relevant research has been conducted in EFL contexts for young learners. While many studies have been carried out on curriculum design particularly focusing on addressing learners’ needs (Brindley, 1989; Richards, 2001), Crookes and Schmidt (1991: 492) criticized the fact that a great deal of research has assumed that as long as a programme appears to “meet the student’s own expressed needs (or whatever their supervisors/ teachers believe to be their needs) [it] will be more motivating, more efficient, and thus more successful”. Supporters of the impact of curriculum designs on learners’ motivation rarely make explicit reference to motivational research.

# 1.1. Young EFL learners’ language-learning motivation

In recent decades, there has been a prominent shift from the focus on integrative motivation to situational factors in research into language-learning motivation. These studies have investigated what these factors are and how they might influence learners’ learning motivations as there is no argument that motivation “provides the primary impetus to initiate second or foreign language learning and later the driving force to sustain the long and often tedious learning process” (Guilloteaux and Do¨rnyei, 2008: 55e56). Apart from being socially (for integrative reasons), instrumentally or even cognitively motivated towards language learning, learners can also be motivated by classroom factors such as tasks, learning activities and instructional materials (Do¨rnyei, 1998; Ellis, 1985; Julkunen, 2001; Pinter, 2006). Cheng and Do¨rnyei (2007) further argued that language learners need to be motivated to a certain extent for their motivated behaviours to occur, and confirmed that teachers’ motivational practices are linked to learners’ motivated behaviours.

Situational factors are particularly imperative for young learners’ motivation in contexts where the target language, in this case English, is spoken as a foreign language, since young learners do not have direct contact with native speakers of the target-language culture nor do they have the urgency of getting a good job or entering higher education. Hence their attitudes and motivation towards target-language learning are mainly dominated by learning situations. More importantly, their motivations are mainly shaped by learning processes, such as how lessons are taught, whether the activities in class are interesting and meaningful to them, and whether the learners are feeling comfortable and not under unbearable pressure in the class. The above-mentioned factors play a vital role in shaping young learners’ motivations and attitudes toward English learning.

# 1.2. The role of teacher’s and learners’ classroom verbal interaction

The importance of learners’ output, both in speaking and writing, in the process of language acquisition has been greatly valued as it has three important functions, namely noticing/triggering, hypothesis testing and metalinguistic functions (Ellis et al., 2002; Izumi, 2002; MacIntyre et al., 2003; Swain, 1985; Swain and Lapkin, 2002). Empirical evidence has shown that, in producing the target language, language learners may notice their linguistic problems/ gaps which could trigger their attention to relevant input and lead them to establish a more durable memory trace (Izumi, 2002). Hypothesis testing means that learners could test or try out their hypotheses of how to say/write their intent. The metalinguistic (reflective) function refers to learners reflecting on language produced by themselves or others which mediates second-language learning.

# 1.3. Purpose of the study and research questions

The current study set out to examine how students’ motivated behaviours, namely the amount of attention the students pay in class, and the extent of their participation in and volunteering for tasks, differ in content-based English lessons from form-focused lessons, as well as how these two types of lesson shape teachers’ and learners’ verbal interaction in the classroom. CBLI is thought to have many benefits for learning languages for academic purposes. The rich context it provides, which scaffolds learning, generates learning interest and motivates learners, is thought to be the most encouraging (Brinton et al., 1989; Gibbons, 2003; Parkinson, 2000). However, none of these studies focused on young EFL learners’ observable motivated behaviours, nor did they have the explicit objective of providing empirical and qualitative data on the effectiveness of CBLI for enhancing teacher’s and learners’ verbal interaction in the classroom.

The research questions proposed were as follows:

1. Do learners’ motivated behaviours differ in CBLI lessons and language lessons? If so, how are they different? 2. Do teacher’s and learners’ verbal interaction in the classroom differ in CBLI lessons and language lessons? If so, how are they different?

# 2. Methods

# 2.1. Participants

The observed class in this study was from a private primary school located in Taichung in central Taiwan; it provides English-language courses for different purposes for learners aged from 6 to 12 and mainly targets intensive language courses using CBLI. It was one of the five classes in grade one in the summer 2007 programme. It consisted of twenty-five students, fourteen males and eleven females, who were aged from six to seven and came from middleclass families.

Most lessons were taught by two homeroom teachers (or form teachers) for this class. One is an English native speaker with a recognized ESL/EFL teaching certificate and the other is a Chinese and English bilingual with an ESL/ EFL teaching certificate. The English native speaking teacher in this class is a Canadian and has worked full-time in Taiwan as an English-language teacher in private bilingual primary schools for four years and is moving into her fifth year. The English native speaker was responsible for teaching all subjects to be taught in English, which included Reading, Science, Maths, Writing, CALL and library circle time. The English and Chinese bilingual homeroom teacher in this class is a Taiwanese native and has worked in this school for six years. Her responsibility mainly focuses on administrative affairs and she also teaches phonics and spelling classes.

# 2.2. The programme

Data collected in the current study were from a summer programme conducted in this primary school. The summer programme was developed by the school itself in order to help new students to bridge the change from kindergarten to forthcoming bilingual primary schooling by including both content-based subjects, such as Science, Maths and Social Studies, as well as form-focused lessons, such as reading, phonics, and writing.

# 2.3. Instruments

To obtain a valid and reliable picture of the learners’ motivated behaviours and their verbal interaction in CBLI lessons, an observation scheme was implemented for the current study by combining Spada and Fro¨hlich’s (1995)

classroom observation scheme (COLT) and Do¨rnyei’s (2001) system of motivational teaching practice. The adapted Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching (COLT) observation scheme comprises content categories relating to the communicative features of the learners’ and teachers’ verbal interaction in the classroom and the learners’ motivated behaviour. Only some categories in Part A of the original COLT scheme were used in the current research as the eliminated ones are irrelevant to the present study. Guilloteaux and Do¨rnyei (2008) have developed a classroom observation scheme, MOLT, by adapting the original COLT. However, MOLT as a whole was not implemented in the current study as it is designed to investigate how teachers’ motivational strategies influence students’ motivation. Hence the only category adopted from the MOLT scheme concerns learners’ motivated behaviours. The changes made are presented in Table 1: Category Differences between Original COLT and Adapted COLT. Category definitions of the adapted COLT scheme remained the same as in the original COLT.

The category of motivated behaviours manifested the amount of attention the subjects paid in class, and the extent of their engagement in and volunteering for tasks. In this study, ‘attention’, ‘engagement’ and ‘eager volunteering’ were defined in line with the criteria set by Guilloteaux and Do¨rnyei (2008). Thus ‘attention’ indicates that 2/3 of the subjects were observably paying attention, such as looking at the teacher or at another student who was contributing to the task, following the text being read, and looking at visual stimuli. ‘Engagement’ refers to 2/3 of the subjects actively and attentively taking part in classroom tasks or assigned activities. ‘Eager volunteering’ records that at least 1/3 of the class were volunteering, without the teacher coaxing them in any way, to take part in tasks, read the text in front of the class, or answer questions.

# 2.4. Procedure and data analysis

The four observations of the main study took place on two occasions, the second week (Week 2) and the last week (Week 6), during regularly scheduled 45-min content-subject or language-focused lessons of the summer programme. On the days of the observations, the author set up a camcorder and remained at the back of the class to take field notes. Although the Part A of the original COLT scheme was designed to be coded in a real-time situation, the adapted observation scheme used in the current study, both Part A and Part B, was carried out from the video tapes made during the observations as it was difficult to check back in a real-time situation.

Observation notes, by calculating tallies noted down in Part B of the adapted COLT scheme, provided a clear picture of communicative features (Spada and Fro¨hlich, 1995) in terms of proportions of the teacher’s and the learners’ speech types used during verbal interaction. Tallies noted down in Part A of the adapted COLT scheme illustrated what kind of language input was generated due to the different foci in language-input sessions and CBLI sessions. Tallies calculated from Part A and Part B of the observation notes were then computed to cross-examine how exactly communication features differed in language-input sessions and CBLI sessions by demonstrating ratio changes. Table 2 presents categorised examples for the teacher’s and learners’ speech during the recorded sessions and language-input sessions.

The main episodes of each class proceeding captured on the video tapes were transcribed, adopting the transcription conventions employed in Seedhouse (2004). Extracts of class proceeding episodes were then presented to provide an ethic view of the investigated lessons.

3.1. The qualitative view of the recorded sessions

# 3.1.1. Week 2 language-input session

The Week 2 language-input session was to introduce and practise language forms. The teacher started this episode by spelling words on the blackboard. The spelling activity followed a pattern of the teacher’s initiation with a spelling word, one selected learner responding, then the teacher’s feedback and finally finishing by the students writing the spelled words five times. As the activity was form-focused, the learners did not have opportunities to produce much of the target language in terms of structures and functions. In fact, only exchanges 10, 11 and 14 were natural speech and with communication purposes produced by the learners.

# 3.1.2. Week 2 CBLI session

This episode was part of the Week 2 science class which involved experimenting to discover whether black or white paper absorbs more heat. The session started with the teacher introducing the topic and describing the activity they were going to do. Then, with the whole class, the teacher went through the instructions provided in the textbook sentence by sentence. Finally, the class did the experiment together. Extract 2 shows exchanges between the teacher and the learners at the final stage of setting up the experiment and then a discussion episode. The teacher did not just appoint any learners to come up and help, instead she gave them a spelling task so that they could compete for the chance to help or to express their opinions. The teacher successfully built up a classroom atmosphere in which the learners felt that being able to ‘output’ and participate was honourable and rewarding. In this extract, all the subjects seemed to be very excited about the experiment to be carried out and wanted to help. In order to get picked as helpers, the subjects had to compete in the spelling game. Although similar games were played in the language-input sessions in both Week 2 and Week 6, the games did not appear to be as effective in terms of triggering the subjects’ eager volunteering. This teaching strategy to motivate learners to participate can be observed from the early stage of the experiment set-up and later in the episode (Appendix A Transcript 1).

Extract 2. Exchange 15e32 in Week 2 CBLI session e Science.

After setting up the experiment, the class then moved on to a discussion about what would happen to the water in the cups; this discussion is given in exchanges 33e47 (Appendix A e Transcript 1). Although all the questions were initiated by the teacher, the learners were allowed to express their views freely. Exchanges 34 (Emily: the sun will go drink the water.and no more water.), 36 (S8: Broken.), 37 (S9: bird come), and 39 (S9: A bird come) were responses by three different learners to the teacher’s initiation in exchange 33 (T: .Why? What do you think the sun is going to do to our water?) and 35 (T: Why the black and white paper? Why do you think that matters?). The teacher tried to narrow down the possibilities of what would happen to the cups in exchange 38, as learners S8, in exchange 36, and S9, in exchange 37, had started to become too imaginative. Despite getting the correct answer from one learner, Ken, in exchanges 41 (Ken: It give the sun .maybe will keep the sunshine.) and 43 (Ken: the black paper will take more (sunshine) in (than) the white.), the teacher did not comment on it. Instead, she left it until the end in order to arouse the subjects’ curiosity and to let them find out about it from the experiment result.

In this episode, the teacher used open-ended questions to elicit learners’ opinions on the experiment, such as why it was being carried out, and what sort of results they were likely to get. These questions all required learners’ cognitive processes. Rightly, the questions elicited learners’ responses.

# 3.1.3. Comparison: Week 2 language-input session vs. CBLI session

The patterns of the teacher’s and the learners’ verbal interaction differed in the Week 2 language-input session and CBLI session as a result of the different foci and nature of the sessions. The language-input session focused on language instruction or practice whereas the CBLI session involved both content knowledge and language practice. The most distinctive difference between these two sessions was that the teacher tended to allow the learners to express their opinions and this eventually enabled the learners to use the target language creatively. In contrast, due to the nature of the language-input session, both the teacher and the learners were constrained in a very formulaic interaction and focused only on language itself. This finding is consistent with data gathered by using observation tallies presented in Section 3.1: Quantitative Analysis.

# 3.1.4. Week 6 language-input session

The Week 6 language-input session was aimed at practising short vowel sounds. The session also included a reading activity and a song. The session transcript reveals that both the teacher and the learners produced very limited target language in terms of structure variety. Furthermore, it shows how the learners’ language output was restricted by the nature of the exercise. The teacher was the centre of the activity and was in total control. The learners did not have any opportunities to produce any complex linguistic forms as the context did not require any at all. Nevertheless it was totally acceptable as the aim for this activity was to practise short vowel detection.

# 3.1.5. Week 6 CBLI session

The recorded Week 6 CBLI session was a Maths class. Transcript 2 (in Appendix A) presents part of two episodes in this session which in total consisted of five episodes. The five episodes were vocabulary teaching, introduction of the topic, demonstration of measuring with paper clips, group practice and individual practice. The teacher was trying to teach the learners what measuring is and how to measure. The extract was taken from the episodes of vocabulary teaching and introduction of the topic.

The teacher started the session with vocabulary teaching. In exchanges 1e8, the teacher was trying to find out how much the class knew about the topic before the vocabulary teaching episode started. In exchange 9, the teacher realised that her learners knew very little about the topic and decided to start from other words associated with measuring. From exchanges 11 to 30, the teacher elicited from the learners key words and concepts associated with the topic of measuring. In this, she did some repairing by providing proper terms to describe a person’s weight and height. The teacher also demonstrated one very important academic skill, note taking, and summarised the concept of measuring and then put the summary on the blackboard in exchanges 32e43. While the students were taking notes, some learners started to make fun of others and of the teacher’s drawing (see Exchanges 46e55 in Transcript 2). The teacher did not intervene until exchange 56 as they were all engaged in authentic verbal communication related to the target teaching topic. The learners were allowed to continue ‘showing off’ from exchanges 57 to 67.

Transcript 2 reveals that the teacher sometimes needed to focus on linguistic forms in order to precede content teaching as the target language serves the function of content carrier. Nevertheless, it is sometimes difficult to draw a line of distinction between content and language teaching. In this extract, however, it was clear that some learners did not grasp the concept of measuring and could not measure (please see Exchanges 85e89 in Transcript 2) due to failing to comprehend the content.

# 3.1.6. Comparison: Week 6 language-input session vs. CBLI session

The teacher’s and the learners’ attention was directed towards language learning in the recorded Week 6 languageinput session, and towards content learning in the recorded CBLI session. The two presented episodes were very similar in terms of a) the teacher and the learners sharing more or less equal turns in their verbal interaction, and b) verbal interaction in both episodes being firmly controlled by the teacher.

The two episodes differed considerably in terms of the degree of cognitive challenge involved. Due to the nature of the CBLI session, the learners endeavoured to grasp the idea of measuring by using non-standard units in that particular session, paper clips, with the teacher’s help and hands-on activities. Such a session required the learners’ efforts to a) learn relevant vocabulary, and b) use skills of measuring. Therefore, the teacher’s and the learners’ verbal interactions were shaped around the topic and around getting each other’s meaning across. In contrast, the recorded language-input session was aimed at practising phonics, short vowel sounds. Consequently, the teacher’s and the learners’ verbal interactions were built around language only, without any content-knowledge involvement.

Resulting from the setting of the two recorded Week 6 sessions, the language structures used by the teacher and learners were poles apart in these two sessions. The learners tended to use more complex language structures and longer sentences in the Week 6 CBLI session whereas they did not produce any complex linguistic forms and mostly got their meanings across by using single word answers or questions in the other session because the context in that session did not require anything more than that.

# 3.2. Quantitative analysis: teacher’s and learners’ classroom verbal interaction

The teacher’s speech varied considerably according to both the nature (content-learning sessions and languageinput session) of each recorded session and the timing of the recordings, in Week 2 and Week 6. Fig. 1 presents the teacher’s verbal interaction during the four video-recorded sessions. The teacher’s minimal speech was slightly less in CBLI sessions than in language-input sessions in Week 2. This pattern remained the same in the Week 6 recordings (see Fig. 1: Teacher’s Speech). On the other hand, the teacher tended to use more sustained speech in CBLI sessions than in the language-input sessions during the same periods of time. Furthermore, the teacher tended to use more genuine questions, such as asking for the learners’ opinions on certain things, than pseudo questions in CBLI sessions. Pseudo questions, also known as display questions, are very common in language class settings.

Fig. 1 shows that the teacher gave, as well as requested, considerably more unpredicted information in CBLI sessions than in language-input sessions. Furthermore, the teacher reacted mainly towards meaning, and only minimal attention was paid to form in CBLI sessions. In addition, the teacher only gave predicted information in the languageinput sessions, and requested far more predicted information from the students in the language-input sessions than in the CBLI sessions. By comparing the percentages of Week 2 and Week 6 verbal interaction for each speech type, it can be concluded that there is a consistent pattern to the teacher’s language during the summer programme. The results show that the teacher used more authentic communication in CBLI sessions than in language-input sessions, which corresponds with the findings of research carried out by other researchers in the past. Similarly the patterns of learners’ speech showed that they tended to use more complete sentences in the Week 6 sessions than in the Week 2 sessions, and more complete sentences in CBLI sessions than in language-input sessions. Such a pattern reveals that the learners generated more complex speech in the CBLI sessions than in the language-input sessions. It also indicates that the learners produced more complex structures in Week 6 than in Week 2.

Fig. 2 illustrates the learners’ verbal interaction during the four recorded sessions. The learners reacted more to meaning and less to form in the CBLI sessions; it was the other way around in the language-input sessions in the Week

2 sessions. Such a contrast was sharper between the Week 6 content-learning and language-input sessions. Additionally, regardless of class type, unlike the teacher’s speech, students did not produce any predicted questions. On the contrary, the learners asked unpredicted questions which means that they only asked questions regarding the information they did not have.

The teacher’s speech influenced the learners’ responses noticeably. The frequencies of giving predicted information (shown in Fig. 2 as ‘3. Give predicted-info.’) were very close between the Week 2 CBLI sessions and language-input sessions. However, there was a large reduction between Week 2 and Week 6 sessions in general. Further, such type of speech was significantly less in Week 6 CBLI sessions than in the language-input sessions. Such contrasts directly corresponded to the teacher’s verbal interaction pattern shown in Fig. 1. The learners gave predicted information resulting from the teacher’s request by using pseudo questions. Likewise, the learners provided more unpredicted information, such as expressing their opinions, when the teacher allowed them to by requesting unpredicted information. Such influences show that even in CBLI sessions the teacher was in control of the verbal interaction in the classroom.

To sum up, the pattern shows that the students produced more sustained speech and gave more unpredicted information and reacted to meaning more frequently in the CBLI sessions. On the other hand, the students used much more minimal speech, gave more predicted information and reacted more frequently to form in the language-input sessions.

The recorded sessions demonstrated how the verbal interaction in the classroom diverged radically across time and the foci of the lessons. Fig. 3 demonstrates the ratio changes of the teacher’s and the learners’ total turn-taking in each recorded session. The teacher and learners shared more or less the same turns in terms of verbal interaction. However, there is a difference between the language-input sessions and the CBLI sessions. The learners contributed more in terms of speech frequency in both CBLI sessions. Furthermore, the learners produced more complex language structures in the CBLI sessions.

Nonetheless, the teacher dominated the overall verbal interaction in the classroom in both the language-input sessions and the CBLI sessions. This is evident from the ratio of the teacher’s and the learners’ initiations during the classroom activities. Fig. 4 presents the teacher’s and the learners’ initiations by the use of questions in the recorded sessions. The teacher’s use of questions accounted for more than $90 \%$ of initiations during the Week 2 language-input session and CBLI session, in which the learners initiated a little more in the CBLI session than in the language-input session. By the end of the programme, at Week 6, the initiations were still mostly dominated by the teacher. However, there was a big difference between the learners’ initiations in the recorded Week 6 sessions. The learners accounted for significantly more initiations in the subject-learning $( 2 1 \% )$ session than in the language-input session $( 7 \% )$ .

# 3.3. The learners’ motivated behaviours

The results show that although the students improved their motivated behaviours in class, there were differences between the language-input sessions and the CBLI sessions in terms of the subjects’ attention and engagement in both Week 2 and Week 6. In general the learners’ motivated behaviours improved considerably over the six weeks of this summer programme. As Fig. 5 shows, the subjects demonstrated motivated behaviours for $63 \%$ of class time in the language-input session and $64 \%$ of class time in the CBLI session in Week 2. By Week 6, they showed motivated behaviours in $86 \%$ of class time in the language session and $81 \%$ of class time in the CBLI session.

In Week 2, although there was a percentage difference between the two types of lesson, the actual amount of time for more than 2/3 of the class paying attention to the teacher in both language session $( 2 3 \% )$ and CBLI session $( 2 5 \% )$ held steady as the $2 \%$ difference only translates into about one minute of the regular $4 5 \mathrm { - m i n }$ class time. As in Week 2, although there was an increased amount of time, with more than 2/3 of the class paying attention in Week 6 in both types of lesson, no dramatic difference between the language-input session, $30 \%$ , and the CBLI session, $31 \%$ , was evident.

The trend of the learners’ higher levels of motivated behaviours and engagement revealed a very similar pattern to their attention being paid in recorded lessons. The subjects appeared to participate actively in assigned activities for more or less the same amount of time in both types of lesson, $40 \%$ in the language session and $39 \%$ in the CBLI session, in Week 2. Then their engagement improved to $56 \%$ in the language session and $50 \%$ in the CBLI session in Week 6.

Fig. 5. Learners’ motivated behaviours: attention & engagement.

The learners appeared to volunteer more eagerly in the CBLI sessions than in the language sessions regardless of the timing of the classroom recording. Fig. 6 presents the subjects’ motivated behaviours on eager volunteering in the recorded sessions. As noted in the Methods section, eager volunteering refers to more than 1/3 of the students raising their hands to answer the teacher’s questions, or volunteering to help with setting up activities, or demonstrating something upon the teacher’s requests. The results show that for all the questions/requests proposed by the teacher, $11 \%$ of them in the Week 2 language session were eagerly volunteered for or responded to, whereas $36 \%$ of the teacher’s questions/requests were eagerly volunteered for in the CBLI session during Week 2 recordings. This type of motivated behaviour, unlike attention and engagement, however, observed a sharp fall in Week 6 recordings in both types of lessons: just $3 \%$ in the language session and $16 \%$ in the CBLI session.

Although a remarkable discrepancy between language-input sessions and CBLI sessions was evident, the author hesitates to conclude that such a significant difference was purely due to the content element involved in the CBLI sessions. The phenomenon of eager volunteering could be triggered by many factors, such as class/lesson atmosphere, reward or the difficulty of the teacher’s questions/tasks, activity settings (whether they involve individual or group competition) and learners’ willingness to communicate/participate (MacIntyre et al., 1998; MacIntyre, 2007; MacIntyre and Doucette, 2010). Nevertheless, there is a great possibility that the behaviour of eager volunteering could have been initiated by the teacher rewarding the opportunities to be the helpers to set up experiments in the current study.

# 4. Conclusions

To answer the first research question, differences in the learners’ motivated behaviours, attention and engagement appeared to be marginal between two investigated class types except for their eagerness to volunteer. The subjects volunteered more eagerly in both recorded content-learning sessions.

In response to the second research question proposed in the current study, the learners had a tendency to use more complex and longer sentences in both the Week 2 and Week 6 CBLI sessions compared with the Week 2 and Week 6 language-input sessions. Such big differences observed in the recorded sessions, namely more active learner participation, more complex use of the target language and more cognitive learning involved in the CBLI sessions, indicate that in the use of content elements a language classroom generated more active verbal interaction from the learners in terms of quality and quantity.

The findings described above could have some implications for teachers’ development. By shifting the focus in an English-language classroom, namely from form-focused to meaning-focused, the teacher could easily create for the learners more opportunities for negotiating meanings and could encourage more dialogical verbal interaction in a language classroom. Numerous studies have shown that teachers’ awareness of their classroom language use can be effectively raised by watching their own performance from video tapes/classroom transcripts. The classroom recordings and particular findings in this study can be used to raise the teacher’s awareness of her classroom language use. This can be done just by simply showing the recordings or the transcripts to the teacher involved.

42. T $=$ Great! the water will keep the sunshine   
43. Ken $=$ the black paper will take more in the white   
44. T will take more in the white? Oh::but how do we know it’s true? If black takes more than the white. Then what will be true with the water?   
45. S10 Gone!   
46. S11 The water will be hot.   
47. T ah ha (0.5)the water will be hotter. If the black paper takes more sun. Then the water in the black cup will be warm, right? now:: these both are the same temperature. They feel the same. $=$ You guys wanna feel it?   
48. Ss Yes!   
49. yes? Ok. You need to line up.(Ss lining up in front of the class). right in front of this desk. (1.0) Yeason., you can put both of your fingers in the cups. Is it the same temperature?
