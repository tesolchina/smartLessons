Formulaic sequences (e.g., on the other hand, for example, as can be seen) are prevalent in academic discourse. Apart from their various functions, research in the field has uncovered a range of contextual and individual factors associated with the use of formulaic sequences, including genre, discipline, and the user's L1 as well as expertise level. However, most previous studies focus on written discourse and employ a frequency-based approach (e.g., lexical bundles, n-grams). The inherent limitations of the approach are of particular relevance to ELF communication, which involves a high degree of flexibility adaptability. The present study aims to explore features of formulaicity in spoken ELF academic discourse. Through a close examination of the phraseological patterns of one verb sAy in a one-million-word corpus of spoken ELF communication in academic settings, the present study is able to overcome some of the limitations of the frequency approach, thereby shedding further light on formulaicity in language use characterising this particular community and its relationship with factors such as event type, discipline, and individual preference.

# 1. Introduction

Formulaic sequences (FSs), i., fixed or semi-fixed word combinations that have \*an especiall strong relationship with each other in creating their meaning" (Wray, 2008, p. 9), present a major hurdl for L2 learners to achieve nativelike fluency (Pawley & Syder, 1983; Sinclair, 1991; Wray 2008, 2012). Unlike 1 speakers, for whom those prefabricated' sequences are stored and retrieved from memory as whole entities at the time of use in accordance with the idiom principle (Sinclair, 1991), L2 speakers are said to rely primarily on analytical processing (Wray, 2002) (or the open-choice principle in Sinclair's (1991) terminology), building sentences from individual words and grammatical rules which sometimes results in grammatically correct but non-idiomatic language use. This view has been called into question in studies of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), which have provided further insights into the working of these two mechanisms in L2 speakers, taking into consideration social and cultural circumstances specific to ELF communication (e. , House, 2009; Mauranen, 2012; Metsa-Ketela, 2012; Vetchinnikova, 2015). However, most studies focus on uninterrupted inguistic forms, either fixed combinations such as you know (House, 2009), and so on (Metsa-Ketela, 2012) or frequently occurring lexical bundles such as it is important to, one of the (Mauranen, 2012; Wang, 2017), whereas sequences that allow a certain degree of formal ariailit (e.g., Iwould/should/willsay, as we ofte say) have rceived les atention. As shown in Wang (2018a, 2020), such sequences make up a considerable proportion of FSs produced in ELF setings, revealing important features of formulaicity that callfor further

and more systematic study.

Over the last decade, corpus studies have revealed that FSs are particularly prevalent in academic discourse, providing an important means for, among other things, discourse building (e.g., on the othr hand, as a result, as can be sen) and stance taking (e., we argue that, to some extent) (Biber et al., 2004; Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008a). Apart fromtheir main functions, reerch in the field has also uncovered a range of contextual and individual factors tied up with the use of FSs, including genre e.g., Wang, 2017; Biber et al., 2004), discipline (., Durrant, 2017; Hyland, 208a), and the language user's 1 as w as expertise level ., Hyland, 2008b, Adel & Erman, 2012). Most of these studies are based on written academic discourse, but it remains to be seen f and how these factors work together to inform the choice and use of FSs in spoken academic discourse.

The present study takes a step further in the exploration of formulaicity in language use characterising academic ELF communication by focusing on one verb say in a large corpus, which allows a systematic investigation of the forms and functions of word combinations involving say and their relationship with certain contextual and individual variables.

# 2. Formulaic language use in academic ELF communication

A range of contextual factors have been observed to be associated with the use f FSs in academic EL communication. Metsa-Ketela (2012), for instance, fins that vague expressions e., nd so on, so to say, in  way) are more commonly used in dilogic spech events such as doctoral defences and seminar discussions than in monologic speech events, and more commonly used in some disciplines such as technology than in humanities and social sciences. The efect f genre (or speech event type) and discipline are also evident i the use of four-word lexical bunde .g., I would ike to, I dont know i) (Wang, 2017). I particular, the ltter variable has atracted a great deal of atention in written academic discourse. Using a lexical bundles approach, corpus studies (e.g., Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008a, 2008b; Durrant, 2017) have yielded strong evidence that FSs play an important role in identfying membership of acommunity that shares the same domain of knowledge. Investigations of the effect of this factor on speech have lagged behind, partly due to the hypothesis that bein fundamently different from academic writing, disclinary difference may be les relevant in acadmic speech (Adel, 2008). However, there is some evidence that disciplines also matter i academic speech (e.g., Wang, 2017; Kashiha & Heng, 2014).

Apart from genre and discipline, inter-speaker variation has been observed as regards individual preferences for particular FSs, associated wth a seakers individual and socil idntt, L1, cre, and prsonality trats such as extroversion ., Gablasova t al. 2017; Metsa-Ketela, 2012; Pitzl, 2012). Gablasova et al. (2017) for instance, examine epistemic stance markers (e.g., I'm certain in speech of 132 advanced L2 peakers from different 1 backgrounds in four speaking tass and find that while the peakers are capable of choosing the most suitable marker according to the speaking task, they alsoretain their more individual preferences for particular markers' (p. 626).

One feature of formulaicity in ELF communication that has been well established is, according to Mauranen (2009, 2012), approximation of onventional forms, meaning that there is oten considerable variabilit (or creativity) in linguisi forms employed by ELF speakers. As summarised in Pitl (2012), the creativity may take the form of lexical ubstitution (e.g., I'm not very sure instead of I'm not quite sure), syntactic and morhosyntactic variation (eg, carved in stones instead of caved in stone, in the ight rack instead of on the right track), or internal modification through the insertion of additional elements (e.g., two different sides of the same coin). Vetchinnikova (2015) brings to light an additional proces, namely fixing, through which the core collocates of related entities fuse together, for instnce, th xs rech and sirch  her dase  be drived from the coreolocats wth thre andthe idea of closing existing gap in academic discourse. Despite a certain degree of variability in the surface structure, a holistic unit of meaning or function is stil retained, sugesting that the diom principle is in operation after ll Inded, as observed in the above studies, formal variations do not sem to disrupt ELF interaction, wherein linguistic creativity is not ncessarily a matter of deficiency but rather a conscious choice made to facilitate communication with interactants who have little in common culturally and socio-linguisticlly. In other words, without shared conventions or formulaic ways of expressing ideas, speakers may intentionally resort to forms that are semanticlly transparent and syntacticall regular (Keckes, 2019). In addition, the creation ofnew forms and expressions may alo grow out of aneed for non-conformity and self-expression, a way to show one's identity (Pitl, 2012). To put it briefl, these studies show great potential for examining formal variations in formulaic language used by ELF speakers in connection with the two processing mechanisms (analytica vs. holistic) and the relationship between them and relevant contextual factors. The present study takes a step further in that direction through a systematic investigation of al forms of variation assciated with one particular word.

As can be seen above, most of the previous studies either focus on a predetermined list of FSs with fixed forms (mostly idioms and metaphors) and a particular function, or rely on the computer to identify chunks of language on the basis of the recurrence of uninterrupted linguistic forms. The ltter type of research is probably more helpful in providing an overallpicture of fomulaicity than does the former. However, the inherent limitations of the methodology mean that a great deal may have been overlooked (Adel & Erman, 2012; Pan et l., 2020). One limittion is related to dispersion- that is, how bundes are distributed acros the whole dataset It is measured by the number ftt files in which aertain word combination occurs, readesf how fte i ccurs i each file as ong as it reaches the dispersion threshold. However, the high frequency of a given combination could till e skewed by a small number of individuals who, for whatever reason, may havea particular preference for thecombination. It can beeven more problematic when we deal with poken corpora where one file can contain multiple speakers. Without tking into account inter-speaker variation in each file, the reliability of previous conclusions on genre and disciplinary differences could be challenged.

Another limitation of the frequency-based approach lies in the dificulty in handling discontinuous and infrequent sequences. The limitation may be particularly relevant to studies dealing with poken language, where formulaic word strigs can be interrupted by hesitations, repetitions, false starts, and the like (Wang, 2018a, 2020). The problem is further compounded in studies of ELF communication, which is characterised by a high degree of flexibility and adaptabilit, meaning that the language use is constantly adapted by is users according to the context (Seidhofer, 2011). Formal variations of otherwise formulaic language may escape automatic identification as each variant form may not occur frequently enough to reach the frequency threshold to be included. However, taken together, these forms can reveal important patterns that are crucial in understanding features of formulaicity specific to a given community (Wang, 2018b).

This one-word study is designed specificlly to address the limitations of the frequency-based approach in formulaic language research. Focusing on one particular word and its phraseological paterns makes it possble to take into account all possible formal variations, which in turn wil llow us to revisit certain issues such as the two processing mechanisms (analyti vs. holistic) in L2 language use as well as the relationship betwen formulaic anguage use in spoken academic dscourse and extrlinguistic factors such as event type, discipline, and speaker variation.

The word sAy emerges from Wang (2020), which is based on a fairly smalldataset, as a good candidate for a more systematic investigation, give its high frequency and verstilit. Inters of vertilit, a hinato (2004) otes, spech act vers such as s are productively used in a range of constructions (eg.,I say, say, I dare say, as you say, that i to say). In many constructions, the actional meaning of the verb is backgrounded, serving primaril pragmatic functions such as expressig tentativenessor surpris, introducing a condition or an example, and attracting atention (Brinton, 2008). However, pragmatic markers of verbal origins have received much less atention than those of adverbial origin e.g, actually inthe reearch literature of the English language in general (Van Olmen, 2013) let alone in ELF contexts. While some of the constructions are quite fixed and allow lite internal variation such as thatis to say, others seem formall flexible, involving a number of variable slots including the subject, the form of the verb, the adition of modal verbs and other modifiers. As Swales (2019) suggests, syntactic features such as tense choices may also be an integral part of phraseological patterns and uses, and therefore deserve more attention than they have hitherto received in formulaic language research. While those semantically transparent and syntacticall regular expressions may appear to be subject to the open-choice principle, as Vetchinnkova (2015) suggests, they can display hidden' formulaic features shared by members of a given discourse community. Through examining the usage patterns of the verb sar extracte from a one-million-word corpus, the present study keeps digging for what may be hidden' from the conventional frequency-based approach. In particular, the following research questions will be addressed.

RQ1. What forms are used and what functions do they have? RQ2. How are these forms and functions distributed among event types, disciplines, and individual speakers?

# 3. Data and methods

The present study employed the whole ELFA corpus (Mauranen, 2008), which contains one million words of naturally-occurring spoken academic ELF, transcribed from approximately 131 hours of speech events, both monologic ones $( 3 3 \% )$ , such as lectures and presentations, and dialogic events $( 6 7 \% )$ , such as seminars, thesis defences, and conference discussions, recorded in universities based in Finland. The corpus covers a number of disciplinary domains including social sciences $( 2 9 \% )$ , technology $( 1 9 \% )$ , humanities $( 1 7 \% )$ natural sciences $( 1 3 \% )$ , and medicine $( 1 0 \% )$ . The data were produced by approximately 650 speakers from 51 different L1 backgrounds (see Mauranen et al., 2010 for more information about the corpus).

AntConc (Anthony, 2020) was used to search for all forms of the verb sa (say, says, saying, said). The concordance lines were examined to retrieve mult-word sequences that form complete semantic units (Buerki, 2016). lthough sar as a single-word unit is also interesting (ee, ., Brinon, 208; Van lmen, 2013), it fll utide the scope of the preent study. Therfore, instances such as 1) were excluded from the subsequent analysis.

(1) can we can we well think of say a country in which or countries in which this proces is is happening .. (USsEMD280)

In some cases, the search word may be repeated or corrected immediately as in (2) and (3). I (2), the word form say occurs twice in the question, but was only counted once in the study. In(3), although say was uttered, it was corrected immediately. As the intended expression was as he writes, such instances were not considered.

(2) er can you say s-er perhaps say something (CDIs08B)   
(3) and as he say-er writes on page ten where communication technologies provide a public and social space for the constant process on national imagination ... (UDEFD070)   
Instances where say is used as a noun, as in (4), were also excluded.   
(4) ... because i know that the rotumans don't have much say in the fiji daily politics. (CDIs08A)

The remaining intances were then coded for formal, functional, contextual (event type, discipline), and speaker information. Formal variables include subject, modal verb, modifier, and tense. A functional taxonomy was developed on the basis of dictionary definitions and existing literature such as Brinton (2008), which focuses on comment clauses involving say, and Halliday's (2014) metafunctional systems (se also Wang, 2018a,b). The taxonomy, presented in Table 1, covers the main functions of sA-expressions identified in the present study.

The functions can be roughly divided into three broad categories. The first category (actional)i associated with the core meaning of the communication verb sAr. Expressions of this category are ofen followed by what isaid/written. The other two categories (discoursal and interpersonal) represent pragmatic use of sr-expressons. The illr function is not covered in the literature about sAYexpressions, but was aded in the present study. It was assigned when a given sAr-expression seems to be dangling outside a proposition; it does not contribute to the meaning of the proposition, and is used to fil th void when the peaker is looking for words or organizing mentall incoming thoughts and ideas. Such expressions are often accompanied by repetitions or hesitation markers.

The concordance line, and sometimes even larger context, was consulted when deciding the function of a given expression, which can have iferent functions in different context cf. Section 4.3) Some expressions can have multiple functions in the same context particularly I would say, I have to say, where the choice of modal verb alone expresses a kind of atitude (would to expressa certain degree of uncertainty; have to to add emphasis. When they are used to introduce an answer or to interrupt, they can be considered as having at least two functions: attitude marker (expressing opinion) and turn-taking device (interactional). In order not to inflate the numbers, each expression was assined only one function. In cases where i is possible for an expression o have more than one function of the same broad category, the aditional function was prioritised over the inherent one. Thus, when expressions such as I would say and I have to say are used to elicit an answer or a turn, as in (5), they were treated as interactional devices.

(5) ${ < } \mathbf { S } 2 { > }$ ... how do you know that the extractions you made are adequate ${ < } / { \cal S } 2 >$ ${ \bf \zeta } { \bf < } { \bf 1 > }$ well i have to say that er er without the modelling of the data values it's not entirely appropriate yet er... ${ < } / { \bf S 1 > }$ (UDEFD060)

In cases where there are competing interpretations involving functions belonging to diffrent broad categories, the expression was put under an additional category (Indeterminate). What follows is an example of this kind.

(6) and ithought this gentleman from india was er loking very obscure and so on you know about that information and so on and @i was like (anyway) $@$ and and you know i don't know i don't have anything to say but i'm just very excited that i would have almost missed this presentation going through could be so obscure and $( x x )$ and actually it is first-class (critique) (CDIS08B)

In (6), the expression I don't have anything to say could mean that the speaker is not sure or willing to make any comment on the issue, in which sense it would be regarded as expressing opinion (interpersonal). Another possible interprettion is that his expression is simply a iller (dicoursal) tother with the reetition (nd and) and heition markers (you know, I dont know) it flls a pause the ongoing turn for the speaker to retain the floor while thinking about what to say next.

# 4. Results and discussion

In this section, the main results will be presented first in terms of the overall distribution of sr-expressions across event types, disciplines, and individual speakers (4.1), and their main forms and functions (4.2). Section 4.3 then discusses some interesting features that have emerged from the results in more detail.

# 4.1. Overall distribution of sAy-expressions

Altogether, 3539 sr-expressions were identified in 153 (out of 161) files, produced by 413 diffrent speakers. Fig. 1 shows the distribution and density of sAr-expressions acrosindividual speakers (median (4.0) marked by the vertical line, and the mean (8.57) marked by the red circle; outliers marked by smaller black dots $\mathrm { ( S D = 1 3 . 5 1 7 ) }$

The majority of speakers (279 out of 413, $6 8 \%$ produced one to six sAy-expressions each, while 44 $( 1 1 \% )$ speakers contributed between 20 and 52 instances each. As can be seen in Fig. 1, four points lie far from the rest, representing two speakers from Inter national Relations with 83 instances each, one from Information Technology (86) and one from Philosophy (139).

Fig. 2 displays the distribution of sar-expressions across event types, grouped into two broad categories (dialogic vs. monologic).   
Given the communicatie natur of the word, it i not surprising to see sa-expressions occurring morefrequently in dialogic events   
that involve discussions (3.65 per 1000 words than in monologic events such as lectures and presentations (2.56 per 1000 words). The   
difference between dialogic and monologic events is statistically significant: Log-likelihood $= 8 9 . 7 2$ $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; odds ratio $= 1 . 4 3$ Fig. 3 presents the distribution of sar-expressions across isciplines. Apart from engineering and medicine disciplines, most of   
which appear to cluster at the two ends of the continuum, it is diffcult to draw any conclusion about disciplines belonging to the   
domains of social sciences and humanities as they are scattered along the whole continuum. Taking event types into consideration, the   
data of the top five disciplines are dominated by dialogic events such as conferences and doctoral defense discussions and the bottom

five by monologic events such as lectures and seminar presentations, suggesting that the distribution is more likely to be afected by event types than discilines. It should alo e mentioned that the contribution from the top four outliers as seen in Fig. 1 does not make the disciplines to which they belong (Philosophy, International Relations, Information Technology) stand out in comparison and therefore the distribution is unlikely to be skewed much by individual differences, either.

# 4.2. Forms and functions

Table 2 presents the counts (in terms of both tokens and types) of sy-expressions involving different forms of the verb. As can be seen, the say-expressions identified from the dataset are dominated by two forms: say and said.

Table 3 ists the most common usage patterns for each form. Apart from let's say and so to say, which can be regarded as fixed expressions in terms of their formal invariaility, all the others seem to be semantically and syntactically regular expressions.

It is alsolr fromable 3 tha ffent foms rer diffe uag patts, which in rn are associte wth diffe utions. The form say is predominantly used with modal or semi-modal verbs (would, can, must, might, could, have to) and first- and second. person pronouns $\left( I , \right.$ we, you) to express an opinion or to start a turn in a conversation. Said is used primarily as a past tense form, and often co-occurs with the conjunction as in the pattern as somebody said to refer to what has been said previously. The form says is used predominantly with he or it or a personal name to introduce a quote or (in)direct peech. The -ing form of say is mostly used in association with the progressive aspect as a way to elaborate further on a point just made.

Fig. 4 presents the distribution of functions according to the three broad categories across dialogic and monologic event types. Log-likelihood tests of the difference between dialogic and monologic event types within each function type have been conducted. All tests show a statistclly significant difference, but with a small to medium effect size (apart from indeterminate): Discoursal olikelihood $= 1 7 . 6 9$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; odds ratio $= 1 . 2 8$ Interpersonal: Log-likelihood $= 3 9 . 0 3 $ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; odds ratio $= 1 . 5 5$ Actional: Loglikelihood $= 1 3 . 1 3$ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ; odds ratio $= 1 . 2 9$ Indeterminate: Log-likelihood $= 8 9 . 4 5$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; odds ratio $= 3 2 . 5 9 $

Fig. 5 provides more information about the breakdown of the main categories into those subcategories as listed in Table 1.

As shown in Fig. 5, sAy-expressions are predominantly used with pragmatic functions $( 6 9 \% )$ : organizing discourse, expressing opinions, or acting as interactional devices. This finding is consistent with the general trend that Goossens (1982) observes, namely that the communication verb sar often takes on various pragmatic functions, ranging from textual to interpersonal, while the actional

Brinton (2008) provides an overview of the pragmatic functions of say in present-day English, focusing on a number of constructions/categories: I say, let's say, I daresay, s) you say, and that i to say. In what follows, the main functions emerging from the present study are presented in comparison with Brinton's categories.

Among the pragmatic uses of sAr-expressions found in the ELFA corpus, the most common one may be regarded as belonging to the category of (s) you say as icussed in Brinton (2008), use to remind the hearer(s) of what someone has said on a previous occasion to either take isue with the information or to confirm understanding or interpretation A number of formulaic sequences are asociated with this function, particulrly s Isaid and you say (that). ach has various forms, for the former, the conjuction slot can be filled with either as or like, and the subject slot I can be replaced by other pronouns or personal names e.g, as  said (that), as you said, lik I sid, like you sid; oasionally the verb can also occur in the preent tense .g., as you say, like you say. Intervening or additional elements, typically in the form of time or place adverbials, were also found, e.g. as sb said here/in the last session, as I said earlier/here/at the beginning. he high frequency f thi function is clrly atriutable to the aadmic setings in question. ome xpresions are typically used in academic letures and preenttions (., s sad erlier/hee/t the benning), and some in dicussions (.g., ike/s yo sid.

The expression I dare say was not found in the present study. However, is function, i.e., expressing speaker tentativeness of the truth value of the matrix clause, typically glossed as I suppose, asume, presume, tuned out to be the second most common function of the pragmatic uses of sA-expressions in the ELFA corpus. Brinton (2008) mentions some variant forms of I dare say such as I must say, you might say, which were also found in the present study. But the more frequently use forms are I would sa that), ollowed by we can (also/of course/really say (that). The other, les common formal variants incude we could say (that), you could say (that), you might say (that), I will say (that), one could (also) say (that).

Let's say is the most frequent sy-expression in the data, but is main function, which has the sense of for example, acording to dictionaries and the iterature (e.g., Brinton, 2008; Van Olmen, 2013), accounts for about one fourth of the occurrences. Multiple functions were found in the remaining instances (cf. Section 4.3).

I say occurs sporadically in the data, and was not used with its main pragmatic function as discussed in Brinton (2008), namely atracting attention or expresing surprise It wasused in the ELFA corpus with its primary meaning, often followed by direct spech, arising from the need of narrating an event, as in the following example.

(7) and then recently i met him and i say so now what do you think and he says listen he says i i've not changed my mind radically (CPRE06C)

Other expressions which have the same function but occur more frequently include he said (that), he says (that) they said (tht), hey say,  said (that),  says that), I sid, with he and they dominating the pronoun slot, and the tense choice varying between the simple present and the simple past. In fact, this is the most common function associated with sAr-expressions in the present study. gain, this may be a feature of academic discourse in general, of which citation practices constitute an essential part. The frequency of this function i particularly high in one pecific event type, namely thesis defense discussion, where there is a need to constantly refer to what is said/written in the thesis under discussion.

That is o say, which is atextual device ften employed in written academic discourse,occurs only a handful of times in the spoken data under investigation. The function of elaborating on what has just been said is more often fulflled by let's say. Another set of expressions involve the pattern $I +$ progressive say: I'm (not) saying (that), what I'm saying (here) is (that).

Functions that are not covered in Brinton (2008) but cannot be ignored in the ELFA corpus belong to two main categories: iller and interactional devices. As regards the former, again, it is lt's say that i the dominant form. Another fixed expresion so to say was also often used as a filler. In addition, there are various forms of the pattern how $^ +$ say: how to say (it/that), how should I say (it/this), how do I say, how could/can I say, how do you say, how you say (cf. Section 4.3).

With respect to interactional devices, question forms involving sr are often used to elicit response from the addressee, e.g, what do you say, what would you say, would you say that, can you say that, can you say something, did you say that. Such questions can take various forms, most of which occur only once or twice; in other words, no single expression seems to be preferred by the speakers as a Whole. However, when it comes to phrases used to respond to questions or other comment, there seem to be clearer preferences. In addition to I would say and let' say, which were commonly used to begin an answer, the other phrases were employed either when the speaker did not know the answer, e.g., I can't (really)say (exactly/much), its hard/dificult (for me) to say, or when the question addressed implies some kind of criticism, e.g., I have to say (to acknowledge the criticism) (see (5).

# 4.3. Discussion

From the results presented above it is clear that apart from lets say and so to say, idiomatic expressions in the target language as studd n prousstd and is n dir, such  n ay, Il to exp gmet), o c s th gI dare say, needessto say rarely occur in the present study. The use of established formulai sequences in the target language, particularl those that involve metaphorical meanings or pragmatic functions that cannot be directly derived on the basis of their components, requires a common lingustic and cultural background among speakers. In lingua franca communication where there i no such common ground, it is thus undrtandable that spakers would rely primarily on reular grammar either due to ther limited asto prfabricated units in the target language or as a result of a conscious effort to stay away from idiomatic units that can cause difficulty for interactants without a common L1 background. Indeed, previous studies have observed approximation of formulaic language in ELF communi. ation, fing ft liral mnng r the more omtc t es transnt ne . I ll ou tr nst f Ill ll you back) (e.g., Bardovi-Halig, 2009). The types of sAr-expressions employed by the ELF speakers in the present study seem therefore consistent with what has been observed in the literature.

On the surface, the various formal configurations suggest that the open-choice principle is in operation, generated anew at the time of use. However, loking more closely at them together, interesting features f formulaicit can be found. In what follows, some of these features are summarized and discussed with corpus examples.

# 4.3.1. Different forms, same function

As presented in Section 4.2, each function was realized by a range of sar-expressions, which, in turn, can have a number of variant forms. Out of all he main functions, the fillr function is not covered in the literatre deling with the erb sa and is therfore most likely to be typical of ELF communication. Both idiomatic and what seem to be freely generated expressions were frequently used as fillers for the speakers to facilitate their thought process as in the following examples:

(8) so there are like many er er a whole set er a complex, i don't know how to say (it) er a set of er reasons .. (UECD030) (9) so it's how i would say so theres like r rection times rea-reaction time measures with contnuous and then it is e translated to the logarithm which describes this (ULECD110)   
(10) they are not er they are not you don't learn any er the er or how how should i say they are not very, pedagogic or whatever (USEMD03A)   
(11) .. that's what we mean by public spritedness and also  kind of, you might say  wllingnessto m to inolve yourself in thee ublic issues without regard for your own self-interest (ULEC210)   
(12) .. the post-structuralis discourse isomehow the continuing the so to say natural continuation of a secularized western discourse (UDEFD110)   
(13) and now it's cety in amber f couries certinly in holland probaby lso in dmark er the med dont fee inhbited anmore to erm to er associate or yeah let's say associate immigrants with er with er things like crime suppression of women inolerance (ULEC210)

In some cases (e.g. how do I say, I don't know how to say, how I would/should say), the filer function is fairl clear from the litral meaning of the expressions themselves, giving support for the view that L2 users rly on regular grammar to create formulas of their own (Kecskes, 2019). These expressions do not add anything to the proposition in question, but are there simply to help the speaker gain time to think of the right word(s), as in (8), or to reformulate an idea that was somehow abandoned midway, as in (9) and (10). The first personal pronoun can be replaced by you as in (11). The same function was also found in the use of the more idiomatic expressions such as s to say and lets say as in (12) and (13). Many of the filer expressions occur inthe midde of a noun phrase, aead of the head noun, and the speaker's thought proces becomes even more evident given the accompanying repetitions and repairs in different configurations.

# 4.3.2. Same form, different functions

While different forms can be used with the same function, the same form can also be used with different functions. Take I would say as an example. It was often used in association with its prototypical function, namely to give an opinion with a certain degree of uncertainty and willingnes to be corrected, as in (14). Apart from this function, it was also used as a kind of interactive device to express greement, as in (15), or to elicit an answer in response to a question rased in the preceding discourse, as in (16) It occurs twice in (17). The first instance is similar to that in (16), while the second one is somewhat dfferet as no further question was asked, but the speaker used the expression to start the next turn in conversation. The example in (18) illusrates the use of I would say to further clarify what has been said.

(14) ... this is a challenge i would say and i think he succeeds ... (UDEFD140)   
(15) ${ \bf { < S 1 > } }$ ... [do you] mean to cover relations ${ < } / { \bf S 1 > }$ ${ \bf < } { \bf S 2 > }$ yeah yes i would say $i < S 1 > [ ( x x ) J < / S 1 > [ ( x x ) J $ yes yeah okay yes ... (USEMD120)   
(16) ${ < } S 3 { > }$ ... so what erm what then can other regions learn from your from from your findings ${ < } / { S 3 } { > }$ ${ \bf < } { \bf S 2 > }$ erm i would say er first of all networking methods ... (UDEFD020)   
(17) ${ \bf < } { \bf S 3 > }$ mhm, if you split the er the er work load between the two what would you say the split would be ${ < } / { \bf { S 3 } } \mathrm { > }$ ${ < } S 1 > i$ would say that maybe that er the initial design and the whole let's say design process would be maybe 25 per cent of all and the rest would be implementation ${ < } / { \bf S 1 > }$ ${ \bf < } { \bf S 3 > }$ mhm mhm good that's good to know ${ < } / { \bf { S 3 } } \mathrm { > }$ $< s 1 >$ but i would say that there were also quite many ideas that came up in the implementation .. (UDEFD080)   
(18) so it might be interestig toge some comments how people se if they have been abl to create some contacts which they think would be useful want to invit thers to work on some specific er topics or items and aso any feedback on the seminar days we've had now er how we could improve these kind of er gatherings what could we do for the future. so i would say it's sort of open flor for comments and suggestions. (CDIS08B)

The examples above were produced by different speakers. t is thus possible that the expression has been picked up as a whole entity from the speakers experience with the language. The fact that one speaker tends to associate the expresson with a specific function that differs from the usage by another speaker i in line withVetchinnikova's (2015) oservation of the 'recycling f ready-made word sequences in ELF communication. The ready-made sequences are recycled in the sese that the surface structure is preserved intact but the use is marked by a measure of creativity in terms of their communicative function to suit the peakers own needs. More examples of the same expression being use for different functions can be found in the following discussion in relationto personal preference.

# 4.3.3. Personal preference

It emerged from our coding that many speakers have a clear preference for a set of individual expressions. The following examples, all produced by the same speaker, show that the expression lets say, which is typically asociated with the sense for example in English (Brinton, 2008), was used for a variety of purposes.

(19) it's when you are measuring adhesin i always a problem for any for any type of systems because you are measuring very small value. let's say you are working with things like 0.4 up to $1 . 4 M P a ,$ ...(UDEFD010)   
(20) it's very applied let's say there is a very clear industrial aim in the thesis... (UDEFD010)   
(21) ...sometimes the scientific level is not er so good as the as the applied level let's say, ..(UEFD010)   
(22) then you have the resins that are like lets say the the muscles in that wl provide the strength to our to our body .. (UDEFD010) (23) if you go to page nine let's say the adhesive films were prepared by melting the polymer for 15 min at 160 degrees C (UDEFD010)

The example in (19) is a clear case where the conventional function of lt's say is involved, clarifying what very small values means by giving concrete examples. In (20), let's say introduces an explanation of what applied means. It was also found in connection with clearly evaluative terms, such asnot so goo in (21), to expres personal opinions. In (22), lets say seems redundant - the sense of for example is already delivered by the word like the repetition (the the) that follows lets say gives a further indication that the speaker was looking for the right word (musces) whil usingfiller words and phrases to ill the void. In (23), lets say was used to introduce a quotation from a doctoral thesis under discussio. In a way, it may be regarded as having the same function as you say, but the speaker here displayed a particular preference for the expresion lets say. Indeed, the multiple functions of the expression seemto suggest that it may have become what Hasselgren (1994) clls a phrasal teddy bear' that the speaker clings on to regardlessof circumstances.

Different L2 speakers may have different tedy bears. The following examples show how we might say was used by another speaker with multipl functions fillr in (24) and atitude marker in (25). However, ulike let's sy, which is inariable in form, the teddy bear in this case can take slightly different forms where the subject slot can be flled by other pronouns such as you and one. The expression you might say in (26), for instance, has exactly the same function as we might say in (25): both occur together with an evaluative term (opportunity, difficult) and have the same sentential position (at the end of the proposition).

(24) . the im-the immigant culture sil serves functions such as em er we might say providing a kind of psychological shltr for them.. (ULEC210)   
(25) it gives immigrants job opportunities gives them erm an opportunity to er to be-become upwardly socilly mobile we might say (ULEC210)   
(26) it's er always quite different dificult to distinguish precisely between these various strands you might say .. (ULEC210)

The following examples were produced by a different speaker in a presentation. In adition to some formal variaility (what vs. s) personal er s alsvidt i ms functon xal nce), tese/ast ( rft), and tl ption mid VP).

(27) we have aso many ntions wth difernt size f eonmies cultures nd this has hd er positive t-er that's what ave said ositive strategy to regional integration that ... (CPRE051)   
(28) erm latin american countries have not had reached out as i have said to regional integration due to this . (CPRE051)   
(29) we have wo developed countries there and e the rest we osider deeloping countries there ise this efort to unite the eonomies as i have already said to form this free trade area er ... (CPRE051)

The same can be said of the sy-expressions in (30) and (31), with the use of the progressive aspect and the accompanying discourse marker like. All the expressions were used to introduce direct or indirect speech, atributing a proposition to someone else.

(30) ...i remember lik at one time er president was saying like that er the country has er pproximate of 36 million people and he was saying like almost if the debt is distributed to each and every person in the country ... (UsEMD100) (31) HIV is like ecause it's it's global thing and everybody's just saying like yeah HIV's killd a lot of people . (UsEMD100)

To sum up, personal preference is not only associated with invariable expressions; i can also manifest itelf through formal variations. In the latter case,taken individuall, the various formal configurations may appear to be frely generated according to the open-choice principle. However, when they are put together, the same underlying patern (in terms of tense/aspect choice, sentential position, accompanying element(s) function) suggests that the pattern itelf may be treated as a holistic entity where there are both fixed elements and open slots to be filled freely.

# 5. Conclusion

Focusing on one word has made it possble to provide a comprehensive picture of its phraseological patterns in the one-million.

word ELFA corpus, thereby shedding further light on features of formulaicity that characterize academic ELF communication and their relationship with a range of factors such as event type, discipline, and individual preference.

To recap the main findings, first of all non-compositional expressions in the target language rarely occur in the present investigation, corroborating a well-observed tendency among ELF speakers in general to use transparent expressions (Bardovi-Halig, 2009; Kecskes, 2019; Pitzl, 2012). The fact that most sA-expressions produced by ELF speakers in the present study can be broken up into their component parts may suggest the operation of analytical processig, which L2 speakers are said to depend on primaril (Pawley & Syder, 1983; Sinclair, 1991; Wray 2008, 2012). However, taken together, i could also be argued that those seemingly transparent expressions display formulaic features that point to a holistic approach to a certain extent. To begin with, some expressions that are commonly seen in the target language (e.g., lts say, I would say) are often used verbatim, but with variations in function. These expressions may be, to useVetchinnikova's (2015) term, recycled directly from 2 users experience with the target language in terms of their surface structure, but they are used with a certain degree f creativity in terms of their communicative function to meet the speakers ow needs at the moment of us, such as the need to gain time without relying too much on trditional fillr words e like, you know), which may diminish their communication style. In other words, it isalso possble that L2 users have memorized these sequences that they are exposed to as whole entities, but use them in their own ways. Indeed, throughout he study, there isevidence suggesting not only that the same expresion can be used with dfferent functions, even by the same speaker, but the same function can also be fulfilled by a wide variety of expressions.

Even with those expressions that display formal variabilit, i is questionable whether they can always be taken as novel comb. nations built from individual words and grammatical rules. Amid various formal configurations produced by individual speaker (e., we/you might say, he/everybody/president was saying like), certain elements remain stable (such as tense choice, underlying syntactic structure). More importantly, each underlying syntactic pattern seems to be tied up with afixed function (e.g.,  might say to express opinion, X was saying like to introduce a direct or indirect quotation). All these features seem to be in line with the theories about formulaic language use in ELF communication such as approximation and fixing (Mauranen, 2012; Vetchinnikova, 2015), both of which suggest holistic language processing. While approximation or fixing often involves some local loosening of a non-compositional xpression ., carvd in stones vs. carve in stone) (Pit, 2012), the preent study sgts ht th holistic aroach is als likly to be in place with those that appear to be rule-governed expressions, which for some reason may have become fixed to a certain extent among individual speakers. The loosening' in turn may be seen as taking the form of a few open slots in the pattern, which may be filled according to the open-choice principle. The use of sr-expressions therefore suggests that phraseological paterning in ELF may well be a result of both holistic and analytical mechanisms working together.

Overall, these features sem compatible with what is reported in the literature about ELF communication. However, without a comparable non-ELF corpus, which is a major limitation of the present study, it remains to be validated with empirical evidence Whether these features are indeed unique to ELF. For that purpose, the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (Simpson et al., 1999), which contains data produced by both L1-and L2-English speakers in a variety of event types and disciplines, would be a potentially useful comparison corpus for future research. Notwithstanding the need for further investigation, the versatility of sAY-expresions as demonstrated by the ELF speakers under study certainly warrants more attention to those formulaic expressions that are perhaps les salient than what ae commonly taught in EAP claes and ther role i facilitating spoken academic communication in the teaching of EAP.

On balance, it seems that event types and individual preferences are more likely to afect the frequency and use of sar-expressions than academic disciplines. This does not mean that discipline is an irrelevant variable to investigate in research on spoken academic discourse, t it do rthe questonf i i sile t ook  the efet f one ariable indendnt f the thers. In ddtion, as the present study involves one communication verb say and it phraseological patterns, the nature of the verb may decide that event types and even individual preferences are more likely to influence their frequency and usage. This makes it even more complicated if we are to establish the relationship between formulaic language use in general, including formulaic sequences that involve different key words, and relevant contextual and individual variables. In that sense, the present study has given rise to further questions for future research to explore.
