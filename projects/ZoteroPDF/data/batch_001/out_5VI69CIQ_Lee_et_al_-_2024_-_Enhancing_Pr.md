# Abstract

Although Global Englishes (GE) research continues to grow in English language teaching (ELT), the role of technology in enhancing GE awareness remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, the study investigates the potential of English as a lingua franca (ELF) interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in raising GE awareness. Using a quasi-experimental design, 97 South Korean preservice English teachers were divided into a control group (CG, $n = 3 2$ ) and two experimental groups (EG1, $n = 3 1$ ; EG2, $n = 3 4$ ) for 16-week teacher-training courses. The CG received no GE instruction, while EG1 conducted a presentation task and EG2 interacted with AI chatbots in 3D metaverse environments. We used a mixed-methods approach of pre- and post-test surveys and interviews. ANCOVA results for survey data showed that both tasks had positive effects on all facets of GE awareness (e.g., acceptance of one's local English, acceptance of other Englishes, native-speakerism, ELF confidence and intention, and willingness to incorporate GELT into teaching), with the AI chatbot task exerting a stronger effect on ELF confidence and intention. For practical implications, the findings outlined pedagogical strategies for integrating GELT into computer-assisted (CA) language learning. Theoretically, we proposed the CA-GELT approach for future research in the era of generative AI technology. doi: 10.1002/tesq.3300

# INTRODUCTION

R ership of English among those who use English as a lingua franca (ELF) for intercultural communication (e.g., Boonsuk, Wasoh, & Ambele, 2022; Fang & Ren, 2018; Rose & Galloway, 2019). Challenging traditional ELT approaches that prioritize the acquisition of native English speaker (NEs) norms in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context, GE reflects the sociocultural fluidity of English use in a global communication context, prompting scholars in second language (L2) studies to reevaluate English use and its users from a pluricentric perspective (Rose & Galloway, 2019). At the heart of this plurality is the notion of ELF, which refers to the "use of English among speakers of different first languages (L1) for whom English is the communicative medium of choice" (Seidlhofer, 2011, p. 7), as ELF usage has become prevalent in global contexts that extend beyond fixed geographical boundaries (Cogo, 2012; Galloway & Rose, 2015).

In line with a paradigm shift in ELT, the Global Englishes Language Teaching (GELT) approach was developed to integrate GE into the ELT curriculum by emphasizing English as a global lingua franca (Galloway & Rose, 2018; Rose & Galloway, 2019). In this context, GE represents an inclusive paradigm that integrates pluricentric perspectives of English use (Rose & Galloway, 2019), such as World Englishes (WE), which highlights different English varieties as discrete entities within specific speech communities (Kachru, 1992), and ELF, empha sizing the fluid and adaptable use of English across regional and linguistic confines (Jenkins, 2015). Recognizing the respective contributions of WE and ELF to understanding the sociolinguistic diversity and fluidity of English use in the contemporary globalized world, GELT not only aims to increase exposure to WE and ELF in language curricula, but also seeks to raise awareness of ELF strategies in ELT among L2 learners, thereby empowering them to be proficient ELF users in diverse communication contexts (Rose & Galloway, 2019). This pedagogical initiative results in diverse instructional methods to enhance GE awareness, including GE courses, direct interventions, and student-driven GE projects (e.g., Boonsuk et al., 2022; Galloway & Rose, 2018).

Technology has been increasingly used to support GELT in two ways (Rose, McKinley, & Galloway, 2021): some focus on facilitating ELF communication (e.g., Jansz & Schreiber, 2021; Ke & Cahyani, 2014), while others raise awareness of diversity in English use (e.g., Eslami, Moody, & Pashmforoosh, 2019; Rajprasit, 2023). They utilized technology tools, including online communication, mobile technology, and multimedia, to influence attitudes toward English use. However, our understanding remains limited about how technology can holistically enhance GE awareness, including attitudes toward English diversity and ELF opportunities. In addition, as Rose et al. (2021) note, further empirical evidence is needed regarding the benefits of advanced technology, including AI chatbots, virtual reality, the metaverse, and generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, and DALL-E3), in raising GE awareness.

To address the gaps, this study, inspired by the pedagogical benefits of AI chatbots and 3D metaverse platforms in L2 learning (Huang, Hew, & Fryer, 2022; Hwang, Tu, & Chu, 2023; Jeon, 2022) and the GELT approach to teacher education (Chen, Chen, & Fang, 2021; Rose & Galloway, 2019), explored the effects of ELF interactions with AI chatbots in metaverse environments on GE awareness. We selected AI chatbots and the metaverse due to their potential to support GELT through authentic communication, immersive learning environments, and effective iterative learning conditions (Huang et al., 2022; Jeon, Lee, & Choe, 2023). Therefore, the study ultimately aimed to explore the feasibility of a computer-assisted GELT (CA-GELT) approach, using advanced technology to enhance GE awareness in a quasiexperimental research design.

# GLOBAL ENGLISHES LANGUAGE TEACHING APPROACH

GE, an inclusive approach to global English use, builds upon the foundational work of pluricentric paradigms such as WE and ELF (Rose et al., 2021). WE addresses the evolution of English varieties across three circles: the Inner Circle (countries where English is a native language), the Outer Circle (countries where English serves as a second or official language), and the Expanding Circle (countries recognizing English as a foreign and international language; Kachru, 1992). Its research is twofold: describing linguistic features and attitudes toward diverse Englishes. The former emphasizes the codification of specific varieties, particularly in the Outer Circle, while the latter examines the acceptance of potential varieties by local speech communities (Galloway & Rose, 2015). ELF, in contrast, critiques WE for narrowly focusing on nation-based varieties, overlooking the sociolinguistic reality of English use in global settings. Instead, ELF explores the adaptable use of English among speakers from different L1s (Cogo, 2012; Fang, 2017). Thus, ELF scholars underscore "its fluidity and online negotiation of meaning among interlocutors with varied multilingual repertoires" across all three circles in ELForiented intercultural communication (Jenkins, 2015, p. 50). In comparison, GE acknowledges the contributions of both WE and ELF to enhancing our comprehension of global English use, emphasizing both the sociolinguistic diversity of English and the fluidity of ELF communication (Galloway & Rose, 2015; Rose & Galloway, 2019).

GELT, introduced by Galloway (2011), probes the pedagogical implications of GE, focusing on shifting "the perceptions of the users of English regarding what English is, who owns it, and how it should be used" (Rose & Galloway, 2019, p. 11). Grounded in the seminal work from WE and ELF, Galloway and Rose (2015) suggested six proposals to incorporate GE into ELT: (1) increasing exposure to WE and ELF; (2) raising GE awareness; (3) raising awareness of ELF strategies; (4) recognizing multilingualism; (5) respecting diverse culture and identity; and (6) changing teacher-hiring practices. Specifically, "students should be exposed to World Englishes, particularly the Outer Circle and Expanding Circle" to "legitimise different varieties of English through exposure to the global uses of the language" (Galloway, 2011, p. 17). Such an endeavor in GELT does not focus on codifying English varieties but on raising students' awareness of diversity in English use, which then may result in successful ELF exposure and usage (Galloway & Rose, 2015). Then, students are expected to comprehend \*how English is used as a global language and how they can use English' by challenging "deeply ingrained native speaker norms" and by increasing \*self-confidence as English users" (Rose & Galloway, 2019, p. 17).

As Rose et al. (2021) observed, to implement these core proposals in ELT, GELT research acknowledges the need to change the attitudes of both teachers and learners. This involves raising GE awareness through the collective insights from WE, ELF, and GELT, such as variation in English use, ELF opportunities, and GE integration into ELT. For instance, Galloway (2013) examined how exposure to WE and ELF influenced Japanese students' attitudes toward English varieties in three circles and their preferences for particular Englishes for ELF interaction. Galloway and Rose (2014) used listening activities with 108 Japanese students to expose Japanese students to diverse Englishes across three circles. A follow-up study by Galloway and Rose (2018) reported students' raised GE awareness through presentation tasks regarding diverse English varieties across three circles, as well as classroom GE activities on ELF reflections. Boonsuk et al. (2022) adopted direct instructional interventions, including receptive (e.g., exposure to Southeast Asian Englishes through videos and film) and productive activities (e.g., ELF interaction with international students) in teacher education. Their findings showed teachers' enhanced awareness of non-native Englishes and their appreciation of ELF opportunities. Galloway and Numajiri (2020) examined the feasibility of incorporating GELT into curriculum innovation, highlighting some factors on teachers' willingness to integrate GELT into their teaching, such as curriculum design, pedagogical backgrounds, and stakeholders' expectations.

In sum, research underscores the importance of pedagogical interventions, GE-informed curricula, and GELT-oriented teacher education in raising GE awareness. While there have been criticisms around the concept of "variety" and the nation-centric naming of Englishes, these studies recognized the efficacy of the three-circle model in "raising awareness of varieties of English... and awareness of variations in English and issues of ownership" when "the term expanding [in the three-circle model] implies a process of growth' of English use in global contexts (Galloway & Rose, 2015, p. 23). Such GELT initiatives contributed to increased ELF exposure and opportunities, resulting in L2 students' enhanced ELF confidence and intention in "the use of English across and between all three of Kachru's circles" (Galloway & Rose, 2015, p. 169).

# RAISING GLOBAL ENGLISHES AWARENESS WITH TECHNOLOGY

Technology has served two functions in addressing GE topics (Rose et al., 202): (1) increasing awareness of English diversity and (2) enabling ELF interaction. Some technologies, such as mobile devices and multimedia resources, have been utilized to foster GE awareness. For example, Bozoglan and Gok (2017) used WhatsApp to influence Turkish pre-service teachers' attitudes towards non-standard Englishes, reporting positive results despite British English scoring the highest. Eslami et al. (2019) utilized YouTube clips to educate teachers about WE, resulting in heightened awareness of different cultures. Similarly, Rajprasit (2023) utilized both receptive and productive activities to enhance Thai students' positive attitudes toward English varieties.

Studies also highlight the effectiveness of technology in facilitating ELF communication. Ke and Suzuki (2011) employed asynchronous online tools for web-based ELF communication between Taiwanese and Japanese students. Participants expressed preferences for NES norms but also positivity toward online ELF opportunities. Ke and Cahyani (2014) also utilized asynchronous communication, involving Turkish and Indonesian students in ELF activities, which boosted participants' acceptance of their local English, reduced native-speakerism, and increased interest in ELF. Jansz and Schreiber (2021) engaged Sri Lankan students in online discussions with American students, helping them recognize lingual-cultural differences.

Research demonstrates that technology tools can influence attitudes toward English diversity and ELF interaction; however, cutting-edge technologies, such as synchronous videoconferencing tools, virtual reality, and AI chatbots, are rarely used for authentic ELF communication. Moreover, despite growing interest in technology use for GELT, there is limited knowledge on how it can holistically enhance GE awareness, encompassing attitudes and ELF interaction. Finally, as Rose et al. (2021) noted, the reliability of previous results may be ques. tioned due to a lack of quasi-experimental design.

# EXPLORING CA-GELT: INSIGHTS FROM CHATBOTGELT RESEARCH

A chatbot, software programmed for verbal communication with humans, has been used to enhance language learning over the past few decades (Jeon et al., 2023). Initially text-based, chatbots have evolved into AI chatbots, conducting language tasks with L2 students with AI technology such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP; Kim, Yang, & Lee, 2022). Scholars have explored their benefits in L2 learning, including psychological support, improving speaking and listening skills, and assessing learner perception (e.g., Jeon, 2022; Lee & Jeon, 2022).

Upon Rose et al.'s (2021) call for adopting advanced technology in GELT research, we suggest utilizing AI chatbots and 3D metaverse platforms to raise GE awareness by exposing pre-service teachers to diversity of English use and ELF communication. Figure 1 proposes the technological functions of AI chatbots and the metaverse for AI-human communication to support ELF-oriented training. First, AI chatbots serve as human-like conversation partners, supporting verbal communication (Jeon et al., 2023). We propose that an AI chatbot's communicative function might align with ELF communication when it mirrors the speech of a specific English speaker and interacts with a human interlocutor (Lee & Jeon, 2023; Rose & Galloway, 2019). To achieve this, advanced NLP technology is required to clone and replicate an individual's speech based on extensive language performance data from that person (Zhang & Lin, 2022). When the model speaker for an AI chatbot originates from a linguistic and cultural background different from the human interlocutor, their exchange may parallel ELF communication between speakers from diverse lingua-cultural backgrounds (Jenkins, 2015; Seidlhofer, 2011). Second, AI chatbots promote task-based learning, enabling L2 learners to enhance their communication skills through meaning negotiation strategies (Kim et al., 2022). This AI chatbot function in goal-oriented language learning is akin to ELF speakers' use of pragmatic strategies in communication situations to achieve mutual understanding (Sung, 2020). Third, a conversation with AI chatbots might offer psychological benefits by creating an "anxiety-free atmosphere' because this can help reduce social anxieties, such as peer pressure and fear of making speaking mistakes, when students interact with a non-human partner (Jeon, 2022, p. 1). This benefit is similar to ELF communication, where ELF speakers feel \*comfortable speaking, not emphasizing "native-like or perfect English in ELF communication but appearing to be tolerant and accepting of any deviations from native English" (Sung, 2020, p. 263). Finally, metaverse platforms provide a range of benefits, including authentic communication, immersive learning environments, and a comfortable virtual space (Hwang et al., 2023; Jeon, Lee, & Choe, 2022). These features have the potential to support ELF communication within the ELF community, fostering authentic

FIGURE 1. Affordances of AI chatbots and the metaverse that support ELF interaction.

English use and comfortable verbal exchange (Mu, Lee, & Choe, 2023; Rose & Galloway, 2019). However, a potential challenge emerges in drawing parallels between AI chatbot conversations and ELF communication because AI chatbots currently designed for educational purposes typically produce only native speech (Lee & Jeon, 2023; Markl & Lai, 2021). As Lee and Jeon (2023) observed, interacting with such AI chatbots might prompt L2 students to imitate native English speech, potentially diminishing their intentions for ELF communication. To address this concern, this study designed AI chatbots that articulate diverse Englishes, allowing participants to engage in ELF-like interactions with them.

Drawing on the literature review of technology use in GE (e.g., Eslami et al., 2019; Jansz & Schreiber, 2021; Rajprasit, 2023) and the integration of GE into AI technology (Lee & Jeon, 2023; Markl & Lai, 2021), we propose a CA-GELT approach as a model that integrates computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and GELT for research (Figure 2). On the one hand, Rose et al. (2021) suggest these affordances can enhance GE awareness, covering pluricentric English views, ELF communication, and GE incorporation into ELT (Chen et al., 2021; Fang & Ren, 2018; Rose & Galloway, 2019). On the other hand, we suggest integrating the GE perspective in CALL research, given that CALL traditionally targets native speech for language learning (Lee & Jeon, 2023; Markl & Lai, 2021). Figure 2 presents the CAGELT model, providing potential research topics on the interface between CALL and GELT.

FIGURE 2. CA-GELT: the integrated model of the CALL and GELT interface.

Drawing on AI chatbots and metaverse affordances and the GE perspective on ELT curriculum innovation in teacher training, this study explores the effect of using AI chatbots in metaverse spaces on raising pre-service teachers' GE awareness and their perceptions of ELF interaction with AI chatbots. This study addresses the following research questions (RQs):

1. What are the effects of presentation and AI chatbot activities on Korean pre-service English teachers' awareness of Global Englishes?   
2. How do pre-service teachers perceive the overall effects of these activities on their awareness of Global Englishes?

# THE STUDY

The study adopted a mixed-methods design to examine the potential effect of presentation and AI chatbot tasks on pre-service teachers' GE awareness (Dornyei, 2007). Specifically, a quantitative approach was first used for collecting survey data to answer RQ1, followed by a qualitative research method for interview data to address RQ2.

# Participants and Context

The study involved 97 Korean pre-service English teachers (18 males, 79 females, aged 20-25) from a South Korean university. The gender imbalance among the participants in this study reflects the male-to-female student enrollment ratio in the English Educa tion program at the university. They were enrolled in English teacher-training courses, including English Language Teaching Methods and English Language Teaching Material Development in Fall 2022. They completed English language courses and reported their English skills as lower to upper-intermediate levels. We purposefully selected these courses as they included lectures on teaching methods, lesson planning, and teaching demonstrations. None of them had prior experience of learning about GE. Overall, the participants formed a homogeneous group due to similar admission standards, policy framework, course participation, and initial GE awareness levels. Accordingly, they were split into one control group (CG, $n = 3 2$ ) and two experimental groups (EG1, $n = 3 1$ ;EG2, $n = 3 4$ ).

# Research Procedure

Drawing on previous research on GE awareness strategies (e.g., Boonsuk et al., 2022; Galloway & Rose, 2018) and the benefits of AI chatbots and the metaverse (Hwang et al., 2023; Jeon et al., 2022), all three groups received lectures on English language teaching methods (see Figure 3). Unlike the CG who followed the standard course schedule, EG1 and EG2 received additional lectures on various GE topics, encompassing WE, the spread of English, and ELF communication, to raise their GE awareness (Galloway & Rose, 2015; Rose & Galloway, 2019). Specifically, drawing on Galloway (2013), Galloway and Rose (2014, 2018), and Fang and Ren (2018), we first introduced to EG1 and EG2 WE-related content, focusing on diversity in English use and the ownership of English through WE exposure. Next, following Galloway and Numajiri (2020), Rose et al. (2021), Boonsuk et al., (2022), and Mu et al., (2023), we delivered ELF-related content through exposure to ELF communication in global contexts.

Two EGs conducted distinct tasks beyond these core lectures. Replicating Galloway and Rose's (2014, 2018) approach, we prompted EG1 to complete a group task where they selected five Englishes they preferred to explore and engage with. They were further asked to conduct a presentation task on one local English. The first task aimed to "expose students to many non-standard English varieties," while the second one sought to let them "more deeply engage with one specific regional English variety of their own choice" (Galloway & Rose, 2018, p. 6). Consequently, their presentation covered Englishes such as Singaporean $( n = 7$ ), Australian $[ n = 5$ ), New Zealand $( n = 4$ ), Philippine $( n = 4$ , Chinese $( n = 4 )$ ,Thai $( n = 3$ , Japanese $( n = 2 )$ , Indian $\ b _ { \mathscr { n } } = 1$ ), and South African $\ b _ { \mathscr { n } } = 1$ ). We recognized the inherent limitation in categorizing diverse Englishes using Kachru's WE model as it may convey a bias, framing various English uses as fixed entities or varieties. Nevertheless, such WE exposure activities are useful in "raising awareness of the diversity of English around the world" (Galloway & Rose, 2015, p. 142) and in enhancing "students' confidence as legitimate users of a global language" (Galloway & Rose, 2018, p. 12), showing the global ownership of English.

![](img/e99476fe792e8cb5fc4024919bee6888cad10bf1c297b66ea8b115445831c4f4.jpg)  
FIGURE 3. Research procedure.Note: ELTM, English Language Teaching Methods.

Following Boonsuk et al's (2022) study on raising GE awareness in the Thai context, which adopted ELF interaction between Thai students and foreign students from Malaysia, China, and Cambodia, etc., EG2 engaged with three-stage AI chatbot tasks in 3D metaverse spaces (see Figure 3). To design AI chatbots that speak five Englishes, we initially employed five human agents with diverse L1 backgrounds: Australia, Singapore, the Philippines, China, and Thailand, based on the participants' autonomous choices (Galloway & Rose, 2018). Each speaker held a bachelor's degree, could communicate in English, identified with their regional English, and had at least 2 years of ELF experience. Speaker profiles are offered in Table 1.

Drawing on research on AI chatbots as conversation partners (Kim et al., 2022), we aimed to offer all participants consistent communication experiences in a systematic way through three-stage conversation tasks with AI chatbots by using their ELF strategies. To achieve this, we designed three chatbot tasks: (1) a text-based chatbot task, (2) a speech-recognition chatbot task for goal-oriented dialogue, and (3) a speech-recognition chatbot task for daily conversation (see Figure 4). First, following chatbot-building guidelines (Kim et al., 2022), we developed text-based chatbot tasks, including direction-giving and ordering tasks. We created chatbot prompts and responses by inter viewing five English speakers (see Table 1). The chatbots were then integrated into a screen in 3D metaverse spaces (see Figure 4). Figure 5 provides a sample dialogue flowchart.

The second and third tasks involved speech-recognition chatbots that speak five Englishes. Due to the limitations of NLP technology at the time of data collection, we used the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) method, a well-known, established research method in the field of humancomputer interaction where human operators control chatbot responses while participants believe they communicate with intelligent systems (Kim, Hwang, Lim, Cho, & Lee, 2023; Riek, 2012). Many researchers have utilized WoZ to effectively simulate autonomous agents, such as intelligent robots and virtual agents like chatbots and avatars, because a target technology is "not sufficiently advanced to interact autonomously with people. [...] this kind of puppeteering allows participants to envision what future interaction could be like" despite the limitation that agents controlled by WoZ are not true AI systems (Riek, 2012, p. 119). In this study, five human speakers with different L1 backgrounds were trained to operate their chatbots to interact with EG2 participants in English. In this way, we expected EG2 to interact with these five English speakers, who controlled AI chatbots, experiencing the use of ELF strategies. We embedded the AI chatbots into 3D avatars in metaverse environments for their immersive and engaging experiences in intercultural communication (Hwang et al., 2023; Jeon et al., 2022).

FIGURE 4. Chatbot tasks in 3D metaverse environments.   
FIGURE 5. Sample dialogue flowchart of a text-based chatbot.

EG2 participants conducted AI chatbot tasks over 12 weeks (see Figure 1). From Week 3 to Week 6, they interacted with text-based chatbots, performing information gap activities for 10 minutes twice a week. From Week 7 to Week 10, they conducted similar information gap tasks, speaking with chatbot-embedded avatars in metaverse spaces. The final task from Week 11 to Week 14 involved daily conversation topics with the avatars (see Figure 3). Each student spent 10-15 minutes weekly on Tasks 2 and 3 during classes.

# Data Collection and Analysis

To ensure data triangulation, we collected data using mixed methods, including survey questionnaires and focus-group interviews (Dornyei, 2007). For RQ1, a pre- and post-test design was used to measure the participants' GE awareness before and after the experiment. We developed a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire encompassing six constructs from relevant literature on GE. The constructs include acceptance of one's local English (ALE) (Boonsuk & Fang, 2022; Fang & Ren, 2018), acceptance of other Englishes (AOE) (Fang & Ren, 2018), native-speakerism (NS) (Rose & Galloway, 2019; Sung, 2020), confidence in ELF communication (CELF) (Mu et al., 2023; Sung, 2020), ELF communication intention (ELFI) (Cao & Wei, 2019; Mu et al., 2023), and willingness to incorporate GELT into teaching (WGT) (Chen et al., 2021; Galloway & Numajiri, 2020). Appendix A illustrates survey items. We administered the questionnaire to all groups in Week 1 after introducing basic concepts about Global Englishes. The reliability of the survey items was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha, which exceeded the 0.7 threshold. We redistributed the same questionnaire as a post-test in Week 15.

The survey data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine potential differences among the three groups (CG, EG1, and EG2) in post-test results for the six survey constructs, controlling for pre-test results. For this analysis, the pre-test scores served as covariates and post-test scores as dependent variables. Prior to operating ANCOVA, we ensured the homogeneity of the data sets $( F = 0 . 2 6 6$ $p > . 0 5 )$ , confirming its appropriateness as an analysis method.

To address RQ2, exploring participants' perceptions of their GE awareness activities, we conducted focus-group interviews with EG1 and EG2 in Week 16. We explored their experiences and voices regarding survey responses. Interviews were first conducted in Korean, then audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Appendix B offers sample interview questions. We analyzed the interview data via reflexive thematic analysis, using the open-source tool Taguette to code data and identify themes relevant to RQ2 (Braun & Clarke, 2021). We conducted initial open-coding guided by the GE perspective and generated themes, including 'I feel more openminded to Singapore English after the activity"' coded as the enhanced acceptance of other English varieties (Boonsuk & Fang, 2022), "I found my English acceptable for a conversation with the chatbot" as the acceptance of a local English variety (Sung, 2020), \*I still believe I should learn American English" as native-speakerism (Galloway & Rose, 2018), and \*I'd like to have more chances to talk with diverse English speakers" as ELF communication intention (Cao & Wei, 2019). In this stage, we used both inductive and deductive coding methods to discover diverse emerging themes regarding various aspects of GE awareness among the participants, acknowledging the subjective nature of thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2021). We then grouped similar codes into categories and cross-referenced them with the original data. To prevent potential coder biases, we conducted an inter-coder reliability test, obtaining a satisfactory level (Cohen's kappa $= 0 . 8 1 $ :

# RESULTS

# Analysis of Survey Items Regarding GE Awareness

After controlling for the effects of the pre-test scores, the ANCOVA results showed that there were statistically significant differences among the three groups in all survey items (see Table 2). To be spe cific, Table 2 shows that the responses of EG1 and EG2 participants were significantly higher than those of CG participants in all six survey items, with $F$ values ranging from 79.1 to 524.8 and $p < . 0 0 1$ . The results indicate that the two GE activities had a positive influence on the participants' GE awareness.

The analysis of post-hoc comparisons with Tukey tests displayed the differences between the groups in detail. The results revealed that EG1 and EG2 reported significantly more positive perceptions than CG in all six items, $p < . 0 0 1$ (see Table 2). Next, the scores given by EG2 were significantly higher than those given by EG1 in CELF and ELFI, $p < . 0 0 1$ . The results indicate that while both presentation (EG1) and AI chatbot activities (EG2) had a positive effect on the participants' perceptions regarding all six items, including ALE, AOE, NS, CELF, ELFI, and WGT, AI chatbot activities, which were integrated in 3D metaverse spaces, had a more positive effect on the participants' GE awareness than presentation activities in terms of ELF communication confidence and intention.

# Analysis of Interview Data

Since the main topic of the current study is the effect of AI chatbot activities on GE awareness in comparison with no treatment and presentation activities, the demonstration of salient themes focuses on EG2 participants' interview responses, while those of EG1 participants are provided for comparison purposes. We used the participant number and group to keep their identities confidential.

Enhanced acceptance of diverse English varieties. Before joining this study, participants expressed concern regarding the intelligibility of their own and other Englishes, as well as exposure to non-standard Englishes. First, many participants $n = 3 6$ from both EGs worried they would not be able to understand other Englishes, while some - ${ \mathrm { ~ ~ } } _ { n } = 2 1$ ) worried their English would not be understandable to those from different L1 backgrounds. For example, Participant 2 in EG2 was afraid that "we can't understand each other due to different accents." Others $( n = 8 )$ worried about being exposed to non-standard Englishes. "I was worried that I could be exposed to non-standard English when I talked with non-native speakers, like Chinese or Thai people," said Participant 14 in EG2.

Most EG2 participants ${ \bf \rho } _ { n } = { \bf \rho } _ { 2 7 } \cdot { \bf \rho } _ { . }$ found AI chatbot activities beneficial in increasing their awareness of diverse Englishes. They felt the activities offered authentic experiences similar to actual ELF conversations, leading to acceptance of English diversity for intercultural communication. Participant 5 in EG2 noted, 'I got familiar with Singaporean English through the activities... I found it enjoyable to talk with avatars that speak diverse Englishes because it felt like I spoke with a real Singaporean." Furthermore, many of them ${ \bf \Phi } _ { n } = 1 9 { \bf \Phi } _ { , }$ acknowledged the authenticity of their own English after ELF communication with AI chatbots. For instance, one participant reflected that "my Korean English surprised me due to its usefulness in communicating with foreigners" (Participant 7, EG2).

In comparison, EG1 participants noted different factors influencing their acceptance of diverse Englishes. Participants $n = 2 2$ ) reported recognizing the linguistic and cultural value of diverse Englishes after engaging in research and presentations on English plurality. Participant 12 shared, "I found so many varieties of English spoken worldwide, reflecting their unique linguistic and cultural aspects." Those who accepted the diversity of English seemed to accept their English as one of the varieties, with one participant reflecting, "If we can accept Englishes like Chinese or Thai, why not my Korean English?" (Participant 25, EG1).

Reduced native-speakerism. Interviews revealed that participants in both groups adhered to NES norms prior to their participation in GE presentations and AI chatbot tasks. The majority ${ \bf \nabla } _ { n } = 4 3 { \bf \cdot }$ viewed those who spoke standard English as fluent and authentic, reflecting, 'I believed English is their language, and we learn it from native English teachers at school' (Participant 24, EG2). Those exhibiting this native-speakerism felt standard English was superior in intelligibility, as Participant 1 in EG1 commented, "English speakers worldwide are familiar with English as a native language, like Koreans who mostly favor American English."

However, AI chatbot activities encouraged critical reflection on the authenticity of their own English and other varieties, fostering a sense of ownership. They were surprised to find, "My English worked perfectly for international communication, and I could understand their English" (Participant 27, EG2). Another noted, "We don't have to speak exactly like native speakers because I found them so fluent even when speaking their own English" (Participant 20, EG2).

Meanwhile, EG1 reflected on the practicality of using non-native Englishes for ELF communication in such domains as business, educa tion, and entertainment. Some students $\mathbf { \Phi } _ { n } = 1 3$ emphasized the global status of English by stating, "I realized English is effectively used by diverse non-native speakers worldwide" (Participant 16, EG1). Par ticipant 19 from EG1 also noted, "The existence of diverse English varieties relieved the stress of having to speak in their English."

However, interview data revealed that students still maintained native-speakerism, seemingly tied to their identity as prospective English teachers. Some $\mathbf { \Phi } _ { n } = 1 4$ felt that mastering standard English was essential for success in their teaching careers, especially in South Korea.

I accept non-native Englishes globally, but as a future English teacher, I want to master standard English. This seems particularly crucial in the Korean context, where students often expect their teachers to speak standard English. (Participant 3, EG2).

Increased confidence and intention regarding ELF communication. Participants in EG2 further argued for the benefits of AI chatbot activities in their increased confidence in ELF communication. This confidence appears related to their enhanced awareness of English diversity, as one reported, \*I felt more confident in my English when I could communicate with different English speakers' (Participant 22, EG2). It also appeared linked to ELF communication opportunities with AI chatbots, which seemed to alleviate their fears of communicating with real people, potentially enhancing their ELF confidence.

I felt fine talking with native speakers because they are like English teachers, but I was afraid that I couldn't understand Singaporean or Filipino English. However, I felt much more comfortable interacting with avatars that spoke these Englishes... because they exist virtually in the metaverse. (Participant 9, EG2).

The staged communication with AI chatbots further stimulated their interest in other Englishes for ELF communication practices. Participant 8 in EG2 stated, "I'd like to speak with real Singaporeans later. I want to know more about their culture."

EG1 also exhibited positive intentions for ELF communication. However, unlike EG2 students, they raised concerns about successful communication with non-native speakers due to a lack of extensive interactions, as Participant 15 explained, 'I haven't had a long conversation with non-native speakers before." Consequently, their ELF confidence appears less developed compared to EG2 due to this lack of actual experience.

Incorporating GELT into ELT curriculum. EG2 participants, after completing the courses, showed positive attitudes towards integrating GELT into ELT curricula. Some $\mathbf { \Phi } _ { n } = 1 2$ ) advocated for incorporating GELT in secondary school English classes to "raise students' awareness of different Englishes and nurture global citizens" (Participant 16, EG2). Others ( ${ \bf \Phi } _ { n } = { \bf \Phi } 9$ ) emphasized the need to include GELT in CALL courses. One participant highlighted the potential of ASR technology to encompass non-native accents, expressing surprise at "how chatbots in the course understood my accent and other non-native Englishes, which other chatbots often struggled with' (Participant 30, EG2).

After AI chatbot activities, some $n = 1 0 \mathrm { . }$ suggested that teacher education should incorporate GELT into their courses, especially CALL-related courses. They argued that these programs need to move away from the focus on NES norms, including NES accents, towards embracing a pluricentric view of English. One student (Participant 16) from EG2 criticized the prevalent focus on native English in a CALL course named Multimedia-Assisted Language Teaching, suggesting that "a GELT perspective should align better with the national curriculum's emphasis on global citizenship." Meanwhile, EG1 participants $( n = 7 )$ supported GELT integration into ELT to promote understanding of diverse Englishes but did not discuss CALL courses.

In contrast, some participants $\mathbf { \Phi } _ { \cdot n } = 1 1$ ) from both EGs expressed reservations about incorporating GELT into the ELT curriculum. They maintained a focus on standard English in teaching, recognizing the socio-economic prestige of standard English in South Korea. Participant 6 from EG2 elaborated on this perspective, acknowledging "the need to focus on standard English for students' future success, given the strong socio-economic influence of American English in Korea." Participant 14 from EG1 also mentioned that "it won't be easy to teach non-standard Englishes in Korea when considering the strong economic relationship between Korea and the United States."

# DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS

We employed a CA-GELT approach with AI chatbot-assisted ELF communication activities in metaverse environments to enhance GE awareness among pre-service teachers. We also explored the impact of these activities on the participants' GE awareness and looked into their perceptions.

Addressing RQ1, which focused on the effects of AI chatbots and presentation activities on GE awareness, ANCOVA results demonstrated both activities positively impacted GE awareness when compared to the control group. This first aligns with previous research that emphasized the benefits of multimodal presentation tasks for developing students' GE awareness (e.g., Boonsuk et al., 2022; Rajprasit, 2023). While they focused on raising awareness and acceptance of Englishes and native-speakerism, our study expanded the scope by incorporating more diverse factors, such as local and other English acceptance, ELF confidence and intention, and GELT integration into the ELT curriculum. Moreover, our findings endorse Rose et al.'s (2021) call for using advanced technology to enhance GE awareness. Unlike previous studies that employed online communication for in-class or out-of-class activities but lacked a robust quasiexperimental design (e.g., Jansz & Schreiber, 2021; Rajprasit, 2023), we incorporated pre- and post-tests, comparison groups, and a mixedmethods approach, highlighting the efficacy of AI technology in cultivating diverse aspects of GE awareness. (Rose et al., 2021).

The quantitative analysis further underscores the comparative advantage of the AI chatbot task over the presentation task in enhancing ELF confidence and intention. This suggests that AI chatbots could be a promising tool for heightening GE awareness, particularly for EFL communication (Mu et al., 2023; Rose et al., 2021). A possible explanation is that the interaction with virtual agents that speak diverse English varieties may have amplified their confidence and intentions for ELF interaction in a manner comparable to ELF communication between human speakers in an international context (Sung, 2020). Also, Boonsuk et al. (2022) pointed out that actual ELF communication activities can facilitate students' motivation to engage in ELF communication.

Addressing RQ2, the thematic analysis of interviews gave deeper insights into participants' experiences with the tasks for GE awareness. Although ANCOVA results displayed no significant differences between the two task groups in four areas, namely acceptance of local and other Englishes, native-speakerism, and the willingness to integrate GELT into ELT, interviews revealed noticeable gaps in how each task contributed to enhanced GE awareness. Consistent with previous research claiming the benefits of ELF opportunities in developing students' familiarity, awareness, and acceptance of language variations (Mu et al., 2023; Rose & Galloway, 2019; Sung, 2020), ELF interaction with AI chatbots embodied as 3D avatars in metaverse environments exposed the participants to diverse Englishes, reduced their nativespeakerism, and strengthened their sense of ownership of English. Conversely, the presentation task broadened their understanding of linguistic diversity, leading participants to accept their local English as one of the many global Englishes (Galloway & Rose, 2018; Rajprasit, 2023).

Aligned with ANCOvA results demonstrating the superiority of three-staged chatbot tasks over presentation tasks in facilitating ELF confidence and intention, interview data indicate that interactions with AI chatbots can facilitate ELF experiences in diverse ways, including ELF communication, social presence, and emotional support (Huang et al., 2022; Jeon, 2022). Interviewees reported increased confidence and intent to use ELF, noticing parallels between their interaction with 3D avatars and real-life communication with ELF speakers, along with comfort in the virtual spaces. Existing research suggests that actual ELF experiences can enhance ELF speakers' L2 confidence (Sung, 2020), the intent for further ELF interaction (Cao & Wei, 2019), and the creation of an affinity space centered around ELF users' shared norms and solidarity (Rose & Galloway, 2019). This study extends this understanding of ELF practices by integrating the CAGELT approach, drawing on the pedagogical benefits of AI chatbots such as communication affordances as a conversation partner (Jeon, 2022), social presence as human-like agents (Jeon, 2022), and emotional support for language learning (Huang et al., 2022; Jeon, 2022). Beyond these benefits from chatbots, interviews suggest that metaverse environments can provide immersive, comfortable communication environments for students who express fears about ELF interaction (Jeon et al., 2022).

In terms of integrating GELT into the ELT curriculum, both groups exhibited positive attitudes, but the chatbot group specifically argued for the inclusion of the GELT perspective into two ELT domains: multimedia-assisted English classes and technology-based teacher education. First, adopting a GE viewpoint, they criticized the current ASR technology that uses native English and struggles with non-native accents. Furthermore, they stated that CALL courses in teacher education should help pre-service teachers escape from native-speakerism by adopting a pluricentric view. This finding echoes Lee and Jeon (2023), which revealed critical thoughts on the limitations of current chatbot technology regarding non-native speech. However, as several previous studies have noted (e.g., Fang & Ren, 2018; Galloway & Rose, 2018; Rose & Galloway, 2019), some participants showed reluctance towards introducing GELT into ELT. One reason relates to the significant socio-economic influence of American English in Korean society, which aligns with Choe and Lee's (2023) findings on the perceived socio-economic value of standard English among stakeholders in South Korea.

The findings offer several pedagogical and academic implications. First, consistent with Boonsuk et al. (2022), pedagogical activities for GE awareness could include not only knowledge-based tasks but also authentic ELF interactions. Our results suggest AI chatbots as useful tools for facilitating ELF communication. Second, as indicated by Lee and Jeon (2023), teacher education programs could incorporate the GELT perspective into CALL courses, adopting a pluricentric English view. Finally, this study proposes the CA-GELT approach to increase GE awareness among students and teachers. As Rose et al. (2021) noted, earlier research used technology mainly as a medium for ELF communication, not as a direct pedagogical intervention for GE awareness. To bridge this gap, advanced technologies such as AI chatbots, generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, or DALL-E3), virtual reality, and the metaverse can be utilized for GE research (Jeon et al., 2023).

# CONCLUSION

This study investigated the effects of AI chatbots in metaverse environments on pre-service English teachers' GE awareness. The quantitative analysis demonstrated that both the presentation and AI chatbot tasks effectively increased their GE awareness, with the AI chatbot task showing a greater impact on their ELF confidence and intentions. Interviews further highlighted that AI chatbots provided ELF interaction opportunities, authentic communication settings, and affective support. Based on these findings, we propose the CA-GELT approach, blending CALL research with GELT principles, focusing on: (1) inte grating GELT into CALL research and (2) using technology to boost GE awareness.

Despite its findings, this study has some limitations. First, due to technical constraints during data collection, we adopted the WoZ method for managing AI virtual agents, mirroring five English speakers from diverse L1 backgrounds. However, as this method is criticized for using a proxy for a human user rather than an actual AI system (Riek, 2012), future research could utilize AI chatbots that embody human speakers' linguistic, cultural, and identity backgrounds through advanced NLP technology (Zhang & Lin, 2022). Moreover, we identified a resource shortfall for adequately supporting participants' interactions with AI chatbots under WoZ. For instance, we could not offer a tutoring system that would enable the participants to effectively learn to control their avatars in 3D space. Finally, our selection of five Englishes from three circles for WE exposure and ELF interaction might suggest that global English usage aligns with distinct English varieties. While the WE approach aids in raising awareness of

English diversity (Galloway & Rose, 2015, 2018), the concept of variety is problematic when addressing how English functions as ELF in global contexts (Jenkins, 2015). Therefore, follow-up studies might emphasize more fluid ELF interactions in technology-assisted GE courses, supporting fluid English usage across diverse authentic situations (Rose et al., 2019).
