# BALEAP news - Introduction to SIGs: Meet TELSIG, the Technology Enhanced Learning SIG

# Background

The SIG was established on 10th February 2020 after a successful proposal made by Panagiota Tzanni to create a technologyfocused special interest BALEAP group.

The BALEAP Technology Enhanced Learning Special Interest Group (TELSIG) focuses on the integration of technology and pedagogy in the field of EAP. The Technology Enhanced Learning SIG aims to promote the use of technology in the EAP classroom and advocates for practices that benefit both students and teachers.

TELSIG centres its efforts on the intersection of technology and pedagogy in the field of EAP. Its objectives include developing interest in technology use among its membership and the broader EAP community, providing a platform for exploration, collaboration, and discussion of technology in EAP learning and teaching, and sharing expertise and research to meet the evolving needs of EAP practitioners with an interest in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL).

# Development

At the inception of the SIG, a committee was formed, comprising the Convenor, Secretary, Treasurer, Events Coordinator, Social Media Coordinator, and Web Coordinator, totalling five members. In 2021, the positions were officially ratified, marking the formal establishment of the committee. Panagiota Tzanni, the SIG's founder, assumed the role of Convenor, while Craig Coulson became the Secretary, Celia Antoniou took on the dual responsibilities of Treasurer and Social Media Coordinator, and Jolanta Hudson assumed the roles of Events and Web Coordinator.

As the SIG gained popularity and leading to an increase in responsibilities and workload, our team naturally expanded. We created new committee member roles: Ordinary members, focusing specifically on Editing or Events.

The ordinary member with a focus on editing was taken on by Craig Coulson, who had stepped down from his role as the SIG Secretary in 2021. Simultaneously, in 2022, a new Events coordinator, Deanne Cobb-Zygadlo, joined the team, taking over from Jolanta Hudson who, following the departure of Panagiota Tzanni, became the SIG Convenor (while maintaining her position as the Web Coordinator). In 2022, we also welcomed a new Ordinary member specialising in Events, Phil Martin, who later, in 2023, moved to the role of Events Co-coordinator to aid in the planning and organisation of events. Earlier this year, Jonathan Smith took the position of the Ordinary member with a focus on Events. With the Secretary position being vacant since 2022, the committee shares administrative duties and will do so until a new Secretary is appointed.

In addition, our SIG members who, while not holding formal responsibilities, are invited to our annual AGM meetings and actively participate in discussions on our SIG forum via the University of Glasgow MS Teams platform. As of October 17, 2023, our SIG has grown to include 212 EAP practitioners.

The committee convenes approximately once a month to discuss TELSIG matters and plan future projects. We foster collaboration by utilising a shared folder on the University of Glasgow SharePoint where the SIG's documents are stored and managed.

We have developed our website, https://telsig.baleap.org, utilising the Google Sites template. Here, we consistently publish th latest information on our activities, share recordings and details from our webinars and events, and communicate any changes to ou SIG. The website undergoes regular updates to keep our members well informed.

In addition, we share our updates, projects and activities through our social media channels: X, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram.

# Events and activities

Our monthly webinars and Coffee Talks have seen excellent participation, typically ranging from between 40 and 60 attendees. To streamline our event processes, we have appointed a second Events coordinator. To date, we have organised and hosted 26 webinars which can be accessed via our YouTube channel. All webinars take place online via Zoom, providing a platform for EAP practitioners globally to share their expertise and research in teaching EAP with technology.

Initially, our events were organised through the TELSIG Eventbrite account, providing attendees the convenience of booking in advance. However, due to added fees associated with organising events on this platform, the SIG has recently transitioned to Ticket Tailor, a free events platform. Our TELSIG calendar of events is readily accessible on the website, providing live updates.

Notably, considering different time zones when scheduling our events encouraged consistent participation from our international members. The Coffee Talk sessions provide valuable opportunities for our membership and the wider BALEAP community to engage in discussions centred around utilising technology in the EAP classroom.

Current and former committee members actively contribute to webinars, generously sharing insights with both BALEAP and the global community. In one instance, Panagiota Tzanni collaborated with Lauren Knowles from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, delivering a two-part talk addressing real-world challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic in adapting EAP courses online. The discussion covered key decisions in transitioning lessons online and explored useful web tools for online practice (Knowles & Tzanni, 2020).

Celia Antoniou followed suit (Antoniou, 2020), sharing her experiences and perspectives on navigating EAP online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed by another insightful webinar on peer feedback in the online EAP class by Tzanni (2020).

Continuing the engaging webinar series, Craig Coulson, along with Laurence Kinsella from Nazarbayev University, presented a webinar discussing enhancing online writing at Nazarbayev University (Coulson & Kinsella, 2020). Jolanta Hudson also contributed to the series, along with her colleague Neil Allison from the University of Glasgow discussing the practical applications of Microsoft Teams and OneNote in the EAP classroom (Allison & Hudson, 2020).

Wrapping up the year 2020, Panagiota Tzanni invited Scott Thornbury to explore digitized DOGME for EAP at the SIG webina (Thornbury & Tzanni, 2020).

In 2022, Jonathan Smith engaged the audience with a webinar on promoting academic integrity in online language learning for EAP (Smith, 2022).

In addition to webinars, we ran our inaugural BALEAP TEL SIG conference, titled ‘Technology-Enhanced Learning and EAP in the post-COVID-19 era'. The conference was hosted online on 3 and 4 October 2020. With 14 speakers presenting, the conference aimed to address four key technology-related objectives. Firstly, it sought to gain insights into how EAP course leaders had responded to the challenge of transitioning EAP course delivery to an online format. Additionally, the conference aimed to understand the impact of this new method of delivery on both EAP students and teachers. It further investigated the evolving nature and dynamics of EAP teaching and learning in the context of technological advancements. Lastly, the conference aimed to explore and discuss the future role of technology in the field of EAP.

Our current Events Co-Coordinator, Phil Martin, delivered a compelling talk (Martin, 2020) at the conference discussing the role of e-learning authoring tools in enhancing flipped learning environments.

It is noteworthy that, amid a distinguished gathering of experienced EAP professionals, esteemed industry authorities such as Nick Peachey, who presented a compelling talk on ‘Creating Rapport in the Remote Classroom' (Peachey, 2020), and David Read, who shared insights on ‘The Reality of Building A Sustainable Technology Team' (Read, 2020a, 2020b), were prominent speakers at the conference.

# External engagements

The BALEAP Biennial Conference 2021, themed ‘Exploring Pedagogical Approaches in EAP Teaching,' was hosted online from April 6–10, 2021, by English for Academic Study at the University of Glasgow; at the conference, the TELSIG committee organised and hosted a dedicated session. The event featured an introduction to the SIG and its committee members, a practical workshop, and a round-table discussion with a panel of EAP experts (Antoniou et al., 2021).

The session started with a one-hour practical workshop led by Celia Antoniou and chaired by Craig Coulson. The focus was on introducing EAP teacher-research and guiding participants on starting their own EAP online classroom-based research projects.

The second part of the event included a round-table discussion with guest speakers David Read (University of Sheffield) and Fiona Wallace (University College London) chaired by the TELSIG committee. The discussion centred around how the ongoing pandemic and the shift to online teaching have influenced our approaches to learning and teaching EAP with technology.

At the recent BALEAP conference in Warwick in April 2023, our SIG played an active role by contributing to a Community Open Practice session on Technology Enhanced Learning in materials development. During the SIGs Fayre, our Events Coordinator, Phil Martin, along with David Anderson from the University of York, hosted a session exploring practical strategies and examples of online teaching materials developed at York (Anderson & Martin, 2023).

# Impact

Our social media presence has been increasing as a result of the success and popularity of our events. Our Twitter account current has a total of 890 followers, our Facebook group has 723 members, our LinkedIn account is followed by a circle of 630 active professionals and our Instagram has 350 followers.

All our events are hosted on our YouTube channel, which currently hosts a total of 40 recorded conference presentations and webinars with 353 subscribers.

The inaugural BALEAP TELSIG conference provided a platform to share best practice and reflect on the pivotal role technology played in overcoming the challenges we all faced during the pandemic.

The BALEAP Technology Enhanced Learning Special Interest Group (TELSIG) has significantly impacted the BALEAP community and EAP professionals. Through regular meetings, collaborative efforts, and well-attended webinars and Coffee Talks, TELSIG has created a vibrant platform for global engagement. The strategic appointment of an additional Events Coordinator has also enabled enhanced event organisation. We have had the privilege of hosting esteemed industry authorities. TELSIG's commitment to inclusivity is evident in its diversity of members and contributors from across the world, further solidifying its role as a dynamic hub for TEL in EAP.

# Future plans

In 2024, TELSIG looks forward to hosting its second Online Conference, providing a collaborative space for EAP professionals eager to enhance their lessons with digital tools and online learning platforms. This event aims to facilitate the sharing of innovative ideas and projects in EAP.

To further engage our community, we plan to continue offering webinars, possibly transitioning to a 6-week cycle until additional resources allow for more frequent events. Additionally, we aspire to introduce a seminar series addressing emerging issues, such as the role of AI in EAP.

Innovating our format, we are considering adding podcasts, alternating with webinars for varied content delivery. Furthermore, we are keen on exploring more interactive platforms for hosting Coffee Talks to ensure dynamic and engaging discussions within our community.
