A central part of academic practice is to generate knowledge and to communicate it, in interaction with peers (refining the knowledge) and with the wider public (building legitimacy in society). For this reason, communication of academic knowledge has been an important object of applied linguistic studies over many years. Central to this work is it to generate knowledge about the details of academic knowledge communication in order to teach the most central aspects to upcoming researchers.

The book under review takes this applied linguistics approach. It presents insights into the practice of academic knowledge communication to make it ccesible for other researchers. The book's main raisond etr is that the emergence of the World Wide Web and the host of ensuing genres with different purposes and audiences has changed the practice, making it relevant to reconsider existing insights from the study of communication in more traditional media and concentrate upon research into digital academic knowledge communication. Furthermore, it presents examples of practically relevant genres and subgenres emerging from the digital setting. The boo thus ffers understandings of resarch into these rhetorical sitations, taking n explanatory as well as a didacti and in a few instances even a normative aproach. Importantly, although the book presents some new analyes in the analytical part of the chapters, it is not a monograph demonstrating the authors' new insights into this field of communication. Instead, it is a timely overview of the state of the art of relevant research with examples of how to carry out such analyses.

The volume consists of three major parts. Chapters 1-3 present the focus of the study and elaborate on the conceptual framework that is suggested as relevant: (digital) genre as main descriptive tool and knowledge communication as the studied practice). The largest part of the book (sections 4-10) present different types of online academic knowledge communication. Each chapter begins with an overview of rearch into genres of the respective type of communication, followed by a more elaborate analysis of one genre. As a final part, the last chapter presents desired future research.

Concerning the chosen genre approach, the authors draw on two related approaches both oriented towards text production but derived from diferent basic assumptions: The genre approach of Englis for Specific Purposes (ESP approach) and the genre approach of Rhetorical Genre Studies (RGS approach). Where the ESP approach has it focus on recurrent communicative purposes underlying the text production, the RGS aroach takes abroader rhetorical perspective, focusing more on genres as socially greed solutions to recurrent communicative challenges. The authors prefer the RGS approach in their analyses as it does not have as narrow a focus on communicative purpose and intended audience as the ESP approach and thus may beter grasp the situational aspects in the digital setting. A central aspect of digital genres elaborated in chapter 2 is exactly that the concept of audience and thus of specific purpose tends to break down in the digital setting, due to the wide accessility of online digital texts. It would be possible to work with preferred and neglectable possble audiences in an ESP genre approach, and the authorsalso do not exclude ESP results in their overviews or own analyses. However, I agre that by opting for the RGS as the dominant approach in their own analyses, they get access to the wider analytical instruments of rhetoric, which is an asset for the insights of the book.

The general design of the genre investigations in the chapters 4-10 is to depart from situational factors of digital academic knowledge communication (especiall that they are situated online and performed under the influence of the ideal of open science and of English as a dominant lnguage choice) and then to focus on the rhetorical functions to be carried out under these situational circumstances. The following overall topics are treated: identity construction (ch. 4), interaction with other researchers (ch. 5, 6, 10), and interaction with the wider public (ch. 7, 8, 9). Each chapter focuses on one genre, which is investigated in more detai, but other genres relevant for the topic are also considered in the introductory overview. Examples of focused genres are blogs, academic social networks, open peer review blogs, and online popular science videos, to name a few. To achieve coherence between the chapters, two aspects are discussed generall in chapter 3 and then taken up in the genre analyses in the chapters 4-10: First, the influence and exploitation of the afordances of the online medium, especially web 2.0, on the development of generic patterns; and secondly the choice of language between English and local languages.

The focus on theaffordances is in accordance with choosing the RGs approach as primary analytical method, as i is apt for enabling descriptions, explanations, and evaluations ofthe emergence of new and modernization of traditional nres. For instance, in chapter 4 on identity construction they present an analysis of 12 Spanish research groups blog practice and demonstrate that blogs as igital and interactive genres are specifically apt for presenting groups as competent and internationally networked researchers with interest in being civic scientists, for instance through linking and multimodality. In chapter 5, the authors present a new analysis of online laboratory notes and demonstrate that the moves and posts reflect the dynamics f texts of this new genre (which, as the authors also indicate, depart from a traditional local genre, but exploits theaffordances of the new medium). And in chapter 6, the authors present an analysis of ResearchGate as an academic social network. Here, they describe how the afordance of the medium (web 2.0) allows for informal research communication that build interpersonal relations (bonding and support purposes) as wellas allow for advice seeking and advice giving in a non-face-threatening way.

Due to this analytical choice, the degree to which the patterns are tabilized plays a central role in the descriptions. The authors venture to predict whether the new genres have  good possibilit of surviving. Thus, they give at least a rudimentary shot at a theory of generic development in the field, although theory development does not seem to be the central intent of the book. Such genres are given the best chance of surviving which actually carry out functions inherent of academic knowledge communication. An example of that is the video methods article treated in chapter 9.2.2. Genres, on the other hand, that take advantage of the affordances of the online medium for achieving better relations with the general public are given a lesser chance of stability and survival. An analysed example is the popularising video abstract treated in chapter 9.2.1. The authors argue convincingly that tis function is probably best carried out through experiments with formats and elements, due to the necessity of an innovative air, like in other advertising genres. So, stability of patterns is less likely to emerge in this type of rhetorical situation.

The second recurrent focus is the choice of language, touching especially upon the relational more than the centrll research. oriented aspects of the rhetorical situation. The choice between using the always present English or the local language of the researcher is constantly imminent in the practice of researchers with English as an additional language, what however tends to go undiscussed in scientific practice, as the choice of Global English seems so natural' In fact, the authors demonstrate that the affor dances of the digital medium rather enable than prevents the choice of including other languages than English. For instance, the analysis in chapter 7 of Spanish research groups' practice of communicating with a wider audience on Twiter shows that they strategically choose between languages (and other semiotic resources) acording to purpose and intended audience when communicating. And in chapter 8, research is referred that shows that when communicating with a supporting public via online platforms researchers take advantage of choosing relevant languages and even repeat information in different languages, also dependent upon situational and political requirements. So, the affordance of the medium, viz., the possility of offering users a choice between language versios f for instance video abstracts and thus enabling rapport building to different groups of users, i highlighted here as an opportunity to escape from some of the downsides of neglecting other languages than English. This is one of the places where the authors leave the rather objective direction of applied linguistics and take a normative and critical position on the development.

I see the book as a highly valuable advanced introduction to research into digital academic knowledge communication. It is a textbook in its design, but not one of teaching the practice. Practitioners willhave a hard time finding practical advice for text production, whers students and reearchers get an insightful oveview of the central aspts of the rhetorical situations underlying such communication. Hence, the book is especially well suited for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as researchers with interest in an overview of research into academic knowledge communication in English as wellas in other languages. This is especially due to the fact that it covers possile rech ject in the form f ifferent res and speific hrical function as well as a wide range of research results and methods suitable for studying these genres from the point of view of central topics defining this type of communication like open science, popularisation of knowledge, and choice of language.
