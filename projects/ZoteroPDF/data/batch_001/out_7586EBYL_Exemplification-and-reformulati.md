Exemplification and reformulation are key elaborative strategies that empower clarity and argumentation in academic writing. Most research investigating their use in academic writing argues that writers' choices in terms of frequency and marker type are conditioned by disciplinary variations and the level of expertise of the writers. This has led to an understanding of discourse communities as being homogeneous groups of novice versus expert writers and of separate soft versus hard disciplines. Through the analysis of 90 research articles and book chapters single. authored by six leading linguists, this study shows that these successful authors deviate from the common practices in linguistics and their choices deviate from each other significantly. However, the data does not reveal any steady increasing or decreasing frequencies in the use of exemplification and reformulation throughout their career stages, which makes it hard to claim that the frequency of using the two discourse functions evolves with experience. The study argues that individuality and style preferences within the same discourse community should be acknowledged as an additional variable affecting discursive choices and calls for a more nuanced understanding of disciplinarity and writing expertise.

# 1. Introduction

Producing successful academic texts i often the outcome of several intervening conceptual and discursive variables some of which directly relate to scholarly clarity and rigour. Exemplification and reformulation are often considered two discourse functions that fruitflly contribute to the success of the produced texts. The value of these functions is their ability to render abstract incomprehensible ideas, concepts and arguments intoclear and convincing prose, which explains their permanent use in all types of academic discourse in its oral and writte forms. In various discourse aroaches, they are often grouped together as elaborative discourse tools (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Thompson, 2014; Triki, 2014, 2017), a forms of metadiscourse serving writer-reader interactive purposes (Hyland, 2005a), as markers of discourse reflexivity (Mauranen, 1993; Adel, 2006), or simply as syntactic and semantic appositives (Meyer, 1992; Quirk et al, 1985). Other studies take a discourse marker approach and focus on the lexicalisation and grammaticalization properties of the words and expressions signalling instances of exemplification or rformulation such as for example and i other words (.g., Del Saz, 2003; Fraser, 199). With the wide spread of metadiscourse studies in discourse approaches, there has been an increasing number of studies that explore the use of exemplification and reformulation in academic discourse either as part of the package forming the interactional model (Hyland, 2005a) or as the sole focus of investigating what is commonly referred to as code glosses (e.g., Bondi, 2020; Guziurova, 2020; Hyland, 2007; Su e l., 2022; Triki, 2021). The insights of such studes stem from their comparative dimensions wherey exemplification and reformulation choices are studied either separately or in combination across disciplinary practices or across novice and expert academic texts, highlighting how disciplinarity and expertise can affect writers' choices.

Those disciplinary approaches to code glosses seem to be inherently driven by two assumptions. The first implicitly acknowledges the hegemony of disciplinary voice over the personal one (Hyland, 2007, 2012a), meaning that writers' choices to use first person pronouns, to mitigate or boost the weight of their claims or express personal attitudes are driven and conditioned by practices in the field. The resulting efect is that texs within the same discipline are considered as homogeneous groups rather than single points that can vary considerably. The second assumption positions writers along a cline of expertise where student writing is oten contrasted to more advaned forms f writing, spficall, rerch article writing (RA) (Hyland, 2005b, 2020). This view situate student gres e. g, undergraduate essays, MA and PhD disertations) at one extremity and the RA genre at the opposite side making i the norm to be followed. The move on the cline i unidirectional, i., from the novice to the advanced, a proces through which authors internalise and master disciplinary identities imposed by their communities of practice until they reach the expert position. Again, we end up with a distorted picture of reality where the individual authorial voices of each single author are supresed and where novice and expert writers are understood as distinct groups marked by the lack of writing expertise in the texs produced at their intial academic careers as opposed to the acknowledged expertise their texts gain when they start producing RAs. Surprisingly, despite the extant literature on academic writing and on the us f intractive featres in discourse, t rmains unclr why elaborative discourse functions are used y the same author throughout the derent phase of their career progres and whether the most uccessful aamics use thee functions similarly compared to other academics in the discipline. This study wil try to address this gap by looking at the writings of six renowned linguists.

It is now established as a fact that the contexts of culture (genre) and the context of stuation (register) are the main variables affecting linguistic choices in texs, such that texts sharing the same contexts would display very similar frequencies of usef the same linguistic and rhetorical features. In addition, if we trust Hyland's (2007: 283) concusion that the frequency of code glosses parallels disciplinary routines in argumentation we would expect that the most suesful and widely acknowledged linguists would stand out in their elaborative and argumentative skill, skills that are partly favoured by their mastery of exemplification and reformulation techniques. However, since the individuals who produce these texts diffr socio-culturally (regional variation, academic practces, career paths) and perhaps also linguisiclly (L1 versus English L2 users, it is expected that individual authorial preferences would e reflectd in the texts of those authors. To account for individuality in writing, this study explores authorial choices of exemplification and reformulation in a sample of RAs and book chapters single authored by six distinguished lingusts and compares their frequencies to the common practices in comparable studies. A qualitative analysis of some observed stylistic preferences will substantiate the quantitatie findings to further eplain the syndromes of individuality in the corpus. The implication of the study resides in how it can shape our understanding of elaborative discourse functions and how they can be conditioned not only by disciplinary cultural norms but also by idiosyncratic individual preferences.

# 2. Exemplification and reformulation as elaborative discourse functions

The ability to present arguments persuasively and efectively is crucial for scholars to make an impact in their fields. Leading scholars ofen employ rhetorical techniques, logical reasoning, and evidence-based arguments to convince readers of the validity and significance of their research. Their writing style helps them efectively communicate their ideas, gain recognition, and shape the discourse within their disciplines. Previous studies have argued for the massive role played by exemplification and reformulation and their contribution in achieving clarit, coherence, accessbility, rigour, precision, persuasiveness, and effective argumentation in scholarly writing (Blakemore, 1993; Hlliday & Mathiese, 2014; Hyland, 2007; Triki, 2017). Exemplification and reformulation are often considered two discourse functions that fulfil very similar goals in language despite the fact that they score as one of the least frequent types of interactional metadiscourse in academic papers (Hyland & Jiang, 2018). A main diffrence between the two discourse functions lies in their logical construction. While reformulating segments are related via equivalence relations to the reformulated ones and are, accordingly, very close in meaning to definitions, exemplifying ones are rather tied via metoymic relations where the exemplifying structure could be thought of as a member in the larger class of the exemplifying chunk (Triki, 2019). In various discourse approaches, they are often grouped together as elaborative and cohesive discourse tools in SFL (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Thompson, 2014), as forms of code glosses (Hyland, 2005a, 2007; Mauranen, 1993; Adel, 2006) or simply as syntactic and semantic appositive relations between the constituents (Meyer, 1992; Quirk et al., 1985). Arguably, under these umbrellaterms, ther similar dicourse functions may fll, a in elaborating clarfications within SFL or reformulating deinitions in metadiscourse studies.

Exemplification involves providing concrete examples or cases to support and illstrate abstract concepts or arguments. By including relevant examples, leading cholars can make their ideas more tangible and relatable to readers. This helps enhance clarity and accessbility whil bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world aplications (Triki, 2021). Examples provide readers and listeners either with concrete instances that they can understand and relate to or, sometimes, may come in the shape of invented or hypothetical scenarios (Nesi & Alsop, 2021). Their ultimate goals would be to elucidate and facilitate comprehension and to make arguments more persuasive (Su et al., 202; Younis e al., 2023). Reformulation, on the other hand, reers to the restatment or rewording of an idea or argument in a different way using altenative equivalent words, phrase, or sentence structure. By restating or rephrasing complex ideas, scholars can clarify their intended meaning, avoid ambiguity, and provide multiple perspectives on a concept. Hyland (2007) clasifies reformulations based on their expanding or reducing functional properties. Under expansion, he argues that explanations and implications widen up writers intended meaning and guide the readers towards a specific understanding With reductive types, instances of paraphrase and spcfication help generat the gist of an utterance or highlight one of is specific properties. Such a clasification was previously criticised for being somehow confusing and for including definitions, a discourse function inherently distinct in its structural, semantic and pragmatic aspects (Triki, 2019, p. 107).

# 3. Genre, register and style features in academic discourse

The main concern in previous studies on exemplification and reformulation have focused on how they are used within and across various types of genres, registers, academic writing expertise, professional and social settings as well as languages. For example, Guziurova (2022) compared novice L2 master's these aross three disciplines (linguistics iterature and ELT methodology) to expert writers' RAs. Her results showed that code glosses were higher in the master's theses, that exemplification predominated over reformulation and that the highest frequencies were found in linguistics and the lowest in literature. Likewise, Su & Ye, 2023 found that MA and PhD EFL writers use exemplification similarly but may have diffrent preferences for the marker choice and for the constituent patterns of exemplification acts. In oral academic genres such as 3-min presentations (Liu et a. 2023), exemplifications, reformulations and definitions are deployed to render technical scientific knowledge accessible to non-specialist audiences and are therefore considered fundamental tols in science popularisation. Molino's (2018) study showed that reformulation was quite frequent in teachers lectures in English Medium Instruction contexts, ut its use semed conceptuall different from its common functions in other academic settings. The deviation was explained by teachers' hesitation and their constant need to restate out of uncertainty rather than to guarantee better understanding for the students. The common denominator between these studies is their reliance on external variables such as genre and discilin to explain the similaritie and variations, with ittleor no acknowledgement of internal or personal markers of individuality.

Using apposition isacharacteristic of good writers (Macken-Horarik, 2006, p. 114) which makes clarity, coherence and concision rank in the top style elements agred upon in academic style guides (Sword, 2012, p. 26). Much of the research on identity is centred around the notion of disciplinary identity, defined mostly as being "discoursally constructed (Thompson & Hunston, 2020, p.6) It is divided into aspects of academic writing that follow the mainstream conventions in the discipline and those that demarcate the \*enabling conditions for individuality (Hyland, 2012a, p. 35). This approach to academic identity was reproduced in several studes, specificll the one dopting gnre and eistr ersectie. Peronal entties and athorial voce cn bely dected in es rigid forms of text genres like personal webpages and blogs (Hyland, 2011, 2012b; Kirkup, 2010 or through the analysis of the transparent authorial presence in texts like the use of personal pronouns .g., Wang & Hu, 2023), atitude markers, hedges and boosers (Gillerts & Van de Velde, 2010), and citation practices (Hewings et al., 2010). Hang and Hyland (2019), for example, restricted their study to the interpersonal language choices made by the same authors moving between blog posts and RAs, implying that, perhaps, variation between the texts would be sensitive to genre and communicative purposes without considering the possble influence of authorial preferences.

Studies on explicit authorial presence through self-mention in linguistics RAs point towards a decreasing tendency in using frst pronouns (Hyland & Jiang, 2018; Wang & Hu, 2023). However, as argued for by Ivanic (1998: 331), authorial voice can also be reflecte in the orts of words that the writer fees comfortable using' This understanding i acknowledged in relevance theory where reformulation is considered as "a decision about style, which like all decisions about style, is constrained by the search for relevance" (Blakemore, 1993, p. 119). Discourse markers of style may be more significant in expert academics writings and their efect on the community could be decisive in shaping the conventions within the field. Duszak's (1997: 26) thoughts summarise the link between expert writing and style preferences:

It seems that expertise standards are negotiable among more competent members of the communit, and that attributed levels of expertise are correlates of ones scope of readership. On the other hand, widely recognised experts may take the liberty to diverge from standardized patters in academic communication. [..] an expert turns into an authorit, and then may develop an idiosyncratic stle of writing that is not to be imitated or criticized for its violations of academic standards.

Such a statement sugests that expert writers can deviat from the mainstream practice in their fields, however, it nether explains Whether those deviations happen only when the author becomes an expert nor when they happen exactly. Part of this study wil try to track the extent to which features of elaboration in discourse change along the path towards expertise and willsuggest that the trajectories are not necessarily linear.

# 4. Methodology

# 4.1. Corpus selection

Exploring the writing style of a single author implie collecting different written texts over a period of time long enough to enable a scrutiny of the evolution process from the early stages of writing to the later ones. In science and academia, carving one's name can either take place through break through theories and findings or through an extensive number of publications over the years. For this reason, the best candidate authors were thought to be senior academics who have published a large number of texts throughout their areers. In addition, the notoriet of those writers and their potential impact on the disciplinary community could influence peers and novice researchers in their field. Keeping these ideas in mind, I have collected a corpus of 90 single-authored RAs $\left( \mathtt { n } = 6 9 \right)$ and book chapters $\mathbf { ( n = 2 1 }$ ) totalling over 870,o00 words (Table 1). These texts were authored by six preeminent scholars who have made significant contributions to various felds of inguisics. ach scholar i rresented by 15 texts from their initial, middle and late career publication perios. Admitedly, the limited number f texts representing each period may not full reflect the writing habits of each author, yet the choice was imposed by the fact that most authors have more co-authored publications than single ones. Moreover, the mixture of RAs and book chapters was a necessty rather than a choice as i allowed the compilation of the necessary number of publications per author and per career phase.

The selection processof the top-ranking authors was based on three objective criteria. Firstly, I relied on authors cittion scores on Google Scholar to identify the top 30 most cited lingusts in 2022(oannidis, 2022, p. V5). Citation scores, as suggested by Teplitskiy et al. (2022), atract substantive readings and shape the attention given to specific texts, making the choice of the papers to read conditioned by the high citation number of those papers. Teplitskiy e al.'s findings also suggest an association betwen citation score and quality reputation of the authors. Yet it was felt that high citation scores alone were not enough to selec the authors. The second criterion was the number f publications by the same author which was set to a minimum of 120 publications encompassing RAs, book chapters, books, and other scholarly works. Lastly, the inclusion of authors with publications spanning at least 20 years, even if the standard is a ten-year rule (Dressen-Hammouda, 2014; Ericsson, 2006), ensured a rich and extensive body of work to compare po. tential variabilit in authorial choices as they gain experience and recognition. From the ist of the top 30 cited inguists in 2022, the authors who met these criteria were Ken Hyland, Rod Elli, Teun A. Van Dijk, Suresh Canagarajah, Douglas Biber and Ray Jackendoff.

These linguists texts cover diverse subfields such as language teaching and learning, cognitive linguistics, discourse analysis, corpus inguistics, EAP and ESP. The texts selected also apply diffrent methodological approaches (quantitative, qualitative and conceptual or theoretical approaches), variables that can affct lexico-grammatical and rhetorical choices (Gray, 2015). The length of careers extends over diffrent spans, with the shortest being Canagarajah's (29 years) and the longest being Van Dijk's (53 years). As such, the early periods for Hyland and Canagarajah date back to the early 1990s Ellis and Bibersis the early 1980s while Jackendoff and Van Dijk's early phases refer to the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. The late periods include publications in the last five to seven years (2017-2022) except for Biber and Jackendoff(text from 2013 to 2019). The middle period of each author corresponds to their publications around their mid-career. This means that the thee stages, especially the early and middle ones, span over different time periods. The interval between early-midde and middle-late also varies within the same author mainly because most of the other publications were not single authored.

# 4.2. Methods

The corpus was automatically searched for the most productive exemplification and reformulation markers using AntConc (An thony, 2020). The search list was based on the markers that were reeatedly cited in the literature as the ones that would capture most of the occurrences f the two discourse functions (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Hyland, 2005a, 2007; Quirk et al., 1985; Su et al., 2022; Triki, 2021). Marker (e., to mention  few, ut iffeny, to ut anthr way wee not incudd in the finl sch list buse they were not present in the whole corpus or resulted in 1 or 2 hits only. The final list includes ten items for exemplification (as in, e.g, xample (f), for pl f ine, de ik, suc s, itt, s) an ne frtio l, e  thr wd in particular, or, prticularly, that is (to say), this/which mean(s), namely). This list excludes alldefintional search terms that are often included in the identification of code gloses. Following Murillo (2012), Triki (2019), Barabadi e l. (2021) and Liu et al. (2023), I adopt a narrower understanding of reformulation that excludes defintional meanings. This is an important remark because it will affect how quantitative results should be understood, and most importantly, how the comparisons with similar results i the literature should be perceived in the results sections. Rayson's log-likelihood tests were alied to measure the significance f the differenes.

While most of the markers had a straightorward meaning and would either signal an instance of exemplification or a reformu. lation, some specific ones needed manual checking to discard all usages that were irrelevant. In partcular, the markers like and or needed special attention. In wrtten academic prose, like could be used as a marker of comparison or as an exemplifier. Despite ther similarities, exemplification and comparison functions are distinct. The former involves providing illstrations that support and clarify ageneral tatement, arment or concept. The atte, howeer, highlighs similarities and/r differnces between two or more entities, ideas, or phenomena, elucidating the characteristics, qualities, or relationships between the compared elements. For instance, in example 1, Jackendoff aims at highlighting the similarities between pronominalization and VP-Deletion; in 2, however, Biber provides an illustrative instance of what is meant by made-up dialogues.

1. Like pronomindlization, VP-Deletion can (at least sometimes) delete the left-hand verb phrase if i is in a subordinate clause. (Jackendoff-Early)   
2. This belief is sometimes refected in the overly frequent use of progressive verbs in made-up dialogs (like those found in ESL/EFL coursebooks teaching conversation skills). (Biber-Middle)

I used a simple test that proved helpful in deciding whether the function is primarily compare or exemplify. By looking for the closest agnate, if like could be replaced by such as it was considered exemplifying but if i i interchangeable with similar to it was considered comparative and therefore discarded from the concordance lines. Thus, in the two previous examples, only 2 was considered exemplifying.

Likewise, or is not always used to introduce elaborating alternative expressions of the form $\mathbf { \widetilde { X } }$ is y). Sometimes, it signals a choice between two entitie (either x or y), in which case, it does not evoke reformulation meanings. As illustrated in 3, govenments and the general public are not equivalent to each other and or simply means and. In 4, however, the words Aims and Goals are synonymous and can be used interchangeably. Thus, or is considered reformulating only in examples like 4.

3. To make their claims known to governments or the general public social movements nee to engage in many forms of text and alk (Van Dijk-Late)   
4. The very keyword mission may be the very name of the next category, and more generall refersto the name of the Ams or Goals of a/this movement. (Van Dijk-Late)

Another vital feature I considered while analysing elaboration acts is the boundaries of the unit being elaborated, the marker or signal used and the elaborating unit. This helped identify the kind of structural and semantic link tying the units together and gave a better understanding of whether the choice of the marker could also be conditioned by the structural and semantic properties of the elaborated units. Thus, ll examples extracted from the orpus will include the unit being exemplified or reformulated (i itlics,the marker (in bold), and the unit exemplifying or reformulating (underlined).

# 5. Findings and discussion

# 5.1. Exemplification and reformulation in the leading linguists' corpus

The general findings of appositive exemplifying and reformulating units explicitl inroduced in the corpus confirm the recurrence of these functions in academic writing with a considerable higher density (more than 82 per paper) compared to allresults reported so far in the literature. Quantitative results show dominance of exemplification over reformulation, a reult somehow expected as some previous studies demonstrated the same patterns. What is noticeable, however, is the variation in density of these functions in comparable corpora. For example, Hyland's (2007) study, specifically the results of the lingustics section, also found dominance of exemplification over reformulation, yet, with a much lower density (roughly 55 per 10,000 words: Reformulation 21.0 and exemplification 32.0). Su e al's (2022) findings on exemplificatio in linguistics RAs score 23.63 per 10,000 words and les so in the less expert writigs of MA dissertations (19.47). The tendency seems to be different in non-lingustic disciplines. For example, Bondi's (2020) study of exemplification and reformulation in the RAs of two leading economists found that the overall density is $5 2 , 1 9 \mathrm { p e r } 1 0$ 000 words, with reformulation (30,55 density sightl exceeding exemplification (21,64). This is an important observation that marks the specificit of the corpus studied in this paper, which suggests that successul inguists seem to use both types of appositives much more frequently than other linguists and that the dominance of exemplification over reformulation could be sensitive to disciplinary practices rather than genre differences.

Table 2 shows variations in the frequencies of exemplification and reformulation among the six authors. Repetitive comparison of the sum frequencies between the six authors reveals significant differences marking particularly Van Dijk and Canagarajah $( \mathrm { L L = }$ 386.56, $p < 0 . 0 0 \}$ as well as Van Dijk and Ellis $( \mathrm { L L } = 2 3 9 . 4 5 , p < 0 . 0 0 )$ , whereas non-significant variation was found between Biber and Jackendoff and between Hyland and Ellis Van Dijk stands out with the highest density (122.92) that equals more than the double of the last ranking lingust, Canagarajah, suggesting an overall trong presence of the two discourse functions in his corpus. Biber and Jackendoff show relatively high combined exemplification and reformulation frequencies, while Hyland, Ellis, and Canagarajah exhibit lower frequencies. When considering exemplification, Van Dijk maintains the highest density rate (71.59), Biber and Jack. endoff also exhibit relatively comparable high frequencies of exemplification (66.12 and 63.35 respectively). On the other hand, Hyland and Ellis show similar medium frequencies, while Canagarajah ranks last with a low density (29.51) that represents es than half the densities in Van Dijk, Biber and Jackendoff. Turning to reformulation, we can notice that the variation between the authors is less striking. Van Dijk again takes the lead with the highest densit rate (51.32) and a difference of 2.39 points per 10,000 words separating him from the second position taken by Hyland. Canagarajah follows suit with a 28.75 density that almost equals his frequency of exemplification, but which allows him to rank third in reformulation while he ranks last in exemplification. Biber, Jackendoff, and Ellis texts display moderate densitie ranging between 23.43 and 25. These observations highlight authors individual preferences and tendencies and reflect the distinct stlstc choices and rhetorical strategies employed within their respective corpora.

# 5.2. Exemplification and reformulation across career phases

The normalised frequencies of code glosses across the three career stages appear to vary in different ways. As Table 3 shows, Van Dijk has the highest frequency mean, followed by Biber, while Canagarajah ranks last with a mean frequency equalling half of Van Dijk's. The variation in standard deviation (D) indicates the dispersion of those normed frequencies around the mean and reflects how they have changed arosscareer stages. We can notice that Hyland and ls have the lowest SD values, which suggests some stability in their use of the two discourse functions. Biber and Van Dijk have the highest SD values, eflecting more significant changes i their use of code glosses. Canagarajah and Jackendoff on the other hand, lie somewhere in between with relatively similar SD values.

During the middle phase, allauthors increase their use f code glosses, except Hyland whose mid-carr texs include sligtly ower frequencies. These general features, however, do not hold true if we look at exemplification and reformulation separately.

Fig. 1 displays the frequency patterns of using exemplification and reformulation acros the career phases of each author. The more distant the lines are from each other, the more the frequencies of exemplification and reformulation are imbalanced. As the figure shows, exemplification i almost always more frequent than reformulation throughout the three stages with Canagarajah exceptionally using both with very similar frequencies. The lines in the graphs suggest that there is no consistent pattern followed by theauthors nor is there unique ascending or descending trajectories separating the intial, middle and late stages. A chi-square test of goodnes of fit and indepndce Prechr, 2001) pefomed nhe scores of ch uthr acros the th crr tags rels sinficant ifferences $( X ^ { 2 } = 2 9 . 2 5 7$ $P = 0 . 0 0 1 1 3 2 0 7 )$ . Regarding exemplification, Biber, Van Dijk and Ellis exhibit a clear but uneven increase in exemplification frequencies from the early to the middl career stage, followed by a decrease in the late stage where frequencies become similar to the ones in the initial phase. Canagarajah's exemplification use is marked by asteady increase during the middle and late stages. Hyland and Jackendoff move in the opposite direction by reducing the number of examples during their middle stage career, then increasing them towards the late phase. Yet, in the late tage, Hyland's exemplification frequencies become similar to the ones in the initial stage while Jackendof's clearly exceed the ones in the early texts by more than 15 points per 10,000 words. As for reformulation, there is no clear pattern of consistent change in reformulation frequencies across the three career stages for most authors. Ells, Biber and Jackendoffs gaphs indicate an increasing pattern in the middl tage, with the lattr author exhibiting a remarkable increase of more than 12.5 points per 10,00 words. They then relatively maintain the same frequency or slightly lower their use towards the late stage. Van Dijk, Hyland and Canagarajah, on the other hand, slightly lower their use of reformulation to wards the midle phase. During the late stage, Hyland and Canagarajah maintain roughly the same frequencies whereas Van Dijk lowers his use of rformulations by more than 25 points per 10,000 words. In a nutshel, it appears that reformulation is more stable than exemplification. This could be explained by the rhetorical function of ach type. Reformulation is consistently use to reword and explain utterances and idas and also to push argumentatio forward regardes of the nature of the linguistic phenomena investigated. Exemplification, on the other hand, might be more sensitive to the nature of the linguistic phenomenon studied and to the approach paradigms that can change from one publication to another.

The patterns emerging somehow contradict the findings in a comparable diachronic study by Hyland and Jiang (2020) where they found a stedy incrse in the use of code glosses in applied inguistc i thre time periods with average frequencies much lower than the ones reported here. Despite the fact that the time periods in this study vary from one author to the other compared to Hyland and Jiang's study, they can still shed light on the unique stylistic choices made by single authors. These variations indicat that authorial style is dynamic rather than static. It evolves and changes over time but not necessrily in a linear way. The patterns reflect heterogeneous rather than homogeneous trends among the authors, which again diverges from the mainstream practices of other comparable peers choices. However, the fact that there is no consistent pattern orassociation between thedifferent stages does not mean that beginners/novices and experts use appositives similarly. This has een dealt with in several studies where some findings revealed fewer elaborative appositives i student writings (MA or PhD) compared to experts' RAs (Barabadi et l., 2021; Su & Ye, 2023) while others exposing the opposite tendency, i.e, students used more code glosses than experts (Guzirova, 202). The findings here indicate that leading linguists are aware, right from the beginning of their research careers, of the value of appositives and use them very frequently. Moreover, the consistent high frequencies throughout the years may have contributed to the successful carers of the scholars and empowered their writing styles. The findings may also challenge the notion of expertise and how it could be inappropriately perceived as a linear proces evolving in time. Regarding the variations observed between the authors, these could relate to several variables. On the one hand, various research topics, interests and sub-disciplinary fields may require diferent amounts of examples and reformulations to guarantee the desired clarity and persuasiveness. On the other hand, the research design and the methodological apparatuses (Gray, 2015) can also determine the frequencies and nature of the elaborative units. Aditionally, individual writing styes and habit, personal experiences and L1 language backgrounds may as well affect the rhetorical and lexico-grammatical choices made, including the selection of apposition markers.

# 5.3. Exemplification markers

Table 4 illustrates the usage of exemplification markers in the corpus and across the six authors. The findings highlight the dominance of specific markers in introducing exemplification instances. The top three positions are occupied by e.g., such as, and for example, which together introduced more than $5 3 \%$ of all exemplification instances in the corpus. Example of ranks fourth with a frequency similar t for example, while like ranks fith (6.29 occurrences per 10,000 words). Notably, Hyland aligns with the general order found in the corpus for the top three ranking markers. However, Biber and Ells seem to favour for example more frequently than such as. Van Dijk tands out with a preference for example of i the third position, alongside clear preferences for like and for instance. Conversely, Jackendoff and Canagarajah exhibit a dfferent pattern as both authors favour such as in the first position instead of eg., which remains relatively infrequent compared to the other markers (3.19 and 1.34 occurrences per 10,000 words, respectively). Additionally, Jackendof ues like in the second position, which scores the highest frequency in the entire corpus (11.52 occurrences per 10,000 words), while Canagarajah places example of before ike in the third position. Examining the les frequent markers reveals interesting patterns, as some markers are favoured by pecific authors whil being asent or infrequently used by others. For instance, Biber frequently uses ilustrate, which ranks fourth among his choices, while the markers as in and say are more prevalent in Jackendoff' texts but rarely used or absent in the texts of other authors These variations hint towards some personalised choices made by each of the authors.

Fig. 1. Patterns of exemplification and reformulation in the three career stages.

To understand whether such frequencies are unique to those leading authors or whether they represent a general trend in academic writing, we can compare the frequencies to those found in other studies. Comparing the present findings to those of expert writers Who represent peers in the field of linguistics, we can notice that the leading linguists have used e.g. almost twice more than those found in Su et al. (2021) and Guziurova (2022) and $4 5 \%$ more than those reported in Su et al. (2022). The use of such as is also much more frequent in the present corpus as it is about $8 0 \%$ more frequent than the results reported in Su et al. (2021) and about $6 8 \%$ more than those in Su et al. (2022). Likewise, the over-reliance on e.g. and such as resonates in Su et al. (2021) on the evolution of exemplification use in applied linguistics in two time periods. The authors found that e.g. increased considerably, for example decreased and such as increased with statistical significance for the variation in the two time periods.

Despite having a very similar meaning to for example, for instance's use remains rather limited with one exception marking Jackendoff's texts. Strangely, this author uses for instance more than twice his use of the top-ranking marker e.g. In several previous studies, for instance was found to be far les frequent than for example (e.g., Biber et al., 1999; Hyland, 2007; Triki, 2021) and a plausible explanation for this imbalance was given by Rodriguez-Abruneiras, (2017) who suggested that it was "because the noun example isaso more common than the noun instance". Jackendoff, however, seems to use both markers with similar frequencies (6.10 for example and 7.61 for instance).

Looking at the lessfrequent markers, including, ilustrate and say, results reveal some variation across authors with including being favoured by Biber (3.85) and Van Dijk (3.18) where they turn to be more frequent than as in. Likewise, the marker say, which gives the impression that the example is invented or hypothetical, is completely absent from Ellis and Canagarajah's texts but has relatively higher frequencies in Jackendoff and Van Dijk texs. Ilustrate, on the other hand, substantially mark Biber's corpus with a frequency almost as high as his use of such as.

A closer look at how authors use the markers inside their texts also revealed some interesting observations. For example, Biber and Van Dijk turned out to be the ones who over relied on the use of e. more than the other authors. Yet, the way they use them indicates some striking differences as illustrated in examples 5-8.

5. The preposition betwen most commonly occurs s a noun modifier in writte English(e., ifference between, relationship between agreement between), in contrast to the preposition through, which more often has an adverbil function (e.g., go through, passthrough, come through). (Biber-Late)

Example 5 illustrates the common syntactic position of the marker e.g. and how it i often used inside clauses and phrases to introduce expressive examples structured as NPs, PPs, VPs or clauses. This is based on the idea that there are some forms of syntactic collocations where one would expect to find an NP or a clause after a specific linguistic form.

6. Intersentential relations not only are subject t rules for (existential) truth values and for modal and temporal coherence (where e., tense logic will be of importance) ... (Van Dijk-Early)   
7. Alternatively, ideologically based condescension, e.g., with respect to immigrants who do not speak the language well, may be expressed by various forms of simplified foreigner talk. (Van Dijk-Middle)   
8... but thes fous on inuistic anysis, e, of word frquencies or syntactic stucture f entnes, ithout a bodr fous on distinctive properties of the genre. (Van Dijk-Late)

In examples 6-8 from Van Dijk, however, it becomes challnging to immediately identify the exact exemplified units. The reader would expect the marker for example to fit more in those contexts as it is the one that can have the flexibilit which allows it to be inserted inside the exemplifying unit. While e.g and such as definitely come inside the sentence, their position is rather rigid as they immediately precede the exemplifying unit for example and for instance, however, can precede the exemplifying unit, can immediately follow it or can simply be positioned inside i. Such structures were amost exclusively found in Van Dijk's corpus and acros the three stages of his career. Van Dijk uses  as an altenative to for example rathr than an altenative to its closest anate such s. hus, while for the rest of the authors it i often possble to use eg or such as in the same position, in Van Dijk's text, the situation is different because e.g and such as cannot be interchanged.

The marker as in is used to introduce n example thatillustrate a context where meaning or argument/claim can be exhibited and realised. It tends to be fllowed by a number referring to the enumeratio formatting of examples inside a paper, which is acommon practice in linguistic studies. These are situational, often linguistc, settings where the linguists give an ilustrative utterance or structure from texts investigated or from testimonies offered by language users and would refer to them as example $^ +$ number or simply using the number. In rare cases, those exemplars can be referred to as extracts or samples, with the latter being a preferred option in Biber's texts.? The advantage of this exemplification technique is that it allows the exemplifying unit to be referred to multiple times: once in the adjacent context of exemplification and later in more distant places in the paper where the number itself becomes a substitute for the actual example as in 9 where (16) refers to an illstrative language structure used and explained two pages before.

9. What is interesting is that they alow usto formalize a morphological rule like th -al rule asa iece of linguisticstucture containing variables, as in (16). (Jackendoff-Late)

In general, the emerging results indicate that authors do have varied preferences for the exemplification markers they insert in thir texts. Some of them over rely on one or two specific ones, others have a more balanced use of the marker, and a third group selects from a restricted spectrum of choices.

# 5.4. Reformulation markers

The top three reformulation markers identified in the corpus (Table5) are or, i. and that is,collectively constituting aroximately 65 percent of all instances of reformulation in the findings. Among these the reformulator or is used as a top choice by all authors except Ellis, who places it second after ie. The prevalence f or appears particularl prominent in the writings of Van Dijk with a high density of 18.36, and also in the works of Hyland (12.88) and Canagarajah (11.26). Authors exhibit more diversified choices in their second and third most frequent reformulators, both in type and density. For instance, that is ranks second in Van Dijk's texts with a density of 10.68, Biber favours epeciall, yland leans twads this means, while Jackendoff and Ellis show a referce for tht is. he remaining reformulators maintain limited occurrence often representing around or lessthan one instance per ten thousand words. However, some exceptions include partcularly, ranking third in Hylands selections (4.75), and in particular securing the third spot in

Jackendoff's preferences (3.52).

Comparing the findings with the ones found in previous published studies, we can notice huge differences between the leading linguists choices compared to other ones in the same field or in other disciplines. The use of or in Hyland's (2007) corpus represented only $3 . 6 \%$ of all markers in the applied linguistics section, amounted to $^ { 1 3 \% }$ of reformulators in the expert writers' corpus in Kafes (2022) whereas it represents around $3 2 \%$ of the findings in the present study. The marker i.e., on the other hand, was found to be the most frequent reformulator in Hyland (2007) corpus ( $3 0 \%$ of all markers in AL section) followed by that is $( 2 2 . 1 \% )$ while their use by the leading scholars amounts to less than $1 7 \%$ each. In Kafes's corpus, i.e also ranked first representing $1 9 \%$ of all reformulators in the expert writers texts ut was totally absent in the novice writers corpus, whereas the reformulator that i (to say) was more frequently used by novice writers ( $2 3 \%$ versus $2 \%$ in the expert writers). The frequencies of i.e in this study, however, seem to be skewed by the rather unexpected low density in Hyland's texts where only one instance was found. Being the top cited lingust in 20, and the one Who, presumably, studied elaborative markers more than any other scholar, Hyland stands as an outlier in the pool of linguists, confirming the deviation of some leading experts from the general practices in their felds (Duszak, 1997). Bearing in mind that this particular reformulator ranks as the most frequently used marker in linguistics and in other disciplines e.g., Barabadi et al., 2021; Hyland, 2007), the findings strongly suggest an association with the author's own stylisic preferences. In addition, the observed variation from one study to the other proves that the specificities of the texts making thecorpora in each study also affct the patterns of choice. In other words, there is strong indication that the choice of the marker is favoured by authorial choices and style preferences.

Most reformulation instances are used to clarify terms, concepts and sometimes whole ideas by providing syntactically parall structures. In other words, the reformulating unit structure tends to be grammaticlly equivalent to the reformulated unit such that an NP willbe reformulated by an NP as in 10, a PP by a PP in 11, a (non)finite clause by an equivalent structure in 12.

10. It becomes necessary to take acount of the abilies that wil low th lener to adjust to changing circumstances, that is the development of a 'general capacity'. (Ellis-Late)   
11. We need more studies on the new contexts of communication spawned by globalization-i.e, in the domains of diaspora, outsourcing, and business and production networks. (Canagarajah-Middle)   
12. Next suppose instead that Group  members are articles .. that every one of the men is represented as (101). (Jackendoff-arly)

Semantically speaking, however, the spectrum of variation betweenthe constituents of reformulation acts is much broader and may imply various semantic equivalence patterns binding the reformulated and reformulating units. For example, reformulating units following or can provide an altenative synonymous words and expressions recognised as different appellations in other approaches or by different authors as in 13. Additionall, they can enable word meanings to move from the general to the specific (technical) or in the reverse mode as in 14 or can afect the semantic and pragmatic intensity (stronger or weaker) of lexical words (15).

13. Describing this as metatext or text reflexivity (Mauranen, 1993) ... (Hyland-Late)   
14. As well as a foundational text or Manifesto ... (Van Dijk-Late)   
15. They simply state relations that may or must obtain between various parts of two (or more) independent structures. Jackendoff Late)

These equivalent meanings are rooted in the premise that code glosses fundamentall serve interpersonal meanings (Hyland, 2005a; Hyland & Jiang, 2022). Such an understanding suggests that novel terminologies emerge to elucidate obscure and intricate concepts or to direct readers towards the writer's preferred interpretation (Hyland, 2007, p. 277). Whil this might be the case inthe texts of the six authors, a cloer lok at o in Van Dijk's corus indicate that it s used more regularl to altenate and embellish rather than to clarify opaque meanings. Van Dijk's use of or often involves synonymous words that have straightforward meanings illustrated in 16-20) where the reformulating units are very similar to the original ones (Younis et al., 2023, p. 22) and play litte or no role in elaborating the meaning.

16. The name of the Aims or Goals of a/this movement ... (Van Dijk-Late)   
17. The Opponent or Enemies of the movement ... (Van Dijk-Late)   
18. Violate communicative rules or principles ... (Van Dijk-Middle)   
19. Including possible causes or reasons ... (Vand Dijk-Early)   
20. In the context or situation of international political interaction ... (Van Dijk-Early)

It i also noticeable that in these examples, the syntactic property of the reformulated units seems to constraint the reformulato. choices available to writers. Thus, if another reformulator is placed in the position of or, the structures become somehow awkward (\*the name of the Aims, that is, goals, \*the opponents, in other words, the enemies, \*including possible causes especiall reasons).

# 6. Conclusion and final thoughts

This study has explored how exemplification and reformulation are quantitatively and qualitatively used by leading ingusts. Data showed that expert scholars have demonstrated conventional (un-marked) and non-conventional or marked frequencies in the use of exemplification and rformulation functions as wellas the st of explicit signals they opt for to introduce them. The overall results and their comparison with findings in the literature indicate that they use the two forms much more frequently than other linguis, novice and expert alike, which makes them stand out compared to their peers. Thus, as apposition is ppropriately used to guarantee clarity and rigour inacademic writing in geeral, it reflects more adanced forms of expert writing skill that distingush the most sucessul ones. Interestingly, those reputable writers used these discourse functions quite differentl from each other, both quantatively and qualitatively. The choice of markers also revealed some clear variation between the authors who opted for one or more types, reflecting again some stylistic preferences. With such significant variations between them, it would be wise to consider each author separately and consider how far away they deviate from the average score f other expert linguists. The expertise cline, however, sems not to e affected by temporal dimensions as the findings exhibited no linear evolution in the use of exemplification and reformulation from the early published papers to the latest ones. In fact, each single author displayed quite unique choices in early, middle and lat career stages and when compared to other expert writings in the field they did not alig. While it i hard to generalise such an observation to allacdmics, t stl indicat tht the i insts xiit vai e in thr rtive carrs ad my r qtions aout the stylistic characteristics of other linguists. Bearing in mind that early career researchers, including PhD students, can and do publish research in highly reputed journals and edited volumes, the long-existing asymmetry between expert writers' discourse versus novice or less expert types of academic writing should be relativised.

Looking into the patterns of variation between the six linguists, I have argued that the less salient personal forms of language choices, such as the ones whereby authors elaborate on discourse viaexemplification and reformulation, can reveal profound insights about authorial voice. In other words, the ideational and textual choices made in a text can construct identities (Ivanic & Camps, 2001). Thus, appositive elaborative discourse functions can be considered markers of style in academic writing, at the level of the choice of the marker, th frequency of theappositive, the preferred neghbouring syntactic and semantic ctexts but also the natureof the exemplifying rrformulating units (a feature to be further explored in future reearch). Academic writing style inthis context is to be understood as the set f authorial writing habits, the retitive syntactic and discursive patterns that they replicate from one text to another. The unique peculiarities in authors' choices, for example, not using ie in several texts of the same author, despite its high frequencies in other expert and non-expert academic texts, or the abundant use of or across dfferent texts by the same author while the use of the same reformulator is significantly lower in comparable texts, point towards idiosyncratic tastes and writing habits that should be considered additional factors to disciplinary conventions as well as other dimensions that can affect textual variations such as the ones considered in Omidian t al. (2021). It becomes, therefore, valuable to go beyond the \*situational variables (Gardner et al., 2019, p. 649) while accounting for novice and or expert writing texts and corpora by acknowledging the personalised stylisic choices or what could be termed individuality syndromes. Although implicitly acknowledged that \*research writing practices could be also influenced by internal variables related to certain author characteristics' (Omidian et al., 2021: 2), those individualit yndromes are often restricted to authors' L1 influence without admiting personalised writing habits or authorship fingerprints. Similarl, Gray's (2015) explanation of the variations observed within the same academic discipline was somehow restricted to the impact of the research method variable, leaving out the potential inluence of authorial writig styles. Like other lexical and syntactic features that mark authorship style, the recurrence of specific discourse functions (eg, exemplifying, reformulating, defining, comparing and contrasting,citing and reporting) and their respective lexico-rammatical manifestations can add further insights into uthorship style.

The results of this study are not to be undersood as the more you exemplify and reformulate the more sucessul your writing will be', neither do they suggest that whenever you choose to include such discourse functions you have to use an explicit marker or a specific one. In fact procdural meanings tying the units of the dicourse function can stil be retieved by the readers (Jimenez, 2022, p. 215). Although clearly admitted by Sword (2012: 99 that nearlyall stylish academic writer ply their readers with well-chosen examples, examples, and more examples" (italic in original), the findings of this study simply point towards the general tendency and the actual practices by some f the most prominent inguists and how their use of these functions significantly diffr from other linguists and from novice researchers in the field. More significantly, such observations suggest that there is more disparit than conformity within the single discipline. Accordingly, exemplification and reformulation could be viewed as empowering tools in successful academic writing. The findings also show that some significant variations exist between the same successful linguists as some of them would have personal preferences for specific markers over others and would exemplify or paraphrase in astructural way that would demarcate them from the common trends. The implication of these fact can be fundamental for les experienced or novice researchers and writers specificall if we consider implicit or incidental learning forms of effctive elaborative trategies. Through frequent exposure to leading linguists' writings, other researchers can indirectly acquire and replicate their felicitous elaborative techniques a method valued in lowerde (2011: 525) who streses that\*t isesentil that leners se what resources they may draw upon to establish the types of meaning - action, propositional content, and identity". Exposing learnersto the practices of the most successul academics in their field would represent those adequate and convenient resources that Flowerdew refers to.

This study is oviously limited in scope as it addresses only six authors and focuses on a limited number of mixed genre texts. In addition, further qualitative reearch focusing on the functional variation between authors and between carr perios would certainly complement the findings reported here. Another limitation is imposed by the explicit or transparent nature of metadiscourse units, rendering it hard to capture exemplification and reformulation units that are implictly integrated or juxtaposed within and across clauses. As such, it would be inriguing to investigate how authors exemplify and reformulate ideas without using explicit markers, and to determine if this affcts the paterns observed. Additioall, this could provide further inights into individual tyle preferences. Another ine of investigation would be to study these elaborative features of the same authors in diffrent situational contexts, ., different registers and text-types, and ee how much variation is related to individual user-related style versus how much is context userelated.
