# ABSTRACT

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been considered a powerful tool for fostering language learning and applied to various language-learning contexts. Yet, language teachers might lack adequate knowledge about how to integrate AI into classrooms to facilitate students’ learning effectively. To address the issue, this paper reports on an innovative practice to enhance secondary school students’ creative writing by leveraging AI’s capability for natural language generation (NLG). Specifically, we describe two learning designs for teaching students to write short stories with an AI-NLG writing tool (i.e. Text Generator), with one aiming at providing students with hands-on experience with the tool and the other offering scaffolds to compose short stories. We present the purposes, intended learning outcomes, learning activities, and materials and resources of the learning designs. Besides, we discuss the learning performance and achievements of four students who learnt with the designs. We also analyzed the students’ creativity in the ideas of their short stories to examine the effects of writing with Text Generator. Finally, we reflect on our implementation of the innovative practice, outline the pedagogical lessons we learnt, and provide suggestions for future research on using AI to enhance the teaching and learning of writing. We anticipate that writing educators and researchers can replicate, evaluate and improve the learning designs, to better support students’ learning of writing with AI.

# Introduction

A main objective in the language classroom is to spur students to write, as this productive ability confers language benefits such as enhancing students’ reading skills (Graham et al. 2014) and learning in other subject areas and disciplines (Miller, Scott, and McTigue 2018). However, writing is a skill acquired with great difficulty and effort. Students who write creatively often encounter technical and attitudinal problems (Lee 2019). This is not least because the writing curriculum in the language classroom has more often focused on control and containment than on creative expression (McCallum 2012). Similarly, creativity has been viewed narrowly in terms of language proficiency and not content and ideas (Wang and Cheng 2016). Therefore, as a matter of teaching and learning practice, writing creatively has appeared problematic in the classroom.

Teachers can help students address some challenges and facilitate their creative writing, not least by providing them with appropriate computer-based, online approaches and strategies such as writing through the use of social media (Godwin-Jones 2018) or digital storytelling (Yang, Chen, and Hung 2022). At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI), which has referred to computers that can imitate features of human intelligence such as creative work and language interaction (UNESCO 2022), can assist learners at any time (Rojas-Muñoz, Couperus, and Wachs 2021) and can improve existing teaching and learning practices (Wang and Cheng 2021).

AI is capable of natural language generation (NLG), that is, to produce comprehensible human language texts from information (Gatt and Krahmer 2018). AI’s capability for NLG should not replace human effort but can potentially augment human effort so that AI remains under human control and improves human activity (Yang, Ogata, and Matsui 2023). In the language classroom, students can learn to write with AI. Efforts have been made to conceptualize this human-AI collaboration as writing with a machine-in-the-loop (Clark et al. 2018). When writing with a machine-inthe-loop, humans are central actors, AI plays a supporting role, and humans have full agency to decide what to do with text generated from AI, if anything.

This paper reports on an innovative practice that operationalizes creative writing with machinein-the-loop for the language classroom. The practice comprises students writing short stories using their own words and words generated from their interactions with an AI-NLG writing tool, Text Generator, designed by the first author. The paper aims to facilitate the replication and evaluation of the practice by reporting the learning designs or frameworks for describing learning environments and activities (Conole and Wills 2013).

# Material and methods

# Context

We developed the practice for a ‘1st Human-AI Creative Writing Contest’ prosecuted in an all-girls Hong Kong secondary school, which like other Hong Kong secondary schools delivers curriculum to students in secondary grade levels one through six. The contest rules were to write a story of no more than 500 words, and to title the story either ‘Charity begins at home’ or ‘There is some good in the world and it is worth fighting for.’ Students were to complete their stories on Google Docs and highlight their own words in red and those generated from Text Generator in black (see Figure 1).

To prepare students for the contest, we designed and implemented seven workshops from 1 March to 5 April 2022. Since in-person schooling was suspended, the workshops were conducted online via Zoom. Each workshop was approximately 1 h and attendance was voluntary. The first author delivered the workshops in the English language.

# Participants

Four students, Students H, M, S and W, voluntarily enrolled in the contest. Table 1 presents details of the student participants. The school streams students from each grade-level into classes according to English language ability and all students were placed in the highest ability class in their respective grade-levels.

Daniel Fleck walked around the Invention Fair searching. A huge water tank caught his eye.

"Bubble break! Get your b-bubble b-break here!!.

Daniel walked to the counter, a young man was floating inside the water tank

Next thing you know, Daniel is talking business with this kid, Charlie "So, what's this all about?" asked Daniel, holding the test tube in his hand.

Charlie pushed back his huge glasses nervously..

"It's a formula that helps you b-breathe underwater," he stuttered.

"Does it work?"

Charlie beamed in excitement and told him his lifelong project. Daniel nodded. glanced over the water tank and the test tube in his hand. "It won't kill me, right?"

"Of course not!" Charlie slammed his hand on the table. "I tried it on myself!"

Daniel nodded, drank it and jumped inside the water tank. He held his breath. Then suddenly he felt a sharp jab on his foot. He gasped...gasped...gasped. But didn't feel the burning sensation of drowning. There was a transparent bubble helmet protecting his head. And he can breathe!

"I'm sorry! Bad Jacob, bad! Charlie screamed, reaching for his pet lobster. Daniel got out and grabbed Charlie's shoulders tightly..   
"WE.NEED.TO.TALK"

# Learning designs

Since few learning designs exist for student learning with generative AI (Ali et al. 2021) and we know little about how students write creatively with a machine-in-the-loop and how to teach creative writing with such tools, during the workshops we designed materials and resources iteratively. These include (1) reflection questions that students answered at the end of each workshop; and (2) a rating rubric that evaluated students’ short story writing with AI from four aspects, including content, language, organization, and AI words usage. For these materials and resources, see Supplemental Online Materials.

We also composed (1) Text Generator, the AI-NLG tool that autocompletes a user’s input text, that is, predicts or infers text to follow a user’s input text based on its language model and that can generate words (Figure 2), sentences (Figure 3), and paragraphs (Figure 4). We composed Text Generator with free-to-use, open-source language models and visible Python code so that educators could easily replicate the tools or adapt them by swapping the language models. For instance, we designed Text Generator to generate sentences from GPT-2 large, GPT-NEO-2.7B and GPT-J-6B to provide students with diverse output. These language models are different in terms of the size of the data on which they were trained, the quality of the data on which they were trained and thus, their understanding of language. They can be replaced in Text Generator by other models, including larger models and more recent models.

Figure 2. Text Generator interface (next word generation).

We adopted an outcome-based workshop design so that for any workshop, we first designed the workshop’s intended learning outcomes (ILOs), which is what students should achieve by the end of the workshop. Then we designed the learning activities, that is, basic units of interaction with or among learners. Although we only designed a subsequent workshop after implementing and evaluating a previous workshop, the learning activities of all the workshops followed the same template: (1) the teacher introduced ILOs and demonstrated achievement of the ILOs; (2) students practiced writing; and (3) students reflected on their learning by answering explicit reflection questions. For example, in the first workshop that the four students attended, an ILO was, ‘I can locate Text Generator and use its features.’ In this way, the learning activities included: the teacher demonstrating Text Generator’s interfaces; the teacher inputting different lengths of text to demonstrate how input length could influence the coherence and length of Text Generator’s output; and the teacher inputting different genre features such as a story title and an excerpt of story dialogue to demonstrate that Text Generator could generate coherent text for these features. The activities also included the teacher reading and comparing different outputs and integrating relevant outputs into a story on Google Docs. Students had 30 min to use Text Generator. At that time, they reported no difficulties in using Text Generator but upon reflection had developed preferences for particular interfaces.

Since workshop development was iterative, the content of workshop learning designs could overlap from one workshop to the next. To highlight a range of purposes, learning outcomes and learning activities of the practice, we have selected two learning designs from workshops three and five (see Table 2) for presentation. Each design comprises its (1) title, (2) purpose, (3) ILOs, (4) actual learning activities, and (5) materials and resources.

# Implementation and results

The following two sections elaborate on each design in terms of the purpose and background of each, followed by a summary of activities. Student achievement of ILOs is then evaluated, with specific ILOs cited in brackets. Then, we present our evaluation of the students’ creativity in their short stories written with Text Generator. Finally, the teacher’s learning and follow-up actions are described.

# Learning design one

The purpose of the first learning design was to provide students with explicit instruction for digital writing with a machine-in-the-loop. To demonstrate, the teacher had written the first clause of a short story on Google Docs, pasted that clause in Text Generator to generate words, sentences and paragraphs, and pasted selected Text Generator words, sentences and paragraphs in Google Docs, editing them and highlighting text. After initial interactions with Text Generator, students were given opportunities to practice digital writing skills on Google Docs (ILO1). Besides, by observing students’ Google Docs, the teacher could assess students’ dragging and highlighting text; copying and pasting Text Generator input and output text; deleting text; typing text; and changing text color. Student W participated in the workshop.

After 30 min of writing, Student W gave her story a title and demonstrated digital writing skills (ILO1). However, Student W struggled to develop a method to write a short story using her own words and AI words (ILO2) and to compose a story according to the contest rules. For instance, she asked the teacher if she must write a short story; she added that Text Generator’s output was quotes, instead of a whole story, and she was thinking of the story’s content. When the teacher read her writing, the teacher observed the lack of basic short story elements such as characters, time, place and plot structure. In this way, the teacher suggested Student W orient the reader to the time, place, characters and action. The teacher suggested she introduce an action in the first paragraph and use phrases such as ‘Once upon a time,’ or ‘One day,’ to introduce time and then a place.

When answering reflection questions, Student W asked the teacher to clarify reflection question 4, ‘How did you decide which words, sentences or paragraphs to put into Text Generator?’ so that the teacher demonstrated putting text into an input box. At the same time, Student W shared that she had been using her mobile phone for learning activities during the workshop because she was away from home and had no other access to computer hardware and software; she had received errors from Text Generator when using its next sentence generation function (ILO3). The teacher could not successfully troubleshoot the student’s errors and suggested she use the next word and next paragraph generative functions of Text Generator.

For the next design, we revised the reflection questions for clarity and added a screenshot requirement. Besides, we became aware of differences in students’ access to computer hardware, software and supporting infrastructure, and the possibility that these might contribute to errors that students experience when using Text Generator.

# Learning design two

The purpose of the second learning design was to introduce students to the text type of short stories (ILO2), because we had observed students’ difficulties in producing the features of a short story. Students H, M and W participated in this workshop, which lasted $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .

In the workshop, students structured their plot (see Figure 5 for an example outline), practiced digital writing skills (ILO1) and were given time to reflect.

The students demonstrated varying degrees of proficiency when outlining their short stories and translating story elements into prose (ILO2). Student M appeared the most proficient. For instance,

Main character:the man   
Other characters: the old woman   
Where: India   
When: 10 years ago   
Conflict: human versus human Rising action   
1.the man approached to the old woman   
2.The old woman did not accept his invitation since this man looked poor and hungry.

# Climax

1.Thd man is going to help the old woman to fix her flat tire.   
2. He did not ask the old woman to pay him back.   
3. He told the old woman to help others as a payment for this deed   
Resolution 1. The old woman helped the poor people in the slum , she spreaded love to others

she was the first student to describe her story’s conflict. In contrast, Student H had difficulty explaining her story’s conflict. Student W appeared to struggle the most in planning and translating. For example, the teacher observed that Student W’s exposition prose did not include all the elements in her exposition outline. Later, the teacher delivered instructions on a plot structure outline when Students H and M had completed their conflict outlines (ILO2) but Student W had not.

The students did not have time during the workshop to use Text Generator so they only answered reflection question five, ‘Did you have a goal for today’s session? If so, what was it? And did you achieve it?’ Student H said she had structured her story and would finish the story. Student M said she did not finish her story but would try that day. Student W had no goal.

The final workshop’s purpose was to provide students with time to complete their stories with Text Generator, revisiting the first learning design’s second and third ILOs, now with story ideas and structure. Students M and W reported achieving the ILOs. Reflecting, Student M said she input only one sentence at a time into the paragraph-generating interface of Text Generator, choosing any sentences that made sense for her story (see Figure 6). Student W said she interacted with the sentence-generating interface of Text Generator whenever she needed details and could not think of the next word or sentence (see Figure 7). When Text Generator ideas did not match hers, she selected only a few Text Generator words to use. Besides, the teacher provided ideas that Student W might input into the Text Generator.

# Effects on students’ creativity in their story writing

# Analyzing the students’ short stories

We examined students’ creativity through a content analysis (Schreier 2014) of their texts (see Supplemental Online Material for the full texts). First, we developed a creative writing performance rubric (see Supplemental Online Material) that operationalizes three of Torrance’s (1988) creativity constructs: originality; flexibility; and elaboration. Each construct’s total possible score is 5 points and a story’s total possible score is 15 points. We applied the rubric only to ideas about a main

Copy or type text. Submit and the machine will generate text.

Figure 6. A screenshot of Student M using Text Generator.

and supporting character. Using the rubric, the first and second authors independently scored the main and supporting characters according to the dimensions of each construct. They reviewed their scores, resolved scoring discrepancies and revised the rubric. To identify AI’s specific contributions to students’ creativity in writing, the authors identified representative sentences for elaboration, flexibility and originality in each story. Then they analyzed the extent to which Text Generator contributed words for the representative sentences and noted which words.

# Results

Table 3 presents the number and percentage of words generated by the students themselves and Text Generator, respectively, in the four short stories.

Table 4 summarizes the scores given to the four texts using the rubric. The scores are organized by construct, and then by the main character and the supporting character of each text. An underlined score indicates a score that was averaged and rounded up. A plus sign is given beside a score if words from Text Generator contributed to that character’s representative sentences for that creativity construct.

The results indicate that the AI-supported approach can contribute significantly to students’ creative writing. Although the approach contributed to elaboration, flexibility and originality, it did so to each differently, affecting the construct of elaboration the most, and flexibility the least. Furthermore, writing with Text Generator can contribute to the creativity of the main and supporting characters, with its greater contribution to the representative sentences of the main characters. This is because students naturally pay more attention to developing main characters, and write more sentences about main characters than supporting characters. In other words, the number of sentences about a character corresponds with opportunities for Text Generator to contribute to that character.

# Discussion

This paper has presented two learning designs for fostering secondary school students’ creative story writing with AI-NLG tools. This section presents the pedagogical lessons we learnt from implementing the workshops using these two learning designs. We discuss the lessons as both benefits and challenges. We also suggest adaptations so that writing teachers may make better decisions when prosecuting creative writing with AI.

One beneficial pedagogical lesson is the utility of student reflection as a learning activity to conclude each design. Reflection facilitates students looking into and articulating their creative processes (Kirk and Pitches 2013). It reveals meaningful learning opportunities for writing to foster students’ proficiency in English use and creativity (Yang, Chen, and Hung 2022). Importantly, reflection can shed light on students’ cognitive processes while writing creatively with AI-NLG tools, so teachers can better understand how students interact with tools’ output (Bhat et al. 2023) and how students feel about such output (Anderson, Shah, and Kreminski 2024). That evidence alongside observation of student work, surveys and other instruments (Lee et al. 2021) can inform the development of workshops and AI-NLG tools.

A similarly beneficial pedagogical lesson is that the learning designs have followed a modular structure for AI curriculum (Chiu et al. 2022). In this way, each learning design can stand independent of the other; globally, each adds to the body of knowledge about learning designs with generative AI (Ali et al. 2021); and locally, each learning design can be a response to students’ needs, for instance, as identified from student reflections or observations of student work. This modular structure benefited students in the workshops when it became clear that some students were unfamiliar with writing short stories and had not received relevant instruction in their school curriculum, to adapt to those language needs, in the fifth workshop we implemented learning design two which introduced story planning activities. For educators, it is possible to implement either learning design before the other. Alternatively, educators can omit learning designs that do not suit their students’ language needs. For instance, educators do not need to implement learning design two if students are already familiar with planning short stories or are writing another text type.

Other beneficial pedagogical lessons are lowering barriers to access (Williams et al. 2023) and adopting an interactive, open-ended approach (Zhang et al. 2023). We designed the AI-NLG writing tool to be easily accessed on the Internet and intuitive for students to use. We designed the tool to receive a wide variety of text input and to generate a wide variety of text output. We tasked students with using the tool to write stories with few content and style constraints. Therefore, without extensive knowledge of mathematics, computer science or the English language, students can learn from AI to actively and independently develop strategies to interact with AI to complete a task (Kim, Lee, and Cho 2022). Importantly, students can personalize their learning (Zhai et al. 2021) as they adapt their interaction strategies with AI-NLG writing tools. Educators can identify effective strategies, model those strategies, and recommend those strategies to enable students who show different learning trajectories and different paces to learn with AI (Woo et al. 2023).

A challenging pedagogical lesson has been accounting for students’ diverse ICT hardware and supporting infrastructure. Specifically, since accessing the AI-NLG writing tool required only a computer, an Internet connection and a link to the tool, during the pre-contest workshops the students used laptops, iPads or smartphones, using WIFI or cellular data. Thus, at times the students’ devices and infrastructure could become unreliable, such as when an Internet connection failed; besides, sometimes they used smaller mobile phone screens and did not use physical keyboards so their digital writing with the AI-NLG writing tool slowed considerably during the workshops.

A related challenging pedagogical lesson has been the teacher troubleshooting students’ technical problems with digital writing and the AI-NLG writing tool. First, we had to identify whether any technical problem lay with the tool, students’ devices or their supporting infrastructure. Then, we might address the problem. For instance, since the time of study we have found that Text Generator has experienced problems because of supporting infrastructure, specifically, the deprecation of functions within Text Generator’s Python code and because of the degradation of free-to-use hardware on Hugging Face Spaces. Educators might not successfully identify and address any technical problem without sufficient knowledge about AI, computer programming skills and general technological knowledge. One adaptation educators can make is to standardize students’ ICT hardware and their learning environment. Or educators can suggest familiar ICT hardware and supporting infrastructure for interacting with AI-NLG writing tools.

A final challenge has been our learning designs have not included an explicit ethical approach. Although our assessment rubric incentivized students to write with AI words in a particular way and our implementation provided no evidence of the following use case, in other contexts students may not develop their creative writing with AI-NLG tools. This is because they use AI-NLG tools like ChatGPT and heavily rely on its text to replace their writing. One adaptation educators can make is to set an ILO so that students appreciate this hypothetical use case’s positive and negative consequences. Another is to expand the scope of students’ knowledge of creative writing with AI-NLG tools. For instance, students can learn how to use AI-NLG tools at different stages of a creative writing process (Hyland 2019), from pre-writing to composing, responding and editing. They can learn to apply a wider range of AI-NLG tool capabilities (Ouyang et al. 2022) as they may only be familiar with the tool’s text generation capability. Thus, students could be taught how to prompt an AI-NLG tool to brainstorm ideas at the pre-writing stage, or summarize and critique students’ writing at the responding stage. By understanding the consequences of heavily relying on AI-generated text, and being equipped with more knowledge about creative writing and AI-NLG capabilities, students could invest their effort into the ethical use of AI-NLG writing tools.

# Conclusion

This paper described two learning designs for teaching secondary school students to write short stories with AI by presenting their purposes, intended learning outcomes, learning activities and materials and resources. We discussed four Hong Kong students’ achievement of ILOs, the effects of writing with AI on their creativity in their story writing, and our learning from conducting the workshops and follow-up actions. We summarized the pedagogical lessons we learnt from implementing the innovative practice, highlighted both benefits of and challenges in developing and applying the learning designs, and provided practical suggestions for writing teachers, based on our experience. Future research can examine the effects of creative writing with AI on students’ writing development. Readers will be interested in research reports about how students interact with AI in generating ideas and writing stories, the strategies students use for the interactions, and how students perceive AI’s role in facilitating their writing processes. The findings of such research will not only inform writing teachers’ integration of AI into classrooms but also provide insights for future design and development of AI-based tools for the teaching and learning of writing in the language classroom.
