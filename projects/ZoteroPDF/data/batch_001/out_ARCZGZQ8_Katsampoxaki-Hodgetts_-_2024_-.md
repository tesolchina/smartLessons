Keywords: Visual remediation Graphical abstract Multimodal literacy Skills and challenges Curriculum design

As scholarly communication becomes more multimodal in nature, research articles embrace semiotic resources in appended genres such as the graphical abstract (GA). As an established genre in Chemistry research articles, GAs visually remediate chemical processes or research niche. However, this genre still remains in a peripheral area of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) courses as ESP practitioners mainly focus on textual modes. With limited opportunities to compose GAs, students foster genre remediation skills that are limited to textual genres only, ignoring the potential of reading-to-design skills. Upon student composition and critical reflections on GAs, as well as qualitative and quantitative data collection from a survey and interview involving professors, young researchers (YRs) and students, this paper examines rhetorical functions as well as image and text relations, while throwing some light on skills and challenges involved when GA composition is intentionally embedded in an ESP course, and discusses ensuing pedagogical implications.

# 1. Introduction

Online affordances have induced numerous changes in scholarly communication practices (Luzón and Pérez-Llantada, 2022). Researchers now browse online to find the state-of-the-art and disseminate research using visually appealing designs. Including a variety of semiotic resources (Kress, 2003), the research article (RA) is now dynamic and not monomodal; multimodality challenges ‘long-held assumptions of the sufficiency of ‘language’ for all communicational needs’ (Kress, 2015, p. 49). Abstracts also come as Graphical Abstracts (GA), video-abstracts, audiovisual summaries adopted by well-known publishers (e.g. Elsevier and ACS publications) as additional ‘typified’ RA genres. Scholarly or scientific communication focus on language as textual communication is just one mode. Alternative modes can be verbal, visual, auditory and altogether they can be delivered though various media (online or printed article) now determining digital genre characteristics; appended genres like the GA (Sancho Guinda, 2015) bear visual affordances with less time-consuming inquiries of visual summaries. As such, digital genres in the disciplines appear to re-shape or even enhance writing processes for academic journals and effectively disseminate academic work (Paltridge, 2020). New RA ‘add-on genres’ (Luzón and Pérez-Llantada, 2019) or ‘appendant genres’ (Yang, 2017) remediate traditional genres zooming in on wider implications of the established genres or ‘refashion prior media forms’ (Bolter and Grusin, 1999, p. 273).

GAs as a new online scientific digital genre and typical of visual traditions in STEM (Sancho Guinda, 2016) and as remediated visual summaries with eye-catching visuals to attract reader attention and increase journal visibility (Nature

Chemistry Editorial, 2011; Hendges and Florek, 2019, p. 61), “distil the take-home message of an article into an image” (ibid, p. 66). Similar to its textual counterparts, GAs use different lexicons (shapes, volumes), typography and composition strategies (Sancho Guinda, 2016), design patterns (Hullman and Bach, 2018), taxonomy of visual metadiscourse (Sancho Guinda, 2021) and grammar (Kress and and van Leeuwen, 2006) that are discipline-specific (Hendges and Florek, 2019, p. 69). Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) stress the importance of understanding the inaugural ’grammars’ of image for scholarly users. Also, social semiotics school makes a distinction among producers, users and consumers; hence, multimodality accommodates further revisions ‘from the perspective of the designer-as-producer, or from the designer-as-user point of view’ (Kress and Selander, 2012, p. 166). As such, embedding GAs in language courses ‘alongside more traditional literacy practices, as one element of the course design’ (Hafner, 2014, p. 682) and fostering multimodal composition as a multiliteracy seems germane as intentional multimodality embedding in the curriculum allows students to practice ‘semiotic reconstruals’ (Zhang and O’Halloran, 2019, p. 2), i.e. semiotic remediation, recycling, reconstruction and mixing of modes to achieve a communicative purpose.

However, despite the multitude of studies exploring multimodality (Grapin and Llosa, 2020; Kress, 2010; Van Leeuwen, 2005), English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP) researchers and practitioners still over-rely on ‘the spoken and written genres and on products rather than processes’ (Belcher, 2006, 149). Also, ESAP researchers have not yet fully explored the pedagogical potential of the ‘situated socio cultural practices’ within multimodal frameworks; ‘multimodality seems to have remained somewhat peripheral’ mainly due to traditional logocentric theories dominating research methods (Prior, 2013, p. 520). As digital academic genres often constitute ‘a challenge to traditional genre theory’ (Askehave and Nielsen, 2005), multimodal remediation still remains ‘on the margins’ (Early et al., 2015) as an EAP/ESP practice. This is often because practitioners tend to foster students’ genre remediation skills using textual genres only, ignoring the potential of reading-todesign skills that can be fostered by multimodal remediation of GAs. Lack of uniformity in GAs reported in previous research (Lane et al., 2015; Sancho Guinda, 2015, 2016, 2022; Yoon and Chung, 2017) may explain ESP/EAP practitioners’ hesitation to embed visual genres in their courses, yet, as a result, students often have limited opportunities to compose GAs and foster relevant remediation skills.

This work examines the perceptions of students of Chemistry as composers of GAs, sheds light on essential skills and challenges within their situated socio cultural practices, provides insights regarding EAP/ESP subsequent practices and discusses genre-based pedagogy unpacking the complexity of multiliteracy development and multimodal remediation.

# 2. Literature review

The lack of linearity of digital RAs requires skills that genre composers or EAP/ESP teachers may lack, such as visual literacy or ‘non-textual social practices’ (Sancho Guinda, 2015, p. 74). Royce’s (2007) definition of multiliteracies urges teachers to “focus on and develop students’ abilities in visual literacy, and to develop a pedagogical metalanguage to facilitate these abilities when images co-occur with spoken and written modes” (p. 366). Jones and Hafner (2021) and Hafner and Miller (2019) suggest embedding multimodal ensembles in EAP/ESP courses to foster digital literacy. Multimodal literacy processes through reading, writing, speaking, listening, also include designing and viewing ‘occurring within and around new communication media’ (Walsh, 2010, pp 213). Process-oriented notions of multimodality scaffolding can also employ authentic digitally mediated processes (Hafner and Miller, 2019) engaging students into multimodal and digital scholarly actions mirroring actions scientists perform (Luzón and Pérez-Llantada, 2022, p. 5–6), including ‘showing’ research through audiovisual genres’. Conventional and state-of-the-art scholarly genres are now perceived as ‘multi-semiotic’ (Prior, 2013) broaching and framing multimodal systems across disciplines. Transferring genre theory discussion from monomodal linear texts to multimodal non-linear texts (Van Leeuwen, 2005, p. 74) is imperative as genre-oriented instruction can effectively prepare students for the writing expected to be produced during their academic careers (e.g., Bazerman, 2004).

Pérez-Llantada (2016) considers how the digital medium is shaping RA genres drawing on interface visuality and multimedia features. Online Chemistry RAs often include GAs that complement the typical verbal abstracts; this innovation predated the digital medium but it became widespread because of it (Soldera, 2021) as clarity and visibility of mechanisms and products are desirable attributes (Soldera, 2021). GAs as add-on genres enhance the traditional genre by ‘showing’ the research method or outcome (Luzón and Pérez-Llantada, 2022), exhibit image integrity (Image Integrity, 2022) and perform similar functions to the main textual RA body. They also promote public understanding of science and reproducibility of scientific protocols, engaging both the expert and laypeople (Luzón, 2019). Despite being perceived as popularised regurgitations of scientific research, they are often employed as model multimodal examples of scientific discourse that may facilitate student digital genre awareness (Katsampoxaki-Hodgetts, 2022); before production, students may notice, compare and reflect on how GAs disseminate knowledge to diversified audiences, how they may raise awareness of pressing (health and ecological) issues or indicate the relevance of research niche to real societal needs. Also, combined semiotic modes often reach out to the public and increase ‘proximity’, i.e. ‘how writers represent not only themselves and their readers, but also adapt their material to meet readers’ expectations (Hyland’s, 2010, p. 117), increase narrative persuasion (Finkler and León, 2019), help ’ convey a feeling of intimacy and bridge the social distance between experts and lay audience’ (Luzón and Pérez-Llantada, 2022, p. 146).

As genre chains flow logically from one another in a sequential manner being rather hierarchical (Swales, 2004), hierarchical relationships exist among traditional genre and part-genres, among traditional part-genres (i.e. abstract) and digital add-ons (i.e. research highlights) and among digital part-genres (i.e. bigger picture) and their multimodal equivalents (i.e.GA) (Katsampoxaki-Hodgetts, 2022). Digital RAs are connected intertextually and this interconnectedness can be exploited by

ESAP practitioners to increase student awareness of genre versatility, flexibility, intertextuality and interdiscursivity. Yet, scholarly users also need to understand how social semiotics can shed light on the synergy between different modalities within a multimodal text; student awareness of inter- intra- and trans modalities (Schaffer and Clinton, 2006, p. 291) are three multimodal instances in online research papers that can also be pedagogically exploited by ESP teachers as essential multiliteracies in Higher Education with regards to selecting, combining and composing multimodal genres. Composition of visual or multimodal genres can raise awareness of underlying hierarchies and potentially challenge student future perceptions of them when they become well-established researchers.

The changing nature of authorship in digital genres has changed the traditional user-audience roles of producer and consumer and various semiotic resources are blended and remediated while meaning making becomes ‘a shifting landscape of possibilities’ (Zawilksi, 2011, p. 32). With GAs and add-on summaries, traditional academic literacy has migrated away from an authoritarian concept of grammar and structure correctness to subjective student adaptability to code-switching (Zawilksi, 2011, p. 13) and ability to move across languages, modes and media.

Digital scientific RA communication is often characterised by ‘context collapse’, first coined by Marwick and Boyd (2011) and defined as the result of addressing an imaginary online ‘not static, geographically bound’ or ‘intrinsically institutionalised’ audience with ‘some degree of collective knowledge’ (p. 129). Further theorising by Davis and Jurgenson (2014) added two important categories; context collision and context collusion. Collision involves unintentional blurring of context boundaries, whereas collusion is perceived as intentional meshing of social contexts and recontextualisation through various modes, media or texts. As scholarly papers open access demands for transparency rise, changes are apparent both in professional/ online scientific genres and parascientific genres (i.e. blogs which ‘blur the boundaries between what are traditionally conceived of as professional genres of science communication and popular genres of science communication’ (Mehlenbacher and Mehlenbacher, 2019, p. 48) but have rarely been associated with visual genres. Although they do not refer to context collapse or GAs, Mehlenbacher and Mehlenbacher (2019, p. 55) stress that ‘the interplay between traditional genre forms and their online counterparts within a professional sphere of discourse’ ought to be explored. This intentional blurring or interplay of forms can be pedagogically explored by EAP teachers and course designers (Katsampoxaki-Hodgetts, 2022).

Yet, despite the focus on multimodality, non-verbal digital RAs genre are not yet fully pedagogically-exploited but inadvertently overlooked (Dressen, 2002). Researchers working on GAs have also argued that GAs are often just ‘visually appealing’ (Pérez-Llantada, 2016) in some disciplines (although these views are not prevalent in Chemistry). They have also claimed that GAs do not ‘extend information’ or that they add minimal information to the textual body of research (Sancho Guinda, 2015). Some analyse composition strategies (Sancho Guinda, 2016) while others examine whether students practicing designing visual genres or ‘reinventing’ new genres can increase genre awareness and foster composition skills as they ‘rework the voice of the other, the communal form, into their own individual [.] worldviews’ (Soliday, 2005, p. 82).

In this study, GAs were embedded in an ESAP Chemistry course due to researcher role as teacher and because GAs are an established genre in this discipline (Org.Lett. Author guidelines, 2022). Also, following GA composition, students (as users/ composers of GA) voice was recorded and analysed through rhetorical, contextual and multimodal lenses. This study aims to examine GA remediation skills, challenges embracing ‘voice-enhancing’ processes to ‘embolden struggling writers to express themselves’ (Belcher, 2017, p. 82), and discuss pedagogical implications of remedied RAs via GA composition. Student voice is explored in the research questions; after student composition of GAs and analysis of perceived skills and challenges, evidence based pedagogical implications are drawn from the data, and are representative of all users regardless their expertise.

Research questions are:

1. What are the rhetorical functions of Chemistry GAs?   
2. What skills or challenges do students report before/during the composition of GAs?

# 3. Context of study and participants

The research took place at a research-focused Department of Chemistry where senior undergraduate students are encouraged to publish their preliminary experimental work in English, although the medium of instruction is not English. The course in which the study was conducted was an ESAP university course (S1). The twenty four (24) participants came from various Chemistry fields and had varied expertise (See more in S2).

# 3.1. Study design

The corpus $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 8 0$ ) stems from two Chemistry journals, Organic Letters (Org.Lett.) and Chem, which heavily invest on visual clarity, research rigour, inclusion and accessibility to a wider audience (Chem Author guidelines, 2022; OrgLett Author guidelines, 2022), which were typical exemplars of different GA styles. Sample papers were used in the ESAP course and the time span in which student products were collected was in the Spring semester of 2021 (March). There were no selection criteria among papers other than open accessibility. Qualitative and quantitative methodology was employed, along with a mixed method design combining ethnographic techniques and tools (e.g. interviews, writer’s reflections), rhetorical and multimodal analysis, thematic analysis of users’ responses and reflective accounts via think-aloud reports. Analysed data provided insights regarding the pedagogical exploration of digital affordances during GA composition.

# 3.1.1. Questionnaire

It empirically explores context-bound views in a discipline-specific higher education setting. Questions were answered by all participants (S3).

# 3.1.2. Think-aloud reports

As reflective tools, think-aloud reports have a “sound theoretical basis and provide a valid source of data about participant thinking, especially during language based activities” (Charters, 2003, p. 68). Only seven students answered their Think-aloud reports and composed GAs (S4).

# 3.1.3. Tasks

Table 1 briefly describes tasks students completed before they wrote their think aloud reports and before the interview (S5).

# 3.1.4. Interviews

All participants took part in a semi structured $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ interview. Ten professors and seven YRs answered questions before the course started, while seven students answered the same questions upon completion of tasks and course (S6).

# 3.2. Data analysis

Linguistic, visual and other modes can often serve as ‘parallel discourses’ (Rowley-Jolivet and Carter-Thomas, 2005) that serve complementary or concurrent meaning-making functions. Drawing on previous research (Hiippala, 2014; Martinec and Salway, 2005), and Grapin and Llosa (2020), a Contextual Rhetorical and Multimodal (CRM) framework (Table 2) was developed. To inform the data analysis, part of Grapin and Llosa (2020) framework is integrated in this framework to show the interrelation between linguistic and non-linguistic modes in the GA. Text, image, hypertext, and video slides interplay is discussed in many studies (Carter-Thomas and Chambers, 2012; Lemke, 1998, 2002). For this reason, section 4 comprises four sections: content analysis, contextual analysis, rhetorical analysis and multimodal analysis that aim at addressing questions raised in Table 2.

Table 2 Contextual rhetorical and multimodal (CRM) framework of digital innovations as linguistic (textual) and non-linguistic (visual or multimodal) modes.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Analytical lenses applied in a Contextual Rhetorical and Multimodal (CRM) Framework of Digital Innovations</td><td>Questions to be answered</td></tr><tr><td>Content analysis: location of digital innovations</td><td>What digital innovations are prominent in this genre?

Following content and contextual analysis, I described GA rhetorical functions in the corpus before interpreting discourse types (Biber et al., 2007). Graphical abstracts just like other appended or add-on genres are not the outcome of the medium itself (Heyd, 2008); they serve performed ‘social actions’ (Miller, 1984) due to digital genre interconnectivity and multitude of expected communicative and rhetorical purposes. Belcher (2023) discusses how genre theory offers a powerful lens for understanding digital genres and how challenges posed by digital genres call for innovative and critical approaches. For the analysis, I used qualitative software NViVo (2022) following a grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) with a coding scheme whose categories were not predefined and whose codes were generated from the corpus before each GA rhetorical function or multimodal aspect was identified. The codes generated are shown in Table 3 and Table 5.

Through thematic analysis, I identified patterns and recurring themes in participants’ responses in qualitative data (survey responses, interview transcripts and Think aloud reports). Interviews were fully transcribed and analysis was conducted inductively twice (Chapman et al., 2015). Upon data familiarisation, new codes were generated and themes were reviewed according to Braun and Clarke’s (2006, p. 87) bottom-up, inductive way of developing a set of themes that are ‘grounded in’ and ‘emerge from’ the data (Hafner and Miller, 2019). To eliminate subjectivity and ensure inter-rater reliability, a second researcher from the field of Chemistry conducted the same classification and coding process with $9 5 \ \%$ consistency between researchers.

Multimodal analysis determines how the different semiotic elements contribute to the main communicative purpose. An important question examines genre status within RA. For example, the GA in both journals has a prominent position and is included in the main manuscript. Other questions concern interrelated linguistic and non-linguistic modes (Grapin and Llosa, 2020), mode complementarity and (un)equal status. As seen in section 4, GAs are remediated depictions of mechanisms or key findings. Genres are not viewed as standing alone but they are part of a genre ecology (Heyd, 2008; Spinuzzi, 2004); products of intertextuality and interdiscursivity (Bhatia, 2010; Fairclough, 2003), constantly progressing within a dialecticalrelational context that is shaped by its past, current and future linguistic and non-linguistic articulations.

Regarding semiotics, Martinec and Salway (2005) system of image-text relations in new and old media provides a second layer of analysis regarding status equality between digital innovations and the text. As such, the image is complementary to the text, subordinate to it or interdependent. Other parameters include the degree of specificity between image and text; how they may enhance each other, and how they are projected in terms of wording and meaning.

To shed light into participants’ perceptions of pedagogical potential of innovations in all datasets, a coherent justification of themes was established based on converging data or perspectives (Creswell, 2013) before the pedagogical implications were discussed. This mixture of methods is recommended when language teaching is concerned as it includes both ‘triangulation’ and ‘complementarity’ (Riazi and Candlin, 2014) allowing the researcher to make more credible and trustworthy claims after examining converging patterns or paradoxes.

# 4. Findings and discussion

This section presents key findings following the CMR framework and discusses remediation skills and challenges fostered upon composition of GAs and pedagogical implications in EAP/ESP course design.

In line with CRM analysis, GAs are perceived as visual summaries situating research in a wider context while serving as a recontextualisation with visual realisations. As suggested, mastering the skill of semiotic remediation depends on reading comprehension, critical evaluation of key points and awareness of scientific conventions. Datasets confirmed GA’s rhetorical functions (section 4.3) as an add-on remediated promotional genre with added value, indicative of inter-connectivity between traditional and new RA part-genres and of the significance of visual modes in scientific discourse. Following GA composition, semiotic remediation, in the form of ‘reading as viewing’ and ‘reading to design’, is identified as a key skill (section 4.5) that calls for apt pedagogical approaches (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

# 4.1. Content analysis

GAs aim to capture the audience’s attention and quickly convey the essence of the article (Org.Lett. Preparing Graphics, 2022). The Org.lett. journal welcomes creativity as long cultural sensitivity and pragmatism are ensured and graphics adhere to author guidelines; adopting forms of structures, graphs, drawings, photographs, or schemes, avoiding long sentences and minimising text when labelling compounds, reaction arrows, and diagrams (Org.Lett. Preparing Graphics, 2022) (Figure 1).

Table 3 shows GA frequency and characteristics in journals Org.Lett. and Chem. Chem GAs seem to incorporate a detailed textual description in the caption underneath the picture (Figure 2), whereas Org.Lett. GAs adhere to a style that incorporates bullet points (resembling a presentation slide) (Figure 1). Unlike journals in other disciplines (Yoon and Chung, 2017), these journals suggest that replication of images from the main manuscript is not recommended; this convention was adhered to in all papers. One-word or short-phrase bullet points highlighting key achievements or traits of research work are evident in nine out of twenty papers in Org.Lett. (Figure 1). Uncluttered images and graphics with a good text-image balance are also expected (Org.Lett. Preparing Graphics, 2022).

As a popular digital innovation in Elsevier, GAs follow a three-panel visual. Yet, in Chem, a multi-panel visual is merged into one to provide a key RA message very quickly and efficiently (Chem Authors, 2022), encouraging browsing, promoting interdisciplinary scholarship, and helping readers quickly identify the most relevant papers to their research interests (Chem GAGuidelines, 2022). Uniqueness and clarity, simplicity and succinctness are key features of a good GA while colour is used to direct the reader’s attention to focal points of interest (Chem GA Guidelines, 2022) (See more in S8). Author guidelines also provide examples of effective and poor GAs and accompanying text thus lending themselves to numerous pedagogical opportunities.

# 4.2. Contextual analysis

4.2.1. Perceived purpose, expected audience and usefulness

In questionnaires, all respondents viewed GAs in both journals as useful with high promotional value as they limit browsing time. Creativity, being able to “extract the main idea”, adequately ‘condense’ and remediate key points visually are considered predominant skills by professors. YR reported similar skills including critical thinking and knowledge of technical tools. They also mentioned that professors usually assign the creation of GAs to students.

Regarding the most useful visual, multimodal and textual innovations in digital papers in both journals, professors showed a preference towards a textual innovation i.e. the Bigger picture $( 8 0 \% )$ (Figure 3) and secondly the GA with $6 0 \%$ . Unlike professors, YRs fist preference was the GA. As seen in Figure 4, the Bigger picture and Research Highlights were also indicated as important digital features by YRs $( 7 1 . 4 \% )$ but not more important that the GA $( 8 5 . 7 \% )$ .

Which three features of the digital paper do you find most useful for your own work/research?

Table 4 summarises respondents’ views on GA in interviews. Professors verified GA improves paper visibility and helps readers decide whether the paper is relevant or of interest to them “at a glance”. Four out of ten though stated that they had never used it before and that they are not sure about its purposes other than its promotional value. As stated: “GA is [a] very important [.] eye-catching feature attracting your audience.” (FP5_I). Professors also explained the emergence of GA as a way of reaching out through social media to a wider audience due to competition: “Things are very competitive. If one publisher does something that attracts new readers, others want to copy them. It improves the papers’ quality and how useful or utilised they can be, all these features can be linked with social media they have metrics to judge how the journal is going. A lot of articles are twittered and get around many more people and I think it follows the way publishing is going. [.] They are taking practices that have already been used in newspapers, media and they have been adding them in scientific articles.” [FP6_I]. This response shows scholarly journals tendency to embrace social media audience engagement and recording practices (i.e. metrics).

YRs showed a preference to GA compared to other digital innovations and stressed on its important function of saving time when browsing for relevant research: “it is what I first notice and what makes me judge whether I want to keep on reading a paper or just discard it because it does not fit in well with my research” (YR_1_I]. They also drew upon GA’s provision of contextual information thus enhancing comprehension of the RA: “A GA is of great importance because it’s everything that is inside a written text with the format of just a picture and just by looking at it you can understand the context of what you are supposed to read.” [YR_2].

Students who composed GAs as an assignment justified task appropriateness and usefulness, verified its promotional purpose and strong contextual nature and its contribution to the overall understanding: “it’s important not for someone who writes the paper, but it’s important for the impact of the journal” [Stu_3_I]. However, students considered it as less important when compared to traditional part-genres e.g. abstract: “I think GA is useful enough but it is redundant because the summary/ abstract is there too. They are both condensed forms of the whole paper” [Stu_7_I].

# 4.3. Rhetorical analysis

As a relatively new genre for scientific publications (Hendges and Florek, 2019) but not new to Chemistry (Soldera, 2021), GAs do not just complement the main manuscript; they seem to strengthen its dialectical power as the paper gains more points for clarity, comprehensibility, originality and immediacy. Scholarly papers often incorporate GAs following author guidelines describing its scope either as a ‘teaser’ or an “integral part” of scholarly communication (ACS Style Guide, 2022). Their use often improves the effectiveness of data presentation, facilitates a better understanding of the key findings and/or increases the reader’s comprehension and immediate decision-making when viewing trends and relationships in the data such as relative proportions or magnitudes, highlight specific results with quantitative analysis and communicate target information more succinctly than in the main manuscript (ACS Style Guide, 2022).

Regarding images, GAs in Chem journal did not feature realistic pictures or photos but mostly abstract simulations of processing steps, routes, approaches or frameworks, bonding types, chemical structures, design, assembly pathways or apparatuses while only one GA $( \mathtt { n } = 1$ ) showed a realistic picture of a forest. Out of the 32 GAs summarising key findings in Chem, only four GAs $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 4 )$ showed spectra measurements with key evidence. In Org.Lett., however, twenty GAs represented the synthetic route or pathway discussed in the paper. As indicated in Table 5, GAs seem to summarise key findings or protocols used and they elucidate or promote research niche. In a very small number of papers $\mathbf { \dot { n } } = 9$ in Chem and $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 8$ in Org.Lett), GAs seem to draw on positive attributes or future applications.

4.3.1. Lexico-grammatical analysis in graphical abstract (Chem) and graphic (Org.Lett)

Although a lexico-grammatical analysis of GAs is not within the scope of this work, the examples provided in Tables S1 and S2 indicate authors’ tendency to provide overt interpretations of the visual input and promote research niche. They do so by combining subjective and objective units.

# 4.4. Multimodal analysis

Multimodal analysis examines text-visual interaction, complementarity, and status while briefly drawing on layout and originality and provide insights regarding discipline-specific visualisation tools, how textual information condenses visually (remediation) and visual literacy.

# 4.4.1. Text-visual interaction and status

Regarding multimodal analysis of the interaction between text and visuals, Table 6 informs us that online GAs in Chem precede the textual abstract whereas in Org.Lett they are embedded in the textual abstract denoting a more equal status. Table 6 also shows the interaction and status between visual and text; in Org.Lett., the equal status of most GAs and the semiotic interaction with the abstract are discernible by their similar positioning and space with only six $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = \boldsymbol { 6 } )$ out of forty $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 4 0 ,$ ) GAs in Org.Lett. that preceded the abstract. Regarding size, the textual abstract was bigger but overlaid within a blue background denoting that these two forms of abstracts, i.e. textual and visual, both serve the same purpose. Here, using bullet points as semiotic shortcuts allows the graphic to stand-alone as they include qualitative, quantitative, subjective and objective textual information units from the abstract denoting the importance of these textual units.

GAs complementarity and symbiotic relationship with the accompanying prose (Sancho Guinda, 2015) is also evident in its caption (in Chem) but there are size differences between online versions and downloadable pdf version; the size of the online GA is considerably larger than the abstract (here described as summary), whereas in the pdf downloadable version the reverse holds true. Regarding the order of appearance in both online html versions, the online GA in Chem precedes the abstract whilst GA succeeds abstracts in pdf versions, which may indicate that the visual elements are more important online. Chemistry professors (interview) confirmed the symbiotic nature of text and visuals putting the stress on GA significance as a promotional and navigational genre but they ranked it as less important than the textual abstract.

Table 6 Interaction and status in relation to the text in Chem $\mathrm { \Delta } \cdot { \mathrm { n } } = 4 0 \mathrm { \dot { \Omega } }$ ) and Org.Lett. $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 0 \right)$ ).   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Graphical Abstract Status and Interaction with Abstract</td><td>Frequency in journal Chem</td><td>Frequency in journal Org.Letters</td></tr><tr><td>Order_Precedes abstract</td><td> 40 in online version</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Order_Succeeds abstract</td><td> 39 in pdf download</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Order_In line with abstract</td><td></td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Size compared to abstract_smaller</td><td>[papers in online version ] 40</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Size compared to abstract_Bigger</td><td>[ 40 pdf download ] 40</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Size compared to abstract_similar</td><td>-</td><td>26</td></tr></table></body></html>

The GA in Chem also follows the Title but unlike the GA in Org.Lett., it is always positioned next to research highlights and before the abstract. This indicates that journals employ them as a means of facilitating quick browsing while summarising and emphasising key findings. Also, the GA in Chem is always complemented by a quite long explanatory caption (Figure 2) containing lexico-grammatical features that can be seen in Table S1. As observed, although evaluative language is not encouraged in author guidelines, it makes its way through to the caption (Table S1). Also, as seen in Figure 1 and Table S2, evaluative adjectives like ‘user-friendly’ or ‘superior’ and promotional verbs like ‘revealing’ and ‘solved’ seem to promote and disseminate the research niche in both journals.

4.4.1.1. Layout. Following Hendges and Florek (2019) analysis, I also examined discipline-internal regularities in layout, originality and nature of pictures. A useful taxonomy of stylisation with explicit visual literacy training potential for students and scholars, and a higher level of specification is discussed by Carmen Sancho Guinda (2022) but this was not used as it did not focus exclusively on the Chemistry discipline. Regarding layout design patterns in GAs (see Figure 5, adapted from Hullman and Bach, 2018), Chem GAs used a relatively small range including more linear visual routes (Top to bottom, Left to Right) (23), Circular (8), nesting (4) (see example in Fig. 2), forking ones (3) and centric (2). In Org.Lett., however, the graphic uses more linear (top-to-bottom and/or left to right) $( \mathtt { n } = 3 2$ ) (see example in Figure 1) or one-single panel images ${ \mathrm { ~ } } { \cdot } { \mathrm { ~ } } 1 = 8 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ . These variations did not seem to affect GA rhetorical functions.

4.4.1.2. Originality. Regarding contextual analysis of Chem corpus, original GAs were found in all primary research paper corpus $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 3 9 $ ) except one review paper $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 1$ ) which used a figure in the main manuscript in the online html version as a GA. In its downloadable pdf version, however, there was no GA and the Figure used as a GA was included in the main manuscript. Originality of Graphic was also evident in all Org.Lett. papers $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 4 \boldsymbol { 0 }$ ) as no other figures contained exactly the same content.

# 4.5. Pedagogical potential and perceived skills and challenges

4.5.1. Semiotic remediation as a key competence across data sets and users

Table 7 summarises skills and challenges reported in interviews, questionnaires and student think aloud reports. Professors consider excellent understanding of content and scientific protocol, and conciseness i.e. ability to design an image that condenses the main point visuallyessential and prominent skills for GA composition. Other skills include creativity and imagination, awareness of submission guidelines, software and discipline-specific visualisation tools, knowledge of discipline, creating eye-catching images, telling multimodal stories, using appropriate wording and simplicity.

4.5.1.1. Interviews. As stated by professors: “[we] use the data to tell a story. The story [we] compose shows knowledge, creativity, simplicity, it takes time. [.] [we] need to be familiar with specific programmes [and] tools.” [FP5_I]. Other professors described skills regarding users’ ability to communicate key RA themes visually and succinctly, and attract more readers: “It’s a promotional trick with more value because it is about attracting people to papers that are relevant to them and because the volume of journals is huge. [.] the GA is key to finding papers. [.] They are challenging because you [.] put as much information [.] but with as little words and little scheme as possible. To give an idea of the breadth of the paper [not just a reaction], again it comes back to distilling key information from the paper and help [readers] see the key points of the paper.” [FP7_I].

Despite the challenges, tasks were reported by learners to have fostered their critical skills: “As a student, [it] increase[d] my critical thinking, computer skills and graphics software.” [Stu_6_I]. Also, extracting appropriate information and presenting it to a scientific audience was perceived as an important skill by students composing GAs: “I had to notice and distinguish the important and not so important points in the text, you can’t just do it like this.” [Stu_7_I].

YRs reported similar skills: “picking the right amount of information, choos[ing ] everything that is important and leav [ing] out everything else [was very challenging] [YR6_I]. Herein, semiotic remediation was perceived as an attempt to condense the key message of the paper through an image and not text (See Think Aloud reports in S9) as very challenging. As well as being able to extract what’s important in the RA, a YR stated: “To find the key information, not to use too many words, use passive voice in a scheme, to know what the important themes are.” [YR7_I]. Avoiding certain lexical items like “proof’ and using appropriate grammar such as passive voice was stated as important when addressing experts in the field and when writing an accompanying caption (as it contains complete sentences not just key words).

4.5.1.2. Think aloud reports. Following student comparative analysis (Table 1) and according to Think aloud reports, the main purpose of a GA is mainly promotional increasing reader engagement and social media activity. GA status was perceived as complementary to the abstract or research highlights because one central image depicts visually either the main reaction or mechanism, or a major accomplishment or product of the paper. Relevant content in methods, results and discussion was identified in GA and students noticed that textual features are minimised and simplified when visual elements dominate. Their findings agree with analysis herein and other participants’ responses.

Think Aloud reports indicated that students looked for similar patterns across part-genres before GA composition; thus, mastering the skill of semiotic remediation for which reading comprehension and critical evaluation of key points are prerequisites. The composition of a GA shows that students do not just need to ‘read to write’ but they ‘read to design’. Students also regarded author guidelines and GA evaluation criteria peer-discussion before GA composition as very useful. They became aware of one single-panel pictures expected in Chem and linear graphics expected in Org.Lett. (See more about criteria and author guidelines by Jaleniauskiene and Katsampoxaki-Hodgetts, 2023).

Overall, in all datasets, skills required for GA composition include identifying the key message (inquiry, reading, noticing and critical thinking skills), depicting the key message visually (creativity, use of colour and contrast, effective use of software) and digital literacy skills (using arrows, labels and captions to establish spatial coherence, exclude redundant elements, combine textual and visual elements, capture readers’ attention).

# 4.5.2. Pedagogical potential of GAs

Interview responses indicate participants’ positive stance towards the pedagogical potential of GAs.

4.5.2.1. Professors. Reflecting on GAs’ pedagogical value, expected student competences included: “read[ing] and understand [ing] the paper before they design the GA and distill information” [FP7_I], giving the manuscript “the best visibility and presentation”, “find[ing] some way of promoting their work and persuad[ing] the audience that this is important” [FP5_I]. As reported, professors would assign GA composition as a task because students need to foster the skill of summarising key points visually, clearly indicating the pedagogical potential of multimodal genres in digital chemistry papers: “Relatively good students have difficulties putting together a nice abstract. The GA is similar [to] giv[ing] the essence of your work with a picture” [FP9_I]. Interestingly, transforming written information into visual information is not considered as more difficult than producing a written abstract by the professors interviewed but, as reported in the interviews, professors usually ask YRs to compose GAs.

4.5.2.2. Young researchers. Similarly, summarising and presenting key RA themes concisely were core skills. Awareness of context collapse issues was also shown: “definitely ask students to generate a GA as part of their training and [.] make it as friendly as possible for different target groups. Not just to scientists. But to inform the public, so to address both.” [YR2_1]. A key rhetorical function entails increasing social activity and engaging more readers tapping into imagination and creativity before assigning GA composition [YR4_I].

4.5.2.3. Students. Despite their concern regarding GA explicit lack of textual focus, most students acknowledged its value as a task. As stated, “it is not to do with scientific terms or vocabulary or processes [although] it is part of the paper [.] help[ing] the reader understand visually what the paper is about.” [Stu_7_I].

The pedagogical value of providing evaluation criteria such as author guidelines as a means of scaffolding student work was recognised by students: “I had to follow some specific criteria to do it right.learnt what I had to focus on.” [Stu_6_I]. Other students mentioned that fostering multimodal skills, creativity, critical and inquiry skills were deemed beneficial skills while challenges mainly included poor software and design skills.

# 5. Conclusions

As a visual genre, GAs serve as a very promising ground for semiotic remediation in scholarly RAs. GAs do not just complement the main manuscript; they seem to strengthen its dialectical power and add extra points regarding research clarity, comprehensibility, originality and immediacy. Data indicated that GAs cannot just be classed as promotional genres. GAs elucidate understanding of the RA’s key message by employing visual affordances that render the key message more succinct and potent. Although the sample of study is relatively small, the pedagogical potential of intentional semiotic remediations was confirmed by all participants.

Tasks were embedded within students’ learning experiences facilitating student agency i.e. agentic action (Hutchby, 2001; Miller and Shepherd, 2009) and critical reflection of their own semiotic remediated versions. Student agency and reflective opportunities can foster traditional, critical, visual and scientific literacy skills for the composition of GAs. As shown, visual and scientific literacy should not be explored as different entities; visual literacy can be integral in scholarly/scientific literacy. Mastering the skill of semiotic remediation depends on reading comprehension, critical evaluation of key points and awareness of scientific conventions. Traditional language learning notions such as appropriacy, accuracy, complexity and fluency can include multiliteracies including visual literacy. As explained below, the development of visual remediation skills should be reconsidered as a contributing factor of visual, academic, scientific and digital literacy.

# 5.1. Pedagogical potential of GA composition as a means of enhancing students’ visual literacy

Visual literacy incorporates visual thinking, i.e. “the ability to turn information of all types into pictures, graphics, or forms that help communicate the information” (Wileman, 1993, p. 114). Tasks migrated from ‘Writing to learn’ (Britton, 1980) to ‘designing to learn’ and ‘writing as multimodal composition’ processes, where students compared, deconstructed, designed, composed and reflected on remediated multimodal genres of scholarly Chemistry RA’s. GA composition skills were also developed through ‘reading-to-write’, ‘reading as viewing’ and ‘reading-to-design’ critical thinking skills that required remediating scientific input to composing visuals with key and concise scientific mechanisms or concepts (Table 7). As noted by participants, reading comprehension, critical evaluation of key points and awareness of scientific conventions are important conditions before mastering the skill of semiotic remediation. These skills were fostered as students migrated from language literacy towards the semiotic study of digital affordances in RAs, initially focussing mostly on textual modes (e.g. Research highlights) and then the visuals. This is in line with recent trends in social semiotic multimodality in both discourse analysis (Jewitt and O’Halloran, 2004) and educational research (De Silva and Feez, 2018; Unsworth et al., 2019; Jaleniauskiene and Katsampoxaki-Hodgetts, 2023).

Engagement in critical reflection and expert, peer, self evaluation of GAs within a collaborative learning environment encouraged self-awareness and awareness of discipline-specific epistemologies, language, norms, skills and challenges (Table 7); hence, contributing to the development of multiliteracies by composing, performing and “strongly focus[ing] on competencies and written lettered representation” (Jewitt, 2007, p. 245). Although it was deemed challenging, working towards co-deploying how semiotic resources can visually relay appropriate information in the text, and ‘designing to learn’ processes were attested by students (S9) as beneficial (Table 4).

Combining verbal and non-verbal (visual) modes allowed for the development of remediation skills that are not just visual, but also academic, scientific, digital and socio-cultural. Developing skills that go beyond knowledge of specific lexis, textual analysis, contextual rhetorical moves and cultural accommodation is crucial. Johns (2015) defines genre awareness as “rhetorical flexibility necessary for adapting their previously held socio-cognitive genre knowledge (“schemas”) to everevolving contexts” (116). Johns’ genre awareness definition can be expanded to include multimodal production, adaptation and remediation as core skills; ‘multi-literacies’ promoting ‘understanding and competent control of representational forms [.] are becoming increasingly significant in the overall communications environment, such as visual images and their relationship to the written word – for instance, visual design in desktop publishing or the interface of visual and linguistic meaning in multimedia’ (New London Group, 1996, p. 61). Further discussion of the pedagogical implications of digital RAs (Hafner and Miller, 2019; Lillis and Tuck, 2016). Hafner (2018, p. 38) succinctly examines multimodality and suggests ESAP practitioners learn to construct digital multimodal genre as current academic communication clearly extends beyond writing skills and asks for collaborative construction of visuals or technically demanding media that require skills such as filming, editing as well as soft skills such as collaboration and adaptability. Bridging linguistic, rhetorical and multimodal traditions in discipline specific genres, ESAP practitioners can gradually move beyond a ‘linear transmission pedagogy’ (Cope and Kalantzis, 2015) and engage learners into multimodal production (Hafner and Miller, 2019, p. 154) while prioritising ‘visibility’ (Hyland, 2015), explicit and implicit deconstruction of exemplary genre use, and consciousness-raising of agreed scientific and research conventions among established members of a discourse community (Swales, 2004).

5.2. Pedagogical implications for visually-literate material and curriculum design

New ESAP materials should use appropriate scaffolding or metalanguage (Lim, 2018) and technology to foster student participation in multimodal meaning-making processes (Lombardi, 2018, p. 15–16). To facilitate student awareness and informed practice, materials should include opportunities for students to interpret the visuals, identify their purpose, deconstruct them and compose better ones after restructuring, resizing and remediating visuals for deeper meaning-making. Multimodal compositions skills are often viewed as a meta-literacy (Mackey and Jacobson, 2014) where students can act as ‘prosumers’ (Anderson, 2003) and ‘co-creators of knowledge’ (Dawson et al., 2014) taking ownership of their learning. Hafner and Miller (2019, p. 162–167) suggest a three-step “process-oriented genre-based approach” for embedding digital literacies in ESAP curricula, including: (1) identifying authentic genres and practices, (2) examining the role of multimodality and digital tools, and (3) designing tasks and materials. This study followed this model and showed that through intentional process-based instructional activities, students became aware of semiotic remediation as the ability to read, understand, interpret and present information in pictorial or graphic images.

# 5.3. Limitations of study and recommendations for further research

Limitations in this study include a relatively small sample size focusing only on Chemistry discourse which prevented generalised conclusions. Yet, unexplored questions herein may provide room for further research; more specifically, we can examine how involvement of content teachers in the evaluation of student compositions can shed more light regarding multimodal remediation skills and practices, and how students’ metacognitive awareness levels could also be compared to the quality of their work in collaboration with content teachers. Also, analysing process-based remediation skills as appropriate situated practice could be another area to be explored.

Most importantly, researchers in collaboration with practitioners could be utilising the voice of students as experts-in-themaking to co-create tasks/materials and to define criteria or codification tools for multimodal composition.
