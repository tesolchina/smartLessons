Abstract Peer tutors’ behaviour has been stated to have the power to create and increase learning opportunities within peer tutoring programs. However, previous studies have shown that peer tutors struggle to adopt facilitative and constructivist-oriented strategies, as they lean more towards directive and knowledge-telling strategies. This study aims to explore a typology of approaches to peer tutoring by unraveling peer tutors’ behavioural strategies and related approaches. Furthermore, it aims to grasp peer tutors’ behavioural repertoire in-depth by shedding light on the concerns and challenges they experience while tutoring. Results showed that peer tutors used a variety of strategies but were mainly inclined to adopt answering and directive actions. Their questioning behaviour remained relatively low level in terms of quality. Moreover, three types of peer tutors could be discerned, i.e. questioners, informers and motivational organisers. Finally, although all peer tutors reported diverse organisational, social and didactical concerns and challenges, results showed that different types of tutors struggled with different approach-specific issues and experienced tutoring in a slightly different manner. Taking these issues into account seems crucial for peer tutoring to reach its potential. Implications for peer tutoring programs and training of peer tutors are discussed.

Keywords Peer-assisted learning $\cdot$ Approaches to peer tutoring $\cdot$ Typology $\cdot$ Peer tutors experiences $\cdot$ Mixed methods research

Many educators have started to implement diverse social-constructivist-inspired learning environments, which assign a heightened degree of educational responsibility to students. Among others, an increased interest in peer-assisted learning (PAL) has occurred. PAL is considered to be an umbrella concept comprising ‘(…) a group of strategies that involve the active and interactive mediation of learning through other learners who are not professional teachers’. (Topping and Ehly 2001, p. 113). Peer tutoring is one of the most implemented formats of PAL. Its distinctive features concern the focus on curriculum content and the specific roles taken by peer tutors and tutees (Topping 1996). There is ample evidence available in different areas that PAL is as effective as instructor-led sessions (e.g. Haist et al. 1997; Weidner and Popp 2007). Besides cognitive gains, increases in learning transfer and student involvement have been reported (e.g. Falchikov 2001; Santee and Garavalia 2006; Topping 1996). PAL appears to create a safe learning environment with lower thresholds, as such stimulating students’ self-confidence and lowering their anxiety (e.g. Fantuzzo et al. 1989; Weidner and Popp 2007). Moreover, students not only gain in many ways from learning with peers, they also value this type of learning (Secomb 2007).

# Effect studies

While effect studies tend to dominate the research field, process-oriented studies are less prevalent (Roscoe and Chi 2007). However, we cannot claim that implementing PAL will have a beneficial effect in itself since PAL does not always operate as intended or lead to the required results (e.g. Capstick and Fleming 2004). Ashwin (2003) found for example that the quality of learning dropped as students tended to act more strategically as a result of their attendance at peer support sessions. Over the years, the idea has been postulated that it is not so much as the socialconstructivist learning environment, such as PAL, that fosters or inhibits students’ learning, but the interactions occurring within this learning environment. Different kinds of interaction do promote different kinds of learning (King 1999). For instance, Roscoe and Chi (2007) and Chi et al. (2001) claim that some of the variation and ambiguity in tutoring outcomes can be attributed to the actual strategies that peer tutors adopt while tutoring. Graesser et al. (1995) indicate that it is not so much tutors’ expertise or experience that drives learning, but the interactional patterns that occur during tutoring. More specifically, a question–response dialogue was found to be more beneficial for students’ performance than tutor’s use of directives (Sorsana 2005 in Olry-Louis 2009). Studies in the context of approaches to teaching support this as they showed that the approaches to teaching adopted by educators strongly influence students’ approaches to learning (e.g. Trigwell et al. 1999). Although there is ample descriptive literature about the different roles and responsibilities of peer tutors (e.g. McLuckie and Topping 2004), a limited number of studies has adopted a thorough approach to the investigation of peer tutors’ behaviour. An additional complexity results from the fact that the vast majority of peer tutors are generally unskilled or do not have a lot of didactical experience (Chi et al. 2005). However, if effective learning is to result from peer tutoring, high-quality interactions need to be established (Webb and Mastergeorge 2003). Thus the question arises whether unskilled peer tutors are capable of adopting high-quality strategies that constitute effective interaction.

# Tutoring strategies and actions of peer tutors

Peer tutors are required to perform a complex spectrum of diverse activities, such as explaining, questioning and assessing (Roscoe and Chi 2007). In general, scaffolding the learning process of fellow students becomes one of tutor’s main responsibilities. Scaffolding has been defined as assisting other learners within their zone of proximal development in attaining a higher level of development (Masters and Yelland 2002). Investigating the scaffolding behaviour of peer tutors, Graesser et al. (1995) concluded that peer tutors tended to steer the tutoring sessions rather than that they acted from a student-activating perspective. They rarely managed to stimulate deep-level reasoning, neither did they monitor or test students’ understanding by questioning or confronting them with new examples (Graesser et al. 1995; Roscoe and Chi 2007). These findings are corroborated by a study by De Smet et al. (2008) who found a high proportion of exchanging information by peer tutors. Tutors supplied students with specific solutions, explained certain concepts or gave their personal opinion. Furthermore, no significant evolution was found from introductory or social talk to contributions eliciting cognitive processing and critical thinking in the course of the sessions.

More specifically, scaffolding implies effective questioning behaviour. Previous research has created a pessimistic picture, stating that peer tutors place minimal demands on students while questioning (Graesser et al. 1995). High-quality questions (i.e. Socratic questioning) were lacking, as well as questions of a sufficient level of specificity (Graesser and Person 1994). Roscoe and Chi’s (2007) study supported these findings by adding that peer tutors’ questions tended to prompt more for knowledge-telling than for knowledge-building, even when peer tutors were trained. In addition, tutors do not only question students, they also engage in explaining. In this respect, a predominance of peer tutors is reported as they were found to do the bulk of explaining while tutoring (King 1997). Their explanations proved to be barely interactive. They were more focused on delivering content didactically and explicating the required knowledge than on being responsive to the confusion or specific need for explanation exhibited by students (Chi et al. 2001).

The above literature overview generates the question whether it is feasible to expect high quality didactical strategies from students acting as peer tutors. This question becomes even more crucial when one considers that even teachers, who build on years of experience and training, do not always manage to approach their teaching in a highly qualitative pedagogical manner or report related struggles (e.g. Graesser and Person 1994; Graesser et al. 1996; Webb and Mastergeorge 2003).

# Present study

As teachers develop their own teaching (e.g. Kember and Kwan 2000), and students their own learning (e.g. Entwistle et al. 2001) approach, it is likely that peer tutors also develop their own specific approach to peer tutoring. Despite the interest in tutor styles and approaches in general (e.g. Pata et al. 2005; Rosé et al. 2001), specific research on peer tutor’s tutoring approaches remains rather limited. An exception is the empirical work of De Smet et al. (2008) who generated evidence for the existence of three types of peer tutors within the context of online peer tutoring using the e-moderating framework of Salmon (2000), i.e. access and motivation, online socialisation, information exchange, knowledge construction, and personal development. While ‘motivators’ were focused on stimulating and motivating students to participate, ‘informers’ tended to be merely transmitting and illustrating knowledge. ‘Knowledge constructors’ were more concentrated on stimulating and facilitating tutees’ learning, and allocated a greater responsibility to tutees. This study aims to explore whether it is possible to discern a similar typology in a face-to-face peer tutoring setting. Furthermore, over the years, more educational studies have started to explore the thoughts and concerns of educators while educating in order to grasp their educational actions. The current study builds further on this trend by not only shedding light on the behavioural strategies and approaches to tutoring adopted by unskilled tutors, but also by aiming to understand the motives and concerns that support tutors’ tendencies to rely on certain strategies and to avoid others. Particularly in the specific context of peer tutoring, it is not unlikely that peer tutors, who are novices, experience various insecurities and concerns about their role. Moreover, it was found that some untrained tutors did manage to spontaneously adopt knowledge-building activities (Roscoe and Chi 2007). Understanding the rationale that motivates both those tutors who manage to naturally engage in cognitivedemanding tutoring behaviour and those tutors who fail to do so, may reinforce the design of effective training and coaching programs for peer tutors.

Accordingly, the present study focuses on the following research questions.

1. Which approaches to tutoring and related behavioural strategies can be discerned among peer tutors?   
2. Which challenges and concerns underlie peer tutors’ approaches to tutoring and related behavioural strategies?

# Methodology

Setting

An empirical case study was set up in a naturalistic peer tutoring setting. Within the scope of their tutorial services, the Faculty of Science of the University of Leuven organises multiple sessions on a weekly basis for different courses each semester, in which more advanced students act as peer tutors for first year students (i.e. tutees). The tutoring sessions last $1 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ and are voluntarily organised after regular class time. In general, there is a participation rate of 20 to 25 tutees per session. More specifically, tutees carry out exercises in small peer groups of approximately five tutees while being supported by peer tutors. Depending on the number of enrolled tutees, two or three peer tutors are present in each session.

Naturalistic design

This study took place during two consecutive academic years and followed 14 peer tutors during their tutoring activities. Peer tutors were older year students from the second and third year of the Bachelor program in Science. They were responsible for tutoring the compulsory freshman mathematical course Analysis I, which aimed for mathematical reasoning. Although a script was developed by the faculty on the basis of the course book indicating which chapters needed to be discussed in each session, peer tutors were given a great deal of freedom in designing the conduct of the sessions. This programme was rather closely followed by peer tutors since this generated clear goals and objectives for each session. Also tutored students appreciated this script as this yielded specific information on what to expect from every session in terms of chapters or content that would be discussed.

To ensure high-quality tutoring, a training programme was organised, which entailed three parts. A first part concerned a 1.5-h lasting formal training in which the goals of the tutoring sessions were presented, and useful tutoring strategies were discussed. A video on good tutoring practices visualised the strategies that were expected from peer tutors. More specifically, peer tutors were encouraged to adopt facilitative strategies, such as asking questions and giving hints, and were asked to stimulate tutees to take responsibility for their learning. They were encouraged to promote knowledge construction and deep-level learning among tutees. These strategies were practiced through role play after which feedback was given. The second part of the training focused on the course content by means of a meeting with the lecturer of the course in which the learning goals and specific course content were discussed in detail. The third and final part of the training concerned a feedback session in which peer tutors could discuss their tutoring experiences and challenges with the coordinator, both individually and in group. In addition, peer tutors received a manual which elaborated their role and responsibilities, listed general tips and guidelines, and exemplified more specific types of questions and other related didactic strategies.

Mixed method study

As this study not only aimed to shed light on peer tutors’ behavioural repertoire while tutoring, but also intended to grasp the rationale behind these behavioural strategies, a mixed methods approach was chosen. In this approach, which is often referred to as the third research paradigm (Johnson et al. 2007), both quantitative and qualitative data are collected and analysed as such, as the combination of both approaches provides a better understanding of the research problem at hand than either approach alone (Creswell and Plano Clark 2011). In what follows, an overview is presented of the collection and analysis of both observational and interview data.

Observational data To gain insight into the behavioural repertoire of peer tutors, random video-observations were conducted. In total, $3 4 . 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ of data were generated, transcribed and subsequently analysed. In order to obtain a fine-grained view of the interaction and learning processes occurring, researchers turned to content analysis (De Wever et al. 2006). This technique builds on procedures that ‘(…) make valid inferences from text (…), [which] culminates in descriptive or inferential conclusions about the target variable’. (Anderson et al. 2001, p. 10). More specifically, the qualitative variant of content analysis was chosen in this study (Morgan 1993). This variant uses the data as a source for coding, which results in coding categories that represent the specificity of the data. Moreover, qualitative content analysis generates numerical results, which mainly present a basis for the further examination of the data in order to produce a theory that explains why these patterns occur (Morgan 1993).

Coding scheme To analyse peer tutors’ actions, a coding scheme was developed based on a thorough literature review (e.g. Graesser et al. 1995; King 1999; De Smet et al. 2008, 2009; Roscoe and Chi 2007; Van Keer 2004). Subsequently, this scheme was tested in two pilot studies (Symons 2010; Berghmans et al. 2010) and refined afterwards in order to embrace the data. This procedure led to the final scheme, which comprised six categories of tutor strategies: structural–organisational support, social–motivational support, answering and directive behaviour, questioning and facilitative behaviour, strategic support, and a rest category of indefinable actions. Every category comprised specific subcategories as well as a category-specific rest category to comprise units that could be categorised in one of the five main categories but failed to find their place in one of the subcategories.

Coding procedure In order to meet standards of quality and reliability, a clear and transparent coding procedure was developed. First, the transcripts were segmented into units of analysis before the coding and content analysis were undertaken (Strijbos et al. 2006). Rourke et al. (2001) state that working with complete messages forms the most objective segmentation method since this creates units which are in fact defined by the authors of the messages themselves. In this study, every tutor’s message that was not meaningfully interrupted by others was seen as a unit of analysis. A such, a unit could be either a single word or could comprise several sentences. In total, 2,227 units were distinguished. The next step involved coding the units by means of NVivo8 software. Since units could comprise several sentences and therefore diverse actions, multiple coding per unit was possible. Every unit could, however, only receive a certain coding category once. Finally, frequency scores were calculated, i.e. the number of specific coding per category related to the total number of codings assigned.

Two coders were assigned to code the transcripts. Both coders already had experience with the coding scheme since they were involved in the two related pilot studies (Berghmans et al. 2010). To get acquainted with the final coding scheme, a 3-h training session was organised in which coders explored the coding scheme together and coded an entire session through discussion. After this training, both coders individually coded a selection of $1 5 \%$ of the total sample of units. This was followed by a discussion meeting in which coding was compared and discussed in-depth. If necessary, nodes were redefined and/or added, both to capture the data and to align both coders in terms of coding. Subsequently, this procedure of intersubjective coding agreement was resumed during the rest of the coding. While both coders coded the units first independently, secondly they met at weekly coding meetings to discuss all codings in order to result in unanimous agreement on coding. As a result, this procedure, which is common in qualitative research (Armstrong et al. 1997), guaranteed a high level of inter-rater reliability.

Analysis In order to explore the occurrence of approaches to tutoring, cluster analyses were performed. This technique aims to classify cases into groups that are relatively homogeneous within themselves while being heterogeneous to each other (Sharma 1996). It makes use of a set of variables to decide on (dis-)similarity and to assign cluster membership to cases. In this instance, an exploratory hierarchical cluster analysis was performed, supplemented by a K-means cluster analysis to investigate whether a similar cluster solution could be found (Garson 2010). The five main behavioural coding categories were included as variables on the basis of which the clustering was executed.

Interviews In order to explain peer tutors’ behaviour and adopted strategies, semi-structured interviews were administered to nine peer tutors.

Interview protocol An interview protocol based on a literature review (e.g. De Smet et al. 2010b; Loke and Chow 2007; Mynard and Almarzouqi 2006; Schramm et al. 2009; Solomon and Crowe 2001) was developed to ensure that a diverse spectrum of experiences was covered, i.e. organisational aspects, session content, interactions with tutees, the actions and approach to tutoring adopted, as well as tutors’ beliefs and expectations of tutoring, their motivation and experienced challenges while tutoring. Some exemplary questions are ‘According to you, what are the goals of the tutoring sessions?’, ‘Which strategies did you adopt while tutoring?’, ‘Why did you choose to adopt these specific strategies’, and ‘Which challenges did you encounter while tutoring?’. The semi-structured character of the interviews allowed a focus on various topics while the flexibility to go deeper into the story of the interviewees was preserved (Cohen et al. 2007).

Coding scheme and analysis All data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo8 software. First, all interviews were read and categorised in thematic paragraphs. Subsequently, these units of analysis were coded by means of the coding scheme. An initial coding scheme was developed on the basis of the interview protocol and its underlying literature. However, nodes were added when the specific data asked for an extension or refinement of the initial node structure. Hence, both a theory- and data-driven approach were used.

# Results

Peer tutors’ behaviour

Since this study dealt with meaningful actions of peer tutors, the sixth category which comprised indefinable units was not admitted in the calculation of frequencies. A total of 2,388 codings from 14 tutors was taken up.

The vast majority of tutors’ actions in general concerned giving answers or explicit directions $( 4 5 . 3 1 \ \% )$ . These answering and directive strategies could be mainly typed both as deep level, as peer tutors tended to elaborate on, and explain their answers, and as of a general-level, i.e. informative without providing an extensive elaboration. Superficial-level answers, which were limited to basic confirmation or judging the (in-)correctness of tutees’ reasoning without further feedback, occurred less often, although they were still prevalent in $9 . 7 6 ~ \%$ of the time. In contrast to this large number of directive actions, $1 9 . 4 4 \ \%$ of actions were labelled as questioning or facilitative behaviour. The main questions concerned general process-supportive questions $( 8 . 2 4 ~ \% )$ , which guided tutees in their reasoning process and led them in the right direction. Deep-level learning questions, which stimulated tutees to think about explanations or to presume a critical view, were only present in $3 . 7 9 \ \%$ of the observed actions. While hinting $( 3 . 1 0 ~ \% )$ or probing $( 2 . 1 5 ~ \% )$ questions occurred less often, metacognitive questions were practically non-existing $( 0 . 0 7 ~ \% )$ . Furthermore, $1 3 . 9 5 \ \%$ of coding concerned structural–organisational actions. While the vast majority of these actions were undertaken in order to clarify issues $( 7 . 9 2 ~ \% )$ , planning $( 1 . 8 4 ~ \% )$ and moderating $( 2 . 7 5 ~ \% )$ actions covered relatively less of peer tutors’ actions. Social and motivational strategies accounted for $1 9 . 2 1 \ \mathrm { ~ \% ~ }$ of peer tutors’ behavioural actions. Although signs of active listening behaviour were most frequently observed $( 6 . 3 9 ~ \% )$ , making informal comments and jokes $( 3 . 4 5 ~ \% )$ , checking if all the tutees understood $( 3 . 2 5 ~ \% )$ ) and motivating tutees $( 2 . 2 6 ~ \% )$ were also observable. Despite this having been widely reported to be a specific asset of peer tutoring, tutors did not often share their own experiences with tutees $( 0 . 8 2 ~ \% )$ . Finally, strategic actions in terms of giving tips and tricks were least represented $( 2 . 0 9 ~ \% )$ (Table 1).

However, since an exploratory look at the descriptive results for every peer tutor individually suggests that interindividual differences in the behavioural repertoire of peer tutors exist, an indepth investigation of peer tutor-dependent approaches to tutoring is urged. First, the hierarchical cluster technique was applied. Both the dendogram and the increase of the distance coefficients in the agglomeration matrix supported a three-cluster solution. Except for strategic actions, the four main behavioural categories allowed for significant discrimination between clusters. Subsequently, a K-means analysis was performed, which proposed a three-cluster solution beforehand based on both the hierarchical three-cluster solution and the three-cluster typology of De Smet et al. (2008).

Although the descriptive results of the behavioural classification measures per cluster suggested meaningful clusters and generated an insight into the particular actions adopted by every cluster, multivariate analyses of variance were performed in order to test the differences between the three clusters in terms of the five behavioural classification measures. Using Wilks’ lambda criterion, a significant cluster effect was found, $F ( 1 0 , \ 1 4 ) = 3 . 9 3 2$ , $\scriptstyle p = 0 . 0 1 0$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 7 3 7$ . The partial squared eta measures showed that the clusters mainly explained the proportion of answering and directive behaviour $( 7 1 . 2 \% )$ and questioning and facilitative behaviour $( 6 4 . 0 \% )$ . Concerning the proportion of social–motivational $( 5 5 . 8 ~ \% )$ and structural–organisational $( 4 9 . 6 ~ \%$ behaviour, the explanatory power was relatively smaller though still significant. Only strategic actions turned out to be not significantly different between the three clusters (Table 2).

Bonferroni analyses were performed to test the behavioural differences between the three cluster groups in detail (Table 3). Both questioning and facilitative actions (i.e. cluster 1) and answering and directive behaviour (i.e. cluster 2) were cluster-unique features. Structural– organisational and social–motivational support turned out to be also cluster unique (i.e. cluster 3) but to a more limited extent since clusters 1 and 2 also partly comprised respectively structural–organisational and social–motivational strategies (Table 3).

Fig. 1 Mean scores of the five behavioural measures

Of the tutors, $2 8 . 5 7 \ \%$ $( n { = } 4 )$ could be labelled as ‘questioners’. This first group of peer tutors turned out to be mainly focused on questioning tutees, i.e. stimulating them to think for themselves while supporting them by means of questions. The second cluster comprised also $2 8 . 5 7 \%$ of the tutors $( n { = } 4 )$ and could be typed as ‘informers’. These peer tutors mainly gave information and steered tutees in a directive manner by providing specific answers to their questions. Finally, the third cluster comprised the majority of tutors $( n { = } 6 , 4 2 . 8 6 \ \% )$ , ‘motivational organisers’. These peer tutors were combining structural–organisational strategies with giving social–motivational support in order to safeguard the social and informal atmosphere (Fig. 1).

# Challenges and concerns experienced by peer tutors

The second goal of this study was to grasp the rationale behind the aforementioned behavioural tendencies and tutor-specific approaches. Below, an overview of peer tutors’ experienced challenges is presented, which can be defined as didactical, organisational, and social in essence. Besides paying attention to cluster-specific nuances, the following paragraph also includes peer tutors’ quotes to exemplify some of the main challenges reported. Moreover, attention is paid to diverse features on the level of the tutee, peer tutor and context that were reported to underlie the four main challenges. An overview of all challenges and underlying features is provided in Table 4.

Defining and planning interventions The foremost challenge reported by peer tutors concerned intervening. Knowing what to ask and deciding on which questions or hints were good enough to stimulate tutees towards the right path of reasoning were experienced as difficult. In addition, not only deciding on how to intervene but also when to intervene was experienced as difficult. ‘It sometimes happened that I intervened when it was not necessary. The tutees had not even start thinking or they were just processing information. (…) I shouldn’t have disturbed their thinking by intervening’. (motivational organiser A). In other words, finding a balance between respecting tutees’ initiative and appealing to their responsibility for their own learning on the one hand, and giving input and direction on the other hand, was experienced as a learning process.

Although peer tutors mentioned that the specificity of Analysis I (i.e. aiming for mathematical reasoning) asked for a questioning approach, adopting facilitative strategies was especially difficult when tutees were stuck or did not know the answer or how to proceed. ‘When I noticed that tutees had not made any progress (…), you are just standing there, feeling the tendency to intervene and to give them something.’ (Questioner A). In this respect, also tutees’ lack of preparation was mentioned as hindering tutors’ interventions. Although both ‘questioners’ and ‘informers’ elaborated on this, ‘questioners’ in particular stressed the importance of tutees’ preparation. Ill-prepared tutees made it harder to execute their facilitative questioning approach, since it was difficult to ask questions when tutees had no background information or did not understand where this questioning would lead to, i.e. ‘You cannot get something out of them if it is not there’. (Questioner B). In addition, only this group of ‘questioners’ made a cluster-specific reflection on the influence of tutees’ questions on their tutoring actions. It seems that the behavioural strategies and general approach to tutoring of the ‘questioners’ were more susceptible to the type of questions posed by tutees.

If it concerns a definition or meaning of a concept (…), I might as well just give them the information. (…) If it concerns a more complex problem, you can start thinking of asking certain questions, but the difficulty is knowing what the right way to go is before you even can start thinking of questions. (Questioner B)

On the other hand, tutors also acknowledged their part in the challenges experienced with respect to interventions. Their own lack of ready knowledge made it harder to define interventions and to come up with specific questions or prompts. ‘Some course content we still use a lot, but some more complex content we don’t use that often. There are times that you really need to think hard’what was that or how did that go again’. (motivational organiser B). In addition, as facilitative questioning strategies demanded high cognitive processing of peer tutors, these strategies were also reported by these peer tutors to depend on peer tutor’s mood and concentration.

In some sessions, you can be really concentrated in asking good questions or providing challenging prompts, but some days you are just tired and then it is challenging [not to give them promptly the answers they want]. (Questioner A)

Furthermore, an automatism or general inclination to certain strategies, which resulted from personal beliefs about tutoring, as well as prior tutoring experiences in the personal sphere were also reported to be responsible for adopting some strategies and avoiding others. While this made some peer tutors act from a self-evident ‘question–answer’ perspective, in which tutees’ questions were immediately provided with a specific answer, for others this meant that they were inclined to ask questions and to adopt facilitative tutoring strategies. ‘I really would not have liked it when I would just have given them the answers or provided them with cut-and-dried directions since I personally feel that PAL would have missed its effect in these cases’. (questioner B).

Finally, also context-related features challenged peer tutors’ interventions tactics. For example, ‘questioners’ added that the course content became more difficult throughout the semester, which generated more complex questions and discussions, and in turn higher tutoring demands. ‘The last sessions the course content became more difficult, so at some points we had to be more directive (…) since students had no clue’. (questioner B). For the group of ‘motivational organisers in particular, the tight teaching schedule of the didactical team boosted pressure on them. More specifically, a lot of issues needed to be covered in time, which induced content and time pressures and resulted in consequences for their tutoring actions (i.e. limited time spent on certain issues, tutors’ preparation). Nevertheless, all peer tutors reported that the specificity of the course in general asked for more facilitative strategies, in order for students to be well-prepared for mathematical reasoning.

Dealing with tutees’ heterogeneity A second tutor challenge was generated by the diversity among tutees, who had different kinds of questions or struggled with different contentrelated issues at different paces. Finding a format and an agenda that worked for all tutees, i.e. differentiating, was perceived to be a major challenge. Furthermore, differences in abilities of tutees were also a matter of concern, although the different types of tutors held dissenting views on this. ‘Questioners’ in particular experienced difficulty in asking good questions or generating specific hints when interacting with low-ability tutees. ‘If they failed to answer my questions or failed to understand where I wanted to go with my questions or hints, I didn’t know what to ask anymore’. (questioner B). In contrast, one of the ‘motivational organisers’ stated that he liked working with low-ability tutees. ‘With low-ability tutees, I see myself more as a coach (…). I believe that I know enough to keep my distance as a coach, to feel for their problems and to provide immediate support’. (motivational organiser A).

With regard to stimulating tutees to think more critically, many peer tutors stated that this also depended on tutees’ ability level. They mainly confronted high-ability tutees with deeplevel questioning actions and spared low-ability tutees, believing it would be too much for them to handle. However, high-ability tutees were not trouble-free either, as they placed higher demands on peer tutors’ cognitive reasoning and questioning due to their sophisticated questions. “When high-ability students start thinking, it am like ‘oh oh’. Then you are forced to start thinking hard”. (motivational organiser A).

On the other hand, peer tutors’ familiarity with tutees in terms of knowing their abilities and personalities was mentioned as helping peer tutors to adapt their tutoring strategies to the different tutees in the peer group. Both ‘questioners’ and ‘motivational organisers’ reported this as being a positive aspect of familiarity. ‘Knowing which questions to ask specifically is a difficult call, but after some time you start the know the tutees, which makes it easier to decide on’. (motivational organiser B).

Structural–organisational challenges All tutors reported context-related features as generating diverse organisational challenges. For instance, while small groups allowed to followup discussions and monitor tutees’ progress more easily, and thus to differentiate between tutees, a potential pitfall concerned a loss of oversight of the tutoring session. Compared with whole-class tutoring, the choice of working in diverse subgroups made it more difficult to know exactly which groups were working on which topic since peer tutors could not be omnipresent. Moreover, switching between subgroups made tutors’ interventions more stressful, as they had to work up the reasoning process every time they moved to another group.

I prefer that one tutor is involved with one small group so that he or she gets immediately what that group is exactly doing. In any case, it asks some time to figure out what they have already been doing or where they’re at that certain point (motivational organiser D).

Also, the number of peer tutors assigned to one session induced an organisational challenge in terms of ensuring efficient communication and alignment between tutors. Interestingly, the importance of efficient communication and alignment was only expressed by ‘motivational organisers’.

I think it would be better if tutors communicated more with each other beforehand. (…) Being on the same line and tuning one’s ideas or contributions to one another is crucial. (…) This remains a point of attention. (motivational organiser E).

Furthermore, it was mainly this latter group who reported struggling with various organisational issues, while the other two groups of tutors mentioned these concerns mere briefly or not at all. Starting the session efficiently, keeping track of time and organising closure of the sessions were things they felt they needed to work on, as well as creating more didactical variety. ‘I would like to come up with alternatives for regular exercises, such as creating a game or quiz or something like that’. (motivational organiser A). Although the previous paragraph showed that this group acknowledged the benefits of familiarity with tutees in regards to differentiating, ‘motivational organisers’ also showed an awareness of the downside of this familiarity, i.e. being inclined to go more often to students you know or are familiar with and, as such, endangering a good follow-up of all students.

One point of attention is that I, maybe unconsciously, sometimes went too much to the same students, but that evolves from the fact that you start to know these students and more often end up with them. That is of course something that we need to avoid doing (motivational organiser C).

Group dynamics and expectations A final category of challenges concerned managing and dealing with group dynamics and expectations of tutees. For instance, peer tutors found it difficult to maintain or preserve order in the group when tutoring, i.e. telling tutees to go back to work or making negative remarks on their attitudes. A motivational organiser stated “I just don’t find it my place to say that they have to work (…), to say from my position ‘come on guys, start working’”. (informer A). The role of peer tutor brought with it a double status, as it placed students on both sides of the educational environment, i.e. teaching or tutoring as a tutor and being a student themselves.

It is the world upside down. You are used to sitting in the classroom as a student while listening to the professor, but now you are on the other side of the story and that is a rather challenging experience. (informer A).

Furthermore, tutees’ expectations and attitudes had the potential to put pressure on tutors’ tactics and caused tutors to adopt certain strategies. ‘Informers’ mentioned that some tutees had specific expectations, i.e. getting verification of their answers and reasoning. ‘Some students really wanted me to explain things to them’. (informer A). ‘Motivational organisers’, on the other hand, experienced this mainly in terms of tutees’ critical attitudes and unwillingness to accept peer tutor’s authority or expertise. ‘Some students gave me the feeling ‘What are you doing here’, as if they distrusted me or perceived me as arrogant for adopting this role of tutor. These were mainly high-ability students’. (Motivational organiser B).

To summarise, the aforementioned paragraph presented a typology of three clusters of peer tutors, i.e. ‘questioners’, ‘informers’ and ‘motivational organisers’, on the basis of four distinctive behavioural measures. Furthermore, four main challenges were reported, of which some were more pronounced for certain clusters of peer tutors, i.e. defining and planning interventions, dealing with tutees’ heterogeneity, structural-organisation challenges, and group dynamics and expectations. In the next paragraph, these main results and conclusions will be discussed more in-depth.

# Conclusions and discussion

In an effort to explain the mechanisms responsible for the success of peer tutoring, this study aimed to portray the tutoring behaviour of peer tutors, while exploring the existence of a typology of approaches to peer tutoring. Results showed that although peer tutors tended to use a wide variety of strategies, they turned out to be far more inclined to adopt answering or directive strategies. This is in line with the previously presented studies that defined peer tutors’ behaviour as rather knowledge-telling in nature (e.g. Chi et al. 2001; Graesser et al. 1995). Furthermore, the current findings are in line with statements that peer tutors’ questioning behaviour remains low-level and shallow (Graesser et al. 1995; Roscoe and Chi 2007). More specifically, peer tutors in this study asked primarily basic process-supportive questions, while deep-level questions and hinting questions occurred less frequently. However, in contrast to the aforementioned studies, this study shed a more optimistic picture with regard to peer tutor’s directive contributions and explanations. The majority of these contributions in this study often went beyond merely verifying tutees’ answers. The relatively high occurrence of more elaborated answers and directions might be explained by the specificity of this setting. Since the undergraduate course of Analysis I required complex reasoning, tutors’ directive contributions could not go without additional information and elaboration. Future research should investigate whether this also applies to other types of courses or curricula.

Similar as to the study by De Smet et al. (2008), a three-cluster typology was found. While ‘informers’ are named similarly in both studies, and ‘questioners’ can be related to the group of knowledge constructors, ‘motivational organisers’ can to some degree be compared with the third cluster of De Smet et al. (2008), i.e. motivators, although our cluster combined both structural–organisational and social–motivational support. Furthermore, the three clusters found in the study of De Smet et al. did not differ from one another in terms of providing social support (‘online socialisation’). In contrast, social–motivational support emerged as a more distinctive measure in this study. To some degree, the different coding schemes could be held accountable for these differences. More specifically, the current study distinguished more explicitly between structural–organisational and social–motivational support, and defined a more elaborated category of social–motivational actions.

Although structural–organisational and social–motivational strategies were mainly present among ‘motivational organisers’, these strategies were to some degree also present in the repertoire of respectively ‘questioners’ and ‘informers’. This could be explained by the fact that the specific strategies adopted by’questioners’ and’informers’ forced them to pay more attention to, respectively, structuring and organising sessions, and providing social–motivational support. More specifically, the strategies of ‘questioners’ stimulated more discussion among tutees, which could have yielded a greater need for moderating discussions and keeping track of time. On the other hand, ‘informers’ were mainly engaged in explaining and answering tutees’ questions, which naturally could have been accompanied by checking tutees’ understanding of these explanations, i.e. one of the dominating social–motivational support categories.

Interestingly, although the descriptive results of this study showed a predominance of directive strategies in general, the cluster of ‘informers’ (i.e. the directive tutoring approach) did not dominate the sample of peer tutors. Only slightly more motivational organisers were observed. This is in contrast with the results of De Smet et al. (2008) who defined the majority of their peer tutors as ‘informers’. The difference in setting, i.e. face-to-face compared with the online setting of De Smet et al., might be held accountable. Face-toface tutoring in small groups might request more motivational and organisational actions. For example, group management might be more challenging and therefore more highly needed, as well as more opportunities for informal discussions were available, which might have stimulated more social–motivational comments.

Additionally, this study reported four main challenges that underpin tutors’ approaches. Previous studies yielded similar or related challenges (e.g. De Smet et al. 2010b; Solomon and Crowe 2001). Moreover, the results seemed to indicate that peer tutors’ behaviour is not only person dependent but is also influenced by and generated within the interaction between the peer tutor and his environment. More specifically, numerous features on the level of the tutees (e.g. ability and lack of preparation) and the learning environment (e.g. group size and course content) were reported to stimulate or hamper peer tutors’ strategies. This yields the implication that interactional and contextual features should be taken into account when studying peer tutors’ behavioural strategies, as well as when aiming to change them by means of training. In general, these challenges did not come as a surprise since this study dealt with inexperienced peer tutors. Competent tutorship requires diverse complex competences, such as asking clear and challenging questions, and moderating discussions. In addition, results showed that the double role and status of peer tutors seemed to generate extra difficulties, for example in terms of group management or dealing with certain superficial expectations of tutees. This is in line with the concept of impression management, as defined by Colvin (2007), which states that peer tutors are challenged to define their specific role while also dealing with the perceptions and expectations of their tutees. Interestingly, it were mainly motivational organisers who reported struggling with this.

This brings this study to a remarkable conclusion, namely that different types of tutors seemed to experience the journey of tutoring in a slightly different manner. More specifically, counterparts of tutors’ concerns could be found in the specific strategies they adopted.

For instance, ‘questioners’ cognitive-demanding tutoring strategies seemed to be complementary to their higher demands for tutees (i.e. stressing tutees’ preparation as a fundamental prerequisite for successful tutoring). In contrast, ‘informers’ perceived tutees to be requesting basic verification, while at the same time they were the group that answered and steered to the highest degree. Finally, ‘motivational organisers’ struggled with structuring and organising sessions, while they also aimed to bring more didactic variety into the sessions. It might be that these specific struggles were transformed into points of attention which the tutors formulated for themselves to work on. However, it might also be that because of their focus on these particular actions, these specific challenges were more noticeable.

Some limitations need to be acknowledged. First, this study occurred within a specific educational setting and tutoring format. For instance, the 1:8 tutor-tutee ratio could have created a specific atmosphere in which structural–organisational actions needed more attention as compared with one-on-one tutoring. Hence, research in different settings and other tutoring formats is encouraged. Furthermore, as a consequence of the fine-grained level of analysis in this study, only a limited number of peer tutors were extensively interviewed. However, this exploratory study could be considered to be an onset for future research in which the exploration of behavioural actions is complemented with a tutoring approach-specific conceptualisation of concerns and personal beliefs related to the role of peer tutor. Finally, this study addressed peer tutors’ behaviour from a one-sided angle (i.e. peer tutor). However, results showed that informers experienced specific directive expectations from tutees, whereas motivators experienced a critical attitude among tutees towards tutors. It might be that these specific tutee behaviours could have caused tutors to adopt specific strategies to compensate for them. Future research should look into this further, as well as take into account who solicited the interaction or how the interaction was dealt with (Graesser et al. 1995).

Several implications for successful tutoring to occur can be distilled. Although peer tutors in this study were encouraged to adopt facilitative questioning strategies, they mainly engaged in answering and explaining, and generated rather general-level questions. Hence, deep-level questioning strategies (i.e. Socratic questioning) should be trained more accurately in novice peer tutors. Furthermore, helping peer tutors to deal with tutee diversity also emerges as a priority on the training agenda, as well as supporting them in dealing with their double role. In this respect, peer coaching or monitoring among peer tutors can be encouraged, as Topping and Ehly (2001) also proposed. By being confronted with other ‘types’ of peer tutors who do manage to adopt certain other strategies or approaches, peer tutors could overcome their own specific difficulties and learn to become more ‘complete’ or ‘all-round’ tutors who are able to flexibly combine different strategies if needed. Recently, more research has started investigating which ways are most beneficial in training peer tutors to become more ‘effective’ tutors (e.g. De Smet et al. 2010a; Ensergueix and Lafont 2010). More evidence in this respect is, however, needed. Finally, this study suggests that also tutees should be informed about the goals of tutoring and about their own related responsibilities since their behaviour or attitudes came frequently to the fore as hampering certain tutoring strategies.

To conclude, this study showed that peer tutors both approach and experience tutoring differently. Taking this diversity into account while, however, also accepting individual tutor preferences for certain approaches is one step in stimulating higher quality support by inexperienced peer tutors. Process-based research, such as this study, can oxygenate this process.
