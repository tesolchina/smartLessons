# The Role of Situational Authenticity in English Language Textbooks

Jim Yee Him Chan Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong

# Abstract

This study assesses the extent to which situational authenticity has been implemented in three commercial ELT textbook series in Hong Kong, which are designed to reflect the local sociolinguistic setting. The analysis involved the quantification and categorization of both written and spoken texts in the textbooks. The results of this analysis were subsequently compared with empirical evidence about Hong Kong people’s real-life language use. The findings suggest that a close alignment between the language-using contexts in textbooks and the real world is unrealistic, inappropriate and virtually impossible at school. The paper discusses the actual challenges faced by textbook writers, particularly in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts, namely the difficulties in dealing with (1) the contrast between real-world and classroom language needs, (2) local educational constraints, (3) the restricted societal role of English in EFL societies and (4) the lack of a needs analysis of the local language-using contexts for textbook design. It recommends that textbook writers adopt a more straightforward approach to designing tasks and highlights the important role of teachers in promoting interactional authenticity in the classroom.

# Introduction

Over the past few decades, the development of communicative language teaching (CLT) and task-based language teaching (TBLT) have inspired education ministries to reform their approach in the English language teaching (ELT) curriculum, particularly in the Asia-Pacific Region (Butler, 2011). Since the ultimate goal of both approaches is to foster learners’ communicative competence, central to the theme of TBLT has been the notion that a task should engage students in real-world language use. For instance, one of Skehan’s (1998: 95) criteria for defining a task is that ‘there is some sort of relationship to comparable real-world activities’. Similarly, Shehadeh (2005) defines a language learning task as one that ‘has a non-linguistic purpose or goal’ (Shehadeh, 2005: 18) and conveys meaning in a way that ‘reflects real-world language use’ (2005:19). Furthermore, Willis and Willis (2007: 136) establish three levels of classroom tasks that ‘mirror the real world’: (1) the level of meaning (i.e. learners producing meanings which will be useful in the real world); (2) the level of discourse (i.e. learners realizing discourse acts which reflect the real world); and (3) the level of activity (i.e. learners engaging in activities which reflect directly the use of language outside the classroom).

To accomplish this goal in TBLT, a key component is the adoption of authentic texts and tasks in teaching materials. In this regard, two types of authenticity have been identified by Ellis (2003), namely situational and interactional authenticity. The former concerns whether a task needs to correspond to ‘a situation found in the real world’ whereas the latter results in ‘patterns of interaction similar to those found in the real world’ (Ellis, 2003: 339). In a similar vein, Guariento and Morley (2001) describe four broad schools of thought regarding authenticity, viz. authenticity through a ‘genuine purpose’, ‘real world targets’, ‘classroom interaction’ and ‘engagement’ respectively. At the heart of their discussion is the idea that the ELT classroom should reflect in some measure language use in the real world.

In most Asian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts such as China, South Korea and Japan, policy makers have advocated the use of TBLT (or CLT) in government curriculum documents and yet, as Butler (2011: 40) observes, the concept of authenticity is merely ‘ambiguously understood’. In some cases, being ‘authentic’ means materials and activities that ‘accurately reflect the actual use of language and activities in English-speaking countries’ rather than the local context (2011: 42). Even if TBLT is intended to reflect the local sociolinguistic setting, how authenticity can be achieved in teaching materials remains a challenge because of various practical constraints (see Ellis, 2009; Butler, 2011). One of these constraints is what Richards (2006: 16) sees as ‘the myth of authenticity’ in which authenticity in ELT materials might not always be ‘necessary’ or ‘realistic’ in the classroom. Richards argues that although ‘authentic source texts are relatively easy to locate and likely to have more interesting content than specially written author-generated texts’ (2006: 16), learners generally find authentic texts ‘too complex for use in materials without substantial adaptation’ because ‘real world readers are assumed to have a reasonably high level of reading ability and a fairly substantial recognition vocabulary’ (2006: 17).

Another fundamental challenge, which tends to be overlooked in the literature, is the lack of a basis to achieve situational authenticity in textbooks owing to the limited use of English in many EFL societies. In other words, textbook writers might find it difficult to identify local English-using situations in which a task can be authentically contextualized. The design of a general ELT course for secondary (or primary) students therefore significantly differs from that in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) courses (e.g. business English), in which there might be a closer alignment between teaching and realworld language-using situations (Willis and Willis, 2007). From this perspective, whereas Belcher (2006) argues that texts in classroom materials can range from clearly authentic materials found in the target community, to semi-authentic materials produced by practitioners of specific contexts, to obviously inauthentic textbooks created by textbook writers, it could be understood that those in commercial textbook series tend to belong to the latter two. At the school level, any texts might need to be modified, restructured, recreated and/or contextualized so as to serve certain pedagogical needs or simply to cater for students’ language proficiency. All of these adaptations relate to one of Feng and Byram’s (2002) intriguing questions about authenticity in ELT textbooks, namely, ‘how do textbook writers define authentic materials?’

In order to understand the degree and nature of authenticity adopted in TBLT materials, it is essential to explore its implementation in specific sociolinguistic contexts, which is mostly guided by the local government documents. In many nation-states in Asia, commercial teaching materials exert great influence on teachers’ teaching approaches, especially those who lack knowledge in TBLT or have insufficient time to search for other sources due to a heavy workload (e.g. Carless, 2007). For example, while Hong Kong’s secondary ELT curriculum emphsizes learners’ acquisition of communicative competence in ‘purposeful’ and ‘authentic’ situations (see Curriculum Development Council, 2002: 24, 2007: 53), how these terms are realized in the classroom highly depends not only on teachers’ judgment but, more essentially, on the design of tasks in locally published textbooks. The relationship among TBLT, teaching materials and the language-using situation is highlighted in Hong Kong’s ELT curriculum:

The task-based approach is recommended in the English language Education curriculum to help learners progress towards the learning targets and objectives as well as develop the generic skills, values and attitudes. Through the use of tasks, learners are provided with purposeful contexts where they can learn and use English (i.e. the language skills, vocabulary, and grammar items and structures they have learnt) for meaningful communication… Organizing learning and teaching materials in modules, units and tasks thus provide learners with a framework that enables them to learn in purposeful and authentic situations (Curriculum Development Council, 2002: 24).

To date, few empirical studies have offered a systematic analysis of how authenticity is realized in task design in ELT textbooks. Some studies have adopted a rather indirect approach such as Carless (2003) and Lee and Bathmaker (2005) who elicited teachers’ perceptions about the use of English textbooks in the classroom via interview and survey data respectively. Along similar lines, Feng and Byram (2002) sought to evaluate the textbook writers’ thoughts about authenticity in college English textbooks by means of secondary sources. Several other studies have examined English teaching materials but they have different investigative foci, such as the overall design (Illés, 2009) and authenticity of dialogues in commercial textbooks (Gilmore, 2004) as well as a corpus-based content analysis of textbook blurbs on how language teaching theories are put into practice (Basturkman, 1999). Clearly, there is a lack of discussion on the correspondence between the design of authenticity in textbook tasks and real-world language use. To this end, the present study sets out to evaluate the degree of situational authenticity in the texts adopted in three locally published secondary textbook series and to compare them to the real sociolinguistic contexts in Hong Kong based on previous research.

# The Study

# Objectives

The main purpose of the present study is to explore how the concept of authenticity is implemented in three localized textbook series via their choice of texts contextualized for local settings. The primary focus is on situational authenticity as the implementation of interactional authenticity largely depends on teachers’ procedures in the classroom. Central to the evaluation is whether the designated authentic language-using contexts in the textbooks accord with real-world language use in Hong Kong. While ESP courses target English use in specific situations, the ELT courses at secondary level are intended to help students perform differing communicative functions after their graduation (e.g. further education, workplace, travelling).

# The Textbooks

Three general ELT coursebook series that are tailor-made for Hong Kong’s English language junior secondary curriculum (grade 7-9) (see Curriculum Development Council, 2002) were selected for textbook analysis:

1. Longman Elect JS1A-3B (2012) (6 books in total) [LE]   
2. Aristo Success 1A-3B (2012) (6 books in total) [AS]   
3. Oxford English 1A-3B(2010) (6 books in total) [OE]

These textbook series, as well as other editions by the same publishing houses, have traditionally been on the Education Bureau’s (EDB) recommended textbook list and, partly for this reason, they are widely used in secondary schools in Hong Kong. Unlike the senior secondary English language curriculum that prepares students for the highstakes school-exit public examination, the junior secondary curriculum allows greater flexibility for the design of authentic tasks in general ELT coursebooks.

# Data Analysis

The textbook analysis was conducted in two main investigative phases, the first being qualitative content analysis and the second quantitative data. First, the analysis sought to identify and describe the overall design and principle of authentic tasks in the junior secondary textbooks in terms of their nature, structure and arrangement in a chapter unit as well as the ways these tasks are locally contextualized from the perspective of local readers. Examples of how the tasks are situated are given in the findings and discussion section. In the second phase, the data analysis procedure comprised the quantification and categorization of tasks and texts in each of the textbook series. The counting of tasks (number in LE: 966; AS: 734; OE: 587) and texts (LE: 828; AS: 649; OE: 570) was based on their frequency of occurrences in all the textbook units. These tasks were then categorized with regard to their focus on different language skills (writing, reading, listening and speaking) whereas the texts were classified based on their genre (e.g. poster, leaflet, blog). The discussion of these tasks and texts was nevertheless accompanied by qualitative data about their designated language-using situations.

Written and spoken texts were analysed separately. The spoken texts were mainly identified from the listening tasks (and accompanying tapescripts) in the textbooks as they provide students with audio inputs embedded in an English-speaking situation. The categorization of written and spoken texts yielded 95 and 12 text-types respectively. These categorized data were then compared to two large-scale recent surveys, which elicited the English-using habits of teenagers and adults in Hong Kong (Evans, 2010a, 2011). In other words, this part of the analysis examined if there is any association between the most frequently appearing text-types in the textbooks and the most important language-using situations identified in the two studies.

# Findings and Discussion

# Overall Structure of Textbooks

In their introduction, all three textbooks claim to provide a task-based learning course for junior secondary students while two of them (LE and AS) also describe themselves as theme-based. These series follow the recommended hierarchy of the module-unit-task structure and these modules and units accord with the suggested localized themes provided by EDB (see Curriculum Development Council, 2002: A6-A8). In addition, the writers seem conscious that tasks are usually concerned with real-world language use and they are frequently associated with notions such as ‘contextualized’, ‘authentic’, ‘realistic’ and ‘meaningful’. An example from two of the textbook series is given below respectively:

In this section, students complete authentic reading, speaking and listening tasks in context, culminating in a writing task (OE, book 1A, p.iii, Integrated tasks).

Each unit contains contextualized tasks which cross the other three main strands: speaking, listening and writing. The tasks are set in realistic contexts and are target-specific to enable students to apply the language functions, vocabulary and knowledge learned in the unit (AS, book 1A, Task).

Many of the themes in the textbooks are associated with local topics such as culture (e.g. festivals, traditional occupations, food), places (e.g. tourist spots), vehicles (e.g. transportation) and social issues (e.g. drugs, obesity, pollution) in Hong Kong whereas a number of them are rather international ones (e.g. celebrities, festivals, travelling). Regardless of the choice of topics, the readers are usually situated in the school context, where they retain their role as a student, friend or relative to complete a short activity or a series of activities (in the integrated task). These activities are either school-related (e.g. group project, presentation) or simulate what youngsters do in their daily life (e.g. writing a blog entry, helping a friend). In some other cases, the readers are assigned a role as participating in a club, organization or a part-time job. Two examples (i.e. a short and an integrated task respectively) of how textbook authors provide an identity to the readers are given below:

![](img/d1f8f6901b91fe3ba8571a6d3d7b46802480fa2b0758f5c933d24a27fd0fbac4.jpg)  
Figure 1. Proportions of Speaking, Listening and Writing/Reading Tasks in Three Textbook Series.

Your cousin, Sue, wants to send a letter to ‘Pet world’ about her dog Trixi. She is writing the events in the order they happened. Help her complete her description (OE, book 1A, p.59).

You are Chris, a voluntary worker at Hong Kong Youth Association. Mr Lam, the manager of the association, has asked you to help plan a summer tour programme. Listen to what he says at a meeting and make changes to the note sheet you have prepared (LE, book 1B, p.18).

As general ELT coursebooks, the units unsurprisingly include the four main language skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) as well as certain grammatical items and linguistic knowledge. Furthermore, linguistic inputs are embedded in numerous short isolated tasks followed by an integrated task that engages learners in the four language skills. In practical terms, the short tasks tend to correspond to the ‘weak’ version of TBLT, which, according to Littlewood (2004), is positioned towards the ‘focus-onforms’ end on his proposed continuum with ‘focus-on-meaning’ at the other end. In other words, they are mainly ‘input-providing’ tasks in which target language items or knowledge is/are given to students so as to help them complete a traditional fill-in-the-blank (or others such as multiple-choice, proof-reading and matching) exercise but with a situation provided. Thereby in the integrated task, the students are allowed to use the target language elements in the unit together with their own linguistic resources to fulfill the purpose(s) in a scenario through a collection of activities. While this type of integrated task is seemingly a relatively ‘stronger’ version of TBLT (i.e. towards the ‘focus-onmeaning’ end on Littlewood’s continuum), we shall see in the later section that the situation described can be rather artificial or semi-authentic.

In Figure 1 the proportions of speaking, listening and writing/reading task to the total number of tasks in the three textbook series are illustrated respectively. The findings suggest that the majority of tasks are writing/reading-related (AS: $7 0 . 0 \%$ , LE: $7 2 . 7 \%$ , OE: $8 4 . 0 \%$ ) whereas a rather small proportion are listening tasks (AS: $3 . 4 \%$ , LE: $5 . 5 \%$ , OE: $4 . 1 \%$ ), particularly for the OE series. Comparatively, the AS $( 2 6 . 6 \% )$ and LE $( 2 1 . 8 \% )$ textbook series have also provided more opportunities for students to practise their speaking in both short (e.g. sharing activities, exchanging ideas with classmates, giving feedback) and longer tasks (e.g. interviewing classmates, discussing an issue, presenting ideas) (cf. OE: $1 1 . 9 \%$ ).

Though one may argue that speaking and listening in the classroom can also be realized in teachers’ speech and teacher/student-student interactions, it is uncertain whether this arrangement of including few speaking-related activities in the textbooks is due to the publishers’ limited resources to create more audio materials, the lack of time in the teaching schedule in the local context to practise speaking/listening exercises, or simply a genuine reflection of the English-using situation in Hong Kong where spoken English has a restricted societal role. From a sociolinguistic perspective, Li (2009) has argued that the main problem of learning English in Hong Kong is that students have little need to use English outside the classroom. However, this claim might not be entirely accurate since research shows that a considerable amount of English-mediated written communication takes place in Hong Kong, particularly in the domains of government, law, education, business and professional employment (see Evans, 2010b) as well as in the daily lives of the young people (e.g. Evans, 2011). Some use of spoken English is also reported in people’s leisure time (e.g. Evans, 2011) and, more significantly, in professional communication (e.g. Evans, 2010a). The greater emphasis on writing/reading tasks in the textbooks perhaps reflects the writers’ perception of this role of written vis-à-vis spoken English discourses in the local context. It could also stem from the traditional emphasis on writing and reading in public examinations in Hong Kong. Nonetheless, in cases where ELT teachers think that students lack listening and speaking practice, they might often use additional listening and speaking materials to complement the insufficient resources provided in these general ELT textbooks.

# Authenticity of Written English Texts

A key dimension in the present study is the degree of situational authenticity reflected in the texts selected or designed by the textbook writers. Figure 2 illustrates the most frequently appearing written texts in the three sets of textbooks. Among all the texts, two main types of authentic texts were identified, one being the contextualization of texts in the classroom discourse (texts with \*) whereas the others simulate situations in the real world. Furthermore, two exceptional cases (in brackets) were in fact spoken texts of monologue and dialogue and they were usually adopted in the textbooks as model speaking scripts for students, fill-in-the-blank exercises, or sometimes contextualized information-giving speeches.

Interestingly, the most frequent text types (five out of the top six) belonged to the first category though, in general, the second type contributes to the overwhelming majority of all text categories $( 8 5 . 3 \% )$ . That is to say, there seems to be a need by the textbook writers to create space for students’ language production in the classroombased activities. For instance, captioned pictures/photos (total number: 106) are used most commonly and regularly in the textbooks to engage students in warm-up or discussion tasks to both arouse their interest and set the scene for each chapter. School worksheets (95), mind maps (77) and tables (45) are also often included to contextualize an in-class task particularly in listening and speaking. As for (mainly) comprehension tasks, the textbook authors designed pre-reading and follow-up questions either/ both with or without a specified context. By contextualized questions (77) we simply mean they are accompanied by a scenario claiming that these questions were given by the teacher, asked by your relatives/friends or designed by a school club. In other cases, questions were put forward directly with the instructional statement ‘complete the questions’ (52).

![](img/bda769d6e6137d549bf55195e1f4045c0431e7a280ccd8b2996e77d4833ba899.jpg)  
Figure 2. Top 20 Written Text Types in Three Textbook Series.

Apparently, these strategies vary among the different textbook series and they revealed how textbook writers situate a task in the real classroom context. For example, while most tasks in all the textbooks tend to be given a context or scenario, these warm-up activities (and/or pre-reading sections), especially in the AS and LE series, are usually not contextualized but are only given as instructional statements:

What advice would you give these teenagers [in the pictures]? Working in groups, discuss a problem you think affects teenagers the most and suggest possible solutions. Then present your ideas in class. You may begin your presentation like: [sample expressions given] (AS, book 2B, p.3, warm-up)

Which of the following things do you worry about? Rank the issues from ‘1’ to $\cdot _ { 7 } ,$ $1 =$ what you worry about most, $7 =$ what you worry about least. Now work in pairs. Tell your partner how you ranked the things and explain why you ranked them the way you did. You can begin like this [sample expressions given] (LE, book 2B, p.2, warm-up)

Alternatively, the OE authors invariably create roles and situations for all the warm-up and pre-reading activities:

You have learnt that some students in your school are drug addicts. You are shocked and are writing about it on your blog. Complete your entry (OE, book 2B, p.69, pre-reading).

As can be seen in the findings, the LE authors tend to provide worksheets for students which are claimed to be given by the instructors (e.g. ‘your native-speaker teacher’) and both the AS and LE writers favour using mind maps and tables. Interestingly, though these approaches apparently develop a scenario for language use in the classroom, the creation of ‘another teacher’ in the instructional statement could be rather ‘strange’, especially in the presence of the ‘real teacher’ who is also giving instructions to the students (see the two examples below).

Ms Lau wants you to complete a worksheet about the poem. To help you, she gives you the following information. Read the information [about some reading skills] and complete the worksheet below (LE, book 2A, p.31).

Work with a partner or as a group. You and your classmates need to plan a day trip for student travellers to Hong Kong. Your teacher gives you the information on p.93 and p.94 to help you start off. Go online to research further if needed, and brainstorm ideas using the mind map below (AS, book 1A, p.92).

There is a tendency, however, that tasks are contextualized in wider real-life situations rather than in restricted classroom settings in the OE series. In some cases, the OE writers prefer to make the task a note-jotting/completing activity. This is perhaps deemed to be useful in the real world. In terms of their ways of providing language inputs to students, again, LE authors usually ‘package’ the information as to be given by the instructor as described in the textbook (see the above first example). Alternatively, linguistic inputs are often introduced as an instructor’s speech in a written text in the AS textbook set (see the following example) but, in the OE textbooks, they are often provided as simply an information box carrying the target language inputs without any context provided.

Your teacher wants you to learn the use of ‘let’ and ‘make’. Read what she says… [a speech bubble about the two words] (AS, book 1B, p.76)

This sense of ‘oddness’ is not only found in the imaginative role of an instructor in the instructional statements, but it is also found in the design of the language-using purposes and situations, which are equally rather ‘artificial’ and ‘unreal’. Some of these tasks include correcting grammatical mistakes in a friend’s blog entry, completing an online quiz given to students by the teacher, filling in the blanks for your online chat because of a problem with your computer screen and identifying the blurred words on the newspaper advertisement which has got wet. As many of these so-called ‘tasks’ in fact resemble traditional exercises only with the addition of a situation, they might easily lose their primary function of providing a language-using goal in TBLT if student readers perceive them as solely a ‘to-do’ exercise without paying attention to (which they do not actually need to) the artificial background.

In order to further analyse the choice of written English texts in the textbooks, the realworld simulating text categories were compared to recent empirical evidence, which reveals Hong Kong people’s English-using habits in their leisure time (Evans, 2011) and the workplace (Evans, 2010a). Based on the two studies, the most important English texts in Hong Kong are prioritized in Table 1, where items above the dotted lines indicate a benchmark of important language use in the two studies. The italicized ones correspond to the top 20 categories in the textbook data whereas those with $( ^ { * } )$ indicate their absence. The rest of the texts also appear in the textbooks but were in relatively lower frequency.

The findings suggest that the text types chosen in the textbooks are to some extent reflective of Hong Kong people’s habits of writing/reading in English, especially with respect to teenagers’ and adults’ English-related activities in their leisure time. More specifically, websites (102), blogs (73), magazines (69), newspapers (62), emails (62) and letters (60) are the most dominant real-life text types in the textbooks. Although books, comics, diaries, reports, memos, newsletters and promotional materials are not included in the top 20 text types, they are occasionally found in the textbooks in text categories such as story/novel extract (30), comic/cartoon strip (28), diary/journal (21), report (20), memo (6), newsletter (20) and advertisement (14) respectively. However, even if some of the written texts accord with real-world language use, their frequency of occurrence might not be equally applicable to their order of importance in real life.

Indeed, it is quite surprising there are no instances of short texts associated with instant messaging and SMS probably because they are relatively new technologies in the globalized world. In fact, some of these textbooks have gone through several editions but have not been fully updated. Furthermore, other highly workplace/profession-specific discourses such as faxes, minutes, circulars and legal documents do not occur in the textbooks. In contrast, several text types that appear quite frequently in the textbooks (e.g. poster 41, poem 38, leaflet 36) are not recorded in the two empirical studies. The introduction of poems in these textbook series is perhaps due to the emphasis on language arts in Hong Kong’s ELT curriculum. Though this form of language arts might not be very common in contemporary Hong Kong society, it is the purpose of the Education Bureau (EDB) to raise students’ interest as well as to promote appreciation of the language. In addition, the frequent inclusion of articles and essays (56) in the textbooks might also be attributed to their important role in students’ future public examination as well as the flexibility of involving a wide range of content elements.

# Authenticity of Spoken English Texts

It is assumed that the choice of spoken English situations in the textbooks’ audio listening tasks reflects what the writers thought about the corresponding real-life language use in the local context. From this viewpoint, the findings depicted in Figure 3 reveal that the overwhelming majority of recordings in these textbooks simulate audio programs on the radio or in internet podcasts (37), particularly in the OE and LE series. In the AS series, the key sources were found to be audio recordings of informal discussions (e.g. among students and/or between students and teachers) and telephone conversations. Other relatively common texts in all the textbooks comprise recordings of face-to-face interviews, monologue speeches (e.g. by the teacher, manager of a company), seminars/lessons, formal meetings and poems but they in fact merely range from 11 to 5 in terms of the total numbers. As the LE textbooks contain more tasks, they include more texts and texttypes, among which their choice of recordings of plays and songs reflects the component of language arts in the curriculum. In contrast, the OE and AS series have incorporated a small number of audio recordings of people participating in a guided tour. One instance of a weather announcement is also found in the AS textbooks.

The limited variety of spoken English contexts in the textbooks perhaps stems from the restricted use of spoken English in Hong Kong, especially in people’s leisure time, where only a number of rather receptive uses of spoken English (i.e. film, music, television, overseas travelling) were reported to be above the benchmark (Evans, 2011) (see Table 2). This probably indicates that, like most EFL contexts, spoken English is mainly used for specific workplace and professionals purposes in situations such as formal meetings, conferences, seminars, presentations and telephoning. In addition, it might also not be expected that these situations should occur in junior secondary textbooks, which serve students’ broader communicative functions. In turn, challenges might have been created for textbook authors who need to design samples of authentic spoken English use in audio listening tasks from the perspective of students. Given that students would have few opportunities for spoken English interactions, listening tasks might only be confined to simulating audio recordings of interactions on the radio and the internet which, at the same time, could maximize flexibility in task design. Furthermore, Englishmediated interactions within the school context are quite rare, although they are commonly simulated as informal/formal discussions, telephone conversations and interviews in the tasks mainly as spoken teaching models.

(Sources: Evans, 2010a, 2011).

Taking account of the real-life spoken English contexts, we can observe a number of correspondences with the spoken texts in the textbooks (in italics), namely formal/informal discussions/meetings, telephoning, seminars, radio, travelling overseas (as compared to audio tours in the textbooks), music (i.e. songs) as well as talks/lectures and presentations (i.e. monologue speeches). Many of the genuine interactional situations (with \*) in Hong Kong people’s leisure time (e.g. social functions/gathering, shopping, dining in restaurants) and the workplace (e.g. conferences, staff training, casual chat with colleagues) are not simulated in the textbooks. Nonetheless, it is possible that the modeling and practising of authentic speaking interaction can be compensated through daily teaching activities in ELT lessons, as can be the use of films. Students’ practice of spoken English is mainly guided by the spoken tasks in these textbooks, which are often situated in a discussion for a school project or school-related function. Like our discovery in the choice of written texts in the textbooks, it seems that the design of listening tasks does not follow what is most crucial in the real world language use. While one possible reason could be the constraints of reflecting the limited genuine language situations particularly in the EFL classroom, it is doubtful whether the writers would have formerly undergone or taken reference of any comprehensive needs analysis of the local context before designing the tasks.

# Conclusion

The present study has evaluated how situational authenticity is implemented in three textbook series with reference to research into the actual use of written and spoken English in Hong Kong. The findings generally reveal that a complete correspondence between the textbook design and local sociolinguistic environment is both unrealistic and inappropriate at school. Based on our analysis, there are four key observations that make it virtually impossible. First, the contrast between real world language use and students’ classroom language needs has made the design of participants’ role and language situation difficult. This has resulted in two types of authentic texts, i.e. situated in the classroom context and creating a wider real-life situation, which vary among the selected textbook series.

Second, the input-providing approach to TBLT is widely adopted in the textbooks so as to address local educational constraints such as the influence of traditional teaching approaches, the washback effect of the high-stakes examinations, the limited lesson time and agenda in the curriculum (see Ellis, 2009; Butler, 2011). This approach allows greater flexibility to teachers, who might be shifting from traditional Presentation-Practice-Production teaching to the relatively new concept of TBLT. Third, though numerous written English texts in the three textbook series do accord with local language use, writers have evidently encountered considerable difficulties in selecting spoken texts in audio listening tasks because, like many EFL contexts, spoken English has a relatively limited societal role apart from in specific situations such as the workplace and higher education. Finally, the disjunction between texts in the textbooks and real-life language settings might indicate the lack of a detailed needs analysis when designing the textbooks. In other words, it is possible that these textbook writers designed the textbook tasks merely on the basis of the ELT curriculum suggested by EDB, their expert opinion, experience and understanding of the school context as well as imagination.

Whereas situational authenticity is more readily achieved in ESP courses (Willis and Willis, 2007), a high degree of it might not be appropriate for general ELT classrooms. Despite the textbook writers’ admirable intention to contextualize a task for purposeful language use in the classroom, as revealed in some of the textbooks, insisting on creating an ‘authentic’ scenario might result in quite ‘unreal’ or ‘weird’ tasks for students. This perhaps echoes Carless’s (2007: 604) recommendation that ‘a soft or weak version of task-based teaching seems to be a preferred option in the Hong Kong school context, with ‘task’ being interpreted modestly along the lines of communicative practice’. In this sense, teachers might thereafter take a more important role in interpreting and implementing tasks in the textbooks to foster students’ communicative ability. As Ellis (2009: 227) rightly suggests, the adoption of a more flexible form of TBLT could be more appropriate in the EFL classroom, the centrality of which lies in the promotion of ‘naturally occurring language use’ (i.e. interactional authenticity) in the classroom. From the perspective of textbook writers, instead of strongly advocating the inclusion of highly ‘contextualized’ or ‘authentic’ tasks for marketing purposes, the use of more straightforward instructional statements (rather than persistently creating an artificial scenario) might sometimes be more practical on the condition that the task truly facilitates communicative language use in the classroom. Nevertheless, even though Illés (2009) has illustrated that successful ELT coursebooks do not necessarily require highly authentic textual data if they promote quality interactional authenticity, it seems that a needs analysis of the local sociolinguistic situation might provide additional input for the implementation of situational authenticity in the ELT textbooks.
