# ABSTRACT

The role of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in developing vocabulary knowledge has been investigated extensively in the field of English for Academic Purposes with positive outcomes. However, its implications for medical education, and specifically foreign languages for medical purposes, have not received much attention. This study fills the gap by investigating a cohort $( n = 2 2 )$ of Indian medical students’ descriptions and explanations of their preferred vocabulary learning strategies at a medical university in South China, with specific reference to their engagement with CALL technologies. The results indicate that CALL technologies are reported to support cognitive and metacognitive learning activities but not vocabulary learning in terms of compensation and affective aspects. CALL technologies are also reported to be used significantly more often to learn meaning, rather than form and use of medical vocabulary knowledge. CALL technologies can facilitate the develop ment of more receptive instead of the productive vocabulary knowledge. This study yields pedagogical implications for using CALL applications to develop foreign language medical students’ vocabulary learning strategies in the social, affective and compensational dimensions.

# Introduction

The terminology learning in medical education helps students in healthcare and nursing fields to better describe anatomical conditions or prepare for their further professions, and Seidlein et  al. (2020) stressed the importance of medical vocabulary in ensuring unambiguous and reliable communication in daily clinical practice. At least three lessons can be learned from recent studies in teaching medical terminology to second language learners. Corpus linguistic research on terminology learning has yielded specialized medical morpheme lists as learning resources for students to access (e.g. Le & Miller, 2020). In the field of English for Academic Purposes (EAP), although the role of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in vocabulary learning has been investigated extensively (Enayati & Gilakjani; 2020; Ömer, 2011; Salsbury, 2006), its implications for medical education have not received sufficient attention. A small number of researchers have found significant potential for medical students in using videogames, creating their own electronic medical dictionaries, and using the Internet as a learning resource (Müller, 2012; Van de Poel et  al., 2013; Vorona, 2019). Unlike research in the EAP context, studies in medical education have neither systematically measured students’ use of vocabulary learning strategies (VLS), nor the depth of their vocabulary knowledge, let alone their relationships with CALL technologies. Therefore, this study fills the gap by investigating a group of Indian medical students’ descriptions and explanations of their VLS use at a university in South China, with special reference to their engagement with a wide range of CALL technologies.

# Functions of CALL technologies

Only a handful of studies have explored the use of CALL technologies to assist medical students in learning medical terminology in a foreign language (Dang, 2020; Müller, 2012; Van de Poel et  al., 2013; Vorona, 2019). The functions of CALL identified in these studies include the following four aspects: (1) using Internet resources to facilitate learning of Latin and medical terminology (Vorona, 2019); (2) using medical TV programs to facilitate incidental learning of specialized vocabulary (Dang, 2020); (3) using online dictionaries as editable interactive booklets (Van de Poel et  al., 2013), and (4) playing videogames to increase nurse trainees’ exposure to medical words (Müller, 2012). For example, an online medical dictionary was developed in South Africa to help students overcome language barriers and acquire multilingual terms with improved motivation. Students were expected to upload comments online, together with additional translations and images, to develop the dictionary in a collaborative manner (Van de Poel et  al., 2013). Müller (2012) asserted the efficacy of a videogame called Medicina with a pre-/post-test design and a qualitative survey. Players were encouraged to identify specific medications with correct pronunciation among five similarly named terms in the presence of background noise. They had a limited amount of time to make their decision, and after that, feedback was provided in a variety of ways to help them focus and improve their knowledge of medical vocabulary when writing or speaking.

To summarize, these previous studies mainly collected evidence for learners’ cognitive and metacognitive learning processes in order to evaluate the effectiveness of CALL technologies in developing discipline-related vocabulary. However, there is no study examining its implications for different VLS categories (Oxford, 1990), nor the types and levels of vocabulary knowledge (Nation, 2001) that medical learners obtain in their learning processes.

# Vocabulary learning strategies in second language medical students

In terms of VLS in medical education, a search on Web of Science identified 11 empirical studies between 2005 and 2020. Table 1 summarizes the findings of these studies by labeling relevant strategies with the VLS classification from Oxford (1990), including two general strategies (direct and indirect strategies) and six specific strategies: memory, cognitive and compensation for the direct type, and metacognitive, social and affective for the indirect category. Overall, mixed patterns emerged from these studies and there were three noticeable features regarding VLS in medical education.

First of all, not all VLS are supported by the current technologies in the context of learning medical terminology. Cognitive strategies are mentioned the most frequently in four papers (Dang, 2020; Müller, 2012; Van de Poel et  al., 2013; Vorona, 2019), followed by memory (Müller, 2012; Van de Poel et  al., 2013), metacognitive (Müller, 2012; Vorona, 2019), social (Van de Poel et  al., 2013; Vorona, 2019) and affective (Van de Poel et  al., 2013; Vorona, 2019) strategies in two papers respectively. Compensation strategies are not mentioned in any of these studies. Four computer-mediated technologies are discussed in these papers, including Internet resources to study medical Latin words, disciplinary TV programs to increase exposure to medical terminology, an online medical dictionary with topic-based words and peer comments, and a vocabulary videogame with sounds and images to enable users to distinguish between confusing medical terms.

The second feature of VLS in medical education is the use of medical corpora in medical students’ vocabulary acquisition. Derived from web-based resources of medical texts, lectures or seminars, vocabulary lists (including roots, prefixes and suffixes) have been developed based on the criteria of occurrence frequency, range and importance. The lists were then provided for students to assist terminology learning and enable a better understanding of word formation (Dang, 2020; Le & Miller, 2020; Solati, 2014).

<html><body><table><tr><td>Ghobain (2020) in Saudi Arabia</td><td>Learners&#x27; independency is improved after implicit medical terminology learning</td><td> Incidental learninge</td><td>Form + Meaning Receptive</td></tr><tr><td>Le and Miller (2020) corpus studye</td><td>A final list of 136 specialized medical morphemes is produced. as a reliable and useful resource for medical students</td><td> Memory strategy</td><td>Form + Meaning Receptive</td></tr><tr><td>Dang (2020) corpus study</td><td>A Medical Spoke Word List (895 words) is developed and medicine-related television programs have potentials for learning medical terminology in lectures and seminars</td><td>Cognitive strategye Incidental learning CALL</td><td>Form + Meaning Receptive</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Toomer and Elgort (2019) in New Zealand Repeated exposure to bolded medical collocations produces more explicit vocabulary knowledge while only reading collocations leads to acquisition of implicit knowledge</td><td>Cognitive strategy Incidental learning</td><td>Form + Meaning + Use Pro</td></tr><tr><td>Vorona (2019) in Ukraine</td><td>Learners can study professional Latin medical terminology by. using Internet resources</td><td>Cognitive+ Metacognitive+ Affective + Social strategy</td><td>Form + Meaning + Use Rec</td></tr><tr><td>Wang et al.

Lastly, apart from these intentional medical vocabulary learning methods, incidental learning is found to be linked to the use of CALL technologies in acquiring complex L2 medical terminology. Although incidental learning in the EAP context has been presented as a computer-mediated benefit (Hu et  al., 2014; Khezrlou et  al., 2017), only two medical papers identified were related to both incidental learning and the CALL environment: (1) the use of videogames as a tool to present medical vocabulary to students has been suggested as an effective and informal method in medical education (Müller, 2012), and (2) TV programs are potential sources to help students learn medical terminology implicitly when they watch them regularly (Dang, 2020).

# The levels and types of vocabulary knowledge

Apart from the integration of CALL technologies with VLS, what is missing from the previous discussion on medical vocabulary learning is the development of levels and types of vocabulary knowledge. It seems that the lack of guidance from the established framework in describing and measuring vocabulary knowledge prevents researchers from comparing the effectiveness of using different CALL technologies in professional vocabulary learning. Taking Nation (2001)’s taxonomy (see Appendix) of vocabulary knowledge as the reference, Table 1 suggests that within the 11 identified papers, the levels of form and meaning seem to be mentioned more often than the level of use.

Most papers in this table have discussed developing more efficient learning methods, including mnemonics, morpheme lists or taking professional veterinary courses to assist medical learners’ memorization, yet very limited research has mentioned authentic medical record writing or communications with patients as terminology learning tasks to improve learners’ vocabulary knowledge. The four CALL studies reviewed previously with reference to VLS also over-emphasized form and meaning levels (Dang, 2020; Müller, 2012; Van de Poel et  al., 2013; Vorona, 2019) rather than use (Vorona, 2019), suggesting that CALL technologies might facilitate medical students’ learning rather than their actual use of professional vocabulary knowledge. For example, Müller (2012) designed a medical vocabulary videogame to improve users’ reaction time for confused medication names when identifying the correct written and spoken word forms. However, this study did not provide users with the opportunity to speak out or write down these terms in actual sentences to learn vocabulary knowledge at the use level, such as vocabulary grammatical functions, collocations and constraints on use.

A similar pattern is about the impact of CALL technologies on receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge. Previous studies in medical education have investigated receptive knowledge whereas productive knowledge has rarely been examined in either the traditional face-to-face learning environment without the assistance of CALL technological support (hereinafter traditional condition) or CALL conditions (Toomer & Elgort, 2019). The use of CALL technologies to develop medical students’ receptive vocabulary knowledge has been explored in all four studies reviewed by applying four different tech-mediated approaches (Dang, 2020; Müller, 2012; Van de Poel et  al., 2013; Vorona, 2019). However, there is still a need for an investigation of levels (form, meaning and use) and types (receptive and productive) of medical students’ vocabulary knowledge.

Even though VLS classifications (Oxford, 1990) are quite established together with some specific technological aids, the link between CALL technologies and VLS has not been investigated extensively in medical education (Peterson, 2021; Yang et  al., 2021) as the VLS taxonomy (Oxford, 1990) has not been used as a framework to guide data collection or analysis. It is also clear that previous studies in medical education have not been informed by Nation (2001)’s vocabulary knowledge taxonomy. Therefore, the learning outcomes and development of medical vocabulary knowledge at form, meaning and use levels from the previously reviewed papers are concluded based on speculation rather than measurement or students’ self-evaluation. To our knowledge, there has not been any empirical study to investigate both the levels and types of medical vocabulary knowledge obtained with CALL technologies.

Therefore, this study aims to explore medical students’ VLS and vocabulary knowledge with the assistance of CALL, and the following research questions are raised:

Research Question 1: What types of vocabulary learning strategies are used by second language medical students with the assistance of CALL technologies?   
Research Question 2: What levels (form, meaning and use) and types (productive and receptive) of vocabulary knowledge are learned using CALL technologies?

# Methods

# Context and participants

An increasing number of Indian students, more than 21,000 in 2019, came to China to study medicine. While pursuing their medical degrees, they also had to study Chinese to overcome language barriers (Yu et  al.,

2021). In 2019, 89 clinical medical students from India were contacted, and 35 of them agreed to take part in the study. However, these students went back to India at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and finally only 22 volunteers remained in contact online in 2020. They were in their junior or senior year of university, with a mean age of 21 years and more than three years of Chinese language learning experience. Following the university’s curriculum, these students took Chinese language courses in the first two years, and then pursued professional study in the third and fourth years in the field of clinical medicine. As part of the Chinese language requirement before graduation, they were required to pass medical examinations in Chinese, to both achieve intermediate-high language proficiency and gain sound medical knowledge. Most of them were planning to return to India to be local doctors. All participants agreed to communicate in English for this interview via a social media platform WeChat, although sometimes Chinese was used to describe or refer to specific medical terms.

# Data collection

Semi-structured interviews were used as the primary data collection method. The online interviews were conducted from May to July 2020 and it was difficult to estimate the length of time for each interview as some lasted for a few days. The interview prompts included What are your three most preferred medical vocabulary learning strategies? What have you done to learn medical vocabulary in Chinese? In order to avoid biased responses from the interviewees, the questions were not directly related to the usage of mobile phones or other types of electronic devices for learning medical vocabulary. Further explanations and other forms of evidence such as illustrations, names, screenshots of applications or self-evaluated learning outcomes were encouraged to be shared. The interviews were conducted by typing text messages on the social networking site. Additional data were collected via this platform, including photocopies of homework, slides and notes from lectures. Ethics approval was obtained from the research committee at University International College, Macau University of Science and Technology. To protect interviewees’ anonymity and confidentiality, pseudonyms were assigned to each participant in the interview transcripts.

# Instruments

The data from interviews were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The numerical results were recorded in Tables 2 and 3. To present the participants’ use of VLS in a comparative sense in both conditions, the first column in the two tables was assigned to decide whether students acquire medical vocabulary with the assistance of CALL technologies, with the number $^ { \mathfrak { c } } _ { 1 } \cdot$ referring to the CALL and the number $^ { \mathfrak { c } } 0 ^ { \mathfrak { r } }$ for the non-CALL condition for the benefit of carrying out independent $t$ -tests in the two groups. In order to analyze students’ transcripts statistically, the coding was presented in a numerical form. In Table 2, a number of columns were assigned to include categories of VLS and incidental learning. Regarding a quote mentioning a specific strategy, $\cdot _ { 1 } \cdot$ was recorded in the corresponding space while other spaces were filled with the figure $^ { \mathfrak { c } } 0 \mathrm { : }$ The same coding method was also applied in Table 3 to code students’ levels and types of medical vocabulary knowledge.

# Data coding

Two researchers coded the data inductively and independently to label and quantify the participants’ responses. Though each participant was asked to share three VLS, some single descriptions included more than one type and were coded as a separate VLS to collect participants’ comprehensive vocabulary learning processes. To answer the first research question, the interview transcripts were coded based on the VLS framework (Oxford, 1990). Based on this taxonomy, memory strategies in the CALL condition refer to the information arrangement and association with the help of images, sounds or other mental linkages provided by technologies while cognitive strategies encourage the target language’s manipulation and transformation to use applications to receive or send messages, and compensation types rely on the CALL condition to help learners guess intelligently or overcome target languages’ limitations. Within the indirect VLS category, metacognitive strategies are applied when learners turn to technologies to manage, plan or evaluate their medical vocabulary learning, and social strategies are associated with the online interaction function enabled by CALL to communicate with others. Learners can also use different tech-mediated applications to control or manage their emotions and attitudes when applying affective strategies.

Apart from categorizing VLS in the CALL environment, the vocabulary knowledge taxonomy (Nation, 2001) was used to code the interview data in order to answer the second research question. Disagreements between the two researchers were resolved through discussions and consultations with senior colleagues. SPSS and Excel were used to obtain descriptive data of participants’ VLS and vocabulary knowledge, which indicated their strategy preference and terminology acquisition levels. Moreover, independent $t { \cdot }$ -tests and Cohen’s $d$ were carried out to detect the significance and effect size of the difference in VLS and vocabulary knowledge between CALL and the non-CALL conditions. Following the statistical analysis, a thematic analysis of interviewees’ descriptions was then conducted to gain more insights into the identified VLS and vocabulary knowledge patterns.

# Results

# Quantitative results

In response to the first research question regarding the integration of VLS with CALL technologies, almost one-third of the identified medical vocabulary learning strategies were reported to be applied with the assistance of CALL technologies $\left( N = 2 1 \right)$ ). From descriptive data (Table 4), the most frequently mentioned VLS in the CALL condition was cognitive $M = 0 . 6 7$ , $S D ~ = ~ 0 . 4 8 )$ strategies, followed by metacognitive ( $M = 0 . 1 9$ , $S D = 0 . 4 0 \mathrm { \AA }$ ) strategies, but compensation ( $M = 0$ , $S D = 0$ ) and affective $M = 0$ , $S D = 0$ ) learning strategies were not reported to be associated with CALL technologies. This frequency pattern was identified to be similar to that of the traditional condition, though $t { \cdot }$ -tests (Table 5) suggested that some specific VLS usage (memory, metacognitive and social) in the traditional condition outnumbered that in CALL condition ( $\dot { \cal d } = 0 . 5 0 8$ , 0.558 and 0.576). Incidental learning $M = 0 . 1$ , $S D = 0 . 3 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ was reported to be more closely aligned with CALL compared to the association in the traditional condition. These findings can be interpreted as medical students’ VLS preference and actual usage of CALL technologies, which can be further confirmed in the qualitative results.

To answer the second research question, Table 6 presents the descriptive data for vocabulary knowledge. It suggests that CALL technologies were mainly used to learn the meaning aspect of the medical vocabulary ( $M = 0 . 7 1$ , $S D = 0 . 4 6 )$ ), and it was also reported to elicit receptive knowledge $M = 0 . 7 1$ , $S D = 0 . 4 6$ ) more often than productive knowledge. Independent $t { \cdot }$ -tests were also conducted to explore the possible difference between the context of CALL and non-CALL regarding vocabulary knowledge learned by medical participants. Table 7 shows that CALL technologies were used more frequently to learn the meaning of medical vocabulary $M = 0 . 7 1$ , $d = 0 . 5 3 3 $ ), and assist medical students in developing more receptive knowledge ( $M = 0 . 7 1$ , $d = 0 . 6 0 3$ ) in comparison with the conventional condition without technological aids. These results can be explained as the actual levels and types of medical vocabulary knowledge that students acquired in a computer-mediated environment. Further evidence can be found in the interview data.

# Qualitative results

The qualitative thematic analysis of interview transcript data offers more insights into the integration of CALL technologies with VLS and vocabulary knowledge. With the assistance of CALL, the participants frequently mentioned translating new words with applications on their mobile phones as their cognitive strategies. For example, one interviewee reflected:

I also try to note down some characters which I have never seen and use Baidu1 to translate them into English.

These medical students also reported that they used their mobile phones to learn Chinese phonetics and calligraphy (strokes) of the new terminology repeatedly, such as writing a word by hand on their mobile phone screens or listening to audio recordings from mobile phone applications. One student shared a screenshot regarding the audio function of a vocabulary learning application, through which he listened to the pronunciation of the word diagnosis (see Figure 1). Another student mentioned that she was used to making notes on her smartphone in class because her attention was on recognizing and remembering characters, and with the help of CALL technologies, she could review the medical concepts and knowledge after class.

In the category of metacognitive learning strategies, CALL technologies were mainly reported to help learners focus on acquiring new terms from teachers’ instructions in class. For instance, one student commented:

Yes, when we were having real classes in China, I learned most of the words in the classes. I took photos of teachers’ PowerPoint slides and recorded the lectures. I listened to these audio files with the help of slides again after class.

Figure 1. T he screenshot of a vocabulary learning application.

Two students shared two slides (see Figure 2) from classes with most of the medical terms presented in both Chinese and English. In the first example, the word hemothorax was introduced with its three possible consequences being listed (minimal, moderate and massive levels). The second picture displayed the structure of a heart, to aid the students’ understanding of the terminology blood vessel, artery and vein. Students also participated in other multimedia learning activities to learn professional vocabulary, as can be seen in the following excerpt:

Interviewer: What kinds of movies did you choose? Medical movies?

Student: All kinds of movies. I watched a lot of them. Because I believe to learn medical Chinese, you have to be fluent in local Chinese too. Or else if you don’t understand much of what the patients are talking about, it doesn’t make sense.

For the categories of memory and social VLS, the former was occasionally reported by some students during their CALL experience to use images or sounds to aid long-term memory, and the latter was about communicating with native speakers. For example, as two students reported,

Laoshi2 send us videos and slides that she is teaching. In those videos she explains each medical word to help us to understand. I can have photographic memory which has helped me a lot.

I help Chinese friends on WeChat3 with their medical problems. Like this way I can practice a lot. I think these are good ideas.

Table 8, summarized from the interview transcripts, presents the integrated functions of CALL technologies with VLS. Most of them focused on cognitive strategies, followed by metacognitive, social and memory types, while the categories of affective and compensation were not mentioned by these medical students in the CALL environment.

For the levels of vocabulary knowledge, most students mentioned the acquisition of meaning level with the assistance of CALL while the form or use level were mentioned less frequently. Participants in the CALL context frequently mentioned using mobile phone applications’ translation and search functions to find accurate medical concepts in order to better understand teachers’ explanations and then to effectively acquire the terms. As two interviewees reported,

When we got to labs for experiment, we tried to learn some new words by mobile phone dictionaries. Like in lab we got forceps and syringe then we would translate these words from the dictionary and repeat these words every day.

When I started learning Chinese that time, those apps helped me a lot to understand the link between English and Chinese.

However, in terms of the form level, CALL technologies were mainly used to learn about pronunciation and shape, and students reported that they read and wrote characters repeatedly by following the examples from both textbooks and other printed learning materials or finishing tasks about strokes or phonetic symbols. As one student mentioned,

I usually write characters to learn, maybe listen to audio and learn to speak and pronounce from apps like Hanping. 4

Not many examples were reported about the use level, but a few students mentioned checking the usage of new words from audio dialogues, video resources and Chinese medical programs.

Regarding the types of vocabulary knowledge with CALL technologies, the students mentioned more about receptive knowledge since they listened to or read professional articles, and tried to understand the precise meaning in lectures or complete assignments with their mobile phones or installed applications. One student commented,

At that time, we won’t get time to note down things, after getting back to dorm, I will try to recollect the words with my translation app, and I focus on remembering characters, so that when next time I hear that word I could realize it.

However, they sometimes spoke out or wrote down acquired terms from lecture slides or audio files to better assist acquisition of productive knowledge. As one student mentioned,

I draw diagrams with my own and by checking videos of new words or the teacher’s PowerPoint to produce my word lists. Every Sunday evening, I read these texts along with the teacher’s slides.

# Discussion and conclusion

# VLS types

To answer the first research question, the results indicate that CALL technologies are most frequently reported to support cognitive and metacognitive vocabulary learning strategies. Firstly, a similar preference pattern in both the CALL and the conventional conditions can be interpreted from two aspects: (1) This study suggests a transfer of preferred vocabulary learning strategies from a traditional environment to a technology-mediated context without noticeable changes. CALL applications are not percieved as a useful approach to increase peer collaboration or social interaction (Golonka et  al., 2017; Rusanganwa, 2015), but only as additional opportunities to practice cognitive and metacognitive strategies; (2) It is difficult to remove the influence of CALL technologies on vocabulary learning in a non-CALL condition, as the CALL technologies have been rooted in students’ campus life for quite some time. Secondly, in the CALL condition, there is no application of memory, metacognitive or social VLS, unlike that in the non-CALL condition. This means that the techniques, including mnemonics, learning management and collaborative activities, cannot be taken for granted by students to make better use of CALL technologies. This also suggests that guidance and supervision from medical instructors may be needed to encourage learners to reap more tech-mediated benefits.

Moreover, the reported absence of affective and compensation strategies in the CALL condition can be explained from two perspectives: (1) the functions provided by CALL technologies in supporting medical students to learn terminology, and (2) the preference of Indian medical students to use CALL technologies in learning vocabulary. Regarding the first point, current CALL technologies in terminology acquisition are less likely to detect emotions in the communications with users and therefore, fail to provide extra assistance to reduce anxiety. As a result, it is normally instructors’ or peers’ responsibility to offer emotional support from the affective perspective (Chen et  al., 2020). For example, when learning medical vocabulary using an online dictionary, students can interact with their classmates by uploading comments, which may increase their level of motivation to achieve positive learning outcomes. The computer-assisted dictionary may not satisfy users’ emotional needs, but their peers could (Van de Poel et  al., 2013). Moreover, the current tech-based environment may be less likely to offer users opportunities to guess words intelligently, nor to provide sufficient linguistic resources for users to overcome their language limitations (Kocaman & Cumaoglu, 2014). This means that medical users still depend on the traditional environment to apply compensation strategies rather than turning to CALL technologies.

In relation to the two absent VLS, it has been found that Asian students and their instructors tend to avoid compensation or affective strategies such as use of imagery or comparision to students’ first language; instead, they favor cognitive or memory VLS such as the use of dictionaries, note-taking and repetition (Fan, 2003; Gu & Johnson, 1996; Schmitt, 1997; Vasu & Dhanavel, 2016). However, in a non-Asian context, Vorona (2019) has recommended the affective method by justifying the necessity of using the

Internet as a CALL environment in providing abundant multimedia resources and social network opportunities to increase medical students’ interest in learning Latin terminology. This affective strategy is equally applicable in the Asian context. More opportunities should be created for vocabulary learning and instructors should encourage their students to overcome linguistic barriers and take their emotional temperature with more computer-assisted support. In addition, the alignment between incidental learning and CALL is reported to be higher than the non-CALL condition, which suggests that CALL technologies can increase exposure to terminology and help students acquire vocabulary in an implicit and efficient way.

# Vocabulary knowledge

To answer the second research question, this study concludes that CALL technologies have been used more frequently to learn receptive vocabulary knowledge at the meaning level, rather than productive vocabulary knowledge at the levels of form and use. The underlying reason might be that second language medical students reported significantly fewer VLS in medical terminology acquisition in the CALL condition, such as social, compensation and affective strategies. As such, students might be reluctant to discuss medical topics with their instructors or peers in a more professional environment, and they also do not make an effort to infer terminology based on word formation, which both result in an inadequate repertoire of vocabulary knowledge (productive, form or use).

In the Asian context, the cultural barrier can explain why medical students only use CALL technologies to receive terminology in daily lectures or other classroom teaching activities. They are reluctant to activate or produce those acquired words in daily communication or personal reflection to achieve the balance of different types of vocabulary knowledge (Zhang & Pladevall-Ballester, 2021). Moreover, most of them plan to return to India to become local doctors when they may have to translate acquired medical knowledge from Chinese to local languages to communicate with patients or their colleagues. Therefore, they are likely to focus solely on receptive knowledge or meaning retention, rather than the recall (form) or production (use) aspect for future employment and practice. Lastly, the expected benefits of CALL technologies in vocabulary acquisition have not been achieved in the field of learning medical terminology, such as forming online learning communities and generating user self-made learning materials (Lee, 2019; Zou & Xie, 2021), to provide opportunities for students to stimulate speaking or writing skills, or to offer linguistic content support to improve comprehensive terminology knowledge.

The study has shown that students’ willingness and CALL application design are the main reasons to explain the reported preference for cognitive and metacognitive VLS. The results have also revealed the absence of compensation and affective VLS, as well as greater learning of meaning and receptive knowledge in the computer-assisted environment. Possible solutions may include a teacher-led learning approach to encourage medical students to make the best use of CALL technologies for linguistic or psychological support from collaborative learning. Another solution is to increase their engagement level at an early stage of using CALL technologies with a more functional and refined design.

A number of limitations should also be addressed. The first limitation is related to the small sample size, partly because of the inaccessibility of some volunteers. Only a small number of participants from one university participated in this study, and this can affect the generalizability of the findings to other contexts. Also, the study only used online semi-structured interviews for data collection and any additional information was not accessible due to COVID-19. The interview only invited the participants to explain three most freuqnelty used vocabulary learning strategies. The participants may have prioritised their answers and only provided a limited number of examples. As a result, some other CALL-facilitated strategies were not reported in the study. Future research can involve classroom observations, test scores, or triangulation of interview data with students’ actual VLS usage and vocabulary knowledge, to find out if their self-reported strategies are consistent with actual vocabulary learning practice.

Further research should collect student information, including their language proficiency and background in medical education. A longitudinal design could be employed to investigate differences in VLS use between high-achieving and low-achieving students, or the influence of other individual factors on vocabulary acquisition for a longer period of time, which has been investigated intensively in EAP (Fan, 2020; Zhang & Lu, 2015). Furthermore, future studies can compare VLS or vocabulary knowledge between western clinical medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, since the former is thought to be too demanding for international medical students in China in terms of oral language training, and the latter is suggested to relate to rote learning and is insufficient for cultivating creativity (Lam et  al., 2006; Li et  al., 2020). Finally, a multiple case study approach is warranted to investigate student perspectives of medical terminology learning processes.
