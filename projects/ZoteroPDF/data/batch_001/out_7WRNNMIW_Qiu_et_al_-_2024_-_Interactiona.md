Recent critical inquiries in metadiscourse research call into question the functional inadequacy of a word-based lexical approach. To account more fully the functional affordances of metadiscoursal features in academic writing, this paper examines the Interactional Metadiscourse, namely hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions based on a 2.64-million-word corpus of L1-English expert and L1-Chinese student writing in Agricultural Science. Through an intra-generic lens, we found a significant effect of partgenre on the use of all four target categories for both writer groups; and L1-English experts employed significantly more hedges than L2 students while L2 students used significantly more boosters and attitude markers. Functionally, both groups shared a largely similar deployment of functional subtypes across part-genres with L1-English experts outperforming L2 students only in one function: ‘stating a goal or purpose’ in self-mentions. Subsequent qualitative discourse-functional analyses at part-genre level between two writer groups explained some student-produced discipline-inappropriate metadiscoursal choices. This paper concludes with resources for a rigorous coding development, and implications for teaching metadiscourse to disciplinary writers with an emphasis on using available discipline-specific corpora to understand how functional taxonomizations of IM interface with socio-rhetorical contexts in disciplinary writing.

# 1. Introduction

For two decades, Interactional Metadiscourse (henceforth IM), an integral dimension of Hyland’s (2005) interpersonal model of metadiscourse, has received heightened interest in exploring the ways academic writers attend to their imagined readers as they compose their texts (Hyland and Jiang, 2022). Compared to the interactive dimension, IM is theorized to manifest a writer’s ability to establish an appropriate relationship with readers; hence, it is “more personal” (Hyland, 2005, p. 44) and can reveal their reader awareness more explicitly. As being key to persuading the audience without inviting undesirable negation from peers in the scientific community (Hyland, 2005), IM has been approached to uncover text-writerreader interactional features across various academic genres, such as research articles (henceforth RAs; del Saz-Rubio, 2011; Gillaerts and Van de Velde, 2010; Hu and Cao, 2015; Hyland, 2005), student essays (Hong and Cao, 2014; Lee and Deakin,

2016), and master’s and PhD theses (Akbas, 2012; Khoshsima et al., 2018; Kondowe, 2014). In particular, RA subsections have been examined to render a frequency profiling of IM markers in relation to rhetorical goals underlying each subsection as they embody different “degree of tentativeness, flexibility, and authorial engagement” (Abdollahzadeh, 2011, p. 295). While metadiscoursal features are present in all subsections of the research article (Hyland, 2005), the writers’ deployment of IM features to convincingly present their research activities and arguments depends on an appropriate understanding of the rhetorical intention of the respective subsection. For example, RA introductions may be profuse with self-mentions to comment on previous research (Harwood, 2005; Kim and Lee, 2014; Kuo, 1999), whereas RA discussions invite more hedging devices to mitigate presentation of research results (Liu and Buckingham, 2018). Such intrageneric variation, coupled with disciplinary conventions set by expert members of that discipline, delineates a distinct pattern of language use that underlies “expectations of particular cultural and professional communities” (Hyland, 2004, p. 148). Finding an appropriate way to meet these expectations, thus, poses great challenges to student/apprentice writers who have not yet been enculturated into the discipline-specific writing practice.

Contrastive analyses of IM features in student writing have been fruitful and have aimed at uncovering divergences in the writing practices of students with different lingua-cultural backgrounds. For instance, Hong and Cao (2014) examined the influences of L1 background (Chinese, Spanish, and Polish) and task type (argumentative and descriptive essay) on students’ use of IM features. With a similar interest in student argumentative essays, Lee and Deakin (2016) investigated the factors of writing quality and English nativeness in U.S. undergraduate students’ use of IM features. Kim and Lee (2014) recruited L2 disciplinary writers from a non-Western culture to study the effect of metadiscourse on essay quality. Moving up to advanced student writing, Hyland (2004) discovered that “socio-rhetorical context” (p. 141) which encompasses disciplinary expectations, rhetorical conventions of thesis writing, and “a reflective awareness of self, text, and audience” (p. 138) plays an important role in master’s and PhD theses.

Taken together, most studies of IM features in student writing subscribe to a native versus nonnative dichotomy and have contrived to reveal the effects of cross-cultural and cross-linguistic variations on the distributional characteristics of different IM categories in various types of discipline-general discourse. However, few embarked on investigating student/apprentice writing for publication purposes against a discipline-specific setting, where the discourse community entertains its own unspoken rhetorical and metadiscoursal system with specialized readership and expectations to qualify disciplineappropriate language use.

1.1. Motivating an intrageneric and functional perspective to interactional metadiscourse in RA writing

In the wake of recent critical inquiries into the methodological rigorousness of metadiscourse annotation (Akbas and Hatipoglu, 2018 - ; Hyland, 2017; Mauranen, 2023; Ädel, 2023; Ädel and Mauranen, 2010), corpus-based studies undertaking a “thin” approach (Ädel and Mauranen, 2010) are problematized as “superficial” (p. 3) for relying on pre-defined lists of potential items despite its apparent usefulness as a starting point (Hyland, 2005, 2017) and its potential to reach a broader generalization of the metadiscoursal phenomenon under scrutiny (Akbas and Hatipoglu, 2018 - ; Mauranen, 2023). Alternatively, proponents for a more discourse-analytic inductive examination proposed competing models for understanding metadiscoursal features in both written and spoken data (e.g., Mauranen, 2001; Ädel, 2006), which “precludes the use of very large corpora” (Mauranen, 2023, p. 46) and requires painstaking attention to the context-sensitive meaning of every linguistic feature. It is then not surprising to see that most metadiscourse studies adopt a somewhat “mixed” ground (e.g., Hu and Cao, 2015; Hyland, 2005; McGrath and Kuteeva, 2012), whereby the advantage of a word-based query is largely maintained (quantitative analysis) followed by a close textual analysis of representative texts (qualitative analysis). Some studies incorporated a genre-specific list derived from inductive reading of some sample texts to remedy the limited coverage of a pre-defined list (e.g., Hu and Cao, 2015; McGrath and Kuteeva, 2012), allowing for tailored solutions for specific rhetorical contexts. This way, the representation of metadiscourse can be reliably captured in a large collection of textual data while at the same time, a “thick” interpretation of differences can be applied given the contextual surroundings. Yet, such attempts often invoked different interpretational standards when comparing quantitative and qualitative results. To illustrate, McGrath and Kuteeva (2012) followed Hyland’s (2000a) pre-defined list of potential metadiscourse items to understand “social and disciplinary practices” (p. 162) of pure mathematics discourse community. The quantitative comparison yielded distinct deployment of metadiscourse features in pure mathematics obtained from word-based normed frequency counts; however, the functional analysis was carried out, as exemplified in the article, incorporating both small units (e.g., clearly, likely, useful) and larger units (e.g., at least in certain circumstances, the proof works by standard system arguments). While the larger chunk of metadiscourse still centers on a core word-based realization (e.g., standard is the search item for the proof works by standard system), it is not clear the extent to which the judgement was made based on coding of a single word or the semantics of a larger unit, which was shown to be difficult and arbitrary in coding hedging devices (Hyland, 1998a).

In sum, a brief review points out a few gaps in metadiscourse research on disciplinary RA writing. First, while RA sub sections have been well studied in previous corpus-based metadiscourse research, many either applied the interpersonal model to one or two subsections (e.g., Abdollahzadeh, 2011; del Saz-Rubio, 2011; Gillaerts and Van de Velde, 2010) or selected a few metadiscourse categories to RA part-genres (e.g., Hyland, 1996; Martínez, 2005). The effect of intrageneric (i.e., textinternal) variation on the use of IM in RA was underexplored. Second, previous IM research on learner performance has commonly targeted L2 English learners at various proficiency levels and L1 groups, whereas relatively little attention has been oriented to disciplinary student/apprentice writers (see Hyland, 2004 for an exception). Third, studies that have examined IM features by a “mixed” approach did not explore the full potential of list-based corpus searches and were not transparent in analyzing the functional affordances.

To address these gaps, this study aims to examine the use of four IM categories in a part-genre-segmented corpus of RA writing by journal article writers and graduate student writers in Agricultural Science. In this paper, we aim to address the following two questions:

(1) To what extent does the use of interactional metadiscourse features in published RAs differ from that in student writing with regard to intrageneric variation?   
(2) To what extent does the use of different functional subtypes of interactional metadiscourse features in published RAs differ from that in student writing with regard to intrageneric variation?

# 2. Corpus and method

# 2.1. Corpus description

The corpus used in the study is composed of 1,250 texts segmented from published research articles written by L1-English writers and 1,250 texts segmented from drafts of research writing for publication purposes by L1-Chinese graduate student writers in Agricultural Science (see Table 1).The sampling of HZAU expert corpus seems to perpetuate the bias that only the texts produced by L1 English writers can be considered representative of disciplinary discourse. However, we chose this corpus according to the pedagogical norms of Chinese English for Publication Purposes contexts, which acknowledge the use of L1 expert-produced RAs as exemplars to teach L1 Chinese students (Cai, 2018). We will revisit this potential limitation in our Conclusion.

Students texts were not externally edited, and both were balanced across nine part-genres of Agricultural Science (hereafter referred to as CASAW, Corpus of Agricultural Science Academic Writing). The texts in CASAW were sampled from HZAU CQPweb (Liu et al., 2015), an online corpus query interface built for EAP instructors in Huazhong Agricultural University. For the expert component, the HZAU corpus team collected empirical studies with clear and consistent macrostructure between 2004 and 2014 in refereed journals. Relevance and prestige were assessed based on factors such as their inclusion in well-regarded indexes like Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Rankings with priority given to those classified as Quartile 1 (e.g., Nature, Cell). Author control was carefully administered (see Liu et al., 2015 for compilation details). For the student component, the team collected for-publication manuscripts between 2010 and 2015 that were not externally edited based on students’ self-reports of their respective subdiscipline. Only papers with the most common RA macrostructures (e.g., Introduction, Methods) were selected to facilitate our investigation of intrageneric variation. We then used ‘create/edit subcorpora’ function afforded in HZAU CQPweb and sampled texts from 9 sub-disciplines with 250 texts from each section/ part-genre.

# 2.2. Extraction protocol of interactional metadiscoursal features

In our study, we opted for a more conservative approach to over-retrieving potential IM items using the list developed in Yoon’s (2017) Authorial Voice Analyzer which conglomerates lexical items derived from different models of metadiscourse (e.g., Aull and Lancaster, 2014; Biber, 2006; Hyland, 2005, among others). The advantage, as compared with Hyland’s (2005) list, is that Yoon’s list includes 989 items for boosters (174 items), hedges (164 items), attitude markers (640 items), and selfmentions (11 items), exceeding any of the previous IM lists, such as the 543-item list used in Tse and Hyland (2006). Following McGrath and Kuteeva (2012), we generated a supplementary discipline-specific list (44 items; see Appendix D) to capture “disciplinary idiosyncrasies” (p. 164) through an inductive reading of concordance queries of frequent verbs, adjectives and adverbs that were not included in Yoon’s list. We then computer searched for potential IM items using CQPweb query interface. Given the functional nature of metadiscourse and the consensus that a particular lexical form can be either propositional or metadiscoursal, every instance in our entire search list was first manually examined in its surrounding cotext to determine its eligibility (see Appendix A for criteria). In particular, we found that some potential metadiscoursal items were often collocated with conventionalized expressions and so treated them as propositional rather than metadiscoursal after consulting two L1 Chinese specialists in Agricultural Science. This includes verbs of hypothesizing (deduce, assume, theorize, postulate), adjective modifiers of technical expressions (absolute, perfect, putative, intense, significant) and adverbs of statistical or experimental reporting (highly, significantly, completely).

# 2.3. Functional taxonomy and coding development

# 2.3.1. Hedges

We adapted Hyland’s (1998a, 2005) tripartite model of hedges (accuracy-, writer- and reader-oriented categories) with more practitioner-friendly labels: Mitigating propositional precision or validity (hereafter, ‘precision/validity’ hedges), Mitigating writer commitment with impersonal attribution (‘impersonality’ hedges) and Mitigating writer commitment with personal attribution (‘agentivity’ hedges). ‘Precision/validity’ hedges (i) specify the extent to which the expressions qualify the accuracy of the proposition and limit the generalizability by restricting the scope, quantity, or degree of the proposition (e.g., generally, typical, approximately); (ii) express writer’s desire to present the uncertainty of their disciplinary knowledge (e.g., possible, somehow, may) through “willingness to address hard realities” (Hyland, 2005, p. 81). ‘Impersonality’ hedges (e.g., the data suggest, it was assumed) reflect a writer’s assessment or viewpoint of and commitment to the propositional claim while concealing his or her authorial presence by using agentless and passivized structures (Hyland, 2005). Lastly, ‘agentivity’ hedges tackle the relationship between a writer and readers (e.g., we suggest, seen as), seeking mutual understanding from the readers and aligning with the knowledge of the field.

# 2.3.2. Booster

Given that no existing functional taxonomy of boosters is available, we derived ours from Hyland’s (1996) hedging taxonomy and again adapted the three general categories with the following labels: Strengthening propositional precision or validity (‘precision/validity’ boosters), Strengthening writer commitment with impersonal attribution (‘impersonality’ boosters) and Strengthening writer commitment with personal attribution (‘agentivity’ boosters). While hedging devices help attenuate a writer’s imposition by foregrounding the subjectivity of the statement, boosting devices accentuate it which results in constriction of dialogic space for readers to (dis)confirm. Therefore, each strengthens a writer’s presence in, commitment to or viewpoint of the proposition. Specifically, ‘precision/validity’ boosters express the writer’s desire to attach greater precision and validity to a proposition (e.g., the most, completely, very). ‘Impersonality’ boosters highlight a writer’s commitment to and viewpoint of a proposition (it was found, the fact that, in particular) by using agentless and passivized structures. ‘Agentivity’ boosters demonstrate a writer’s explicit alignment with the reader, disciplinary community and the knowledge of the field (e.g., known, clearly, we found).

# 2.3.3. Attitude marker

We classified attitude markers (AMs) in our data based on three broadly defined subtypes suggested by Mur-Dueñas (2010) and later adopted by Hyland and Zou (2021): assessment, significance, and emotion. Accordingly, labels that read more pedagogically or practically intuitive were created: Expressing the writer’s evaluation of a claim or a situation (‘assessment’ AMs), Expressing the significance of a claim or a situation (‘significance’ AMs) and Expressing the writer’s affective position (‘emotion’ AMs). ‘Assessment’ AMs (e.g., problematic, sufficient, true) indicate the writer’s evaluation of the research or proposition under discussion and presents what the audience might find interesting or unusual. ‘Significance’ AMs (e.g., important, essential, significant) present the importance of the material, helping the audience who lacks enough knowledge to see the significance without help of the writer and building “an expert authorial persona” (Hyland and Zou, 2021, p. 10) who has sufficient knowledge on what they are doing. ‘Emotion’ AMs (e.g., surprisingly, unfortunately, intriguing) refer to markers used to display the writer’s affective or emotive stance, that is, personal feelings, rather than an assessment of an argument in an attempt to create the same sentiment in readers.

# 2.3.4. Self-mention

Following practices in Kuo (1999), Martínez (2005) and Molino (2010), we maintained both inclusive and exclusive we as a self-contained device because of the “fuzziness of the exclusive/inclusive divide” (Harwood, 2005, p. 345) and a lack of semantic distinction. According to Hyland (2002), self-mentions primarily perform five discoursal functions: (1) Expressing selfbenefits, where writers indicate what they have personally gained from doing the research, (2) Stating a goal or purpose, where writers signal the structure of their argument or the text or set a goal for future study, (3) Explaining procedures, where writers describe or explain their research procedures or processes, (4) Elaborating an argument, where writers establish a line of reasoning and suggest their own cognitive activity; and (5) Stating results or claims, where writers make a knowledge claim, foregrounding their contribution, performing sound interpretations and/or limitations. However, as Expressing self-benefits often enables writers to express personal gratitude, it normally occurs in the Acknowledgements (Hyland, 2002) and is not included in the analysis of the functions of self-mentions in the body of professional RAs (Walková, 2019). Therefore, we excluded this function from our analysis (see Table 2).

# 2.3.5. Coding protocol development and reliability testing

We began our identification of potential IM features using a pre-defined list (989 items) along with 44 discipline-specific items. However, coding functional subtypes involved a high level of subjective judgement, often based on larger units of meaning that extended beyond single lexical items. Therefore, it is important to be clear about what contextual information to be included for reliable functional coding. To this end, Table 2 and Appendix B share descriptions and concrete examples with underlined phrases with which to derive our coding.

For the functional taxonomization of four IM categories to be replicable, we developed a general coding instruction (Appendix A) and a coding scheme for each category (Appendix B). While each of the four authors was responsible for one category, we worked in pairs to code each other’s training dataset ( $1 0 \%$ of the data) and offered suggestions for revising the coding scheme. We followed an iterative process until each pair arrived at a workable coding scheme for each category, and then we finalized our coding instruction. To ensure accuracy and consistency throughout the functional coding process, we first assessed the interrater reliability for each category based on a testing dataset ( $1 0 \%$ of the data) using Cohen’s kappa statistics. The obtained kappa statistics were 0.816 for hedges, 0.805 for boosters, 0.891 for attitude markers, and 0.899 for self-mentions, indicating substantial agreement (Shrout, 1998). Secondly, each author performed a re-coding of the same data with a two-week interval and arrived at 0.910 for hedges, 0.900 for boosters, 0.966 for attitude markers, and 0.974 for selfmentions using Spearman’s rho statistics. These results suggested that the coding scheme was reliably and consistently performed by the coders for the classification of IM markers.

# 2.4. Data analysis

With the fulfillment of normality of residuals and Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances, the four target IM features were analyzed using a series of one-way ANOVA tests $\mathtt { \Delta } a = 0 . 0 5$ ) across part-genres (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion) and between two groups (L1-English expert vs. L2-English student) using a two-way ANOVA test $\begin{array} { r }  a = 0 . 0 5 \ \end{array}$ ) to detect their individual and interaction effects on the normalized frequencies (per 1,000 words), with their fulfillment of normality of residuals and Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances. The interaction is expected because the use of IM features is influenced by the writer’s familiarity with the rhetorical intent of each part-genre.

Original texts from the same subdiscipline within each part-genre in CASAW were collated to remedy the missing value in individual texts. As a result, we obtained 9 samples per part-genre and 45 samples per writer group. Post-hoc Bonferroni tests were performed with Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of 0.005 (0.05/10) to determine if a significant main effect of part-genre was observed. Second, a similar quantitative comparison across functional subtypes of each category was performed with Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of 0.004 (0.05/14) using independent-samples t-tests or the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests if variances was unequal, along with a list of most frequent items across subtypes.

Note: The boldfaced lexical item is our search item, and the underlined larger unit is the basis for our functional determination.

Motivated by the results of the quantitative analyses and functional taxonomies of each target feature (Table 2), we then carried out qualitative textual examinations of selected items, including close reading of representative instances of IM markers in context, identifying salient patterns of usage differences and similarities across part-genres and writer groups. The results will be presented following hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions.

# 3. Results and discussion

3.1. Overall distributional characteristics of interactional metadiscourse in CASAW

Figure 1 summarizes the distributional data of the four IM categories by part-genre and expertise in CASAW (see Section 2.4 for statistical tools adopted; see Appendix E for mean scores and standard deviation statistics). It should be noted here that some wide standard deviations in student use of self-mentions is largely attributable to polarized use across subdisciplines. Although this could potentially impair the reliability of statistical significance, we found no significant between-group differences across part-genres at the 0.05 level.

# 3.1.1. Hedges

The two-way ANOVA test detected a significant effect of part-genre, $F \left( 4 , 8 0 \right) = 9 3 . 2 3 4$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 7 5$ . Post-hoc Bonferroni pairwise comparison tests showed that Methods $M = 2 . 4 4$ , $S D = 1 . 4 8 $ ) employed the least hedges $\begin{array} { r } { p < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ ) than all other part-genres while Discussion $M = 1 3 . 0 3$ , $S D = 2 . 7 1$ ) and Conclusion $M = 1 0 . 8 4$ , $S D = 2 . 5 9$ ) included markedly more hedges than Results $M = 7 . 8 4$ , $S D = 1 . 4 6 ^ { \cdot }$ and Introduction $M = 7 . 8 0$ , $S D = 1 . 0 7$ ). On the expertise dimension, the test revealed a significant effect $( F ( 1 , 8 0 ) = 2 1 . 2 0 9 ,$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 9 ;$ ), where hedges were used more frequently by L1-English expert writers $M = 9 . 2 4$ , $S D = 4 . 1 9 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) than student writers $\cdot { \bf \dot { \it M } } = 7 . 5 4$ , $S D = 3 . 8 1 $ ). However, the interaction effect between partgenre and expertise was not significant, $F \left( 4 , 8 0 \right) = 1 . 7 0 9$ , $p = 0 . 1 5 6$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 9$ .

# 3.1.2. Boosters

The two-way ANOVA test found a significant effect of part-genre, $F \left( 4 , 8 0 \right) = 6 3 . 5 8 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 7 6 1$ . Post-hoc Bonferroni pairwise comparison tests showed that Methods $M = 1 . 6 4$ , $S D = 1 . 2 8 $ ) used the least boosters $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ than all other part-genres while Conclusion $M = 7 . 4 8$ , $S D = 1 . 7 3$ ) included markedly more boosters than Results $M = 5 . 3 5$ , $S D = 1 . 2 3$ ). On the expertise dimension, the test revealed a significant effect $( F ( 1 , 8 0 ) = 2 5 . 6 1 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 4 3 )$ , where boosters were used more frequently by student writers $M = 6 . 1 0$ , $S D = 2 . 6 2 $ ) than L1-English expert writers $M = 4 . 8 1$ , $S D = 2 . 2 1$ ). The interaction effect between part-genre and expertise was also significant, $F \left( 4 , 8 0 \right) = 3 . 6 3 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 1 0$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 5 4$ , indicating that students exhibited more pronounced boosting choices in Discussion and Introduction (Figure 2).

# 3.1.5. Interim summary

Among the four target categories, hedges were employed most frequently by both groups, suggesting that our apprentice writers were conscious of the need to tread carefully with the generality or assertiveness of their arguments. Expertise-wise, L1-English expert writers employed significantly more hedges yet fewer boosters and attitude markers than student writers. With regard to intrageneric distribution, both groups used IM most heavily in Conclusion and Discussion, followed by Results and Introduction, and finally Methods. The analysis also revealed significant interaction effects between part-genre and expertise in the usage of boosters and attitude markers, highlighting the varied rhetorical intentions in each metadiscoursal choice made by disciplinary writers.

# 3.2. Functional characteristics of interactional metadiscourse in CASAW

To index metadiscoursal items with an underlying rhetorical choice based on well-established functional frameworks, we carried out a functional analysis to obtain how student writers may have used IM in ways that either converge or diverge from L1-English expert writers. An overview of functional characteristics per IM category is shown in Figure 4 (see also Appendix C for frequency statistics). In Figure 5, we summarized intrageneric variation in the use of IM functional subtypes across partgenres and writer groups. Overall, we found neither consistent underuse of any IM subtype by student writers nor clear demarcation among subsections in realization of IM functions. We will unpack the distributional similarities and differences below.

# 3.2.1. Functional variation of hedges

From Table 3, no significant effect was found on expertise, suggesting that our student writers are capable of mitigating authorial commitment to knowledge claims or conclusions (‘impersonality’ hedges) and negotiating alternative explanations of hypotheses, methods, models and results (‘agentivity’ hedges). Taking intrageneric variation into consideration, we reveal below how certain rhetorical intents were accomplished through the differential preference for hedges.

Figure 3. Estimated means of frequency of attitude markers across part-genres.

While students seemed to exhibit expert-like hedging usage, we found interesting intrageneric variation where student writers underused ‘precision/validity’ hedging substantially in Discussion $( t ( 1 6 ) = 2 . 1 2 4$ , $p < 0 . 0 5 0$ , $d = 1 . 0 0 1$ ). Specifically, L1- English expert writers frequently exploited [it v-link ADJ that/to] with epistemic adjectives (likely, possible) to indicate what is possible given the conditions and offer tentative interpretations of the results; whereas, students resorted to [inanimate subject v-link ADJ that/to]. The use of ‘introductory it’ pattern as an important persuasive device in academic writing has been found to be salient across disciplines (e.g., Groom, 2005) and used less by student writers (e.g., Larsson, 2017). Therefore, we believe our student writers would also want to make more explicit attempts to highlight their softened commitment to the proposition.

For ‘impersonality’ hedges, both were able to tone down their language to protect their credibility and stave off negation. By taking advantage of speculative judgment verbs (suggest, indicate), sensory evidential verbs (appear, seem, tend to) and epistemic modality (likely, would), student writers fulfilled most rhetorical expectations required in each part-genre, such as withholding categorical endorsement to previous findings in Introduction and accounting for their (unexpected) outcomes in a tentative manner due to lack of solid evidence mainly in Discussion.

Lastly, ‘agentivity’ hedges were the least employed category. Admittedly, this category is known for being “extremely heterogeneous” (Hyland, 1998a, p. 179), whereby the realizations are not always at the word level nor explicit at surface structure. By taking a formal perspective, we nevertheless discovered that students have availed themselves of similar lexical repertoires to accept personal responsibility for their prediction, interpretation and contribution through speculative verbs (suppose, assume, suggest) in Results and Discussion. The rarity of such in both groups may suggest that writers in Agricultural Science restrained from claiming authorship of potentially untenable arguments, because of a disciplinary preference for conclusive statements over speculative arguments. Additionally, the combination of hedging modals (could) and emphatic verbs (conclude, find, show) were used in Results and Discussion by student writers to elaborate on the results (Example 1). While it is not uncommon to see an interplay of different IM features in the same lexical environment, a hedged emphatic expression entails a sense of fickleness in the veracity of the conclusion, thereby risking a relegation of an otherwise confident persona.

# 3.2.2. Functional variation of boosters

As can be seen from Table 4, both groups made more frequent use of emphatic devices, such as show, demonstrate, highlight, establish, to reinforce a categorical endorsement of the proposition. Notably, such assertive judgmental verbs were multifunctional and used frequently across three subtypes yet in different tense-inflected forms to express writers’ epistemic certainty of and commitment to the truth of their proposition. As for students, they are used predominantly in past tense (demonstrated, showed) as ‘impersonality’ boosters to introduce and reiterate the results of the current study mainly in Results and Discussion, accounting for the significant difference between two groups $U = 1 9 . 0 0 0$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 7 5 4 _ { , }$ ). In contrast, L1-English expert writers used present tense (establish(es), show(s)) to accomplish such function and to display ownership of the results of the current study (our results show) mainly in Results and Discussion.

The choice of tense reflects not only a grammatical understanding of the time point but a rhetorical consideration (Malcolm, 1987). By comparing Example (2) to (3), we can see that the L1-English expert writers strategically manipulated the summary of the current paper’s findings in such a way that transcends the binding of time, implying a “generic, timeless and omnitemporal generalization” of the proposed statement (Salager-Meyer, 1992, p. 103). Students, on the other hand, correctly denoted the time point when ‘the overexpression of LSM14A inhibited PRRSV replication’ yet, unwittingly or otherwise, left it as a specific past experience, which risks being negated in the present and future.

Ex. (2). Taken together, these results show that E. coli thymidine kinase is the enzyme [.] when T7 phage infects E. coli in the presence of ddT. (CASAW-E, 17ZWKX_RES)

Ex. (3). Taken together, these results showed that the overexpression of LSM14A inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells. (CASAW-S, 30DWKXS_RES)

In addition to emphatic devices, amplifying adverbs (particularly, highly, clearly) are used frequently across part-genres and mostly in ‘precision/validity’ and ‘agentivity’ functions. For ‘precision/validity’ boosters, adverbs, such as highly and completely, were used to fulfill the descriptive adequacy of a gradable statement (highly likely) or to strengthen the specification of an action (accurately analyze) mainly in Results and Discussion. For ‘agentivity’ boosters, writers were more comfortable to promote their authorial presence. Adverbs were used to orient readers’ attention to the specific part/attribute of a proposition (Example 4) mainly in Introduction and Discussion, to convey the writer’s attitude towards the expectation of the proposition (Example 5) mainly in Results and Discussion, or to elicit mutual understanding based on shared knowledge (Example 6) mainly in Results and Discussion.

While the preponderance of ‘agentivity’ boosters in student writing may suggest that they are aware of the need to establish solidarity through a stronger tone, the lexical realizations reveal some disciplinarily inappropriate usages. To convey greater certainty and at the same time align with readers’ knowledge, obviously was used, almost exclusively, by student writers to anticipate readers’ acknowledgement of a self-evident observation (Hyland, 1998b). Yet, such expressions carry an intrinsically vague and subjective connotation that deflects an otherwise clear and precise scientific message (Katz, 2009).

# 3.2.3. Functional variation of attitude markers

Table 5 shows the frequency breakdown of attitude markers by subtype and group, and exemplifies top 5 attitude markers. As can be seen, both groups used Assessment the most frequently, followed by Significance and then Emotion, which is congruent with the result found in Business Management RA writing (Mur-Dueñas, 2010). Moreover, we found both groups projected proportionally similar pattern of usage across part-genres for three subtypes: AMs were used predominantly in Discussion, Results and Introduction. In keeping with the rhetorical purpose of these part-genres, it is not surprising to see AMs were used to signal one’s “intertextual positioning” (Koutsantoni, 2004, p. 168), to show the extent to which the current results echo or contradict with previously established research, and to discuss the generalizability of one’s research (Soler, 2002).

While this surface similarity suggests our student writers have a good grasp of imposing rhetorically appropriate affective position onto their propositions, closer examinations revealed differences in subtype usage. In ‘assessment’ AMs, the use of evaluative expressions (e.g., help, successfully, novel) were found to occupy the Discussion (1032/3191) in L1-English expert writing as compared to Introduction (791/2562) in student writing. Such preference in itself may not call on students to leverage evaluative AMs in the service of crafting their own findings in Discussion, but we found that students did not seem to pick up the rhetorical potential, especially in the deployment of negative evaluative expressions, to problematize previous scholarly endeavors (Example 7), which is a useful rhetorical strategy to indicate a gap in knowledge in hard sciences (Stotesbury, 2003), or preempt possible criticisms by stating upfront the limitations (Example 8).

Ex. (7). Despite this knowledge, the role of TOY or EY in central neurons and mature photoreceptors is poorly understood (CASAW-E, 14ZWKX_INT) Ex. (8). As I discussed above, the sample size is significantly smaller and potentially biased. (CASAW-E, 40NYJJ_RES)

Note. Items with (ly/er) collate comparative adjectives and adverbial forms.

As for ‘significance’ AMs, both groups are quite homogeneous in that $7 0 \%$ of AMs are of the same lexical type (important) and used across part-genres in a similar fashion. The heavy reliance on a single word is also evidenced in Mur-Dueñas (2010) and Swales and Burke (2003), where important took up the lion’s share of ‘Significance’ (‘Relevance’) AMs in RA writing across disciplines. Finally, ‘emotion’ AMs, being the least favored in accordance with the “unemotional” tone in scientific writing (Katz, 2009, p. 1), were used only sparingly by both groups to achieve a rhetorical goal of promoting the value of the current study (compelling, striking) or projecting possible future directions (it is interesting to).

# 3.2.4. Functional variation of self-mentions

At first glance (Table 6), it may seem surprising to see that student writers’ use of self-mentions does not differ that much even as we broke it down into functional subtypes; an independent-samples t-test locates a significant effect only of ‘stating a goal or purpose’ on expertise, $U = 1 4 4 . 5 0 0$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 7 4 4 .$ . This is not in contradiction with previous research, where it has been shown that learners either overuse (Petch-Tyson, 1998) or underuse (Hyland, 2002; Martínez, 2005; Mur-Dueñas, 2007) first-person pronouns due to variables such as cross-linguistic influence, disciplinary variation and level of expertise. In ‘stating a goal or purpose’, student writers tend to display their agenda for subsequent projects (Example 9) at the end of Discussion and Conclusion (27/65); whereas L1-English expert writers primarily used it to ‘announce the research and findings’ (Swales, 1990) at the end of Introduction (93/138). One possible explanation for this divergence, albeit small, could be that offering a ‘teaser’ of what is coming next is not constructive for promoting the significance of the current study.

Ex. (9). Next, we will make arrangements for supplying vaccines according to the results of the model. (CASAW-S, 12SXJMS_CON)

In ‘recounting or explaining research procedures’ self-mentions, both groups patterned first-person pronouns with verbs that specify the means of experimental procedures. An abundance of this function in both groups echoes that writers in science and engineering learn to demonstrate and apply professional undertakings through documenting the methodological approach in a narrative fashion (Hyland, 2002). However, while both did so primarily in Methods and Results (1941/2635; 655/1200, respectively), there is a noticeable underuse of particular items by student writers (e.g., we used, we identified) in both subsections (see Appendix C for mean difference), likely due to reliance on passivized structures to disguise authorial responsibility to the methodological decisions. A follow-up inspection confirmed that use and identify in passive voice were more frequently used in student writing to carry out procedural specifics. Clearly, students are overly cautious about a subjective imposition on experimental objectivity and replicability. To make better use of this low-risk strategy, student writers should develop confidence in ownership of their “unique procedural choices” (Tarone et al., 1998, p. 119).

For the function of ‘stating results or claims’, the statistical similarity in our category contrasts with previous research on L1 Chinese writers’ conservative expression of self in advancing new knowledge (e.g., Hyland, 2002). Rather, we show that advanced student writers in Agricultural Science are comfortable with juxtaposing themselves alongside their findings and claims, foregrounding their commitment in the contribution of the study and willingness to seek recognition from the readers. Part-genre-wise, both groups used self-mentions primarily in Results and Discussion; however, students relied heavily on describing a hedged result or claim with modal verbs (e.g., could, may) to showcase their observations or arguments (Example 10). The use of hedging modals, sometimes together with inclusive we, is able to nudge a new knowledge claim into the disciplinary community (Li, 2021). Meanwhile, it weakens the distinctiveness of the contribution.

Ex. (10). According to the chart, we could find that k1 directly affects controlling the speed of the outbreak. (CASAW-S, 18SXJMS_RES)

Lastly, for the function of ‘elaborating an argument’, both groups used self-mentions similarly associated with a range of cognitive verbs. Quite expectedly, predominant instances were found in Results and Discussion, where writers should claim responsibility for new arguments that carry novelty to the respective disciplinary community (Martínez, 2005). Overall, this function is infrequent considering that Agricultural Science entrusts more to presentation of material evidence than cognitive reasonings. However, we found some useful phraseological patterns such as as we know, to our knowledge, we believe that, which may help position writers as knowledge producers. By doing so, writers can demarcate the source of knowledge claim and be protected from counterevidence (Hyland, 1996).

# 4. Discussion

# 4.1. Interactional metadiscourse use across part-genres in CASAW

This study identified a significant effect of part-genre on the use of all four IM categories for both writer groups. As shown in Figure 6, blue and grey areas are indicative of high ( ${ \tt > } 9 { \tt }$ occurrences per 1,000 words) and mid IM use (between 4 and 9 occurrences per 1,000 words), respectively, while low IM use ( ${ < } 4$ occurrences per 1,000 words) is marked by coral areas. We found predominant use of IM features in Discussion with Methods being the least interactional. This finding aligns with previous studies of rhetorical functions in RA Discussion (e.g., Hyland, 1998a; Lin and Evans, 2012), an RA subsection with a unique rhetorical intent different from that of Methods. This subsection allows writers to demonstrate meaningfully how their study occupies the niche, comment on findings, and present controversial claims through a dialogic reader-writer space. Conclusion subsections also abound with IM as evidenced in the mean scores across four categories, validating the rhetorical goal for providing the last chance to reiterate the overall strengths of this study (Yang and Allison, 2003). This sequence of intrageneric preference of IM was also evidenced in studies of IM in Dentistry (Crosthwaite et al., 2017), of hedges in Biology (Hyland, 1998a), of self-mentions in Biology (Martínez, 2005).

Another interesting finding is that by scrutinizing a larger pool of potential items (989 items) coupled with a disciplinespecific list (44 items) from close reading of text samples, we were able to identify frequently employed IM items (e.g., the most, particularly, strongly, great) in CASAW-E that were not shared in previous lists (e.g., Hyland’s (2005) list). More importantly, taking a conservative approach to extraction of potential items enables us to find that all four target categories occurred frequently across part-genres in our corpus, rendering a more reliable dataset for more robust quantitative comparisons.

As for group differences (cf. Figure 1), this study detected a significant effect of expertise on the use of three IM categories except for self-mentions. Student writers used significantly fewer hedges than expert writers, in line with findings reported in previous research (e.g., Crosthwaite et al., 2017; Hyland, 2002; Lee and Deakin, 2016). Meanwhile, they used significantly more boosters and attitude markers. This appears to contradict our earlier observation that our advanced student writers exhibited a noticeable degree of enculturation into the disciplinary community by employing IM in an expert-like fashion. However, a higher use of boosters in student writing has been well documented. Aull and Lancaster (2014) found that both entry- and upper-level undergraduate student writing in the U.S. contained more boosters (intensifying adverbs) than published academic writing. Similarly, Lee (2009) examined the metadiscourse across English native and non-native students in the UK and expert writing in Applied Linguistics and related fields, and discovered that both student groups used more boosters than experts. Thus, our disciplinary student writers have been fairly familiar with and capable of practicing English writing in accord with Anglo-American culture of tentativeness and caution (Hyland, 2005), but they are still underway to exert discipline-appropriate writer commitment to a proposition and balance between measured uncertainty through hedging and confident assurance through boosting.

# 4.2. Functional subtypes of IM across part-genres in CASAW

Overall, this study found that both writer groups effectively utilized all 13 functional subtypes of IM to achieve their rhetorical goals, with statistically significant differences identified in only three subtypes. Furthermore, when analyzed by part-genre, most of the functional subtypes were prevalent across all part-genres except Methods, which attracted only ‘Recounting or explaining research procedures’ self-mentions. On the other hand, Conclusion and Discussion showed a higher frequency of IM functions and were particularly rich in the use of ‘precision/validity’ hedges. Below, we present key findings on how different subtypes were used across writer groups and part-genres.

First, L1-English experts outperformed students only in one function: ‘stating a goal or purpose’ self-mentions. Student writers were generally hesitant to include signposting usage of self-mentions in Introduction to preview the research and findings. On the other hand, students managed to use more ‘impersonality’ boosting verbs to promote the significance of their own study predominantly in past tense. Such temporal preference indicates that students paid attention to the grammatical temporality of the research activity but did not pick up the pragmatic potential of tense in scientific writing to denote generality or timelessness through present and present perfect tenses (Malcolm, 1987). For the rest of the subtypes, though statistically not significant, we found students have the following areas of discrepancy to be improved: disciplineinappropriate word choices in ‘agentivity’ boosters (obviously), inadequate functional affordances of epistemic modalities in ‘impersonality’ and ‘agentivity’ hedges, lack of sufficient attention to an evaluative description of their own study using ‘assessment’ AMs, a reliance on passivized or pseudo active (with inanimate subject) structures to report the procedural specifics and study design in ‘recounting and explaining research procedures’, and lastly, a tendency to hedge a conclusive result or claim in ‘stating results or claims’.

Secondly, intrageneric difference shows generally that Conclusion is profuse with IM features and Methods is the least populated area for building up writer–reader interactions. It confirms past genre analyses of RA writing in various disciplines that Methods is, to a large extent, part of external realities (Hyland, 2005), while Conclusion embodies persuasive endeavors and promotional and careful presentation of the value of the textual reality. Additionally, writers in Agricultural Science deployed an abundant resource of hedges, boosters and attitude markers in Introduction to strategically modulate their epistemic commitment to the propositions and convey their evaluation or attitude towards previous literature, resonating with del Saz-Rubio’s (2011) study of the relationship between RA rhetorical macrostructures and metadiscoursal features in Agricultural Science. However, the absence of self-mentions in her corpus of RA introductions may be due to journal- or subdiscipline-specific overarching rhetorical constraint, where, in our corpus, some journals (e.g., The Journal of Agricultural Science) require a summary of experimental procedures and findings at the end of Introduction (e.g., we show, our data show). Recognizing such a continuum of interpersonality, we find L1-English experts are comparatively more consistent across functional subtypes, with notable exceptions in ‘precision/validity’ and ‘impersonality’ hedges and ‘recounting or explaining research procedures’ self-mentions. ‘Recounting or explaining research procedures’ self-mentions were used when writers dial up their presence to explicitly claim ownership of some novel methodological choices. Expectedly, it occurred primarily in Results and Methods and the least in Conclusion where an emphasis is given to the products than the processes of the research. ‘Precision/validity’ and ‘impersonality’ hedges occurred more in Discussion, suggesting that writers have a rhetoric-specific purpose of tentativeness in offering interpretations of the results or accounting for their (unexpected) outcomes. On the side of students, Conclusion surprisingly takes lead in ‘recounting or explaining research procedures’, where a close examination found that students seemed to be inappropriately restating/summarizing what they have performed. Taken together, we show that Conclusion indeed serves a different rhetorical function in RA writing (Lin and Evans, 2012) and therefore our students could benefit from target instruction on intrageneric expectations in relation to metadiscoursal functions.

# 5. Conclusion

This study investigates IM use in Agricultural Science. Regarding our first research question, we identified significant differences in all IM categories across part-genres, and between writer groups. Both used IM heavily across part-genres, with the highest in Discussions and lowest in Methods. Significant interaction effects between part-genre and expertise were found in boosters and attitude markers, indicating the underlying rhetorical intent within each metadiscoursal choice exercised by disciplinary writers. Functional taxonomization offers explanatory insights into writers’ metadiscoursal choice corresponding to its part-genre and expertise. Part-genre-wise, Conclusion has abundant IM features and Methods is the least populated area for engaging readers. Group-wise, student writers used significantly fewer ‘precision/validity’ hedges in Methods and Discussion, significantly more ‘impersonality’ boosters in Results and Discussion and were generally incognizant of signposting usage of self-mentions in Introduction to preview the research and findings. We provide below our contribution to a more transparent functional annotation in metadiscourse research, some pedagogical implications, and limitations.

First, in response to a growing interest in advancing transparency in reporting methodological choices and procedures, we share our team’s dedicated efforts in making possible (1) a general coding protocol for each category (Appendix A), (2) coding schemes for each functional subtype (including its relation to part-genre; Appendix B), (3) a discipline-specific list derived from inductive reading (Appendix D), and (5) the reporting of both inter- and intra-rater reliability testing.

Second, our analysis indicates discipline-specific instruction is needed on the micro-level language variations and rhetorical functions of IM across part-genres. The availability of discipline-specific corpora through CQPweb interfaces (http://114.251.154.212/cqp/; Hardie, 2012) enables teaching via queries of frequent IM in each part-genre to generalize rhetorical functions. Metadiscourse instruction could also be incorporated into EAP/ESP courses to raise awareness of genresituated usages that would otherwise go unnoticed (Hyland, 2000b). Additionally, disciplinary student writers could benefit from reading exemplary articles while attending to the “socio-rhetorical context” (Hyland, 2004) of key IM features, particularly modal epistemics, judgment and evidential verbs, evaluative expressions and first-person pronouns across partgenres.

This research is limited by the lack of metadata on participant experience, including years in doctoral training, international publishing, and study abroad. Generalizability beyond Agricultural Science is also limited given the single-discipline corpus. Most importantly, the exclusion of L2 scholars’ RAs limits the focus to a subset of the disciplinary community. One reviewer pointed out the confounding variable of language background in our expert-student comparison, so we gauged its role by benchmarking against an expert reference corpus of Agricultural Science RAs (Lü and Deng, 2020), which was compiled based on similar selection criteria except without controlling for language background. The statistical comparisons across three corpora revealed that all four IM features differed significantly between the L2-English student corpus (CASAWS) and both the L1-English expert corpus (CASAW-E) and the expert reference corpus. While this indicates language background may not have been as prominent a factor as writing expertise in our analysis, we recommend disentangling expertise and language background to formulate L2 learners’ challenges more directly along the axis of writing expertise in future research.
