# BALEAP news - Introduction to SIGs – June 2022

Since the launch of the first eight BALEAP Special Interest Groups in 2020, SIGs have not only weathered the storm of COVID but also flourished with three additional SIGs launching in the last two years. BALEAP SIGs are proposed and run by BALEAP members as a means to develop specific interests, share expertise and meet the needs of the wide range of practitioners working in the field of EAP. We now have eleven SIGs addressing:

• Specific disciplinary areas (STEM; Law; Creative Disciplines)   
• Language skills (Academic Listening)   
• Teaching modes and contexts (Technology Enhanced Learning; Transnational Education; Academic Literacies; Doctoral Education)   
• Common concerns (Social Justice; Testing, Assessment and Feedback; Teacher Education in EAP)

Created during the period of lockdown, SIGs have become truly versatile and inclusive online communities with an international membership spanning time zones and geographical divides.

We have invited individual SIGs to showcase their activities in this and upcoming instalments of BALEAP news – our first is:

# Transnational Education (TNE SIG):

The TNE SIG was set up early in 2020 with the goal of enabling EAP professionals working in transnational contexts to share their experiences and expertise. TNE, broadly defined as teaching and learning where students are based in a different country to an awarding institution, is a growing area of educational activity. With the UK alone having over 700,000 TNE students every year, EAP practitioners increasingly find themselves working in this context.

Like all the SIGs, we have many interests and concerns in common with the others and we are keen for there to be shared events and for BALEAP members worldwide to choose whatever event appeals to them - there is no need to be ‘exclusive’ about which SIG to join or whose workshop to attend. Those who do not work in transnational contexts might wonder what there is that is ‘special’ about this kind of context and whether it merits a SIG of its own. In many ways, TNE and ‘home’ EAP contexts are broadly similar. On the surface, at least, major programme features such as intended outcomes, course design, and materials development may even be the same. Nevertheless, our own experiences, in line with the published research, indicate that transnational is different.

For example, while both TNE and UK-based students have to transition from one education level to another and adapt to a different academic system, they differ in that the TNE students often have to deal with two systems at once. However, in arguably the ‘best of both worlds’, they are frequently offered a UK or dual degree in the student's own country. As most TNE partnerships generally involve a level of collaboration and exchange and require some mix of teaching teams from both institutions, a key difference is the ‘who’ and ‘how’ of teaching. This context brings a set of challenges, including those arising from differences in pedagogical approaches, insti tutional expectations, and quality assurance traditions. However, there is also the for potential for deepening our experience and examining our own positions – on education, on pedagogy, on EAP.

Another crucial factor is that the TNE context inevitably involves a blend of administrative and management teams which can provide the students with more support than they would have in an individual institution – or less. Both institutions may have to adjust to unfamiliar strategic and operational systems, and the EAP specialist may find themselves in the middle of two potentially conflicting or at least confusing ways of operating. They may even feel lost or isolated. Indeed, one aim of the SIG is to help members avoid the feeling of isolation that working ‘offshore’ might bring, and making sure that the parent organisation is more inclusive of TNE staff and students.

To date, we have held virtual coffee mornings and reading cafes and have had workshops on various topics such as:

• The opportunities and challenges of transnational working • The impact of Covid on our organisations

C. Heyns

• Establishing learning communities across borders • Student Voices: what do our students feel about student engagement

We have also recently expanded our committee, which has meant that our communication strategy is much better (see our website at https://baleaptnesig.com)

In the future, we would like to expand our global membership and continue the trend towards involving both sides of every partnership. As our Student Voices event was very successful, we would like to make this a more regular element.

In the ever-changing environment of international higher education, we hope to support colleagues as they respond to the chal lenges facing all of us in the spirit of flexibility, collaboration and innovation – themes that are so important in the transnational setting.
