# ABSTRACT

The role of practice has been largely overlooked in second/ foreign (L2) pragmatics research. Furthermore, very few studies have directly compared the effects of different practice contexts (e.g. practice in a telecollaborative context versus practice in a face-to-face context) on L2 learners’ pragmatic competence (e.g. in compliment responses [CRs]). Adopting the Skill Acquisition Theory (DeKeyser, 2015), the current study is the first to compare the influence of telecollaborative video-based practice and traditional face-to-face practice on L2 learners’ pragmatic competence in CRs. Sixty-five third-year college students from a university in China received instruction on CRs. After the instruction, they were randomly assigned to a telecollaborative video-based group or a face-to-face group. Thirty-three learners participated in three-week video-based telecollaboration with first language (L1) speakers of English via WeChat (a multi-purpose application including making video calls), whereas 32 students engaged in three-week face-to-face communication with the L1 speakers of English in a classroom. The results from multi-modal discourse completion tasks on the immediate and delayed post-tests revealed that the telecollaborative video-based group outperformed the face-to-face group in pragmalinguistic accuracy, fluency, and diversity of CR strategies, demonstrating a facilitative and long-term influence of telecollaborative video-based practice on L2 pragmatic development. Pedagogical implications for L2 instructors are discussed (e.g. incorporating deliberate, authentic, and engaging telecollaborative activities into curricula).

# 1.  Introduction

In the realm of second/foreign language (L2) pragmatics, most instructional studies have investigated the influence of a pedagogical intervention entailing a series of activities (e.g. consciousness-raising activities, metapragmatic explanations, practice) on L2 learners’ pragmatic competence. However, ‘what combinations are most effective is an untapped topic of research’ (González-Lloret, 2022, p. 184). For example, which combination is more efficacious in enhancing L2 pragmatic competence, instruction paired with telecollaborative practice or instruction combined with traditional face-to-face practice? Crucially, the role of practice has been largely overlooked in L2 pragmatics research (Li, 2019; Suzuki et  al., 2019). Practice refers to deliberate and consistent activities (e.g. role-playing, conversing with others in English) to help learners develop their L2 skills (DeKeyser, 2015). It is worth exploring the role of practice because the Skill Acquisition Theory (DeKeyser, 2015) and previous studies (e.g. DeKeyser, 2007; Li, 2019) have shown that deliberate and consistent practice is conducive to transforming declarative knowledge (i.e. knowledge of what) into procedural knowledge (i.e. knowledge of how). The proceduralization and automatization of pragmatic knowledge can help learners use L2 pragmatic features more accurately and fluently.

Furthermore, very few studies have directly compared the effects of different practice contexts (e.g. practice in a telecollaborative context versus practice in a face-to-face context) on L2 pragmatic competence (e.g. in compliment responses [CRs]). Empirical data in L2 pragmatics research are scant with respect to ‘the cause-and-effect relationship between L2 learners’ participation in technology-mediated contexts and their learning outcomes’ (Taguchi, 2021, p. 619). It is worth investigating the influence of different practice contexts because technology has played a prominent role in the field of L2 acquisition, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (UNESCO, 2020). Most schools around the world have experienced an educational and digital transformation and pivoted to online or hybrid instruction. The pandemic has accelerated the speed of the normalization of computer-assisted language learning and changed the nature of technology from playing a subordinate and unusual role to an indispensable and active role in L2 acquisition (Chun, 2016; Zhang, 2022). This impact may continue to influence post-pandemic language learning/teaching. Due to people’s heavy reliance on technology nowadays, it is important to explore which practice context or mode of communication (e.g. telecollaboration versus face-to-face communication) is more effective in helping L2 learners practice target pragmatic features.

Moreover, the limited number of studies comparing the effects of different practice contexts on L2 pragmatic competence revealed conflicting findings. Some studies have shown the advantage of a telecollaborative setting over a face-to-face setting (e.g. Sykes, 2005), whereas other scholars have found the superiority of a face-to-face modality over a telecollaborative modality (e.g. Tang, 2019; Details are discussed in

Section 2.2. Studies on Practice Contexts in the Domain of L2 Pragmatics). It remains unclear how practice contexts influence L2 pragmatic competence (e.g. in responding to compliments).

Given the inconclusive findings in the existing literature, by implementing the Skill Acquisition Theory (DeKeyser, 2015), the current study aims to contribute to the area of L2 pragmatics by extending the line of research on pragmatics practice and comparing the effects of two practice contexts on Chinese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) students’ pragmatic competence in CRs. This study is the first to directly compare the influence of practice in a telecollaborative video-based context and practice in a traditional face-to-face context in the field of L2 pragmatics (Details are discussed in Section 2.3. Telecollaborative Video-Based Practice).

Another focus of this study is the speech act of CRs. CRs were selected as the target pragmatic feature because they are prevalent but complex and face-threatening. One of the contributing factors is related to differences in cultural values (Zhang, 2021). For instance, Spencer-Oatey et  al. (2000) found that English speakers and Chinese speakers conceptualize appropriateness and politeness differently in relation to CRs; it was considered appropriate and courteous to deflect or decline compliments in Chinese culture to demonstrate humbleness, whereas it was deemed proper and polite to accept praise for first language (L1) speakers of English to show appreciation (More details are discussed in Section 2.4. Target Speech Act). Due to the complexities of CRs, it is worth further investigating this pragmatic feature.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Theoretical background: deliberate practice in Skill Acquisition Theory

Most instructional L2 pragmatics studies have adopted Schmidt’s (1993) Noticing Hypothesis, stating that to transform input into intake, L2 learners need to notice particular features in the input, for instance, linguistic forms, functions, and contextual cues. Empirical L2 pragmatics studies guided by other theoretical frameworks are scant. There is a clear need to augment the theoretical landscape and adopt other paradigms in L2 pragmatics research (Zhang, 2021). Doing so can give researchers new and multi-dimensional insights into the design and interpretation of research and provide practitioners with a wide array of rationales for pragmatics instruction (Chapelle, 2009). Different from Schmidt’s (1993) Noticing Hypothesis, the Skill Acquisition Theory (DeKeyser, 2015) more clearly explicates how the noticed pragmatic input is processed in learners’ minds by focusing on the cognitive process of transforming declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge.

The Adaptive Control of Thought-Rationale (ACT-R) (Anderson, 1993) is the Skill Acquisition Theory that previous studies on L2 practice have implemented. Specifically, the ACT-R postulates that skill development involves three phases. The early cognitive phase entails explicit learning of declarative knowledge, for instance, CR strategies that L1 speakers of English commonly use (e.g. accepting a compliment). Then, in the associative phase, learners utilize the declarative knowledge to practice the target action. Deliberate, consistent, and meaningful practice can lead to proceduralization, a process where procedural knowledge evolves (e.g. applying CR strategies to real-life communication). Since procedural knowledge encodes multiple steps involved in implementing the target action into one unified integration for processing, the accuracy and fluency of learners’ performance in the associative phase can improve vastly compared to their performance at the cognitive stage. Lastly, in the autonomous phase, a large amount of practice is needed to develop automatized knowledge (e.g. accurate, fast, and effortless application of the CR strategies), which increases both accuracy and fluency of learners’ pragmatic performance and ‘enables nearly error-free performance with complete spontaneity’ (Li, 2019, p. 117).

One thing worth pointing out is the essential role of deliberate practice in the ACT-R (Anderson, 1993). Deliberate practice refers to participating in learning activities with a high level of engagement (e.g. reflected by producing elaborate responses and asking follow-up questions) (Skinner et  al., 2008). As DeKeyser (2007) pointed out, deliberate and goal-oriented practice might capture learners’ ‘attention to new phenomena or engender new insights’ (p. 8). Prior studies have suggested that instruction combined with deliberate practice can help learners internalize and master newly learned skills and knowledge (Kellogg, 2008). In contrast, affected by factors such as learning contexts and student engagement, disengaged practice where students are not actively involved in learning activities has a negative influence on L2 acquisition (DeKeyser, 2007). Student engagement is defined as learners’ active involvement and participation in tasks. It plays a fundamental role in successful L2 acquisition (Dörnyei, 2019). The importance of student engagement echoes the Skill Acquisition Theory in that both ACT-R and student engagement emphasize that the automatization of L2 skills warrants deliberate and consistent practice that involves learners’ active participation (DeKeyser, 2007; Dörnyei, 2019).

In brief, the current study employed the ACT-R (Anderson, 1993) and investigated the proceduralization of pragmatic knowledge (i.e. the dynamic process of converting the stage of declarative pragmatic knowledge into the subsequent stage of procedural pragmatic knowledge), which is different from previous research adopting the Noticing Hypothesis (Schmidt, 1993) and only exploring one stage of pragmatic knowledge (i.e. declarative pragmatic knowledge) in a static manner.

# 2.2.  Studies on practice contexts in the domain of L2 pragmatics

A multitude of L2 studies in areas such as grammar (Suzuki, 2018) and pronunciation (Li & DeKeyser, 2017) have shown that ‘deliberate, systematic, and extensive practice (often accompanied by explicit instruction) results in proceduralization and automatization of linguistic knowledge’ (Suzuki et  al., 2019, p. 553). However, the role of practice in the field of L2 pragmatics ‘has rarely been investigated’ (Li, 2019, p. 118). More L2 practice studies from other linguistic areas (e.g. pragmatics) are called for to examine the generalizability of prior findings (Suzuki et  al., 2019).

The small body of the literature on L2 pragmatics practice has concentrated on two directions: (a) the amount of practice (Li, 2012) and (b) practice modalities (e.g. input-based practice versus output-based practice) (Li & Taguchi, 2014). Crucially, very few studies have compared the influence of different practice contexts on L2 learners’ pragmatic competence (Sykes, 2005; Tang, 2019). As DeKeyser (2018) pointed out, it is important to examine ‘what practice activities are best for whom, for what structures, for which skill at what time and in what context’ (p. xv). Moreover, a handful of researchers have found that ‘the mode of communication does indeed affect L2 pragmatic production’ (González-Lloret, 2019, p. 117). More studies in this direction are needed to help researchers and practitioners gain a better grasp of the affordances of different contexts or means of communication for L2 pragmatics teaching/learning (González-Lloret, 2019). Additionally, a small quantity of studies reported that L2 learners’ perceptions of in-person and online instruction have changed drastically owing to the COVID-19 pandemic (Meşe & Sevilen, 2021). Therefore, we need to further investigate which practice context (e.g. telecollaborative practice versus traditional face-to-face practice) is more effective in facilitating L2 pragmatics acquisition during the pandemic, which may continue to affect post-pandemic L2 education.

Furthermore, the small number of prior studies comparing the effects of different practice contexts have reported mixed findings. For instance, Sykes (2005) examined how L2 learners of Spanish performed the speech act of refusals in CMC audio-based, CMC text-based, and traditional face-to-face settings. The results of role plays showed that the CMC text-based group adopted more diverse and complex refusal strategies than the traditional face-to-face group and the CMC audio-based group, indicating the advantage of a CMC text-based modality in enhancing L2 pragmatic competence. The text-based group’s improvement might be explained by less real-time pressure and more planning time they had (Sykes, 2005). In contrast, a more recent study conducted by Tang (2019) found the superiority of a face-to-face setting over a telecollaborative setting. She examined how L2 students learned the pragmatic aspects of modal verbs in Mandarin Chinese (e.g. using modal verbs to make a request). The results of decision-making tasks on a production test revealed that the face-to-face group’s score was significantly higher than the CMC text-based group’s score on the delayed post-test, suggesting the benefits of a face-to-face modality for promoting L2 pragmatic competence. The face-to-face group’s improvement might be attributable to their frequent application of the modal verbs at the stage of the intervention. The CMC text-based group tended to utilize emoticons instead of the modal verbs, whereas the face-to-face group was inclined to produce complete sentences entailing the modal verbs (Tang, 2019).

In addition to the mixed findings regarding the effectiveness of different practice contexts in L2 pragmatic competence, from a methodological perspective, very few studies have administered a delayed post-test to examine the lasting effects of practice contexts on L2 learners’ pragmatic development. Among the aforementioned studies, only Tang (2019) incorporated a delayed post-test. However, the two-week interval between the immediate post-test and the delayed post-test was short. More studies with longer intervals are called for to further investigate the long-term efficacy of different practice contexts in L2 pragmatic development. Thus, the current study employed a five-week delayed post-test.

# 2.3.  Telecollaborative video-based practice

Note that none of the referenced studies comparing the effects of different practice contexts on L2 pragmatic competence explored telecollaborative video-based practice, which refers to having face-to-face communication via an electronic device. Video-based CMC research is sparse in the field of L2 acquisition (Canals et  al., 2021), let alone in the domain of L2 pragmatics.

Although video-based telecollaboration may not decrease real-time cognitive pressure as text-based telecollaboration does, the fast-paced communication in video-based telecollaboration may contribute to L2 learners’ fluency development (i.e. procedural knowledge) (Hung & Higgins, 2016). In fact, a handful of studies in the literature on L2 acquisition have shown the effectiveness of video-based telecollaboration.

For instance, the results of picture description tasks in Saito and Akiyama (2017) study revealed the positive effects of video-based telecollaboration on Japanese EFL learners’ fluency and grammatical accuracy. In addition to the efficacy of video-based telecollaboration in fluency and grammatical accuracy, Freiermuth and Huang (2021) found the benefits of video-based telecollaboration for promoting EFL learners’ intercultural competence (e.g. using polite language). To my best knowledge, the current study is the first to directly compare the influence of practice in a telecollaborative video-based context (encompassing audiovisual information) and practice in a traditional face-to-face context on L2 pragmatic competence. It is crucial to examine this topic since the implementation of video-based CMC has increased exponentially since the COVID-19 pandemic (Zhang, 2022). Moreover, previous studies have shown that the visual presence of an interlocutor may influence a speaker’s linguistic choices by taking into consideration face maintenance (e.g. avoiding threatening the other interlocutor’s face) (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Freiermuth & Huang, 2021).

To conclude, due to the under-researched area in investigations of telecollaborative video-based practice, the limited and mixed findings germane to the effects of different practice contexts on L2 pragmatic development, and the lack of delayed post-tests in the prior studies, the present study intends to contribute to the research on L2 pragmatics practice by comparing the influence of telecollaborative video-based practice on WeChat (a free multi-purpose application including making video calls) and traditional face-to-face practice on L2 learners’ pragmatic competence in CRs. Additionally, the current study incorporated a delayed post-test five weeks after the immediate post-test to explore the durable efficacy of different practice contexts in L2 pragmatic development. From a theoretical standpoint, this study intends to expand the theoretical range by adopting a less commonly employed paradigm in the field of L2 pragmatics: the Skill Acquisition Theory (DeKeyser, 2015).

# 2.4.  Target speech act: replying to compliments in Mandarin Chinese and English

Almost all prior studies investigating the role of practice in L2 pragmatic competence have focused on requests (Li, 2012; Li & Taguchi, 2014). Few studies have explored how EFL learners implement other speech acts (e.g. replying to praise). Compliment responses are worth exploring for several reasons. First, formulaic expressions such as CRs can increase speech fluency (Bardovi-Harlig, 2009) and function as social grease with members of the speech community (Zhang, 2021). Second, adopting target-like CRs is helpful for establishing common ground and tacit agreement among interlocutors who come from a variety of cultural backgrounds and use English as a lingua franca to conduct intercultural communication (Kecskes, 2007). Although performing speech acts (e.g. responding to praise) is universal, the forms used to realize the speech acts differ from culture to culture. For instance, Kim (2014) found that Korean L2 learners of English felt uncomfortable saying ‘thank you’ and directly accepting praise in English. Different cultural values may result in misunderstandings, which can be perilous because interlocutors ‘might attribute the breakdown not to linguistic causes, but to personality (individual or cultural) causes’ (Gass et  al., 2020, p. 372). Adopting formulaic pragmatic expressions (e.g. CRs) in English can establish common ground, promote rapport, and reduce the likelihood of creating miscommunication (Kecskes, 2007; Tang & Taguchi, 2021). Third, the existing literature has revealed that many L2 learners, including proficient L2 users, are not cognizant of the pragmatic dimension of the target language (Gass et  al., 2020). Hence, it is necessary to first equip learners with pragmatic knowledge and help them at least be conscious of how L1 speakers of English respond to compliments. Then, learners can make informed pragmatic decisions.

The importance of CRs is also reflected by a growing number of studies comparing Chinese speakers’ CRs and English speakers’ CRs (Chen, 1993; Rose, 2000; Spencer-Oatey et  al., 2000; Zhang, 2021). Three primary strategies used to respond to compliments have been categorized as acceptance, denial, and deflection (Chen & Yang, 2010). For instance, Chen (1993) reported that Xi’an Chinese speakers were more likely to decline or deflect positive comments, which might be explained by Leech’s (1983) Modesty Maxim (i.e. minimizing self-praise). However, speakers of American English showed a preference for the acceptance strategy, which might be motivated by Leech’s (1983) Agreement Maxim (i.e. maximizing agreement between a complimenter and a complimentee). Furthermore, Spencer-Oatey et  al. (2000) discovered that English speakers and Chinese speakers conceptualize appropriateness and politeness differently in relation to CRs; it was regarded as felicitous and courteous to deflect or decline positive comments in Chinese culture to avoid self-praise and demonstrate humbleness, whereas it was considered proper and polite to accept compliments for L1 speakers of English to show appreciation. In contrast, by carrying out oral production tasks, Rose (2000) reported that speakers of Cantonese Chinese in Hong Kong were inclined to employ the acceptance strategy rather than the denial and deflection strategies. Similar findings were found in Zhang’s (2021) study. The results based on naturalistic interactive data revealed that Chinese EFL learners, who were speakers of Mandarin Chinese from northern China, tended to accept praise. These studies have shown not only cultural differences in responding to compliments between Chinese speakers and English speakers but also regional variability among different groups of Chinese speakers.

Altogether, on account of the importance of CRs to intercultural communication and the complexities of CRs (e.g. due to cultural differences and regional pragmatic variation), it is necessary to investigate CRs, acquaint L2 learners with knowledge concerning formulaic CRs in English, and help them conduct effective intercultural communication, build common ground, and achieve mutual understanding (Tang & Taguchi, 2021; Zhang, 2021).

# 3.  The present study

This study compared the influence of practice in a telecollaborative video-based context and practice in a face-to-face context on Chinese EFL students’ pragmatic development in utilizing CRs. The current study aims to identify the affordances of these two practice contexts in a comprehensive manner by assessing (a) pragmalinguistic accuracy (i.e. learners’ accurate implementation of the linguistic tools to perform the speech act of CRs), (b) fluency, and (c) the diversity of CR sub-strategies. Thus, this study addresses these three research questions (RQs):

1. Do different practice contexts (i.e. practice in a telecollaborative video-based context versus practice in a traditional face-to-face context) affect the pragmalinguistic accuracy (i.e. declarative knowledge) and fluency (i.e. procedural knowledge) of Chinese EFL learners’ CRs?   
2. Is the effectiveness of practice in a telecollaborative video-based context or practice in a traditional face-to-face context long-term with respect to improving Chinese EFL learners’ pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency?   
3. Do different practice contexts (i.e. practice in a telecollaborative video-based context versus practice in a traditional face-to-face context) affect the diversity of the CR sub-strategies that Chinese EFL learners employ?

# 4.  Method

# 4.1.  Participants and context

This study was conducted in China in 2021, when all schools and universities were re-open due to fewer COVID-19 cases across the country. Sixty-five third-year college students (33 females, 32 males) from an

EFL speaking class at a public university in China were recruited. Their ages ranged from 20.1 to 23.6 years $\langle M _ { a g e } \ = \ 2 1 . 3 )$ . They were from northern China (i.e. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Shanxi). All students were intermediate EFL learners according to their scores on TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) $\mathbf { \zeta } M = 8 5 . 5 9$ , $S D = 3 . 7 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). In addition, a pre-experiment questionnaire demonstrated that none of them had lived in an English-speaking country, and they all planned to gain their master’s degrees in the United States after graduation. Furthermore, the participants’ responses in the questionnaire showed that the target speech act was not included in their focused instruction (e.g. metapragmatic instruction). The interviews with their EFL teachers also showed that their focused instruction did not incorporate different types of CR strategies. Additionally, all learners felt comfortable with either a traditional face-to-face modality or a video-based modality.

All participants received explicit instruction pertinent to CRs. After the instruction and the pre-test, they were randomly divided into two groups. Specifically, 33 learners participated in practice via video-based telecollaboration (VT) with L1 speakers of English on WeChat for three weeks, while 32 students partook in practice in a face-to-face (FTF) context with the L1 speakers of English in a classroom for three weeks.

Thirty-three L1 speakers of English (17 females, 16 males, $M _ { a g e } =$ 23.5) who were American exchange students from another public university in China participated in this study as interlocutors at the intervention stage. They were born and grew up in the United States (eight African Americans and 25 Caucasian Americans). They talked with the VT group on WeChat and conversed with the FTF group in a classroom. During each of the three practice sessions, one American interlocutor was randomly assigned to chat with one EFL learner every week.

The instruction on CRs was delivered in a classroom by the researcher.

# 4.2.  Instructional materials

Two handouts were provided for all learners. The first handout contained four pairs of short dialogues displayed in Appendix A. Each pair incorporated a formulaic CR in English (i.e. acceptance) and an unconventional CR (i.e. deflection or denial). The four dialogues were connected to the four most common situations for people to provide praise, encompassing capability, clothing/physical traits, personality, and possessions (Chen, 1993). The second handout detailed 13 CR sub-strategies under three main types: acceptance, deflection, and denial (Chen & Yang, 2010) for the purpose of equipping the learners with explicit metapragmatic information regarding CRs (see Appendix B).

# 4.3.  Procedure

Table 1 presents the timeline of this ten-week study.

Regarding Week 1’s training, to guarantee the quality of each practice session, the researcher explained explicitly to the American interlocutors concerning the procedures and suggestions on how to naturally pay four positive comments during each practice session (one compliment on each of these four categories: capability, clothing/physical traits, personality, and possessions).

During Week 2, all learners attended a 100-minute lecture in a classroom. The instruction began with an awareness-raising activity where the students were given the first handout and were asked to underline the CRs that they thought L1 speakers of English would say. Subsequently, the instructor provided the students with explicit metapragmatic explanations with respect to formulaic CRs in English and 13 CR sub-strategies (i.e. declarative pragmatic knowledge). After the instruction, the students were anticipated to master the declarative knowledge, which was reflected by the pragmalinguistic accuracy of their CRs. In other words, the learners were expected to respond to praise by adopting the thanking strategy combined with another sub-strategy under the main category of acceptance (e.g. expressing gladness), just like L1 speakers of English (Zhang, 2021). An example of a target-like CR is ‘Thanks. I’m glad to hear that you enjoyed my presentation.’

Then, the learners completed multi-modal discourse completion tasks (MMDCTs) as the pre-test (More information regarding MMDCTs is discussed in Section 4.4. Instrument). The purpose of the pre-test was to evaluate the EFL learners’ initial knowledge of CRs in English and to make sure that they had solid declarative pragmatic knowledge before proceeding to the practice stage. After the pre-test, the participants were randomly divided into a VT group or an FTF group.

Table 2. T opics of the practice sessions.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Practice session</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Theme</td><td>Friendship</td><td>Fashion</td><td>Food</td></tr></table></body></html>

During the following three weeks, the VT group practiced CRs via video-based telecollaboration with the L1 speakers of English on WeChat, whereas the FTF group had weekly face-to-face practice with the L1 speakers of English in a classroom. The themes of the three weekly conversations were chosen from the participants’ coursebooks (see Table  2). To assist the American interlocutors in naturally paying four positive comments to the two groups throughout each practice session, the EFL students were told to prepare three digital or printed photos congruent with the three themes of the practice sessions. During each session, an EFL learner shared one picture with an American student. For example, when the topic was friendship, an EFL student might show his/her American interlocutor an image of a friend. The two groups’ practice sessions were videotaped.

To explore the immediate influence of practice contexts on the pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency of Chinese EFL learners’ CRs, both groups completed an immediate post-test after the third practice session. Furthermore, to investigate the long-term effectiveness of practice in a telecollaborative video-based or traditional face-to-face setting, five weeks later, both groups completed a delayed post-test.

# 4.4.  Instrument: multi-modal discourse completion tasks

Despite being one of the most widely used assessment tools to measure pragmatics performance, discourse completion tasks (DCTs) possess limitations in many respects. For example, clear contextual cues (e.g. the relationship between interlocutors) are usually absent from DCTs (Sykes & González-Lloret, 2020). Consequently, data gathered from DCTs might not reflect real-life communication (Golato, 2003). Nevertheless, DCTs have several advantages. For instance, they enable researchers to easily collect data directly related to the target pragmatic feature while controlling for extraneous variables (e.g. power) (Golato, 2003).

To address the limitations of traditional DCTs, the three tests in the present study adopted MMDCTs (i.e. entailing text-formatted prompts, visual cues via pictures, and audio-based dialogues). Specifically, each target test item contained an incomplete dialogue involving compliments and CRs. To provide contextual cues, a prompt in each MMDCT delineated clear contextual information (e.g. background information, the relationship between interlocutors). Moreover, a relevant picture was incorporated to supply more contextualization (Brown & Abeywickrama,

2018). After 20 seconds, the prompt, picture, and dialogue disappeared. The learners were instructed to speak to the laptops. Their responses were recorded through the laptops’ built-in microphones. Figure 1 presents a sample MMDCT.

Moreover, to avoid practice effects, three parallel tests were designed for the pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test. The three tests were counterbalanced across the three testing phases between the VT group and the FTF group. The internal reliability of each test was high (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient $=$ .83, .86, and .85, respectively). Each test consisted of 30 MMDCTs. Specifically, 16 of them were target test items (i.e. four items per each of these four praise-related situations: capability, clothing/physical traits, personality, and possessions) (Chen, 1993), and 14 test items were distractors (e.g. greetings). The order of the test items was randomized. In addition, to guarantee that each target test item successfully elicited CRs, each MMDCT was piloted with 23 L1 speakers of English and 11 advanced L2 speakers of English. The target test items on the three tests elicited CRs from all the L1 and L2 speakers (i.e. accepting compliments).

# 4.5.  Data analysis

The first RQ asked whether practice contexts (i.e. practice in a telecollaborative video-based context versus practice in a traditional face-to-face context) affect the pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency of Chinese EFL learners’ CRs. First, to assess pragmalinguistic accuracy (i.e. declarative pragmatic knowledge), a modified five-level rubric in Zhang’s (2021) research was adopted in this study (see Table 3). With 16 target test items on the pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test, respectively, the scores of each test ranged from 0 to 64. Three raters with Ph.D. degrees in Applied Linguistics scored the data independently. They had training and norming to ensure the reliability of their judgments. Fleiss’ kappa showed high inter-rater reliability among the raters for all three tests: pre-test (.92), immediate post-test (.94), and delayed post-test (.95). An independent samples $t { \cdot }$ -test was administered to investigate the between-group differences in pragmalinguistic accuracy on the immediate post-test. Moreover, the effect size of the between-group contrast was calculated $\mathrm { ( s m a l l ~ = ~ . 4 0 ~ }$ , medium $\ c = \phantom { - } . 7 0$ , large $\mathit { \Theta } = \ 1 . 0 0 $ ) (Plonsky & Oswald, 2014).

In addition to pragmalinguistic accuracy, fluency (i.e. procedural pragmatic knowledge) of the learners’ CRs was assessed through speech rates, which were measured by the average number of uttered English syllables of a CR per second, excluding repairs, repetitions, and false starts (Derwing et  al., 2009). This temporal measure expands the traditional analyses of target pragmatic features with a single focus on accuracy and offers a complementary way to examine L2 pragmatic production by evaluating fluency, which is often overlooked in L2 pragmatics research (Li & Taguchi, 2014). An independent samples $t { \cdot }$ -test was conducted to examine the between-group differences in fluency on the immediate post-test. The effect size was calculated.

The second RQ explored whether the effectiveness of practice in a telecollaborative video-based or face-to-face context is durable over time with respect to pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency. A paired samples $t { \cdot }$ -test was administered to examine the distinctions between the pre-test CRs and the delayed post-test CRs within each group. Moreover, the effect size of the within-group contrast was calculated $\mathrm { ( s m a l l ~ = ~ . 6 0 , }$ medium $= 1 . 0 0$ , large $= 1 . 4 0 \}$ (Plonsky & Oswald, 2014). Additionally, an independent samples $t$ -test was carried out to explore whether there was a noticeable difference between the VT group’s CRs and the FTF group’s CRs on the delayed post-test. To avoid a Type I error, the significance level was set at .017 $\mathit { \Pi } _ { \mathrm { ~ a ~ } } = \mathit { \Pi } . 0 5 / 3$ ) by using the Bonferroni adjustment.

The third RQ asked whether practice contexts (i.e. practice in a telecollaborative video-based context versus practice in a traditional face-toface context) affect the diversity of the CR sub-strategies that Chinese EFL learners adopt. All CRs on the three tests were coded for 13 subsets subsumed by three major categories (Chen & Yang, 2010; a) acceptance (e.g. expressing appreciation: ‘Thank you.’), (b) deflection (e.g. expressing doubt: ‘Does the scarf really look that good?’), and (c) denial (e.g. expressing disagreement: ‘No. It doesn’t look that nice.’). The percentage of each CR sub-strategy was calculated by three trained raters (the inter-rater reliability for each sub-strategy $>$ .89).

Prior to running the parametric tests, Shapiro-Wilk tests were conducted, revealing that the data were normally distributed $\mathrm { ( \it { p s } \ > \ . 0 5 ) }$ . Levene’s tests were also carried out, showing that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was met $\left( p s > . 0 5 \right)$ . Furthermore, an analysis of the pre-test data was conducted before addressing the three RQs for the purpose of examining whether there were pre-existing differences between the two groups on the pre-test regarding pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency. The results from an independent samples $t$ -test revealed no significant difference in pragmalinguistic accuracy between the VT group’s CRs $M = 5 5 . 9 6$ , $S D = 4 . 3 8 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ) and the FTF group’s CRs $\mathit { \Delta } M = 5 7 . 8 1$ , $S D = 3 . 5 9 _ { , }$ ) on the pre-test, $t ( 6 3 ) = 1 . 8 5 4$ , $p = . 0 6 8$ . Moreover, the results from an independent samples $t$ -test showed no noticeable difference in fluency between the VT group’s CRs $M = 2 . 7 1$ , $S D = . 2 9 ,$ ) and the FTF group’s CRs ( $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 2 . 7 3$ , $S D = . 3 8 )$ ) on the pre-test, $t ( 6 3 ) = . 3 0 2$ , $p = . 7 6 4$ .

# 5.  Results

This section reports the results in three respects: (a) the immediate effects of the two practice contexts, (b) the long-term effectiveness, and (c) the diversity of CR sub-strategies.

# 5.1.  Immediate effects of practice contexts on L2 pragmatic competence

First, regarding the immediate influence of practice contexts on pragmalinguistic accuracy, Table 4 displays the descriptive statistics of the two groups’ scores on the pre-test and the immediate post-test. The results from an independent samples $t { \cdot }$ -test demonstrated that the VT group $M = 5 9 . 7 4$ , $S D = 3 . 3 8 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ ) significantly outperformed the FTF group $M = 4 7 . 6 7$ , $S D = 7 . 3 0 $ ) on the immediate post-test with regard to pragmalinguistic accuracy, $t ( 6 3 ) = 8 . 6 0 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $d = 2 . 1 3 4$ , suggesting the positive influence of telecollaborative video-based practice on pragmalinguistic accuracy.

Concerning the immediate effects of practice contexts on fluency, Table 5 presents the speech rates of each group’s CRs on the pre-test and the immediate post-test. The results from an independent samples $t { \cdot }$ -test showed that the VT group’s speech rate $\mathit { ^ { \prime } M } \mathit { = } 4 . 0 6$ , $S D = . 4 7 )$ ) was significantly higher than the FTF group’s speech rate ( $\cdot M { = } 2 . 7 8$ , $S D = \mathcal { A } 2 \rangle$ on the immediate post-test, $t ( 6 3 ) = 1 1 . 5 3 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $d { = } 2 . 8 6 2$ , indicating the facilitative impact of telecollaborative video-based practice on L2 fluency.

# 5.2.  Long-term effectiveness of practice contexts in L2 pragmatic development

First, in terms of the lasting effects of practice contexts on pragmalinguistic accuracy, Table 6 displays the descriptive statistics of each group’s scores on the three tests. Figure 2 illustrates the scores graphically. The results from a paired samples $t { \cdot }$ -test showed that the VT group’s score of pragmalinguistic accuracy on the delayed post-test $\mathit { N } = 6 0 . 2 8$ , $S D = 2 . 8 0 _ { . } ^ { \cdot }$ ) was significantly higher than their score of pragmalinguistic accuracy on the pre-test $M = 5 5 . 9 6$ , $S D = 4 . 3 8 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ , $t ( 3 2 ) = 5 . 1 7 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $d \ : = \ : . 9 0 1$ , indicating the durable effectiveness of the telecollaborative video-based practice in the VT group’s pragmalinguistic accuracy after five weeks. In contrast, the FTF group’s score of pragmalinguistic accuracy on the delayed post-test was significantly lower $\mathit { \Delta } M = 3 4 . 4 1$ , $S D { = } 9 . 9 1$ ) than their score of pragmalinguistic accuracy on the pre-test $M = 5 7 . 8 1$ , $S D = 3 . 5 9 _ { , }$ ), $t ( 3 1 ) = 1 1 . 5 5 0$ , $p \ : < \ : . 0 0 1$ , $d { = } 2 . 0 4 2$ . Additionally, the results from an independent samples $t$ -test demonstrated that the VT group’s score of pragmalinguistic accuracy $\mathit { \Delta } M = 6 0 . 2 8$ , $S D = 2 . 8 0 $ ) was noticeably higher than the FTF group’s score of pragmalinguistic accuracy $( M = 3 4 . 4 1$ , $S D = 9 . 9 1$ ) on the delayed post-test, $t ( 6 3 ) = 1 4 . 4 2 0$ , $p \textless . 0 0 1$ , $d = 3 . 5 7 8$ .

Second, with respect to the durable effects of practice contexts on fluency, Table 7 shows each group’s speech rates on the three tests. Figure 3 illustrates the speech rates graphically. The results from a paired samples $t { \cdot }$ -test showed that the VT group’s speech rate increased significantly from the delayed post-test $\mathit { M } = 4 . 0 7$ , $S D ~ = ~ . 6 9 )$ to the pre-test ( $M = 2 . 7 1$ , $S D = . 2 9 )$ , $t ( 3 2 ) ~ = ~ 9 . 6 9 5$ , $p ~ < ~ . 0 0 1$ , $d { = } 1 . 6 8 8$ , indicating the lasting effectiveness of the telecollaborative video-based practice in the VT group’s fluency after five weeks. However, there was no significant difference between the FTF group’s fluency on the delayed post-test $\mathbf { \zeta } M = 2 . 7 3$ , $S D = \ldots 5 0 )$ and their fluency on the pre-test $\cdot M { = } 2 . 7 3$ , $S D =$ .38), $t ( 3 1 ) = . 0 0 6$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } }  { 9 9 5 }$ , $d = . 0 0 1$ . Furthermore, the results from an independent samples $t$ -test showed that the VT group’s speech rate $\mathit { M } = 4 . 0 7$ , $S D = . 6 9 )$ was noticeably higher than the FTF group’s speech rate $\cdot M { = } 2 . 7 3$ , $S D = . 5 0 _ { , } ^ { \cdot }$ ) on the delayed post-test, $t ( 6 3 ) ~ = ~ 8 . 8 9 4$ , $\textit { p } <$ .001, $d { = } 2 . 2 0 7$ .

# 5.3.  The diversity of CR sub-strategies

On the pre-test, after saying ‘thank you’, the CR sub-strategy that both groups used the most was returning a compliment (see Table 8). However, on the two post-tests, the diversity of the two groups’ CR sub-strategies exhibited different patterns. Specifically, after saying ‘thank you’ to the compliments, the VT group adopted the sub-strategy of providing explanations the most on both the immediate and delayed post-tests. In contrast, the FTF group’s immediate post-test CRs lacked diversity; after saying ‘thank you’ to the praise, they tended to adopt the thanking strategy without deploying another sub-strategy under the acceptance category. More intriguingly, the FTF group’s delayed post-test CRs demonstrated their increasing implementation of the deflection and denial strategies.

Note. Each percentage represents the proportion of a specific CR sub-strategy (e.g. returning) compared to all the sub-strategies that each group used on each of the three tests.

# 6.  Discussion

This section discusses the findings in three aspects: (a) the immediate influence of the two practice contexts, (b) the long-term effectiveness, and (c) the diversity of CR sub-strategies.

# 6.1.  Immediate influence of practice contexts on L2 pragmatic competence

The results showed that the VT group who practiced in a telecollaborative video-based modality for three weeks outperformed the FTF group on the immediate post-test regarding pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency of their CRs. The VT group’s improvement in pragmalinguistic accuracy corroborates previous findings in the literature on L2 acquisition. Saito and Akiyama (2017) reported the positive effects of video-based telecollaboration on Japanese EFL learners’ grammatical accuracy. Moreover, the VT group’s gain in fluency is consistent with the finding of Hung and Higgins (2016), which demonstrated the facilitative impact of the fast-paced telecollaborative video-based modality on L2 fluency development.

One possible interpretation of the significant progress that the VT group made in pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency on the immediate post-test is related to the learners’ high quality of deliberate practice with active student engagement in the video-based practice. As Dörnyei (2019) pointed out, student engagement plays a fundamental role in the automatization of L2 skills. To further investigate the potential influence of student engagement on the quality of the practice, the researcher took a closer at the VT group’s and the FTF group’s observable behaviors during the practice sessions. Behavioral engagement (e.g. providing detailed responses, asking follow-up questions, nodding) is one of the core components of student engagement (Dörnyei, 2019; Skinner et  al., 2008). As an example, Excerpt 1 shows that Dylan (from the VT group) was actively engaged in the video-based practice by providing longer responses, asking more questions, nodding more, and smiling/laughing more (see Appendix C for transcription conventions). The VT group actively applied the declarative pragmatic knowledge to real-life communication and seemed to pay attention to how the L1 speakers of English responded to compliments during the high-level engagement with their interlocutors, which may contribute to their improved pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency on the immediate post-test.

Excerpt 1 AI: American interlocutor, D: Dylan (a pseudonym)   
1 AI: What's your favorite food?.   
2 D: I LOVE \$Thai food\$ My favorite dish is (.) \$Pad Thai\$ Here is a photo of me eating Pad   
3 D: Tai my FIRST time \$What about you\$?   
4 AI: I love: Mexican food. I usually order $>$ enchiladas, tacos, and fajitas<   
5 D: Wow! They sound delicious ((nod)). What kind of \$tacos\$ do you like?   
6 AI: I really like \$fish tacos\$.   
7 D: I like \$fish tacos\$, too (nod). I always put a LOT of lemon juice (.) on the fish   
8 AI: Nice! $>$ By the way $<$ I like your hat in the photo   
9 D: \$Thank you\$ My best friend gave it to me (.) a year ago

In contrast, the FTF group was not as engaged as the VT group in the practice treatment. Excerpt 2 shows that Ryan (from the FTF group) briefly answered the American interlocutor’s questions without providing relevant information, asking follow-up questions, or nodding. The FTF group’s less involvement may be attributed to the anxiety of having face-to-face practice during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. reflected by Ryan’s response in a soft voice ‘Let me think’, indicating the communicative pressure and his need for more time). The FTF group’s high anxiety level might ‘draw L2 learners away from language use and interaction’ (Gass et  al., 2020, p. 531) and may even cause them to stop engaging in communication (Freiermuth, 2001). This could negatively affect the quality of practice. Their practice with less engagement might account for their less pragmalinguistically accurate CRs and little improvement in fluency on the immediate post-test.

Excerpt 2 AI: American interlocutor, R: Ryan (a pseudonym)

1 AI: What's your favorite food?   
2 R: I like (.) hot pot   
3 AI: I like hot pot, too. How often do you eat hot pot?.   
4 R: Let me think <Maybe every week>   
5 AI: Nice! I used to have hot pot with my roommate EVERY MONTH   
6 R: Oh, cool   
7 AI: $>$ By the way< I like the sweater that you wore in the photo.   
8 R: Oh, thank you.

Theoretically, these findings corroborate the vital role of deliberate practice in the ACT-R (Anderson, 1993). The deliberate and consistent practice in an engaging environment with the American interlocutors entailing repetitive retrieval, implementation, and mappings of CR strategies to production was conducive to transforming the VT group’s declarative pragmatic knowledge into procedural and automatized knowledge (Li, 2019). Since the learners’ procedural knowledge encoded multiple steps involved in adopting the CR strategies into one unified integration for processing, the VT group’s pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency in the associative phase and the autonomous phase increased significantly compared to their pre-test CRs at the cognitive stage.

# 6.2.  Long-lasting effectiveness of practice contexts in L2 pragmatic development

The results showed the long-term effectiveness of the telecollaborative video-based practice in pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency over time.

It seemed that the telecollaborative video-based practice transformed the VT group’s initial representations of form-function-context mappings into long-term memory, which brought about proceduralization and automatization on the delayed post-test (Li, 2012). This finding supports the essential role of deliberate and consistent practice in the ACT-R (Anderson, 1993), which might contribute to the development of procedural and automatized knowledge and lead to the retention of the VT group’s improved pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency over time and ‘nearly error-free performance with complete spontaneity’ (Li, 2019, p. 117).

This finding might also be explained by the Depth of Processing Theory (Craik & Lockhart, 1972), which states that processing and analyzing information at a deep level can result in memorizing the information for a longer time. The VT group’s deep processing of CRs during the video-based practice due to deliberate practice with high-level student engagement might push them to process the form-function-context connections more profoundly, which is likely to bring about the retention of the enhanced pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency. In contrast, the FTF group’s less engagement in the practice may give rise to surface-level processing of CRs, which might explain their reduced pragmalinguistic accuracy and little progress in fluency on the delayed post-test. Importantly, these findings add to our understanding of the long-term efficacy of telecollaborative video-based practice in L2 pragmatic development (i.e. pragmalinguistic accuracy and fluency).

# 6.3.  The diversity of CR sub-strategies

On the pre-test, after saying ‘thank you’, the CR sub-strategy that both groups adopted the most was returning a compliment. This finding might be justified by Leech’s (1983) Modesty Maxim. The Chinese EFL learners adopted more self-praise avoidance strategies, such as returning a positive comment to show modesty (Chen, 1993).

However, on both the immediate and delayed post-tests, after saying ‘thank you’ to the compliments, the VT group adopted the sub-strategy of providing explanations the most. To further explore the potential influence of the American interlocutors’ CR strategies on the VT group’s pragmatic choices, the researcher examined the 33 American interlocutors’ CRs during the video-based practice sessions. After saying ‘thank you’, the sub-strategy that the American interlocutors used the most was also the explaining sub-strategy $( 6 5 . 5 9 \% )$ . This finding showed that deliberate, consistent, authentic, and real-life practice with the L1 speakers of English might exert a direct impact on the VT group’s growing implementation of the explaining sub-strategy. More interestingly, one EFL learner from the VT group adopted the sub-strategy of showing agreement the most on the post-tests. It turned out that her American interlocutors tended to agree with the EFL learner’s compliments during the telecollaboration. This finding provides more evidence for the influence of deliberate, systematic, and natural practice on L2 learners’ pragmatic performance.

In contrast, the FTF group tended to adopt the thanking strategy without deploying another sub-strategy under the acceptance category on the immediate post-test. One way to explain this finding is that the FTF group had less engagement in the practice tasks. Although the American interlocutors also adopted the explaining sub-strategy the most $( 6 7 . 9 2 \% )$ at the practice stage, it seems that the FTF group did not pay attention to how the American students responded to praise. The FTF group’s less engagement might ‘draw L2 learners away from language use and interaction’ (Gass et  al., 2020, p. 531). More interestingly, the FTF group’s delayed post-test CRs showed their increasing implementation of the deflection and denial strategies, which may be explained by the profound influence of humbleness deeply rooted in Chinese culture (Chen, 1993). To summarize, these findings revealed that the VT group outperformed the traditional FTF group in pragmalinguistic accuracy, fluency, and diversity of CR strategies. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the telecollaborative video-based practice was durable over time, indicating the advantage of a telecollaborative video-based context over a traditional face-to-face context. From a theoretical perspective, not only do these findings corroborate Anderson’s (1993) ACT-R, which states that deliberate and consistent practice is conducive to converting declarative pragmatic knowledge into procedural and automatized knowledge, but also the findings suggest that learner-internal factors (e.g. student engagement) might affect learners’ deep processing of information and the quality of pragmatics practice.

# 7.  Conclusions, future directions, and implications

The current study compared the influence of two practice contexts (i.e. practice in a telecollaborative video-based setting versus practice in a face-to-face setting) on Chinese EFL students’ pragmatic competence in CRs. The findings showed that the VT group outperformed the FTF group regarding pragmalinguistic accuracy, fluency, and diversity of CR strategies on the immediate and delayed post-tests. These findings further advance our understanding of the effects of different practice contexts and offer novel insights into the superiority of a telecollaborative video-based context over a traditional face-to-face context in relation to L2 learners’ pragmatic development, especially during and/or after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Theoretically, this study expands the theoretical landscape by implementing a less commonly adopted paradigm in the field of L2 pragmatics: Anderson’s (1993) ACT-R. This study corroborates the ACT-R; deliberate and consistent practice is instrumental in converting declarative pragmatic knowledge into procedural and automatized pragmatic knowledge. Crucially, the current study suggests that although practice plays a vital role in L2 acquisition, pure practice does not always promote L2 pragmatic competence. Whether learners can reap the benefits of L2 pragmatics practice depends on the quality of deliberate practice and the interplay between learner-external factors (e.g. practice contexts) and learner-internal variables (e.g. student engagement).

Even though the present study has paved the way for similar research projects, this study contains several limitations. For instance, all learners were Chinese EFL students. The first desideratum for future studies, thus, is to recruit participants from various L1 backgrounds to generalize the findings of this study. Second, regarding assessing L2 pragmatic performance, although the current study adopted MMDCTs instead of traditional DCTs to provide more contextualization for test takers, we need to be cognizant of the limitations of this type of data-elicitation methods (e.g. might not reflect real-life communication in English). Future research may use more authentic ways to evaluate L2 learners’ pragmatic performance (e.g. through naturally occurring conversations). Additionally, more studies are expected to explore other under-researched pragmatic features (e.g. implicatures). Future studies may further investigate the effects of learner-internal factors (e.g. student engagement) on L2 pragmatic performance in different practice contexts.

The implications of this study are germane to teachers and students who are not immersed in a naturalistic L2 environment or have to adopt online/hybrid learning due to special circumstances (e.g. the pandemic). This study suggests that EFL teachers make use of technology and incorporate deliberate, consistent, authentic, and engaging telecollaborative activities and create opportunities for learners to practice what they have learned (i.e. declarative knowledge) instead of heavily adopting teacher-centered instruction, which is prevalent in EFL classrooms (Wang, 2016). EFL instructors or their institutions may collaborate with schools abroad and launch partnership programs to provide platforms for EFL students to interact with L1 speakers of English via telecollaborative tools (e.g. Zoom) (Zhang, 2022). For instance, EFL teachers may ask L1 speakers of English to create an account on WeChat. Then, each EFL student is paired up with one L1 speaker, and they conduct weekly conversations in English via WeChat. Thus, students can have more opportunities to apply the learned declarative pragmatic knowledge to real-life communication regardless of the pandemic or geographic boundaries.
