Educational reforms often entail and afford teachers' identity change. Adopting a community of practice (CoP) framework to examine reform-inflicted teacher identity change and drawing on data from eight rounds of semi-structured interviews over three and a half years, our longitudinal case study traced how three English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teachers negotiate their teacher researcher identity during an educational reform in China. We find that a multi-layered, multicentered, and multi-functional reform CoP of complex power dynamics can facilitate EAP teachers' negotiation of teacher-to-teacher researcher identity change during a curriculum reform, which can further enrich the long-term sustainable development of a community. Highlighting the significant role of CoPs in educational reforms and teacher development, we advocate a CoP of dynamic power relations and multiple power positions and call for frontline teachers' engagement with teaching-based research to potentially strengthen the research-practice nexus. This study bears implications for educational reform participants and teacher educators.

# 1. Introduction

There have been global fforts to promote  nation's active role in the rapidly expanding knowledge economy, which has reshaped the English education landscape worldwide. China, for example, has advocated several major curriculum reforms at all educational levels. In its 2022 edition, the English Currculum Standards for compulsory education particularly highlights the significance of cultivating Chinese adolescents' core competencies" (ie, language ability, cultural awareness, thinking capacity, and learning ability) through English education. As for collge level, the "Double First-Class" initiatie (2017), with an aim to build world-top universties and disciplines and to cultivate scientific and technological talents who are globally competent (Peters & Besley, 2018), also foregrounds the necessty to transform the college English education paradigm in China. As one of the mainstream reform directions, the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) practice has been considered as \*the key path" (Ta0 & Gao, 2018, p. 3 to prepare Chinese students with effective intenational communicatie competence and as a springboard for English teachers to reconstruct ther teacher identit from teaching language only to cultivating science talents through teaching English. Both policy initiaties regard English education as a means to promote students' thinking and learning abilities instead of teaching a series of inguistic symbols, Which poses great challenges to English educators in China. Furthermore, the "New Liberal Arts" initiative implemented in 2021 emphasizes on cultivating students interdiscilinary awareness and inovative ability (Zhang & Chen, 2022) and calls fr frontline teachers' eforts in constructing new humanities knowledge system from an interdisciplinary perspective, which requires English teachers elevated competencies in academic research besides teaching. However, given the ongoing tensions between teacher and researcher identities (Groothuijsen et a., 2019) that charactrize thefed of language education, how AP tachers who had struggled to reshape their teacher identity further construct their teacher researcher identity merits investigation. Drawing on a community of practice (CoP) perspective, this study, therefore, seks to explore how EAP teachers develop their teacher researcher identity as they engage in an EAP reform community that attempts to advance the reform on the one hand, and to generate new EAP-related knowledge and promote EAP teacher development, on the other. Our study willbear implications for educational reformers, teacher educators, and language teachers.

# 1.1. Holistic development in becoming teacher researchers

The widening gap between language teachers and language teaching researchers has been well documented (e.g., Groothuijsen et al., 2019). In addition to the often-perceived irrelevance (McKinley, 2019) of research findings to language teachers, lack of resources and instutional support also exacerbate the researcher-practioner divide. Overloaded by teaching assgnments, language teachers worldwide often find themselves disadvantaged at the quickly shifing academic culture (Dugas e al., 2018) toward research productivity. As members of an "academically marginalized community" (Liu & Borg, 2014, p. 288) that has rather weak research tradition, Chinese English teachers gneral lack of academic training and hence robust abilit to engage in active reearch has caught them in the bottleneck" (Wang & Han, 2011, p. 44)for further professional development. Moreover, as potentilly conflicting roles Dugas et l., 2018; Goijst al., 2019; ao, 2017) that fs n diffen activities, tehr ad echr idties compete for time and resource, making it dfficult for one to serve wel in both. English teachers who intend to break the teacher-researcher boundary often find themselves in identity dilemma (Barkhuizen, 2020), "pushed" (Nelson, 2017, p. 237) and "pulled' (Dugas et al., 2018, p. 1) in different directions.

To bridge the research-practice divide, recent collctive eforts have been made to promote practice-based research (Groothuijsen et al., 2019; Sato & Loewen, 2022) by involving both language teachers and researchers in developing English textboos (Shu e l. 2023), conducting collaboratie action rearch (De Costat al, 2022), or forming communties of practice (Becker, 2023; Irgens t al., 2023). However, given the increasingly publish-or-perish educational reality and the neoliberal evaluation of universty teachers that places dual emphasis on teachers' teaching and research productivity, it i important for language teachers to become holistic professionals (McKinley, 2019) who are both teaching- and research-competent. Teachers becoming teacher researchers wil not only enhance the reciprocal relationship between teaching and research (Taylor, 2017), but eventually gain English teachers recognition and improve their wellbeing (Shirley et al., 2020). The advantage is particularly prominent in an educational reform context where new teaching practices emerge so that new conceptualizations and knowledge are likely to thrive. As reform implementers who take an insider view (Groothuijsen et a., 2019), EAP teachers are likely to see possbilities for practice-based research since EAP, though unquestionably a research highlight at present, is stil an \*under-theorized" (Fox, 2009, p. 27) and inadequately studied area.

Nevertheless in the cimate of EAP reform, there has been a misalignment between Englishteachers' general limited research experience and ther pdaggical ais to facilitate students aadmic and rearch abilites (ui et al., 2023), which has crtd much space for EAP teacher development. In response to McKinley's (2019) cal for more holistic TEs0L professonals, it is necessary to explore pathways for EAP teachers to achieve such holistic development of becoming teacher researchers, which is largely under-researched in the existing literature. In particular, ittl isknown about how such dual identities are negotiated for English teachers in an ongoing EAP reform, in need of longitudinal investigations totrack their \*lengthy" (Taylor, 2017, p. 18) developmental process.

# 1.2. Complex power dynamics in reform community of practice

Community of practice (CoP) in educational reforms has gained considerable ground due to its importance in teacher identity construction. Chinese English teachers in an EAP reform usually engage themselves in collective laning (Gao et al., 2022) toperform reform-required tasks and to achieve professional development. By creating a social fabric of learning (Wenger et al., 2002, p. 28), frontline teachers with shared reform goals would have the opportunity to gain accessto reform-related new information to \*think together (Irgs t al., 2023, p. 2) and negotiate different understandings of the same reform reality, which may ultimately inform the reform practices and the construction of teacher identity. Wenger (1998) claimed that i is the interest in collective learning of new knowledge rather than the assigned tas that keeps a CoP sustainable. However, it is diffcult to sustain the active, interactive dynamics in a CoP, especially in an educational rform where knowledge learning is immediately driven by reform tass and classroom teaching. What empowers CoP to nurture long-term holistic professional development from language teacher to teacher researcher remains unknown.

Despite its co-constructive (Taylor, 2017) role in teacher identity transformation, particularly in a reform context, CoP has traditionally been characterized by asimplified understanding of power relations in its member teachers' negotiation of membership within one community or of multimembership experince in brokering (Cobb et al., 2018) acros ifferent communities. Wenger (1998) proposed the core-peripheral power relation, by describing legitimate peripheral participation as the proces for newcomers to gradually move inbound toward fuller participation ina community by interacting with experienced old-timers (Lave & Wenger, 1991) who facilitate their transition to become core members. Noteworthily, such single-centered and unidirectional conceptualizations of CoP have understated the possbilit of the inherent tensions in the \*inequalities of power (Shi & Yang, 2014, p. 134) within a CoP, considering the actual workplace reality where core members could manipulate participants' aces o crucial community resources in a way either to promote or prevent their egitimate peripheral participation (Morita, 2004); peripheral members, on the other hand, might struggle with or against the core power (Gao et al., 2022) or other members t realize thir active participation and professional development. The theoretical effort to divide CoP into tightly coupled ones where strong central power is performed and loosely coupled ones where weak control is exerted (Vahasantanen et al., 2008) could as well trivialize the complexity of power relations within a CoP since such distinction till implies the undirectional power practice towards a pre-set, single-centered relation, failing to see power as context-dependent (Foucault, 1980), socio-culturally created (Pitsow & Letseka, 2013), constantly repositioned (Chamberlain et al, 2020), and hence "deeply intertwined with the fluidity (Ruohotie-Lyhty et al, 2021, p. 2) of particular contexts. For instance, in high power distance societies (Hofstede, 2010), a tightly coupled CoP that allows it community members lessautonomy in decision-making may facilitat effective implementation of a top-down educational reform and benefit teacher identity construction, but may cause resistance and conflicts (Ruohotie-Lyhty et al, 2021) in a researcher community where free and open voices are vitally important for knowledge generation. In particular, the core member's central power position might be challenged and consequently disslved when the CoP itself changes from teaching-oriented to teaching-research-integrated, because such evolvement often involves changes in \*the social structure of communities and the power relations within them [that] define the learning possbilities available to members" (Mitchel & Myles, 2004, p. 241), making it necessary to examine the complex power dynamics in a reform community of long-term sustainability.

Given the inherent tensions (Ruohotie-Lyhty et al., 2021) in teacher-researcher relation, teacher-to-teacher researcher identity change involves negotiations of complex power dynamics. Many English teachers in China as both experienced classoom practitioners and novice researchers may experience uch \*shift of power Mitchll, 2015, p. 89) in their workplace because their power as teachers does not necessarily make them powerful researchers. Given the distinction between legitimate power (i.e., based on teachers assigned positions) and expert power (i.e., based on teachers' competence and subject-matter knowledge, Schrodt et al., 2007), formally-assgned leadership roles might easily win support within a group, but informal power based on a member's competence could also influence others. How English teachers negotiate teacher-researcher power relations within themselves and with their peers in a reform community of complex power dynamics merits research attention. This study, therefore, aims to address the following research questions.

1. What power relations facilitate teacher-to-teacher researcher identity change in an EAP reform CoP   
2. How do power dynamics change to sustain the development of an EAP reform CoP?

# 2. Methodology

A case study methodology as an "accessible, concrete, immediate, and personal (Duff, 2012, p. 96) approach was adopted in the present study to track and unpack the complex power dynamics within a reform CoP by providing \*thick description of 3 focal teacher participants' \*experiences, ssues, insights, developmental pathways" (Duff 2014, p. 1) in an EAP reform context over an extended period of time (van Lier, 2005).

# 2.1. The EAP reform and reform CoP

Our study was situated in a research-oriented university in Beijing, China, which emphasizes the integration of research and teaching and the training of future scientists. To better prepare science students for their future international communication, the universty strongly encouraged its English teachers to fer EAP courses to students from undergraduate to graduate levels. In Spring 2017 when the university-wide EAP reform started, a cohort of 13teachers with varied educational backgrounds (MA, PhD, and PhD candidate), prossinal ranks ctrer, ssciat rosr, nd fll pfessor), rch inrest (pd ingstcs, liure, nd translation & interpretation), gender, and years of teaching (1-24 years) was invited to a longitudinal research project that aims at probing into the best practices for continual teacher development in an educational reform through multiple rounds of one-on-one interviews. As part of the larger project, the present study chose Ling, Ming, and Ning (see Table 1 for their demographic information) as focal participants.

In Spring 2017 when the graduate-level EAP teaching reform started in her department, Ling was assigned to lead a group of fourteen English teachers who were al in complete lack of EAP teaching experience, herelf included, to compile an EAP textboo for a graduate-level EAP reading and writing course that was to open in Fall 2018. The textbook compilation marked the beginning of the EAP reform, which has undergone several key milestones afterwards (Fig 1) including making MOOCs based on the EAP textbook and developing EAP test bank, under the lead of Ling. Ming joined the textbook team from the beginning and was appointed as Ling's assistant since 2018 when Ling was assigned to lead a group of eight teachers to teach an EAP reading and writing course specifically for low-proficient graduate students. Ning joined the department in 2018 and was invited by Ling to her teaching cohort. Both Ming and Ning were involved in the teaching-related projects led by Ling (Fig. 1).

Our study focused on Ling, Ming, and Ning for several reasons. First, they voluntarily formed a smallscale reform CoP out of the eight-teacher EAP teaching cohort. Their genuine enthusiasm and mutuallyactive interactions about EAP teaching not only naturally united them into reform CoP in Fall 2018 but also have kept the CoP intact ever since. Second, this CoP is among the few EAP teaching programs that engage themselves in long-term active interactions after their construction of EAP teacher identit, and more importantly, it took the first move from Fall 2019to seek teacher-to-teacher researcher identity transition by targeting reform-based pulications. Third, this CoP was asembled by Ling whose identity as a senor teaching faculty shaped her legitimately assgned leadershp position in an EAP reform typicall see in Chinese universtie but whose identit as novice researcher made it dfficult to empower the sustainable CoP development into academic engagement. Fourth, when the EAP reform started, Ling, Ming, and Ning basically had no EAP teaching and research experiences and hence no expert knowledge in EAP studies, which caused the inherently unbalanced and even conflictual power rlations among their identitie as general English teachers, EAP teachers, and EAP teacher researchers, making them representatives of English teachers in China who struggle to regain their power in an educational reform context. Furthermore, though largely involved in similar teaching activities, the thre teachers experienced varied individual developmental traectories in becoming EAP teacher researchers, which complicates the power dynamics within their CoP. As an experienced English teacher with a background in stylistics, Ling has been devoted to teaching for years without considering connecting teaching with her research expertise and had limited publications on sporadic topics that are not teaching-based. Her interest in EAP-related research largely arises from her leadership experience in the EAP reform where she started to perceive the emerging field as \*fullof research gaps" (Ling, June 2021) and wanted to make their collective efort visible. In particular, she found that cultivating students critical thinking ability is esential in EAP instruction, which formed the core of her later research inquiries. Ming and Ning, on the other hand, witha background in second language acquisition, had some classoom-based research experience before joining the CoP, but developed divergent research focuses revolving EAP teaching. As a member of the EAP test reform team of the department, Ming grew strong interest in EAP assessment and had co-published four articles (thre first-author pieces) with Ling and Ning on this topic. Compared with Ming who mainly collaborated within the CoP, Ning drew on her mult-disciplinary collaboration experience and have been engaged in actie collborations with colleagues, including the CoP, on various topics, with a primary focus on EAP teacher devel. opment. Interestingly, despite Ling, Ming, and Ning's divers research focuses, they have sought to converge their research expertise and are currently working on a paper on the effect of professional learning community on the development of EAP teachers language assesment literacy, a project led by Lig. t is dueto their distinct roles within the CoP, with Ling being the old-timer, Ming a member, and Ning a member and a broker, that makes the investigation of this CoP meaningful. Finall, they were all promoted to a higher rank during data collection partly because of their agentic involvement in EAP-related teaching and research practices.

# 2.2. Data collection and analysis

Interview data were cllected at the end of each semester over three and a half years (Table 2),consisting of eight interviews for each participant. The semi-structured interviews conducted in Chinese mainly enquired about participants current impresions on the CoP, their current CoP activities, their understandings about their own and others' roles in the communit, improvements made and difficulties encountered at the present stage, and their perceived future of the CoP.

Given the changing context of each interview, questions varied according to the current situation at the time of the interview and interviewees' respective responses. Great care was taken to ensure interviewees freedom to express their thoughts without being interrupted. Each interview, ranging from 26 to $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , was audio-recorded and transcribed by an IFLyTEK intelligent recording pen, and checked word for word manually by Author 1 before compiled into 97,236 Chinese characters. The 24 transcriptions were read independently multiple times before they were separately analyzed (see Table 3, Gao & Cui, 2023) by authors. Disagreements were solved through discussions. The selected excerpts were then translated into English by Author 1 and proofread by Author 2.

# 2.3.  Research positionality

The researchers in this study took an insider-and-outsider perspective. Author 1's insider position was grounded upon her own EAP teacher identity formation and her EAP teacher-to-teacher researcher transformation in the ongoing EAP reform, granting her deep resonance with the participants identity struggles. Author 1's outsider perspective was roted in her identity as the dean of the department who has steered the EAP reform involving several CoPs. Author 1 used her external power to appoint Ling the leadership role in a series of EAP reform tasks (e.g., textbook compiling, course developing), and also to provide such valuable resources as multi university collboration, which was later proved an important opportunity to initiat their teacher-teacher researcher transition. Author 1's outsider power position may have certain influence on the interviews, but her insider stance helped build a close rapport with frontline teachers who were rather candid in expressing their views during the interviews. In addition, her insider and outsider perspectives were well balanced when interviews from different CoP members were carefully crosschecked. Author 2, Ning in the present study, was an obvious insider, which, however, did not make herself istinctive from the other two participants as to disturb the consistency and objectivity of the data due to several reasons. First, though Author 2 was the first to reveal to Author 1 unwittingly in the June-2019 interview that their CoP was making it teacher-teacher researcher move, her words were soon echoed by Ling and Ming, with the three equall informed of Author 1's interest in their ongoing dentity change from teacher to teacher researcher in the reform context. Second, though Author 2 was the first to be aked for her opinions about the research possbilitie for tacher-teacher researcher transition, the th participants were al inquired about their consent for Author to trace their tachr rercher idntity transforming process. The decision to include Ning as a co-author was not made until July 2023 during data analysis which was based partly on their previous collaborative publication experiences and partl on the need for an alternative perspective on data analysis that would add insights and trustworthiness to the interpretations of data. Third, though Author 2 was fully aware of Author 1's research intention on teacher-to-teacher researcher identity change, the three participants were on the same page about Author 1's research focus on power dynamics, ecause this specific topic did not emerge until recently when Author 1 closely examined the data and became aware that teacher identity change is not extricable from the complex power dynamics in an educational reform. Author $_ { 2 3 }$ outsider view arose from her active academic collaborations with several other colleagues, including Author 1, outside the CoP, adding to the changing power dynamics of the CoP.

# 3. Findings

# 3.1. Multi-layered power relations within the CoP

In Ling, Ming, and Ning's reform CoP, there are three highly interactive layers of power relations-EAP teachers, EAP teacher researchers, and personal connections--resulting in complex power dynamics within the community.

The first layer of power relations has been built on the CoP's EAP teaching practice, in which Ling'score-member rle with the oldtimer experience in teaching is wel received by Ming, Ling's assistant who has been \*immensely devoted" (Ling, December 2021) to aiding Ling through the whole reform proes, and Ning, who firs felt"somewhat at a los (Ning, June 2020) in the new working environment and the demanding reform context but later benefited considerably from Ling's strong guidance and scafolding as the team leader.

Excerpt 1 (Ming, December 2022):

Ling has led us through so many important reform tasks. We opened our EAP reading and writing course, made the first EAP MOOC in our university, co-developed our EAP test bank and, as far as I know, used it for the first large-scale EAP online test in our country. It is undeniable that I do occasionally feel a sense of achievement.

Excerpt 2 (Ning, June 2020):

Ling is really supportive of new teachers, sharing many useful courseware and teaching materials with us. It not only saved me much time and energy in preparing new lessons, but also led me into the field of EAP teaching, a whole new world for me... I think my teaching life might turn out to be something different without Ling

It is clear that the first layer where Ling, Ming, and Ning mostly identify themselves as EAP teachers mainly features Ling's central power position in the CoP. Despite their \*strong motive to grow quickly" (Ming, December 2019) into \*research active" (Ning, December 2019) EAP teachers, their teacher-to-teacher researcher development was at first much hindered by their tight teaching schedules and, in particular, their \*lack of clear research focus' (Ling, December 2019) due to their various research interests.

The turning point for their identity transition into a teacher researcher was their participation in a multi-universty action research project in which Enlish teacher communities from several Chinee universties shared their action research projects and reported their research progress every week in 2020. Through formulating reearch questions, identifying theoretical frameworks, analyzing data, and writing paper draft, the thre teachers managed to come to one focused reearch ideacultivating EAP learners critical thinking ability through technology-facilitated training, a topic that was initially proposed by Ling and was incorporated as a main teaching objective in their curculum design. This joint action research led by Ming was critical for the CoP's teacher-to-teacher researcher transformation because it not only drew their random research attention to a focused target but also created another layer of power relations that involved reearch. In this layer of reearch-oriented relations, each CoP member i appreciated to ctively exchange their academic thinking, and to converge such "golden thinking" (Ling, June 2021) into valuable research findings.

Excerpt 3 (Ling, June 2023):

The action research gave me an important opportunity to showcase our EAP teaching achievements. These innovative points deserved sharing with colleagues by having them published. We had quite intensive discussions that year, because Ming needed to make regular reports on our research progress. The project was definitely a thrust to push our teaching and research together.

When moving toward the second layer, the CoP members perceive a dynamic and fluid power relations within the community. For instance, when leading the action research, Ming started taking responsibilities to assign tasks to the other two members who also recognized and lent ful support t his leader role. In an evolving CoP from teaching-focused to reearch-oriented, the power relations are largely co-constructed and negotiated because without old-timer experiences, each community member is encouraged to exploit their respective advantages to generate new knowledge, which affords the CoP's sustainable development.

The third layer of power relations arises from their close personal connections. There seems an \*unbreakable bond (Ling, December 2022) between the three teachers who have gained mutual trust, developed emotional empathy, and forged "astrong tie" (Ming, December 2021) in work and life. They found their different personalities "very pleasant" (Ming, June 2021), all highly "responsive" (Ning, December 2022), \*reciprocal and supportive" (Ming, December 2019) to each other, making thir active CoP a "safe base" (Ning, December 2020) where they could lean their hearts on' (Ling, June 2021).

Excerpt 4 (Ling, June 2022):

Our small group has great psychological significance in maintaining our mental health. .. For young teachers like Ming and Ning who are under enormous peer pressure in their professional development, our group could be the haven that shelters them from stress. Our aimless small talks create a completely pressure-free space, rarely seen in a working environment of various power relations.

In such a CoP deeply cherished as a \*precious treasure" (Ning, December 2022 that could be owned only out of "good luck" (Ling, June 2020), the thre teachers share completely equal powers" (Ling, June 2023) in the layer of ersonal connections, alowing them to have free interactions in the layers of teachers (i.e., the first layer) and researchers (i.e., the second layer).

Excerpt 5 (Ning, December 2022):

We are very responsive and interactive to each other as if we are 24-hour online. .. Also, I am not under any power pressure to comment on an idea. For example, when I believe that a test item designed by Ling or Ming for the EAP test bank could be improved, I would openly point that out without being worried that they would be unhappy.

Although the three layrs demonstrate different power relations, they mutually contribute to each ther, creting arelatively stable but flexible power dynamics. The layer of reform-required EAP teaching practices constitutes the basis for Ling, Ming, and Ning's teacher-to-teacher researcher identity change and the development of their close personal connections. The emerging layer of their teacher researcher role improves and inspires their day-by-day teaching practices and binds them even closer to form an inseparable team ready to take on more challenges. The layer of personal connections has been affording their mutual trust and self-confidence in their collaborative construction of EAP teacher and teacher researcher identities. Born out of the layer of EAP teachers with rather fixed centripetal power relations and the layer of personal connections with equal powers, the teacher researcher layer with dynamically changing power relations adds new vitality to the development of the reform CoP. By allowing each member for autonomous exercise of leading power in CoP research actvties, resource from all thre layers of their identities are open for any possible integrations to sustain the community's continuing development and strengthen individual members' teacher researcher identity.

# 3.2. Negotiating multiple power centers in becoming teacher researchers

Although the construction of teacher researcher identity involves dynamic changes in the community power relations, what sus. tains and moves forward the CoP's research activities is the negotiation of multiple power centers among the community members

Because Ling, Ming, and Ning's research collaboration is completely based on their EAP teaching practices, Ling's leading power in the layer of EAP teachers has been implicitly projected onto the layer of teacher researchers, which has brought an indispensably positive impact on the CoP's research activities. First, Ling's leading experience helped regulate the \*usually unorganized' (Ning, December 2020) research schedule into \*well planned" (Ming, December 2020) and feasible steps to \*achieve the research goals" (Ning, June 2021). Second, Ling's leadership identity to coordinate the MA-level EAP teaching program grants her valuable authority to influence students, which is vitally important for conducting teaching-based research.

Excerpt 6 (Ning, June 2022):

I think Ling played an awesome role in different research project led by Ming and I. For example, I wanted tocollect some survey data from Mo0c students, but many students just ignored the questionnaire because it is optional. Ling was a great helping hand by sending out a class notice to all the Mooc students, urging them to complete the questionnaire as soon as possible.

Though highly recognized, as an experienced teacher but novice researcher, Ling often found herself disadvantaged at leading the CoP toward aresearch-oriented one and was sometimes \*afraid of pulling young people down Ling, December 2020). Alternatively, compromising the center position within the teacher researcher layer of CoP, Ling acknowledged the benefits of having one member exercising his/her leading power over one research project to fulfill the CoP's collective research goals.

Excerpt 7 (Ling, December 2021):

Its very important to have one leader for each research project. .. The leader should come up with the entire research plan and make clear work divisions for everyone. I hope that one of us could take the lead and the rest of us would follow to fulill our research plans.

The multiple power centers worked quite wellfor the CoP's research output because they have collaboratively published four research articles, two in Chinese and two in English, and are currently preparing several other projects. Such active research engagement indicates their ongoing eforts in achieving their teacher researcher identity. However, the co-existence of two or three leading centers may give rise to some power conflicts. As typical language teachers, our participants were heavily burdened with teaching load, leaving them littl room for research that may be further split for multile research projects at the same time. The uneven amount of time and attention devoted to different reearch activitie, often conditioned by their personal leading style, was one of the reasons for power conflicts in the CoP.

Excerpt 8 (Ming, June 2021):

I received my doctoral training in a culture where people are ashamed of causing trouble to others. I sometimes can se that this culture may have influenced the way of leading my project. Itend to arange everything by myself without having thorough discussions with others. This may make me look like a very controlling person..

Interestingly, Ming's leading style forms a sharp contrast to that of Ning who received her graduate training in a culture that embraces more open discussions among collaborators. However, such power conflicts only appeared in the researcher layer, an indicator f the gt dfict inher constuction f tch rrch intit. hees, th wer cnits sto be mediated by the first (ie., EAP teachers) and third (i.e, personal connections) layers of the power dynamics; that i, depite the dificulties in maintaining each member's power center in negotiating their teacher researcher role, they managed to have the implicit conflicts largely reconciled through their constant interactions about EAP teaching and their daily life. The shared teaching intrest and mutual trust mitigated much of the power conflicts in leading research projects and reshaped the power dynamics in which they became \*very used to leading [their] own projects while working with others" (Ling, June 2023). Notably, as they are acquring more solid teacher researcher identity, they became more competent leaders in their own project, thus experiencing less power conflicts within the community. It should also be noted that unlike the first layer of EAP teachers and third layer of personal connections that have rather closed boundaries to hold Ling, Ming, and Ning together, the multiple power centers in the second layer of teacher researchers allow them more agency and autonomy for collaborative research activities beyond their CoP. Meanwhile, even with the open boundary in the second layer, they are least worried about the disintegration of their "multifunctional (Ming, December 2022) community and the discontinuity in their research collaborations which they believe can \*re-activate at alltimes" (Ling, June 2022).

Strikingly, their power positions in the layers of EAP teachers and teacher reearchers correspond with their dfferent views on what means to be a teacher researcher. To Ling who takes her central power position mainly in the layer of EAP teachers, their active research engagement can make them better teachers" (Ling, June 2023) since research should benefit teaching (Ling, December 2022); to Ming who considers himself stil in short of trngth (Ming, December 2022) to lead a research project with ease, their CoP is $\% 0 \%$ for building EAP teacher identity and $4 0 \%$ for teacher researchers" (Ming, June 2023); and to Ning who not only participates in the CoPs rearch projets but also broker crossdiffeent comntie for aadeic collaboratios, their o that ws itilly for teaching purposes \*is now defintely a place more for teaching-based research than for pure teaching" (Ning, June 2023). Clearl, to Ling, Ming, and Ning, their power positions in the layer of EAP teachers and teacher researchers conform with their diffrent teacher. to-teacher researcher transformation trajectories. The greater control they have in a particular power relation, the more likely they would value their role in that relation.

# 4. Discussions

By tracing the identit transformation of three EAP teachers in a CoP, the resent study shows how a multi-laered, multi-entered and multi-functional CoP with complex power dynamics mediates their ongoing negotiation of teacher-to-teacher researcher identity change during an EAP reform. The three teachers developed a collective and collborative culture to navigate the EAP-related knowledge by enhancing their ability and credibility as EAP teachers and by mutually exercising their power to become teacher researchers.

In line with previous research that regards teacher identity as socially constructed and contextually situated (e.g., Gao & Cui. 2021), this study shows that in a challenging educational change, English teachers in China make agentic use of social resources in the complex power dynamics of their CoP to achieve their sustained identity development from EAP teachers to teacher researchers. However, our study counters the previous findings that tended to treat teacher and reearcher as conflicting roles (Dugas et a., 2018; Groothuijsen et al., 2019; Taylor, 2017) by viewing an educational reform as a continuing holistic developmental path for frontline teachers who may take their pace to engage in different phases of identity formation. Our study also clarifies the idealist view $\mathrm { ( X u , }$ 2017) that good teachers can simultaneously be good researchers by explicating that English teachers' previously formed EAP teacher identity can contribute to their later emerged role as teacher researchers without necessarily causing identity dilemma (Barkhuizen, 2020) or serious power conflict (Ruohotie-Lyhty et al., 2021). More importantly, frontline teachers in our study resorted to flexible use of available affordance i their identity construction of teacher researchers. When buildig their AP teacher identity, Ling, Ming, and Ning mainly looked for centripetal interactions without seeking opportunities for extensive collborations outside their CoP, reinforcing the legitimate center represented by Ling, the experienced old-timer inthe layer of EAP teachers. However, when building their teacher researcher identit, somewhat harder to achieve, the three teachers were open for possible within-group and cross-boundary collaborations to enhance their research competence and expert power as leading centers in the layer of teacher researchers. Therefore, power dynamics in a reform CoP may shft (Mitchell, 2015) in accordance with the construction of teacher and teacher researcher identities to support a smooth though often slow identity transition and to sustain CoP development.

Echoing with previous research that professional CoP holds considerable promise for frontline teachers' capacity building in difficult reform contexts (Gao et al., 202), our study proves that a reform CoP nurtures not only English teachers ability to acquire and apply pre-given knowledge (Morita, 2004), but also their creativity to generate new reform-related knowledge (Smith, 2022). In particular, a reform CoP could be a\*privileged locus" (Wenger, 1998 p.21) for the production of practical knowledge co-constructed through teaching and in turn feeding back to teaching. Our study adds to the current CoP conceptualizations in three aspects. First, different from other findings that depict CoP as having one core position and CoP members as interacting inbound to work their way to full participants f their community (Lave & Wenger, 1991), our study reveals that CoP could be a far more complex concept in which multiple central positions can co-exist. CoP members may not only negotiate pre-existing meanings (Wenger, 1998) constituted in the community core as the only central power in CoP but also co-create new meanings in the complex power dynamics of mutually supportive power centers in their identity formation. Second, extending previous research that unfolds CoP participants multi-membership experience in brokering acros ifferent communities (Cobb et a., 2018), our study species that CoP boundaries could be both open and closed at the same time because some power relations in CoP allow its members outbound trajectory whereas others tend to constrain them within the community. Such seeming paradox indeed sustains CoP development because constant cross-community interactions, though can enhance individual members' competence, may weaken within-community engagement and hence undermine the CoP sustainability, thus in need of a balanced intactness that could hold members tight to foster their stronger sense of identity with than without their CoP. Third, unlike the current conceptualization that treats CoP as either tightl or loosely coupled (Vahasantanen et al., 2008), our research presents the possbility that both weak and strong control over the com munity could be exercised at once due to the diffrent power relations at play in the community. Our study brings CoP back to its real root in the inricate workplacerelity, thus unveiling it as a far more complex construct with multiple interactive power centers than a "flat" (Gore, 1995, p. 168) social network with one controlling center. These findings may inform teacher educators and frontline teachers who seek to conduct teaching-based research in that a community with open possilitie for diffrent but reciprocal power relations is likely to scaffold teachers' becoming teacher researchers.

Our study regards power relations as a culturally- and contextually-conditioned social network (Chamberlain et l., 2020; Pitsow & Letseka, 2013) in that frontline teachers in China specify their power positions in a particular reform community and situate their identity transformation within it complex power dynamics. We further show that power \*only exists in action'" (Foucault, 1980, p. 89), considering that the three teachers i this study take agentic actions to gain their co-constructed power and to grow into teacher researchers. Our research moves forward the present power studies by exploring the possibility of a multi-layered, multi-centered, and multi-functional power dynamics that sustains CoP development and facilitates teacher researcher identity construction. Such power dynamics brings about fairly balanced (Chamberlain et al., 2020) \*power-with" rather than \*power-over' (Wong, 2016, p. 248) re lations in which CoP members maintai certain power hierarchy as well asupport each other's power position to co-construct their teacher researcher identity. We found that the multiple layrs of power relations could stem from one layer, either naturally s in Ling, Ming, and Ning's case, from the layer of EAP teachers to that of personal connections, or somehow accdently from the layer of EAP teachers o that of teacher reearchers which largely occrred owing to the critical eent of their action rearch project. Each layr of power relations may draw different amount f attention from English teachers who usually atach varying degrees of importance to their construction of diffrent identities. The multi-layered power relations allow the co-existence of multiple power centers that multilaterally interact with each other across different layers to produce complex power dynamics in a CoP.

The CoP members in our study took agentic actions to mutually support each other into solid power centers. Compared with the CoPs that have a large number of participants, the small group of Ling, Ming, and Ning is particularly capable of affrding substantial practical, intellectual, and emotional support, basically unfeasible in a community with only one or too many power centers. It seems that the CoP members in our study adapted their power practice to the changing educational context to sustain their ongoing identity development, which was made possble partly due to their strong will to become teacher researchers and partly due to their close personal connections that would counterbalance any type of power conflicts. By highlighting the productive property of power, our study finds that low power distance (Hofstede, 2020) and strong mutual support in a reform context can create an empowering workplace environment that encourages continuing professional development. Instead of presenting a competing discourse featuring one central power position (Ruohotie-Lyhty et al., 2021), our findings depict a decentralized power reality that generates multiple power centers in one layer of professional identity and at the same time keeps one central power position in another, showing a way for English teachers to explore practicable types of power relations to achieve their holistic professional development in a reform CoP.

# 5. Conclusion

This case study presented how three EAP teachers negotiated ateacher researcher identity through their engagement in a reform CoP that features multi-layered, multi-centered, and multi-functional power dynamics to sustain the CoP's long-term development In addition to the theoretical contributions to CoP and power research mentioned earlier, our findings may inspire reform leaders to encourage negotiable oPs as an effective tool to promote teachers identit development to advance the reform proces. The present study also bears significant implications for educational reformers who, on the one hand, should take a long-term perspective in facilitating frontline teachers sustainable development; and on the other, should be ready to adapt thir power practices to teachers emerging nees for new identity construction. Lastly, consistent with the recent call to strengthen the research-practice nexus in language teacher education (Sato & Loewen, 202) this study clearly shows how a reform CoP can create and sustain workplace cultures that promote the research-teacher dialogues and facilitate the development of teacher researchers.

Although findings of this case study may not be generalizable, especially considering our focus on one small CoP of thre members, we tried to delineate a full picture of how our participants trudge through their EAP journey by tracing their development over three and a half years and by crosschecking their interview excerpts within their own discourse and among CoP members. Such in-depth descriptions ensure the validity of our findings, and we anticipate it would align with the interest of educational reformers, teacher educators, and frontline teachers who concern teacher-to-teacher researcher development in demanding educational changes. At the same time, we call for more future studies focusing on language teachers with diverse backgrounds and situated within dfferent types of CoPs in critical educational changes.
