The effectiveness of group tasks in L2 classes relies in large part on individual students' Willingness to Communicate (WTC) during the duration of the task. Dornyei (2009) sug- € gested four conglomerates of task motivation from a dynamic systems perspective, but these conglomerates may not include all possible factors affecting task-situated WTC. Focus group based research was used to explore what English language learners at two universities in Macau, a Special Administrative Region of China, say motivates them to participate or not participate in group tasks. Interest, perceived effectiveness, good groupmates, good classroom social situation, personal vision and self-confidence were themes identified as both motivating and also, when in inverse form or absent in student experience, demotivating. Marks were also identified as a motivating influence. Overall, Macau students mentioned that social factors and task-related factors significantly influenced task-situated WTC in addition to self-confidence and L2 learning motivation, which are part of general L2 WTC models. In light of these findings, recommendations are made to adjust and add to Dornyei's (2009) conglomerates to create a model of task-situated€ WTC. Some suggestions for further research and implications for L2 teachers in arranging group tasks are given.

# 1. Introduction

Why do some language learners take advantage of group tasks while others participate minimally or not at all? While reasons related to L2 learning motivation (e.g. Hashimoto, 2002), culture (e.g. Jin & Cortazzi, 1998), personality (e.g. Macintyre, Dornyei, Cl € ement, - & Noels, 1998), and the particular situation and atmosphere in which the task is taking place (e.g. House, 2004 cited in Cao & Philp, 2006) have been suggested, they have not been incorporated into a model that researchers and practitioners alike can reference. The majority of research on L2 learning motivation, to this point, has concerned long-term motivation, though research into task-specific motivation has been identified as an area with great potential (Dornyei, 2002 € ). Looking at group tasks from another angle, researchers into willingness to communicate (WTC) at the situated and state-level (e.g. Cao & Philp, 2006; Macintyre et al., 1998; Yashima, Zenuk-Nishide, & Simizu, 2004) have concluded that “further research on situational WTC, particularly the antecedents of WTC” (Cao & Philp, 2006, p. 490), is necessary to understand the construct better and make appropriate recommendations for the classroom. For oral group tasks, the antecedents of WTC are, in essence, the same as task-specific motivations; thus, insights from both these avenues of research should be considered.

Tied to concerns about contextual influences on L2 use is the developing understanding of L2 motivation and WTC as dynamic constructs, changing on a moment by moment basis (Dornyei, 2014; MacIntyre, 2007; MacIntyre € & Legatto, 2011). Using a dynamic systems framework, Dornyei (2009a) € outlined four antecedents of task behavior which he termed motivational conglomerates. However, these conglomerates, namely interest, productive learner role, motivational flow and vision, were not organized into a model.

In order to consolidate previous findings on task motivation and WTC regarding group oral tasks, the study discussed in this article was undertaken in Macau, a Special Administrative Region of China. Study participants identified and explained their motivations for participating in pair and group tasks based on discussion of various task types. This approach was chosen in order to avoid biasing participants' discussion by suggesting previously identified influences (Melles, 2004). This article examines how closely the reasons mentioned by Chinese ethnicity university students in Macau for participating in group tasks in the EFL classroom correspond to Dornyei's (2009a) € motivational conglomerates. The article concludes with proposing a dynamic model of factors that affect L2 WTC in communicative tasks.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Situated willingness to communicate

WTC, the willingness to initiate communication, was originally conceived of in the L1 as a relatively static, personality based trait (McCrosky, 1992 cited in Hashimoto, 2002). MacIntyre et al. (1998) linked the concept to L2 usage, arguing that L2 WTC is affected by a large number of state and trait influences and motivators, many of which may not be relevant to L1 usage. Models of the relationship between WTC and L2 learning motivation show WTC as contributing directly to L2 communication frequency while L2 learning motivation is said to contribute to L2 communication frequency either directly, indirectly through WTC, or both (e.g. Hashimoto, 2002; Yashima, 2002; Yashima et al., 2004). L2 learning motivation likely affects WTC in group tasks (e.g. Dornyei, 2002 € ), but the effects may be less than in relation to general WTC.

Situated L2 WTC was defined by MacIntyre et al. (1998) as “a readiness to enter into discourse at a particular time with a specific person or persons using a L2” (P.547). MacIntyre et al. (1998) proposed a model of variables (see Fig. 1) in which situation-specific influences on WTC, such the state of self-confidence and the desire to communicate with the given interlocutor, are separated from more stable, enduring influences such as personality, and attitudes toward the L2 and L2 speakers. The latter are seen as affecting situated WTC indirectly through influencing more immediate variables. The model considers WTC in situations of all sorts including where communication may not be mandatory; thus it stops short of being a task-situated WTC model as it does not address how the requirements of the given situation/task in the classroom affect WTC.

Cao and Philp (2006) employed questionnaires, observations and interviews in a multi-national ESL class in New Zealand to determine what variables affect WTC in the classroom situation. They found that while self-reported trait WTC did not correlate with observed WTC in class, the number of people in the task group (pairs, small groups, whole class) affected WTC, a finding confirmed through interviews with participants (see also Leger & Storch, 2009). Other factors often identified as affecting WTC in these three contexts were self-confidence, familiarity with the interlocutor, and interlocutor participation. However, Cao and Philp's (2006) study focused on the experiences of only eight participants regarding tasks in a particular 4 week period. Thus other factors, that might affect WTC in group tasks under different circumstances, were not identified. Nonetheless, these findings add to the body of literature indicating that the immediate social context significantly impacts learners' WTC in a given task.

Fig. 1. Heuristic model of variables influencing WTC (Macintyre et al., 1998, p. 547).

Researchers have identified several additional factors that may affect situated WTC, including personality, previous experience, cultural background and social factors, such as group dynamics, status, and presence of the opposite sex (Cao & Philp, 2006; Chan, 1999; Dornyei, 2001b; Freiermuth € & Jarrell, 2006; Jin & Cortazzi, 1998). However, these findings have not yet been consolidated into a teacher and researcher friendly model.

# 2.2. Previous task motivation model

Freiermuth and Huang (2012) proposed a model of task motivation in which task attractiveness, task innovativeness, perceived need to learn the L2 and general WTC affect motivation to participate in a task (see Fig. 2). The authors found that all four factors were motivating for Taiwanese and Japanese university students in cross-national online chat discussions. Most of these ideas can be linked to Dornyei's (2009a)€ conglomerates; Task attractiveness and innovativeness are related to Interest (see Section 2.3.1) and Motivational flow (see Section 2.3.3) while perceived need relates to Vision (see Section 2.3.4). However, Freiermuth and Huang's (2012) model does not specifically address communicative tasks or the effect of the social milieu.

Moreover, the authors’ discussion of WTC and perceived need in this model are not of how these factors affected participation in the task but rather of how features of the task itself (in this case an online chat discussion) affected WTC and L2 learning motivation. This serves as a reminder that while models may appear static, portraying separate factors as affecting the result in a given way, in fact those factors themselves may also simultaneously be changing as they are affecting, and affected by, other factors; in short, a model of situated motivations must be one that is viewed as dynamic and changing throughout the task process (Dornyei, 2002 € ).

# 2.3. Conglomerates of task motivation

Dornyei (2009a) € defined motivational conglomerates as “optimal combinations of motivational, cognitive and emotional factors with regard to task behavior that operate as integrated units” (p. 2). These conglomerates are not basic building blocks of motivation, but rather dynamic aspects of the learner experience that interact in influencing a learner's engagement in any given task. Dornyei's (2009a) € conglomerates are outlined in Table 1 and discussed below.

Dornyei's (2009a) € descriptions are based primarily on research from Europe and North America. Comparing his descriptions to those of non-Western learners, who have been influenced by different educational systems and cultures, could help in fine-tuning the descriptions to develop a dynamic model of task motivation.

# 2.3.1. Interest

Research has shown that meaningful L2 tasks are both more interesting to learners and more productive for L2 development than are mechanical tasks, perhaps because they offer a conceptual, rather than simply language-based, challenge to learners (Ortega, 2007). Dornyei (2014) € explains that interest as a motivational conglomerate involves various motivating influences (attractiveness, positive emotional response, and curiosity toward a domain) that are understood to act as a whole (p. 84). Aside from topic, other aspects of a task can trigger interest, such as surprise or novelty (Renninger, 2009). Freiermuth and Huang (2012) elaborate that students’ interest is raised when a task is familiar but innovative in the classroom, such as when linking activities experienced outside the classroom with L2 tasks. Other aspects of tasks that make them attractive to learners are those that give learners some autonomy or teach them new ideas (Egbert, 2003; Freiermuth & Huang, 2012). Unfortunately, the more meaningful and interesting tasks are, the more learners tend to use the L1, which suggests that interest alone is not sufficient to motivate L2 production in tasks (Butler, 2011). Interest is likely as much a motivator for students in Macau as elsewhere.

# 2.3.2. Productive learner role

The second of Dornyei's (2009a)€ conglomerates is casting the learner in a productive role. Though Dornyei's (2009a)€ description does not clarify what elements might affect the productiveness of the partnering, social expectations, interpersonal relationships, and group dynamics are mentioned, that is, social elements. Dornyei (2001b) € expands on the understanding of groupmates' influence (see Section 2.1), explaining that task motivation appears to be developed jointly by the motivation of each group member, an idea termed motivational co-construction. In support of this idea, Dornyei (2002) € found that students with low task attitudes produced much more speech in pair tasks when their partners had high task attitudes. In addition to the influence by one's task partner(s), other classmates, the teacher, the classroom atmosphere, and parents and other figures outside the classroom may also affect task motivation (Dornyei, 2001b; Gorham € & Millette, 1997). The extent to which this is so in Macau is unknown.

# 2.3.3. Motivational flow

Of Dornyei's (2009a)€ conglomerates, ‘motivational flow’ differs from the other three in that it includes two-tiers of motivation, the top tier being the flow experience itself and the bottom tier being qualities of the task that may encourage a flow experience. Experience of flow, first suggested by Csikszentmihalyi (1975, cited in Egbert, 2003), can be described as the experience of being completely focused and involved in a task, which generally results in more successful performance. The experience of flow is a positive one that can motivate continued engagement in that task. However, its motivating role could just as likely be in influencing participation in future similar tasks (Egbert, 2003). Moreover, as there is little literature on the relationship between WTC and flow, the extent to which flow is experienced in L2 group tasks and the effect this might have on WTC are unclear.

In regards to factors contributing to a flow experience, the task itself is described as the main motivator. Egbert (2003) outlines four qualities of a task, as perceived by the learner, that promote a flow experience: 1) difficulty that matches the learner's ability 2) opportunity for focused attention 3) authentic or interesting content or format and 4) some control in the hands of the learner. However, appropriate task arrangement is not sufficient as motivational flow also depends on other conditions, such as mood, absence of distractions, and clarity of task instructions (Dornyei, 2009a; Liu € & Littlewood, 1997). Moreover, a learner's perception of a task is in part related to his or her perception of the L2 class, L2 course, institution and even the L2 itself (Dornyei, 2002€ ). When considering a task motivation model, this conglomerate is problematic in that interest is a contributing factor, but ‘Interest’ has been identified as a motivating conglomerate in itself (Section 2.3.1). Thus interest is inextricably intertwined with aspects of the task (topic, format, opportunity for autonomy, etc.) that spark that interest.

# 2.3.4. Vision

‘Vision’ is the motivational conglomerate most closely related to L2 learning motivation mentioned in models of WTC (see Section 2.1). Dornyei (2009b)€ outlines two aspects of the self, possible future selves, which contribute to vision: the ideal self, and the “ought-to” or feared self. The ideal self is the image a learner has of the L2 speaker she wants to become. Dornyei€ (2009b) argues that individuals are motivated to reduce the discrepancy between the actual and ideal self, while Eccles (2009) suggests that an individual will be motivated to participate in tasks that support his identity. In contrast, the “ought-to” self contributes to L2 learning by combining the expectations of others with the desire to avoid negative outcomes. As Dornyei (2009b) € points out, “focusing on what would happen if the original intention failed …is a powerful source of energy to keep us going” (p21e22). At the task level, ‘Vision’ could connect a given task to learners' goals for themselves as well as to their emotions and strategies for achieving those goals (Dornyei, 2009a € ). In the classroom, marks may be a significant aspect of vision both long-term and short-term (Gorham & Millette, 1997; Wardin & Lin, 2000).

# 2.4. Demotivation

To be truly dynamic, models of task-situated WTC must attempt to describe not the ideal, but the actual situation, which is affected by both motivating and demotivating factors. Demotivators have been defined as “specific external forces that reduce or diminish the motivational basis of a behavioral intention or an ongoing action” (Dornyei, 2001a € , p143). As with motivation, most research on demotivation has focused on general L2 learning demotivation rather than task-specific demotivation. One of the most commonly identified demotivators is inappropriate teaching methods, which refers to both course materials and teaching approach (e.g. grammar translation method) (Falout, Elwood, & Hood, 2009; Sakai & Kikuchi, 2009; Trang & Baldauf, 2007). Other L2 demotivating themes include teachers, class environment, experiences of failure and lack of interest in the L2 (Sakai & Kikuchi, 2009). However, research is lacking on factors that demotivate at the task level, as these likely differ somewhat from factors demotivating general L2 learning.

At a task level, ineffective or inappropriate tasks can certainly be demotivating. Rao (2002) interviewed 30 English majors from a university in China and found that they were not motivated to participate in communicative group tasks because they felt these tasks were ineffective in helping them develop skills to pass standardized English exams (see Pan & Block, 2011). This perception of communicative tasks as ineffective may be greater where a standardized exam culture is strong and encouraged, such as in Japan, Korea, mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong (Butler, 2011; Falout et al., 2009; Kim, 2012; Li & Baldauf, 2011; Warden & Lin, 2000). However, Ushioda (2001) found that for university students in Ireland learning French as an L2, aspects of tasks, such as irrelevant or boring topics, high difficulty, and role play formats, were demotivating. Other previously identified task-related demotivators include unclear instructions or poor introduction by the teacher (Gorham & Millette, 1997) and lack of authenticity (Leger & Storch, 2009).

Other possible task demotivators can be identified by considering negative aspects in relation to the above discussion. Language-related demotivators include language anxiety, which is part of models of WTC, and low perceived ability in relation to the task provided (Leger & Storch, 2009; MacIntyre & Legatto, 2011). Social demotivators could include power or status differences (Freiermuth & Jarrell, 2006) and not being familiar with the interlocutor (Cao & Philp, 2006).

# 3. Research questions

The existing literature on factors affecting group task WTC appears somewhat fragmented and research on demotivating factors in group tasks is particularly sparse. Moreover, these factors are not all included in Dornyei's (2009a) € motivational conglomerates, which are currently one of the few frameworks available when considering task WTC. Thus, the following research questions were proposed for the current study:

1. What motivates or demotivates Macau students to participate in group tasks in ESL class?   
2. Do motivators Macau students mention for task participation match Dornyei's (2009a)€ motivational conglomerates?

# 4. Materials and methods

# 4.1. Participants

The research participants were all ethnically Chinese residents of Macau studying in mandatory first-year English courses in Macau tertiary institutions. Individuals were recommended for participation on the basis of their English ability and apparent motivation or lack thereof when participating in group activities in English class. Using informal networking to locate participants means the sampling was not completely random, which is a common difficulty in Macau research (Morrison, 2006). To minimize bias, effort was made to ensure that a wide variety of students were interviewed. Samples were taken from two types of tertiary institutions: one a Chinese medium university (CM) which accepts students regardless of English proficiency, and one an English medium hospitality training institute (EM) which only accepts students who have passed both written and oral English entrance exams. In total 25 individuals participated (18 female, 7 male). Ages ranged from 18 to 20. Approximately equal numbers of participants came from each of the two schools (12 from CM, 13 from EM). Participants came from a variety of secondary school backgrounds and socioeconomic levels.

None of the participants were English majors, and they were studying a variety of different majors. All students had been studying English for at least 10 years. Recognizing that “learners most susceptible to demotivation are those with less L2 learning experience and those who are less proficient” (Falout et al., 2009, p.411), participants with lower proficiency (attending remedial English courses) were included in the study as well as students with higher proficiency (attending intermediate or mixed-level courses).

# 4.2. Methodology

Semi-structured focus group interviews (see Melles, 2004) were conducted with five groups of participants totaling 25 individuals. In two of the CM groups, the interviews were conducted bilingually with the assistance of an interpreter. In the third CM group and the two EM groups, the interviews were conducted entirely in English with the assistance of translation devices and participants interpreting for each other as needed. Participants signed bilingual informed consent forms, and were assured of confidentiality. Participation was entirely voluntary with no compensation provided.

The interviews were based on a set of focus questions with topics developed as participants mentioned and discussed themes important to them. Participants did most of the talking, though the author intervened to clarify statements, ask participants to elaborate, and encourage quiet participants to express their opinions (Melles, 2004; Ritchie & Lewis, 2003).

# 4.3. Focus group discussion questions

Initially, some common types of ELT group tasks were proposed as categories about which student attitudes could be explored separately: language games, role plays, small group discussions, and group projects. These categories include pair, small group and large group communicative tasks with a variety of formats and purposes. After interviewing a test group of participants, ‘group projects’ was removed from the list since a significant portion of students' course marks is based on the results of group projects, while participation in the other proposed tasks is relatively optional. Additionally, the ‘language games’ category was subdivided into ‘non-competitive language games’ and ‘competitive games’ since the test group's motivations for participating in these two types of activities differed greatly. This categorization does not cover every possible ELT group task, but rather several types frequently used in ELT classes and with which most Macau students were believed to have had experience.

During the focus group interview, students were asked about their specific motivations or reasons for participating or not participating in each of these four categories of group tasks in EFL classes. Examples of each category were provided during the interview to help clarify what type of task was being asked about (see Table 2). All participants indicated having had experience with competitive games, role-plays and small group discussions in English classes as university students and most had participated in all four activity types during secondary school. Thus motivators and demotivators identified were from an accumulation of experiences under various circumstances rather than one particular task experience.

# 4.4. Data handling and analysis

After transcribing the focus group discussions into English using standard orthography (Melles, 2004), content analysis based on whole groups was used to explore the interview data (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). The basic unit of analysis was the ‘theme’, and each mention of a theme was counted and indexed. Themes were not developed based on any theoretical model as the aim was to independently identify motivating and demotivating factors from what participants said. Refer to Appendix B for a sample of how a theme was developed. The number of times a theme was mentioned gave some indication of how important or widespread the idea was (Wilkinson, 2004 cited in Li & Baldauf, 2011). Mentions of themes in relation to general L2 learning, rather than task participation, were discounted from the analysis (8 mentions). Comments such as “depends on the topic” were counted twice: once under interest and once under disinterest. This was done since participants were identifying the topic as a factor that could either motivate or demotivate participation. Quotations using participants' original language help to develop each theme and facilitate understanding of its possible importance in affecting students' task WTC. To identify the source of quotations, each participant was given an identifying code indicating Chinese or English medium university, gender, and participant number; for example, EF3 was a female from the English medium university. Participants were provided with copies of the results to check for accuracy.

# 5. Results

5.1. Research question 1 e what motivates or demotivates Macau students to participate in group tasks in ESL class?

Participants mentioned twenty-two different factors that motivated them to participate in communicative tasks, which during analysis were consolidated into seven motivating themes: 1) Interest, 2) Perceived effectiveness, 3) Good groupmates, 4) Good classroom social situation, 5) Personal vision 6) Self-confidence, and 7) Marks. Demotivators were also indexed with eighteen factors identified from student comments. These were clustered under the six themes 1) Disinterest, 2) Inappropriateness for English level, 3) Bad groupmates, 4) Bad classroom atmosphere, 5) Lack of personal vision, and 6) Lack of confidence (see Table 3 for a listing of all factors combined into themes). The number and percentages of mentions under each theme can be seen in Table 4.

Research has found that learners attribute most L2 learning motivators to themselves while demotivators are mainly attributed to outside forces such as the teacher or course materials (Gorham & Millette, 1997; Trang & Baldauf, 2007). However, the majority of both motivating and demotivating factors identified were external forces, which suggests that the difference in internal/external motivation attribution is less pronounced for the group task situation. Interestingly, the motivating and demotivating themes mentioned were quite similar.

# 5.2.1. Interest

All of Dornyei's (2009a)€ motivating conglomerates were mentioned by participants in this study, but there was not a oneto-one correlation. As Dornyei's (2009a) € suggests, interest was a theme mentioned as a motivator for participation, though such mentions made up only $1 3 . 5 \%$ of comments on motivating influences. The attractiveness and easiness of topics in roleplays and group discussions was described as very important. Some students expressed interest in games because they broke the usual L2 class routine, confirming findings of Egbert (2003).

When you are just studying the book then you can see what you are going to do. But when you play games you can have something unexpected. So in a way you can jump out of class. Then it can be less boring sometimes (EF8).

# 5.2.2. Productive learner role

Likewise the importance of Productive Learner Role, which concerns social influences that affect WTC during the group task (Dornyei, 2009a€ ), was certainly evident. The identified themes “good groupmates” and “good classroom social situation” both relate to social influences, and mentions of these themes made up $5 2 \%$ of motivating mentions and $5 2 . 5 \%$ of demotivating mentions. Participants also discussed the importance of groupmates’ participation. Good groupmates were described as talkative in the L2, active, taking initiative, responsible, and perhaps most importantly having personal motivation to learn English.

I feel the most important point is the group members need to have hearts willing to study…In a group there are 4 to 5 people, if one person sits there and doesn't do anything, this already really affects the whole group's atmosphere. It makes the whole group not as good. So a heart willing to study is the most important. (CM4).

In contrast, when groupmates were not talkative and were uninterested in participating, “this makes the students who ant to take part lose initiative”(CM4). While several CM participants mentioned that having a partner with stronger L2 skills as motivating, several EM participants said that having groupmates with lower English abilities reduced their own WTC.

Sometimes your groupmates don't know what you talk about. So it doesn't mean we want to use Chinese but we must to express ourselves (EF5).

Moreover, participants said the classroom “atmosphere will push us to do something” (CM3). For example, seeing classmates eagerly participating in tasks increased participants’ willingness to join in. A good classroom atmosphere also increased WTC. “[At my previous school,] if you say something wrong, because our English level is about the same, if I make a mistake you can laugh. I laugh. We all laugh” (CM3). Some participants specifically mentioned a desire to further develop relationships with classmates and promote a good classroom atmosphere as encouraging them to participate in group tasks. In contrast, participants mentioned that a bad classroom atmosphere has a negative effect on task WTC. This classroom atmosphere was described as developed jointly by the classmates and the teacher, whose influence was through attitude toward students and choice of teaching methods.

# 5.2.3. Motivational flow

The experience of motivational flow was not mentioned by any participants; however, as predicted, aspects of the tasks did affect Macau students’ motivation to participate. In addition to Interest (see Section 5.2.1), perceived effectiveness was an important factor ( $6 . 5 \%$ of motivating and $2 1 \%$ of demotivating mentions). Tasks seen as productive for improving and practicing English skills were considered motivating For example, when talking about group discussions, one student said

Usually we really don't use English to talk. This really gives us a few more opportunities to use English and let our speaking skills improve (CM4).

Students also mentioned that they appreciated the chance to get new perspectives through participation in discussions and role-plays.

In contrast, tasks perceived as either too difficult or too simple for participants’ English abilities were considered demotivating. 18 comments (8 by EM and 10 by CM participants) indicated students felt certain activities were too difficult

I don't like competitive games because I think this is a bit difficult. Maybe my vocabulary is little so when I play the game I will not know what you are talking about (CM3).

This problem of not knowing enough English to understand one's partner was particularly apparent among participants who had weaker English abilities. However, students with stronger English abilities also commented on the difficulty of using English in group discussions.

I think of course if you want to use English it is better, but some words you don't know how to say in English so if you use Chinese it is better (EF8).

Overall, participant comments show that qualities of the task affect willingness to participate, but to what extent flow is part of a successful or motivating task experience is unclear.

# 5.2.4. Vision

Vision in the form of a future self, one aspect of Dornyei's (2009a)€ model, was indeed mentioned 15 times as a motivator for task participation and lack thereof was mentioned twice as a task demotivator; however, 14 of these mentions were made by only 2 people. This being said, participating to get marks, a kind of short-term vision, accounted for 26 $( 1 5 \% )$ of the motivating mentions in this study. Study participants clearly viewed marks as a motivator for participation in group activities, though some disliked having this pressure. In a positive light, participants made comments like:

I think I play this game just for extra credit (CM1).

If the game can give marks I think I would, I must try this (CM3).

In contrast, regarding role plays, one group responded:

The lecturer requests (EF2).

We have to do it (all laughing) (EF4).

If not, maybe [the teacher] will deduct our mark (EF3).

Although these participants talked about marks negatively, they still found the pressure of being marked motivating. “Marks” was the only theme without a corresponding demotivating side.

# 5.2.5. Self-confidence

Finally, though self-confidence is not part of the four conglomerates suggested by Dornyei (2009a)€ , comments about confidence, or the lack thereof, accounted for $4 \%$ of motivating and $1 5 . 5 \%$ of demotivating mentions in this study. In particular, most comments about self-confidence in group tasks revealed language anxiety. Participants talked about a fear of making errors, which contributed to the experience of embarrassment, nervousness, or “feeling strange” (CF1), as it was variously expressed. One participant commented “Maybe [being afraid to lose face] doesn't happen in America” (EF7), showing she suspected this language anxiety is cultural. Moreover, one participant pointed out that he would use Chinese in group discussions to avoid both self-confidence and relationships with group members being hurt in case of miscommunication using English.

I say something and you don't understand. You also don't understand what I'm saying. We both lose confidence. Also the relationship is hurt (CM3).

# 6. Discussion

# 6.1. Discussion of study findings

One goal of this study was to test whether Dornyei's descriptions of motivating conglomerates match motivators described € by Macau students. In regards to interest, the findings of this study clarify that interest is generally based on aspects of the task, though most participant comments did not differentiate what factor sparked the interest (e.g. topic, task type, novelty, etc.). This confirms Dornyei's de € finition of interest as motivational conglomerate because it acts, and is thought of, as a single unit despite being contributed to by a potentially great variety of factors.

In addition, this study's findings also confirm that for many learners, the partners for a task are very significant influences on task WTC. On one hand, the existence of mutual motivation (Dornyei, 2001b € ) is confirmed as well as the opposite, mutual demotivation. Having a demotivated groupmate can cause even personally motivated students to adopt negative attitudes toward a task and choose not to speak, a finding consistent with that of Falout et al. (2009). The factors that lead to the experience of mutual motivation, as opposed to mutual demotivation, are not clear, though relationship with the task partner appears to have an influence.

Moreover, findings suggest that social influences on task performance are not limited to the group members; the classroom atmosphere appears to have both push and pull effects on task WTC. In short, a good classroom atmosphere pulls learners to speak by increasing their desire to participate and also pushes them to speak by naturally reducing selfconsciousness. Van den Braden (2007) suggests this is because when partnered with someone they know in a positive, safe learning environment, learners are more willing to take risks with the L2. In contrast, a bad or negative classroom atmosphere can do exactly the opposite. The classroom atmosphere is particularly important for whole-class or large-group activities or discussions, but the effects carry over into small-group tasks as well.

The relative L2 ability of the task partner is also a significant factor affecting task WTC. Being partnered with a learner whose L2 ability was significantly different was described as motivating for weaker learners but reduced L2 WTC for stronger learners. Though such comments were classified as demotivators for the latter, the reality is that in some cases, motivation to communicate meaning with groupmates was relatively stronger than motivation to practice English, and thus the learners chose to use the L1 in the activity. Perhaps the concern among Chinese people for maintaining harmony and being part of a group (Hu, 2002; Jin & Cortazzi, 1998) compounded the importance of social influence, but similar phenomena likely occur elsewhere.

The effect of being marked, a short-term goal, appears to be a stronger task motivator than is long-term vision for many participants. 14 of the 17 comments on long-term vision as a motivator were made by two participants, which suggests that vision may only be a significant task motivator for those who have a particularly clear vision of their L2 goal, or a particularly strong drive to achieve that goal. Moreover, perhaps the future self (Dornyei, 2009b € ) was not mentioned more because, as CM4 pointed out, not everyone is thinking about the future when participating in group activities. Thus for most learners, the ideal self is likely a greater motivator for learning English in general or perhaps for individual tasks than for group tasks, particularly if the importance of the tasks for the future is not made clear. Indeed, for most participants in this study, the immediate requirement itself seemed to be a stronger task motivator than were longer-term goals. Thus giving marks for L2 output may be an ultimate motivator for those who lack interest in the task and the L2.

There are some limitations to the present study that limit the applicability of the findings to other situations. Due to the small sample size and the underrepresentation of less motivated and less proficient participants, some factors affecting task WTC may not have been mentioned in the present research study. A second weakness is that the interviews were conducted mainly in English, although most of the participants would have felt more comfortable using their mother tongue. Thus it is likely that some different opinions and ideas were expressed or were explained differently than if interviews had been conducted in Chinese (Cortazzi, Pilcher, & Jin, 2011). Finally, because participants were reporting based on memory, there may have been some inaccuracy and lack of clarity in their recollections, particularly regarding demotivating factors (see Ritchie et al., 2006 cited in MacIntyre, 2007). Despite these limitations, the findings have both confirmed and extended previous findings on group task WTC and are worth considering in creating a teacher- and researcher-friendly model.

# 6.2. Model of group task willingness to communicate

The following dynamic model of task situated WTC is suggested based on the review of literature and this study's findings (Fig. 3). This model retains a focus on the conglomerate level, since modeling based on individual aspects has largely failed (Dornyei, 2009a € ). However, broader conglomerates are suggested as some motivators mentioned in this study are not clearly part of the conglomerates Dornyei (2009a) € described. The model can be viewed as dynamic since throughout the period of task engagement, the conglomerates and their effect on WTC are constantly adjusting based on evaluation of how the task process is going (Dornyei € & Tseng, 2009; MacIntyre & Legatto, 2011).

A variety of factors contributes to each conglomerate of this model. ‘Learner Role’ may be influenced by various aspects of the classroom social situation including task partner(s), the teacher, the classroom atmosphere and the learning institution. ‘Perception of task’ is quite similar to Dornyei's (2009a) € conglomerate ‘Interest’ and is potentially contributed to by any number of task-related factors including those mentioned in Dornyei's (2009a)€ outline of the motivational flow conglomerate. ‘Perception of task’ is likewise nested within the class, course, institution and L2, all factors which could affect how the given task is perceived at a given point in time. Thirdly, ‘L2 learning motivation’ involves both short-term goals, such as getting extra credit marks, and possible influence of long-term vision.

![](img/42c143885b71ea323449d4ea530eee9cd46f0fbc8f81190f1b25bcd802f0c47e.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Proposed task situated WTC model.

Although ‘L2 communicative self-confidence’ is not a part of Dornyei's (2009a)€ conglomerates, it is included in this model for several reasons. First, it is a major component of other WTC models (e.g. MacIntyre et al., 1998; Yashima, 2002; Yashima et al., 2004), which show that this self-confidence is affected by factors like language anxiety and perceived ability. Second, regarding group tasks, self-confidence was also identified in Cao and Philps' (2006) study as a common influence on classroom WTC. Finally, in the present study, self-confidence and language anxiety were also mentioned as motivating, and more often demotivating participation. While the pressure to maintain face is thought to be stronger in Chinese and other Asian cultures than elsewhere, anxiety about L2 use affecting WTC has been recognized worldwide and thus the degree of L2 selfconfidence is certainly a factor in group task WTC for many learners.

This model shows a learner's perception of the task and learner role as directly preceding WTC in the task, rather than the task and learner role themselves. This is in consideration of Yashima's (2002) finding that perception of L2 ability was a more accurate predictor of WTC than was actual L2 competence (see also MacIntyre et al., 1998) and Egbert's (2003) emphasis on learners' perception of task qualities. In fact, a learner's perception of reality affects WTC more significantly than does the perception of the task designer, teacher, groupmates, etc. Moreover, ‘Motivational flow’ is excluded from the model because participants in this study never mentioned a flow experience and because whether an experience of flow, in which the learner ‘forgets’ he or she is using an L2 (Krashen, 1982 cited in Egbert, 2003), leads to greater WTC than when tasks are completed through conscious attention to language use is unclear.

One significant finding in this study is that the same themes, and even opposite aspects of the same factors, were mentioned when discussing both motivation and demotivation. Thus, neutral names have been given to the conglomerates so that the model can be used to describe factors both positively and negatively affecting task L2 production. The conglomerate names Dornyei (2009a) € suggests are all of positive features hoped for in students: Interest, Productive learner role, Vision, and Motivational flow. In describing an individual's experience, the only way to discuss demotivating factors would be to say the individual lacks one of these elements. However, in this study, participants' comments frequently showed that they were conflicted about participation, that in given tasks they were motivated for some reasons but demotivated for other reasons. Thus, using neutral names in the model allows for description of the total student experience including both motivating and demotivating aspects of each conglomerate.

# 7. Conclusions

Clearly to describe students as either motivated or demotivated to communicate in group tasks is too simplistic. Many of this study's participants mentioned both motivation and demotivation to participate in the same activity. On one hand this can be encouraging news, as it may be possible through appropriate task design and partnering to increase task-situated WTC even for students who lack L2 vision. On the other hand, this finding sheds light on the phenomenon of L2 learners with strong L2 learning motivation participating half-heartedly or mainly using their L1 in group work. Considering how frequently students mentioned demotivation in this study, continued research into the nature and influence of demotivators in L2 tasks is likely to be fruitful both for researchers and classroom teachers. Regardless, L2 teachers need to consider not only how to motivate their students to participate in group tasks, but also how to remove demotivating blocks to student participation.

The finding that social factors were mentioned so often by this study's participants has several implications for L2 teachers arranging group tasks. Firstly, the grouping of students for tasks should be carefully thought out. Most participants in this study seemed to believe that choosing their own groupmates leads to the greatest amount of participation. However, the usefulness of this approach needs to be confirmed as research in this area has mixed findings (see Dornyei € & Kormos, 2000; O'Sullivan, 2002). Moreover, teacher discretion should be used to prevent students who may not naturally gravitate towards any particular group from being exposed to ridicule from classmates and thus experiencing demotivation. In addition, teachers should think carefully about pairing weaker students with stronger students, a common practice, as the findings of this study suggest this may actually demotivate stronger students in given tasks, or at best reduce their L2 WTC. Secondly, teachers should pay attention to developing an encouraging, positive classroom atmosphere and arranging activities in order to increase student friendships and teamwork. Effort put into developing a good classroom atmosphere early in a course could pay off with stronger relationships in the classroom, greater task WTC and perhaps increased L2 learning motivation in general.

To help ensure that tasks assigned are perceived positively, teachers should carefully choose activities that can be engaged in productively by all students in the class regardless of L2 ability. To do this, teachers should come to class prepared with ideas to make an activity simpler or more challenging for individual students as necessary. To help students focus onwhat can be learned through a given group task, teachers could also provide a short rationale for the task prior to student engagement (Brown, 2009). Tailoring tasks to learners’ interests and L2 learning goals could also help increase task participation (Mackey, 2007).

The results of this study suggest a number of other avenues for research. Firstly, as an inductive model (Renninger, 2009), the model's accuracy should be tested by conducting studies with participants in other countries and learning situations, which could further explore the roles of culture, education system and institution in task-situated WTC. Secondly, statistical modeling techniques, such as Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), could be used to confirm the accuracy of the model and clarify how the conglomerates relate to each other and to contributing factors. Thirdly, considering different types of tasks ranging from individual form focused to group communicative tasks (Littlewood, 2004) would help clarify how the nature of tasks affects WTC and task motivation. Finally, research into task engagement could help in determining how flow is related to WTC and to what extent flow is part of productive engagement in group tasks.

# Appendix A

# Illustrative extract from transcribed focus group discussion

The following extract is taken from the transcription of a focus group discussion with participants from the English medium university. In the transcription, participant comments are preceded by an F or M to indicate gender, and a participant number. Comments without a preceding letter/number combination were made by the interviewer.

What about games, such as competitive games?   
F5 for fun   
F9 yes   
F7 sometimes for marks, bonus, or maybe just that day I am in a good mood   
F5 and the topic of the game, and the person you play games with.   
Would any of you not participate in a game like that?   
(silence)   
F5 sometimes it depends on which lecturer (girls laughing)   
F6 Sometimes we don't answer any questions   
F5 for example the lecturer we had yesterday, no matter if the game is interesting, we will just feel, oh my God! M3 I have a question I want to ask a long time, is that you guys and your friends are in the same class? What I mean is in igh school, the friends…

# Appendix B

# Example of how a theme was developed

Motivating and demotivating mentions were indexed separately. Participants mentioned five types of motivating social aspects. However, the description of a “good groupmate” was very rich, so the category was further divided into subcategories.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Social Motivations</td><td>Total mentions</td></tr><tr><td>Good groupmates</td><td>(52 mentions total)</td></tr><tr><td>Generic &quot;good&quot;</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Talkative in English</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Same interests</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Know them well</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Members of opposite sex</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Willing to learn from/teach other groupmates</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td> Motivated to learn English</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Good classroom atmosphere</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Teacher encouragement</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Chance to improve relationships/teamwork</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Peer pressure</td><td>3</td></tr></table></body></html>

Because the number of mentions of groupmates was relatively quite large, groupmates was considered a theme in its own right.

The context of the comments on peer pressure made it clear that this motivator referred to the overall class social situation, so this motivator was combined with “good classroom atmosphere” in the theme “Good classroom social situation”. Likewise, since several comments about teacher encouragement showed this improved or was a key to a good classroom atmosphere, this motivator was also combined with “good classroom social situation.”

The remaining social motivator, a desire to participate recognizing that doing so would improve one relationships with classmates/groupmates and/or improve one's teamwork ability with said classmates/groupmates, could apply equally well to the small-group level or the whole-class level. Thus it was decided not to consider this a separate theme, but rather to include it under the “good class social situation” theme.
