# ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible effects of conducting regular collaborative activities via Google Docs on English academic writing skills. Utilising a mixed methods design, this study was conducted with 24 Vietnamese high school students who participated in a fully online English as a foreign language (EFL) course in academic writing. The pre- and post-test results indicated that the students’ overall academic writing skills were significantly improved over the course. Regarding individual aspects of academic writing, there were significant improvements in the areas of task response and lexical resources, while the areas of cohesion and coherence and grammatical range and accuracy did not witness significant improvements. Further analysis of semi-structured interviews with these students revealed that they valued the usefulness of Google Docs-based collaboration in enhancing their English academic writing skills, however they held mixed opinions about the enjoyment of collaborating on the platform. This study also revealed a number of challenges experienced by this group of students when they used Google Docs in online collaboration. Implications and suggestions for future studies are discussed.

# 1.  Introduction

More than a decade ago, online learning was predicted to soon become a disruptive innovation and, with technology as the platform, student-centred learning would replace interdependencies (Christensen et  al., 2008). As predicted, online learning has become an increasingly popular option for education in the 21st century (Means et  al., 2014). In 2019, the number of learners enrolled in Coursera, one of the ‘Big

Three’ massive open online course (MOOC) providers, was 45 million (Shah, 2019). In early 2020, $9 8 \%$ of institutions in the USA moved in-person classes online (Education Data, 2020).

Despite its convenience and popularity and compared to face-to-face learning experiences, online learning has been criticised for its lack of social interactions between learners and its limited capability to bridge the physical distances between learners due to being asynchronous and involving primarily text-based delivery (Akcaoglu & Lee, 2018; Joanne & Tim, 2004; Veletsianos & Navarrete, 2012). Synchronous meetings, online forums, and the employment of collaborative learning activities are often suggested as effective methods to address these issues (Fung, 2004; Tu & Corry, 2003). Indeed, various studies have reported the positive impacts of different collaborative learning measures or activities on enhancing social presences and interpersonal interaction in online learning environments. Several examples of those measures can be using Facebook groups (Akcaoglu & Lee, 2018), online peer-editing via Google Docs (Ebadi & Rahimi, 2017), online collaboration via group assessment tasks (Bugden et  al., 2018), blog-based interactive online learning (Quadir et  al., 2019), blog-based peer responses in English academic writing (Pham & Usaha, 2016), or virtual exchanges (Hagley, 2021; O’Dowd, 2020; O’Dowd et  al., 2020).

Technology deems itself to be an effective tool for collaboration in education (Herrington et  al., 2010; Howland et  al., 2012). Web 2.0 alone can provide multimodal and ubiquitous ways to promote collaboration such as blogs, wikis, online forums, social networks, virtual exchanges, and other web-based projects (Hampel, 2009; Howland et  al., 2012; O’Dowd, 2020; O’Dowd et  al., 2020; Pham & Usaha, 2016; Rahimi & Fathi, 2021). Among common Web 2.0 technologies, Google Docs is a free and user-friendly application for students with a limited technology background. Compared to other Web 2.0 tools, Google Docs appears to be a more popular tool and has been used in various studies for peer-editing and peer-reviewing in collaborative writing worldwide (Abrams, 2016; Alharbi, 2020; Ebadi & Rahimi, 2017; Kessler et  al., 2012; Strobl, 2013).

Within a Vietnamese context, the popularity of online learning has led to an increased adoption of platforms including Google Docs, Google Meet and Google classroom by Vietnamese EFL teachers in their online classes (Dinh & Nguyen, 2020). However, recent studies revealed that teachers utilising online learning in Vietnam needed to further improve interactivity and enjoyment, increase students’ satisfaction of online learning (Dinh & Nguyen, 2020; Maheshwari, 2021) and enhance students’ intention to use this learning channel (Hoang & Hoang, under review). Particularly due to the solitary nature of academic writing, a consideration towards collaboration and interaction is essential in the online teaching of academic writing. Despite the popular affordance of Google Docs for collaborative writing in the peer-editing process, there is little empirical evidence about the application of Google Docs in different stages of writing in online learning where students do not have much opportunity to directly interact with each other. With the aim to enrich the existing literature of technology-enhanced collaboration, the study was conducted to investigate the use of Google Docs for collaborative activities in an English academic writing online course among a cohort of Vietnamese high school students. The study aims to address the following research questions:

1. To what extent were students’ English academic writing skills improved over an online course using Google Docs-based collaborative activities?   
2. What are high school students’ perceptions of collaborative learning in academic writing using Google Docs?

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Academic writing skills

Writing is both a productive skill and a cognitive construct that is significant for language acquisition (Hedgcock, 2005; Polio & Lee, 2017). Through writing, learners consolidate knowledge as well as construct new knowledge through internalization and restructuring (Williams, 2012). Unlike free writing or narratives, academic writing equips EFL and English as a second language (ESL) learners with the necessary academic literacy skills needed for academic success in English-medium institutions (Hedgcock, 2005).

Among common types of academic writing, the writing of academic essays is essential for international students to study in English at both undergraduate and postgraduate level (Bailey, 2014). In order to demonstrate English-language proficiency, students from an EFL or ESL background must prepare for and undertake the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), which is among the most popular large-scale high-stakes English language tests for students to certify their English proficiency (Saif et  al., 2021; Yang & Badger, 2015). One important component of the IELTS test is writing an academic essay with four assessment criteria including: task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy, with the band score ranging between 1 and 9 for each criterion. The IELTS test has been increasingly accepted as a comprehensive measure to assess students’ EFL/ESL academic writing competence and become the top-choice of test takers and institutions worldwide (Yang & Badger, 2015).

The idea of designing an online platform to teach academic writing skills to prospective IELTS participants started two decades ago at an institute of technology in New Zealand (Ayres, 2003). Since then, there have been numerous studies investigating the effects of learning IELTS academic writing skills in collaborative computer-mediated environments. Those studies, however, have provided mixed results. For example, a study by Ebadi and Rahimi (2017) reported significant improvements in IELTS writing skills by students using Google Docs compared to students in face-to-face classroom. On the contrary, Jiang et  al. (2021) compared face-to-face and computer-mediated collaborative learning in IELTS academic writing skills and found that students in face-to-face collaborative learning performed significantly better in IELTS essay writing than those in the computer-mediated collaborative learning. This reveals that further investigation is needed regarding technology-mediated collaborative learning in IELTS academic writing to yield a more comprehensive picture of the most effective strategies.

# 2.2.  Collaborative writing with technology

Research has shown that collaborative writing reflects the role of social interaction from socio-cultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978) and the role of interaction in conventional second language acquisition theories (Ellis, 1991, 2021; Long, 2014). Despite the solitary nature of writing, collaborative writing has been documented to have various benefits and positive effects on language learners’ writing process. For example, the planning stage in writing, when implemented collaboratively, results in increased accuracy (Ellis, 2021), writing fluency, syntactic complexity (Kang & Lee, 2019), and better writing performances (Ameri-Golestan & Dousti, 2015). While writing alone may cause anxieties or unwillingness due to lack of confidence, collaborative writing motivates students with a sense of shared goals and removes the feelings of sole responsibility for any shortcomings (Harmer, 2006). Research has revealed that collaborative writing enables learners to help each other produce and revise texts (Storch, 2013), ‘feed off ’ each other’s ideas and pool their resources (Ellis, 2021), co-struct their second language knowledge (Brooks & Swain, 2009), and receive immediate feedback (Storch, 2005). Jekiel (2014) compared individual pen and paper writing with web-based collaborative writing by ESL students and reported that these students demonstrated more complex ideas, better language use and content, and positive attitude towards collaboration in the web-based collaborative writing group.

To date, various technology tools have been used to facilitate collaborative writing and impacted writing development in many ways.

Common and affordable tools used in a number of studies include Wikis, Facebook groups, blogs, forums, and other web-based platforms (Chen & Brown, 2012; Zhang & Zou, 2021). Recently, emerging technologies have also been used to investigate the potential of these tools in facilitating writing development. For example, Chen et  al. (2019) used Google Earth Virtual Reality to support expository writing for young learners and reported statistically significant improvement in students’ writing skills and increased engagement in learning. Soleimani et  al. (2019) investigated pair writing with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) support in scaffolding abstract writing tasks for EFL students and reported higher scores in AR groups compared to the VR and paper-based groups. However, in these studies with emerging technologies, AR and VR were used as a stimulus for contextual interaction and additional resources to support the writing process, not as a major tool for collaborative writing.

Among technology tools to facilitate collaborative writing, Google Docs is among the most popular tool used in various studies as observed by Zhang and Zou (2021). Compared to emerging technologies like AR/ VR, Google Docs is free, familiar, and easily accessible to a wider population of learners. In addition to incorporating the most common features of word processors such as Microsoft Office, Google Docs facilitates group collaboration for multiusers on the same document saved on Google servers synchronously or asynchronously (Abrams, 2016). It allows online editing and enables the interaction and communication (e.g. via the comment function) between learners and teachers and between learners themselves (Ebadi & Rahimi, 2017, 2019; Godwin-Jones, 2008; Saeed & Al Qunayeer, 2020; Strobl, 2013). Google Docs also has the potential to help non-English students focus more on meaning than form in academic writing, enhance student engagement and learner autonomy in a virtual learning environment (Kessler et  al., 2012), and assist instructors to monitor learners’ writing performance (Chu & Kennedy, 2011).

Peer-editing and feedback facilitation are the prominent affordances of Google Docs as revealed in various studies. For instance, Ebadi and Rahimi (2017) used a mixed methods approach to investigate the impact of online dynamic assessment and peer-editing using Google Docs on EFL university learners’ academic writing skills in Iran. The study not only revealed significant improvements in students’ academic writing skills but also learners’ positive attitudes towards the use of these techniques on this platform. In a qualitative study by Alharbi (2020), Google Docs was used to facilitate collaborative revisions and feedback about article report writing for EFL university students in Saudi Arabia. In that study, Alharbi also reported similar findings in students’ positive views of Google Docs and its potential to support writing instruction through instructor and peer feedback, peer editing, and peer responses to feedback. Several other studies also pointed to the affordances of Google Docs in facilitating peer feedback and teacher feedback in EFL writing and collaborative work (Bradley & Thouësny, 2017; Gillow-Wiles & Niess, 2017; Saeed & Al Qunayeer, 2020; Yang, 2010).

Despite the popular use of Google Docs in peer-editing and collaborative feedback in the post-writing stage, little is known about its use in various steps of academic writing. Pedagogically, writing is a process rather than a product which involves a cycle of planning, drafting, revising, and editing (Ellis, 2021). Literature recommends that learners need a lot of scaffolding activities before they write their own texts (Ellis, 2021; Polio & Lee, 2017). Academic writing involves many other steps such as ideas generating and developing, vocabulary and sentence structures preparation, the writing process itself, editing, and further writing practice. More empirical evidence, therefore, is needed to provide a deeper understanding of how Google Docs can be used for collaboration in different stages of academic writing. The current study was conducted to fill this gap in the academic literature. Students’ perceptions of using Google Docs in collaborative academic writing were also investigated to substantiate the findings of the study.

# 3.  Methods

# 3.1.  Research design

The study adopted a sequential mixed-methods design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). The focus of the design was to use ‘a qualitative strand to explain initial quantitative results’ (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018, p. 77). This design involved two phases of data collection. The first phase was a quasi-experiment with one-group pretest-posttest design (Shadish et  al., 2002) using Google Docs for collaboration in an online English academic writing course over a semester. This quasi-experimental design is recommended when the research context and ethical concerns do not allow for the employment of an experimental design (Gopalan et  al., 2020). In our specific research context, given the limited number of the participants, it would not be practical to have a control group. While there was no control group to determine the ‘external validity’ of the effects that the intervention might have on participants (Gopalan et  al., 2020, p. 233), the quasi-experimental design that we employed can still produce strong inferences by reducing the ‘plausibility of alternative explanations for the treatment effect’ (Shadish et  al., 2002, p. 106). Moreover, we intended to triangulate and strengthen our inference on the facilitating role of Google Docs-based collaboration on the improvement of students’ English writing with a subsequent qualitative component. This second phase included semi-structured individual interviews among five randomly selected participants to explore their perceptions towards using Google Docs-based collaborative activities in the writing course.

# 3.2.  Participants

The participants of the current study were a cohort of 24 Vietnamese EFL high school students. They participated in the IELTS academic writing course in the study with the aim to take the IELTS test for personal reasons and to improve their academic writing skills. It should be noted that this was an extra-curricular course, and that they participated in the course and the research on a voluntary basis with their parents’ informed consent. An information letter was delivered to each of the participants and digital consent forms were obtained before data collection started.

# 3.3.  Procedure

The IELTS academic writing course was delivered in a 12-week semester with weekly synchronous meetings via Google Meet. Learning materials and homework activities were managed on Google Classroom. Google Docs was the main tool used for collaborative activities. Table 1 shows the weekly procedure of the whole course with each essay type covered in two weeks’ time. Figure 1 illustrates the major stages of instructing students how to write each essay type and how Google Docs was integrated for students to collaborate in each stage of writing.

As described in Figure 1, during the preparation stage students often worked synchronously together on Google Docs to expand their vocabulary by adding other word formations or less common vocabulary related to essay topics. The students also worked in pairs to brainstorm ideas and form the outlines for their coming essays. To provide an illustrative example of this process, Figure 2 shows a screenshot of an outlining activity which was completed as synchronous pair-work on this kind of platform.

During the writing practice stage, the two main collaborative activities students often engaged with on Google Docs were pair-work writing and teamwork writing (e.g. a racing team game in writing). Students communicated with each other either by typing their ideas directly on the document or using the comment function. The comment function was also utilised in a teamwork as illustrated in Figure 3.

suggestions using the comment boxes. Whichever group completed the essay first would be the winner. None of the collaborative products were graded, although they were saved in a shared Google Drive and accessible to all students for later review. Students also received individual homework asking them to write their own essays based on the topics which they had brainstormed and practiced with their peers during the in-class collaborative activities.

Towards the final stages of the writing procedure, students also participated in a collaborative peer-editing exercise utilising Google Docs. Individual homework was used for peer-editing and feedback in the next stage of revision and reflection in the following week. Students worked on their peers’ essays to give feedback and comments before the teacher gave her feedback.

# 3.4.  Data collection instruments

To investigate the possible effects of using Google Docs in online collaboration on students’ English academic writing skills, a pre-test and post-test in academic writing were used. To ensure the same difficulty level of the selected topics, both tests were adapted from the same workbook which was targeted at achieving a set band score (Brook-Hart & Jakeman, 2013) The IELTS band descriptors (IELTS, 2021) were used to mark students’ essays by the first author. Another IELTS instructor was invited to cross-mark pre-test and post-test essays. Both the first author and the invited instructor were experienced in delivering IELTS academic writing courses and attended several training workshops in teaching IELTS. They first marked the essays independently and then moderated their marks and discussed the differences to reach a final mark for each criterion. As suggested by Johnson et  al. (2005), discussion to improve score accuracy is one of the effective ways to enhance the reliability and the validity of reported scores.

Figure 3. S entence-by sentence racing team game as a type of collaborative writing on Google Docs.

In order to explore students’ perceptions towards the use of Google Docs in online collaboration thorough the course, semi-structured interviews were conducted via Zoom with five students randomly selected from the list of those who agreed to take part in the interviews on a voluntary basis. The interview questions were adapted from Ebadi and Rahimi (2017) (Appendix A). These interviews were conducted in students’ first language to avoid any misunderstanding. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

# 3.5.  Data analysis

Students’ essays in the pre-test and post-test were marked using the band descriptors for the IELTS Academic writing task 2 (IELTS, 2021).

A mark range of 0 to 9 was used to mark each of the four criteria (i.e. task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy) and the overall band scores were the mean values of these four academic writing dimensions. Means, standard deviations, and paired-samples $t { \cdot }$ -tests were computed to explore whether there was any significant improvement in students’ English academic writing skills over the online course using Google Docs. Given multiple comparison analyses conducted and the small sample size of the current study, the two following methods were employed to ensure the reliability of the tests. First, Bonferroni corrections were applied to set statistical significance to .01 levels (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). Second, all the $t { \cdot }$ -test analyses were bootstrapped with 1000 samples (i.e. randomly resampling the observed data 1000 times) to confirm or reject their results (Plonsky et  al., 2014).

Thematic analysis (Miles et  al., 2014) was used to analyse the interviews. In this inductive approach, we first coded our data openly to identify emergent themes. We then categorized codes in a hierarchy of concepts and themes. Interviewed students were labelled S1 (i.e. Student 1) to S5 to respect their privacy and personal information.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  Impacts of using Google Docs for online collaboration on academic writing skills

Table 2 presents the means of the overall band scores as well as those of the four dimensions of academic writing skills that student attained at the beginning (pre-test) and the end (post-test) of the course.

In general, these descriptive results showed the increases in mean values of overall band scores and those of the four dimensions over the online course. The results of paired sample $t { \cdot }$ -tests which explored the statistical significance of these increases are detailed in Table 3.

The results indicated that the mean value of overall band scores at pre-test was significantly lower than that at post-test (mean dif. $= - . 4 0$ , $\textstyle P ^ { \mathrm { ~ < ~ } . 0 0 1 ) }$ . In other words, students’ overall academic writing skills significantly improved over their online collaborative-learning course using Google Docs.

However, further paired sample $t$ -tests conducted among four individual criteria revealed that the statistical significance did not occur to all these four academic writing dimensions. While both lexical resources (mean dif. $= - . 5 8$ , $\textstyle P ^ { \mathrm { ~ < ~ } . 0 0 1 ) }$ ) and task response (mean dif. $= - . 5 0$ , $\textit { p } <$ .001) witnessed significant increases there were only a marginally significant increase in grammar range and accuracy (mean dif. $= - . 2 5 ,$ , $\boldsymbol { p }$ $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { \tau } . 0 1 1 \mathbf { \dot { \tau } } ,$ and an insignificant increase in coherence and cohesion (mean dif. $= - . 2 5$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p \ = \ . 0 8 3 , } \end{array}$ ).

In summary, the findings of the study indicated that, throughout this online course using Google Docs for collaboration, students’ English academic writing skills significantly improved, with the greatest improvements noted in the areas of lexical resources and task response. The qualitative results related to students’ perceptions of online collaboration with Google Docs are presented in the following section.

# 4.2.  Students’ perceptions of using Google Docs for collaboration in online learning

The analysis of interview data suggested some major themes emerging in relation to students’ perceptions about using Google Docs to collaborate in academic writing learning. The emergent themes and their sample references are presented in Table 4.

In general, each of the students who were interviewed acknowledged the suitability of different collaborative activities in all three stages of writing on Google Docs in facilitating their learning of academic writing skills. Specifically, students reported that they had more ideas and vocabulary related to the essay topics which had been contributed by their peers via the brainstorming pair/group work on Google Docs. This made it easier for them to outline the essay structures and expand the supporting ideas. Other students valued the collaborative writing with changing partners for each time. They stated that they learned from different writing styles and arguments from different partners, which was helpful for their academic writing skills. Each of the students interviewed also appreciated the peer-editing activities because Google Docs had enabled them to receive immediate feedback from the teacher and their peers, and simultaneously share their comments. Within the same file, students could re-read their own writing, see all other students’ comments and suggestions for revision, and learn new ideas from their peers. These findings may help to explain the improvements observed in the two areas of task response and lexical resources. These areas focus on the ability of the student to extend and support main ideas and use a range of vocabulary including uncommon ones. In addition, all students reported a range of technical affordances of Google Docs that were useful for their online collaboration and writing process, which a traditional classroom without technology support could not provide. These affordances included the followings: similar functions as Microsoft Word, easy generation of a new Word document, document saving and storage for later use, synchronous multiuser online editing, history of revision, searching tool within Google Docs, chatting, and commenting functions. The students also valued the free cost of using this platform to collaborate and interact with their peers and teacher.

Although there were a range of benefits and convenience of Google Docs as mentioned above, there were also some mixed findings regarding students’ enjoyment of working with the platform. For example, two interviewees preferred collaborating on this platform because it was more exciting and interactive for them. They reported that the various online collaborating activities made them work harder, which in turn made their learning about writing more productive. In addition, collaborating on Google Docs was favoured by students who considered themselves to be shy, who found it more comfortable to type ideas on Google Docs than saying them aloud in the traditional classroom. However, other students preferred collaboration in a traditional classroom because they liked the face-to-face interpersonal interaction and the noisy atmosphere of a real classroom. Student S5, for instance, preferred brainstorming ideas by verbally communicating with his classmates rather than typing them out on Google Docs. Working silently on the screen made him bored and tired. Student S1 found it annoying to wait for her peers to reply to her comments on Google Docs, whereas she could directly discuss the issues with them in a real classroom. Some students also preferred collaboration in a physical classroom because they could sense the presence of their partners. While working online, they could not check who was working in their team or not, due to the anonymity function of Google Docs. Furthermore, because of the nature of online learning, some students conducted web search for ideas or engaged in unrelated activities online, which caused distraction and slow responses. However, they all expressed their intention to continue using Google Docs because of its convenience and affordances.

The students also identified a number of difficulties they had while working with Google Docs. The most common issue was the slow response and inconvenience of Google Docs on mobile devices. Typing on the platform on mobile devices was much slower, and it was not easy to change to other applications like Zoom, Google Classroom or Google Meet. Therefore, they all agreed that Google Docs should be used on desktop or laptop. Another issue was related to health. Students reported that they had tired eyes and headache when they worked intensively on the screen too long. Slow and unstable internet connection also affected the multiuser interaction on Google Docs.

# 5.  Discussion

The current study aimed at investigating the effects of Google Docs-based collaborative activities in an online course on Vietnamese high school students’ English academic writing skills, and their perceptions towards using this application for collaboration. The findings of the study showed that students’ overall English academic writing skills were significantly improved over the course, with particularly significant developments in the two areas of lexical resources and task response. These findings are in alignment with previous studies (e.g. Ebadi & Rahimi, 2017, 2019) which found significant differences in students’ academic writing skills and lexical resources over an online course using Google Docs. However, the current study also indicated that there was only a marginally significant improvement in the area of grammatical range and accuracy, and an insignificant development in coherence and cohesion competence over the online course. The lower development of coherence and cohesion competence, however, is not unique to students in this study. While coherence and cohesion are the important indicators of academic writing quality (Connor, 1984; Witte & Faigley, 1981), previous studies showed that these aspects seemed to be ‘permanent challenges’ to EFL learners (Ahmed, 2010; Cekiso et  al., 2017).

Regarding grammatical range and accuracy, the negligible improvement in this area might be explained by the fact that our participants mainly received implicit grammar instructions from their peers and teachers via feedback and peer-editing rather than explicit grammar instructions. Indeed, several studies have revealed the more effectiveness of explicit grammar instruction in comparison to implicit one in improving second language learners’ grammar accuracy (Byrd, 2005; Norris & Ortega, 2000; Spada & Tomita, 2010).

The findings related to students’ perceived usefulness of Google Docs in facilitating academic writing skills are in agreement with various previous studies (Alharbi, 2020; Ebadi & Rahimi, 2017; Jiang et  al., 2021; Saeed & Al Qunayeer, 2020; Wang et  al., 2021) in which students valued peer support in ideas generating, peer-editing, peer feedback, and interaction on this platform. The current study also revealed numerous technical advantages of Google Docs such as digital storage, digital saving, revision history, and multiple uses for the in-built chat function. However, our participants expressed different viewpoints towards their experiences with the anonymity feature in Google Docs. While this was favoured by shy students who might not be confident in sharing their ideas, other students preferred knowing their partners’ identity in collaboration.

While students in this study agreed on the usefulness of Google Docs, they had mixed opinions about the enjoyment of learning with this tool. Several students reported that they did not feel motivated to practise academic writing skills on Google Docs. This finding contrasts with the findings of Zhang and Zou (2021), Alharbi (2020), and Abrams (2016) who found that Google Docs boosted learner’s motivation and made the learning process an enjoyable experience. When the students elaborated on their ‘demotivation’, they often referred to the lack of the transparency in teammate contributions, no immediate verbal communication, and a lack of real interpersonal interaction in their online course. They also discussed some of the many distractions that they were likely to encounter when participating in online classes. These findings suggested that perceived usefulness, though important, might not ensure students’ motivation and engagement in an online course. Indeed, several studies have reported that online learning engagement was significantly impacted by the authenticity of collaboration, family support, and real interaction with the instructors (Kurt et  al., 2021; Yates et  al., 2021).

Major technical issues such as slow internet access and incompatibility of Google Docs on mobile devices seemed not to be unique in an online learning study. When students were supposed to use their own mobile devices for learning, it would be difficult to ensure the equal digital access to Google Docs for everyone (McQuiggan et  al., 2015). Finally, health issues such as eye tiredness and headache due to the continuous use of the screen for a long time were reported. These have been found common in various studies which involved using technology (e.g. Dolgunsöz et  al., 2018). However, despite the challenges of using Google Docs, all students expressed their intention to continue using this tool in their future study.

# 6.  Conclusion

The study contributes by highlighting the benefits Google Docs in facilitating collaboration and ultimately the improvement of English academic writing skills in online learning platforms. The study findings have a number of implications. Pedagogically, the positive findings related to the platform’s impact on students’ overall academic writing performance may encourage teachers to consider integrating similar free and effective technology tools in their online classes to enhance interaction among learners and simultaneously support language development. The study also revealed several challenges and issues that may demotivate students to collaborate in Google Docs. Therefore, teachers should take students’ differences in learning styles into consideration when designing collaborative activities to ensure the effectiveness of online lessons. The study findings may also inform institution administrators to provide necessary technical supports so that teachers and students can have a favourable online learning environment where they can flexibly apply technology tools to enhance interaction in online learning.

There are a number of limitations of this study that need to be acknowledged. First, the study did not use a control group to compare, for example, the differences of collaboration using Google Docs and collaboration in a traditional classroom. While the findings have illustrated the role of Google Docs-based collaborative activities in facilitating students’ academic writing skills, the design of the current study did not allow us to attribute these improvements merely to online collaborative writing. Future studies, therefore, are encouraged to use a more rigorously experimental design with both control and experimental groups to yield more comprehensive results. The study was conducted among a small group of Vietnamese high school EFL students. Its results, therefore, may not be generalisable to other contexts. Future research is suggested to investigate the effectiveness of Google Docs in teaching English academic writing in a larger sample size. Furthermore, the study used the anonymity function of Google Docs in some of its activities to encourage reserved students. This, in reverse, was not welcome by some students who required to know the identity of their partners. To avoid this limitation, future studies should consider all participants’ opinion of using this function beforehand. Finally, this study employed collaborative activities on Google Docs in different stages of academic writing and investigated their overall impacts on academic writing skills. The study did not aim to compare the differences between each type of collaboration and between each stage of academic writing. This could be an open direction for future research to explore.
