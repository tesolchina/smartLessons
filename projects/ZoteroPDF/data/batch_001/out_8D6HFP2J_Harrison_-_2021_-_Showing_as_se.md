Building on research into the visual semiotics of slides and the multimodality of oral pre. sentations, this paper analyses the speech-gesture-slide interplay in TED talks and considers implications for teaching about gesture in the academic presentation genre. Using two examples from presentations by award-winning science communicator Professor Brian Cox, an enactiveecological approach to embodied communication yields fine-grained descriptions of relations between spoken language, visuals on the slide, and gesture including depictions, eye-gaze shifts, posture, and footwork. These demonstrate how the speaker's activity of showing slides is a person-environment dynamic of sense-making with the audience, and more specifically, how the speaker's speech-gesture-slide interplay animates, discloses, and decomposes aspects of the visuals on his slides while keeping his audience's attention intact. Whereas researchers of English for Academic Purposes have recommended raising students' awareness of multimodality or body language, this paper's findings suggest ways to sensitivise and engage students more directly and implicitly with the ecology of oral presentations.

# 1. Introduction

How can some students begin their oral presentation with seemingly proficient speech and naturalistic gestures, but ruin their opening by standing in the way of their powerpoint beamer, their sides projecting onto their shirt? How can other students seem to confidently pull ff the knowledgeable TED-style delivery replete with stock interactive gestures and a backdrop of attractiveslides, and yet they obviously have not researched their topic and are waffling? The first mishap might stem from a perceived lack of awareness of diffrent modes (Morell, 2015; Morell, Garcia, & Sanchez, 2008; Morton, 2006; Valeiras-Jurado, 2019), but the second one indicates a potentiall larger problem (which would also underwrite the first): misunderstandings about the ecology of oral presentations and the dynamism of person-environment relations. If such fundamental aspects of embodied sense-making are not also addressed, I contend, then raising students' awarenes of different modes and ther combinations may be insufficient for guiding students towards skilled practice.

As a prestigious academic genre, TED talks have received scholarly attention evaluating their potential as a pedagogical resource for teaching novice communicators about spoken language presentations (Coxhead, 2018; Wingrove, 2017). Studying the TED Talk genre multimodally has highlighted the centrality to this genre of gestures (Garcia Pinar & Pallja Lopez, 2018; Masi, 2019, 2020; Valeiras-Jurado, 2019; Wu & Qu, 2020). TED Talk studies join other strands of research examining the role of gesture in oral presentations, including studies of gesture in asssed expository speeches for foreign language classes (Busa, 2015; Carney, 2013;

Tabensky, 2008), multimodal discourse analyses of conference-style presentations (Ho0d & Forey, 2005; Morell 2015; Morellet al. 2008), and analyses of presenters' embodied interaction with visuals from other semiotic and interactional perspectives (Morton, 2006; Rende-Short, 2006; Knoblauch, 2008, 2013). Taken together, this research could guide the study of gestures i other academic genres (such as the 3MT; Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2003) and inform the design of pedagogical materials that embrace embodied views of language. Howeer, the is litle evidence that th teaching, ening, and asesment of gestre in (EAP) speaking activities is currently informed by such research, though a systematic materials analysis is lacking.

The current paper focuses on an under-studied aspect of TED Talk multimodality and academic presentations more generally - the speech-gesture-side interplay (which is an aspect of a wider speaker-audience-side interplay). Features of this interplay have been addressed in previous studies of visual semiotics, multimodalit, gesture, and performance studies. However, its dynamicity as a complex system awaits further study. Here, I propose to analyse the speech-gesture-slide interplay through an explicitly relational ontology, viewing the academic presentation as an ongoing dynamic or ecology in which presenters and their material and social environment are fundamentally entangled and continuously interact (Goodwin, 2018; Streck, 2017; Di Paolo, Cuffari, & De Jaegher. 2018; Ingold, 2011; Thibault, 2020; Harrison, 2020, in preparation).

To illuminate the interplay between language, gestures, slides, and the audience more specificlly, I draw on a situated practice of embodied sense-making called showing (Streeck, 2017). Initiall articulated in micro-ethnographic analyses f \*the ways in which one man copes with the communicative tasks of an average workday" (Streck, 2017, p. xvii), showing' is put to work here in analysing the speech-gesture-slide interplay in academic oral presentations. Examples from the TED Talks of an award-winning science communicator have been chose for ther high qualit, accessbilit online, and ther capacity to illsrate th showing of a highly skilled practitioner: astrophysicis Professor Brian Cox. The findings open a perspective from whichto consider previous proposals for enhancing presentation skills that involve gesture. Whether or not courses that prioritize students' identification of modes and combinations (Morell, 2015; Morellet al., 2008) ensure asuficient understanding of the speech-gesture-slide interplay will be dis cussed at the end of the paper. Showing as sense-making, I argue, can guide us in developing additional or alternative activities.

# 1.1. Visual semiotics in oral (academic) presentations

The importance of sides to the genre of oral academic presentation has been established at least since Dubois (1980), who observed the use of slides as "a kind of clothesline on which the components of the speech are strung" (p. 46). By analysing biomedical papers collected from a conference in the U.s., Dubois (1980) described the major slide content as being either lingustic or photographic and observed that slides could have several functions, such as presenting information \*quickly and sucesfully (p. 48), asisting retention, reinforcing information, and providing aditional interest, even diversion (p. 49). Dubois also saw that speakers could \*callattention to the general content of the slide" or "restate the key information' (Dubois, 1980, p. 49). Commenting briefly on embodied inter. action, Dubois observed how in presenting slides the speaker ordinarily moves from the lectern and faces sightly toward the screen" (p. 46). However, actual video footage was not analysed, her study being prior to the fed's \*full engagement with multimodal and semiotic practices" (Prior, 2012, p. 520).

The visual semiotics and periodicity of slides observed during academic conference presentations have also been analysed (Rowley-Jolivet, 2000, 2002, 2004; Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2003). By treating the academic presentation as a prototypical multimodal genre and inroducing a social semiotics perspective, Rowley-Jolivet and colleagues have demonstrated the importance of spatio-temporality in visual as  generic feature, elaborated on the different semiotic types of visuals, and analysed the role of visuals as a resource for situated meaning-making. The relation between the spoken verbal and visual components of slides is characterized as "one of synchronicity (Rowley-Jolivet, 2002, p. 21) and of "close correlation' (Rowley-Jolivet, 2004, p. 158), with the researcher often noting how the co-existence of the two channels of communication create  single textual space . which has to be processed as an integrated whole by the audience" (Rowley-Jolivet, 2002, p. 21; cf. Rowley-Jolivet, 200, 2004). This research has improved our understanding of the relation between visual semiotics and spoken language in the academic conference presentation, though without the data or methodology required to highlight the importance of gesture and the speaker's embodied interaction with the audience.

# 1.2. Gesture and multimodality in oral (academic) presentations

Much research has reported observations of gesture in the oral academic presentation with varying attention to gesture's relation to modalities like speech and visuals. Studies of gesture in reheared expository peeches by students in the context of EFL and other foreign language clases, for instance, have focused on the form, timing, and function of gestures (Busa, 2015; Caney, 2014; abensky, 2008). Research into academic presentation skill from the perspective of multimodal communication has stuated gesture within patterns of orchestration between modes. Several studies have aimed, for example, to operationalis systemic functional linguistics theory through the construct of body language' (Hood & Forey, 205; c.; Ha0 & Hood, 2019), to highlight the persuasive potentialof certain combinations of semiotic modes as a presentation skill Valeiras-Jurado & Ruiz-Madrid, 2019), and todistinguish between the different uses and combinations of modes that characterize levels of expertise in academic presentations (Morell, 2015; Morell t al. 2008). These findings have informed the design of courses in presentation skill that promote rasing students' awareness of multimodality as conducive to effective presentations (Morell et al., 2008; Morell, 2015; see Discussion). Other research analysing the interrelations between spoken language, gesture, and visual from different semiotic and semantic perspectives helps to elaborate on this multimodal view.

# 1.3. The speech-gesture-slide interplay

A dynamic interplay between speech, gestures, and slides has come into focus in a number of lines of research (Knoblauch, 2008, 2013; Masi, 2020; Morton, 2006). Joining research analyzing the multimodality of TED Talks (e.g., Masi, 2019; Valeiras-Jurado, 2019; Wu & Qu, 2020), Masi (2020) has demonstrated how \*the speakersattitude or stance towards, viewpoint on, or feeings about what is being talked about' (p. 163) may be realized multimodally through carefull timed combinations of spoken language, gesture, and slides. Specificlly, the researcher offered two examples of what she described as \*complex ensembles consisting of adjective-gesture-visual' (p. 16), demonstrating how the meanings of one element in the ensemble may emphasize reinforce, or restate the meanings of another.

Research in performance studies by Knoblauch indicates that the intimacy with which presenters may interact with their visuals is a property inherent to the powerpoint presentation format (Knoblauch, 2008, 2013). "Insofar as they use such equipment" Knoblauch (2008) writes, \*whatever speakers say may be understood as relating to whatever they show" (p. 88). Focusing on the multitude of ways in which speakers point to their slides including with different hand shapes, postural orientations, and pointing technologies), Knoblauch's research contests both the perceived objectivity of visuals (their technical visuality) and the clasification of gestures as functionally complementary. In a key example, a peaker uses the laser pointer on relevant parts of the image to overlay movement patterns that iconicll reresent the semantics of co-occurring erbal descriptors. For Knoblauch (2008), \*whil the slide represents a static view of various objects", the various gestures with the laser pen serve to "turn the static elements and the parts of the talk into a dynamic process (.83). An open question is how such relationality or dynamic process creates meaning with other kinds of gestures and visuals with the audience's attention intact.

# 1.4. Enactive-ecological approaches and 'showing' as sense-making

Perspectives on embodied interaction known as enactive or ecological' view person-environment relations as an ongoing dynamic in which people and their material and social environment are fundamentally entangled and continuously interact (Goodwin, 2018; Streck, 2017; Di Paolo t al, 2018; Ingold, 201; Thibault, 2020; Harrison, 2020, in preparation). Micro-ethnographer Streeck (2017), for instance, has established why \*meaning does not inhere in forms (of peech and body motion) but s a relationship between form and context" illstrating how for workers gathered on an automotie shop flor, \*each moment f understanding is the result of a local montage of heterogeneous resources" (p. xxvii). Goodwin (2018) rfers to this person-environment relation as an 'embodied participation framework', a small ecology in which different signs in different media (talk, the gesturing body and objects in the world) dynamicall interact with each other (Goodwin, 2018, p. 199). In Goodwin's (2018) studies at an archeological excavation site, "actions are examined that cannot be understood without simultaneous orientation to 1) language, 2) deictic gestures, and 3) structure in the environment .. as well as the mutual orientation of participants' bodies that create a shared focus of attention' (Goodwin, 2018, p. 221; emphasis added). Though working in different environments or ecologies, the practices observed by these researchers provide inroads to the relational dynamics of academic presentations.

Showing, for instance, was the term used by Streeck's (2017) own research participant - the manager of an automotive garage shopflor in Texas - to refer to his practice f explaining something to a customer or technician in the immediate presence of a car or car-related object)" (p. 166; emphasis original). This immediacy of material structures assciated with the explicandum is a characteristic of academic presentations to0, and both Rowley-Jolivet (2002, p. 25) and Knoblauch (2008, p. 88) have evoked the importance of showing' to this genre, though using this term non-technicall. Streck (2017) has theorised showing as sense-making and, with his focus on the garage owner's mbodie, environmentally-coupled interactions with others, identified abattery of practiced methods of showing at his disposal' (p. 164).? However, showing' as sense-making remains to be explored in the widely-recognized (but lss-well understood) speech-gesture-slide interplay.

# 2. Methodology

Examples of the speech-gesture-side interplay were sampled from two of three TED Talks by astrophysicist Professor Brian Cox: CERN's Supercollider (2008) and What Went Wrong at the LHC (2009). Cox has won awards for his work as a science communicator; his TED talks are publicly available on the oficial TED channel and permission can be requested for use in research and teaching purposes. In both talks, Cox's speech, gesture, and slide continuously interact in ways that implicate his audience's atention. The proposed boundry of analysis or this par is the onset and offse f ifferent isuals, idntifiable y a change in visl operated with a clicker and the speaker's segues.

Two examples of speech-gesture-slide interplay were selected based on their quality in terms of visibility (TED edits its videos for entertainment not for research; Xia, 2021) and their potential to inform our understanding of ongoing dynamics at play in Cox's two talks. This potential was operationalized as those moments in which the relations between speech, gesture, and slide were being made salient for the adc. lie is indicated, for example, y a ll-tale at fe shft in whch spakr shift gaz frmthr audience  focus mutual attention on gestures performed with speech (Steeck, 2009, ch. 5), which in this casi decribing aspects of visuals being shown on the slide. To indicate the commonality of the speech-gesture-slide interplay across Cox's talks and topics (within the domain of science), the two examples were taken from different talks.

Transcription and analysis were carried out in a Word document. The speech corresponding tothe given visuals including segues in and out of the visual) was copied from the transcript available on the TED website. This was checked for accuracy and laid out in a traditional transcript format with numbered lines corresponding to intonation units (Chafe, 198). The transcript was then enhanced for basic features of spoken language, including verbal strss on syllables (Celik, 2004, pp. 28-29) and micro-pauses within intonation units indicated wit a full-stop between parentheses (. Cox's operation of the slide clicker isvisible in the recordings and indicated in the transcript between double parentheses (click). His laughter was transcribed as hah', while the timing and extent of audience laughter is shown in the line below Cox's speech between square parentheses [hahah]. The slide's type of semiotic could be classfied following Rowley-Jolivet (2000, 2002, 2004).

The two selected episodes were examined for gestures (Harrison, 2018; Kendon, 2004; McNeil, 1992). Manifestly central to both examples was a gestural practice called depiction' (Streeck, 2009, chap. 6; see also; Clark, 2016; Stevens & Harrison, 2019; Hsu, Brone, & Feyaers, 2021). As can be distilld from Streecks acounts of depiction (Streeck, 2008, 2009, descriing, analyzing, and interpreting depictions requires atention to the interplay of several features. These include the speaker's creation of an atentional focus or stage for the gestures. This is dynamically created, maintained, and adjusted to over the course of a depiction through gaze orientation, head movements, posture shifts and linguistic devices like deictic pronouns and pauses. Useful descriptors for gaze can include theelements of the environment towards which eye-gaze i visibly directed, such as the audience ('mutual gaze),the proected slides, regions of space (in front/to the side), and the gesturing hands. Head movements (sideways, upwards, downwards, et.) are part of gaze shifts but may also result i stance-taking gestures and perspectival shifts such as the head tilt or head cock' (Calbris, 1990). In addition to gaze and head movement, the speaker's footwork relative to the audience show changing bodily orientations and positioning during an episode of depiction (stepping forwards, backwards, sideways, towards, etc.).

Interwoven with these dynamically embodied configurations, we may atend specificall to manual gestures. Several represen tational devices are known to take part in depictions. Miller, ressem, and Ladewig (2013) usefully advocate asking \*what are the hands actually doing when they are transformed into gesture?" (p.712). Answers may include: acting, molding, drawing or tracing, and representing (Millr et l., 2013). Streeck (2009) demonstrates that elaborate depictions often \*build up imagery of a setting over extended sequences" involving several spoken utterances with which the gestures collaborate (p. 122; Stevens & Harrison, 2019). In oral presentations, the seting being depicted by the speaker's gesture may also be related to (i.collaborating with) the visuals on the slide (Knoblauch, 2008; Masi, 2020; Morton, 2006). The analysis of depictions thus takes into account rlations between the gestures, the co-occurring speech, the details of the visual, and the attentional focus or stage being created, adjusted, and maintained with respect to the audience. The temporal and structural details of these relations can also be examined. As explained in the Linguistic Annotation ystm for Gestures (Bress, Ladwig, & Miller, 2013), a close analysis of esturestimig wth spech requires attenion to gesture units and phases (preparation, stroke, rtraction and holds), while distinctions in gesture's structure can be described where helpul in tems of form features (handshape, palm orientation, location, and motion). In addition to depictive episodes, the speaker in my examples performed some gestures whose forms and functions are welldocumented as recurrent gestures' (Harrison, 2018; Ladewig, 2014).

A final methodological stage involves preparing these analyses for presentation within the manuscript. For both examples, the verbal transcripts of speech are first presented in full then analysed in more detail throughout the relevant section, which is inter spersed with framegrabs from the video on the TED website.

# 3. Analysis

The examples to be shown illustrate different methods of showing (Streeck, 2017), which are ways in which the speaker, through depictions in this case, "makes object intelligible, discloses their dispositions and hidden feature, reveals how they behave within their material and practical contexts, and prefigures actions to be taken on them ... (p.202). The objects being shown are projected onto the visuals on a large creen behind Cox - a piece of scientific equipment in example 1 and a graph in example 2. Streeck (2017) identified several methods of 'showing' in his data, of which two willguide my analyses of the examples: disclosing and decomposing (Streeck, 2017, Ch.4). When speakers disclose, their sense-making behaviors make aparent or transparent certain features of objects and settings that might not be visibl to their addresse (p. 171). When they decompose, they show that something semingly whole or intact can be \*indexically or figuratively" decomposed, that is shown to be "made of separate parts" (Streck, 2017, p. 185).

# 3.1. Disclosing features and behaviors of LHC magnets

Our first example runs from 01:19 to 01:57 in the talk What Went Wrong at the LHC. Having introduced the scientific experiment underway at CERN (the Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire), in this segment Cox is showing and explaining the manufacturing defect at the origin of the problem. This defect occurred because of wiring between two large magnets, which Cox presents to the audience on his slide with a visual we can class following Rowley-Jolivet (2004) as afigurative semiotic involving scientific apparatus (Fig. 1).

At 01:19, Cox has not yet shown this side, but segues into it by saying \*about a week later we had a problem with the machine related actually to these bits of wire here () these gold wires (Transcript 1 L12) During this segue, the TED video is focused on the slides so we cannot see what Cox is doing or where he is ooking, but in the pause between here" and \*these', the slides change (operated by Cox's clicker), and as he says \*these gold wires, an animation occurs which places a yellow spotlight over the wires (cf. bottom right of Fig.1). With the timing of Cox's slide change, his use of deictic ronouns (these"), and his slide animation, we perceive the speaker doing deixis (Rende-Short, 2006), which means bringing \*both talk and nonverbal actions" into relation in order \*to invite the audience to focus on a particular part of the image" and in doing so, incorporating th relevant part of the mage . intothe ongoing talk' (p. 108).

Cox spends the next 20s explaining the technical properties of the wires (01:25 to 01:44). During this explanation, he is gazing at the audience and gesturing. Since this explanation is aside note addressed to \*the engineers" in the audience, and Cox's gestures are mostly out of shot, I elide it from my transcript (Transcript 1).

Transcript 1. Manufacturing Defect (What Went Wrong at the LHC; 01:20).

1 about a WEEK later we had a PROblem with the machine   
2 related actually to these (.) bits of wIRE here ((click)) these gold wires   
: (8 utterances explaining how the wires carry electrical current)   
3 in ONE of the joins between over NINE thousand MAgnets in the LHC   
4 er there was a manuFActuring defect so the wire heated up slightly   
5 and its THIRteen thousand amps suddenly enCOUNtered electrical resistance   
6 erm (.)((click)) THIS was the result hah   
7 [hahahahaha]   
8 now (.) THAT's more impressive when you consider those MAGnets weigh over 20 TONs

In line 3, Cox reverts to explaining the manufacturing defect. He starts by saying \*in one of the joins, begins to gesture, and shift his eye-gaze from the audience to his hands (Fig. 2). This is the start of a depictive gestural sequence that will represent the magnets. and in conjunction with speech, will disclose features of their problem.

As can be seen in Fig.2, both hands are in a flapped hand shape, positioned so that the finger tips are opposit each other almost in contact. Timed to occur with \*in one of the joins" and montaged with his picture on the slide, the gesture form can be interpreted as depicting a miniature of the machinery, each hand representing a magnet, the spacein-between the hands being the join where wires can be inferred. Whereas the visual depicts the machinery in two dimensions, this gesture models in three dimensions, and whil the image on the slide portrays the machinery from one perspective, Cox's head-tilt and eye-gaze shift towards his own hands introduces another - that of an observer standing ehind' and peering over the machine depicted gesturall. Since this gaze-shift follows from a mutual gaze with the audience furthermore, Cox's "turn to the hands" (Streeck, 2009, p. 85) invites the audience to join him in attending explicitly to the gestural depiction (on a look where I look' principle). Such perceptual nudges having implications for mutual orientation and, accordingly, speaker-audience intersubjectivity.

Fig. 2. "in ONE of the joins".

Holding this gesture momentarily, Cox looks back at the audience and says "between over 9,000 magnets in the LHC" (line 3) offering this background information whilst rhythmicall beating his gesture on the four syllables of \*thou-sand mag-nets' (Fig. 3). He is now going to develop the gestural depiction to show precisely what that problem with the magnets was, and thereby, animate the two-dimensional picture on the slide with his three-dimensional modeling through gesture.

As Cox says there was a manufacturing defect (line 4), he shift gaze (and plausibly audience attention) back to the gesture. This time, he tilts his hed to the opposite side to be looking atthe sture from ye  new angle, and he rases the stur into  higher, more salient space. With the words "manufacturing defect, he rotates his wrists clockwise/anti-clockwise (Fig. 4).

If Cox's hands are depicting the machine - as the gesture's iconicit, co-occurring speech and slide would suggest - then rotating the wrist discloses a certain play between the magnets. Taken in conjunction with co-occurring speech, a new meaning potentially emerges: the \*manufacturing default\* was related to (and possblycaused by) the play between the two magnets. Yet ifaccepted, this relation is neither mentioned in speech nor visible on the slide. The play of rotating wrists could alternatively be only metonymic of some instability or a problem, rather than depicting the way the magnets actually moved.

Cox continues "so the wire heated up slightly" (line 4). With this utterance he shifts gaze from his hands to the audience and performs a different gesture. His hands are ket in the same ocation but change shape from flat to precision grip configurations (pads of index and thumb are in contact), which are moved horizontally away from each other (Fig. 5).

Because Cox is talking about \*the wire, a feature of the machine highlighted on the visual behind him, we can explore the interpretation of the gesture as representing the wire. Whereas in the previous gesture, the flat hands were iconic of the magnets the precision grip enacts holding a smal oject and the horizontal movement conveys the spatial extet of this object, namely a wire. Note how the wire inferred by Cox's precision grip gesture is of equal size to the previously depicted machinery, meaning the gesture operates a zoom, again not present on the slide. With the word \*slightly, Cox's hands are held at the end of this trajectory and rhythmically beat with each of the two syllables ("slight-ly") before being retracted.

Fig. 4. "There was a manuFActuring defect'.

Cox completes his explanation of this defect by saying \*and its THIRteen thousand amps suddenly enCOUNTered electrical resistance (line 5). With this utterance, his gesturing undergoes a shift in functionality. On \*and its THIRteen thousand amps", Cox is looking at a different region/person of his audience and performs a ring gesture often associated wit the rhetorical aim of making precise (Kendon, 2004), a meta-pragmatic use of gesture to handle speech (Streck, 2009, chapter 8) (Fig.6). Then, with \*suddenly encountered (electrical reistance), he performs a gesture with both arms sweping outwards from the space in front of his body (Fig. 7). The movement and acceleration of this gesture convey the sense of (and would be sensed by the audience as) the sudden force with which the encounter took place, and in doing so, they set the scene for his imminent segue.

As Cox completes this utterance with the words "electrical resistance', he is shfing his gaze to the clicker in his right hand on "electrical" and then, having presumably checked his thumb is in the right place for a click, back to the audience on "restance'. He now says "erm () THIS was the result hah line 6). With the stressed deictic \*THIS, he clicks to show the next side which reveals an image of the mangled magnets (Fig. 8). The audience laugh (line 7), and Cox continues with an utterance in which \*that" and \*those" now refer to what is being shown on the new slide (line 8).

Masi (2019) observed that for some visuals in TED Talks, \*the function was found to be contextually determined, e.g. through a contrast with a former visual' (p. 165). Dubois (1980) also noted that \*a change in slide most often indicates a major division of thought, a spoken paragraph' (p. 46), while Rowley-Jolivet (2002, 2004) showed that shifts between diffrent visuals may play discourse marking functions. Such visual contrast, division, or conjunction is salient to Cox's segue, which creates a big reveal of the impressively damaged magnets. And while illers and hesitations are traditionally viewed with scorn by speech coaches, Cox's "erm" and subsequent pause during the segue contribute not only to its rhetoricaleffect, but also to its intersubjective affect (judging by audience laughter).

# 3.2. Decomposing the standard model of forces

The second example is from the tlk CERN Supercolider delivered by Cox at an official TED conference in 2008. In the segment under study, Cox willbe showing the Standard Model of particle physics on the slide behind him with a graphical semiotic (Rowley-Jolivet, 2002), a classc line graph wellknown to physicists. The graph plots three fundamental forces of nature: the electromagnetic force (red), weak nuclar force (green), and strong nuclea force (blue). As the energy of these forces increases (x-axis) thir strengths also change (y-axis). Whereas the electromagnetic force decreases, the nuclear forces increase. The graph shows at which energy the relative strengths of al thre forces intersect. Such is the explanation that Cox will (more deftly) impart on his audience through the practice of showing, central to which is a sequence of depiction.

According to Cox, the intersection and seeming convergence of these force i one of the big problems" that research at the CERN supercollider is designed to address Having segued into this slide, and without mentioning the Standard Model or explicitl asking the audience to look at the graph, Cox is going to establish this convergence's importance. He willfirst multimodall smulate the changing of strength of the diffrent forces over time (he runs' the model for the audience), then in a practice of showing similar to decom posing (descried  Streeck, 2017, pp. 185, 202), Cox wil clarify the traectory of tw specifi value the electromagntic force and the strong force).

Fig. 9. \*The big problems (.) in particle physics".

Wrapping up a joke and clicking into a new slide (line 1), Cox's first utterance concludes his previous point about \*what the LHC will find' (line 2). He is looking at his audience and contextualising what he is about to say as among the big problems in particle physics (line 4), while performing palm up open hand or presentational' gestures that associate with the giving or expecting to receive of information (Fig. 9; see Tabensky, 2008). As he segues into the new topic, he rotates posture, gaze direction, and his gesturing hand (now a Palm Addressed' form; Kendon, 2004, p.265) towards the slide and says \*theres aNOther isue" (line 6, Fig. 10).

Fig. 13. "As you GO back in TIme'.

Cox's spatial positioning between audience and slide here is, for Knoblauch (2008), \*an essential feature of powerpoint perfor. mances" (p.84) showing that during a presentation, the screen and the slide appear in the position of a third party in an interaction" (p.85). As Cox is gesturing towards the audience, then turning to his side and announcing \*another isue", we can recognize with Rendle-Short (206) that \*an expectation is (being) set up that the current image visible on the screen is relevant to the tlk' (p. 108) This expectation provides an interpretive framework for the audience to perceive the forms of Cox's speech and gestures to follow.

As he introduces the issue, he loks away from the slide and says "which is that the FORces in NAture" (line 6) whil looking down at his hands that are prearing to gesture (Fig.11). He then looks at the audience and stes towards them uttring t's quite eautifl actually (line 7; ig. 12). This gaze shift pproaching body, and parenthetical evaluation conspire to engage the audience' attention, While also projecting and justifying the speaker's elaboration as to why the isue shown on the slide is "beautiful'. The clause-final discourse marker actually treats this evaluation as counterpositional and thus also contributes to "performed intersubjectivity' (Clift, 2001, p. 265).

In this new stance, Cox continues his sentence (whose grammatical subject was the forces of nature) by saying "sem as you GO back in TIme () they seem to CHAAnge instrength line 8). With each of these clauses (as you GO back in TIme" and \*they seem to CHAAnge in strength), he performs the same gesture, once with each clause: both hands are shaped flat with the palms down, moving diagonally inwards/upwards so as to converge (Fig. 13). Because we know he is talking about the standard model on the slide behind him, the form of his hands could be interpreted as depicting the lines on the graph, and if that is the case, then by moving his hands together he is animating the model. Taking the precise content of speech into account, this movement would firs show the forces going back in time (clause 1) and thereby compress 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang into asplit second. Repeating the movement withthe elongated \*CHAAnge in strength would then show the forces strengthening or weakening (clause 2). Keeing his audience's attention bound up with this depiction, note that ox alsoshifts gaze orientation (head tilt and eye direction) with each performance: irst from the audience to the gesture with clause 1 (ig. 13), then back to the audience with clause 2 (Fig. 14). As he clarifies \*wel they DO change in strength' (line 9), he interrupts this depiction with a palm up open hand gesture, further inviting his audience to bodily engage with this proposition (Fig. 15).

Fig. 15. "Well they DO change in strength".

The graph Cox is explaining is stic and time invariant, but in this depictive sement, Cox has animated the graph, introduced time, and run the model twice - correlating time with strength. By introducing time as a factor facilitated by theaffordances of gesture to compress time), urthermore he has hinted at the relevance of the ER supercollider, which aims to recreate the conditions present in the universe immediately fter the ig Bang. Notealso the intersemiotic parallism, the angular form of the gesture and the lines on the graph showing a\*cohesive relation that interconnects both language and images when the two semiotic components share asimilar form" (Liu & O'Halloran, 2009, p. 372).

In the nex stage of his explanation, which also enfolds with the same visual, Cox will now treat each of the forces individually. The method of showing that Streeck (2017) terms decomposing may guide us here i referring to the way speakers often explain how "an object might be divided up or taken apart" (p. 202). He begins with "so the electromagNEtic force" (line 10), stepping his right foot back and rotating his body so as to open a space on his left where he is going to gesture, while hfting eye-gaze to his hand, which has adopted the shape used in the previous sequence to depict the lines (Fig. 16). He momentaril iterrupts this configurationto interject a defintion of the electromagnetic force as \*the force that holds us together (line 10), with which he shift gaze to the audience and gestures with both fists clenched - a kinesthetic image of something being held together or more abstractly a sense of force (Fig. 17). Returning his gaze to the gestre, his lft hand trae diagonal line from bottomright to top left while Cox says tssRger as you go to higher temperatures (lie 1). This line is traced with a precision grip hand shape (pads of thumb and index in contact) moving diagonally upwards. With \*gets STRONger, he is gazing at this gesture (Fig. 18), then while he is completing the gesture with \*as you go to higher temperatures', he shifts gaze back to his audience, as if to gauge their attention (Fig. 19).

Fig. 17. "The force that holds us together'.

Cox is now going to introduce one of the two forces that illstrate the opposit trend till loking at his audience, he says \*the strong force (line 12) while adjusting his forelimbs to adopt the reverse configuration - lowering his lft hand, rasing his right hand and tilting his head to the opposite side (Fig. 20). He quickly clarifies he means \*thestrong nuclear force" (line 12) and pre-empts the gesture he is going to make by bringing the hands together along the diagonal axis opposite to that used in the last gesture. He abandons the gesture momentarily, dropping his hands and clarifying \*which sticks nuclei together (Fig. 21), then redoes the gesture with "gets weaker' (line 13),this time tracking his hands with eye-gaze and accordingly tilting his head backwards (Fig. 22)

Note how the speech is characterized by a parall structure \*the electromagnetic force . gets stronger /the strong force . gets weaker, while asimilar parallism i aso exhibited inthe gestures in terms of axes and movement. The fact he completely interrupts this depiction to parentheticallyclarify part of his explanation (which sticks nuclei together; Fig. 21) portrays the speech-gestureslide interplay as dynamically adaptive to the needs of the moment, which may include a flash decision to addressan intersubjec. tively perceived need for clarification.

Fig. 19. "As you go to higher temperatures".

Having animated the model and shown what its diffrent components mean, Cox now relates his depiction more explicitly to the graph on the slide behind him. Stopping gesturing and turning to the slide, he says \*and what you see", then turns back to the audience to complete his utterance \*in the standard model line 14). As he briefly interects with \*you can calculate how these change" (line 15), he redoes a gesture similar to the original two-handed gesture showing convergence (cf.Figs. 13 and 14). Cox continues \*is the forces, thethre forces, other than gravity almost sem to come together at one point (line 16-17), though gestures are not visible now as TED has panned to the side. Finall, in lies 18-20, Cox makes a concluding statement, cohesively repeating his assessment about the beauty of this phenomena, before his segue into the topic's next stage \*now there's a theory called SUpermmetry line 20), on which he clicks after "theory" to activate the appearance of new visuals on his slide.

Fig. 21. "Which sticks nuclei together'.

Engaging in the communicative practice of showing (Streeck, 2017), Cox displayed a graph depicting the Standard Model on his slide, and with this graph behind him, engaged his audience with the complexity of its deceptive beauty. With his speech and gesture animating this graph, Cox first ran the model by depicting the global trajectory of is lines whilst relating these linguisically to the notions of time and strngth. He then trated ach force indviduall, or in terms of visual pertion, eleatd figure from its ground (Streeck, 2017, p. 186). Cox's parallelisms in speech and gesture contributed aesthetic quality to his explanation, helping onlookers understand and admire quantum phenomena. Observable footwork during this example, while emphasizing the whole-bodied nature of the oral presentation genre, also highlighted the importance that Cox visibly and physicall attributes to his depictive gestures.

# 4. Discussion

Building on research into the visual semiotics of slides and the multimodality of oral presentations, then paper identified a speech. gesture-slide interplay as salient to the ecology of the spoken academic genre. An enactive-ecological approach to embodied communication framed the speaker's activity of showing slides as a person-environment process of sense-making with the audience (Streeck, 2017; Goodwin, 2018). Analysing examples from award-winning science communicator Professor Brian Cox, fine-grained descriptions of relations between speaker, language, slide, and gesture including eye-gaze shift, posture, and footwork have demonstrated how the speaker's speech-gesture-slide interplay animates, discloses, decomposes, and otherwise analyses aspects of the visuals on his slides with his audiences attention intact. The implications of showing as sense-making for teaching and asssing gesture as presentation skill, however, remain yet to be explored.

Some researchers of oral presentations have suggested which forms and functions of gestures might be taught (Busa, 2015; Carney, 2014; Wu & Qu, 2020). The idea of formal instruction about spontaneously produced gestures for other researchers is "simply un. thinkable" (Tabensky, 2008, p. 318). Where much thinking about how to teach multimodal aspects of diffrent academic genres has taken place is the area of 'multimodal pedagogy' (Hafner & Millr, 2018, Ch. 7). Several classrom activities dedicated to gesture in oral presentations have also been proposed in the litrature (see Busa, 2010; 2015; Carney, 2013; Morell et al., 2008). A detailed discussion of one proposal in particular helps to highlight how this paper's findings may contribute.

Multimodality researchers Morell et al. (2008), for instance, offer students explicit instruction on \*the verbal and non-verbal language that wil help to link and organize our spoken multimodal discourse" (p.59). At the start of thir course they elict students' awareness of distinct \*spoken, written, image and body language" modes, draw thir intention to sequences of modes as consecutive' or simultaneous', then require per-review of each other's presentations ollowing an evaluation grid. Most relevant to the speech-gesture-slide interplay, this grid includes yes/no questions as to whether dfferent modes were used or not and if their use was 'appropriate', 'effective', and 'good' (p. 565; Fig. 23).

Triangulating their students' peer evaluation with the researchers own multimodal analysis, Morell et al. (2008) found that "speakers with a higher competence level in English tend to use a greater variety and combination of modes", and that the speakers using more modes came across to their peers "as a good communicator (p. 564). This finding is the researchers basis for their main pedagogical recommendation that \*courses to aid non-native English speaking academics should emphasize the use of multimodality" (Morell et al., 2008, p. 567; Morell, 2015; see also Busa, 2010).

Teaching students to decompose a presentation into different modes and then identify multimodal patterns, however, seems in tension with the understanding of the person-environment relations on which practices like showing have been demonstrated to rely (Streeck, 2017). Consider that showing was identified by Streeck (2017) not among patterns or configurations of modes but among his car mechanic's practices, that is, "methods for doing things" that were "enacted through movements of the body", "skilled, methodical, locally adaptive", "nested'" and "socially implicative' (pp.7-8). Embodied actions like gestures, eye-gaze shifts, and postures are not seen as distinct signals or messages channeled within a body language mode (cf Streeck, 2020, p. 15). They are recognized as moments when \*the speaker's living body orients itsef to the cognitive and social landscape at hand as an acting body", supporting a given practce which reveals how the speaker at that moment and with his or her audience \*makes sense in the manners in which acting in the material world makes sense (Streeck, 2017, p. 295). What teeck here calls the cognitive and social landscape is akin to Goodwin's (2018) 'embodied participation framework' or ecology: person-environment relations characterized by bodies (in the plural), language, gestures, and artefacts (like slides) being in dynamic interaction and, moreover, being adaptive to and constitutive of the evolving situation.

Fig. 23. Extract from peer-evaluation grid concerning modes (Morell et al., 2008, p. 565, p. 565).

With the work by Streeck, by Goodwin, and by other multimodality scholars of various stripes in mind (cf. Prior, 2012; Hafner & Miller, 2018, Ch. 7), could it not be said that to approach the spoken oral presentation with an evaluation grid in which different 'modes' are split up is to processis harmonious ecology through a kind of ontological egg slice? The subsequent identification, description, and teaching of the speech-gesture-slide interplay with the formula \*spoken $^ +$ image $^ +$ body" would suggest so (Morell et al., 2008, p. 562). Though undoubtedly offering a useful heuristic, the formula $( + \ldots + \ldots + \ldots )$ or similar conjunctive framings seems much les well-equipped bothfor handing the concrete, continuous, and evolving interplay of peron-environment relations in a practice like 'showing' and for appreciating the stage work of skilled practitioners like Brian Cox.

The notion of silld practice might offer a good starting point for developing classoom activitie informed by showing as sensemaking. \*The silled practitioner', writes anthropologist Ingold (2011), \*is one who can continuall attune his or her movements to perturbations in the perceived environment without ever interrupting the flow of action (p. 94). Continuous attunement, movement, perturbations, pereption, and flow are useful notions here. A new slide, for instance, is perturbation in the perceived environment to Which the presenter (and audience) must aune or risk interrupting the flow of presentation. This risk is borne out by students standing in the way of their beamer or waffling afore their slides, to revert t real scenarios with which I opened the paper. As a warmer activity to a lesson on the speech-gesture-slide interplay, a clas of EAP students could be shown these comical scenarios or asked to act them out. Rather than initiating students to the study of multimodality, I would then initiate them to a practice like showing by engaging them with some concrete examples such as from Brian Cox (worked examples could also be adapted from Morton, 2006; Knoblauch, 2008; Masi, 2020; Harrison, in preparation). Practitioners choice of examples might also take into account the disciplinary background and likely audience of their students' presentations (Tardy, 2005).

In teaching skilled practice as Van den Herik and Rietveld (2021) remind us, "active attunement does not rely on the transmission of (embodied) knowledge from teacher to novice, but rather consists in a teacher setting up the conditions that enable a novice to notice and respond to what isrelevant in a situation' (p. 5; se also Ingold, 2001, p. 141). The situation of interest for the class described here is the tak of showing visuals to an audience. Some pre-conditions might involve students choosing their visuals and exploring--with highly gestural examples like those from Cox fresh in thir mind--what potentialities to be animated, disclosed, or decomposed their own visuals invite or affrd'. To stimulate this'education of attention (Ingold, 2001), some questions for students at this stage - guided not only by notions of multimodality but also by theories of sense-making - might include: What mattrs to you about this visual or what draws you to it? What do you want the audience to notice about it? What explanation does it failiate? etter still, because \*roblem-solving is inseparable from the actual movements of the person-acting in the settings of practice (Ingold 2001, p. 145), an oral presentation setting could be simulated in the clasroom for students to discover answers to such questions through exploratory and improvisatory practice.

With analyses of the speech-gesture-slide interplay in presentations by an award-winning science communicator, this paper contributes to understanding the practice of 'showing as an environmentally-situated, embodied, enlanguaged, and socially implicative presentation skill (treck, 2017). It provides empirical support and sugsts materials for a class n oral preentations, which, rather than (or in adition to) explicitly raising stdents awarenessof different modes and their combinations, sees to sensitivise and engage students more directly and implicitly with the ecology of oral presentations. Whether or not this approach leads students to deeper understanding and/or stronger presentations, as well s what implications it holds for assessment, are subjects for future research.
