This study explores the difference in syntactic complexity between lay summaries (LSs) and scientific abstracts holistically and across their common rhetorical moves. Twenty-three syntactic complexity indices were employed to analyze a corpus of LSs and their counterpart abstracts from The New England Journal of Medicine. The analyses revealed that the LSs employed significantly shorter production units, more subordinate structures, more verb phrases, but fewer coordinate phrases and fewer complex nominals. Notably, the number of specific noun modifiers within complex nominals did not differ significantly between the two groups, indicating a comparable level of nominal sophistication. Moreover, we observed significant differences in the syntactic complexity of sentences realizing the common rhetorical moves across the two genres. Specif ically, sentences introducing background and presenting results were syntactically simpler in the LSs, whereas the syntactic complexity of sentences summarizing methods and drawing conclu sions remains largely consistent across both groups. The study contributes to a deeper under standing of the linguistic features of LSs and offers useful implications for LS writing practice.

# 1. Introduction

It has been acknowledged that we have entered an era of information explosion (e.g., Hyland, 2022). Readers have been facing the challenge of navigating through vast amounts of scientific information. Consequently, research summaries (RSs) serve as a crucial tool for scientific knowledge searching and communication by allowing readers to survey the contents of research outputs efficiently. In broad terms, any synopses that distill the key contents of research articles (RAs) can be regarded as RSs. Conventional RA abstracts are the most common RSs in the research world. In recent years, a new type of RS, lay summaries (LSs), has been innovated to promote the accessibility and dissemination of scientific research outputs (Dub´e & Lapane, 2014; Breeze, 2016).

LSs and abstracts, both as RSs, are similar in communicative purpose, but different in language style due to their different intended readerships. As a part-genre of RAs, traditional scientific abstracts are typically crafted in an academic style for members of a disciplinary community (Swales & Feak, 2009), while LRs are composed in plain language for lay audiences (Falkenberg et al., 2024; Kuehne & Olden, 2015). It has been extensively observed that lexico-grammatical features characteristic of specific registers and genres are influenced by situational factors such as communication mode, communicative purpose, topic, and participants (e.g., writers and readers for written registers) (Biber, 2012, 2019; Biber & Conrad, 2019). Against this backdrop, a comparative analysis of the linguistic differences between LSs and their counterpart abstracts could shed light on how scholars adapt their linguistic choices to summarize and communicate the same research for different readerships and how they optimize the functionality of LSs, i.e., communicating scientific knowledge with the general public. Our understanding of such differences remain limited, as this line of research is still emerging (e.g., Breeze, 2016; Liu & Li, 2024). Furthermore, it has been suggested that illustrating linguistic realizations of rhetorical moves can promote novice writers’ genre knowledge and thus improve their academic writing skills (e.g., Casal & Lu, 2021; Chen & Flowerdew, 2018; Dong & Lu, 2020). Despite such pedagogical value, scant attention has been paid to the formal features of rhetorical moves in LSs.

Situated in these gaps, this study aims to compare LRs and RA abstracts regarding syntactic complexity, a multidimensional construct that gauge diverse categories of syntactic structures (Lu, 2010; Norris & Ortega, 2009). Employing a corpus of 158 LRs and their counterpart abstracts from The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), we first examined whether syntactic complexity varies significantly between the LSs and the abstracts and then assessed variation of the syntactic complexity of common rhetorical moves found in the two groups. Through these analyses, we seek to deepen our understanding of the syntactic characteristics of the emerging genre, LSs, and provide pedagogically useful insights into LS writing practice.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Research on LSs

LSs are also known as open accessible summaries (Alferink & Marsden, 2023), author summaries (Breeze, 2016), or plain language summaries (Liu & Li, 2024). Currently, more and more journals across various disciplines have begun to adopt LSs (Breeze, 2016; Liu & Li, 2024), echoing the plea for communicating science with a broader public (Puschmann, 2014).

Some researchers have investigated readers’ preferences for LSs. For instance, Silvagnoli et al. (2022) provided readers with four LSs that were crafted for three medical articles. One was an infographic and three were text-only summaries with varying degrees of linguistic complexity. They found that the readers preferred the written summary of medium complexity and the infographic. Simi larly, Buljan et al. (2018) also reported readers’ preference for infographics over purely textual LSs. These studies indicate a need to pay more attention to LSs with visuals. However, there is little published data on such LSs.

The most popular line of inquiry into LSs concentrates on readability, which can be generally defined as the ease with which readers can read a text (Klare, 1963). The focus on readability is unsurprising in view of the crucial role of LSs in bridging the gap between science and the lay public. This line of research tends to employ traditional readability formulas to compare the readability of LSs and abstracts. Most previous studies found that LSs exhibit higher readability than abstracts (Anderson et al., 2022; Stricker et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2023; Yi & Yang, 2023). Meanwhile, it has also been indicated that LSs are still challenging to read for the general public (Shiely & Daly, 2023; Wen et al., 2023; Yi & Yang, 2023). Unfortunately, the suggestions offered in these studies to improve LS readability are rather limited because they are mainly based on the authors’ writing experience, thus lacking systematic textual evidence. An awareness of the nuanced linguistic distinctions between the two genres could yield more effective writing suggestions to enhance LS readability. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate the linguistic features between the two functionally similar genres.

To date, however, there has been limited research on the linguistic differences between LSs and abstracts. Breeze (2016) initially compared author summaries and their counterpart abstracts selected from the Public Library of Science in terms of several linguistic features such as active verbs, sentence length, word type-token ratio, percentage of 1000 most frequent words in English, and first-person pronouns (we and our). Her findings revealed that the author summaries employed more active verbs, shorter sentences, a greater diversity of words, more high-frequency words, and an increased occurrence of first-person pronouns. She concluded that it was still uncertain how author summaries should be written, highlighting further work on this aspect. More recently, Liu and Li (2024) compared the syntactic complexity differences between LSs and abstracts published in a marine science journal. Their findings demonstrated that LSs were characterized by more nominal subjects, more subordinate clauses, shorter production units, and fewer complexity nominals, indicating LS authors’ efforts to enhance accessibility and readability. By employing a wide array of syntactic complexity measures, their study unveiled more detailed inter-genre syntactic differences between the two genres and provided more constructive LS writing guidelines. Considering the disciplinary variation in academic writing (Casal et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021), further research on LSs from other disciplines is necessary to validate their findings. On top of that, Liu and Li did not take rhetorical moves into account. As a result, their findings fail to reveal a comprehensive picture of the linguistic differences between the two genres. The section below discusses the reasons for comparing LSs and abstracts across their common rhetorical moves.

# 2.2. Linguistic realizations of rhetorical moves in academic writing

A rhetorical move, comprising one or multiple steps, is defined as “a discoursal or rhetorical unit that performs a coherent communicative function in a written or spoken discourse” (Swales, 2004, p. 228). Numerous studies have investigated the linguistic features used to accomplish different rhetorical moves in RA part-genres (e.g., Casal et al., 2021; Cortes, 2013; Le & Harrington, 2015; Omidian et al., 2018). This line of inquiry illuminates how experts dynamically alter their language choices to achieve diverse communicative functions. It has been indicated that such insights are pedagogically valuable for novice writers (e.g., Casal & Lu, 2021;

Chen & Flowerdew, 2018; Dong & Lu, 2020). Casal and Lu (2021) reported that more functionally affordance-based text-analysis activities that prompted learners to reflect on the syntactic complexity of sentences realizing specific rhetorical move-steps could help learners “make more principled, audience-oriented decisions” (p.111) on the use of syntactically complex sentences in academic writing. However, there have been few empirical investigations into the linguistic realizations of rhetorical moves in LSs.

Although the rhetorical moves in abstracts have been extensively documented (e.g., Hyland, 2004; Swales & Feak, 2009), there is limited published data on those in LSs. Given that all types of RSs aim to distill essential information from RAs, it is reasonable to presume that they share some common rhetorical moves. Therefore, the rhetorical moves in abstracts, that is, Introduction, Purpose, Method, Product, and Conclusion in Hyland’s (2004) terminology, are likely found in LSs as well.

The linguistic realizations of the same rhetorical move may vary across different disciplines or genres. For example, Lu et al. (2021) investigated the syntactic complexity of sentences realizing six common rhetorical move-steps in RA introductions across four social science and engineering disciplines. They found that the same rhetorical move-step exhibited disciplinary variation in terms of syn tactic features. In light of the distinct target readership between LSs and abstracts, it is assumed that the rhetorical moves common to both genres would exhibit different linguistic characteristics.

Recognizing the pedagogical usefulness of insights into the linguistic realizations of rhetorical moves, the current study seeks to explore the inter-genre differences in the linguistic realizations of common rhetorical moves in LSs and their counterpart abstracts. Such an inter-genre comparison can inform us how scholars adjust their linguistic choices to realize the same communicative functions for different readers, i.e., experts and laymen.

# 2.3. Syntactic complexity, readability and knowledge dissemination

Syntactic complexity refers to the variation, elaboration, and sophistication of the syntactic structures in a text (Norris & Ortega, 2009). Traditionally, syntactic complexity is operationalized using holistic indices of different dimensions including global complexity (e.g., mean length of sentence), subordination (e.g., dependent clauses per clause), coordination (e.g., T-units per sentence), and phrasal complexity (e.g., complex nominals per clause) (Lu, 2010). To identify the specific structures contributing to complexity, recent research has begun to employ fine-grained indices that gauge specific structural types of clauses (e.g., nominal subjects per clause) and phrases (Nouns as a nominal dependent per nominal) (Kyle & Crossley, 2018).

Syntactic complexity indices have been increasingly employed to assess readability or text difficulty over the past decades, despite the widespread use of readability formulas (Crossley et al., 2019, 2023; Eslami, 2014; Pitler & Nenkova, 2008; Vajjala & Meurers, 2012; Zhang & Lu, 2024). This line of research not only proves the usefulness of syntactic complexity indices to evaluate readability but also informs us what syntactic features are related to comprehension difficulty. One driving factor for such studies is the increasing criticism of the simplistic nature of the linguistic difficulty measures that readability formulas subsume (Benjamin, 2012; Crossley et al., 2019, 2023). For instance, the widely used Flesch Reading Ease Score only considers the number of polysyllabic words and sentence length in a text (Flesch, 1948).

With regard to knowledge dissemination, previous findings have indicated that the syntactic complexity of RAs or their abstracts could influence their scientific or social impact. Chen et al. (2024) identified a positive association between the syntactic complexity of RAs and their social impact. More specifically, Lu et al. (2019) reported that RAs with higher scientific impact featured longer sen tences and clauses. Jin et al. (2021) explored the relationship between the social impact of RAs and the syntactic complexity of their abstracts. They observed that the social impact of RAs was positively correlated with the number of complex nominals but negatively with the number of verb phrases in their abstracts.

Considering the prior research findings, an investigation into the syntactic complexity of LSs is needed to unpack in what ways their readability can be further improved and their dissemination can be promoted.

# 2.4. The present study

In light of the gaps and research background discussed above, the current study explores the differences in syntactic complexity between LSs and their counterpart abstracts published in NEJM. Specifically, we aim to address the following research questions:

1. Are there significant differences in syntactic complexity between the LSs and their counterpart abstracts? If so, what are they?   
2. How do the LSs differ from their counterpart abstracts in syntactic complexity across the common rhetorical moves they employ?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. The corpus

Our data were sourced from The New England Journal of Medicine, a top-tier journal renowned for publishing cutting-edge, highquality research in clinical medicine. We chose NEJM as the focal journal for several reasons. First, LSs in medical journals are particularly worth researching. Access to clear and comprehensible health information can not only reduce patients’ uncertainty but also encourage them to actively participate in medical decision-making (Nunn & Pinfield, 2014). Furthermore, effective communication of health information with patients enables them to evaluate their conditions, collaborate with healthcare providers, and manage their health more proactively (Nunn & Pinfield, 2014). However, the general public often struggles with understanding the scientific and technical language commonly used in the medical literature (Edgell & Rosenberg, 2022; Marrie et al., 2013). Exploring the language of LSs in medical journals can offer critical insights for further enhancing their accessibility to the general public. Second, among medical journals with LSs, NEJM has been globally recognized for its authoritativeness and impact (NEJM Website, 2024), making it an appropriate starting point in understanding and improving the linguistic accessibility of LSs in the medical domain. Third, as mentioned above, readers favor LSs with visuals (Buljan et al., 2018; Silvagnoli et al., 2022). LSs published in NEJM are multi modally composed with written language and visual resources (see Appendix for an example), making them good candidates for our exploration of the overlooked role of graphics in LS writing.

While NEJM publishes various types of articles, LSs are only optionally provided with original articles. Hence, we browsed each original article published in 2022 and collected the texts of abstracts and LSs from the official website of NEJM (https://www.nejm. org/). Finally, 158 LSs and their counterpart abstracts were assembled to compile the corpus.

Before analysis, we cleaned the data to remove any potential noise. The NEJM abstracts are structured with headings, namely Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions. Since these headings serve as textual organizers and contribute minimally to absolute linguistic complexity (Bult´e & Housen, 2014), we omitted them. Similarly, headings in the NEJM LSs were excluded for the same reason. In addition, research funding information embedded within the Conclusions section in the abstracts was removed because it is extraneous to the core research content and not consistently present in all the abstracts. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the final dataset.

# 3.2. Syntactic complexity analysis

We adopted 23 syntactic complexity indices in total, of which 14 are traditional indices (see Table 2) and 9 are fine-grained phrasal indices (see Table 3). The traditional indices are those encompassed in the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA; Lu, 2010), which has been widely employed in syntactic complexity research. The L2SCA indices have been shown to be informative for revealing the linguistic characteristics of academic discourse (e.g., Casal et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Nasseri, 2021; Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021). Meanwhile, due to their highly holistic nature, they do not allow for detailed description of the specific linguistic structures used (Biber et al., 2020, 2024).

As can be seen from Table 2, each L2SCA measure reflects one of the five dimensions, length of production unit, overall sentence complexity, amount of subordination, amount of coordination, and degree of phrasal complexity. Lu (2010) reported F-scores of 0.83 or higher for the various types of structural units identified (e.g., sentences and clauses) and correlations of 0.834 or higher between the human- and L2SCA-calculated indices on essays produced by Chinese learners of English. In addition, Yoon and Polio (2017) reported correlations of 0.81 or higher between the scores of 11 human- and L2SCA-computed indices (and 0.74 for a 12th index) on essays by adult English as second language learners. Thereby, L2SCA is expected to achieve a higher level of reliability on the texts in our dataset than on the learner texts used in these evaluations, as LSs are composed by experts and contain no errors that may exist in learner writing data.

The dense use of complex noun phrases has been shown to be a distinctive discoursal feature of academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2010; 2016; Biber et al., 2011). As such, researchers have called for more attention to noun phrase complexity in academic discourse analysis. Based on this insight, we used a set of fine-grained phrasal complexity indices from the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAASSC; Kyle, 2016) to gauge noun phrase complexity. As shown in Table 3, these indices calculate the number of specific types of dependents (e.g., determiners and adjectival modifiers) per nominal. Following Kyle and Crossley (2018), pronouns were excluded from nominals because they cause potential distortions in counting dependents.

In summary, the traditional and fine-grained measures usefully complement each other: the former provides information about higher-level variation in syntactic complexity between the two genres, whereas the latter provide information about variation in the use of specific structures (i.e., noun modifiers in complex nominals). We used TAASSC to calculate all 23 syntactic complexity measures, as it offers a re-implementation of the 14 L2SCA measures (Kyle, 2016).

# 3.3. Identification of rhetorical moves

To address our second research question, each abstract and LS should be divided according to their common rhetorical moves. As previously mentioned, the NEJM abstracts consist of four sections with headings (i.e., Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusion). As the headings indicate, the four sections correspond to four rhetorical moves in RA abstracts proposed by Hyland (2004) (See Table 4). The identification of rhetorical moves in the abstracts was, therefore, based on these headings.

The NEJM LSs are composed of five sections with headings (i.e., Clinical problem, Clinical trial, Results, Limitations and remaining questions, and Conclusions). Upon examination of the contents of each section, we discovered that the Clinical problem section fulfills the rhetorical function of the Introduction move; the Clinical trial section embodies the rhetorical function of the Method move; the Results section corresponds to the Product move; the Conclusions section aligns with the Conclusion move.

As a result, there are four common rhetorical moves in the abstracts and the LSs from NEJM, with an additional move in the LSs that outlines limitations and suggestions. Hence, the additional move was not considered when comparing the two groups across rhetorical moves.

# 3.4. Statistical analysis

An LS and its counterpart abstract are paired samples, as they are based on the same RA. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was first employed to test the normality of the residual values of the differences between the LSs and the abstracts. The results revealed that none of the variables meet the normal distribution assumption of the paired-sample t-test. Therefore, employing R, we conducted a series of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, which serve as non-parametric counterparts to paired-sample t-tests (Pallant, 2020). As a total of 23 tests were performed in the study, the alpha value was adjusted to 0.002 (i.e., 0.05/23) by Bonferroni correction. Effect size, $r ,$ was calculated by dividing the $\mathfrak { z }$ value by the square root of $N$ ; the thresholds for small, medium, and large effect sizes are 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 respectively (Pallant, 2020).

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Research question 1

Our first research question asks how the LSs differ from their corresponding abstracts in terms of syntactic complexity. Table 5 presents the results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and the descriptive statistics for each measure. Twelve traditional measures showed significant between-group differences. Among these indices, one index (MLC) exhibited a large effect size, four (MLT, C/S, CT/ T, CN/C) showed medium effect sizes, and seven (MLS, C/T, DC/C, DC/T, CP/C, CN/T, VP/T) demonstrated small effect sizes. The results indicated that the LSs employed significantly shorter production units (MLS, MLT, MLT), fewer coordinate phrases per clause (CP/C), and fewer complex nominals (CN/T, CN/C), but more clauses (C/S, C/T), more complex T-units per T-unit (CT/T), more dependent clauses (DC/C, DC/T), and more verb phrases (VP/T).

Three fine-grained indices exhibited significant between-group differences, two with medium effect sizes (Det/N, Adj/N) and one with a small effect size (Poss/N). It should be noted that there was no significant between-group difference in Dep/N (Mdnabstract $=$ 1.66, MdnLS $= 1 . 6 4$ , $\mathbf { z } = - 0 . 6 1$ , $\mathtt { p } = 0 . 5 4 1$ , $\mathbf { r } = - 0 . 0 3 )$ , indicating that the number of noun modifiers per nominal remains consistent across the two groups. In addition, possessives rarely occur in the dataset, so the significant difference in Poss/N becomes tentative. Possessives thus are excluded from further discussion. The results suggested that the LSs employed significantly more adjectival modifiers (Adj/N) but significantly fewer determiners per nominal (Det/N).

# 4.2. Research question 2

Our second research question seeks to uncover the syntactic complexity differences between the LSs and their counterpart abstracts across their common rhetorical moves. As mentioned earlier, four rhetorical moves were identified in both the LSs and abstracts. The results for each move are presented below.

For the Introduction move, five indices showed significant inter-genre differences, all with small effect sizes (see Table 6). Results for the traditional indices showed that the LSs employed significantly shorter T-units (MLT) and fewer complex nominals per T-unit (CN/T), but utilized more coordinate clauses (T/S). In terms of noun modifiers, the LSs favored simpler nominals in general with significantly fewer noun modifiers (Dep/N) and prepositions per nominal (Prep/N).

For the Method move, significant inter-genre differences were observed in four indices (See Table 7). With the exception of Det/N, which exhibited a medium effect size, all other indices demonstrated small effect sizes. Results for the traditional indices showed that the LSs contained significantly more coordinate phrases (CP/T, CP/C). As for specific noun modifiers, the LSs utilized significantly fewer determiners (Det/N) and verbal modifiers (Vmod/N) per nominal. However, it should be noted that the absolute frequency of verbal modifiers in both genres was very low.

Table 8). Effect sizes were large for two indices (MLS, MLT), medium for four (MLC, CN/T, CN/C, Adj/N), and small for the remaining six (C/S, DC/C, CP/T, CP/C, VP/T, RC/N). Results for the traditional measures indicated that the Product move in the LSs contained significantly shorter production units (MLS, MLT, MLC), fewer clauses (C/S), fewer dependent clauses (DC/C), fewer coordinate phrases (CP/T, CP/C), fewer complex nominals (CN/T, CN/C), and fewer verb phases (VP/T). In terms of specific noun modifiers, the LSs employed significantly more adjectival modifiers (Adj/N) and relative clauses per nominal (RC/N). However, it should be noted that the absolute frequency of relative clauses in both genres was very low.

For the Conclusions move, only MLS showed significant inter-genre differences (see Table 9). However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as the $p$ value of this measure just reached the alpha value of 0.002, and its effect size was small. Overall, our results indicated that the syntactic complexity of sentences realizing the Conclusion move was comparable between the two groups.

# 5.1. Syntactic complexity differences between LSs and abstracts

Our results revealed several significant differences in syntactic complexity between the LSs and their counterpart abstracts from NEJM. Regarding production units, our study found that the LSs had a significantly shorter mean length of sentence, clause, and T-unit than the abstracts. The findings are consistent with previous observations that LSs employ shorter sentences and T-units (Breeze, 2016; Liu & Li, 2024). Employing shorter production units suggests the authors’ adherence to the general writing guidance for LSs, which emphasizes the use of short sentences (Dub´e & Lapane, 2014; Gainey et al., 2023; Stoll et al., 2022). Additionally, the observation aligns with previous evidence that shorter production units contribute to improving readability or comprehensibility (Eslami, 2014; Vajjala & Meurers, 2012; Zhang & Lu, 2024).

Concerning subordination, the results indicated that the LSs employed significantly more clauses per T-unit, complex T-units per Tunit, and dependent clauses per clause and per T-unit, suggesting a higher degree of subordination in the LSs. This finding is consistent with Liu and Li (2024), who also observed a significantly higher frequency of subordinate clauses in LSs from a marine science journal. In general, the denser use of subordinate clauses in a text improves its readability (Pitler & Nenkova, 2008; Vajjala & Meurers, 2012), as they make meaning relationships more explicit than compressed phrasal expressions (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2016). In this sense, the greater use of dependent clauses in the LSs likely reflects an effort to improve comprehensibility. This finding also showed that the writing style of the LSs differed from that of traditional academic prose, as subordinate clauses have been found to be more prevalent in spoken registers than in written ones (Biber & Gray, 2010; 2016; Biber et al., 2011). Meanwhile, LS writers should be cautious about overusing complex T-units, which may also result in higher text difficulty (Crossley et al., 2019; Zhang & Lu, 2024; Zhang & Lu, 2024).

In terms of coordination, the LSs used significantly fewer coordinate phrases per clause. Lower usage of coordinate phrases could help improve enhance readability in two ways. First, such phrases condense information that may be conveyed in multiple clauses (Biber & Gray, 2010; Wu et al., 2020), and reducing the use of such phrases could help reduce information overload and make the content easier to grasp. Second, modified coordinate phrases could also be ambiguous (Biber et al., 1999), and the determination of modification scope may entail contextual or specialized knowledge from the readers. Reducing the frequency of such coordinate phrases in the LSs can thus help minimize ambiguities and enhance accurate comprehension of the information presented.

As regards phrasal complexity, the LSs adopted significantly more verb phrases but fewer complex nominals. This outcome con trasts with Liu and Li’s (2024) finding, which reported no significant between-group difference in VP/T. This discrepancy may be attributed to disciplinary variations; the current study focused on the LSs in clinical medicine, whereas Liu and Li examined LSs in marine science. Additionally, differences in format between abstracts and LSs may also explain this inconsistency. Both LSs and ab stracts in Liu and Li’s study are verbal, but the LSs in the current study are multimodal texts whereas the abstracts are purely verbal.

The phrasal features observed in the LSs suggested the authors’ effort to improve readability and comprehensibility. The increased use of verb phrases and decreased use of complex nominals correlate positively with readability (Pitler & Nenkova, 2008; Crossley et al., 2023). Additionally, reducing the frequency of complex nominals aids in improving text comprehensibility and processing (Zhang & Lu, 2024), since compressed phrasal structures are challenging to construe due to the loss of specification and explicitness in meaning relationships among component words (Biber & Gray, 2010; 2016; Wu et al., 2020). Moreover, such phrasal features indicated that the writing style of the LSs diverged from traditional academic writing as academic prose typically rely on the heavy use of nouns, whereas the dense use of verbs is a common characteristic of spoken registers (Biber & Gray, 2016).

More strikingly, the phrasal style in the LSs, characterized by fewer nominal phrases but more verbal phrases, could potentially undermine the social impact of their source RAs. According to Jin et al. (2021), RAs with higher social impact tended to contain more complex nominal phrases but fewer verb phrases in their abstracts. Nevertheless, we argue that this may not apply to LSs. Jin et al. (2021) claimed that an abstract that was more of an academic style would make its source RA attract more online attention since the public relied on the linguistic style of abstracts to judge RA quality. This practice is not suitable for LSs, as they are required to be written in accessible language instead of academic language. Therefore, further work is needed to explore what linguistic features of LSs correlate with the social impact of their source RAs.

As for specific noun modifiers, our study found that the number of modifiers per nominal was comparable between the two groups. The observation indicated that despite a decrease in quantity, the sophistication of nominals in the LSs was not notably reduced. This may cause a certain degree of reading difficulty, as all types of phrasal modification can cause meaning inexplicitness (Biber & Gray, 2010; 2016; Wu et al., 2020). Furthermore, the LSs employed more adjectival modifiers but fewer determiners, contrasting Liu and Li’s (2024) observation that LSs adopted fewer adjective modifiers within noun phrases than abstracts. This contrast may have arisen from disciplinary variation and LS format differences. What’s more, it should be noted that fewer determiners but more adjectival modifiers per nominal could potentially pose text processing difficulty (Zhang & Lu, 2024).

Collectively, our findings suggest that LSs are generally more readable than abstracts (Anderson et al., 2022; Stricker et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2023; Yi & Yang, 2023), as they exhibit more syntactic features that enhance readability or facilitate text processing, such as dependent clauses and simple nominals. However, LS writers may need to pay attention to the density of complex T-units and nominals with adjectival modifiers, which could potentially cause reading difficulties. Furthermore, consistent with the findings of Liu and Li (2024), our study suggested that LSs tend to display a less academic writing style and adopt a more conversational tone, marked by a relatively higher frequency of dependent clauses and verb phrases.

5.2. Syntactic complexity differences between LSs and abstracts across rhetorical moves

Our results revealed significant variation in the syntactic complexity of sentences realizing the four common rhetorical moves found in the LSs and their counterpart abstracts.

# 5.2.1. The introduction move

Our results suggested that the language realizing the Introduction move in the LSs was relatively syntactically simpler than that in their counterpart abstracts, as evidenced by the use of shorter T-units, more coordinate clauses, fewer complex nominals, and simpler nominals. A possible explanation is that the Introduction move is generally achieved with more words in the LSs $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 4 5 . 7 7 )$ than in the abstracts $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 3 7 . 6 7 )$ . When composing abstracts, scholars prioritize the Product move, often leading to the other moves being expressed with fewer words or even omitted due to word limitation (Hyland, 2004). The Product move in the LSs is realized with notably fewer words (discussed in detail below), allowing more words to accomplish the Introduction move. Longer sentences with more complex nominals contribute to information condensation (Biber & Gray, 2010; 2016; Wu et al., 2020), which may explain why the Introduction move in the abstracts was often achieved through such structures.

Examples 1a and 1b are the Introduction moves from an abstract and its counterpart LS. Example 1a (24 words) is a structurally simple sentence but features a relatively long and complex nominal subject (underlined), whereas Example 1b (56 words) comprises three sentences with simpler noun phrases (underlined). The more elaborated sentence structure in Example 1b is easier to parse and understand, while also providing adequate background information for the lay audience. Thus, the linguistic features of the Introduction move in LSs imply the writers’ effort to use plain language.

Ex. 1a The possible advantage of hybrid closed-loop therapy (i.e., artificial pancreas) over sensor-augmented pump therapy in very young children with type 1 diabetes is unclear. (AB202201201)   
Ex. 1b Management of type 1 diabetes is challenging in very young children. Sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy has been associated with improvements in glycemic control, but the management burden remains high. Hybrid closed-loop systems, in which an algorithm automatically adjusts basal insulin delivery, have shown promise in older children and adolescents, but data in very young children are limited. (LS202201201)

# 5.2.2. The Method move

Our results showed that the Method move in the LSs featured more coordinate phrases but fewer determiners per nominal compared to that in the abstracts. This difference may be attributed to the varying levels of detail provided. The Method move in the abstracts is designed to describe how the study was conducted, focusing on providing a precise account of the research methodology for medical practitioners. In contrast, the Method move in the LSs is aimed at communicating clinical trial details to the general public. Consequently, more coordinate phrases were employed in the LSs to present additional or more comprehensive information about the clinical trials, thereby providing a clearer and more detailed overview of the treatment objectives and intervention methods for lay readers.

Examples 2a and 2b illustrate the Method moves from an abstract and its corresponding LS. Example 2a provides only a brief description of the research design, including two coordinate phrases (in bold and italic), without extensive detail. In contrast, Example 2b employs more coordinate phrases (in bold and italic) to introduce additional or specific information about various aspects of the intervention, such as the specific forms of treatment and a thorough description of the primary endpoint, thereby enhancing clarity for a non-specialist audience.

Ex. 2a In this prospective, investigator-led, open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of horse ATG plus cyclosporine with or without eltrombopag as front-line therapy in previously untreated patients with severe aplastic anemia. The primary end point was a hematologic complete response at 3 months. (AB202201061) Ex. 2b A phase 3, prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial examined the efficacy and safety of standard immunosuppressive therapy, either alone or with eltrombopag, as first-line treatment in patients with severe aplastic anemia. 197 untreated patients $_ { ( \ge 1 5 }$ years of age) with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia were assigned to receive intravenous horse ATG plus oral cyclosporine, with or without oral eltrombopag. The primary end point was hematologic complete response at 3 months, defined as a hemoglobin level ${ \bf > } { \bf } { \bf { 1 0 } }$ g per deciliter, an absolute neutrophil count ${ \bf > } 1 0 0 0$ per cubic millimeter, and a platelet count ${ } > 1 0 0 , 0 0 0$ per cubic millimeter in patients who had not received transfusions. (LS202201061)

# 5.2.3. The Product move

Our results revealed that sentences realizing the Product move in the LSs were generally syntactically simpler than those in the abstracts, as evidenced by the use of shorter production units, fewer coordinate clauses and phrases, fewer dependent clauses, and fewer nominal and verbal phrases. The LSs were found to use notably fewer words $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 6 2 . 4 8 )$ to realize the Product move compared to their counterpart abstracts $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 1 7 2 . 1 6 )$ ). This observation can be attributed to the fact that the Product move in the NEJM LSs is multimodally accomplished with data visuals in addition to language description. Different modes may “reinforce each other (‘say the same thing in different ways’), fulfill complementary roles” (Kress & Leeuwen, 2001, p. 20). Visuals, such as tables and graphs, provide substantial supporting and additional information alongside the written content, enabling readers to efficiently gain an overview of research results. The examination of our corpus revealed that tables and graphs were the most common types of visuals used to present results in the NEJM LSs.

Example 3a (128 words) is the Product move in an abstract, which reports the research results exclusively via written language. Whereas in its counterpart LS, the Product move is achieved not only through written language, as seen in Example 3b (only 42 words), but also through visuals presented in Fig. 1. As can be observed, a significant proportion of the information described in the abstracts, especially numerical information (underlined in Example 3a), is presented graphically in the LS.

Ex. 3a The mean changes in the Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score were − 17.0 points in the nonoperative group, $- 1 6 . 0$ points in the open-repair group, and − 14.7 points in the minimally invasive surgery group $( \mathbf { P } = 0 . 5 7 $ ). Pairwise comparisons provided no evidence of differences between the groups. The changes from baseline in physical performance and patient-reported physical function were similar in the three groups. The number of tendon reruptures was higher in the nonoperative group $\underline { { ( 6 . 2 \% ) } }$ than in the open-repair or minimally invasive surgery group $_ { \mathrm { ~ \it ~ 0 . 6 \% ~ } }$ in each). There were 9 nerve injuries in the minimally invasive surgery group (in $5 . 2 \%$ of the patients) as compared with 5 in the open-repair group (in $2 . 8 \%$ ) and 1 in the nonoperative group (in $0 . 6 \% )$ . (AB202204142)

Ex. 3b The mean ATRS changed to a similar extent in all three groups from baseline to month 12. The overall incidence of serious adverse events was similar among the groups. Tendon rerupture and nerve injuries were uncommon overall, although rerupture occurred more often with nonoperative treatment than with either surgical approach, whereas nerve injuries occurred more often with minimally invasive surgery than with nonoperative treatment. (LS202204142)

# 5.2.4. The conclusion move

Interestingly, our results revealed that the language used to fulfill the Conclusion move in the LSs and the abstracts was comparable in syntactic complexity, with the exception that the LSs tended to employ longer sentences. In both abstracts and LSs, authors are required to concisely summarize their research findings, conveying a comparable amount of information. Consequently, the syntactic complexity of the Conclusion move is likely to be similar in both genres, as illustrated by Examples 4a and 4b. However, there are instances where the conclusions in the LSs include more specific details, which may result in slightly longer sentences, as illustrated by Examples 5a and 5b.

Ex. 4a Four months of antituberculosis treatment was noninferior to 6 months of treatment in children with drug-susceptible, nonsevere, smear-negative tuberculosis. (AB202203101)   
Ex. 4b Among children with nonsevere, drug-susceptible, smear-negative TB, a 4-month treatment regimen was noninferior to a 6- month regimen at 72 weeks of follow-up. (LS202203101)   
Ex. 5a Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival than chemotherapy among patients with advanced endometrial cancer. (AB202202032)   
Ex. 5b Among women with advanced endometrial cancer and disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy, combi nation therapy with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than chemotherapy of the physician’s choice. (LS202202032)

To summarize, the inter-genre comparison of the common rhetorical moves in the two groups provides a deeper insight into linguistic differences between the LSs and their corresponding abstracts. Overall, the sentences used to achieve the Introduction move and the Product move in the LSs were relatively more straightforward than those in the abstracts. However, the overall syntactic complexity of the sentences achieving the Method and Conclusion moves did not vary significantly between the two groups, with the exception that the LSs tended to employ more coordinate phrases to present methods and slightly longer sentences to draw conclusions.

# 6. Conclusion and implications

This exploratory study compared the syntactic complexity of the LSs and their counterpart abstracts from NEJM. Our results indicated that the LSs generally adopted a greater number of syntactic features positively related to readability, while also employing those that potentially pose difficulty in comprehensibility. Our study confirmed the previous finding that LSs are generally more accessible and more readable compared to traditional scientific abstracts, though there is still room for further improvement in readability (Anderson et al., 2022; Stricker et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2023; Yi & Yang, 2023). In line with Liu and Li (2024), we also observed that LSs display a writing style deviating from academic discourse but akin to conversations. Additionally, we delved into the inter-genre differences in linguistic features across the common rhetorical moves in the two genres. Our findings revealed that sentences performing the same rhetorical move in the NEJM LSs and their corresponding abstracts exhibited different syntactic char acteristics. Specifically, our results indicated that the sentences used to realize the Introduction and Product moves were less syntactically complex in the LSs compared to those in the abstracts. However, the syntactic complexity of the sentences fulfilling the Method and Conclusion moves was largely comparable between the two genres.

Our findings have useful implications for LS writing practice. First, our study showed multiple syntactic features that comtribute to enhancing readability or promoting text processing are frequently used in the NEJM LSs, such as dependent clauses and simple nominals. Despite the effectiveness of these linguistic features for readability enhancement, they are often overlooked in most LS writing guidelines, which primarily emphasize the importance of short sentences and the avoidance of jargon (Dub´e & Lapane, 2014; Gainey et al., 2023; Stoll et al., 2022). Therefore, it could be advantageous to incorporate recommendations for the use of these grammatical structures in LS writing guidelines. Second, our findings suggested that sentences used for the Method and Conclusion moves in LSs may not be more accessible than those in the corresponding abstracts, at least in terms of syntactic complexity. Therefore, when writing LSs, careful attention should be paid to the grammatical structures in these two rhetorical moves to avoid the use of overly complex constructions, particularly compressed and sophisticated noun phrases. Drawing inspiration from Open Accessible Summaries in Language Studies (OASIS, Alferink & Marsden, 2023), it may be beneficial to use bullet points to outline each key aspect of research design with shorter, more straightforward sentences. For the Conclusion move, writers might consider breaking long sentences into several shorter ones, using simpler nominals, and incorporating more subordinate clauses. Additionally, our results emphasize the crucial role of infographics in presenting dense information about results. Currently, most LSs rely solely on written language (Stoll et al., 2022). Given readers’ preference for infographics over purely textual summaries (Buljan et al., 2018; Silvagnoli et al., 2022), other journal publishers could draw insights from NEJM by integrating visual elements into LSs to enhance their accessibility.

Our findings can also inform the instruction of LS writing and academic writing. On one hand, our analysis of the syntactic complexity differences between these two functionally similar genres can serve as a valuable teaching resource, helping novice writers understand the specific linguistic features of each genre. On the other hand, our findings highlight the importance of increasing novice writers’ awareness of adapting their linguistic choices to suit different communicative purposes and target audiences in academic writing.

There are several limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, we only used the traditional L2SCA measures to assess clausal syntactic complexity. These measures combine various grammatical structures into single indices, potentially obscuring the use of specific structures (Biber et al., 2020, 2024). Future research would benefit from employing more fine-grained clausal measures, such as those from TAASSC (Kyle, 2016), to provide a more nuanced and detailed analysis of the syntactic differences between LSs and abstracts. Second, considering the disciplinary variation in academic writing (Casal et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021), it is important to conduct further research on LSs from journals in diverse fields to assess the generalizability of our findings. Third, our study focused solely on syntactic complexity. Future research could expand the analytical scope to include other linguistic features that affect readability, such as lexical complexity and cohesive devices (Crossley et al., 2019, 2023).

# Nonoperative or Surgical Treatment of Acute Achilles' Tendon Rupture

Myhrvold SB et al.DOl:10.1056/NEJMoa2108447

# CLINICAL PROBLEM

Acute Achilles'tendon rupture can be treated with open repair, minimally invasive surgery, or nonoperative therapies, but whether surgical approaches confer better outcomes than nonoperative treatment is uncertain.

# CLINICAL TRIAL

Design:A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial compared nonoperative treatment, open repair, and minimally invasive surgery in adults with acute Achilles' tendon rupture.

Intervention:A total of 554 patients who were 18 to 60 years of age and had no previous Achilles'tendon rupture were randomly assigned to one of the three approaches.The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the patient-reported Achilles' tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) at 12 months; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status on the basis of symptoms and physical limitations).

# RESULTS

Efficacy:The mean ATRS changed to a similar ex tent in all three groups from baseline to month 12.

Safety:The overall incidence of serious adverse events was similar among the groups.Tendon rerupture and nerve injuries were uncommon overall, although rerupture occurred more often with nonoperative treatment than with either surgical approach, whereas nerve injuries occurred more often with minimally invasive surgery than with nonoperative treatment

# LIMITATIONS AND REMAINING QUESTIONS

For feasibility reasonspatients physicians and rehabilitation physiotherapists were all aware of treatment allocations.   
Baseline health status was assessed retrospectively after patients underwent casting but before randomization.
