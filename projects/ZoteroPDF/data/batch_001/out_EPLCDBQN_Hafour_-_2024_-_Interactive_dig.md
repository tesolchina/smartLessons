# ABSTRACT

Owing to the plethora of user-friendly audio/video creation and editing applications as well as free full-featured hosting platforms, videoing and sharing has become a lifestyle of today’s students. Utilizing these spontaneous practices, the current study examined the effects of digital media assignments (DMAs) and accompanying asynchronous interaction on EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners’ oral language skills. For this purpose, a cohort of 124 EFL college students was randomly selected and assigned into three groups: interactive digital media assignments (IDMA, $n = 4 3$ ), non-interactive digital media assignments (NDMA, $n = 4 1$ ), and traditional face-to-face assignments (FTFA, $\scriptstyle n = 4 0$ ). The study adopted the mixed-method sequential explanatory design wherein quantitative data collection and analysis (oral language skills pre-posttests) was followed by qualitative data collection and analysis (perceptions survey). Quantitative findings revealed that participants in all groups showed improvements in both overall and micro-level oral language skills (i.e. oral content, fluency, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar). However, IDMA students outperformed both NDMA and FTFA ones. Comparing NDMA and FTFA groups, the former performed better than the latter only in content and vocabulary, whereas it could not in fluency, pronunciation, grammar, or overall oral language skills. Thus, it can be inferred that DMAs alone helped improve only content elaboration and vocabulary. However, when done interactively, they could bolster students’ overall as well as all micro-level oral language skills when compared to face-toface assignments. Besides, despite describing digital media production as exhausting and time-consuming, IDMA students reported increased self-confidence, technical literacy, and language competence and decreased speaking apprehension.

# 1.  Introduction

Speaking is considered the most time-consuming and labor-intensive skill to develop and assess. That is, much time and effort are needed to design, practice, monitor, provide feedback on, and assess oral tasks. This is the case in regular non-pandemic educational conditions, let alone pandemic ones. Therefore, online alternatives are a good option to complement and make up for insufficient time and inadequate speaking practice in face-to-face settings.

State-of-the-art technologies used and examined in English as a Foreign or Second Language research on oral performance are manifold: (a) self-created video projects/digital video recording (Bobkina & Domínguez Romero, 2020; Dzakiah, Assiddiq, & Mustari, 2020; Göktürk, 2016; Hidayati, 2020; Rajulain, 2020; Riyanto, 2020; Spring, 2020; Sumardi & Wijaya, 2020); (b) voice/video blogging (Davies, 2015; Hsu, 2016; Madzlan, Seng, & Kesevan, 2020); (c) videoconferencing (Tecedor & Campos-Dintrans, 2019); (d) podcasting (Díez & Richters, 2020; Grisales & García, 2017; Wulan, 2018); (e) VoiceThread (Dugartsyrenova & Sardegna, 2017; Ebadi & Asakereh, 2018); (f ) digital storytelling/news stories (Hwang et  al., 2016; Kim, 2014; Lee, 2014; Yang, Chen, & Hung, 2020); (g) (mobile-based/ video-based) virtual reality (Chien, Hwang, & Jong, 2020; Ebadi & Ebadijalal, 2020; Xie et al., 2021); and (h) virtual exchanges (Canals, 2020).

Today’s students are captivated with videoing and sharing their spontaneous daily experiences on social media websites (welcoming feedback and comments). This has become, in Juana and Palak (2011) terms, a lifestyle of today’s millennial generation. A number of factors have augmented these practices: First, free hosting services as well as extensive sharing and commenting potentials that social media offer. Second, the abundance of freely available and easy-to-use audio/video recording and editing software in addition to low-cost and high-tech hardware. Surveyed on whether they previously experienced video creation and/or editing, 219 (out of 273) EFL college students reported that they did. Accordingly, especially within the current pandemic conditions where the face-to-face oral practice is not safe or even practical, an urgent question is posed: Why is this spontaneous tendency, to create and share digital media followed by making/receiving digital comments, not utilized to enhance students’ EFL oral language skills?

The current study, henceforth, was conducted in an attempt to take advantage of students’ unprompted practice of videoing and sharing their self-generated content online. To put it differently, the current study examined the impact of student-generated digital media assignments and accompanying asynchronous interaction activities on EFL learners’ oral language skills. In this vein, students practiced: (a)

interaction on digital media (giving and receiving feedback on the content and form of the DMA) and (b) interaction through digital media (using audio/video recordings as modes of feedback delivery). Besides, the study explored the participants’ perceptions of the activities practiced. The main research questions were:

1. Do EFL learners’ overall and micro-level oral language skills evolve after doing interactive digital media, non-interactive digital media, and face-to-face assignments?   
2. Of the three assignments (interactive digital media, non-interactive digital media, and face-to-face), which one has a more significant effect on EFL learners’ overall and micro-level oral language skills?   
3. How are interactive digital media assignments perceived by learners?

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Digital Interaction and social constructivism

Digital interaction is grounded in Vygotsky’s social constructivist language learning paradigm. According to Vygotsky, learning is considered a social act. Therefore, for learning to take place, learners should practice social interaction within a community of learners and teachers to share and acquire knowledge or experience (Foote, 2009). As such, Vygotsky highlights that meaningful social interaction is necessary for learning a foreign language whereby learners co-construct their knowledge with their peers first then individually (Hauck & Youngs, 2008).

According to this theory, learning occurs in interactive dialogues in which learners, with their peers’ assistance, can bridge the ‘zone of proximal development’ (ZPD). It refers to the gap between the developmental level that students can attain independently and that which they can reach with guidance (Kitade, 2008). On that account, constructivists propose that the key to effective instruction then should be a pedagogy that places learners in direct interaction with and through information rather than simply transmitting it to them (Minocha & Thomas, 2007). This involves assigning tasks where learners interact with each other while doing the task in addition to providing them with opportunities to actively gather, organize, and collaboratively synthesize such information transforming it into new cognitive structures (Fung, 2004).

With respect to technology and speaking activities, digital and online tools are deemed to be either interactive or non-interactive. On the one hand, tutorial CALL (oral-drill and Automatic Speech Recognition) applications, though being beneficial in developing certain linguistic aspects, are criticized for lack of feedback or human-like interaction. On the other hand, interactive CMC tools, which emerged in response, are merited for offering a context where speakers can interact and get real-life human feedback (Blake, 2016). CMC tools provide for two types of interaction: synchronous (in real-time) and asynchronous (with a lag time).

Computer-mediated and online interaction not only offers a personalized but also an engaging and collaborative context where students create, share, and practice the target language together (Lee, 2014). Besides, it provides for authentic and meaningful social interaction (Yang, 2011); increased awareness of target language features (Ziegler, 2016); extended meaning negotiation (Canals, 2020; Yanguas, 2010; 2012; Ziegler, 2016); more equal opportunities to participate in discussions, less feeling of anxiety, and more self-confidence as compared to face‐ to‐face interaction (Bashori, van Hout, Strik, & Cucchiarini, 2020; Leahy, 2008; Sun, 2012). All of this can lead to enhancing student reflective ability (Chien et  al., 2020; Dooly & Sadler, 2016; Dugartsyrenova & Sardegna, 2017; Kim, 2014; Kirkgöz, 2011; Kitade, 2008; Lee, 2014), motivation, and critical thinking skills (Schenker, 2017) as well as higher levels of student interaction and participation (Schenker, 2017).

With the development of web 2.0, a myriad of synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) and asynchronous computer-mediated communication (ACMC) tools and applications have been in stock. Synchronous (real-time) CMC tools include audio/videoconferencing, web chat, and cloud-based applications, whereas asynchronous ones comprise podcasts, audio/video recording and posting tools (like VoiceThread, Youtube, Vimeo, Edpuzzle, and Flipgrid), emails, wikis, and blogs. According to Young and West (2018), although SCMC and ACMC are similar in some ways, the latter provides opportunities that the former (or even face-to-face speaking tasks) does not. Though SCMC has the advantage of preparing students for real-life communication (Gläsman, 2004) and enabling them to hear and see their partners (Schenker, 2017), pressures of instant communication may lead to unsuccessful task completion, fewer opportunities for meaning negotiation (Van der Zwaard & Bannink, 2014), and less thoughtful and reflective responses (Schenker, 2017). This is in addition to many monitoring barriers, time and internet bandwidth constraints, and not to mention technical (software and hardware) problems.

These downsides of synchronous CMC have urged researchers to consider the asynchronous mode for a number of reasons: In addition to overcoming the aforementioned technical problems, ACMC provides time for thinking, planning, constructing, and reconstructing responses (Tecedor & Campos-Dintrans, 2019; Young & West, 2018). ACMC allows students to watch or listen to their own recordings and practice self-evaluation which boosts self-awareness of the deficient areas (Young & West, 2018). Thus, it yields more reflective students with thoughtful responses (Kitade, 2008). Eventually, it facilitates communication at each student’s convenience with respect to pace, place, and time. Since ACMC can provide more opportunities than SCMC, it was mainly used in the current study.

# 2.2.  Digital media assignments

Easy viewing and sharing of self-created videos help students see their own target language- speaking persona and get it seen by others (Foss et al., 2008). In fact, these unprompted digital practices are gaining growing interest by CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) researchers, especially with the existence of time-tested teaching/learning approaches like project-based language learning (PBLL), as claimed by Dooly and Sadler (2016). PBLL is a student-centered approach that is grounded in Vygotsky’s social constructivism as it enhances students’ communicative competence and social interaction skills (Spring, 2020). In this respect, the type of project task and how it is implemented is of great significance for successful PBLL (Foss et  al., 2008). One type of EFL project that has been claimed to be highly appropriate and useful for PBLL is video or short film production (Foss et  al., 2008; Miller & Hafner, 2014). Regardless of the content, the preparation and shooting process and then the collective viewing and discussion of the video provide a valuable context for student-centered task-based language learning (Godwin-Jones, 2012).

Student-generated DMAs, as evidenced by previous research, are beneficial for language learners in a number of ways: They solicit practicing multiple skills, starting with searching and organizing content, writing a script, merging voice, images, and video, publishing a final digital media product online, and ending with giving and receiving feedback on it (Lee, 2014; Sylvester & Greenidge, 2009). They also provide students with increased planning and rehearsal time (Dugartsyrenova & Sardegna, 2017; Grisales & García, 2017), thereby leading to improvements in fluency, complexity, and accuracy (Spring, 2020) and a decrease in pronunciation hesitation and grammatical mistakes (Chien et al., 2020).

Multiple viewing of the recording enhances students’ self- and peer-reflection and assessment (Dugartsyrenova & Sardegna, 2017; Kim, 2014; Kirkgöz, 2011) as well as self-monitoring and self-regulation (Grisales & García, 2017). Consequently, students can spot their weaknesses and trace their oral language improvements (Kirkgöz, 2011) which positively affect their language and self-confidence (Kim, 2014). Additionally, studies reported lower levels of students’ speaking anxiety (Grisales & García, 2017; Juana & Palak, 2011; Madzlan et  al., 2020) and higher levels of motivation, self-confidence, and self-esteem after practicing audio/video recording (Grisales & García, 2017; Kurwardani & Wahyuni, 2013). Further, they afford convenience and flexibility as to the place and time of practicing the target language (Juana & Palak, 2011) and help build varied 21st‐century skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and multi‐ literacies (Lee, 2014; Sylvester & Greenidge, 2009).

Previous research has provided multi-perspective empirical evidence on the effect of digital media production or audio/video recording on different language aspects: (a) oral proficiency (Bobkina & Domínguez Romero, 2020; Díez & Richters, 2020; Dzakiah et  al., 2020; Göktürk, 2016; Hidayati, 2020; Lee, 2014; Spring, 2020); (b) oral assessment (Rajulain, 2020; Sumardi & Wijaya, 2020); (c) speaking anxiety (Madzlan et  al., 2020; Sun, 2012); (d) listening (Hawke, 2010); (e) pronunciation (Ducate & Lomicka, 2009); (f) grammar (Istanto, 2011); (g) vocabulary acquisition (Putman & Kingsley, 2012); (h) motivation and self-confidence (Collins & Hunt, 2011; Kurwardani & Wahyuni, 2013; Miller & Hafner, 2014); (i) students’ perceptions and perspectives (Davies, 2015; Ducate & Lomicka, 2009; Lestari, 2019).

Although a number of studies have investigated the utilization of digital media projects (audio/video recordings) in speaking classes, most of them were conducted in ESL (English as a Second Language) contexts, where students possibly had a variety of other opportunities to practice speaking the target language. In addition, the majority of these studies focused only on one or more of the following: speaking assessment, anxiety, perceptions, motivation, learner attitudes, and/or self-confidence. Few studies, if any, have provided empirical evidence on the impact of practicing digital media production for content delivery and subsequent online interaction on EFL learner’s oral language skills.

# 3.  Method

# 3.1.  Study design

This study adopted a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design in which quantitative data collection and analysis were followed by qualitative data collection and analysis to explain and elaborate on the quantitative data (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). Figure 1 illustrates these procedures.

# 3.2.  Participants

Study eligibility criteria included the availability of a computer, laptop, or any mobile device with a constant internet connection; having previous (even if limited) experience with audio/video recording and/or editing; and acceptance and willingness to join the study. For this purpose, a pretask online survey (Appendix A) was administered to junior EFL college students $\scriptstyle \left( N = 2 7 3 \right)$ . Students were told that there were no consequences of not joining the study. Therefore, selected participants joined the study at their own discretion.

Figure 1. S tudy design and implementation procedures.

Subsequently, out of 199 students who met the criteria (and accepted to join the study), a cohort of 132 students (using online sample size calculators, like Raosoft.com and Calculator.net, at a confidence level of $9 5 \%$ ) was randomly selected. Then, they were randomly assigned into three groups doing assignments in different modes: interactive digital media assignments (IDMA, $n = 4 4$ ), non-interactive digital media assignments (NDMA, $n = 4 4 \mathrm { \cdot }$ ), and traditional face-to-face assignments (FTFA, $n = 4 4$ ). Some students dropped out (missed the pre-posttests and/or the assignments) so the data relevant to these particular students were excluded and thus the actual sample size was 124 participants: IDMA $\left( n = 4 3 \right)$ , NDMA $( n = 4 1 )$ ), and FTFA $\left( n = 4 0 \right)$ ).

The participants were junior EFL college students in Tanta University in Egypt. Their ages ranged between 19 and 21 years old. They were B2 level, in terms of CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). They were enrolled into two, among other, academic courses: Computer-Assisted Language Instruction and Conversation III courses. The homogeneity of the three groups was checked using Levene’s test of homogeneity of variances of pretest scores (as detailed in the Data Analysis section).

# 3.3.  Instruments

# 3.3.1.  The oral language skills tests and scoring rubric

Two parallel forms of oral language tests, used as pre-and posttests (Appendix B), were prepared and administered online in timed Google Forms where students were required to record their oral responses online (on Vocaroo.com) and paste the links to their recordings in the form. Besides, an oral language analytic scoring rubric (Appendix C) was developed online (in Google Sheets) to score students’ oral responses.

Having reviewed relevant literature and previous studies (e.g. Göktürk, 2016; Kim, 2014; Wulan, 2018; Xie et  al., 2021), the researcher developed the oral language scoring rubric which comprised five criteria: (a) content development/elaboration, (b) fluency, (c) pronunciation, (d) vocabulary, and (e) grammar. As guidelines for raters, task-specific rating scheme with specific performance descriptors were provided. Students’ oral responses were blindly scored by two raters (the researcher and another EFL researcher) using the analytic scoring rubric. Consensus discussion was used to resolve preliminary disagreements between raters till they reached an acceptable agreement level. On a 1 to 5 scale, the raters assigned a score to each criterion by determining the degree to which its sub-items/descriptors are existent in students’ oral samples. That is, raters assigned the score of 1 to the student whose oral sample contained almost none of the sub-items of the very criterion, and they assigned the score of 5 to the one whose sample represents all the sub-items (as indicated in the heading row of the table in Appendix C).

# 3.3.2.  The perceptions survey

An open-ended-question survey (Appendix D) was developed and administered online (in Google Forms) to collect participants’ perceptions of the interactive digital media production activities they practiced. This survey was administered to IDMA group because (based on the quantitative data collected formerly) this group outperformed the other two groups in terms of overall and micro-level oral language skills. Based on Davis (1989) Technology Acceptance Model, the dimensions of the perceptions survey were: perceived attitude, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness.

Content and face validity of the test, scoring rubric, and perceptions survey were judged by a panel of TEFL experts $\left( N { = } 5 \right)$ . Accordingly, necessary wording and other revisions were made. Besides, the tests were also piloted on a sample $\left( N = 2 0 \right)$ of EFL students (other than those assigned for the study). Pilot administration aimed to check the validity and wording difficulties.

# 3.4.  Treatment and data collection

Starting with an orientation session familiarizing participants with digital media assignments and tools (Appendix E), treatment lasted for 8 weeks during the first semester of the academic year 2020/2021. In this semester, students were enrolled in the ‘Computer-Assisted Language Instruction’ course, from which assignment topics were derived. All participants were required to do seven assignments, an assignment per week (Appendix E). The instructor of the course was the researcher, and thus she monitored the three groups, viewed, and gave feedback on the three types of assignments: IDMA, NDMA, and FTFA. IDMA students’ and the instructor’s oral feedback targeted the micro-level constructs: content, fluency, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Since students were required to plan and prepare a script of their oral assignments, the constructs that have been measured might not necessarily represent oral conversation constructs. The following are the phases that IDMA and NDMA students went through. As for FTFA students, they did their assignments traditionally going through two phases: FTFA preparation (orientation to the topic, planning the assignment, collating content material of the assignment, and preparing and rehearsing the script) and face-to-face assignment presentation.

# 3.4.1.  Digital Media assignment preparation

Before producing DMAs each week, students did the following:

a. Assignment Orientation. Having assigned and familiarized students with the DMA topic and publishing platform, the instructor gave the following instructions: DMAs are to be prepared and produced individually. The average length of the video is 2–5 minutes. You are free to choose the filming application, embedded digital media, and the content of the assignment (provided that this video tutorial covers at least two applications used in improving the pre-assigned language skills/item). Direct copying of script material from whatever resources is not allowed. Search for main ideas and guidelines only, but explain and elaborate on them in your own language. Tool or application tutorial should be completely yours (in your own words). The video/audio recording should be done in one shot without any breaks. Although script preparation is permitted, improvisation is preferable, even if at some points. The deadline for publishing the DMA is … (it was preset).   
b. Milestone Planning. Having identified the subtasks, students outlined the phases they would go through allocating suitable time for each subtask. During this, they identified and were guided to the different digital media tools and data resources they would access.   
c. Collating Resources. Students collected material (content main ideas on the assignment topic) and digital resources (still images, animations, hypertext, audio, video, and/or applications) that are essential for fulfilling the task.   
d. Script Preparation and Rehearsal. Students prepared the script to be recorded and then rehearsed it. At this phase, they were guided to pay considerable attention to micro-level oral language skills: content, fluency, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar (as prescribed in the pregiven scoring rubric).   
e. Storyboarding the DMA. Afterwards, they prepared a scenario/storyboard of the DMA by identifying and sequencing the images, animations, hypertext, and/or video that will accompany the recorded script.

# 3.4.2.  Digital media assignment production

Following the storyboard they prepared, they recorded their audio/video file then did the necessary edits. Surprisingly, at this step, students used more and other applications for digital media production than the ones they were guided and trained on in the orientation session. The applications used included:

a. Android/iOS Applications: Filmmaker, VideoShow, Kinemaster, Movie Master, Videomaker, Vivavideo, Wondershare, Filmora, Power Director, InShot, VRecorder, Screen Recorder, and Xrecorder.   
b. Desktop-Based Applications: Photostory, Camtasia Studio 7, Community Clips, Sony Vegas 15 pro, Adobe Premiere.   
c. Web-Based Applications: Voicethread, Edpuzzle, Flipgrid, Youtube, Loom, and Vocaroo.

# 3.4.3.  Digital media assignment publishing

Having finished and done necessary editing, students did the following:

a. Sharing DMA Online. They shared the produced DMA file on the online platform (Appendix E) that is identified for each assignment by the instructor in advance (See Appendix F for links and screenshots of student-generated DMAs).   
b. Asynchronous Interaction. This step was performed by IDMA students only. Having viewed their peers’ DMAs online, they were required to prepare a digital media (mostly a voice recording) feedback file with their corrective and non-corrective comments on the DMA content and form. Online voice recording features of applications like Vocaroo, Voicethread, and Flipgrid were used in this respect. Instructor audio feedback followed this for both IDMA and NDMA groups (See Appendix F).

# 3.5.  Data analysis

# 3.5.1.  Quantitative data analysis

Students’ responses to the oral language pretest and posttest were quantitatively analyzed using the scoring rubric to obtain overall and micro-level oral language skills scores. Consequently, using SPSS 23, the paired-sample $t { \cdot }$ -test and one-way ANOVA tests were used. Prior to conducting the $t { \cdot }$ -test and ANOVA, their main parameters, in addition to the homogeneity of variances of the three groups, were verified (Appendix G).

# 3.5.2.  Qualitative data analysis

Qualitative data collected from the online perceptions survey were thematically analyzed. The researcher adopted the inductive content analysis approach as no themes were predetermined prior to the analysis of raw data. Homogeneity and heterogeneity of themes were checked. To enhance validity, the researcher submitted a subset of data to a peer reviewer who examined them looking for themes that may have been missed by the researcher. Accordingly, emerging themes/subthemes were checked. Next, following a statistics-by-theme approach for joint display of data (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018), the researcher counted the frequencies of codes/ themes across students’ responses. Further, quotes from participants’ responses were cited to illustrate and exemplify the themes. These quotes were selected based on their close representativeness of the themes.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  Quantitative results

To answer the first research question, students’ pretest and posttest scores were compared using the paired-sample $t { \cdot }$ -test. Table 1 contains relevant $t { \cdot }$ -test data.

Results of the paired-sample $t { \cdot }$ -test show that, in the three groups, there were significant differences between students’ pretest and posttest mean scores on overall and micro-level oral language skillsat the 0.05 level in favor of the posttests. This means that IDMA, NDMA, and FTFA students’ overall and micro-level oral language skills improved in their posttests. To compare students’ posttest scores, in an attempt to answer the second research question, one-way ANOVA was used. Table  2 contains relevant data in this respect.

Results of one-way ANOVA show that posttest scores mean differences between the three groups were statistically significant at the 0.05 level. These statistically significant differences were not only in terms of overall oral language skillsscores but also micro-level oral language skills. To find out where exactly the difference lies, multi-pairwise comparisons between the groups were performed using the post-hoc Scheffe test. The results are reported in Table 3.

As indicated in Table 3, there were statistically significant differences between the posttest mean scores of the IDMA group and both NDMA and FTFA groups $\left( p < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ in terms of overall and all micro-level oral language skills. This means that IDMA participants performed better than both NDMA and FTFA ones not only at the level of their total scores but also their sub-scores on each and every oral language skill. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the posttest mean scores of NDMA and FTFA groups $\left( p < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ in terms of only content elaboration and vocabulary. This indicates that NDMA participants outperformed FTFA ones only in content elaboration and vocabulary, whereas they could not in fluency, pronunciation, grammar, or even overall oral language skills.

\* Some students’ responses included more than one theme.

As shown in Table 4, thematic analysis of students’ responses yielded that IDMA students attributed the things they liked to aspects that are related to the different stages of generating DMAs (i.e. preparing, producing, and publishing) and the whole experience they went through. With regard to preparing for the DMA (as mentioned by $1 6 . 3 \%$ of students), students mentioned ‘preparing a script’, ‘searching the web’ for material/resources, and ‘looking for information on the internet’. As to production, as reported by $6 7 . 4 \%$ , using and learning about digital media tools and applications was cited as the most enjoyable factor. Exemplary quotes include ‘discovering more effective apps which I didn’t know about’ and ‘I enjoyed using applications such as filmmaker and screen recorder’. Also, ‘making videos’ and ‘recording’ their voice were mentioned by $2 7 . 9 \%$ . In this respect, students wrote, ‘I enjoyed making videos and having experience with that’ and $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ enjoyed most when I recorded myself and trained much to pronounce well’.

As for publishing, students $( 1 1 . 6 \% )$ reported that they ‘enjoyed sharing projects with [their] colleagues’. One student wrote, ‘Knowing that your work will be published gives you the motive to do your best and challenge yourself to do even better’. Besides, $2 7 . 9 \%$ of students valued the interaction that took place: ‘I enjoyed interacting with my colleagues and their comments on my projects’. and ‘The moment when I commented on other people’s videos and I saw many videos. It was more than wonderful’. Other factors like ‘using audio comments instead of written ones’ and the ‘different topics covered’ were added by $1 4 \%$ of students. Finally, $4 6 . 5 \%$ of students reported that they enjoyed the whole IDMA experience and described it as ‘challenging’, ‘unique’, ‘different’, ‘wonderful’, ‘interesting’, and ‘enjoyable’. In this vein, students wrote, ‘In general, it was an enjoyable experience and really worth going through’ and ‘Really it is an experience [that is] worth practicing in all universities’.

Contrarily, when asked about the things they disliked, nearly half $( 4 8 . 8 \% )$ of IDMA students mentioned technology-related problems like unfamiliarity with some apps (in the beginning) and internet breakdown: ‘Some apps were hard to use at first’ and ‘The thing I hated so much is that the internet [was] often slow and inefficient’. Besides, nearly one quarter $( \% 2 5 . 6 )$ of students reported that they disliked nothing. A quite similar percentage of students $( \% 2 3 . 3 )$ enumerated a number of interaction-related problems like ‘tension’ between them, exaggerated and inappropriate comments, sensitiveness to comments, and ‘miscommunication’. Some of the students’ responses, in this respect, were as follows:

- ‘I hated commenting on others’ projects negatively as it might frustrate them’ - ‘I had a hard time making negative comments to my friends’ projects’ - ‘I have some tension from my friends watching my content’ - ‘Few comments on my project criticize me unfairly’

Further, some students reported their discomfort with the much time spent $( 1 1 . 6 \% )$ and much effort exerted $( 9 . 3 \% )$ on IDMAs. Some students responded, $ { \mathrm { ~  ~ \mathfrak ~ { ~ \mathfrak { ~ ~ \small ~ I ~ } ~ } ~ } }$ just disliked when I made an error on the video and that made me repeat it again’, ‘The project was taking a lot of time and was exhausting me in a terrible way’, and ‘It was very tiring and exhausting in addition to wasting much time’. Also, $9 . 3 \%$ of students added unfamiliarity with DMA topics ‘The topic was not easy for me in the beginning’ and ‘difficult[y] to choose the information that fit the topic and choose the pictures that fit with it, but with more than one project, the matter became easier’.

Concerning the challenges they faced, two-thirds $( 6 2 . 8 \% )$ of students mentioned: ‘weakness of internet’, ‘difficulty to use some applications’, ‘dealing with video editing programs’, and synchronizing their ‘voice with the pictures’. Further, one quarter $( 2 5 . 6 \% )$ of students reported that overcoming speaking apprehension was their biggest challenge: ‘At first, I was afraid to speak in my voice in the videos’ and $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ was scared to talk when I knew that many people were going to listen to me, but …’. A similar percentage $( 2 5 . 6 \% )$ of students mentioned that ‘making sure that the quality of the video was good enough’ was challenging for them. Besides, $1 8 . 6 \%$ of students added ‘searching for useful information’, and ‘collecting the best materials for the projects’. Finally, $1 4 \%$ of students added language-related challenges: ‘to pronounce each word correctly’, ‘to have a good accent’, and ‘to use the correct language and dialect’.

When asked about the benefits they gained from the whole experience, $6 9 . 8 \%$ of students enumerated some technology-related benefits. Exemplary quotes include ‘It gave me a lot of experience in using technology’ and $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ learned how to make a video, add pictures, record my voice, and upload the video to publishing websites’. A quite similar percentage $( 6 7 . 4 \% )$ of students reported a number of language benefits: ‘speak[ing] fluently without hesitation’, ‘improving accent’, ‘developing skills like correct pronunciation and grammar’, ‘improv[ing] accent and listening’, ‘learn[ing] a large number of words’, and ‘improving my English language skills in a great way that I didn’t expect’. As for the personal benefits, as mentioned by $3 9 . 5 \%$ of students, their responses were:

- ‘This experience made me overcome my fear of speaking in general… It made   
me feel confident of myself.’   
- ‘I also learnt to accept all positive and negative opinions.’   
- ‘I have learned self-reliance and patience.’   
- ‘Preparing and adhering to deadlines and completing the task perfectly’   
- ‘Not to be afraid of any new experience.’

# 5.  Discussion

The findings of the study revealed that the participants in all groups showed improvements in overall and micro-level oral language skills. However, quantitative and qualitative data analysis showed that interactive digital media assignments provided an enriching experience that helped IDMA students improve oral language skillsmore than the other groups. That is, in their posttests, IDMA students outperformed both NDMA and FTFA ones not only at the level of overall but micro-level oral language skills as well. Also, comparing NDMA participants’ performance to that of FTFA ones, the former performed better than the latter only in content and vocabulary, whereas they could not in fluency, pronunciation, grammar, or even overall oral language skills. Thus, it can be inferred that DMAs alone helped improve students’ oral content and vocabulary only. However, when done interactively, those DMAs could enhance students’ overall as well as all micro-level oral language skills when compared to face-to-face assignments. Elaborating on and explaining these results, qualitative data revealed that students exhibited and reported increased self-confidence, technical literacy, and language competence and decreased speaking apprehension.

These findings are in line with those of Dzakiah et  al. (2020), Göktürk (2016), Hidayati (2020), Kim (2014), Kirkgöz (2011), Kurwardani and Wahyuni (2013), Lestari (2019), Riyanto (2020), and Spring (2020) who found that videoing/video creation/digital media (audio and/or video) recording could enhance students’ oral language skills. In the same vein, studies on audio/video podcasting assignments (e.g. Díez & Richters, 2020; Juana & Palak, 2011; Wulan, 2018) also revealed corresponding results. Correspondingly, Dooly and Sadler (2016), Foss et  al. (2008), and Miller and Hafner (2014) have specifically suggested that digital audio/video projects can help improve students’ English communicative ability. Study findings are also concurrent with those of Lee (2014) who concluded that students’ audio recordings and interaction enhanced their oral language skills. In respect of micro-level oral language skills, studies on digital audio/video recording projects yielded comparable results as they reported improvements in these skills as shown in Table 5.

Additionally, some of these studies reported comparable results in terms of the positive impact on the participants’ affective and psychological aspects. For example, Göktürk (2016), Kim (2014), Kurwardani and Wahyuni (2013), Lee (2014), and Miller and Hafner (2014) concluded that students had greater self-confidence and increased motivation after creating digital audio/video recordings in English. According to Göktürk (2016), this possibly might be because students viewed these digital assignments as a challenging EFL learning experience rather than as a tool for assessment. Reiteration of those digital media assignments gave them a sense of achievement and fostered their sense of ownership. In addition, Madzlan et  al. (2020) and Sun (2012) reported that online audio/video recording led to less feeling of anxiety and speaking apprehension and more confidence in expressing themselves. Similar results were affirmed by those of Bashori et  al. (2020), and Leahy (2008) on online oral interaction. Also, Lee (2014) reported that peer‐to‐peer interaction using online digital recording and interaction promoted autonomous learning and augmented student engagement.

However, the results of the current study are partially not consistent with those of Spring (2020) who found that creating short video oral projects did not significantly affect EFL learners’ vocabulary though he also found that students’ fluency, pronunciation, and grammar improved (in which respects it is compatible with the current study). Also, the current study findings are, in part, incompatible with those of Göktürk (2016) who concluded that EFL students’ digital video recordings did not contribute to the enhancement of their oral fluency though he found that they bolstered students’ content elaboration, vocabulary, and overall oral language skills (where, specifically, it is in agreement with the current study). Besides, Chien et  al. (2020) results partially contradict those at hand as they found that, in a spherical video-based virtual reality context, the peer-assessment (interactive) group performed better than the non-peer assessment (non-interactive) group in terms of fluency but not content, pronunciation, vocabulary, or grammar.

Further, in Ebadi and Asakereh (2018) and Hsu’s (2016) studies, asynchronous interaction using VoiceThread–based audio recording and voice blogging, respectively, did not help learners outperform face-toface ones in terms of speaking accuracy (or even fluency, in the case of Hsu’s study). Actually, in these studies, dependence on asynchronous interaction tools only (VoiceThread and Voice Blogs) might provide a reasonable justification for these contradictory results. Generally, differences in population, research design, assigned topics and tasks, and the research settings of the studies could possibly justify the differences and sometimes discrepancies between findings (Hafour & Al-Rashidy, 2020). As pointed out by some PBLL studies, the type of assignment/ project and how it is implemented have a great impact on how much it will benefit participants (Foss et  al., 2008; Spring, 2020).

On the one hand, improvements in IDMA students’ overall oral language skills could potentially be due to practicing both asynchronous interaction and digital media production activities. Preparing a script for the digital media recording, double-checking it, seeking the help of others, then rehearsing it several times, all had a positive impact on students’ oral language skills (Dugartsyrenova & Sardegna, 2017; Spring, 2020). Kurwardani and Wahyuni (2013) added that, by reviewing and watching the digital recording repeatedly, the students could notice their mistakes so they could eliminate or even diminish them and thus improve their oral skills. Besides, publishing and sharing their DMAs with others enriched their oral production skills. In fact, knowing that their DMAs would be reviewed by their peers also positively affected the quality of the generated DMAs and, consequently, the language used. This is emphasized by Bouyias and Demetriadis (2012) who claimed that, under proper and acceptable pressure of peer assessment, the learners were stimulated to challenge themselves and go through a number of trials to produce better recordings.

On the other hand, significant differences between NDMA and FTFA groups, in favor of the former, imply that DMAs only helped students develop better content and use a wider range of words appropriately than those who did face-to-face oral assignments. NDMA students outperformed FTFA ones in communication-relevant aspects (i.e. content and vocabulary) since, in Dooly and Sadler (2016) terms, PBLL DMAs are ‘highly communicative’. To explain, according to Göktürk (2016) and Madzlan et  al. (2020), digital media tasks act as a spur for them to express themselves freely in a relaxing context without experiencing the pressures they might have in face-to-face classes. This led to focusing on content (idea elaboration and vocabulary) more than form (accuracy of pronunciation and grammar) since fulfilling the task becomes their main concern here (Göktürk, 2016; Sun, 2012). Non-significant differences between NDMA and FTFA groups at the level of fluency, pronunciation, and grammar could possibly be attributed to the missing interaction activities that IDMA students were privileged by.

Eventually, based on the findings of the current study, it is highly recommended that researchers, teachers, practitioners, and instructional designers, incorporate digital media projects in EFL contexts and explore their varied EFL potentials. The study also puts forward a framework of student production and interaction practices and applications that can be utilized for manifold EFL purposes. More importantly, to fully benefit from EFL digital media production activities, teachers and educators are required to consider the technical and interaction-related problems (as revealed by the qualitative findings of the study) and find ways to overcome or, at least, decrease them.

# 6.  Limitations and suggestions for future research

The implications inferred from the findings of the current study reveal the significance of asynchronous online interaction during digital media assignment production on EFL students’ oral language skills. However, some limitations may avert generalizing these results. To elaborate, this study was delimited to asynchronous interaction only as well as assessing presentational speaking (the type of speaking practiced during DMA recording) not interactional speaking. As such, since students were required to plan and prepare a script of their oral assignments, the constructs that have been measured might not necessarily represent oral conversation constructs. Besides, this study lasted for only 8 weeks, which (while being sufficient to yield positive significant results) is not a completely adequate period for cultivating productive micro skills like EFL oral language skills.

Confining DMAs to Computer-Assisted Language Instruction topics and the researcher being the instructor of the 3 groups are other limitations of the study. In addition, pronunciation has been measured in light of the new developments in the field of EIL (English as an International Language), and thus the focus was on accuracy and comprehensibility rather than being native-like. Accordingly, the findings of the current study ought to be interpreted cautiously.

The limitations of the current study are considered implicit recommendations for further research. In other words, replicating the current study in other EFL contexts, involving students in both interactional and presentational speaking activities on a variety of topics for longer periods, would probably reveal interesting and comparable results that might broaden and validate the findings of the study at hand. Also, an interesting field for future research is to compare the effect of synchronous and asynchronous online interaction on different macro-and micro-level oral language skills. Besides, more research and additional quantitative and qualitative data are needed to further understand the underlying complexities and nature of interaction taking place on online (digital media) platforms making use of the learning analytics tools and features of these platforms.

# Pre/post oral language skills test prompts

# Pretest

Topic: Some teachers enjoy taking risks and trying new techniques, methods, and technologies in teaching. Others are not adventurous; they are cautious and prefer to avoid taking risks especially when their classes are doing well. Which behavior do you think is better? Explain why (supporting your answer with personal experiences or examples).

# Posttest

Topic: Some teachers are against using new technology in teaching and learning claiming that it may disconnect students from face-to-face relationships. Others call for the full exploitation and implementation of recent technological trends and applications in their classes. Which behavior do you think is better? Explain why (supporting your answer with personal experiences or examples).

# Appendix G

# T-test and one-way ANOVA parameters verification

Taking into consideration that the study sample was randomly selected and that the posttest scores are independent of pretest ones, the first two assumptions were verified. As for the third assumption of normality of distribution, skewness and kurtosis values were used in addition to graphical methods (like the histogram and Q-Q plot). This is, according to Kim (2013), because they are more robust than statistical tests of normality (like Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov). Oral language skills pretest scores were found to be normally distributed as yielded by Q-Q plots and skewness and kurtosis indices. As shown in Table G1, the estimated values of skewness and kurtosis were found to be within the allowable ranges of $\pm 2$ (Field, 2009; Gravetter & Wallnau, 2014).

Table G1. D escriptive statistics of oral language pretest scores.

The fourth assumption of homogeneity of variances was also checked using Levene’s test. Table G2 presents the result of Levene’s test of oral language skills pretest scores of the three groups.

As shown in Table G2, the three groups were found to be homogenous in terms of oral language skills pretest scores $\left( p > 0 . 0 5 \right)$ . Additionally, to ensure that there were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in terms of their oral language skills pretest scores one-way ANOVA test was conducted.
