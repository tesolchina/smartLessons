Grammatical complexity Academic writing L2 writing development Clausal complexity Phrasal complexity

This study aims to estimate the developmental trajectory of grammatical complexity for L2 writers by investigating the extent to which clausal and phrasal complexity is associated with L2 writing proficiency. The corpus used in this study contained 234 argumentative essays of first-year Korean college students at three proficiency levels. The five clausal and four phrasal features were extracted from the tagged corpus to count the frequency of each complexity feature. Our findings demonstrated an association between writing proficiency and clausal and phrasal complexity. Especially noteworthy was that the main source of complexity at each proficiency level (i.e., finite adverbial clauses, WH relative clauses, of phrases as nominal postmodifiers) showed a gradual increase in complexity in terms of two parameters: structural type and syntactic function. A qualitative follow-up analysis provided a detailed description of differences among developmental levels, especially with respect to the lexical associations of particular complexity features. Pedagogical implications are for using empirically derived developmental stages in creating detailed rating scale descriptors and providing more customized writing courses accordingly.

# 1. Introduction

Complexity, along with accuracy and fluency, has long been viewed as a key dimension characterizing qualities of second language (L2) performance (Housen and Kuiken, 2009; Norris and Ortega, 2009; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998). In particular, a range of studies has indicated that grammatical complexity is a reliable indicator of L2 writing development. Particularly noteworthy is Biber et al.’s (2011) corpus-based register research that hypothesized the developmental progression from clausal to phrasal complexity, specifically noun phrase (NP) complexity. Numerous studies based on Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental index lend further credence to their hypothesis, demonstrating a strong correlation between phrasal nominal modifiers and L2 writing proficiency (e.g., Kim, 2020; Lan et al., 2019a; Parkinson and Musgrave, 2014), or L2 writing quality (e.g., Kyle and Crossley, 2018; Taguchi et al., 2013). Some L2 writing studies, however, have yielded conflicting results, suggesting that NP complexity has little predictive power, particularly for writing quality (e.g., Crossley and McNamara, 2014; Guo et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015). As Lu (2011) pointed out, one possible reason underlying this inconsistency might be the use of corpus data from learners of heterogeneous first language (L1) backgrounds in most of these studies, despite potential L1 influence on grammatical complexity of L2 writing. Besides, despite substantial empirical evidence on differences across registers in the lexical associations of each grammatical feature (e.g., Biber et al., 1999), there is a paucity of research investigating the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between lexico-grammatical patterns produced by L2 writers and those characteristic of the target registerdacademic writing. Moreover, little is known about how lexical association patterns in L2 writing gradually align with those observed in formal academic writing throughout various stages of development. Thus, this study aims to elucidate the developmental patterns of grammatical complexity first by investigating the extent to which the use of clausal and phrasal features is associated with the quality of argumentative essays of L2 writers with the same L1 background (i.e., Korean), then by examining differences among developmental levels in the actual use of these features, especially in terms of their lexical realizations.

# 2.1. Grammatical complexity in L2 writing

According to Bulté and Housen’s (2012) taxonomic model of L2 complexity, grammatical complexity is a subconstruct of linguistic complexity that has two different interpretations: system complexity and structure complexity, or more specifically, breadth (“diversity of different structures”) and depth (“formal and functional complexity of an L2 feature”) (p. 25). Similarly, many L2 writing researchers have described grammatical complexity from two common perspectives. For instance, Ortega (2003) conceptualized it as “the range of forms that surface in language production and the degree of sophistication of such forms” (p. 492). Rimmer (2006) conveyed a similar perspective by defining range of grammar as “the number of different grammatical forms used and their complexity” (p. 498). Lu (2011) also posited two facets of grammatical complexity: syntactic variation and sophistication, defined as “the range of syntactic structures” and “the degree of sophistication of such structures,” respectively (p. 36). Following Ortega (2003) and Lu (2011), Crossley and McNamara (2014) associated grammatical complexity with “the sophistication of syntactic forms” and “the range or variety of syntactic forms produced” (p. 67). The shared argument captured in these definitions is that L2 writers produce increasingly diverse and sophisticated grammatical structures as proficiency develops. In other words, the diversity of grammatical structures and their degree of sophistication can be useful indicators of writing proficiency. Scholars of register variation, such as Biber et al. (2011), go further by pointing out that grammatical complexity is highly context-dependent and needs to be evaluated in consideration of specific registers (Lan et al., 2019a). Similarly, recent grammatical complexity research from a genre-based perspective underscores the significance of employing functionally appropriate complex structures within specific genres (Lu et al., 2020). This is true for written academic discourse, where such structures are utilized to increase conciseness and informativeness (Wu et al., 2020) Considering these views, the following section discusses how grammatical diversity and sophistication within a specific register of L2 writing can be best captured.

# 2.2. Clausal and phrasal complexity in relation to L2 writing development

Biber et al.’s (2011) large-scale corpus study showed that “the complexity of conversation is clausal, whereas the complexity of academic writing is phrasal” (p. 22). More specifically, according to two major parameters of register variation identified in their study, i.e., structural form and syntactic function, the most favored types of complexity in conversation are finite dependent clauses that function as clause constituents, whereas the most prominent types in academic prose are phrasal structures that fuction as NP constituents. Assuming that grammatical structures typical of written texts are acquired relatively later than those typical of conversation, Biber et al. (2011) created a developmental index of complexity that progresses from relying on clausal subordination to phrasal elaboration, specifically via compressed NPs. Biber et al.’s (2011) index can be argued to offer concrete measures to operate grammatical diversity and sophistication of L2 writing at differing proficiency levels by addressing multidimensional and developmental construct of complexity. This supports the suggestion by Norris and Ortega (2009) that “devising measures that include a wide range of developmentally ranked structures” is needed to “characterize L2 production that ranges along the full developmental continuum” (p. 567).

Motivated by Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental framework based on L1 writers, numerous studies have set out to empirically test if L2 writers also follow that pattern. These investigations have produced mixed findings, with some studies (e.g., Casal and Lee, 2019; Kyle and Crossley, 2018; Maxwell-Reid and Kartika-Ningsih, 2020; Taguchi et al., 2013) showing a positive association between writing quality and phrasal complexity and others (e.g., Crossley and McNamara, 2014; Guo et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015) indicating no significant association. Specifically, Taguchi et al. (2013) examined differences in clausal and phrasal complexity between higher- and lower-rated L2 placement exam essays. The most striking differences were found in two features of phrasal complexity, namely attributive adjectives and post-noun-modifying prepositional phrases, both of which exhibited significantly higher frequency in the high-rated essays. Similar findings were yielded in Kyle and Crossley’s (2018) study, which investigated the type of syntactic complexity contributing most to the quality of argumentative essays. The combined predictor model demonstrated that fine-grained phrasal complexity associated with prepositional object dependents, direct object dependents, and nominal subject dependents accounts for a substantial amount of the variance in holistic essay scores, with fine-gained clausal complexity only having additional explanatory power. Casal and Lee (2019) also attempted to distinguish high-, mid-, and low-rated research papers by employing NP complexity-related measures including one holistic measure (i.e., complex nominal per clause) and five fine-grained measures (i.e., pre-adjective, post-preposition, participle, possessive noun, and relative clause). A one-way MANOVA test revealed that higher-rated papers exhibited higher degrees of both global and phrasal complexity, particularly with regards to preadjective, participle, and post-preposition. Furthermore, Maxwell-Reid and Kartika-Ningsih (2020) found a positive correlation between high quality writing and the use of clausal embedding in nominal groups. Nominal group embedding was found to serve textual functions, indicating text organization and building a chain of reasoning.

However, some studies have challenged the prevailing notion of a strong association between writing quality and phrasal complexity, specifically in NPs. In Guo et al.’s (2013) study, neither of the two features examined pertaining to NP complexity (i.e., nominalizations, the number of modifiers per NP) was reported as a reliable predictor of the quality of integrated and independent essays administered in the TOEFL iBT. Yang et al. (2015), who examined the association between ESL graduate students’ writing quality and syntactic complexity, reported that complex NPs per clause (CNP/C), which was the only NPrelated feature analyzed in this study, had little predictive power for writing scores. By examining clausal and phrasal complexity in essays of L2 students in a university ESL and EAP program, Crossley and McNamara (2014) also argued that the two NP-related features examined (i.e., number of modifiers per NP, subject relative clauses) were not highly predictive of human judgment of writing quality, while acknowledging the nominal style of advanced L2 writers. In other words, while L2 writers show increasingly greater phrasal complexity as they progress, human raters assess essay quality primarily based on the extent of clausal complexity.

Studies that focused on NP complexity in relation to L2 writing proficiency by drawing on Biber et al.’s (2011) index for noun modifiers have also presented different results that partially contradict the developmental sequence hypothesized by Biber et al. (2011). For instance, Parkinson and Musgrave (2014), who compared the less proficient EAP writing with the more proficient MA writing, generally lend support for Biber et al.’s (2011) hypothesis in the sense that the EAP writing showed a significantly higher proportion of attributive adjectives (Stages 2), while demonstrating a significantly lower proportion of premodifying nouns (Stage 3) and prepositional phrases other than of with abstract meaning (Stage 4). However, the finding that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of of phrases with concrete/locative meaning or abstract meaning (Stages 3 and 4) contrasts with the findings of Biber et al. (2011). In a similarly designed study, Lan et al. (2019a) demonstrated a significant association between the students’ writing proficiency levels and 11 nominal modifiers in Biber et al.’s (2011) index. The post-hoc residual analysis further revealed that the more advanced group produced attributive adjectives (Stage 2) and relative clauses (Stage 3) more than expected, whereas the less advanced group produced premodifying nouns (Stage 3) and postmodifying of phrases (Stage 4) more than expected. The heavy reliance of less proficient writers on advanced noun modifiers differed from Biber et al.’s (2011) findings, although the researchers partially accounted for these results through topic influence and grammatical function involved. In Kim’s (2020) study as well, the use of 7 nominal modifiers was examined to determine whether adjacent levels of L2 writers can be distinguished by adopting the use of noun modifiers as discriminators for placement decisions. The results validated Biber et al.’s (2011) framework, showing that four nominal modifiers (i.e., premodifying adjective, prepositional phrase of, prepositional phrase other than of (abstract), multiple prepositional phrases) had a strong correlation with raters’ placement decisions. However, in terms of the relative contribution of the four noun modifiers to placement decisions, prepositional phrases of (Stage 3) were found to be most influential, whereas prepositional phrases other than of (abstract) (Stage 4) displayed the least impact. This result contradicted their corresponding developmental stages in Biber et al.’s (2011) model, although this discrepancy could possibly be ascribed to range restriction and the impact of timing condition as noted by the researcher.

The conflicting results for NP complexity could be at least partially attributed to the research design that failed to consider L1 factors in that with the exception of Lan et al. (2019a), all research discussed thus far used writing samples from learners of mixed L1s.1 As Lu (2011) noted, studies without considering L1 backgrounds “render(s) the reliability of the results obtained contingent on the untested assumption that the learner’s L1 does not significantly affect the relationship between syntactic complexity and language development” (p. 60). However, L1 influence on the use of complexity features has been empirically proven (e.g., Crossley and McNamara, 2012; Kang, 2005; Lu and Ai, 2015; Staples and Reppen, 2016), pointing to the importance of addressing L1 factors when examining the relationship between grammatical complexity and writing proficiency. Thus, this study used corpus data collected from writers of the same L1 Korean background to explore the developmental patterns of grammatical complexity that can be potentially affected by learners’ L1.

# 2.3. Lexical associations of grammatical complexity features

Writing development cannot be assessed solely by more or less usage of particular grammatical features, given the systematically different register-dependent lexical associations. The interconnected nature of grammar and lexis has been empirically demonstrated by Biber et al.’s (1999) corpus-based investigation on the actual use of grammatical features in four major registers. They found that grammatical structures typically co-occur with an associated set of lexical items and these lexico-grammatical associations are not arbitrary restrictions, but rather motivated by underlying communicative purposes. Thus, for example, the lexico-grammatical patterns identified in conversation differ significantly from those identified in academic writing because the communicative goals of conversational speakers and academic writers are quite different.

Although Biber et al.’s (2011) index is composed mainly of grammatical features, they noted that lexico-grammatical information from Biber et al. (1999) was utilized in postulating the developmental sequence. Specifically, that-clauses controlled by a restricted set of verbs that are particularly common in conversation (e.g., think, know) are placed in Stage 1, while the same structural types controlled by a broader spectrum of verbs are placed in Stage 2. Likewise, to-clauses occurring with conversational controlling verbs (e.g., want) are assumed to be acquired earlier (Stage 2) than complete command of these target features with more diverse verbs (Stage 3). Regarding these two types of complement clauses, Biber and Reppen (1998) reported that the patterns of lexical association found in L2 writing were “similar to those found in native conversation and fiction, but strikingly different from those found in native academic prose” (p. 157). In other words, the extremely frequent use of conversational controlling verbs such as think, know, and want was evident in L2 writing. More recent L2 writing studies found similar lexical association patterns that deviate from academic norms, observing the predominant use of few verbs suited for conversation (e.g., Oh, 2007; Parkinson, 2013; Staple and Reppen, 2016). These studies consistently uphold the notion that greater use of particular grammatical features does not necessarily represent greater development and their lexical realization should be considered together from a register perspective.

However, most previous research on grammatical development in L2 writers has primarily focused on the frequency of complex structures without further investigating their lexical realizations (e.g., Casal and Lee, 2019; Crossley and McNamara, 2014; Kyle and Crossley, 2018). Alternatively, some studies have solely examined overall lexical diversity or sophistication (e.g., Guo et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015). Only a limited number of studies have addressed the lexical choices associated with a few select complexity features. Specifically, lexico-grammatical patterns have been examined in verb complement clauses in relation to genre effects (Taguchi et al., 2013), postmodifying prepositional phrases in relation to the abstractness of head nouns (Parkinson and Musgrave, 2014), or premodifying nouns and attributive adjectives in relation to topic effects (Lan et al., 2022; Lan et al., 2019a). Thus, for a more accurate estimation of writing development, this study first examined the association between L2 writing proficiency and the frequencies of clausal and phrasal complexity features, and then qualitatively analyzed student writing, especially in terms of lexico-grammatical associations. Accordingly, research questions are formulated as follows:

1. Is there an association between L2 writing proficiency and clausal and phrasal complexity? 2. What developmental patterns can be observed based on complexity features that contribute to the association the most? 3. What differences in the actual use of complexity features exist across proficiency levels?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Learner corpus

This study used a subset of the Yonsei English Learner Corpus (YELC 2011, Rhee and Jung 2014). YELC 2011, developed from 2011 to 2012 by Yonsei University in Korea, consists of 3,286 narrative and argumentative essays written by 3,286 first-year students of Yonsei University in its English placement test. The corpus for this study was compiled by randomly extracting 234 argumentative essays on six different topics: (a) allowing physical punishment in schools, (b) using cellular phones while driving, (c) prohibiting smoking in public buildings, (d) using animals in medical experiments, (e) Korea’s policy of compulsory military service, and (f) the real-name policy for the Internet.2 The essays were graded based on nine levels (A1, $\mathsf { A } 1 + ,$ A2, B1, ${ \mathsf { B } } 1 + ,$ B2, $^ { \mathsf { B 2 + } }$ , C1, C2) that subdivided the six CEFR levels to better represent the learner’s performance. The corpus used in this study consists of three subcorpora representing the low (A1 and $\mathsf { A } 1 + \mathbf { \bar { \Sigma } }$ ), intermediate (B1 and ${ \bf B } 1 + { \bf \Sigma } .$ ), and high levels $[ \mathsf { B } 2 + , \mathsf { C } 1$ , and C2) of L2 writing proficiency.3 Given the inherent imbalance in the total number of tokens across the three subcorpora, it was necessary to normalize the frequencies of the target features in each subcorpus to ensure comparability. Details about each subcorpus are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 Description of the corpus.

# 3.2. Grammatical complexity measures

Drawing on Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental index, this study measured grammatical complexity at two levels: clause and phrase level. Table 2 lists five clausal and four phrasal complexity features examined.4 The combined use of clause- and phrase-level measures was pursued in this study to unveil a more complete picture of developmental patterns across proficiency levels (Norris and Ortega, 2009).

Table 2 Clause- and phrase-level complexity measures.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Clause-level complexity measures</td><td>Phrase-level complexity measures</td></tr><tr><td>Finite adverbial clause</td><td>Premodifying adjective</td></tr><tr><td>Causative clause (because)</td><td>Attributive</td></tr><tr><td>Conditional clause (if)</td><td>Participial</td></tr><tr><td>Concessive clause (although)</td><td>Premodifying noun</td></tr><tr><td>Verb/adjective complement clause</td><td>Prepositional phrase of as postmodifier</td></tr><tr><td>Verb + that clause</td><td>Prepositional phrase other than of as postmodifier</td></tr><tr><td>Verb + WH clause</td><td>In as postmodifier</td></tr><tr><td>Adjective + that clause</td><td>On as postmodifier</td></tr><tr><td>Noun complement clause</td><td>With as postmodifier</td></tr><tr><td>Noun + that clause</td><td>For as postmodifier</td></tr><tr><td>That relative clause</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>WH relative clause</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

# 3.3. Corpus tagging and extraction process

The corpus was annotated by automatic part-of-speech (POS) tagging software, CLAWS. The CLAWS achieved an accuracy of $9 7 . 5 4 \%$ when tagging 30 writing samples comprising a total of 9,385 word tokens. The extraction of complexity features in Table 2 from the tagged corpus was performed through the two-step process: (1) automatic extraction and (2) visual inspection. For the first step, regular expressions (regex) for each complexity feature were generated based on the CLAWS C7 tagset. Using regex containing POS information, concordance lines with target features could be obtained in text editor Notepad $^ { + + }$ . Next, the visual inspection process required observing each concordance line to enhance the accuracy rate. To illustrate, since the automatic analysis failed to distinguish between that relative clauses and that complement clauses and between prepositional phrases as adverbials versus postnominal modifiers, they should be manually checked to determine their syntactic function. Besides, of phrases following package nouns (e.g., kind of, lot of) were omitted from the study as they are “not true instances of postmodification” (Biber et al., 1999, p. 636). Two species nouns (i.e., type(s) of, species of) were the exception because they are commonly used in academic discourse due to their classifying function (Biber et al., 1999). With respect to finite complement clauses controlled by adjectives or verbs, only post-predicate complement clauses (e.g., I’m sure that .) were considered, excluding extraposed ones (e.g., It is clear that .), because extraposed that-clauses, which are more prevalent in academic writing than in conversation, represent a higher degree of production complexity than other clausal features typical in conversation (Biber et al., 2011). Lastly, prefabricated expressions such as lexical bundles (e.g., in other words) and phrasal verbs (e.g., take care of) were removed from the output.

The accuracy rate of automatic extraction accompanied by visual inspection was obtained by manually coding the occurrences of all the target features in randomly selected 30 writing samples (approximately $1 0 \%$ of the total texts) and comparing the outcome of the manual work to that of automatic extraction and visual inspection. The overall accuracy rate for all the complexity features (i.e., $9 7 . 6 \%$ ) was considered high enough for subsequent data analysis.

# 3.4. Data analysis

This study conducted both quantitative and qualitative data analyses to address the three research questions. For quantitative analysis, two statistical tests were used in Statistical Package for Social Sciences 26 (SPSS): a Pearson Chi-square test and a residual analysis (Lan et al., 2022; Lan et al., 2019a). Firstly, the Chi-square test was performed to test if there is an association between the nine complexity features and L2 writing proficiency. The normed frequencies (per 10,000 words) were used in the Chi-square test to minimize the influence of text length. Given that the Chi-square test is “a significance statistic,” Cramer’s V was applied in tandem to reveal “the strength of the association” (McHugh, 2013, p. 148). Secondly, a residual analysis was undertaken as follow-up probing to identify developmental patterns based on complexity features that influence the association the most. To be precise, adjusted standardized residuals, rather than raw residuals, were used, given the effect of cell size (Sharpe, 2015). This study adopted $\pm 2$ criteria when identifying cells with large residuals, following the rule of thumb in statistics (Agresti, 2018) and previous L2 writing research that has applied these criteria (Lan et al., 2022). Lastly, quantitative findings were checked again by qualitatively reviewing the actual use of complexity features in student writing. The qualitative review primarily examined the lexical associations of five grammatical structures: finite adverbial clauses, verb/adjective complement clauses, noun complement clauses, premodifyng adjectives, and premodifying nouns. This aimed to provide a more comprehensive picture of the developmental patterns of grammatical complexity. Initially, the two researchers, holding either a master’s degree in English language education or a doctor’s degree in applied linguistics, independently coded and counted $1 0 \%$ of the concordance lines to measure lexical diversity. To illustrate, finite adverbial clauses were categorized by subordinators (e.g., because, $i f )$ , finite complement clauses by controlling words (e.g., think, convinced, argument), and phrasal noun modifiers by the adjectives and nouns employed (e.g., physical, democracy). In this process, minor spelling errors were disregarded if they did not hinder the conveyance of meaning. Additionally, the researchers assessed lexical choices and their functional effectiveness in relation to academic writing norms for finite adverbial clauses and finite complement clauses, considering not only lexical diversity but also adherence to academic register. Several corpusbased studies (e.g., Biber et al., 1999; Jiang, 2015; Staple and Reppen, 2016) served as valuable resources to identify academically oriented lexical choices that enable more sophisticated arguments, as well as to evaluate the progress of student writers towards the target register. There was little room for subjective judgment to be involved in the analysis of lexical performance, as it quantitatively measured the range of vocabulary within specific grammatical structures and drew upon prior research on lexico-grammatical patterns within specific registers. Consequently, one of the researchers checked the remaining concordance lines in terms of lexical diversity and choices reflecting academic norms.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. The association between L2 writing proficiency and clausal and phrasal complexity

Table 3 presents the normed frequency per 1,000 words and the standard deviation for each grammatical complexity feature. With respect to clausal features, three out of five (i.e., finite adverbial clause, verb/adjective complement clause, that relative clause) were most common in the low-rated essays, whereas one feature (i.e., noun complement clause) was most common in the high-rated essays. WH relative clauses were clearly distinguished from all the other features by their highest frequency in the midrated essays. In contrast, all the phrasal features were most prevalent in the high-rated essays. The most striking difference in frequency was found in of phrase as nominal postmodifiers. These preliminary results suggest that the lower-rated essays could be considered more grammatically complex than the higher-rated ones when considering clausal complexity, but the very opposite could be the case with phrasal complexity. Table 3 also indicates that as opposed to nominal premodifiers (i.e., premodifying adjectives and nouns), nominal postmodifiers (i.e., prepositional phrases of and other than of) exhibited a gradual increase in frequency towards the higher proficiency levels, tentatively suggesting that postmodification provides better indicators of advanced proficiency levels than premodification. This finding may be attributed, at least partially, to the learners’ L1 background, because Korean is a head-final language that restricts the extension of noun phrases through postmodifiers (Baik, 1994).

Note. The asterisk $( ^ { * } )$ indicates that the high-rated essays exhibit the highest normed frequency of a given complexity feature.

The association between L2 writing proficiency and the five clausal and four phrasal features was statistically analyzed by the Pearson Chi-square $( \chi ^ { 2 } )$ test. The results indicate a significant association $\bar { \cdot { \chi } ^ { 2 } } = 6 7 . 9 2 2$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 1 6$ , $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } = . 0 0 0 ^ { \cdot } } \end{array}$ . However, the value of Cramer’s $\mathsf { V }$ for strength testing (.100) implies that the association is weak and that $1 0 . 0 \%$ variance of writing proficiency levels can be explained by considering the use of nine complexity features. The small effect size is a predictable outcome, though, in a research context where a limited set of fine-grained measures are employed “in a complex register (i.e., academic writing) to investigate their association with a complex construct (i.e., writing proficiency)” (Lan et al., 2019a, p. 8). A larger effect size can be generated by examining the co-occurrence of a wide variety of linguistic features rather than any isolated features because human raters are considerably more sensitive to their constellation with a priority on overall communicative effectiveness (Biber et al., 2016; Friginal et al., 2014). Taken together, while the Cramer’s V value (.100) shows a small effect size from a statistical standpoint, it is crucial to interpret this result in light of the complex nature of writing proficiency, which can be influenced by diverse factors encompassing grammar usage, discourse competence, content, and organization. Given this intricate nature of writing proficiency, it was impressive to see that only nine grammatical features can explain $1 0 . 0 \%$ variance of differing proficiencies. Consequently, the effect size can be perceived as relatively large for these nine grammatical features.

# 4.2. The developmental patterns of complexity

As a follow-up testing, a residual analysis was conducted to pinpoint which complexity features made significant contributions to the magnitude of the value resulting from the Chi-square test. Table 4 presents the adjusted standardized residuals of the nine complexity features (see Appendix for further details of the observed and expected count output from SPSS). Based on the cut-off value |2.0|, a total of five complexity features, marked with single asterisk $( ^ { * } )$ in the table, have large adjusted residuals, suggesting that these five features made great contributions to the association between L2 writing proficiency and grammatical complexity.

Note. Single asterisk $( ^ { * } )$ indicates the complexity features that make great contributions to the association. Double asterisk $^ { ( * * ) }$ indicates the main source of complexity at each proficiency level.

The features with large residuals have positive or negative values. Accordingly, two different interpretations are made for each proficiency level: (1) the low-rated essays contained finite adverbial clauses more than expected while containing noun complement clauses, WH relative clauses, and prepositional phrases of and other than of less than expected; (2) the mid-rated essays contained WH relative clauses more than expected; (3) the high-rated essays contained prepositional phrases of more than expected while containing finite adverbial clauses less than expected.

In particular, the main source of complexity at each proficiency level, marked with double asterisk $( ^ { * * } )$ in the table, suggests that the development proceeds from (i) reliance on finite adverbial clauses; through (ii) heavy use of WH relative clauses; to finally, (iii) a marked preference for of phrases. The developmental pattern for Korean college students thus can be accounted for by adopting the two parameters suggested by Biber et al. (2011) as critical determinants of development (see Table 5). In other words, L1 Korean writers showed a gradual increase in complexity as proficiency improved in terms of structural and syntactic parameters.

Interestingly, Lan et al.’s (2019b) study for L1 Chinese writers at two proficiency levels suggests quite different patterns of development, showing that writing proficiency was positively associated with relative clauses but negatively associated with of phrases. These findings seem to be related partly to the characteristics of Chinese language, where noun-modifying elements “must occur in front of that noun” (Li and Thompson, 1981, p. 104) and the semantic relationship between two clauses is not explicitly stated but “must be inferred” (ibid., p. 641). Considering these characteristics, one could postulate that L1 Chinese writers can find post-noun-modifying clausal features of English such as relative clauses most challenging. On the other hand, most of phrases used by low-proficiency students in Lan et al. (2019a) can be considered easily accessible to L1 Chinese writers because they were not true postmodifiers of a noun, occurring after package nouns (e.g., kind of). Korean also has a head-final NP structure but relative flexibility in combining clauses (Kang, 2005). These characteristics support the relative ease of acquiring clausal modifiers such as relative clauses compared to phrasal modifiers such as prepositional phrases. Besides, the requirement that a modifying clause must precede a head noun in Korean language prevents the use of multiple modifying clauses due to parsing difficulties; by the effect of that, “multiple short sentences combined together with conjunctions” are preferred in Korean (Baik, 1994, p. 162). It thus seems reasonable to hypothesize that finite adverbial clauses would be readily acceptable to L1 Korean writers, as shown in the result of the present study. The causal links between L2 features preferred at each proficiency level and L1 characteristics may offer evidence for possible L1 impacts on the use of complexity features in L2 writing.

4.3. Differences in the actual use of complexity features across proficiency levels

# 4.3.1. Clausal complexity features

The principal clause-level complexity feature distinguishing low from high writing proficiency is finite adverbial clauses (because, if, although) with the low-proficiency students using them much more than expected while the high-proficiency students using them much less than expected. Not only is a dense use of subordinate clauses unsuited for academic writing, but it is also problematic as it may lead to “an overly complex sentence that is difficult to follow” (Taguchi et al., 2013, p. 426). Thus, as illustrated in the examples below, more advanced writers would express the same content using phrasal elaboration instead of clausal subordination for clear and condensed information.

(1) If physical punishment is not hard, it is needed. <Low, file $3 2 2 >$ (2) Surely, excessive physical punishment can be a problem. <High, file $1 0 6 1 >$

Surprisingly, though, when looking at each type of finite adverbial clauses separately (see Figure 1), conditional and concessive clauses did not exhibit the same pattern as causative clauses where a salient decreasing pattern in frequency occurred as proficiency improved. This finding is in line with Staples and Reppen (2016), who reported conflicting results for causative and conditional clauses in their relationship to proficiency levels, suggesting the need to re-examine Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental model that categorized all adverbial clauses into the same stage without considering their lexical associations related to subordinator use.

Figure 1. Frequencies of finite adverbial clauses.

The separate status of conditional and concessive clauses may come from their role as formal hedges in academic discourse (Hinkel, 2013; Hyland, 1994; Warchał, 2010). The hedging function of if clauses is to specify certain conditions under which the claims hold true as in Example (3), whereas the hedging although clauses indicate the limitations of specific arguments or facts as in Example (4). Although $i f$ clauses were frequently used in some lower-rated essays, most of them represented conversational uses of conditionals. Specifically, the if clauses typically found in the lower-rated essays were used when “making difficult moves hypothetical” as in Example (5) or “proposing others’ actions” as in Example (6) (Ford, 1997, pp. 399–401) to mitigate or hedge the intensity of interpersonally delicate actions of making negative comments or suggestions in conversational interaction.

(3) If we have any back up plans for the chaos then it’s okay to just ban physical punishment because we may still have some way to control students who behave bad. <High, file $1 7 4 6 >$   
(4) Although the development of army weapons has been achieved, still the number of military army takes great charge of the military forces. <High, file 2761>   
(5) If the world cannot keep valence, every animals, humans, plants will be die by world to keep the valance. <Low, file $2 6 3 1 > ^ { 5 }$   
(6) You teachers should understand them in your hearts, listen to their hurted minds if you want to be a good teacher and don’t want to punish your students. <Mid, file $1 9 1 3 >$

WH relative clauses (who, which, whom, whose) are clearly distinguished from other features in that only the midproficiency group used them significantly more than expected. This result supports the nature of complexity associated with WH relative clauses that are “mixed or intermediate on the two parameters” as finite clause types functioning as NP constituents (Biber et al., 2011, p. 27). Besides, the findings that these structures were used much less than expected in the low-rated essays and slightly less than expected in the high-rated essays may suggest that WH relatives might not yet be readily available to the low-proficiency group, whereas the high-proficiency group might have already passed the intermediate stage, favoring phrasal elaboration over clausal modification.

The intermediate stage of WH relative clauses is further supported by the observation that the mid-proficiency group often embedded relative clauses beginning with different relativizers in a single sentence as in Example (7). These patterns of use account for $1 1 . 4 \%$ of the occurrences of WH relatives in the mid-rated essays. However, such cases were not as often in the high-rated essays $( 3 . 9 \% )$ and non-existent in the low-rated essays, which suggests again that WH relatives were the most preferred means at intermediate levels to achieve structurally compressed NPs.

(7) I think that those who have religion which don’t let them use military force would be reconsidered and excluded from. <Mid, file 3077>

The proficiency-level differences were also quite evident in the lexical association patterns for finite complement clauses, although their overall frequency showed no statistically significant association with writing proficiency. Table 6 shows the top six most common controlling words in the three sets of writing. The notably frequent verbs in the low-rated essays were think and (dis)agree, accounting for $7 9 . 1 \%$ of the total controlling verbs. The heavy reliance on these two verbs demonstrates an extremely limited set of verbs taking that-clauses at beginning levels of development, and the students showed a greater variety and balance in lexical choices as proficiency increased.

In particular, the finding that controlling verbs insist and argue were more common in the high-rated essays $( 1 7 . 6 \% )$ than the mid-rated essays $( 9 . 7 \% )$ and relatively rare in the low-rated essays $( 2 . 3 \% )$ points to little genre awareness at lower levels given the importance of using “particular verbs more specific to the task of argumentation in writing” (Staple and Reppen, 2016, p. 18). These two verbs in the high-rated essays mostly co-occurred with 3rd person plural subjects as in Examples (8) and (9) to state opposing arguments on the issue rather than developing writers’ own views. Such combinations might serve to make readers with alternative opinions more open-minded and engage in the discussion by showing a fair degree of writers’ receptivity to opinions opposite to their own. In this regard, Examples (8) and (9) demonstrate the writers’ recognition of the rights of smokers or the cost of military duty, respectively, although these were arguments against their views. This balanced and interactive style of writing identified in the high-rated essays is comparable to the findings of previous studies that advanced writers tend to communicate their ideas in a less confrontational manner by giving the audience more leeway for disagreement, thereby resulting in a greater dialogic space for alternative viewpoints during interactions (Oh and Kang, 2013; White and Sano, 2006).

(8) Some smokers argue that the law that prohibit to smoke in public places is unnecessary and that its’ their rights to decide where they smoke. <High, file 2513>   
(9) They insist that spending almost two years in army is waste of time. <High, file $3 2 >$

Regarding noun complement clauses, the most employed head nouns in the high-rated essays were fact and idea, followed by opinion, problem, argument, possibility, and doubt $4 . 0 \%$ each). Similarly, fact was particularly featured in the mid-rated essays, followed by opinion, reason, news, and situation $8 . 6 \%$ each). The low-rated essays, however, were clearly distinguished from the other two sets of writing in the choice of head nouns. In the L2 writing domain, nouns taking that-clauses have been highlighted as cohesive devices for achieving textual coherence under different labels such as shell nouns and signalling nouns (e.g., Aktas and Cortes, 2008; Flowerdew, 2006; Jang and Rhee, 2014; Oh, 2014). Especially in the context of argumentative writing, these nouns can double as persuasive devices by reflecting the writer’s perspective on the content presented in the following that-clauses. As Wingate (2012) noted, “the analysis and evaluation of content knowledge” could be a basis for “developing an argument” (p. 146). The stance nouns of a writer’s choice could in turn affect “readers’ comprehension and interpretation of the complement information” thereby making them hold a particular view on the issue (Jiang, 2015, p. 92). While none of the head nouns found in the low-rated essays overlapped with stance nouns commonly used in academic prose such as fact, possibility, idea, and opinion (Biber et al., 1999; Larsen-Freeman and Celce-Murcia, 2016), the head nouns found in the mid- or high-rated essays quite corresponded to them. This alignment in the choice of head nouns suggests that the students at upper-intermediate levels started to acquire some generic conventions of academic writing on the use of noun complement clauses. However, the finding that the most frequent choices overall were fact, idea, and opinion indicates the predominance of pragmatically vague nouns across proficiency levels. As Jiang (2015) pointed out, unlike stance nouns such as argument and claim that express specific speech acts, those lacking illocutionary force commonly used by L2 writers could not help “formulate argumentation and extend the discussions and arguments further” (pp. 96–97). In sum, the qualitative review of controlling verbs and nouns taking that-clauses consistently demonstrated greater lexical diversity in the highly rated essays. Besides, comparing lexical choices made by each proficiency group showed the increasing use of academic controlling words as proficiency developed, but still suggested a need even for high-proficiency students to further enhance awareness of the argumentative genre and expand the associated lexical repertoire.

# 4.3.2. Phrasal complexity features

Prepositional phrases of contributed most to the association between L2 writing proficiency and grammatical complexity given their largest sum of absolute values of adjusted residuals among all the features examined. In other words, of phrases turned out to be the best discriminator for L2 writers, with the high-proficiency group using far more than expected while the low-proficiency group using much less than expected. Similarly, the low-proficiency group used much less prepositional phrases other than of than expected, while the high-proficiency group used them only moderately more than expected, displaying a different tendency from the case of of phrases. Besides showing frequent use of of phrases, Example (10) from a high-rated essay demonstrates how other phrasal modifiers are embedded in prepositional phrases to build more compressed NP structures. Specifically, prepositional phrases in this example include attributive adjective (i.e., medical, infectious), participial adjective (i.e., tested), or premodifying noun (i.e., drug); prepositional phrases are underlined with the head NPs in brackets; premodifying adjectives and nouns embedded in prepositional phrases are in bold.

(10) [Using animals] for the purpose of testing drugs is justifiable and necessary: animals do not have rights equal to [those] of humans, and even if they did, [using them] for medical experiments must be done for the greater good. [.] we would face dreadful consequences: child deformation, [spread] of infectious diseases, and even [extinction] of species. Among them, [the outbreak] of diseases, [the most likely result] of the production of lightly tested drugs, would not just affect humans. [.] For these reasons, [using animals] for drug experiments is not only the right thing to do, but also necessary. <High, file 2546>

Another interesting finding is that the students with high proficiency drew more on multiple prepositional phrases as nominal postmodifiers (1.6 instances per 1,000 words) than those with low-intermediate proficiency (0.8 instances per 1,000 words), though not by a massive margin. In Example (10) above, the two head NPs (i.e., using animal, the most likely result) are postmodified by two prepositional phrases. Far more compressed NPs containing three prepositional phrases emerged in the high-rated essays as in Example (11), while no such postmodification occurred in the mid- or low-rated essays. These findings are parallel to previous studies showing that NPs with multiple prepositional phrases represent highly advanced academic prose (Biber, 2006; Biber et al., 1999, 2011; Kim, 2020). Given that the essays examined in this study were produced by firstyear college students who had just started university courses, it is not surprising that multiple prepositional phrases exhibited no marked difference across proficiency levels, and that even the high-proficiency group did not appear to have reached the developmental level to use such structures productively.

(11) The abolition of the physical punishment of children in schools. <High, file 1437>

In contrast to of phrases, the frequencies of both adjectives and nouns as nominal premodifiers displayed less clear-cut differences across proficiency levels, but in different ways. More specifically, premodifying adjectives were used slightly more than expected in the low-rated essays but slightly less than expected in the high- or mid-rated essays. Conversely, premodifying nouns were used moderately more than expected in the high-rated essays but slightly less than expected in the low- or mid-rated essays. The qualitative review of student writing suggests possible reasons for these opposite outcomes: the effects of writing prompts on premodifying adjectives, and the function of the vocabulary range on premodifying nouns.

First, the observation of premdifying adjectives identified the great dependence on adjective-noun sequences presented in writing prompts (i.e., cellular phone, military service, real name, public building, medical experiment, physical punishment), especially at beginning levels of development. These six adjective-noun sequences account for a large majority of these constructions found in student writing: $3 2 . 5 \%$ of the total adjective-noun sequences in the high-rated essays, $3 6 . 4 \%$ in the mid-rated essays, and $4 6 . 3 \%$ in the low-rated essays. The largest proportion of the low-rated essays indicates the marked tendency for the less advanced writers to rely heavily on expressions presented in writing prompts and to continually recycle them, which could be the main reason for the small but positive adjusted residuals associated with the low-rated essays. In contrast, the advanced writers showed relatively diverse lexical realization of adjective-noun constructions as illustrated in Example (12). In this example, the writer utilized alternative expressions such as cell phone and mobile phone instead of recycling the expression presented in the writing prompt, cellular phone. Likewise, the writer showed a preference to use near synonyms rather than repeating identical words, as evidenced by the use of primary, main, and key or the use of deadly and serious. These observations confirm the finding of previous studies that lexical diversity is a distinctive feature of highly rated essays (e.g., Friginal et al., 2014; Reppen, 2001).

(12) First of all, cell phone use increases the incidence of deadly car accidents. Many people get injured or dead due to car accidents everyday. Prevention of these accidents should be a primary goal of our society. Using mobile phones while driving is the main cause of accidents because it makes hard for drivers to focus on traffic signs. [.] Although it seems too small to say cell phone use is a key factor of air pollution, the effect of reducing traffic congestion is huge. [.] Driving automobiles is convenient. However, if the drivers don’t concentrate, it can bring about serious accidents and environmental destruction. <High, file $3 0 9 0 >$

Second, the qualitative review on premodifying nouns found that the more proficient students made extensive use of a single topic-related noun to create several different noun–noun sequences. For instance, Example (13) from a high-rated essay on the topic of using animals in medical experiments showed the repeated use of the premodifying noun animal in phrases such as animal rights and animal experiments. Likewise, in Example (14) from a high-rated essay on the topic of using cellular phones while driving, the premodifying noun traffic was found in phrases such as traffic sign, traffic congestion, and traffic system. In addition, the phrases such as cell phone6 (use) and phone call were often used in the highly rated essays as a substitution for cellular phone as in Examples (14) and (15). The four phrases, namely, animal rights, animal experiments, cell phone, and phone call, accounted for $1 9 . 0 \%$ and $2 0 . 5 \%$ of the total noun–noun sequences in the mid- and high-rated essays, respectively, while none of these phrases were found in the low-rated essays. This suggests that the vocabulary size of the low-proficiency students was not yet large enough to productively use topical nouns within noun–noun constructions. In other words, the superior ability to leverage the topic-related vocabulary could be a reasonable explanation behind the small but positive adjusted residuals associated with the high-rated essays.

terms of the degree of influence that writing prompts had on their lexical realization and vocabulary size required to create diversity within these features.

# 5. Conclusions

This study sought to estimate the developmental trajectory of grammatical complexity in L2 writing by investigating the association between the use of complexity features and L2 writing proficiency. For this purpose, five clausal and four phrasal features from Biber et al.’s (2011) index were used to operate grammatical complexity in argumentative essays of Korean college students at three proficiency levels.

Returning to the research questions, this study demonstrated an association between the frequencies of clausal and phrasal complexity features and L2 writing proficiency. More importantly, the finding regarding the main contributors to the association confirmed the developmental sequence hypothesized by Biber et al. (2011) in the context of L2 writing, to the extent that finite adverbial clauses (Stage 2) were key features of the low-rated essays; WH relative clauses (Stage 3) were the most prominent complexity devices of the mid-rated essays; and of phrases as postmodifiers (Stages 3–5) best represented the complex styles of the high-rated essays. The observed developmental sequence showed a stepwise increase in complexity in terms of two parameters: structural form and syntactic function. Additionally, the findings of this study might provide evidence for potential L1 impacts on the use of complexity features, especially considering the different developmental patterns exhibited by L1 Chinese writers in Lan et al. (2019a) and the characteristics of Korean and Chinese languages that support each outcome.

The qualitative review of the lexical associations of each grammatical feature provides additional insights into developmental differences. Even for complexity features that showed no significant association with L2 writing proficiency based on quantitative findings, more proficient students could be distinguished in terms of lexical diversity and academically oriented lexical choices within these grammatical structures. This suggests that grammatical features are inextricably connected and should be considered together with their lexical realization.

Despite the contribution to a deeper understanding of the development of grammatical complexity in L2 writing, this study is subject to three main limitations. First, the potential influence of writing topics on the use of complexity features was not controlled. The inability to selectively extract essays in consideration of writing topics can be attributed to the extremely limited number of texts in the advanced levels C1 and C2. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, all texts from these two levels had to be included. Thus, future research on L2 complexity development should be conducted while taking writing topics into consideration to elucidate more reliable developmental patterns of grammatical complexity. Second, this study did not undertake a full evaluation of POS tagging accuracy due to practical constraints. Nonetheless, concerns regarding tag accuracy were partially alleviated by considering the systematic patterns of tagging errors observed in 30 writing samples and prioritizing recall over precision when constructing relevant regex. Third, written production with a specific time limit, as employed in this study, might not elicit heavy nominal groups and fail to fully reflect individual grammatical proficiency, reducing the gap between developmentally more advanced and less advanced students in terms of the kinds and degree of complexity (Ellis and Yuan, 2004; Lu, 2011). Thus, future studies on untimed academic writing may provide a more precise evaluation of complexity associated with different developmental levels.

# 6. Pedagogical implications

The findings of this study provide valuable insights for evaluating writing proficiency and tailoring writing courses to facilitate the development of formal academic writing skills. First, the empirically derived developmental stages for complexity features in this study may help develop more detailed rating scale descriptors for grammatical complexity of L2 writers’ performance by explicitly defining prominent grammatical structures displayed by L2 writers at a certain level of development (Knoch, 2009). Grammatical features in L2 writing constitute a principal dimension that determines L2 writers’ proficiency (Cumming and Mellow, 1996; McNamara, 1990). Nonetheless, the scoring descriptors for grammatical features have been rather comprehensive and vague (Becker, 2018; Lumley, 2002). To illustrate, the four rating levels for grammatical complexity in Jacobs et al.’s (1981) ESL Composition Profile, which has been widely used to assess writing proficiency levels of EFL/ESL students, are distinguished using a few descriptive words associated with sentence constructions, such as simple, complex, and effective. This lack of specificity can lead to varying interpretations of scale contents, resulting in inconsistencies in raters’ judgments. Furthermore, evaluating the genre-appropriate or functionally effective use of grammatical structures becomes challenging when scale descriptors do not reflect the types of complexity typically found in a specific register. To address these problems at least partially, the findings of this study regarding the relationship between L2 writing proficiency levels and salient complexity devices at each level can be used to develop more explicit rating scale descriptors that render raters’ judgments more consistent and valid in the context of academic writing.

Second, the effect of L2 instruction can be heightened by encouraging learners to consciously attend to and engage in thorough and reflective analysis of specific grammatical features selected according to learners’ developmental stages. The need for focused instructional treatments draws on the two findings of research synthesis and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of L2 instruction: first, explicit types of treatment showed larger effect sizes than implicit type treatments, and second, the effects were even durable (Norris and Ortega, 2001). One way of providing focused instruction on grammatical features is using consciousness-raising activities designed to “develop an awareness of the form, meaning, and use of complex nominal groups at the level of explicit knowledge” (Musgrave and Parkinson, 2014, p. 154). To illustrate, learners can be required to compare writings from low- with high-proficiency groups or writings from student writers with professionals and then identify the differences in grammatical structures at clausal and phrasal levels. For example, the comparison demonstrates how the information conveyed using relative clauses in the lower-rated essays (e.g., .other people who is innocent, . freedom that smokers have) is presented more concisely in the higher-rated essays through the use of phrasal structures such as attributive adjectives (e.g., .other innocent people) or of phrases (e.g.,.freedom of smokers).

Additionally, classroom focus on the academically oriented lexical realizations of grammatical structures may be of value for advanced as well as less advanced students. This is particularly the case for the choice of controlling nouns and verbs taking that complement clauses, given the finding of this study that the controlling words even in highly rated essays were very limited and largely reflected conversational norms. Thus, it is important to afford learners opportunities to heighten their awareness of academic register and expand their lexical repertoire pertinent to such register. To accomplish this, comparing the high frequency words controlling that-clauses in student writing and advanced academic prose may allow students to notice the differences and equip themselves with a wide selection of academic controlling words. Such exposure might help students inductively capture the characteristics typical and atypical of academic writing and become familiar with targeted lexico-grammatical patterns.

Note. FAC $=$ Finite adverbial clauses, VAC $=$ Verb/adjective complement clauses, $\mathsf { N C = }$ Noun complement clauses, TRC $=$ That relative clauses, WRC WH relative clauses, $\mathrm { P A } =$ Premodifying adjectives, $\mathrm { P N } =$ Premodifying nouns, PP of $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } }$ Prepositional phrases of, $\mathrm { P P = }$ Prepositional phrases other than of. Obs means the observed count; Exp means the expected count; and Adj means the adjusted residuals. Exp of a cell is computed as (raw total $^ *$ column total)/ grand total (McHugh, 2013).
