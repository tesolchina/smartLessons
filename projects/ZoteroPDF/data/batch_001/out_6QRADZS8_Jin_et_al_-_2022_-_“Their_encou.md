Keywords:   
Peer effect   
Learner engagement   
Collaborative reading   
Academic reading

Although it has been well noted that peer interaction can affect language learning outcomes, how it specifically impacts the learning process in group reading tasks remains underexplored. This article reports on a longitudinal case study, examining how peer interactions influence the engagement of five first-year university students in collaborative academic reading tasks and tracing the changes of peer effects on learner engagement over one academic semester. Data from multiple sources were collected, including audiotaped recordings of group discussions, peer feedback forms, and semi-structured interviews. The findings suggest that peers exerted influences on learners' behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional engagement in the collaborative academic reading tasks. Throughout the semester, the participants demonstrated a developmental change of peer effects on different dimensions of their peers' engagement, veering their influence on each other from behavioral engagement to cognitive engagement and social engagement. Peer effects on each other's emotional engagement remained stable. This study identifies that students' metacognitive knowledge, familiarity with group members, and leadership play a critical role in shaping learner engagement. The findings provide important insights for researchers and teachers on the connection of students' peer influence with learning process in collaborative learning tasks.

# 1. Introduction

Content comprehension has been a challenge for second language (L2) learners, many of whom have reported difficulties in reading academic texts after entering higher education (Ohata & Fukao, 2014). Comprehension of academic texts may be compromised by "unfamiliarity with the discursive conventions of academic writing" limited "domain-specific vocabulary" or " lack of prior content knowledge" (McGrath et al., 2016, p. 153). As a result, many language learners may find it ifficult to \*convert their word-reading skill int comprehension'" (Snow, 2010, p. 450) when they are confronted with academic text, and may fel inept or become less willing to obtain information from texts.

Research has shown that collborative reading can efectively engage students into text-based tasks and facilitate their understanding of texts through collaboration in small groups (Boardman et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2020), which serves one way to empower university students to enhance their academic reading comprehension. In the group learning context where peer interaction is ubiquitous, classroom participation is significantly shaped and regulated by their peers. Peer groups \*can serve as an important source of information and motivation" and \*enable discourse among students" (Gottried, 2014,p. 608) thus helping learners process new information and generate different perspectives.

Strong peer ffects have been discovered by previous research on learner engagement in the language larning proces (e.g., Fan & Xu, 2020; Sato & Viveros, 2016). Despite the reported influence on language learner engagement, there is ittle research on how learner engagement i specificall influenced and shaped by peers over aprolonged period of time in a collaborative reading context. Drawing on multiple sources of data, the present article reports a qualitative study of peer efects on five first-year students' task engagement in collaborative reading of academic texts and the trajectory of the per effcts in an EAP course throughout a semester in a Chinese major universty. This study sheds light on how learner engagement can be affected through peer interactions by examining the ways and means through which learners influence each other in classroom activities adding to current knowledge on language learning patterns, and providing insights on task-based language teaching design.

# 1.1. Peer effects in learning context

In collaborative learning, learners are put in an environment where \*various learner-internal cognitive and affective variables continually interact in an integrative manner (Poupore, 2015, p. 721). The composition of gouped peers, therefore, plays a signif. icant role in influencing students' learning behaviors and outcomes. As Dornyei and Murphey (2003) stated, "group dynamics is probably one of the most - if not the most - useful subdisciplines in the social sciences for language teachers (p. 1). Atkins-Burnett et a.(2017) concetlizd pe effts as the effts on students learning that are mediad though intractions with ther leaners within the same group and among diffrent groups. According to Sacerdote (2011), peer efects include \*nearly any externalit in which peers' backgrounds, current behavior, or outcomes affect an outcome' (p. 250). That is, per effects may function through a variety of channels, encompassing the influence of both peers' real-time behaviors and their learning outcomes on each other. For instance, one student's high proficiency may inspire peers in the same group to work harder to catch up; also, students may gain knowledge from their peers' answers to the questions in class..

Peer effects in class can be direct (e.g., benefiting from a peer's tutoring) or indirect (e.g., being affcted by a peers attitud, interest, etc.), impacting students' learning behaviors and outcomes. Early studies in education have largely examined pee effects on students classroom lerning outcomes and social actvities. Sacerdote (2001) uncovered the effct of students decisions to join social groups on their peer's course grades. Brunello et al. (2010) surveyed how students grades were influenced by their peers enrolled in the same courses. Recently, per effects have been explored through a wider lens, including the role of learning context on peers interactional bhaviors (., Sat  Storch, 2022), as well a pers inluences on each thers dcision making such as the witching of majors (e.g., Pu et al., 2021) and occupational preferences (e.g., Jones & Kofoed, 2020).

The significance of peer effects on language learning has been researched extensively, highlighting the importance of language learning mediated through interactions with peers. Justice et al. (2011) investigated the relationship between children's overall language growth and their clssmates' skill, addressing peer efects on young learners language skill in terms f expressive vocabulary, word structures, and sentence structures, especially among learners with relatively low proficiency. In university language classrooms where students are often organized into groups to accomplish tass and provided with more opportunities to speak to each other to construct meanings (Mayo & Azkarai, 2016) learning outcomes are to a large extent shaped by group interaction. McDonough et al. (2016) found that collaborative writing tasks promoted English as a foreign language (EFL) students' talk and text quality, eliciting more group discussion of content, organization, and language than individual tasks, indicating the facilitating role of per's influence on each other's language proficiency. Fujiiet al. (2016) examined the effects of metacognitive instruction on interactional feedback in learner-learner interactions in EFL speaking tasks, emphasizing the use of prs' interactional feedback on learners' task performance and language acquisition.

# 1.2. Learner engagement

Engagement generall refers to a state of heightened attention and involvement, where participation is reflected (Philp & Duch. esne, 2016). Researchers have found that students are optimally engaged when they are focused, persistent, on-task, challenged, interested and involved (Christenson et al., 2012; Khajavy, 2021). In the previous literature, engagement is frequently conceptualized as a multidimensional construct that encompasses three distinct and interrelated constructs, namely, behavioral engagement, cognitive engagement, and emotional (affctive) engagement (Fredricks et al., 2004). Behavioral engagement refers to \*the amount and quality of learners active participation in learnng" cognitive engagement rfersto learnrs mental efort and mental activity in the processof lening"; and motional engagement refers to leaners \*affeted reactions as they participat in target anguage related activities or tasks" (Hiver, Al-Horie, Vitt, et al., 2021, p. 4-5). Furthermore, Philp and Duchesne (2016) foregrounded social engagement as another dimension, emphasizing peers support, benefit and reciprocity with each other through their interaction. Engagement is context-deendent, object-oriented, and dynamic (Hiver, Al-Hoorie, Vitta, et a., 2021); with different contextual and intrapersonal conditions, the trajectory of engagement veers toward different directions (Jang et al., 2016).

Engagement is esential for fruitful learning (Hiver, Al-Hoorie, & Mercer, 2021). Researchers have conducted empirical studies on measuring engagement and discovered a link between leaner engagement and their positive outcomes (e.g., Bergdahl et a., 2020. Meanwhile, prior studies have found that engagement can help predict students academic achievement and succes; students who are more engaged tend to have more satisfying test results and achieve higher grades (Reschly & Christenson, 2012).

In particular, a reciprocal relationship has been revealed betwen reading and engagement. While engagement impacts students reading ability, their reading experience in tun influences their lassroom engagement. As highly motivated students are apt to feel more engaged, clasroom reading activitie increase active readers' need satisfaction, and therefore boost their engagement Jang et al., 2016). Furthermore, researchers have found positive outcomes from active reading engagement. For example, L1 readers who are fully engaged in the reading materials gain more knowledge than disengaged readers, which helps them construct meanings from texts and stay socially interactive in reading tas (Ivey & Johnston, 2013). In EFL setigs, engagement influences learners' attitude, turning their words into deeds (Oga-Baldwin, 2019), enhancing their wilingness toward schoolwork and priming students towards future action (Oga-Baldwin & Nakata, 2017), playing a key role in shaping relationship and language learning environment (Sulis & Philp, 2021).

# 1.3. Peer effects on learner engagement in collaborative reading

Collaborative reading has been regarded as an effective approach to facilitate students' learning. Collborative Strategic Reading (CSR) is a reading comprehension instructional practice that combines cooperative learning and reading comprehension strategies (e. 8., Klingner & Vaughn, 200). Researchers have developed specific teaching methods in accordance with various contexts and intentions based on the CSR model (e.g., Jin et al., 2020; Zoghi et al., 2010), which aimed at eiciting language learners' strategies in collaboration and facilitating their reading comprehension of difficult texts.

Researchers have invested much enthusiasm in investigating EFL learners' engagement in collaborative reading. Sulis and Philp (2021) found reciprocal interconnections between positive peer collaboration and learner engagement. That is, a friendly and non-judgmental peer relationship in class contributes to students' more active participation and helps them speak up in class more confidently and proactively, i.e., promoting leaners behavioral engagement. Fukuda et al. (2021) found that collaborative reading facilitates students cognitive and emotional engagement and helps them co-construct knowledge with peers. Specifically,collaboration helps build a communit of practice among learners, alowing them to apply their expertise to support each other with "peer-tested ideas", and thus ringing about students co-development of anguage kills (Fukuda et al., 2021, p. 246). However, most studies investigating the inflence of per effects on learner engagement have ben conducted in an individual learning context (e., Reichenberg, 2018; Sedacek & Sedova, 2020; Vollt et a., 2017); in contrast, the question of how laner engagement is influenced by peers in a collaborative reading context has been underexplored. Given the elusive nature of collaborative learning, an attempt to explore the role of peer efects on students' engagement i collaborative reading can contribut to current knowledge on the mechanism of group work, providing both theoretical and pedagogical implications on classroom design and language learning.

# 2. Present study

As summarized above, previous research has reported the importance of peer effcts, with most studies focusing on their direct influence on learning outcomes (e.g., Black et al., 2013). Although recent language education has highlighted the facilitating role of peer collaboration in boosting actie learner egagment, how the ltter i specificall influenced by per in acollaborative reading context remains underexplored. Peers can affct the natureof socialization process and shape each other's engagement within the group in acollaborative learning context (Leeming, 2021; Ryan, 200) which subsequently determines their learning outcome (Hattie, 2012). Thus, it isnecessay to comprehend the nature of peer ffect on leaner engagement, as wel as to cature it rel-time change. The present study therefore explores peer effcts on learner engagement in collaborative reading tasks and examines the potential changes of their engagement over a period of time. The findings will provide implications for language teachers to design class activities and for students to obtain more efective peer support and hence benefit more from collaborative reading. In specific, the following two questions guide this study:

1. In what ways do peers affect learner engagement in collaborative reading of academic texts?   
2. How do peer effects on learner engagement change over time?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Context and participants

This study was conducted in an 18-week EAP course at a comprehensive universty in China. The enrolled students were twenty nine freshmen majoring in electronics and information technology, who demonstrated comparatively high English proficiency in a placement test. These students were split up into groups of four or five for maximum clas productivity (Wheelan, 2009). The "three-stage teaching method\* (Jin et al, 2020; Liu et al., 2021) was adopted for the course, including individual reading, group discussion and group presentation. A leader was nominated by the group members, in order to promote group work. In each task students were required to read an academic article, summarize its key information and then produce a 2-min oral presentation on the main idea of the text. To address the two research questions, ths study focused on a five-student group to build an in-depth understanding of how peer affected learner engagement in collaborative reading. The focus group was selected because of group members widely different partipation in the collaboration task, with a powerful goup leader, two active collaborators, and two ilent lerners. All participants were native Chinese speakers who learned English as their foreign language, their English proficiency roughly equivalent to CEFR B2 level, competent for understanding, interacting and producing texs on a wide range f subjects in English. None of these participants reported on any in-clas collaborative English learning experience prior to this course. The participants' background information is listed in Table 1.

Throughout the semester, students were asked to read five academic articles according to the course schedule. Each article was approximately 2,000 words in length, and divided into three sections, namely, \*inroduction', \*elaboration" and "solution'. Annotations of difficult vocabulary items were added to help students comprehend the article.

The classroom activities during a collaborative reading task are shown in Table 2. Students were given 2 min for a brief preview of the articles and a layout of the division of labor, before reading the article individually for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ . After individual reading, students were required to start 10-min group discussion to co-construct the is of the text. They were encouraged to share their information and understanding with each other based on what they had read. Students were then given 5 min to formulate an outline of the main idea of the text and write the outline on the blackboard, after which one member from each group was selected randomly to give a 2- min presentation summarizing the main idea of the text based on the outline and his/her understanding of the text. Students were required to asses their peers' performance with the peer feedback form and write some suggestions to the presenters. Extra marks would be given to the group in which the presenter had the highest score from their peers' feedback, as well s to the group with the best suggestion.

# 3.2. Data collection

This study adopted a qualitative case study approach for a thick description on how grouped learners influence each other's engagement. Following Atkins-Burnet et al.'s (2017) definition, in this study, peer effcts included both intr-group and inter-group peer effects. We adapted Hiver, AlHoorie, Vitta, et al's (2021) definition and used behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and social engagement as the four integral dimensions of learner engagement in class.

Collaborative reading tass were assigned in Week 3, 6, 11, 14, and 17 of the semester. Data collction strted at Week 3, afer two wees of classroom observation. Data sources included audiotaped recordings of reading activitie, peer feedback forms, and semistructured interviews (see Table 3). The multiple data sources provided data triangulation in addressing the research questions.

Audiotaped recordings. In order to answer the two research questions, it was necessary to observe and analyze students' in. teractions and engagement in class All participants' activities during the course were audio recorded throughout the semester, including their reading of the text, group discussions and group presentations. Since group members interacted mostly in Chinese, the transcripts of the recording were translated into English and segmented into talk turns.

Peer feedback forms. Each group received five peer feedback forms, and was required to score the oral presentations of the other five groups and give suggestions for improvement. The presenters would receive this feedback from other groups in the next week. The feedback forms that the focus-group presenters received were collected as a resource of inter-group peer effect.

Semi-structured interviews. Two rounds of semi-structured individual interviews with the five participants were conducted sequentily in Week 9 and atthe end of the semester, the 9-week interval of which helped capture the change of peer ffects on learner engagement throughout the semester. Each interview lasted about $4 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . Background information such as the participants' age, L2 background and gender was collcted in the interview. Students were asked about hir participation in collaborative reading tasks in different phases, with the focus on the participants' behaviors, cognitions, social interactions, and emotions.

# 3.3. Data analysis

To address the two research questions, we transcribed and coded the recordings of classroom discussions and interviews. Informed consent that allthe data collected would be used only for research purposes and no privacy would be disclosed was obtained from all participants. We analyzed the peer feedback forms that the participants received with a focus on the qualitative suggestions. The recordings of classroom discussions were transcribed. This study adopted an inductive approach, and developed the coding scheme from both previous literature and the current classrom design (Jin et al., 2020; Hiver, AlHoorie Vitta, et al., 2021. See Table 4 for more detail). The content of transcriptions was double checked with another research asstant until fl agrement was reached. before translated into English and arranged into talk tuns. The tuns wre further categorized into dfrent epiode, each focusing on group members' discussion of a specific content in class. We first observed specific manifestations of learner engagement, before identifying peer efects on leaner engagement within and between episodes as well as their trajectorie. emi-structured interviews provided us with in-depth knowledge on peer efects on learner engagement as wellas evidence of the changes of peer effcts on learner engagement throughout the semester. Per feedback forms helped us pinpoint prs influence on the participants engagement

in group presentation tasks more accurately.

# 4. Findings

The participants were found to perform the tass in action as requested, monitor each other's behavior, stay socially supportive to their per, and display a variety of emotions, affcting their peers engagement throughout the reading tass. Throughout the semester, the participants progressed from exerting greater influence on each other behavioraly to putting more emphasis on each other's engagement cognitively and socially. Participants inluence on each other's emotional engagement remained consistently stable.

# 4.1. Peer effects on learner engagement

# 4.1.1. Peer effects on behavioral engagement

Behaviorall, leaners exerted influence on each other on both planning and executing the tasks. In the following example of group discusson on labor division (Table 5), the group leader (Bruce) took up the leading role in labor division when the group members hesitated on which part of the article to read.

In this episode, Bruce went straight to the task and guided the group discussion on labor division when Zach and Evelyn finished reading the tles i different part of the article (Turn 3, 4 and 5). Bruce, who had taken the order, kept Evelyn informed and on-task $\mathrm { T u r n } \ 6$ and 7), progressing the reading activity, keeping pers' learning behavior on track. Under his guidance, the group divided labor collaboratively, with members prompting each other on the given labor (Turn 8 and 9).

# 4.1.2. Peer effects on cognitive engagement

Cognitively, the learners influenced one another specifically around outline prearation and oral presentation activities promoting one another's strategic use in tasks. For instance, in the oral presentation activity,athough each participant was invited on stage to give presentations randomly, the total numbers of each person getting on stage would be equalized throughout the semester to ensure an equal opportunity for every student. Therefore, by excluding the members who had given presentations in the past few weeks, the group would send the member who would most likely be invited in the current week up to the stage and let him/her draw the outline for a better preparation of language use and speech delivery, as Bruce described:

We would send the person who predicted that he/she would be the presenter and let him/her write (the outline) on the blackboard. Because that person would be clearer about the information on the board if it was written all by himself/herself. And, if we were not sure who the presenter would be, we would simply send the person whose comprehension of the text was the most comprehensive and profound. Because in this way the presenter would follow a clear and ordered structure.

(Bruce, Interview 1)

In the oral presentation activity, four of the five participants in the focus group mentioned in the interviews that they would pay specialatttion  their pers rtion skill and ln from thir stregthso improve ther ow pretion kills. or instance. as one of the best presenters in the group, Evelyn noted that she would take notice of the presentations performed by peers both within and outside the group, during which she manifested a set of metacognitive skills:

I would observe them give presentations and try to find out their unique strengths to learn from. For example, I noticed that Bruce liked to interact with the audience by throwing questions to them. Before he got on stage, he would have already formed a well-structured speech and a wellorganized layout of his presentation. That's why he could get high scores. I noticed that presenters who interacted more frequently with the audience would be scored more highly.

(Evelyn, Interview 2)

# 4.1.3. Peer effects on social engagement

Social engagement, unlike the previous dimensions, is often integrated with the other three branches of engagement in collaborative reading tass, where group members actively asked and answered each other's questions, elaborated and clarified the key concepts, built on each others ideas, and took notice of each other' feelings. As Table 6 shows, Evelyn raised a question about the pieces of text that seemed confusing to her during group discussions (Turn 1). The following response from peers (Turn 2 to Turn 6) helped co-construct meanings of the text and formulate the outline, in which social engagement (peers sharing each other's ideas to support Evelyn) intertwined with cognitive engagement (peers helping with Evelyn's comprehension of ideas).

The frequent exchange of ideas in groups enabled the students to nurture a close social relationship with each other. Zach, for instance, would ask teammates for support on the content of the article before giving presentations, by which both his relationship with peers and his comprehension of text were enhanced, helping him cope with the collaborative tasks:

Our group's acquaintance and communications ensured our succes in collaborative tasks .. When I come to the stage to give a presentation, I might ask the team member about the overall logic of the article, because feel that it's better that I sort out the points argued in the article and understand the logical relationship throughout the article before the presentation, by which I might speaking a little more smoothly.

(Zach, Interview 2)

# 4.1.4. Peer effects on emotional engagement

In terms of emotional engagement, the participants adjusted their emotions in the collaborative tass under their peers' guidance and influence. Table 7 is an episode where Monica, affcted by group members positive reactions to the reading task, underwent an

emotional change and successfully restrained her reluctance to reading the text.

It i alsofound that peers would intentionally give each other warm comments and feedback, which was reported to be helpful in evoking group members positive felings towards such task, especially those with high anxiety during the presentation. Table i the feedback from Evelyn after Monica finished her presentation.

Comforting comments such as these provided positive fedback while also helping to alleviate the stress of giving formal pre sentations. In an interview, Monica noted that the feedback and encouragement from her peers ater her presentations elevated her optimism and facilitated her confidence to present on stage.

They would encourage me by saying that I'd done a good job (performing on stage) . I think that their encouragement makes me feel more confident the next time I give presentations. That is, because of their aprovals, I become more confident and less nervous the next time I go give presentations on stage.

(Monica, Interview 2)

# 4.2. Change of peer effects on learner engagement over time

The analysis revealed how the participants engagement changed over time as afected by peers in this semester-long EAP course. In the early stage of the semester, the participants exerted great influence on ther pers engagement in the behavioral dimension, paying more atention to ensuring group members participation in the task. In the later stage, the participants showed more significant signs of influence on their peers' cognitive engagement and social engagement in reading tasks, increasing each other's focus on task and strategy use, providing feedback and support for one another. Throughout the course, al the participants maintained a positive influence on each other's emotional engagement, which ensured peers' active participation in the tasks.

# 4.2.1. Change of peer effects on behavioral engagement

Behaviorally, the participants' interactions became briefer and more concise throughout the semester. The words and talk turns in ,roup communications can reveal the overall change of the participants' behavioral engagement, as Table 9 shows.

As can be sen, while the participants' talk tuns remained relatively stable in the five tasks, a decrease in the overall words in aas. can be noticed, with the exceptions in Week 6 (112 turns), where group members came across many unfamiliar words, and Week 1 (2,440 words), where Zach offered an exhaustive explanation of a key concept that was unfamiliar to the other members

One significant change in behavioral engagement was in the labor division activity. The participants interactions on labor division were lengthy at the begining of the semester, as is shown in Table 5 which presents their tlk turns in dividing labors in Week 3. In Week 17, however, the participants carried on the reading task with a much shorter interaction in labor division (Table 10).

Instead of wandering around in the text, group members went straight to labor division in later tasks, improving the efficiency of collaborative reading. In Bruce's opinion, the decrease of interaction in labor division resulted from his increasing familiarity with group members' reading proficiency and their understanding of each other's behavioral pattern in class:

It is important to divide the labor appropriately, especially at the beginning of the semester because I need to consider everyone's reading proficiency and assgn the task in accordance, and .. I think the exchange of information in our groups is frequent. We talk not only about our academic performance, but also about our daily life. As we maintain close contact with each other, we become clearer about each other's thoughts. The after-class communications improved our in-class communications.

4.2.2. Change of peer effects on cognitive engagement

In the later stage of the semester, participants laid more emphasis on their peers' cognitive engagement in class including monitoring and improving each other's atention and strategy use i collaborative reading tass In the interviews, Bruce mentioned that he started to pay attention to the presenters' strategy use when preparing outlines for presentations.

Now when drafting an outline, I often remind my groupmates of some general instructions. For example, I think they can draft the outline more briefly with some omissions, because our time is limited. Our presentations need to be properly detailed and concise, with a conclusion at the end so that our audience can review the text.

(Bruce, Interview 1)

Levi, as the most quiet group member, was found to be significantly afected by his pers in terms of cognitive engagement. In the irst interview, Levi said it was difficult for him to give the presentation properly:

It i hard to deliver the main ideas to the audience logicall in the presentation and let the audience understand the information and comprehend both the logic of the article and the author's stance. Also, t's hard for me to find the correct words to organize the presentation. I'm not very used to it ... It's really hard.

(Levi, Interview 1)

3ward the end of the semester, however, Levi showed his progress in his cognitive engagement in giving presentations:

If the outline was written by another group member, he/she would tell us what he/she thought was the best way for me to reveal the information . One benefit of the presentation is that I am aware that I should highlight my own point when presenting, and avoid talking too much without a focus.

(Levi, Interview 2)

# 4.2.3. Change of peer effects on social engagement

Socill, the participants became incrsingly bound in their relationships with each other. They gradually developed their sense of group collboration awareness' throughout the tasks and enhanced their social engagement. As Bruce noted, the frequent group communications brought them closer, enabling constant new insights on tasks, and a supportive relationship with each other:

The expression and exchange of views in our group has become much smoother. Ithink there are two reasons for this. The first is that everyone has given more considerations to groupwork, and so everyone's communication skills have greatly improved. Also, many of our team members' ideas had large impacts on me. The ways they think in the exchanges of opinions generated a lot of new ideas for me.

(Bruce, Interview 2)

The co-construction of meaning usually started with a group member putting forward an idea or a thought. Within the focus group, such initiatives were oten taken by Evelyn. Despite not being the nominated leader of the group, when other group members could not come up with new ideas, Evelyn would raise a question or make a comment, which elicited group discussion. When asked about her active participation, Evelyn commented that the driving force of her social interactions with other group members came from the fierce competition between groups:

In group discussions I think I'm playing the role of a leader. Now I would read the long and dificult parts of the text more carefully and give specific feedbacks, which accurately express my views on articles instead of talking about my feelings about it ... Th competition between groups made me anxious, so I took the initiative and participated actively and drive other members who appeared les active. I would put forward my opinions and see f there was anyone who held different opinions.

(Evelyn, Interview 2)

# 4.2.4. Change of peer effects on emotional engagement

Emotionall, the participants maintained support of one other throughout the semester. In Week 6, Evelyn expressed her acute nervousness after giving the presentation (Table 11).

Despite her nervousness during the presentation in earlier tasks, Evelyn became more relieved upon receiving per's fedback commenting that the feedback nd comfor from her prs, although ot making her preentation any beter, heled her fee a lot more relieved. She concluded that she has become more confident when giving presentations:

Table 11 Episode 6. (Oral presentation in Week 6).   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Talk turn</td><td>Group member</td><td>Transcript</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Evelyn</td><td>My hands are shaking ... Ah ... [voice trembling].</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td> Monica</td><td>You&#x27;ve done a great job. I watched the previous presentations. You did a great job.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Evelyn</td><td>My hands are shaking ... Ah ....</td></tr></table></body></html>

I still fel nervous, but now I would act more relaxedly. In earlier presentations I tried to memorize every key sentence in the article, but now I'm confident enough to establish a logical connection between the key points. All I needed to do was to get familiar with the overall idea of the text.

(Evelyn, Interview 2)

# 5. Discussion

This study demonstrates how a group of five first-year university students, as novice learners of academic English, inluenced and were influenced by pers on their engagement i collaborative reading tasks. In contrast t previous reearch (e.g., Daley et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2016) which focused on the quantitative change of learner engagement, this study reveals the ubiquitous role of learners effect on their peers behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional engagement in accomplishing collaborative reading tasks. This study also unveils the changes of these influences throughout a semester'scourse, which involves an ongoing interaction of learners metacognitive kills to construct knowledge anddevelop collaborative skill to work with their pers. In particular, the indings add to the existing knowledge of language learners' engagement by revealing that the grouped participants made labor division of the aademic reding task to facilitate their understanding of the text, engaged themselves in peer learning i the processof co-constructing the meaning of the text, provided support to peers, and demonstrated a variety of emotions towards the tasks.

One critical finding of the study is that whil the manifestations of peer effects were ubiquitous throughout the collaborative reading tasks, the participants were found to exert influence on their peers' engagement emphatically in different stages of the tasks. The mutualinfluence on behavioral engagement ocrred when sharing the information of the texts with thir pers; they were most likely to affct the peers cognitive engagement when rearing the outlines and lerning from others preentations; their influence on each other's emotional engagement was manifested in more individual tas such as text reading and group presentation. In contrast, peers' influence on each other's social engagement is found pervasively throughout the collaborative tasks, co-existing with other aspects of peer ffets. Longidinally, the participants showed gat sigs of pe effcts on group members ehavioral egagment in the early stage of the semester, which dwindled in the later stage of the semester; their influence on each other's cognitive and social engagement became more prominent toward the end of the semester; their impacts on emotional engagement remained stable throughout the tasks.

The participants were found to develop coping strategies to challenges in the reading tass during the processof providing and receiving peer feedback and support The identified obstacles include: Monica showed signs of nervousness and lack of confidence when faced with the difficult reading materials in earl tasks; Evelyn has been struggling to comprehend the text; Levi encountered difficultie organizing the oral presentation. However, by sharing their thoughts, experiences, and felings with each other, they coconstructed meanings, learned from their experience and monitored each other's participation, forming their unique behavioral pattern in the group environment in later tasks. This echoes previous research that peer ffects are largely driven by enhanced group interaction (Feld & Zolitz, 2017), highlighting the positive impact of increased group communication on learner engagement.

It is also found that per effcts on learner engagement changed over time. As shown in the study, the participants per effects on behavioral engagement predominated in early tasks; in the later classes, the influences on behavioral engagement decreased, while cognitive and social engagement increased; nevertheles, they maintained a moderate influence for each other's emotional engagement throughout the semester. The early dominance of peer effct on behavioral engagement may be in virtue of the participants gradual adaption of a new learning pattrn. Because none of the participants had had any group learning experience before, they had to search for a new behavioral pattern in class which was both in compliance with the classoom process and the interactional pattern between themselves and peers, which in tun pushed them to engage themseles into what to do in the task, how to do the task, and in what order.

As the participants became more familiar with the clasroom procedures and peers behavior, lesstime was needed to start the task, making possble for a more sharpened focus on the completion of collaborative reading tass and higher eficiency for conducting in-depth learning. They initiated to influence their peers' cognitie engagement through promoting strategy use in tasks, activating various forms of pers' metacognitive knowledge, which in turn facilitated their cognitive engagement development and added to more frequent and profound peer effcts on cognitive engagement. For example, strategy use was developed when Bruce provided advice and suggestions about outline preparation. Such beneficial experiences enriched the members metacognitie knowledge about the positive influence of peer ffects on cognitive and social engagement, which in turn made them more wiling to instruct thir peers on presentation skill. This example gives evidence to the interactive and reciprocal relationship between per effects and group members' engagement, which explains the upward trend of peer efects on cognitive and social engagement in later tasks. Moreover, the participants kept in touch with their peers on campus and in online chat groups fter class, which created a harmonious group environment. As Bruce noted, the pleasant atmosphere in their group was largely due to their communication after cass, by which the participants consolidated their sense of community, enabling them to offr rich and consistent support to each other. This extends previous findings on the nature and facilitation of learner autonomy, which involves off-task group communications (e.g., Borg & Alshumaimeri, 2019). Throughout the course, the group members showed their consistency and solidarity in terms of the influence on each other's emotional engagement. The group members kept monitoring each other's task behavior and performance, adjusting their attitudes toward the tasks. Moreover, as Section 4.2.4 indicates, group members inluence on each other's social engagement worked as a strong mediator to their emotions. Although they became increasingly familiar with the task pattern, the participants friendy relationships ensured that they were never tired of encouraging and comforting each other, maintaining pers positive emotional engagement.

In line with previous research on peer collaboration (e.g, Leman, 2015), this study identified two prerequisites that played an important role for group members in exerting influence on each other's behavioral engagement a the labor division assgned by a member who took the leading role, and b) the active participation of team members to which the metacognitive knowledge contributed. As the findings suggest, the participants intentionally employed strategies and self-regulations (e.g., dividing the labor, self-reflection on language, watchfulnes on peers mental state) to improve themselves and lead the group toward accomplishments of collaborative AP reding tass. Bruce's enormous influence on his pees behavioral and cognitiveengagement, for instance reflected his leadership within the group, which stemmed from his metacognition about his in-group identity and the group dynamics. Exercising his leadership, Bruce was aware of the other members' views and encouraged them to share their ideas, and intentionally provided opportuties for some members to present before the clas. Evelyn, as a sharp oserer and a reflective leaner, tok notice of the comprehensive classoom situatio, including th fierce competition between groups and the performance from other classmates, which facilitated both cognitive and social engagement in the group, contributing to the co-construction of meanings.

# 6. Implications and conclusion

The findings regarding peer effects on learner engagement have some implications for EAP instructors. It is helpful to attend to group dynamics, especially the member(s) playing th leading role in the group. Although the leader in the focus group in ths study seemed to help the group membersco-constructing meanings in the tasks, it i posible that the leader of a group may guide other members toward a different direction. Should the leader become overly dominant or irresponsible, per effects in the group context might negate engagement and jeopardize learning outcomes (Leeming, 2021).

As the findings of this study suggest, certain dimensions of learner engagement can co-exist with other dimensions. When students become metacognitively aware of the power of peer efects, teachers may consider fostering their interactions, in order to promote their task collaboration and maximize their learning outcomes. For instance, social engagement, highlighting prs mutual support with each other, plays a key role in shaping leaners emotional engagement; the emotions that arise in group work have a profound influence on behavioral and cognitive engagement (Sang & Hiver, 2021). Moreover, as shown in the study, the familiarity among group members may also afect emotional engagement, which can inform teachers of appropriately grouping students when conducting collaborative activities.

In concusion, whers existing studes (.g., Justice et al, 2011; Shmerse, 2021) hve investigatd the influence f pr effects on learning outcomes, this study focuses on the learing proces, demonstrating how peers afect each thers engagement and how such effect change over time. By constructing a framework of learner engagement in the collaborative academic reading context, the researchers identified how peers engaged in collaboratie tasks. Built upon ths, the study explored how pers impacted each other's engagement by unveiling students' behavioral engagement, cognitive engagement, social engagement, and emotional engagement, and investigated the trajectory of such impacts. The study thus provides help for both researchers and teachers. Although researchers are aware of the importance of per effcts in small groups, there are only a limited number of studies showing how clssroom behaviors, cognitions, social interactions, and emotions were influenced by peers. Also, the findings can provide insight for teachers on how to help students improve their engagement and cultivate their positive influence on each other to facilitate co-construction of meanings more efectively in the claroom. Given the elusive and complex nature of pr efects, it i crucial to help students develop their metacognitive knowledge and strategies for a consistency of positive peer effects on each other.

Despite the findings above, there are several limitations of this study that should be adressed. First, this study adopted the three. stage teaching method', which promoted group interaction through collaborative tasks. As a result, the findings of this research in terms of er effcts could not be entirely eparated from the nature of the collaboratie tasks. Second, the classoom activities were audiotaped but not videotaped. Although the researcher asked questions about peers non-verbal behaviors influencing engagement in the interviews, the findings may not fully reveal how the participants affect each other's engagement in class Future research may include the examination of the gestures and expressions of group members, and semiotic elements embedded within the group discussion. Also, the study is conducted in a collaborative learning context within an EAP course in a Chinese university. Future research can extend the research contexts to other subject contexts and sociocultural settings.
