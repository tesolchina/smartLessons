L2 Modern Greek

Complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) have been proposed as measures of L2 performance and are fundamental variables of written analysis. Empirical studies have shown how written production is developed across proficiency levels and have highlighted the impact of language learning context (second versus foreign) on such development. Despite research that analyzes L2 written production in relation to L2 proficiency or L2 context, few studies examine both in combination. This study explores the role of proficiency and learning context in the written production of L2 Modern Greek learners. Three hundred twenty-four $( \mathrm { N } = 3 2 4 )$ ) L2 Modern Greek learners of different proficiency levels (A2 to C1) studying in two different learning contexts (second: Greece versus foreign: Spain) carried out a written task (opinion essay). The results showed that two indices of the length of production (mean length of sentence and clause), one index of subordination (dependent clauses per clause), accuracy, and fluency were good indicators of proficiency level. Also, learning context affected the length of production, sentence complexity, and subordination. While differences were observed between the two settings, no superiority of one context over the other was found. Significant interaction effects between context and proficiency were detected in syntactic complexity (coordination) and fluency.

# 1. Introduction

Writing is one of the four basic skill in a language learning process From the perspective of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), it is a demanding skill since learners have to recall the suitable language information (morphosyntactic, lexical etc.), organize their ideas, and focs on different aspet of the targt-language, such as grammar, syntactic structure, spelling, and puncttion (ellgg, 1996). In the SLA field, it isclamed that wrtten production is directly related to L2 development and language learning (Manchon & Cerezo, 2018), and astrong correlation has bee found between writing performance and L2 proficiency (Lu, 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Ortega, 2003). In the paper, we are referring to written production as the result of learners writing, while writing performance more broadly includes the writing skills of L2 learners and how they execute them.

More specificall, written production can be assessed by thre different dimensions, complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF; see

Skehan, 1996, 1998). Complexit refers to learners' abilit to use a variety of grammatical structures and forms in the target language (Ortega, 2003; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998). Accuracy refersto leaners aility to produce a written text conforming to target language norms (House & Kuiken, 2009; Housen et al., 2012; Palltt, 009; Skehan, 996). Finally fluency is defined as learners ability to produce texts in large chunks or spans (Abdel Latif 2013). These aspects of writen analysis can serve not only as a general measure of writing performance, but also as a suitable indicator of L2 proficiency (Housen et al., 2012; Housen & Kuiken, 2009.

Writing seems to depend not only on L2 proficiency but also on other learning factors, such as the language learning context. The importance of learning context in SLA has been widely highlighted (Collntine, 2009; Collentine & Freed, 2004; Perez Vidal et al. 2018). Empirical studies have shown how studying an L2 in a second versus aforeign language seting (Ells, 1994) can impact L2 learners'linguistic gains due to the different quantity and quality of the input offered in these contexts.

The present study is part of a larger project entitled Learning, Teaching and Learning to Teach in Greek as an L2: Evidence from different learning contexts (henceforth LEEGR2). The study aims to explore the development of L2 writing in Modern Greek, in particular the efect of L2 proficiency and learning context on L2 written CAF. Despite numerous previous studies that explore these variables separately, there is limited reearch addresing them in combination (Strobl & Baten, 2022). This study, adopting a crossectional desig, ams to fll this gap in the literature by investgating if there is any difference in the written CAF at different pro ficiency levels and if the language learning context (second versus foreign) can lead to different patterns of L2 writig development. Furthermore, contrary to the majority of previous studies that include only beginner and intermediate level participants, the present study offers empirical dataon ll L proficiency lels (benner, intermediat, and adanced). Lastly, the study focuses on a language in which written production has not been previously explored in terms of the CAF dimensions. Modern Gree is a highly inflected language in terms f its verbal and nominal paradigm. The Greek verb is formed by a combination of a stem and an inflctional suffix that expresses a complex system of grammatical categories such as number (singular, plural), person (first, second, thrd), tense (past non-past), voice (active, non-active), aspect (perfective, imperfective), mood (imperative, non-imperative). In addition, a numer of particles (na, tha, as) can modify the inflected verb marking further mood distinctions (indicative-subjunctive) and tense oppositions (future-non-future). The Greek noun is also formed by a combination of a stem and an inflectional sufix that expreses gender (masculine, feminine, neuter), number (singular, plural) and case (nominative, genitive, accusative, vocative). Within a noun phrase, all declinable words (i.e. determners, adjectives, pronouns) must agree with the noun they modif in terms of gender, number and case (see Holton et al., 2012).

This makes the study of written production in L2 Greek challenging particularl in terms of exploring the accuracy dimension of CAF, which is measured by the number of errors, including morphosyntactic ones, found in the learners' texts. On the other hand, the analysis of syntactic complexity in Greek L2 written production may not be more challenging compared to other language, as there are no idiosyncrasies in terms of how sentences and clauses are measured. However, the rich morphosyntacticstructure of Modern Greek may present a challenge for the analysi at the level of phrasal complexity. Finally, writte fluency is a dimension primarily based on the extent of the text, thus not presenting any difficulties in its measurement.

Thus, the study of written CAF measures for the analysi of written production in L2 Greek can ofer new insights into the mul. tifaced procesof 2 writing. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical study that adopts CAF measures to analyze L2 written production in this target language.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Measuring L2 writing: complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF)

In SLA research, lexical and syntactic complexity are two distinct dimensions of linguistic complexity in second language per. formance and development. Lexical complexity focuses on the sophistication of the vocabulary used and can be asessed through text internal measures, including the type-token ratio and the index of Guiraud (Skehan, 2009). Additionall, external measures, which focus more on the propertie of leners than on those of texts, am to explore aspects of general language proficiency, such as scores on a receptive vocabulary test (Vermeer, 2000. Complexity also refers to the degre f tructral sophistcation, and different syntactic units such as sentences, T-units, and clauses are analyzed. In the current study, we focus on syntactic complexity.

In terms of syntactic complexity, a sentence can be defined as a unit that begins with a capital leter and/or has a period, question mark, r exclamation point at the end, and that contains at last one subject and predicate (Maloney & Hopkins, 1973, p. 426). Aclause is considered a construction that contains one verb phrase with any kind of noun phrase (Huddleston, 1984). Hunt (1966) sugested the minimal terminable unit of language (T-unit) as a unit of discourse analysis. A T-unit can be defined as "one main clause plus whatever subordinate clauses happen to be attached or embedded within it (Hunt, 1966, p. 765). A T-unit can be shorter than a sentence or can be identical to it. In other words, a sentence can contain one or more T-units.

Previous studies have applied several measures of syntactic complexit, which are based on the aforementioned syntactic units. For example, Wolf-Quintero et al. (1998) suggest one coordination index (Clauses per T-unit: C/T) and two subordination indices (Dependent Clauses per Clause: DC/C, and Dependent Clauses per T-unit: DC/T) as the most suitable measures of syntactic complexity. Moreover, Norris and Ortega (2009) propose the mean length of sentence, T-unit, and clause as important measures of overal complexity. In addition to these measures, they also add clausal subordination and coordination.

More recently, five diffrent groups of measures have been reported (Lu (2011): i) length of production (Mean Length of Sentence: MLS; Mean Length of T-unit: MLT; Mean Length of Clause: MLC), ii) sentence complexit (Clauses per Sentence: C/S) ii) subordnation (Clauses per T-unit: C/T; Complex T-units per T-unit: CT/T; Dependent Clauses per Clause: DC/C; Dependent Clauses per T-unit DC/T), iv) coordination (Coordinate Phrases per Clause: CP/C; Coordinate Phrases per T-unit: CP/T; T-units per sentence: T/S), v) particular structures (Complex nominals per clause: CN/C; Complex nominals per T-unit: CN/T; Verb phrases per T-unit: VP/T.

Regarding L2 proficiency, these measures differentiate each level in varying ways. For instance, clausal coordination is considered a more suitable indicator at beginner levels (Bardovi-Harlig 1992). In contrast, clausal subordination is a more useful index at in termediate levels, while phrasal complexity (that is, phrasal elaboration, such as coordinate phrases, complex nominals, and verb phrases) i at advanced levels (Biber et al., 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009). This increased phrasal complexity may reduce the mean length of clauses due to the fact that high-proficiency L2 learners tend to write with a moresynoptic style" (Norri & Ortega, 2009, p. 564). In any case, empirical evidence shows that as L2 proficiency develops, L2 learners write in more sophisticated ways (Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998).

Accuracy in the context of language learning refersto the ability of learners to produce written texts that conform to the norm, which is typicall considered to be the rule system of the target language (Housen et l., 2012; Palltti, 2009; Skehan, 1996). The analysis of written accuracy involves measuring the number ferrors in the written tex, such as those rlated to syntax, morphology, orthography, vocabulary, pragmatics, etc. An "error" is defined as any form that deviates from the rule system or norm (see Housen et al., 2012, p. 4). The need for generally accepted criteria for the definition of "error' for the assesment of accuracy has been repeatedy higlighted. Hwver, thus far it has bediffil for rerhers o rech an agrement on this act. Due to this, Housen et al. (2012) suggest that accuracy can be interpreted in terms of appropriateness and acceptability of the written text.

In order to aes accuracy, Wolf-Quintero et al. (1998) propose three measures: the number of error-free T-units (Larsen-Freman, 2006; Yuan & Ellis 2003), the number of error-fre clauses divided by the total umber of clauses, and the number of errors per T-unit However, Kuiken and Vedder (2012, p. 146) mention that one can use the measures based on error-free clauses in more advanced levels, as it is difficult to find any error-free units in the wrtten production of beginner and intermediat learners. Moreover, the number of errors per T-unit or the number of errors per 100 words may serve as better measures of the overall accurcy of language learners.

Finally, fluency refers to a learner's ability to produce texts rapidly and appropriately (Wolf-Quintero et al., 1998). It is optionally measured through the length of the learner's production (words) or the length of syntactical unit (sentence, T-units, clauses). Some researchers propose the mean length of syntactic units as a measure of writte fluency (Wolf-Quintero et al., 1998) and others propose it as a measure of syntactic complexity (Lu, 2011 Norri & Ortega,2009). Norrs and Ortega (2009) notice an overlap between the two measures and suggest that the mean length of syntactic units is a better measure of complexity than fluency. Abdel Laif (2013) explored how multiple measures of writing fluency were adapted from or influenced by measures of speaking fluency.

Moreover, fluency can be measured by computing the total number of words, T-units, or clauses per text (W/Tx, T/Tx, C/Tx), according to the previous studies (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021). It can also be measured in real-time when a text is produced within a Iimited time. In this case, many processes such as planning, monitorig, reviewing, retrieving, and transcribing are explored (Abdel Latif, 2013. The dhch thee res are amatd, mng the eqire teffort or tttio, is ao ae wal, 2014). Despite the divergent measurements of L2 proficiency, there is a consensus about the development of writte fluency, namely that more advanced learners are able to produce more fluent text than beginners (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Lu, 2011).

# 2.2. L2 Writing performance and L2 proficiency: empirical evidence

Several studies analyze L2 writing performance in relation to L2 proficiency. However, there are few studies that examine al three CAF dimensions in relation to L2 proficiency at the same time (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021). The majorit of studies explore the development of syntactic complexity and examine itas an indicator of L2 proficiency (Gyllstad et al., 2014; Khushik & Huhta, 2019; Kuiken & Vedder, 2019; Lu, 2011; Martinez, 2018;), some studies focus only on accuracy (Martinez, 2017; Thewissen, 2013), while others combine complexity and accuracy (Alexopoulou et al., 2017; Verspoor et al., 2012).

In terms of overall yntactic complexity, previous studies focus on the length of production, measuring the mean length of sentences, clauses, and T-units (MLS, LC, MLT). Most studies observed an increase in these indices across 2 proficiency. For instance, Barrot and Agdeppa (2021) found that thre measures f overall syntactic complexity (MLS, MLC, MLT) increased across lvels (A2, B1, B2) in L2 English, and, as a consequence, they can serve as proficiency level indicators. Similar findings were observed by Khushik and Huhta (2019), who analyzed argumentative essays of L2 English leaners with different levels (A1, A2, B1). Moreover, it has been argued that the mean length of sentences (MLS) increases linearly across L2 proficiency. Specifically, advanced L2 English learners tend to produce longer sentences compared to those at beginner and intermediate levels (Alexopoulou et l., 2017). As for the mean length of T-units (MLT) and clauses (MLC) it has bn found that these indices improve from beginer to intermediate level in both L2 English and L2 French (Gylstad e al., 2014; Verspoor et a., 2012), and from lower intermediat to intermediate in L2 English writing (Martinez, 2018). Therefore, empirical evidence has shown that length of production presents a growth across proficiency levels and thus it can serve as a good indicator of L2 proficiency.

Regarding subordination, most previous research claims that the subordination index is also a good indicator of L2 proficiency (Gyllstad et al, 2014; Lu, 2011; Martinez, 2018; Khushik & Huhta, 2019; Kuiken & Vedder, 2019). irst, subordination seems to differentiate eginner from intermediate level. More specificall, in L2 English written production, Barrot and Agdeppa (2021) found that all indices f subordination improved across proficiency level (from A2 to B2). fter observing diffrences between A2 and B1 levels, Kuiken and Vedder (2019) suggested that more proficient learners of L2 Italian use more subordinate clauses. Similarly, Khushik and Huhta (2019) found that two indices of subordination (DC/C, C/T) differentiated A1 from B1 level in L2 English. In the same line, Gyllstad et al. (2014) noticed that subordination could differentiate levels A1/A2 and B1/B2 in L2 French and L2 English

Concerning the two intermediate levels (B1, lower intermediate, and B2, upper intermediate),subordination has been found to be a determining factor. For instance, Barrot and Agdeppa (2021) found that ll indices of subordination diferentiated the two intermediate levels, except from the ratio of dependent clauses per T-unit (DC/T) in L2 English. However for more advanced levels, subor. dination has not been found to be such a determining factor. For instanceu (2011 claimed that students at high levels did not use subordination to increase the degre of the texts complexity in L2 English. In this sense, it i sugested that other measures, such as phrasal complexity (Lu, 2011) or mean length of clause (MLC) (Biber et al., 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009), may better discriminat the advanced levels. It should be noted, however, that the majority of previous studies focus only on the beginer and intermediate levels and do not present data from more avanced lel. t is thus difficut to make claims about the advanced levels and so further research is necessary in this direction (see Biber et al., 2011).

Contrary to subordination, coordination does not seem to be a suitable indicator of L2 proficiency, as it does not differentiate any proficiency level. Specificall, Barrot and Agdeppa (2021) analyzed the written production of L2 English learners (from A2 to B2) and observed that the three indices ofcoordination (coordinate phrases per clause: CP/C coordinate phrases per T-units: CP/T, and T-units per sentence: T/S) did not differentiate L2 proficiency levels. imilarly, Khushik and Huhta (2019) concluded that CP/C and CP/T, but not T/S, failed to differentiate the A1, A2, and B1 levels in L2 English.

Regarding accuracy, empirical studies have observed an increase across proficiency levels. More specifically, Barrot and Agdeppa (2021) found a decrese i learners wrien errors in L2 English as proficiency levels improved. They also found significant differences in terms of ccuracy among al proficiency levels (A2, B1, B2). imilarl, Aleopoulou et al. (2017) found that more proficient leaners produced more accurate texts than les proficient ones in L2 English. In terms of analysis of erors in L2 English writing, it was found that error developmental patterns tend tobe characterized by progress and stabilization trends (Martinez, 2017) and that progress is often located between B1 and B2 (Thewissen, 2013).

Similarly to accuracy, fluency also improves as L2 proficiency increases. Barrot and Agdeppa (2021) observed that one index of fluency (number of words per text: W/Tx) improved across proficiency levels, while other measures (number of T-units per text: T/Tx, number of clauses per text: C/Tx) decreased. Based on these results, they conclude that the ratio of words per text (W/Tx) is a good indicator of L2 proficiency in L2 English,as more proficient learners use fewer T-units and clauses than lessproficient ones. These results contrast with those of Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998) and Bulte and Housen (2014), which suggest that highly proficient leaners use more T-units. This discrepancy in results may be due to the instructions given in their written task or to the efects of task type.

To conclude, previous studies have shown that the mean length of sentence, clause, and T-unit, as well as accuracy and fluency, can be good indicators of L2 proficiency (Gyllstad et al., 2014; Khushik & Huhta, 2019; Kuiken & Vedder, 2019; Lu, 2011; Martinez, 2018) Additionall, while cordination does not seem to differentiate proficiency levels (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Khushik & Huhta, 2019), subordination does differentiate the beginner from the intermediate level, as well as the two intermediat lels (B1 and B2) or more advanced levels, phrasal complexity or mean length of clauses may be beter indicators (Norris & Ortega, 2009; Lu, 2011). Although measuring phrasal complexit can be challenging due to the morphosyntactic structure of Modern Greek, such an analysis was beyond the scope of our current research.

# 2.3. L2 writing performance and L2 context: empirical evidence

Previous research has established the importance of learning context in SLA (Collentine, 2009; Collentine & Freed, 2004) Empirical studies have shown that L2 linguistic development can be affected by differences in the quantity and quality of input that appear in a second versus a foreign language setting.

Although there are several studies that analyze written production in one of the two learning contexts (second or foreign), to our knowledge very few compare how the written CAF measures unfold in both contextscros-sectionally. Some of these comparative studies explore L2 syntactic complexit in a second versus a foreign language stting (Barrot & Gabinete, 2019; Ortega, 2003); others either inlude data from bth contxs ut fous only on the analyis ofthe difference btwe proficiecy leel (Tauchi t a., 2013) rather than the role of the setting itelf, or they exclusively examine the development of CAF dimensions during study abroad (Strobl & Baaten, 2022).

These empirical findings thus far suggest that 2 writing sms to be influenced by the learning context. More specifically, syntactic complexity has been observed to be higher in a second rather than in a foreign learning context. Barrot and Gabinete (2019), for instance, observed that learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) produced more complicated texts as compared to learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Similarly, Ortega (2003 found significant differences between the two contexts regarding the mean length of sentences and T-units (MLS andMLT) sugesting that these indices seem to be higher in the second as compared to the foreign language learning context. One possible reason for this differentiation is that leaners in a second language context might be exposed to more varied and authentic language input, leading to greater syntactic complexity in their output. Moreover, it has been claimed that learners in a second language learning context produce more accurate texts than those in a foreign language learning context (Barrot & Gabinete, 2019). Nevertheless the results are mixed in terms f fluency. Barrot and Gabinete (2019) found that ESL learners are more fluent in terms of mean length of text (average number of words per text: AW/Tx), while EFL leaners are more fluent in terms of clause and T-unit level (average number of clauses per text: AC/Tx, average number of T-units per text: AT/Tx).

To conclude, it seems that learners studying in a second language learning context tend to produce more complex and more ac. curate writen texts as compared to those studying in a foreign language learning context I is worth mentioning that in these studies the exposure to the target languages, such as immersion experiences, authentic materials, interactions with native speakers, and the type of instruction, such as communicative language teaching or task-based learning, were taken into account. Results regarding the effect of leaning context on fluency show that furthereearch is necesary. The current study aims to address this ssue by exploring how L2 writing, as operationalized in terms of CAF, develops in these two contexts during the acquisition of Modern Greek.

# 3. The study

# 3.1. Research questions

In light of the literature review presented above, the research questions that guide this study are the following:

1) To what extent do complext, ccuracy, and fluency of L2 learners of Modern Greek develop at diffrent proficiency levels?In Other words, does learners' written CAF improve as they move to higher proficiency level, and if o, can CAF measures be a valid indicator of L2 proficiency?   
2) Does language learning contex (second and foreign) impact the development of L2 learners written production, as assessed by measures of CAF? In other words, do CAF measures present differences in the second versus foreign language learning context?

# 3.2. Participants

A group of 324 learners of Modern Greek as an L2 (110 male, 214 female) participated in this study. 210 of them studied Modern Greek as second language at a universit language school in Athens, Grece, and they had different first language (L1) backgrounds.? The remaining 114 studied Modern Greek as foreign language at two language schools in Barcelona, Spain, and had Spanish and/or Catalan as their L1(s). The distinction adopted between second and foreign language context was based on geographical criteria, as suggested by Elli (1994). In other words, learning context was defined as the setting where participants were studying the target language (Greece versus Spain) at the time of data collection.

The two language schools in Barcelona constitute the two official institutions for the teaching of Modern Greek in this area (for more information, Author 2, in press). The thee language schools which participated in the study share the same general charateristics in terms of proficiency level classification, hours of instructio, curriculum and pedagogical approach. Participant, both in Greece and in Spain, were attending a 9-month course. Their age ranged from 17 to 77 $M = 3 6$ SD: 14.6) (Greece: Min.: 17 Max.: 74 M $= 3 1$ $\mid S D = 1 1 . 4 \AA$ (Spain: Min.: 20 Max.: 77 $M = 4 6$ $S D = 1 4 . 7 $ . They belonged to different proficiency levels, from A2 to C1, according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe, 2001).

The participants' distribution per level can be found in Table 1 below:

# 3.3. Task

Participants written production was elicited through an opinion essay. Participants were presented with a topic concerning studying L2 Modern Greek in different learning contexts. More specifically, the topic was: Modern Greek essons in Greece. Moden Greek lesons in your country. Epressyor opinio. This topic was chosen because it was open-ended and i would be rlatively easier to elicit leaners opinions even at the beinner levels. In addition, it enabled the collection of sociocultual information, which was used in other studiesof the broader research project The language used in the title was deliberately chosen to be simple for the beginners to better understand it. Participants were given $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ to complete the task, without additional time for planning, in order to make the task cognitively more complex. This decision was based on the fact that the task was already simplified and not very challenging. Allowing more time would have further reduced the cognitive demands of the task, particularl for advanced leaners. A questionnaire was also administered in order to elicit participants' personal information and linguistic background.6

# 4. Data collection and coding

Before the data collection, all participants were asked to sign a consent form for their participatio in the study. Datacollction was carried out at the beginning of the academic year, and specifically during the irst wee f the course in the participants' own clas. First, participants had to complete the written task and then the questionnaire. For the written task, participants were not allowed to use dictionaries or ther reources. Aftr data collection, llwitten productions wre transcribed using Mcrosoft Word. Then, in term of complexity and accuracy, the data were annotated manually by one researcher using the annotator UAM CorpusTool version 3.3 (O'Donnll, 2008). The annotation was performed by the same researcher in both contexts. Fluency (total number of words) was calculated automatically by the program QUITA (Kubat et al., 2014).

The selection of the indices was based on previous research (Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003; Wolf-Quintero et al., 1998), which categorizes them into five types: length of production, sentence complexity, subordination, coordination, and pecific structure. More speiall, overall syntactic complexity was measured by calculating the mean length of production (Lu, 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009). The mean length was calculated by the total number of words divided by the number of sentences, T-units, and clauses (MLS, MLT, MLC). Subordination was measured by calculating the proportion of dependent clauses to the total number of T-units and clauses (DC/T, DC/C), and the proportion of clauses to T-unit: C/T (Wolf-Quintero et al., 1998). Coordination was calculated by dividing the total number of T-units to sentences (T/S) and sentence complexity by dividing the number of clauses by sentences: C/S (Lu, 2011). These indices exhibit a partial collinearity as they appear to measure different but slightly overlapping aspects of syntactic complexity. However, this overlap is positively exploite in the present study. More specifically, the CAF framework provides a multidimensional perspective on L2 writing by encompassing complexit, accuracy and fluency. While some overlap may exist between measures within each dimension, each dimension taps into distinct constructs. The selection of multiple measures within each dimension aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of each construct.

Moreover, the observed collinearity is considered a threat only in linear regression modeling and not for the AnoOVA and t-tes used in this study (Voss, 2005). In A0VA and t-tes, collinearity does not directl affect the results as these tests evaluate the main effect of indeendent variables and/or differences between groups. These analye can sill be appropriately used to analye the main effects of proficiency level and learning context since the dependent variables (CAF measures) are considered each time individuall. However, according to previous research standards (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Lu, 2011), further research is needed to examine the correlation patterns between all these variables and their conditioning from other variables.

Accuracy was measured by the total number of errors per 100 words (all errors/total words $\times ~ 1 0 0 ^ { \cdot }$ , based on previous studies (Baoshu & Chuanbi, 2015; Vasylets & Marin, 2021). For the currnt analysis, we considered morphosyntactic lexical-pragmatic, and spelling errors. Accent errors were not included. Fluency was measured by the total number of words per text (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021). At this point, we would like to highlight that the coding process particularly with regards to accuracy and complexity, presented several challenges. The most important were related to subject-verb agreement, gender, cases, and verb omission.

Following the annotation and the coding, statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS 26). Descriptive statistics, an Analysis of Variance (AnovA), and an independent samples t-test were performed.

# 5. Intra-rater reliability

To assess the intra-rater reliability of quantitative measures, a few months after the first coding, $3 0 \%$ of the data were recoded again by the same reearcher, who was trained to the annotation system according to the fllowing schema: i) sentences defined as unts that begin with a capital ltter and/or have a period, question mark, or exclamation point at the end, contaning at least one subject and predicate; i) T-units comprising one main clause along with any attached or embedded subordinate clauses, both independent and dependent ii)clauses: recognized as constructions that include one verb phrase with any type of noun phrase; iv)accuracy errors related to syntax, morphology, orthography, vocabulary, and pragmatics.

Cohen's Kappa was 0.84 for sentences, 0.84 for T-units, 0.83 for independent clauses, and 0.81 for dependent clauses. Regarding accuracy, Cohen's Kappa was 0.81. Cohen suggested that the Kappa result be inerpreted as follows (Cohen, 1960; Cohen, 1988):values $\leq 0$ as indicating no agreement and 0.01-0.20 as none to slight, 0.21-0.40 as fair, $0 . 4 1 - 0 . 6 0$ as moderate, 0.61-0.80 as substantial, and 0.81-1.00 as amost pet ament. Bas n the aove rubric,all Kppa coficients otind in r stdy fall wthin the range of substantial to almost perfect reliability.

# 6. Results

The results of the analyses will be presented in two sections. The firstoffers the results on the role of proficiency in CAF measures.

The second section includes therults on the role of the language learning context, as well asthe interaction btweenthi vriable and L2 proficiency.

More specificall, in terms of the firt research question, to explore the independent variable of L2 proficiency in comparison with the dependent variable of CAF measures, we will present the descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) of the CAF measures across the four levels of linguistic proficiency (A2, B1, B2, 1). Since the proficiency levels have four distinct categories, we will perform a one-way ANOVA for each of the CAF measures. This statistical analysis aims to examine whether there are significant differences in the means of the CAF measures among the proficiency levels. Moreover, we will calculate the statistica ignificance of the model, including the effect size of the main effect (partial $\eta ^ { 2 } )$

Following the ANOVA, to explore the differences in the CAF measures between adjacent proficiency levels, we wil conduct post hoc tests. Specifically, we will employ the Tukey Honesty Significant Diference (HD) test, that helps identify which pairs of proficiency levels exhibit ignficant dfferences in the CAF measures. The Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test stands out in statistical analysis for its ability to efectively manage the risk of Type I errors, particularly in scenarios involving multiple group comparisons following an ANOVA test. This tes is adept at conducting pairwise comparisons acros groups, rrespective of whether these groups are of equal or varying ies It offers a balanced approach, being conservative enough to minimize false positives while still retaining the power to detect genuine dfferences. This additinal analys will contribut toacomprehensive exploration of how CAF measures vary across different L2 proficiency levels.

Regarding the second research question, to explore the impact of the independent variable of L2 context on the dependent variable of CAF measures, we wil present the descriptive statistics of CAF measures (means and standard deviations) between the two leaning contexts and conduct independent samples t-tests for each CAF measure. The use of this analysis is appropriate for comparing means between two distinct groups, in this case, the two learning contexts. Each independent samples t-test will be accompanied by a Levene's test to asss the equality of variances assumption. Moreover, we willestimate the effect size using Cohen's d.

# 6.1. L2 Proficiency

Table 2 below contains the descriptive statistic of the CAF measures across the four levels of inguistic proficiency examined inthis study (A2, B1, B2, C1).

The evolution of the means of the CAF measures shows that nearly allinguisic complexity indices increase linearly as the proficiency level increases. The exception to this anticipated trend is the coordination index (T/s), which does not show a linear progression and does not seem to differentiate the levels of L2 proficiency.

To further evaluate the trends detected in the decriptive statistic f our dataset, we proceeded with the statistical evaluation of the main effect f our study, .e. the roficiecy leel d th ng contt. ice the roficiecy lel ha our distict catrie 2, B1, B2, C1), we performed a one-way ANOVA for each of the CAF measures and calculated the statistical significance of the model. including the effect size of the main effect (partial $\eta ^ { 2 } )$ (Table 3). Moreover, since we performed 10 t-tests (one for each CAF measure), we used a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of 0.005 per test (0.05/10).

The results reveal that the proficiency level influences all CAF measures (except coordination) in astatistically significant way.

Table 4 shows the dfferences in the CAF measures between adjacent proficiency levels. It is observed that the sentence complexity and the coordination index do not seem to differentiate any adjacent level. In contrast, the mean length of production (MLS, MLT) differentiates B1 from B2 level, and the mean length of clause (MLC) B2 from C1, whereas one index of subordination, DC/C, distinguishes A2 from B1 level. Regarding accuracy, significant differences are obtained between A2-B1 and B2-C1 proficiency levels, whereas regarding fluency, significant differences are observed between A2-B1and B1-B2 proficiency levels.

# 6.2. Learning context

To evaluate the influence of the second main effct(i., the different learning contexts in which the linguistic production took place), we compared the means of the CAF indices in the essays produced in Spain and Grece. We used the independent sample t-test, and due to the multiple comparisons involved (10), we applied the Bonferroni correction considering statistical significance at 0.005 (0.05/10). The t-tests performed are summarized in Table 5 below. For each t-test, we first applied a Levenes tst toasses theequality of variances assumption. We marked with superscripts $a$ and $^ { b }$ the corresponding assumption (equal or unequal variances), and we reported statistically significant $p$ $( p < 0 . 0 0 5 )$ in bold fonts. Moreover, we estimated the effect size using Cohen's d.

Most of the CAF measures diffrentiate between the two learning contexts in a statisticall significant way. More specificall, the length of production, the sentence complexity, and the subordination are influenced by the country where language learning takes place.

Since both learning context and linguistic proficiency level influence the CAF measures and define the overall complexity of the learners inguistic production, we wanted to furthr examine the main effects and the interaction of these variables. More spefall, two-way ANOVAs were performed to analyze the impact of learning context and language proficiency level on each of the CAF measures calculated in our corpus. The results are summarized in Table 6:

Results reported in Table 6 confirm the main effct of both independent variables (learning context and proficiency level), as they were independently assesed with t-test. Moreover, statisticall signficant interaction effcts were detected in two different CAF measures: syntactic complexity (coordination) and fluency. To interpret the independent variables interaction paterns, we produced interaction plots with $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals. The coordination plot can be shown below in Fig. 1:

The interaction plot of coordination reveals a reversal of the mean at the A2 level between the two learning contexts. More spe. cifically, at the A2 level Modern Greek learners in Spain were using more coordination than Modern Greek learners in Grece. This tendency changed at the B levels (B1 and B2), with students in Grece using more coordination than students in Spain. Interestingly, the C1 level students from both learning contexts used coordination with the same average, although students in Spain exhibited a wider variance.

The second statisticall significant interaction detected was related to fluency. The fluency interaction plot can be sen in Fig. 2 below:

The interaction plot of fluency also reveals a shift in the general trend observed in the fluency graph. Overal, fluency is higher across the A and B levels for learners i pain than for learners in Grece. owever, at the C1 level, we can see a reversal of the trend, and the learners in Greece surpass their Spain counterparts.

# 7. Discussion

# 7.1. L2 Proficiency

Our first research question asked whether L2 proficiency plays a role in the development of CAF measures and if syntactic complexity, accuracy, and fluency can be good indicators of L2 proficiency. Results indicated that L2 proficiency was a determining factor for all the CAF measures (except cordination) since we found that L2 proficiency had an impact on two indices of the length of production (MLS, MLT), one index of subordination (DC/C), accuracy, and fluency.

With regard to syntactic complexity, our findings revealed that as L2 proficiency increased, learners tended to produce more complex written texts in terms of longer sentences (MLS) and T-units (MLT), afinding which is in line with those of previous studies (Alexopoulou et al., 2017; Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Gylstad et al., 2014; Khushik & Huhta, 2019; Lu, 2011; Verspor et al., 2012) However, while MLS (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Martinez, 2018;) and MLT (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021) distinguished between the intermediat levels (B1-B2), they did not diffrentiate between beginners and low-intermediate learners (A2-B1), which contrasts with the findings of previous studies (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Gyllstad et al., 2014 Verspoor et al., 2012). urthermore, to our knowlede, the differentiation between upper-intermediate and advanced levels (B2-C1) appears to be a novel finding, which should be further explored, in comparison to phrasal complexity. On the other hand, we observed an increase at the clausal level (MLC) from inter. mediate to advanced levels. This result implies that MLC seems to be a better indicator for more advanced levels, as is also argued by Norris and Ortega (2009).

Regarding subordination, decriptive statistics showed an evolution for the three indices (C/T, DC/c, DC/T), in line with previous studies (Khushik & Huhta, 2019; Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Martinez, 2018). However, the ratio of dependent clauses per clause (DC/C)

seems to be a bettr indicator f L2 proficiency, as it ifferentiates the beginner from the intermediate leaners (Khushik & Huhta) 2019; Lu, 2011. Thus, we could conclude that subordination indices that are ased on the clause are bettr indicators of L2 proficiency than those based on T-units (DC/T, c/T); however, se Gylltad et al. (2014) for different results regarding DC/T. Future research should analyze subordination in corrlation with other variables, such as phrasal complext, given that previous studies have argued that these measures are probably more suitable for the more advanced levels (Lu, 2011).

Contrary to subordination, no significant differences between proficiency levels were identified for the coordination index (T/S) indicating that this index does not differentiate L2 proficiency (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021).

Sentence complexity increased as L2 proficiency developed. In other words, more proficient students produced more clauses per sentence as their proficiency level increased. Therefore, we observed that sentence complexity discriminated proficiency levels, and t seems that it can be a suitable indicator of L2 proficiency (Martinez, 2018; Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021).

Regarding accuracy, we observed that as participants' L2 proficiency improved, the total number of errors decreased in their texts a patten that has also been documented in the majorit ofprevious studies (Alexopoulou et al, 017; Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Martinez, 2017 Thwissen, 2013). The large effct sif accuracy on 2 proficiency leds usto argue that accuracy s agood indicator of L2 proficiency and can differentiate levels. More specificall, we observed that accuracy couldistinguish beginner from low in. termediate (A2-B1) and upper intermediate from advanced learners (B2-C1), but not the two intermediate levels (B1-B2). This finding partill agree with Barrot and Agdeppa (2021), who found sigificant diffrences among all proficiency levels. The lack of differences between the two intermediate levels (B1-B2) could beattributed to the morphological complexity of the target language. t might be the case that L2 Modern Greek requires more time for the development of ccuracy once the threshold level (B1) has been reached. Further research is ncessary to gain more insights into the development of accuracy at intermediate proficiency levels. Moreover, it should be pointed out that in the current study, a possile trade-ff relationship between acuracy and fluency or syntactic complexty is not examined. Such a relationship could affect the accuracy of learners and also lead to a change in the type of erors. This adds another dimension to our understanding of the topic.

Fig. 2. Interaction Plot of Fluency (Error Bars: $9 5 \%$ CI).

As far as fluency is concerned, it was observed that as the proficiency level increased, learners presented longer texts, producing more words per text: W/Tx (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021). Moreover, because of the large ffect size of variables, we could claim that fluency is grally utable indcatr of  rofciency.More spficll, witten fluency wa found to sigficanly dfferntiatethe beginners (A2) from low intermediat students (B1) and the two intermediate lels (B1-B2), but not intermediate students (B2) from more advanced ones (C1). It might be the cas that C1 learners present more phraal complexty rather than longer texts (fluency). The type of task and its influence on the written output is another variable that must be explored in future research.

To summarize firstly we observed that al measures, apart from coordination, followed a development across L2 proficiency. Secondly, we argue that two indices of the length of production (MLS, MLT), one index of subordination (DC/C), accuracy (number of errors), and fluency (W/Tx) seem to be good indicators f proficiency level.Finally, we observed that CAF measures seem to differentiate the adjacent levels differently.

# 8. Learning Context

The second research question sought to explore whether there are any possible differences in terms of CAF measures in the two language leaning contexts scond versus foreign). Our reults suggest that language leaning context affcts the length of roduction, sentence complexity, and subordination. However, length of production has yielded some contradictory findings. MLS did not differentiat 2 context, whereas MLT and MLC did but in a different way. Learners in Spain (foreign context produced longer T-units and had better performance in MLT than those in Greece, but learners in Grece produced longer lauses than those in Spain and had better performance at the clausal level. This precedence of the MLC index in the second language setig is also confirmed i other studies (Barrot & Gabinete, 2019; Ortega, 2003). A possible explanation for the fact that students in Greece produce longer clauses compared to those in Spain may be based on exposure to language input provided by the second language context.

In terms of subordination, all indices seem to be L2 context-dependent. Indeed, the L2 learners in the foreign context produced more subordinate clauses than those in the second language learning context. This finding seems to be in contrast to that of Barrot and Gabinete (2019), who observed that the ratio of dependent clauses per clause (DC/C) is higher in the second language learning context. These contradictory results may be due to the fact that in that study, only the B2 level was included, whereas in our study we examined all proficiency lels. Morover, leaners in the foreign language learning context may perform bettr in subordination because ftheir L1 background. I fact, Barrot and Gabinete (2019) clamed that learners' L1 background influences the degree of subordination and the overall complexity. In our study, students in Spain, who share the sameL1s), might have been influenced by their 1(s) in their use of subordination. However, we could not make any claims about participants in Greece since they came from various L1 backgrounds Further research is necessary in order to shed more light on the possible role of the L1 in subordination.

Finally, learners had similar performances in both learning context regarding coordination, accuracy, and fluency, which indicates   
that these indices do not seem to be context-dependent. This finding suggests that the development of L2 written accuracy and fluency   
might not depend as much on the stting itelf as on other variables, such as the instruction that L2 learners receive in both contexts. Regarding the interaction between our two independent variables, L2 proficiency and L2 context, statisticallysignificant inter  
action effet were detected in two different CAF measures: coordination and fluency. Both intraction effcts may be atributed to the   
different quantity and quality of L2 input offered in these two contexts, a hypothesis which should be explored in future research.

Regarding coordination, the interaction between learning context and L2 proficiency was detected only across levels A2 and B1. Beginners in Spain presented higher coordination than those in Grece. This finding might imply that coordination a lesscomplex syntactic structure--is more frequent in the foreign language context, where the exposure to authentic L2 input is limited.

As for fluency, interaction effects were observed only across levels B2 and C1. Fluency was higher in the second language contex! (Greece), a result easily explained by the quantity and the quality of the input that characterizes this seting.

# 9. Conclusions

In our study, we explored and analyzed written production through the triad of CAF measures, focusing on the impact of L2 proficiency and L2 context on these measures. Regarding L2 proficiency, we observed that all CAF measures, except coordination, improve across L2 proficiency levels. Two indices of the length of production (MLS, MLT), the subordination index, accuracy, and fluency discriminate L2 proficiency and can be good indicators of it.

It was also observed that CAF measures discriminate the adjacent levels differently. Specifically, MLS and MLT turned out to be good indicators of the intermediate level. Regarding subordination, indices that have in the denominator the clause (DC/C) seem to be better indicators f L2 proficiency, mostly discriminating the beginner from the low intermediate level (A2-B1). In terms of accuracy, the written production of beginners was characterized by a high average f erors a different paen as compared to the performance of more advanced learners. At the same time, fluency seems to discriminate the beginner level from the low intermediate and the two intermediate levels (B1-B2). Finally, coordination did not seem to be a good indicator of L2 proficiency.

Exploring the impact of L2 context on the CAF measure, our results revealed that length of production, sentence complexity, and subordination were nfluenced by the context. Contrary to previous studies that identified a superiority of the second language leaning context, here t was only in MLC that we found better performance for this context. Furthermore, subordination, and not coordination, seemed to be more learning context-dependent. Last, students in both contexts seem to present similar performances in accuracy and fluency, suggesting that other variables, such as L2 instruction, may have a stronger impact on their development.

To conclude, the present study examined for the first time the CAF dimension in L2 Modern Greek considering two factors, language proficiency level and learning context. The study confirmed and further strengthened previous finding, such as the superiority of the second language context in terms of clausal level (MLC). On the other hand, this study could not establish the superiorit of MLT in the second language context and found that MLS did not differentiate the L2 context.

However, the study presents some limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the corpus used in our study includes only opinion essays, thereby not examining the task effect on the CAF dimensions. Secondly, while the development of CAF measures is examined in the two learning contexts, the study does not explore their ongitudinal development. Thirdly, due to the wide range of different learners L1 backgrounds in the second language context, it was not methodologically possible to explore the role of this factor in CAF dimensions. Fourthly, in this study the interaction of CAF measures i not presented to examine if there i any trade-off between dimensions. Furthermore, due to the rich morphosyntactic structure of Modern Greek, phrasal complexity was not examined in this paper. This analysis was beyond the scope of the current research.

Given these limitations, there is certainly room for future research. In the current study, we analyzed data elicited through an opinion esay. Future studies may explore other kinds of texts, such as argumentative or descriptive, or tasks with different levels of complexit, to explore the interaction of CAF measures and L2 proficiency. Moreover, future studies could explore other indices of CAF, such as phrasal complexity because previous studies have argued that certain measures are more suitable for more advanced levels (Lu, 2011). Additionall, in measuring accuracy, we calculated the total amount of errs, morphosyntactic, lexical-pragmatic and spelling ones, but future research could focus on investigating the proportion of error types and their relation to language proficiency levels. It would also be useful to further examine the posible trade-offs among indice of complexity, accuracy, and fluency as well as to investigate CAF measures in relation with individual differences, such as motivation, attitudes, aptitude, or working memory. The development of CAF dimensions in L2 Greek could also be examined in comparison to other languages, as wellas to the role of learners L1 background. Finall, ongitudinal studie ae necessary in order to delve further into the development of CAF in the long term.

Since this is the first time, to our knowledge, that CAF measures have been implemented into the study of L2 Modern Greek, our findings have important implications for the teaching and acquisition of Modern Greek as a Second/Foreign Language. Specificall, 2 teachers can use CAF measures to assessthe proficiency level of learners Furthermore, our findings underscore the necessity for an extended period of learning to foster accuracy due to the morphosyntactic complexity inherent in the Modern Greek language. We advocate for a systematic pedagogical approach focusing on teaching the rules of grammar and syntax. The absence of discernable differences i accuracy between the two learning contexts suggests that the development ofaccuracy can be significantly enhanced within the classroom environment. Regarding syntactic complexity, it is evident that subordinating conjunctions serve as a potent indicator of L2 proficiency. Thus, pedagogical strategies may incorporate explicit instruction on the usage of these subordinating structures. Conclusively, our research suggests that fluency rates are comparatively higher in a second language context, epecially among advanced learners. Thus, it i recommended that leaners of foreign language consider immersion within the target language country as a potential strategy to enhance their fluency.
