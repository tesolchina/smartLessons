Recommendations for Part A

Writing which i off-opic willnot sore well. This may happen when candidates memoris answers and use these in the exam, a practice which has ong been regarded as going against the aim of education. The emig f   take lci thrpi t   t ean ow to apdifft kins of wriing nd h prh w wh alit.so candidates need to have clear idea of what they are required to write and where the focus of the question lies so they should make sure they know the purpose of witing, what the target audience is and what genre is required before they start writing.

Relevant content, well-developed ideas and appropriat, accurate language are the keys to success in the Writing paper. The study of a language involves no short-cuts: grammar practice, mind-maps and selfcorrection are allhelpful, asi regular reading and witing practice.

Part B

Paper 2 Part B comprises cight questions (Q2-9), which arebased on the elective modules in the senior seondrys is p t w to choose one question and write about 400 words.

A total of 55,804 candidate attempted Paper 2 Part B. Their work was asessed according to thre domains: Content, Language and Organisation. The mean score achieved out of a total score of 42 for each question is provided in the table below.

# Question 6: Learning English through Debating

This question was quite well handled and had a relatively high mean score. Although not all candidates were aware of what a debate speech was like, most were able to give three reasons to support the motion. Some candidates did not read the question carefully and chose to argue against the motion even though the question asked candidates to include reasons to support the statement. There were some creative reasons given to support the statement and stronger candidates were able to discuss what being smarter as opposed to more knowledgeable means, before giving reasons.

General comments

The comments below relate t all responses (2-9) from this section of the examination. They fous on the issues that were most commonly cited by markers as being problematic.

Content

Candidates for the most part were able to give relevant content in most of the questions. They sometimes gave irrelevant details, however, which left them with insufficient space to develop other points. Sometimes, candidates were asked to adopt the stance given in the question or to argue against the stance. Failure to follow these instructions can lead to responses that lack depth and complexity.

Language

1nis year, tnere seems to have been a decrease in the use of 'memorised' words and phrases, which gave many candidates the opportunity to score better. It is hoped that this trend continues.

Language accuracy issues were common and in many cases affected overall meaning. These issues included spelling, parts of speech, gerunds/infinitives, word choice, subject-verb agreement, tenses and articles. Examples of language errors included:

lack of confident' (confidence)   
'they are self-discipline (self-disciplined)   
'Internet addition'(addiction)   
Graduates in the past take several jobs' (took/have taken)   
Watch TV is educational' (Watching)   
Heritage are important' (is)

At the lower levels,where meaning was affected and often obscured, there was a potential knock-on ffect on other domains where, for example, it might be unclear as to whether a point is being developed or not.

Choice of language

$\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { i v e \ w r i t i n g \ a n d } } \\ { \mathbf { p h r a s e s w i t h o u t } } \end{array}$ considering their appropriacy or the tone of the writing. ovamnles of this kind of language are:

While some sing praises to this choice in the bener ua... upuu 1 (sing praises' is $\mathrm { f o r m a l }$   
or legal language, which is not appropriate for the context).   
'anticipated' is usually preceded by an adverb).

# Organisation

lon sentence and developed.

eral, hee asa teny for candds tooverse re mrker   the exee of more sophisticated ties. An excerpt from last year's Examiner's report is worth repeating here:

As in previous years there was often too much emphasis placed on discourse markers as the only means of structuring and organising text. The two main problems with discourse markers was their relative overuse (many responses were peppered with furthermore, in addition, besides) and the fact that the discourse markers used were often simply inappropriate.

General recommendations

Accuracy of language is an important consideration in awarding marks. There is litle value in leaning ots of vocabulary and stock phrases if grammar errors are affecting meaning Some good vocabulay is unlikely to compensate for issues such as agreement, parts of speech and spelling in short, simple entne. ometimes es is more when it comes to writing it isoften better to writ horter anwers that meet the word count requirement) more accurately than to write more but with less accuracy.

A related point concerns the range of vocabulary required to score at higher levels. Wide vocabulary does not mean each sentence needs to contain low-frequency vocabulary; far from it. Across the whole answer there should be examples of a wide range of appropriate vocabulary. A top response therefore might be written in plain and accurate language for the most part with a few well-chosen examples of lowfrequency vocabulary where appropriate.

Part A (Compulsory section)

In Part A, candidates had to listen to four recordings cented on an intiative to select a twin cit for Hong Kong. As in the previous year's paper, the four tasks in Part A were designed to be progressively more difficult.

Task $1 ( \mathrm { M e a n } = 7 3 . 8 \% )$

Candidates were required to fill in a note sheet while listening to a radio chat show in which the host, Charlie Meadows, talks to Legislative Councillor Emily Lee and student Lemy Chan about the twin city initiative. Item I asked candidates to identify the subect that Lemy was studying at university. The correct answer was History and this proved to be the easiest item on Part A, wit $9 3 \%$ of candidates getting the correct answer. The speakers then moved on to discuss the background to the idea of twin cities and the candidates had to complete four bullet points (tems 2 to 5) with appropriat words and phrases.These were that twin cities are also called sister cities $8 7 \%$ correct)that twin cities must be in different countries $( 6 5 \% )$ that the modern idea of twin cities began after World War 2 $( 5 5 \% )$ and that the original goal of twin cities was to promote understanding between countries which had been fighting each other $( 5 8 \% )$ . The latter two items, Items 4 and 5, proved more challenging perhaps given the context of World War 2 and its aftermath, something that might have been unfamiliar to many candidates, requiring them to interpret what they were hearing.

In the next set of items, the speakers talked about how city twinning is normally done. Candidates were quite easily able to identify (from a list of countries) the two countries between which twinning had been most common (Germany and France) (Item 6; 81% correct), though the reason for this was more challenging (the countries had been next to each other or it had been easy for them to communicate) (Item 7 - 67%), requiring more interpretation of information. Item 8 was a multiple-choice item asking for the number of cities a big city is usually twinned with, and most candidates (74%) were able to extract the required information (Around 5) from other, conflicting information.
