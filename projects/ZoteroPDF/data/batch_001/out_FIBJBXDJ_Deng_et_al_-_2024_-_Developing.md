Case study

Genre awareness, the conscious knowledge of how genre features function in reading and writing (Tardy et al., 2020), plays a facilitating role in reading academic texts. However, there is limited empirical research focusing on novice academic learners’ genre awareness acquisition and development in collaborative reading contexts, despite the great benefits associated with such collaborative designs (Johns, 2008; Ye, 2020). Therefore, the current study, employing a qualitative case study approach, investigated how Chinese first-year university students acquired and developed genre awareness in collaborative academic reading. Data from multiple sources were collected, including classroom recordings, students’ written products, and semi-structured interviews, from two focal groups in a university English for Academic Purposes (EAP) reading course with a pedagogical design aimed at collaborative reading of research reports. Drawing on relevant genre and metacognition theories, data analyses revealed that these two groups of Chinese freshmen developed awareness of text structure, academic language, and academic norms, and that the development of the three types of metacognitive genre awareness followed different trajectories over a semester of collaborative academic reading. These findings contribute to our understanding of how novice academic learners become aware of an academic genre and learn it through a collaborative approach.

# 1. Introduction

Genre awareness, a general understanding of what genres are and how genres work (Tardy et al., 2020), often constitutes one of the principal goals of literacy curricula (Johns, 2008). It is equally important for both native/ESL (English as a second language) and EFL (English as a foreign language) learners. A large body of literature has reported that genre awareness plays a facilitative role in language learning, especially in that of writing (Cheng, 2008; Wingate, 2012; Yasuda, 2011; Yayli, 2011; Zare and Shahrestanaki, 2017). Researchers (e.g., Cheng, 2008; Yayli, 2011) have therefore called for explicit teaching of genrerelated concepts and features (e.g., rhetorical moves, audience, interpersonal meaning) in academic writing instruction. Likewise, much literature has also suggested that genre awareness could facilitate reading comprehension by directing reading practice (van Lacum, et al., 2012), stimulating learner autonomy (Haria and Midgette, 2014), providing schematic structures (Devitt, 2004), and constructing mental models (Johnson-Laird, 1980).

Specifically, for academic reading comprehension, most of the studies investigating the role of genre awareness have focused on experienced professionals and academics rather than novice academic learners who indeed face more difficulty. For example, first-year undergraduate EFL students, as a typical group of novice academic learners (Hermida, 2009; Trudell, 2019) new to the conventions of the academic discourse community, need to transit quickly from learning high school general English to learning college English for academic purposes (EAP) (Johns, 2008; Ye, 2020). During their transition to EAP learning, they may encounter numerous challenges in understanding academic texts, including lack of knowledge about the rhetorical structures of academic texts, unfamiliarity with disciplinary language features, and insufficient knowledge of connections between ideas within the text and beyond (Ohata and Fukao, 2014). These challenges are largely attributed to novice academic learners’ low awareness about the typical features of academic genres (e.g., research articles, laboratory reports, and systematic reviews) (Carter, 2007). In addition, these learners’ common practice of dealing with academic reading individually hinders their mastery of academic genres due to their very limited previous experience and knowledge of genres (Ohata and Fukao, 2014). Much research has demonstrated the effectiveness of peer interaction in language learning (e.g., Anderson and Nashon, 2007; Aukerman, et al., 2017; Howe and Zachariou, 2019; Sengupta, 1999), and positive effects of collaborative academic reading on the emergence of genre awareness have also been documented (Kelly-Laubscher et al., 2017; Yeh, 2015). Therefore, an investigation that explores how novice academic learners acquire and develop genre awareness in a collaborative manner is warranted. In this study, we aim to look into the development of genre awareness of two groups of Chinese EFL novices through collaborative academic reading, which would help us to better design EAP reading courses for novice academic learners.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Genre awareness in EAP literacy education

Genre, one of the most significant concepts in literacy education (Hyland, 2007), has long been studied multidimensionally in the area of applied linguistics (Hyon, 1996). In particular, it contains recurrent formal patterns that can be recognized by a particular group of people who use it (Hymes, 1974) and thus can be deployed to teach reading and writing. Genre-based pedagogy is now an integral component of EAP training (Cheng, 2008; Hymes, 1974; Hyon, 1996; Negretti and McGrath, 2018). In the past few decades, scholars have endeavored to develop and research genre-based pedagogy for the EAP writing classroom (e.g., Hyon, 2018), exploring its instructional strategies (e.g., Johns, 2015), learning outcomes (e.g., Cheng, 2008; Yasuda, 2011), and the influence of metacognition (e.g., Negretti and McGrath, 2018).

As for academic reading, the significance of genre and genre-based teaching is specially emphasized for novice academic learners (Johns, 2008) at the level of tertiary education. University students need to read various types of academic texts to acquire disciplinary knowledge (Grabe and Stoller, 2019), and hence academic genres such as narration, description, exposition, argumentation, research reports, etc. (Deng et al., 2014) play a critical role in their subject study as well as the development of their academic literacy (Grabe and Stoller, 2019). Indeed, academic reading is a critical yet complicated and demanding task for novice academic learners, especially those who are also L2 or EFL learners (Grabe, 2009; Nunan, 2003). Novice EFL academic learners are particularly pertinent to genre-focused teaching because they often have difficulty shifting from general EFL learning in high school to EAP training at university, as most of them have little prior experience with English academic discourse (Ohata and Fukao, 2014).

Given the impossibility of teaching every genre that novice academic learners encounter in their educational contexts, researchers have advocated the cultivation of genre awareness, that is, a broad understanding of what genres are and how genres work (Tardy et al., 2020), in order to deal with the ever-changing rhetorical situations in which a type of genre may function (Hedgcock and Lee, 2017; Hyland, 2007; Johns, 2008). Genre awareness can facilitate the acquisition of genrespecific knowledge by helping learners to adjust their rhetorical flexibility to various contexts (Johns, 2008) and by enabling them to use strategies to understand a genre well (Tardy et al., 2020). A large body of literature has shown that genre awareness can also direct students’ classroom practice (van Lacum, et al., 2012), stimulate learner autonomy (Haria and Midgette, 2014), provide schematic structures (Devitt, 2004), and construct mental models (Johnson-Laird, 1980) to facilitate reading comprehension and writing processes. Despite this well-recognized theoretical potential, in reality language teachers continue to experience great difficulty both in identifying what genre awareness specifically entails, especially in academic reading practices, and in applying appropriate strategies to its instruction and assessment in the classroom (Tardy et al., 2022).

To analyze the fostering and development of genre awareness, researchers often employ metacognition theory, since awareness and consciousness are primarily metacognitive (Negretti, 2012; Negretti and Kuteeva, 2011; Yeh, 2015), and metacognition theory can provide a specific and applicable model for analyzing the mechanism via which learners develop and employ genre awareness to comprehend academic texts (Negretti and Kuteeva, 2011; Wang, 2019; Wang and Yang, 2017). According to Schraw (2009, p.98), metacognition falls into two categories: “knowledge of metacognition” and “regulation of metacognition”. Schraw and Dennison (1994) refer to the former as knowledge about one’s cognitive processes in knowledge acquisition, including knowledge of: (1) context-specific concepts and strategies (declarative knowledge), (2) using these concepts and strategies to complete a task (procedural knowledge), and (3) how to use these concepts and strategies to acquire information (conditional knowledge). Regulation of metacognition is concerned with the learner’s control processes in learning, including planning, monitoring, and evaluating. Aligning genre theories and the metacognition framework, the concept of metacognitive genre awareness, as suggested by Negretti and Kuteeva (2011, p.98), pertains to the metacognitive processes exhibited by learners in relation to their conscious understanding of the genre, discourse, and rhetorical elements presented in academic writings. Similarly, genre awareness is defined by Tardy et al. (2020) as a type of metacognitive knowledge about forms and functions, discourse, audience awareness, sensitivity to genre variations, etc.

As researchers have explored the cultivation and development of genre awareness, they have also identified various factors that influence this developmental process. For instance, by analyzing students’ perceptions of genre-based classroom activities and tasks, Schraw and Dennison (1994) tracked the development of their genre awareness through research writing practices, with the metacognitive awareness (knowledge) framework. The findings suggest that the development of metacognitive genre awareness in second language learners depends on their ability to understand a particular genre and to use this understanding successfully in their writing. When engaging in reading and writing activities, some students concentrate primarily on the genre-specific elements, which can be categorized as declarative knowledge. Meanwhile, some students employ genre-specific elements to comprehend academic texts, demonstrating procedural knowledge. In addition, there are students who go beyond this and critically analyze the author’s techniques and intentions in utilizing particular rhetorical features, demonstrating conditional knowledge. In another related study, Kuteeva (2013) found that graduate students usually dealt with genre analysis tasks in two ways: descriptive and analytical. Students who favored the former approach paid more attention to the organizational aspects of a genre than to the interplay between genre features and its expected aims, audiences or subjects. In contrast, students with a more analytical mindset embraced the “author-reader” approach, where they considered the authors’ intentions and intended readers, adjusted their writing norms to suit their respective subject areas and rhetorical contexts, and demonstrated a higher level of genre comprehension. According to Kuteeva (2013), the observed difference can be attributed to factors such as students’ course objectives, familiarity with disciplinary conventions, and their comprehension of academic genres. It is thus clear that a good understanding (i.e. knowledge) and practice of academic genres can improve learners’ genre awareness, which conforms to the need for explicit teaching of genre knowledge in EAP literacy education.

# 2.2. Genre awareness in collaborative academic reading

Due to the importance of genre knowledge in enhancing genre awareness and literacy performance, many teacherscholars have advocated naturalistic instructional approaches from the learner’s perspective, characterized by collaborative and discovery learning (Whitney et al., 2011), in addition to the explicit instruction of genre features (Yapp et al., 2021). For example, Hedgcock and Lee (2017) investigated a cohort of pre-service teachers’ views and attitudes towards genre awareness raising activities and discovered that they preferred inferential methods and knowledge for genre creation to direct intervention. Furthermore, Tardy (2009) observes that the acquisition of genre attributes and the cultivation of genre awareness result from learners’ revising and enhancing their prior knowledge of a genre through continual exposure. As learners engage individually in genre-based activities, they may have a limited understanding of genre features due to personal biases from previous learning experiences (Whitney et al., 2011). One solution to this problem is to involve students in collaborative interactions (Howe and Zachariou, 2019). As sociocultural theories suggest, when learners engage in collaborative learning tasks, they are more likely to solve language and content related problems, and internalize scaffolded knowledge from their peers (Storch, 2017).

Collaborative academic reading has been found to be beneficial for the development of genre awareness in novice academic learners, as it involves them in negotiating meaning in a rich genre-related context and constructing their understanding more effectively together (Jin et al., 2020). During the process of collaborative reading, learners play the role of “analysts” by engaging in discussions to clarify the organization and their understanding of a given passage within a specific context (Sengupta, 1999), with the increased metacognition leading to more frequent problem-solving and inquiry behaviors (Negretti and Kuteeva, 2011). Anderson and Nashon (2007) point out that although each learner’s metacognition is idiosyncratic, the metacognition of all group members influences group dynamics, which in turn influences each learner’s knowledge construction. There is evidence showing that collaboration enhances comprehension in collaborative academic reading where students engage in dialogue and build on each other’s ideas to construct meaning (Aukerman, et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2020; Martin-Beltrán, et al., 2017). Studies of genre-based instruction have yielded evidence of desirable outcomes of collaborative learning, including high levels of genre-related exposure, self-conscious metatalk, and genre-specific language production about academic genres, through which academic novices can develop emergent, inductive genre awareness rather than the understanding that a teacher didactically pours into them (Kelly-Laubscher et al., 2017; Whitney et al., 2011; Wingate, 2018; Yeh, 2015). However, little is yet known about the specific aspects of a genre that novice academic learners at the tertiary level are proactively aware of in collaborative academic reading, let alone their developmental patterns, both of which are crucial to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of novice learners’ academic literacy (Johns, 2008).

As reviewed above, previous research has reported on the significance of genre awareness in teaching and improving academic literacy, especially for novice academic learners, and has made efforts to study it as a complicated metacognitive process in which different factors may interact to influence learning outcomes. In a similar vein, recent EAP reading instruction has highlighted the role of collaborative interaction in fostering academic genre awareness. However, there are few empirical studies focusing specifically on how novice academic learners become aware of an academic genre and learn it through collaborative academic reading. To address this research gap, the current study endeavours to explore what novice academic learners become aware of about a genre and how their genre awareness develops in a collaborative learning context over the course of a semester. Two research questions were formulated to achieve the above research aim:

Research Question 1: What types of genre awareness do novice academic learners acquire in collaborative academic reading?

Research Question 2: How does this genre awareness develop over the course of a semester?

Addressing the two research questions requires a detailed description of novice learners’ emergent genre awareness in the context of collaborative academic reading. Therefore, a qualitative case study design (Yin, 2017) was employed.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Context and participants

This study was set in an EAP course at a comprehensive university in South China. The course aimed to develop academic genre awareness among first-year non-English majors by guiding them to read research reports collaboratively. The class met weekly for the duration of the 18-week semester, with each session lasting $9 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ .

The course utilized research reports from Science as the main reading materials for the following two reasons. On the one hand, research reports from Science are presented with a text structure similar to the common rhetorical sections of research articles, i.e., introduction-methods-results-discussion (IMRD) (Cortes, 2013), but within a maximum of 2,500 words. On the other hand, the use of reports from Science could guarantee the idiomaticity of academic language use as it enjoys a global prestige and publishes academic outputs that “merit global recognition by the wider scientific community and general public” (Science, 2020). Therefore, as miniatures with all the major genre-intensive elements adhering to the cultural convention of academic discourse, research reports from Science suit the purpose of fostering genre awareness in collaborative academic reading, and can serve as a stepping stone for novices’ induction into reading academic genres which has been implemented in previous pedagogical practices (Jin et al., 2020).

Over the 18 weeks of an academic semester, students were first required to read five research reports (Report 1–5) of approximately 2000 words each, covering topics such as education, morality, and ecology. These reports were divided by the course instructor into three rhetorical sections: Introduction, Data, and Answer, which were composed globally in sequence to facilitate the collaborative reading. All these five reports were distributed to students in printed form in class. No additional information was provided to the students except for a list of new words with their definitions and/or explanations in the margins of these materials. Therefore, students’ understanding depended entirely on what they gleaned from the text through their collaborative and individual reading. Then, to enrich the learning materials and to see whether novices’ emerging genre awareness could be “contextualized” (Tardy et al., 2020) when reading similar academic genres, the students were asked to read another research report (Report 6) of about 4000 words (twice the length of Reports 1–5) selected from another publisher and had already been divided by the publisher into sections and subsections.

Twenty-nine first-year students majoring in electronics and information technology were enrolled in the course, and their English proficiency was either upper-intermediate or advanced according to their performance in the National College Entrance Examination. These students were typical novice academic learners, as they had all studied general English in primary and secondary schools and had little formal EAP learning experience prior to entering the university. They formed six groups of four or five students at the beginning of the course, and each group worked together to complete the designed genre awareness raising activities. Following the “three-stage teaching method” (Jin et al., 2020; 2022), these activities were specifically designed to nurture the emerging genre awareness of first-year university students. For Reports 1–5, the five activities included cover reading, report reading, group discussing, outline presenting, and summary writing (see Table 1). For Report 6, the summary writing was replaced by poster making to diversify the teaching format, and more importantly, to prompt students to evoke and practice the genre awareness they had developed.

Following the principle of “maximum variation sampling” (Patton, 2014, p. 428), two groups of five students (Group 1 and Group 5) were selected as the focal groups: one was active and cooperative while the other was less active and cooperative, according to the initial 7-week classroom observation. Despite these differences, both groups were able to complete the tasks, providing us with rich data to examine their acquisition and development of genre awareness. Prior to data collection informed consent was obtained from both groups, and each participant was given a pseudonym to ensure anonymity. The profile of the participants is presented in Table 2.

# 3.2. Data collection

In order to provide a “thick description” (Yin, 2017), this study adopted a qualitative case study approach to investigate what novice academic learners, namely two groups of five first-year Chinese EFL university students, became aware of the research report genre and how this genre awareness developed in a collaborative learning context. The collaborative reading tasks were given in Week 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 of the semester. Data collection began in Week 8, following seven weeks of observing the classroom for group dynamics and collaborative effects.

a The effectiveness of the guideline, which was used throughout the group discussion, was observed in its ability to function as a cognitive stimulus, thereby improving students’ understanding and recognition of text structure. It consisted of eight scaffolding questions informed by a move analysis of 500 research reports from different disciplines.

As shown in Figure 1, there are five sources of data generated by the genre-awareness raising activities presented in Table 1. Together with the individual interview transcripts about their experiences of genre learning at the end of the course, the six data sources formed the data for this study. Multiple data sources served the purpose of triangulation in addressing the two research questions, helping to increase the credibility of the findings (Yin, 2017).

# 3.3. Data analysis

To address the two research questions, group discussion transcripts were analyzed as the primary data source, featuring evident displays of genre awareness in an authentic classroom environment. The transcripts were first divided into talk turns and then categorized into distinct episodes, from which those related to genre, i.e. genre-awareness-related episodes, were extracted to serve as the unit of analysis for the current study. Each genre-awareness-related episode focuses on a specific genre component with a central theme.

The genre-awareness-related episodes were coded twice in order to answer the two questions. The first-round coding of these episodes, which addressed Research Question 1, was conducted first inductively and then deductively (Yin, 2017) with reference to relevant genre theories identified in previous literature (e.g., Cotos et al., 2017; Galloway et al., 2020; Osborne, 2010; Qin et al., 2020) to generate codes for types of genre awareness that novices gradually acquired during their collaborative academic reading. By combining, reducing and/or adjusting these interim codes, a final coding scheme for recognizing types of genre awareness was eventually generated (Table 3). The second-round coding of genre-awareness-related episodes, which addressed Research Question 2, used an adapted version of the metacognitive awareness framework proposed by Schraw and Dennison (1994) (see Table 4 for the coding scheme) to capture the metacognitive depth of novices’ emerging genre awareness.

The other data sources were analyzed to support and triangulate the codes generated in the coding of the group discussion transcripts, thereby enhancing both the validity and reliability of our research. Specifically, oral presentation transcripts, outlines of research reports, and posters, which were produced in class, provided highly contextualized evidence of novices’ emerging genre awareness. Summaries and individual interview transcripts, which were conducted after class and revealed participants’ cognitive activities concerning research report genre, helped us to understand how and why novice readers engaged in certain behaviors that reflected their emerging genre awareness in collaborative academic reading and elicited their in-depth comments on genre-related features of research reports.

# 4. Results

4.1. Types of novice academic learners’ genre awareness

Research Question 1 aims to identify the types of genre awareness about the research report that novice academic learners became aware of in the context of collaborative academic reading.

# 4.1.1. Text structure: Shaping coherent text comprehension

Through continuous exposure to the research report genre, participants developed an awareness of the rhetorical sections and rhetorical moves. A semester-long group discussion in which participants collaboratively summarized the content of research reports fostered their knowledge of these “skeletons”, and they were able to use this metacognitive knowledge to assist upcoming collaborative reading practices. Extract 1 and Extract 2 show participants’ contextual induction of rhetorical sections and rhetorical moves, respectively.

# Extract 1 (Group discussion transcripts, Group 1, Week 8_Report 1) [rhetorical sections]

Tina: What is this “Discussion”?   
Jack: It’s just something that is put at the end of the text to.emm, explain. Tina: How do we say it in Chinese?   
Jack: “Taolun”?

In Extract 1, Group 1 was discussing their ideas about the rhetorical sections of Discussion in Report 1. Jack translated the names of the three rhetorical sections into Chinese to solve Tina’s puzzle about “Discussion” d she thought it was “a bit strange to name a section of an article like that”. It seemed to her that “Conclusion” was a more appropriate name for this very last section (Tina_Interview). Tina also admitted in the interview that before this course, she had no idea that a research report was conventionally and typically structured in this trisectional way.

Extract 2 (Group discussion transcripts, Group 1, Week 16_Report 5)   
[rhetorical moves]   
Jack: .you see, here, (in the text) about this concern, “.” and “.”.   
Michael: Basically, Introduction talks about what HOV is, what it is used for, and the controversy about whether it could make traffic congestion better.

In Extract 2, Group 1 was discussing the Introduction section of Report 5. Jack located the most direct sentences related to the content in the text, and Michael made a concise summary about what is known about this study and what is not known about this study, indicating their awareness of such a conventionalized way of packaging information in the research report genre.

4.1.2. Academic language: Increasing sensitivity to academic English

Similarly, the participants’ deep engagement with academic texts through the collaborative reading task fostered their awareness of academic language. Their collective handling of the intellectual rigor of academic texts gradually helped them become aware of the differences between academic and general English d academic English has its unique linguistic features, necessitated by the demands of the genre (e.g., see Extract 3 for Michael and Tina’s discussion of signal markers which unfolded the limitation of a research, and Extract 4 for Michael and Jack’s discussion of decoding proper noun “intent-to-treat” in context). Prevalent in academic settings, these linguistic features emphasize accuracy, rigor, cohesion and coherence (e.g., Michael’s reflection on general features in Extract 5).

# Extract 3 (Group discussion transcripts, Group 1, Week 12_Report 3) [signal markers]

Tina: The last limitation is about the cultural effect. Here, you see, in the last paragraph, there is a comparison. You see, “in some communities” bla bla . but “b contrast” bla bla. The last sentence is about the conclusion. See what follows this “nonetheless”.

Tina: Right. See the coming up “by contrast”. We can summarize these points a little bit in our outline.   
Michael: Right. This is actually a limitation.

In Extract 3, Group 1 was discussing a limitation of the research in the Discussion section of Report 3. Tina led her group members directly to the essential “cues” that she thought could summarize the discussion section, as this was more “direct and effective, very useful for the group summarizing task” and “helps her to focus her attention on the right units to complete the summarization” (Tina_Interview).

Extract 4 (Group discussion transcripts, Group 1, Week 10_Report 2) [decoding] Michael: .Then they performed an “intent-to-treat” analysis. What is this? Michael: Leave it. Anyway, it’s just about “the effect”.

Jack: I see, “intend-to-treat” means that there is a presumption that differences will occur between the two groups.   
Michael: Yes. The (upcoming) result also shows that .

In Extract 4, Group 1 was discussing a particular data analysis technique, “intent-to-treat analysis” in the text of Report 2, a figurative use common in medical studies. Here, although daunting for novices, Jack and Michael successfully inferred the meaning of this terminology by working together, linking the clues he gleaned from the text and his group members.

Extract 5 (Individual interview transcripts, Group 1)   
[general features]   
Michael: “Back in high school, we also read some (short) academic texts, but it is this full-length text that gives me the feeling that academic texts value the internal relationship so much . I think it is hard to keep considering the link between pieces of information from beginning to end as an academic writer.”

In Extract 5, by evaluating his own performance in oral presentation and summary writing, Michael was able to become aware of the problem that he had not sorted out the links between pieces of information that the authors had probably indicated in the text. This is a significant awareness of academic language, i.e., cohesion and coherence. Other frequently mentioned features of genre awareness are technical vocabulary, nominalization, sentences explaining graphic devices and the use of the first person.

# 4.1.3. Academic norms: Building a genre repertoire

Academic norms, such as figures and tables, academic reasoning, and formatting convention, constitute a significant promoter of academic literacy. Though cognitively demanding, the nurturing of such awareness was achieved through participants’ collaborative deliberation on the frequent use of visual representations (e.g., Adam and Owen’s use of figures to comprehend research results in Extract 6) and on restoring the authors’ logic chain (e.g., Owen’s use of “analytical framework” to understand the research process in Extract 7 and Adam’s notice of referencing style in Extract 8).

# Extract 6 (Group discussion transcripts, Group 5, Week 12_Report 3) [figures and tables]

Adam: I don’t quite understand the figures in the Data section.What is this “Effort, Non-effort, and Baseline”?

Owen: The middle line (here in the second figure) is (all the data’s) the median line, the upper (dots) are the most times that infants pressed. This figure could represent the distribution of the data as well as its upper and lower limits.

In Extract 6, Group 5 was discussing two figures in Report 3. Adam was supposed to read the Data section and clarify the meaning of these two figures, which outlined the procedures and results of the experiment. However, he was unable to manage the reading of these two figures. It was through Owen’s previous experience of reading these types of figures in the SAT (Adam_Interview) and Adam’s explanation of the relevant text in the Discussion section that Group 5 solved the puzzle. Brian commented in the interview that he really enjoyed such “quick wits” in group work.

Extract 7 (Group discussion transcripts, Group 5, Week 18_Report 6)   
[academic reasoning]   
Owen: I see. Actually, this report has an analytical framework. It actually applied a model proposed by someone in 2018, which is, emmmm, GOE (“Grasp of Evidence”).You see, the first dimension.

In Extract 7, Group 5 were at the end of their discussion of Report 6, and it was only after Ben’s summary of the Discussion section that Owen came to realize that the reason why “different sections looked familiar” (Owen_Interview) was because Report 6 followed a strict “analytical framework”.

Extract 8 (Summaries, Group 5, Week 16_Report 5)   
[formatting convention]   
Adam: .but research (Rema Hanna, Gabriel Kreindler, Benjamin A. Olken Science 07 Jul 2017: Vol. 357, Issue 6346) has proved that such act has limited effect.

In Extract 8, Adam summarized the main idea of Report 5 with an explicit citation of Report 5, although the format was not normative enough. He explained in the interview that he remembered the teacher’s brief feedback about the formatting issues in their summary writing, particularly the citation.

# 4.2. Development of novice academic learners’ genre awareness

Research Question 2 concerns the development of novice academic learners’ genre awareness in collaborative academic reading, i.e., changes in the three types of genre awareness discussed above. Our analyses showed that the three types of genre awareness developed at various paces and following different patterns.

# 4.2.1. Text structure: Toward conditional awareness

Over time, a more refined perception of the rhetorical sections and rhetorical moves emerged in the participants’ utterances. Table 5 summarizes the development of text structure awareness for Group 1 and Group 5, with the numbers in brackets indicating the frequency with which the students displayed the corresponding types of genre awareness (the same as in Table 5 and Table 6).

Table 5 Development of text structure awareness.   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Declarative awareness</td><td colspan="2"> Procedural awareness</td><td colspan="2">Conditional awareness</td></tr><tr><td>G1</td><td>G5</td><td>G1</td><td>G5</td><td>G1</td><td>G5</td></tr><tr><td>Week 8</td><td>Rhetorical sections (5) Rhetorical moves (7)</td><td>Rhetorical sections (1) Rhetorical moves (6)</td><td>Rhetorical sections (4) Rhetorical moves (2)</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Week 10</td><td></td><td></td><td>Rhetorical moves (4)</td><td></td><td>Rhetorical moves (1)</td><td>!</td></tr><tr><td>Week 12</td><td></td><td>Rhetorical sections (2)</td><td>Rhetorical sections (1)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Week 14</td><td></td><td>Rhetorical sections (1)</td><td>Rhetorical moves (4) Rhetorical moves (2)</td><td>Rhetorical moves (2)</td><td>Rhetorical moves (3)</td><td>!</td></tr><tr><td>Week 16</td><td>Rhetorical sections (2)</td><td>Rhetorical sections (1)</td><td>Rhetorical moves (1).</td><td>Rhetorical sections (1)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Week 18</td><td></td><td></td><td>Rhetorical sections (4)</td><td>Rhetorical sections (1)</td><td>Rhetorical sections (1)</td><td>Rhetorical sections (1)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 6 Extracts indicating Group $5 '$ developing awareness of rhetorical sections.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Categories</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Declarative awareness</td><td>Jack: It (Discussion) is just something put at the end of the text to .. emm, explain.

You must have read about it in the Data section.</td></tr><tr><td>Conditional awareness</td><td>(Group discussion transcripts, Week 16_Report 5) Owen: We could write the data of peer fedback (occurred in the Findings section) on the left column and the GOE framework (occurred in the Introduction section) on the right column to see the practical effect of the (theoretical) framework on interpreting data. (Group discussion transcripts, Week 18_Report 6)</td></tr></table></body></html>

As can be seen from Table 5, for rhetorical sections, both groups underwent a similar developmental pattern, as they all displayed conditional awareness at the end of the course, i.e., they gradually became able to rethink and reflect on their metacognitive knowledge of the research report genre. Table 6 presents extracts that indicate Group 5’s developing awareness of rhetorical sections.

The development of the awareness of rhetorical moves, however, differed somewhat from that of rhetorical sections. It was found that Group 1 had a greater awareness of rhetorical moves than Group 5, as the former showed more instances of conditional awareness. A plausible reason for this difference could be that Group 1 strictly followed the guiding questions listed in the outline, whereas Group 5 did not. Group 5 regarded these questions as “preliminary”, “only helpful” (Owen_Interview), “rigid” (Adam_Interview), and a “doctrine” (Owen_Interview) that they had to follow. As a result, there was a tacit agreement within Group 5 that they did not need to follow the guiding questions to organize their outlines and presentations (procedural awareness).

# 4.2.2. Academic language: Toward procedural awareness

As the course progressed, participants developed their procedural awareness of academic language, i.e. they became more familiar with some surface features of academic language. Table 7 shows the two groups’ developing awareness of academic language as expressed in group discussion.

For signal markers, both groups demonstrated procedural awareness as most participants reported in the interview that they could direct their attention to the right place in the report where some information was essential for understanding the text and completing the summarizing tasks. Ann from Group 1 commented that she was impressed by Tina’s great summarizing ability, especially her techniques for breaking down signal markers. Ann reflected on the gradual development of her awareness of signal markers, as shown in Extract 9.

# Extract 9 (Individual interview transcripts, Group 1)

Ann: I was lost in the information at the beginning (of this semester). I always translated the text (as much as possible) to inform my teammates (as they didn’t read the section I read), but the results were not good. (They couldn’t understand me).Time is so limited (that I couldn’t translate too much).I gradually imitated what Tina did (i.e., to only inform teammates of information indicated by signal markers).Afterwards, I found it was quite effective. I thought it (this way of summarizing) was incomplete, but for a summarizing task, that’s enough.

Table 7 Development of academic language awareness.

Extract 9 shows the development of Ann’s procedural awareness of signal markers. At first she thought that using signal markers to guide summarization was “incomplete” (Ann_Interview) and therefore she translated the text as much as possible (declarative awareness). Then she came to realize that this was inefficient, and as a result she gradually adopted Tina’s way of summarizing, using signal markers to organize the summarization. Eventually, she found that the latter approach facilitated her group’s comprehension and interpretation process. It was clear that Ann had already translated her metaknowledge of signal markers into comprehension and interpretation strategies (procedural awareness). However, when asked when and why signal markers might work differently (conditional awareness), Ann was unable to give detailed answers.

For decoding, both groups displayed procedural awareness as many students commented in the interview that decoding was not new to them because they had been “trained” for this “technique” in high school. As for general features, most participants developed only declarative awareness of general features since they could only talk about features in general terms and could not give full descriptions of how these features from the texts worked or functioned differently for their text comprehension compared to their pervious reading experience (procedural awareness).

# 4.2.3. Academic norms: Toward declarative awareness

Overall, the participants displayed declarative awareness of academic norms, and only a few participants developed conditional awareness of figures and tables. Table 8 shows the two groups’ developing awareness of academic norms.

For figures and tables, both groups displayed conditional awareness in the reading of the last report (Report 6). For example, Owen showed conditional awareness of tables, as illustrated in Extract 10.

# Extract 10 (Group discussion transcripts, Group 5, Week 18_Report 6)

Jennifer: I think we can actually write down our own experience on the poster.   
Owen: To compare it with our own evaluation?   
Jennifer: Yes, because we have innate advantages, that is, we also participated in it, right?   
Owen: Good. Then our posters could have some basic structures. Now there are two basic structures. Find one to start directly. The first one is to draw a timeline and divide it into three stages. (Referring to the timeline) This is the first stage, and this is our first stage; this is their second stage, and this is our second stage; this is their third stage, and this is our third stage. And then there’s the theory and how does it mirror the stage. Another structure is centered on this theory, and then each branch of it is actually the performance in that stage. For example, this branch is its first dimension, and then the performance of each stage is written on both sides. Jennifer: I think the first one is simpler.   
Ben: Good.

As can be seen in Extract 10, Owen made two suggestions for using tables to present their group’s poster, and the group members collectively decided to adopt the first structure because it was “simple and reader-friendly” (Jennifer_Interview). Owen’s suggestions clearly show that he had already developed conditional awareness of tables, which directed his analysis of the report’s content. Figure 2 demonstrates their conditional use of the table to present their poster.

However, analysis of the interview transcripts showed that only a few participants developed conditional awareness of tables and figures, although most developed procedural awareness. Specifically, they were able to apply their metacognitive knowledge of tables and figures to understand the authors’ “stream of thinking” (Michael) (procedural awareness), but they could not reflect on their metacognitive understanding of tables and figures in the semester’s collaborative academic reading (conditional awareness).

Figure 2. A poster on Report 6 (Group 5).

In terms of academic reasoning, both groups showed procedural awareness in group discussions and declarative awareness in interview transcripts. At the beginning of the course, participants were already aware of the specificity of argumentation in academic discourse. Over time, they came to realize that the scientific research report is not only informative but also communicative, persuasive and rhetorical. However, only a few participants could clearly explain how argumentation features functioned in their reading comprehension (procedural awareness) and most could only discuss what they had noticed and perceived about these features (declarative awareness).

For formatting conventions, most participants only developed declarative awareness. The analysis showed that most participants only noticed some formatting conventions, such as meta-information about a publication, and referencing styles and standards, and that some even tried to imitate the referencing style of the research reports they had read this semester (declarative awareness). However, they were unable to provide a meaningful explanation (procedural awareness).

# 5. Discussion and conclusion

The aim of this study was to explore what types of genre awareness novice academic learners acquired in collaborative academic reading and how such acquired genre awareness developed. Overall, the findings revealed that novice academic learners fostered three types of genre awareness, i.e., text structure, academic language, and academic norms, and the development of these three types followed different trajectories over one semester of collaborative academic reading at different metacognitive depths. The findings provide evidence for using a collaborative approach to foster genre awareness in the EFL context and a detailed description of how genre awareness can be acquired, built, and developed tacitly through reading exposure.

The present findings are significant in two aspects. On the one hand, the collaborative academic reading design, which is highly interactive and social, creates an ideal context that enables students to gain crucial entry to academic discourses (Jin et al., 2020; 2022; Paltridge, 2002). The three types of genre awareness developed in this study are consistent with the categorization of genre-specific knowledge reported in the literature (Negretti, 2015; Negretti and McGrath, 2018; Tardy, 2009; Wang, 2019) and with previous studies that have employed a metacognitive awareness framework to track the longitudinal development of participants’ genre knowledge (Negretti and Kuteeva, 2011; Wang, 2019; Yeh, 2015; Yoo, 2015). Most participants in this study also expressed appreciation for the collaborative process of deriving meaningful information from research reports, which facilitated the development of their genre awareness. This suggests that “a carefully designed and scaffolded genre awareness program” (Johns, 2008, p. 238) could provide novice academic learners with valuable opportunities for genre learning. The genre awareness developed could, in turn, enhance participants’ reading comprehension, helping them to look beyond the written words, improve their reading comprehension afterwards, and become more skilled and sensitive academic readers (Hyon, 2002). However, it should be noted that the role of group behavioral patterns in collaborative classrooms (Biasutti and Frate, 2018; Kiili and Leu, 2019) is a central factor. Recent research in educational psychology (Biasutti and Frate, 2018; Zhang and Zhang, 2019) and second language acquisition (Storch, 2017) has highlighted that learners with high metacognition tend to take advantage of group work to build collaborative relationships with their teammates. This may explain the facilitative role of collaboration in the development of genre awareness in the two focal groups, as participants were found to imitate their group members’ summarizing behaviors, use peer support to promote reading comprehension, and retrieve their previous reading experience of reading reports to build knowledge. These practices entailed collaboration and collective discussion, and increased group members’ metacognitive accuracy of the genre types (Kiili and Leu, 2019; Reiff and Bawarshi, 2011; Sato, 2021). This may also explain the differing developmental patterns between the two focal groups in the study d the development of Group 1 being more advanced than that of Group 5.

On the other hand, a careful design is needed to purposefully develop a particular facet of genre knowledge and a certain level of genre awareness in collaborative academic reading. One possible reason for the different development patterns of genre awareness in our study could be that it takes longer to develop conditional knowledge of genre per se. Another plausible reason is that the pedagogical design in the current context was collaborative, autonomous, open and exploratory (Jin et al., 2020), which to some extent emphasized the application of declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge of genre. Such a pedagogical design may have facilitated the declarative knowledge, procedural, and to some extent, conditional knowledge of novice academic readers, which contributed to their critical reading of research reports. These findings are in line with those of Negretti and Kuteeva (2011), who also found that most students in their EAP course only noticed genre-relevant features (declarative knowledge) or translated these features into interpretation strategies (procedural knowledge) with only a few coming to understand authors’ motives and techniques in utilizing particular genre features (conditional knowledge). Therefore, it is recommended to take advantage of the collaborative reading design to purposefully foster the higher-order metacognitive genre awareness, in particular the conditional knowledge.

The study has several limitations that should be noted. First, as a case study, the findings of the study should be considered as preliminary, exploratory, and by no means exhaustive (Yin, 2017). Second, due to the complex nature of genre awareness and the focus of this study, the interactions between the three types of genre awareness were not discussed. Future research could focus on these interactions and shed more light on the different facets of genre awareness. It would also be interesting to explore the difficulties and barriers that students may encounter in their acquisition and development of genre awareness, and/or to provide a more refined needs analysis of genre learning (Ohata and Fukao, 2014).

Despite these limitations, this study has provided insights into how novice academic learners’ genre awareness develops in a collaborative academic reading context. The genre awareness nurtured in the current study is evidence-based, collaboratively constructed, and facilitative for academic reading, specifically designed for novice academic readers. Such genre awareness nurturing is beneficial and constitutes a valuable stepping stone for participants to enter the academic community. These findings may help enhance our understanding of the intricate and multifarious aspects of genre awareness and academic literacy (Hedgcock and Lee, 2017), especially for novice academic learners in a collaborative learning environment (Johns, 2008; Ye, 2020). They also provide solid evidence for the practicality of implicit genre learning in the EFL context through collaborative academic reading practices (Hedgcock and Lee, 2017; Whitney et al., 2011).
