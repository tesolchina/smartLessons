Evidence from Canada suggests that accent bias can be moderated by speakers’ demonstrated job-relevant performance and the prestige level of their occupation (Teló et al. 2022). In this study, we replicated Teló et al.’s (2022) work in Brazil. First language (L1) Brazilian Portuguesespeaking listeners rated audio recordings of L1 Brazilian Portuguese and L1 Spanish speakers along continua capturing one professional (competence), one experiential (treatment preference), and one linguistic (comprehensibility) dimension. Our fndings challenge the notion of consistent bias, as listeners did not uniformly perceive L1 Brazilian Portuguese speakers as more competent and comprehensible than L1 Spanish speakers, and, in fact, generally preferred treatment provided by L1 Spanish speakers. Complex interactions provided a nuanced account of listeners’ evaluations, revealing, among other patterns, that demonstrated performance level and job prestige affected the evaluated dimensions differently depending on the speaker’s L1. This replication further expands the initial study by examining the role of four listener variables as predictors of speaker ratings. Greater listener familiarity with the context depicted in the script was associated with the assignment of higher ratings overall.

# Introduction

Accent bias—the unfair treatment one receives based on their accent—is pervasive. Second language (L2) speakers whose L2 accent is infuenced by their previously known languages (henceforth referred to as L2-accented speakers) face prejudice and discrimination, including in professional settings (Lippi-Green 2012). While the sources of negative language attitudes can be multiple, including intergroup processes such as categorization and stereotyping (Ryan 1983) and fuency-based factors such as processing fuency (comprehensibility; Dragojevic and Giles 2016), they result in negative consequences for L2-accented speakers. For example, they are frequently perceived as less intelligent, trustworthy, credible, and competent than frst language (L1) speakers (e.g. Lindemann 2003; Lev-Ari and Keysar 2010; Baquiran and Nicoladis 2020). These biased evaluations can substantially impact the professional integration of L2-accented speakers. In fact, recent meta-analytic evidence (Spence et al. 2024) shows that L2-accented speakers are systematically perceived as less employable than L1-speaking candidates. Adding nuance to this pattern, research further suggests that occupational characteristics can affect professional-related evaluations assigned to L2-accented speakers, who are often preferred for low-prestige positions (e.g. Kalin and Rayko 1978; Singer and Eder 1989) and those with lower communication demands (e.g. Lindberg and Trofmovich 2023; Spence et al. 2024).

Until recently, however, it was unclear whether and how listeners consider a speaker’s job performance or skill level when evaluating the speaker, such that accent bias may interact with speakers’ demonstrated job-relevant performance/skill level. To address this gap, Teló et al. (2022) examined listeners’ evaluations of L1 and L2 English speakers assuming the role of professionals performing more or less skillfully in jobs that also differed in prestige. English-speaking listeners from Calgary (Canada) rated recordings of L1 English and Tagalog speakers along three continua capturing one professional (competence), one experiential (treatment preference; i.e. the extent to which the listener wished to be treated as described in the script), and one linguistic (comprehensibility, i.e. ease of understanding) dimension. Data were analyzed with generalized linear mixed-effects models controlling for the number of languages known by the listeners and their familiarity with L2-accented speech. Overall, L1 English speakers were rated higher than L1 Tagalog speakers on all dimensions. Predictably, high-prestige jobs (doctor, lawyer, professor) and high-performance scenarios tended to be evaluated more favorably than low-prestige jobs (cleaner, salesperson, server) and low-performance scenarios. Nonetheless, three-way interactions among speaker L1, job prestige, and performance level revealed a nuanced picture of accent bias against L2-accented speakers, who were perceived just as competent as and received similar preference ratings to L1 English speakers when job prestige and/or professional performance was low. These fndings suggest that listeners may have assumed that Tagalog speakers were particularly suited for low-paying, low-prestige jobs, and that poor professional performance was associated with speakers in such positions.

Notwithstanding their contribution, Teló et al.’s (2022) fndings are likely contextual. The authors propose, for example, that it is probable that listeners’ ratings were infuenced by their experience with L2-accented speakers in low-paying, low-prestige positions, or by their expectations regarding the jobs and skills usually associated with those speakers. This raises the question of whether similar fndings would be obtained in a country with a different linguistic landscape and a smaller immigration infux, which may affect people’s experience with newcomers and the power relations between local-born, L1-speaking individuals and foreign-born, L2-speaking individuals. This motivated the current replication study in Brazil.

While Canada welcomed more than 400,000 new permanent residents in 2021 (representing over $1 . 0 8 \%$ of its population), just over 150,000 people immigrated to Brazil in the same period, constituting $0 . 0 7 \%$ of its population. Between 2011 and 2021, the Brazilian job market witnessed a substantial increase in the number of immigrants formally employed, with most of them residing in southern states and working in low-paying occupations (Cavalcanti et al. 2022). Recently, Venezuela, Haiti, and Cuba have led immigration, with most employed immigrant women in 2021 coming from Spanish-speaking countries (Cavalcanti et al. 2022). Similarly to other contexts, immigrants in Brazil contend not only with broader forms of discrimination but also grapple with linguistic prejudices (Bueno 2018; Mundin and Santos 2022), where the commonly held view of linguistic unity and homogeneity (Bagno 1999) may exacerbate stereotypes and misconceptions about the profciency and intelligibility of L2-accented speakers (Hamel 2013; Rodrigues 2014).

The present study aims to conceptually replicate and extend Teló et al.’s (2022) study in Brazil, an under-investigated context in accent bias research. Because most recent immigrants in Brazil are from Spanish-speaking countries and settle in southern states (Cavalcanti et al. 2022), we decided to investigate how L1 Brazilian Portuguese (BP) listeners, residents of the State of Santa Catarina, in the south of Brazil, evaluate L2 BP speakers with L1 Spanish in workplace-relevant contexts. We address the following research question: How are listeners’ professional (competence), experiential (treatment preference), and linguistic (comprehensibility) reactions to speakers in job scenarios associated with speakers’ linguistic background (Brazilian Portuguese vs.

Spanish), job prestige (high vs. low), and performance level (high vs. low)? Beyond the two control covariates originally analyzed (number of languages known, L2 accent familiarity), we included two additional control covariates in our models: listeners’ familiarity with the context of each script and listeners’ ethnic pride. First, Teló et al. (2022) attribute some of their fndings to the possibility that listeners’ experience with L1 and L2 speakers in certain positions infuenced their evaluations. Second, Santa Catarina is known for leaning toward right-wing ideologies (Singer 2021), and was predominantly settled by European immigrants, primarily of German and Italian descent (e.g. Seyferth 2011), with numerous studies highlighting the strong ethnic pride and cultural identity maintained by these communities (e.g. Rinke 2014). Therefore, by incorporating these control covariates, we aim to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the factors possibly infuencing speaker evaluations.

Based on previous research and the sociocultural context in Santa Catarina, we expected L1 Spanish speakers to receive more negative evaluations compared to L1 BP speakers. Moreover, building upon Teló et al.’s (2022) fndings, we hypothesized that speakers in high-prestige jobs and those demonstrating high professional performance would generally receive more favorable evaluations. Finally, we posited that listeners’ ethnic pride may act as a moderating factor in L2 accent bias, such that individuals with higher levels of ethnic pride may exhibit accent bias to a greater extent, as they may hold stronger preconceived notions about the suitability of certain linguistic backgrounds for particular job roles. We have labeled this study a conceptual replication given our ‘intentional adaptation of the initial study to investigate generalizability to new conditions’ (Marsden et al. 2018: 235).

# Method

All the Brazilian Portuguese materials, except for the recordings, as well as the data that informed our fndings, are available on https://osf.io/z3uak/.

# Recordings

The recordings were collected by presenting speakers with 12 scripted scenarios narrated by a hypothetical professional. Half of the scenarios depicted low-prestige jobs (cleaner, salesperson, server), while the other half depicted high-prestige jobs (doctor, lawyer, professor). Although occupational prestige may vary between Canada and Brazil, we used the same jobs as in the original study because they presumably are still low- versus high-prestige professions in Brazil. Moreover, the low-prestige occupations included are closely related to the most common occupations held by immigrant women in Brazil, which are cleaner, butcher, salesperson, and other professions related to the industry and food chains (Cavalcanti et al. 2022). Within each profession, one script represented high-level performance, while the other portrayed low-level performance by the professional. For example, the high-performance doctor script featured a phone message to a patient. The doctor explained the results of the patient’s lab tests in a detailed manner using layperson-friendly language and informed them that a prescription was ready due to the indication of an infection. Conversely, the low-performance doctor script provided similar information but with medical jargon and uncertainty regarding the test results. The terms ‘high-level performance’ and ‘low-level performance’ used here broadly refer to better and worse professional performance, respectively.

The scripts used were translations and adaptations of those originally employed. Adaptions considered the situations and language that residents of Santa Catarina might encounter in their interactions with the selected professionals. For example, while in the original study the speaker took on the role of a client relations professional when reading the scripts associated with a cleaner, the professional depicted in the adapted script was the cleaner herself. This adaptation assumed that the interactions between customers and cleaners are not typically mediated by a third party in Brazil. Regarding linguistic differences, because cross-cultural differences may generate different language use in terms of assertiveness and politeness, for example (Thomas,

1983; Mendes de Oliveira, 2015), a noteworthy adaptation concerns the use of less ‘direct’ or ‘blunt’ language, as judged by the researchers, especially in the scripts illustrating low-level performance. To ensure that the scripts portrayed different performance levels, four L1 BP residents of Santa Catarina assessed the scripts’ overall quality and provided comments. Based on this initial feedback, the scripts were revised and subsequently evaluated by 13 additional L1 BP raters, who used 9-point scales $1 = n 0 t$ at all, $9 =$ very much) to assess the person depicted in the script for pleasantness, job effectiveness, and sensitivity to the needs of others. Compared to lowperformance scripts, high-performance scripts illustrated a professional who was more pleasant $( M = 8 . 4 7$ vs. 5.71), $t ( 1 5 4 ) = 9 . 7 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , effective $( M = 8 . 4 4$ vs. 5.24), $\operatorname { t } ( 1 5 4 ) = 1 1 . 6$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , and sensitive to the needs of others $( M = 8 . 1 1$ vs. 5.05), $\ t ( 1 5 4 ) = 1 0 . 0 7$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ .

The fnal version of the scripts, which had 107.5 words on average $\left( S D = 8 . 2 3 \right)$ ), was recorded by six individuals residing in Santa Catarina, three L1 BP and three L1 Spanish speakers, using their phones. We included only female speakers to simplify the experimental design (see below).1 The speakers were recruited through word of mouth and instructed to familiarize themselves with the passages. They were directed to read each script naturally and to speak at a normal pace, with the opportunity to record each passage multiple times. The fnal selection of the recordings included those that had the most suitable pace and most natural fow as evaluated by the researchers. The speakers $( M _ { a g e } = 3 9 . 6$ , $S D = 1 5 . 6 )$ were all residents of Santa Catarina. The L1 BP speakers were either born and raised in the state or lived most of their lives there. The Spanish speakers were from different Latin American countries (Chile, Colombia, Cuba). The phonological inventories of BP and Latin American Spanish (LAS) differ remarkably in terms of vowels (e.g. BP has more vowels, including an open/closed vowel contrast for mid-front and mid-back oral vowels, and nasal vowels). Conversely, consonants are similar overall, with a few exceptions (e.g. the BP rhotic is mostly a fricative, while the LAS rhotic is a trill; BP has a voiced/voiceless contrast for alveolar fricatives, while LAS has only the voiceless counterpart; LAS has a voiceless affricate, which is an allophone in BP; BP has two palatal fricatives). Despite these and other phonotactic differences and allophonic variations in BP and LAS, the three varieties of Spanish used in this study should not result in noticeable phonological differences among the productions by the L1 Spanish speakers.

Finally, we examined the ratings of accentedness provided by the 60 listeners as part of the experimental procedure (see below). The ratings assigned to the Spanish speakers ranged between 1 and 97 $( M = 4 0 . 8 7 ,$ ) on a 100-point scale, where 100 represented no accent at all. The ratings given to the BP speakers ranged between 20 and 100 $( M = 9 1 . 2 7 ) $ ), with a reliable difference between the two sets, $\mathrm { t } ( 3 5 8 ) = 2 5 . 8 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $M _ { d i f f } = 5 0 . 4 1$ , $9 5 \%$ CI [46.57, 54.21], $d = 1 8 . 5 1$ . Therefore, to the extent that accentedness ratings capture variations in pronunciation (at the levels of segments and prosody) and voice quality (Derwing and Munro 2015), the recordings by L1 and L2 BP speakers appeared to demonstrate distinct pronunciation performances.

# Listeners

To evaluate the audios, 60 listeners $( M _ { a g e } = 2 0 . 9 0$ , $S D = 9 . 8 9$ , $\operatorname* { m i n } = 1 8$ , $\mathrm { \ m a x } = 6 5$ ) were recruited through social media and word of mouth, with inclusion criteria being age (18 or over) and residence (Santa Catarina). All listeners had L1 BP and hailed from 16 cities across the state. Listeners reported using BP in speaking 94.82 percent of the time, on average $\left( { \mathrm { S D } } = 1 1 . 6 7 \right) ,$ ). The largest group of listeners $( N = 1 7$ , $2 8 \%$ ) reported knowing three languages; 36 listeners reported knowing one, two, or four languages, with 12 listeners $( 2 0 \% )$ in each of these categories; seven listeners $( 1 2 \% )$ reported knowing fve languages. They self-rated their familiarity with L2-accented BP with a mean score of 4.97 $( S D = 2 . 5 5 $ ) on a scale ranging from 1 (not familiar at all) to 9 (very familiar). Listeners also provided information about their ethnicity through an open-ended question. Most listeners $( N = 2 6$ , $4 3 \%$ ) indicated ‘European’ as their ethnic group; 6 listeners $( 1 0 \% )$ indicated ‘White’ or ‘Caucasian’ as their ethnicity. The remaining listeners who answered this question reported affliation to the following ethnic groups: ‘Latin American’ $( \mathrm { N } = 5 )$ ), ‘Brazilian’ $( \mathrm { N } = 5 )$ , ‘Brown’ or ‘mixed race’ $( N = 3 )$ , ‘Indigenous/European’ $\left( \mathrm { N } = 2 \right)$ , ‘Indigenous’ $( N = 1 )$ , ‘African’ $( N = 1 )$ , and ‘Asian’ $\left( \mathrm { N } = 1 \right)$ ). All but two listeners reported having normal hearing; because excluding those listeners’ data resulted in no change in the fndings, the entire listener sample was considered for analysis. In contrast to Teló et al. (2022), who compensated their listeners with $\mathrm { C A D } \$ 30$ , the listeners in the present replication received no compensation, in accordance with the research ethics guidelines in Brazil.

# Materials and procedures

Listeners evaluated the recordings remotely, using a Qualtrics web-based interface. The interface included audio recordings followed by several 100-point sliding scales containing endpoint descriptors only. Three scales aimed to capture listeners’ professional, experiential, and linguistic reactions to speakers. The professional scale assessed the perceived competence of the speaker (This person seems competent… not at all – very much). The experiential scale gauged the extent to which listeners desired to be treated as described in the script (I would want to be treated as described in this script… not at all – very much). The linguistic scale focused on the speaker’s comprehensibility (This person is… hard to understand – easy to understand). An additional scale targeted speakers’ accentedness, to capture between-speaker variation in pronunciation (This person is … heavily accented – not accented at all). Comprehensibility and accentedness were defned for listeners as in the original study (the degree of effort it takes to understand the speaker and the degree to which the pronunciation deviates from the expected native-speaker variety, respectively). The remaining ratings were presented without a specifc defnition but were preceded by a contextualizing sentence (e.g. This person seems competent).

The fnal set of recordings comprised 24 fles, with each of the six speakers contributing audios for one high-prestige job (low- and high-level performance) and one low-prestige job (low- and high-level performance), totaling four audios per speaker. To ensure that no listener evaluated high- and low-performance scenarios for the same job, heard the same speaker’s voice twice, or heard an unbalanced number of L1 versus L2 speaker recordings, we organized the 24 audios (6 speakers $\times 4$ scripts) in four balanced experimental lists containing six scripts each. Across all lists, listeners heard each speaker in a high- and a low-prestige job and illustrating high- and low-level performance. However, within each list, listeners experienced a subset of the recordings that ensured equal distribution of speaker L1 (3 BP, 3 Spanish), occupations (6 jobs), and performance levels (3 high-, 3 low-performance scenarios). As the present replication only includes female speakers, we were able to streamline the experimental design, such that the 60 listeners were randomly assigned to one of the four versions of the interface, with numerically more listeners (15) rating each set of audios compared to the initial study.

Prior to completing the rating task, listeners flled out a consent form and a language background questionnaire. Listeners then completed a practice block where they evaluated three L2 BP speakers of different L1 backgrounds (not Spanish) for accentedness and comprehensibility, receiving brief feedback following each evaluation to help listeners contemplate the difference between the concepts (e.g. We believe you made considerable effort to understand the message. We expect your rating to fall in the frst half or quarter of the scale). Although Teló et al. (2022) acknowledge that such feedback may impact listeners’ ratings, we opted for including it to ensure that listeners distinguished between accentedness and comprehensibility. In the main rating task, which included six scenarios presented in randomized order, listeners frst read a brief description contextualizing each situation (e.g. You have just phoned an electronics store to ask about the best tablet for your child. The person who received your call left the following voice message for you). Listeners then clicked on the recording to initiate playback. After hearing the audio for the frst time, they rated the speaker for comprehensibility and accentedness. They then listened to the audio a second time and provided competence and treatment preference evaluations. Listeners had the opportunity to provide comments explaining their ratings. No repeated playback was allowed after the second listening.

# Data analysis

The analyses from Teló et al. (2022) were replicated almost identically, except for the inclusion of two new control covariates. To ensure internal consistency, all ratings were frst checked using two-way, consistency, average-measure intraclass correlations (ICCs) calculated with the psych package (version 2.3.6; Revelle 2023) in R (version 4.3.0; R Core Team 2023). The ICC values for the full dataset indicated high consistency for the ratings of competence (.94), treatment preference (.95), and comprehensibility (.97).

Generalized linear mixed-effects models were then ft using the lme4 package (version 1.1.33; Bates et al. 2015). To accommodate the nature of the data, which consisted of integers with fxed upper and lower bounds, the target ratings were transformed into proportions using min-max normalization. A binomial distribution with a logit link function was then used in the modeling of the data, which is an appropriate choice when the response variable is a proportion (Baum 2008). For each model, we conducted 100,000 iterations using the BOBYQA optimizer, with the number of adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature points (nAGQ) set to zero. Listener and speaker served as random intercepts. The following variables were used as fxed-effects predictors: (i) speaker L1 (BP or Spanish), (ii) accentedness ratings (continuous, included to capture between-speaker variation in L2 accent), (iii) job prestige (high or low), (iv) performance level (high or low), (v) interaction term between speaker L1 and accentedness rating, (vi) interaction term between speaker L1 and job prestige, (vii) interaction term between speaker L1 and performance level, and (viii) three-way interaction term among speaker L1, job prestige, and performance level. Categorical variables were dummy-coded.

Following the original study, all models included the number of languages listeners reported knowing (1–5 in our dataset) and their familiarity with L2-accented speech (1–9 scalar rating) as control covariates in their fxed-effects structure.2 Because Teló et al. (2022) highlight the possibility that listeners’ experience with L1 and L2 speakers in certain positions affects their evaluations, we included a control covariate capturing listeners’ familiarity with the context depicted in each script. This rating was collected as part of the experimental procedure (How familiar are you with the context described in this script … not at all – very much), and indicted that listeners were relatively familiar with the contexts $( M = 6 9 . 7 5 $ , $S D = 2 8 . 2 7 ,$ . Furthermore, in light of the raciolinguistic component of accent, we included a control covariate capturing listeners’ ethnic pride. Listeners’ ethnic pride was estimated with fve positively-oriented items (e.g., I am proud to be a member of my ethnic group; I am proud of the achievements of my ethnic group) adapted from Taylor Reid et al. (2019) and translated into BP. The fve indicator items were deemed reliable (Cronbach’s alpha $= . 8 8 \AA$ ). On average, listeners reported ethnic pride levels around the mid-point of the scale $( M = 5 . 8 6$ , $S D = 2 . 2 5$ ). Correlations between the response variables and the control covariates are available in Supplementary Table 1 of the Supplementary Data and Information.

Despite having 360 observations for each response variable, the lme4 function used row-wise deletion to handle missing values. In the end, there were 351 observations for each rating. To assess the statistical signifcance of each parameter, we examined the p-values calculated by the lmerTest package (version 3.1.3; Kuznetsova et al. 2017) and inspected bootstrapped $9 5 \%$ confdence intervals (CIs). To explore signifcant interaction effects, post hoc comparisons were conducted using the emmeans package (version 1.8.7; Lenth 2023), with p-values adjusted using the Tukey method.

# Results

The research question aimed to investigate how listeners’ professional (competence), experiential (treatment preference), and linguistic (comprehensibility) evaluations are associated with speakers’ L1 (BP vs. Spanish), job prestige (high vs. low), and performance level (high vs. low). Additionally, the analysis accounted for between-speaker variation in pronunciation by considering the accentedness ratings. The target variables are summarized descriptively in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 of the Supplementary Data and Information.

# Competence

As summarized in Table 1, for the ratings of speaker competence, there were signifcant main effects for accentedness and performance level. Listeners generally evaluated speakers who were rated as having a weaker accent as more competent than those rated as having a stronger accent. Listeners also tended to rate all speakers (regardless of their L1) as more competent in high-level performance scenarios than in low-level performance scenarios. While speaker L1 per se was not signifcant, the effect for speaker L1 was qualifed by an interaction with performance and by an interaction with prestige, signifying that specifc combinations of speaker L1 and performance/prestige level affected listeners’ evaluations in unique ways. Nonetheless, due to the involvement of these predictors in a statistically signifcant three-way interaction among speaker L1, performance level, and job prestige (which indicates that all three variables interacted with each other to infuence competence ratings; see full comparison details below), the interpretation of main effects and two-way interactions may be misleading. The only control covariate that emerged as signifcant was context familiarity, indicating that stronger context familiarity was associated with higher competence ratings.

The three-way interaction among speaker L1, performance, and prestige (Figure 1) does not reveal any signifcant differences in competence ratings when L1 BP and Spanish speakers are compared directly across scenarios. Nonetheless, while L1 BP speakers received comparable competence ratings in high- and low-prestige scenarios at a given performance level, Spanish speakers were rated more competent in low- than high-prestige jobs if their performance level was high, $z = - 9 . 9 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , and in high-prestige jobs (over low-prestige jobs) when the performance level was low, $z = 5 . 9 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . Moreover, all speakers (regardless of their L1 and of the prestige level of the job) received statistically higher competence ratings when illustrating a high-level performance in comparison with low-level performance. However, job-relevant performance made a bigger difference to the competence ratings of L1 Spanish speakers, $z = 2 6 . 1 7$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , than to the ratings of L1 BP speakers, $z = 1 7 . 0 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , in low-prestige jobs, but it made more of a difference to the ratings of L1 BP speakers, $z = 1 6 . 5 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , than to the ratings of L1 Spanish speakers, $z = 1 2 . 2 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , in high-prestige jobs.

# Treatment preference

As summarized in Table 2, for the ratings of listener treatment preference, there were signifcant main effects for speaker L1, accentedness, job prestige, and performance level. Overall, listeners gave higher preference ratings for L1 Spanish than L1 BP speakers, but also gave higher ratings to speakers who were rated as having a weaker accent in comparison to those whose accent was rated as stronger. Listeners generally assigned higher preference ratings to all speakers (regardless of their L1) in low-prestige jobs, while low-skill performances elicited lower treatment preference ratings overall. The effect for speaker L1 was qualifed by an interaction with accentedness rating, where the difference in treatment preference ratings between L1 BP and Spanish speakers widened as the speaker was rated to have a stronger accent. The effect for speaker L1 was further qualifed by an interaction with performance level, signifying that certain combinations of speaker L1 and performance level infuenced listeners’ evaluations differently. However, because some of these predictors are involved in a statistically signifcant three-way interaction among speaker L1, performance level, and job prestige (meaning that these three variables interacted with each other to infuence treatment preference ratings; see full comparison details below), the interpretation of main effects and two-way interactions may be misleading. The only control covariate that emerged as signifcant was context familiarity, indicating that stronger context familiarity was associated with higher treatment preference ratings.

Note. The reference level for speaker L1 is Brazilian Portuguese. The reference level for prestige is high. The reference level for performance is high.

The three-way interaction among speaker L1, performance, and prestige (Figure 2) shows that in high-performance, high-prestige scenarios, L1 Spanish speakers received higher treatment preference ratings than BP speakers, $z = - 2 . 6 2$ , $p = . 0 0 9$ , while in low-performance, low-prestige scenarios, L1 BP speakers were the ones who were assigned higher ratings, $z = 2 . 0 0$ , $p =$ .045. L1 BP and Spanish speakers received comparable ratings in low-performance, high-prestige scenarios, $z = - 1 . 8 0$ , $p = . 0 7 2$ , and in high-performance, low-prestige scenarios, $z = - 1 . 7 7$ , $p = . 0 7 7$ . Beyond these direct comparisons between speaker groups, all speakers received higher ratings when in a low-prestige job than in a high-prestige job regardless of their L1 and performance level. The effect of prestige on treatment preference ratings of L1 BP, $z = - 5 . 7 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , and L1 Spanish speakers, $z = - 3 . 3 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , was similar when the performance level demonstrated by the speaker was high. However, when the speaker demonstrated low-level performance, the effect of job prestige was greater for L1 BP, $Z = - 1 8 . 9 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , than for L1 Spanish speakers, $Z =$ –3.92, $p < . 0 0 1$ . Similarly, all speakers received higher ratings when illustrating high-level performance than low-level performance regardless of their L1 and of the prestige of the job, but with notable differences in the effect of performance level. Overall, performance level made a bigger difference to the treatment preference ratings of the L1 Spanish speakers than to the ratings of the L1 BP speakers, with this difference being magnifed in low-prestige scenarios, $z = 2 9 . 5 0$ , $p <$ .001 and $z = 1 8 . 2 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , respectively, in comparison to high-prestige scenarios, $z = 3 1 . 4 1$ , $p <$ .001 and $z = 2 7 . 2 7$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , respectively.

# Comprehensibility

As summarized in Table 3, for the ratings of comprehensibility, there was only a signifcant main effect of accentedness, such that speakers rated as having weaker accents were judged as easier to understand than those rated as having stronger accents. The effect of speaker L1 was qualifed by an interaction with accentedness, where the difference in comprehensibility ratings between BP and Spanish speakers widened as the speaker’s accent was judged to be stronger. The effect of speaker L1 was further qualifed by an interaction with prestige, signifying that the combination of these two variables affected comprehensibility ratings (see full comparison details below). Context familiarity approached signifcance at the fve percent threshold, indicating that stronger context familiarity was associated with higher comprehensibility ratings.

Note. The reference level for speaker L1 is Brazilian Portuguese. The reference level for prestige is high. The reference level for performance is high.

The only signifcant interactions (Figure 3) that emerged in the comprehensibility model were between speaker L1 and accentedness and between speaker L1 and prestige. Notably, while L1 BP speakers received higher comprehensibility ratings when performing high-prestige jobs in comparison with low-prestige jobs, $z = 2 . 6 2$ , $p =$ .009, L1 Spanish speakers were judged more comprehensible when performing low-prestige jobs in comparison with high-prestige jobs, $z = - 8 . 3 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . Further comparisons between the speaker groups in each prestige level revealed that in high-prestige scenarios, L1 BP speakers were perceived as signifcantly more comprehensible than L1 Spanish speakers, $z = 5 . 1 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , while both speaker groups received comparable comprehensibility ratings in low-prestige scenarios, $z = 1 . 5 6$ , $p = . 1 1 9$ .

# Discussion

We aimed to replicate and extend Teló et al. (2022), who showed that accent bias may be more nuanced than generally assumed by exploring the effects of job prestige and professional performance in the ratings of speaker competence, listener treatment preference, and speaker comprehensibility. We replicated the study in Brazil, a different linguistic setting that is marked by a smaller immigration infux, where the interactions between local- and foreign-born individuals are likely more limited in comparison to those commonly observed in Canada, and where the power dynamics between L1 and L2 speakers may be different from those experienced by interlocutors in Canada. Methodologically, we departed from the initial study in three key ways, one of which amounts to an extension of the initial study: First, we included only female speakers in the current replication. This decision aligns with recent studies on accent bias (e.g. Lindberg and Trofmovich 2023) and streamlined the procedures for data collection, allowing us to recruit fewer participants than Teló et al. (2022) while simultaneously collecting more ratings for each recording. Second, because it was important to ensure the coherence and relevance of the scripted content, our script adaptation process encompassed qualitative adjustments. Lastly, a notable addition to our analysis involved the inclusion of two new control covariates, one capturing listeners’ familiarity with the context depicted in each script and another capturing listeners’ ethnic pride.

# Summary of fndings

Collectively, our fndings underscore the complicated nature of accent bias, revealing complexities that surpass the insights from the initial study. For instance, Teló et al. (2022) identifed speaker L1 as a signifcant predictor across all models, signifying that listeners generally perceived L1 English speakers as more competent and comprehensible than L2 English speakers, and that listeners generally wished to be treated as presented in scripts recorded by L1 versus L2 speakers. Here, this signifcance was not replicated across the models examining competence and comprehensibility, suggesting that the weight tied to speaker L1 alone was diminished, resulting in listeners not uniformly perceiving L1 BP speakers as more competent and comprehensible than L2 BP speakers. This difference across the studies is potentially related to the target languages, which in our study were Romance languages, likely contributing to mutual intelligibility. Furthermore, it may refect the power differential between L1 BP and L1 Spanish speakers in Brazil, which is presumably different from the power imbalance observed between L1 English and L1 Tagalog speakers in Canada (Pennycook, 2010; Liddicoat, 2016). Additionally, in our treatment preference model, a divergence from the outcomes of the initial study surfaced: Listeners generally indicated a preference for treatment aligned with recordings from L2 BP speakers (see detailed discussion below). This unexpected twist implies that L1 background may interact with other (contextual, vocal) cues in unforeseen ways.

Beyond L1 per se, the listeners in the current replication exhibited a heightened effect of speakers’ accentedness; in fact, this was the only variable that consistently emerged as signifcant across all models. Speakers who were rated as having weaker accents were judged as more competent and comprehensible compared to those who were rated as having stronger accents. This trend also extended to treatment preference ratings, where speakers with less prominent accents were favored. While this fnding clearly implies a gradient (rather than categorical) infuence of accent on evaluations (Ryan et al. 1977), it likely stems from the Spanish speakers’ pronunciation posing little or virtually no diffculty of understanding to L1 BP-speaking listeners, given the degree of similarity between the phonological inventories of the two languages. It is possible that, because the L2 BP speakers were rated as comprehensible as the L1 BP speakers, listeners paid greater attention to (and were more critical of) speakers’ accentedness, once it was the only linguistic dimension that set L1 and L2 speakers apart. Regardless, listeners favoring weaker accents over stronger accents (both in the initial study and here) is supported by previous research showing that customers prefer to interact with professionals with weaker accents (Tsunemoto et al. 2023). Additionally, it might suggest that listeners perceive more ‘nativelike’ accents (i.e. more phonetic-phonologically similar to the target language) as indicative of better communication profciency (Derwing and Munro 2009). In turn, listeners may have upgraded these speakers assuming that they were professionals who possess valuable workplace characteristics, such as dynamism, sense of initiative, and leadership skills (Beaulieu et al. 2022). On a theoretical level, we may assume that the linguistic similarity between BP and Spanish yields high levels of speaker comprehensibility, which, according to the processing fuency account of accent discrimination (Dragojevic and Giles 2016), should result in lower levels of accent discrimination overall in the present study when compared to the initial study. While our results may, indeed, demonstrate this to a certain extent, it is noteworthy that even though the listeners perceived the L1 and the L2 speakers comparably comprehensible, they showed clear accent-based biases. This provides support for categorization and stereotyping accounts of accent discrimination (e.g., Ryan 1983).

Lastly, refecting the built-in manipulation of job-relevant performance level, listeners rated all speakers (irrespective of their L1 and of the prestige level of the job) as more competent in high- versus low-level performance scenarios. Similarly, regardless of speakers’ L1 and the prestige of the job, listeners expressed a stronger preference to be treated in accordance with the high-performance scenarios rather than the low-performance counterparts. These fndings, which were generally in line with those of the initial study, were obtained after we statistically controlled four variables capturing individual differences in the number of languages known by the listeners and their accent familiarity (as in Teló et al. 2022), and their context familiarity and ethnic pride. In what follows, we discuss the fndings that are meaningful when the full dataset is considered (i.e. based on the three-way interactions, whenever they were statistically signifcant).

# Competence and treatment preference

Beyond the patterns described above, the relative effects of performance level and job prestige on listeners’ ratings reveal important distinctions between L1 and L2 speakers, including in the types of jobs and performances that listeners associate with L1 and L2 speakers, which constitutes linguistic bias. For example, regarding competence, when L1 Spanish speakers demonstrated high-level performance, they elicited higher competence ratings in low-prestige jobs than in high-prestige jobs. This might have tapped into listeners’ assumptions about L2 speakers (e.g. Russo et al. 2017), such that they were perceived as more competent in low-stakes, low-prestige jobs even when other L2 speakers were depicted as skillful professionals in high-status jobs. Similarly, hearing L2 speakers in low-status jobs potentially tapped into listeners’ expectations about or experience with immigrants doing low-status, low-paying jobs well—as reported in previous research in Brazil, for example, Tedesco and Grzybrovski 2012—leading to higher competence ratings. These patterns aside, when L2 speakers’ performance level was low, they were rated more competent in high-prestige scenarios compared to low-prestige scenarios, perhaps because individuals require greater competence (e.g. success in education) to attain the high-prestige jobs included in the study (doctor, lawyer, professor). It is noteworthy that none of this was true for L1 BP speakers, whose competence ratings remained comparable across the different scenarios, with only a high- versus low-performance distinction.

In a greater degree of nuance than that discussed in Teló et al. (2022), our analyses further show that job-relevant performance affected listeners’ ratings differently depending on the speaker’s L1 and the prestige of the job. In summary, when speakers took on the role of a professional in a low-prestige job, performance made a bigger difference to the competence and treatment preference ratings of L2 speakers than to the ratings of L1 speakers. Conversely, when job prestige was high, the impact of performance on perceived competence (but not treatment preference) was more pronounced for L1 speakers. Broadly, this provides additional evidence that listeners may have different expectations for L1 and L2 speaker (Lindemann and Subtirelu 2013), including in the workplace (Russo et al., 2017), creating a bias in how performance is perceived, evaluated, and, perhaps, processed (Ridgway 1991; Foschi 2013), especially in jobs with varying prestige levels (Kalin and Rayko 1978; Singer and Eder 1989). In the case of competence specifcally, this fnding indicates that listeners may hold different competence standards, applying stricter or more lenient performance standards to individuals based on factors such as their ethnicity, place of origin, and socioeconomic class, as well as based on the social interaction context (e.g. Biernat and Kobrynowicz 1997; Foschi 2000).

Regarding listener treatment preference specifcally, these ratings showed a more straightforward effect of speaker L1, with L2 BP speakers generally receiving higher preference ratings than L1 BP speakers, which is strikingly different from the results of the initial study. This fnding may imply that listeners valued certain communication styles and/or pronunciation features associated with the L2 speakers, which is underscored by communication- and speech-related comments provided by listeners to elucidate their evaluation of scenarios involving low-level performance presented by Spanish speakers. Comments such as ‘She lacks knowledge about her feld of work, but she’s polite and friendly’ and ‘This person uses a very graceful way of speaking’ indicate that listeners may have drawn upon various linguistic elements, including pronunciation but extending beyond mere accent, to formulate their treatment preference judgments. This phenomenon is akin to how listeners often associate certain speech features with personal traits, leading to diverse behavioral responses toward those speakers (e.g., Fasoli et al. 2017; Pearsell and Pape 2023). Other comments suggest that listeners may have been positively infuenced by the profciency level exhibited by the L2 BP speakers, thus rewarding them in comparison to L1 BP speakers, whose ‘nativelike’ linguistic performance was already expected and thus not surprising (Teló et al. 2024). This is demonstrated, for instance, in a comment provided by a listener upon hearing a recording of an L2 BP speaker: ‘Polite vocabulary. The message has a logical continuity that proves good reasoning and fuency. It gives the impression that she thinks in Portuguese, almost like a native speaker. The use of an expression in the diminutive shows that she is used to the popular lexicon of Brazil, which gives an even greater tone of intimacy with the Portuguese language’. Regardless of the explanation, prior research has obtained similar fndings, where speakers who are rated lower on both pronunciation profciency measures (accentedness, comprehensibility, fuency) and status and solidarity traits (e.g. honesty, education) also receive higher professional-related preference ratings from listeners (Trofmovich and Turuševa 2020).

A noteworthy exception to this pattern was when both prestige and performance level were low. In these scenarios, listeners shifted their preference toward treatment by L1 speakers, which was likely driven by the greater impact that job prestige had on the treatment preference ratings assigned to L1 over L2 speakers when low-level performance was demonstrated. Again, this is opposite to what is reported in Teló et al. (2022), where the sole circumstance favoring treatment by L2 speakers was low-prestige, low-performance scenarios. Nonetheless, our listeners’ behavior seems to be in line with a robust body of evidence showing not only people’s strong preference for highly skilled immigrants over low-skilled immigrants but also opposition to low-skilled immigration in general (e.g. Hainmuller and Hiscox 2010).

Lastly, additional fndings further expand our understanding of the effect of job prestige on listeners’ treatment preference. The ratings for treatment preference indicated a general preference for interaction styles associated with low-prestige jobs, irrespective of speakers’ L1 or performance. While identifying the precise mechanisms underlying this interaction is out of the scope of the present research, it is possible that listeners simply prefer the lower degree of formality and the higher levels of approachability likely conveyed by the speakers in those roles (e.g. Fast and Funder 2008). Similarly, listeners may feel a reduced social distance with speakers who employ interaction and/or speech styles prevalent in less formal, low-prestige jobs, fostering a sense of ease and openness in communication (Heylighen and Dewaele 2002; Fast and Funder 2008). More broadly, this could also be related to cultural differences in how people in Brazil and Canada consider job status/prestige and react to L2 speech.

# Comprehensibility

The results from the comprehensibility model offer valuable insights into how different factors infuence listeners’ perception of ease of understanding. The most notable and consistent effect observed in the comprehensibility ratings is the infuence of accentedness, where speakers who received lower accentedness evaluations were generally perceived as more comprehensible than those who received higher accentedness ratings. This aligns with both the initial study’s fndings and a well-established body of research (Derwing and Munro 2015). The effect of speaker L1 on comprehensibility, although not statistically signifcant, was qualifed by an interaction with accentedness, signaling that the difference in comprehensibility ratings between BP and Spanish speakers widened as the speaker’s accent became stronger.

The interplay between speaker L1 and comprehensibility takes on greater nuance in conjunction with prestige. The interaction between speaker L1 and prestige implies that the relationship between comprehensibility and job prestige is different for L1 BP and Spanish speakers, where basically the same L1 Spanish speakers were judged more comprehensible in low- versus high-prestige jobs, while L1 BP speakers were rated more comprehensible in high-prestige scenarios than in low-prestige scenarios. Hearing L1 Spanish speakers in low-prestige occupations and L1 BP speakers in high-prestige roles likely tapped into expectations held by the listeners, such that L2-accented speakers are more ftting for low-prestige occupations (e.g., Kalin and Rayko 1978). Importantly, for L2 speakers, comprehensibility ratings generally followed competence ratings, with L1 Spanish speakers being rated as more comprehensible and more competent in low- versus high-prestige scenarios. Regardless of the explanation, listeners appeared to confate pronunciation with professional competence for L2 speakers but did so to a lesser degree when assessing L1 speakers (Hosoda et al. 2007; Dragojevic and Giles 2016). Finally, differently from the initial study, speakers’ demonstrated performance level did not seem to interact with the comprehensibility ratings in a meaningful way, suggesting a less complicated picture for comprehensibility.

# Listener variables as predictors of speaker ratings

Considering prior research indicating the potential infuence of various listener-related factors on L2 speech assessment, we expanded the individual differences analysis reported in the initial study. We modeled four control covariates: the number of languages known by the listeners, their familiarity with L2-accented speech, their familiarity with the context in each script, and their ethnic pride. Despite a noteworthy difference between the listener samples in Teló et al. (2022) and here, particularly with all listeners in the current replication being L1 BP speakers as opposed to $7 3 \%$ of L1 English-speaking listeners in the initial study, the number of languages known by the listeners and their familiarity with L2-accented speech did not interact with listeners’ ratings, as in Teló et al. (2022). Context familiarity featured as a signifcant predictor of listeners’ ratings of competence, treatment preference, and comprehensibility $( p = . 0 5 1 )$ , where greater context familiarity was consistently related to higher ratings (Gass and Varonis 1984). This is an important fnding of the present study, and we encourage more research to understand the mechanisms of this interaction, which could be, for example, rooted in empathy (familiarity with the context might foster a sense of empathy and connection between the listener and the speaker), expectation alignment (listeners who are familiar with the context might have aligned expectations with the speaker’s communication style, leading to a more positive reception of the speaker and their message), or cognitive ease (familiarity with the context may reduce cognitive load for listeners). Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that the question aiming to elicit listeners’ context familiarity could be interpreted in slightly different ways (e.g. the listener could or not consider speaker-related information, such as their gender and L1, in determining how familiar they are with that specifc context). Despite the robust effect that the variable demonstrated in our models, some caution is necessary when generalizing this fnding. Finally, ethnic pride did not seem to be related to the ratings meaningfully.

# Limitations, implications, and future work

As a close replication, this study shares limitations with the original study, such as the fact that a detailed account of accent bias in any context would require systematic comparisons of representative samples of diverse listener groups. In addition, listeners did not have access to speakers’ visual cues. While our study extends the original investigation to novel ethnolinguistic backgrounds, our fndings are specifc to the linguistic pairing of Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese, which exhibit a high degree of similarity. As discussed above, our results suggest that processing L1- and L2-accented speech was similarly easy for the listeners. While this provides novel insights into the phenomenon of accent bias by reporting on evaluations provided to L2-accented speakers whose L2 pronunciation was generally not linked to lower comprehensibility, the cultural closeness between L1 BP and L1 Spanish speakers should also be considered, which is likely not the same for L1 English speakers from Canada and L1 Tagalog speakers from the Philippines. Relatedly, while there may be a power imbalance between L1 BP and L1 Spanish speakers in Brazil, the global context does not reinforce this imbalance to the same degree as it does to the power differential between L1 English and L1 Tagalog speakers in Canada. We encourage researchers to investigate linguistic and cultural pairings with varying degrees of proximity and power dynamics in future research. Additionally, it is essential to acknowledge that our results may not refect the evaluations of other immigrant groups in Brazil, such as Haitians, who face a greater likelihood of eliciting negative perceptions in comparison to other groups like Latinxs or Europeans (Mundin and Santos 2022). Similarly, given the sociopolitical and sociolinguistic landscapes of Santa Catarina, listeners from other states may hold different views toward the speakers. We also encourage researchers to adapt the methodological design for qualitative studies given that ratings provide only general patterns, which we might not be able to interpret accurately. To inspire future research, we provide a summary of the comments provided by the listeners as they evaluated the audio recordings (see Supplementary Data and Information). These data could help, among other things, to identify listener variables that deserve more attention in accent bias research. Furthermore, because voice features that were not controlled for may have infuenced listeners’ evaluations, especially of the professional and experiential constructs, further research is needed to disentangle the relative contributions of accent- and other pronunciation-related features (e.g. voice quality, speaking style) to listener evaluations. Lastly, our study used scripts that featured qualitative changes (see Method section) compared to the scripts used in Teló et al. (2022), potentially contributing to the obtained results.

Despite their overall promising outlook, our results point to the presence of accent bias in listeners’ assessments. This emphasizes the need for dismantling unjustifed associations between a person’s accent and their qualifcations, as well as long-standing notions that certain forms of self-expression and communicative practices are more or less compatible with an organization’s dominant culture (Park 2020). Achieving these societal goals requires critical education. The fnding that listeners’ context familiarity was positively related to their ratings also holds implications: If listener familiarity with speakers in certain roles matters, listener interventions aimed at reducing accent bias in professional settings should expose listeners to more examples of L2 speakers in high-performance, high-prestige contexts to set the expectation that they will encounter such speakers in these situations in the future. Similarly, more representation of L2 speakers in high-performance, high-prestige contexts in popular media should be advocated for (Eagly and Koenig 2021). In summary, addressing accent bias and promoting fair evaluations in professional communication environments requires a collective effort that encompasses education and the reevaluation of preconceived notions about language and language users.
