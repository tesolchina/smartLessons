Topic

This study examined the effects of second language (L2) proficiency, acquisition context, and topic on the use of verb argument constructions (VACs) in Asian college-level L2 writers' argumentative essays. A total of 776 essays written on two topics by 388 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and English as a Second Language (ESL) writers of two L2 proficiency levels were used as data. Six indices informed by large-scale corpora of L1 English speakers were used to gauge the frequency and association strength of the VACs. Results of a series of linear mixedeffects models showed the frequencies of verbs and verb-construction combinations were affected by the interaction between L2 proficiency and acquisition context. L2 proficiency also had a main effect on construction frequency, with more proficient writers using constructions of lower frequency than less proficient writers. No effect of L2 proficiency was found on the association strength of VACs. Additionally, acquisition context affected the directional association strength of VACs, with ESL writers using verbs that associated less strongly with constructions than EFL writers. Finally, topic effects were found on five of the six indices. These findings offered empirical evidence for the developmental trajectories of VACs, and carried practical implications for L2 writing pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

Usage-based linguistics posits that language consists of constructions, or conventionalized form-meaning pairings, which range from morphemes, words, phraseological units, to maximally abstract syntactic frames. One type of construction that is of particular importance is verb argument constructions (VAcs), which are composed of averb slot and the arguments it takes (e.g., the ditransitive construction nsubj $\scriptstyle \mathrm { \nabla \nabla \ n \ n ^ { \prime } }$ consists of a verb slot, which is the central element of the construction, a subject, two nouns or noun phrases which serve as indirect object and direct object respectively, such as in the sentence Isubjec $g a v e _ { \nu e r b }$ himindirectobject an applediret bject). Since VACs are "associated with the types of meanings that are often central to aspeaker's proposition (Casal et al., 2022), they are considered central building blocks of language. Aditionaly, VACs are important for second language (L2) writing, as indices measuring the quality of VAC usage (i.., the frequency of verbs, constructions, and verb-construction combinations, the diversity of constructions, the assciation strength of verb-construction combinations) were found to be predictive of L2 writing qualit (DeVore & Kyle, 2023; Kyle & Crossley, 2017; Park, 2017; Zhang & Lu, 2022). Since such indices gauge the size of the lerners repertoire of verbs, constructions, and verb-construction combinations, and measure the extent to which they can use verbs in appropriate lexicogrammatical contexts, they capture unique and important aspects of L2 writing quality, which cannot be captured by indices gauging overall lexical diversity and sophistication, or by indices measuring the absolute complexity of syntax (i., text-internal, formal syntactic features) such as mean length of clause and adverbial modifiers per clause, or by $n$ gram indices which measure the native-likeness of sequences of $n$ contiguous words.

So far, there has been quite some scholarly interest in the L2 acquisition of VACs (e.g., Elli & Ferreira-Junior, 2009, Kim & Hwang, 2022; Kyle et al., 2021), and a number of studies have examined how the L2 mastery of VACs as reflected in L2 written output dffered across proficiency levels (Kim & Rah, 2016; Park & Sung, 2024; Romer, 2019; Romer & Berger, 2019). These studies have offered important empirical evidence for the developmental trajectories of L2 VACs in terms of the schematicity of the verb slot and the repertoire of VAs. s attention, however, has ben paid to how the association strength between vers (e., oss) and unfilled VACs (e.g., 'nsubj $\mathrm { \Delta V n n ^ { \prime } } .$ ) varied across L2 proficiency levels. As argued by Wray (2002), L2 learners tend to focus on individual words rather than word combinations even when immersed in authentic input, which impedes their acquisition of word combinations. Empirical studies by Elli et al. (2008) on formulaic sequences also showed that it was frequency rather than association strength that predominantl determined the processbilit of English for adanced English as a Second Language (ESL) learners. Whether the acquisition of VACs of high asociation strength is also challenging for L2 learners remains an empirical question which deserves to be investigated, as answers to it can help enrich the understanding of the L2 acquisition of VACs.

Meanwhile, there are two other variables that have yet to receive enough aention in the study of L2 VAC acquisition and pro duction: one is acquisition context and the other is within-genre topic. In terms of acquisition context, it has been posited that the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context and the ESL context dffer significantly in terms of the type and amount of target language they can afford learners (Gilquin, 2016). Since \*input-driven inductive learning (Goldberg, 2006, p. 12) is one of the tenets of both usage-based approachto language aqusition and cognitie construction grammar, it fllows that there may exis differences in VAC usage by learners of the same proficiency level acros these two acquisition contexts. Meanwhile, acquisition context could also exert influence on the developmental trajectory of L2 VACs. It i likely that, by providing learners with more exposure to English, the ESL context can help them progres faster than their EFL counterparts. No systematic comparison, however, has been made on the VAC usage in EFL and ESL contexts, which hinders the understanding of the input effect on L2 VAC acquisition.

Finally, within-genre topic efect has been found in learners production of constructions such as words (Kim & Crossley, 2018; Zenker & Kyle, 2021), formulaic sequences (Li & Yao, 2023), and abstract syntactic frames such as noun modifiers (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Sarte & Gnesheva, 2022), finite and nonfinte subordination structures (Yang et al., 2015), etc. Such findings indicate that the specific linguistic features produced can be a function of not only L2 proficiency and acquisition context, but also topics. Though no study has yet investigated topic effect on VAC usage, such research endeavors should be made, as they may help establish the (non) existence of topic effect on the features of learners' VAC usage and inform L2 writing task design.

In light of the research gaps identified above, the present study examined the use of VACs in timed argumentative writing on two topics by college-level Asian EFL and ESL learners of two English proficiency levels i. intermediate and upper-intermediate to advanced). The study chose to focus on timed argumentative writing, as it is commonly featred in both college-level writing courses and large-scale standardized L2 tests. Findings of the study could help facilitate a fullr understanding of L2 VAC acqusition across intermediate and upper-intermediate-to-advanced proficiency levels, ascertain the role acquisition contexts play in L2 VAC usage and development, and reveal the potential effect of within-genre topics on L2 VAC usage.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Operationalization of VAC usage

Usage-based linguistics posits that language acquisition is statistical in nature, as \*rules" of language are "structural regularities that emerge from learners' implicit analysis of the distrbutional characterisics of the language input (Elis et al., 2016, p. 57). Frequency is thus a key driver of language learning, as it determines how likely it i for a learner to experience a construction. Meanwhile, contingency, or the probabilistic assciation between a cue and an outcome, is also an important factor in the learning process, as cue-outcome mapping of strong association strength is reliable and readily processed (Gries & Ellis, 2015).

In line with the usage-based approach to language acquisition, indices measuring the frequency of constructions, and th associ. ation strength between different components of constructions have been used to capture the statistical nature of the learning process and operationalize VAC usage (Zhang & Lu, 2022). Specificall, informed by some large-scale L1 corpora, which are used as proxies of learners' experience of the target language (Kyle & Crossey, 2017), a variety of VAC indices can be computed. Frequency indices are usually computed for the main verb lemma (e.g., give'), the unfilled VAC frame or construction (e.g., nsubj $\mathrm { ~ V ~ n ~ n ~ } ^ { \prime } )$ , and VAC frames with particular erb lemmas (e.g., nub gie n). As for asociation strength, two types of indices are calculated: bidirectiona indices which gauge the joint probability that a construction and a verb will occur (Gries et al., 2005), and directional indices which measure the conditional probability that a verb co-occurs with a particular construction and vice versa.

Importantly, while frequency indices tended to correlate negatively with L2 proficiency level (Romer, 2019) or rated writing quality (Kyle & Crossey, 2017; Kyle et al, 2021; Zhang & Lu, 2022), a positive relationship has been reported between association strength indices and writing quality (Kyle & Crossley, 2017; hang & Lu, 2022), indicating that leaners of higher proficiency tendedto have a larger repertoire of VACs and could use them in a more native-like fashion.

# 2.2. Effects of L2 proficiency on VAC usage

L2 proficiency has been found to have a substantial impact on VAC usage in learner writing. Firstly, several studies reported the expansion of VAC repertoire along L2 proficiency levels (Park, 2017; Park & Sung, 2024; Romer, 2019; Romer & Berger, 2019). Park (2017) also reported a linear increase in VAC type-token ratio cros the three proficiency levels examined. Scondy, whil leaners of low L2 proficiency mainly relied on formulaic sequences when using certain types of constructions, the constructions used by leaners of intermediate and advanced lels were of more astract types (Romer, 2019). Third, with the development of their L2 proficiency, learners were also found to use a more diverse range of verbs (Romer & Berger, 2019), les prototypical verbs (Kim & Rah, 2016), and more verbs of lower frequency (Romer, 2019). Taken together, these studies showed that L2 proficiency positively affected the development of the schematicity of the verb slot and the constructions, as wellas the diversity of the verbs and the VACs used. However, since all these studies focused on L1 Korean, German and Spanish learners of English, whether their findings could be generalized to learners of other L1 backgrounds remains an empirical question.

As for the relationship between L2 proficiency and (bi)directional association strength of verb-construction combinations, the few extant studies painted a lessclear picture. In a study of VAC usage by young EFL learners, Kim and Hwang (2022) found as beginner-level EFL learners receptive proficiency developed, they used verbs that asociated more strongly with six types of basic constructions. On the other hand, Romer and Berger (2019) found that only at advanced proficiency level i.., C1 in the Common European Framework of Reference) did EFL leaners use of verbs in the construction of nsubj V about n become more aligned with that of L1 English peakers. Besides reporting somewhat contradictory findings, these two studies had limited generalizability, as they only focused on a small number of constructions and only examined the directional asociation strength with construction as cue. As learners of intermediate and advanced L2 proficiency levels tend to have a larger repertoire of constructions at their disposal than beginner-level learners (Park & Sung, 2024; Romer, 2019; Romer & Berger, 2019), it seemed necessary to examine directional association strength with both verb and construction as cue as well as bidirectional association strength.

# 2.3. Effects of acquisition context on VAC usage

Usage-based approach to language acquisition posits that learners acquire constructions from the language input available and that the mental representations of constructions are "abstractions over one's cumulative experience with language (Bybee, 2008, p. 218) It thus follows that acquisition contexts that differ in the input provided to learners would afect the learning of constructions to a non-negligible extent In an EFL context, learners get exposed to English mainly in an educational stting through formal teaching of the language (Gilquin, 2016). Except for intenational communication, there i imited opportunity for exposure to English in a natural setting. By contrast, in an ESL context, English is not only taught in formal language classes but also used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. In addition, ESL leaners also have ample opportunities for exposure to English in a natural seting, especiall for institutional communication (Gilquin, 2016). Extant studies showed that ESL learners had better receptive knowledge of collocations than EFL learners (Yamashita & Jiang, 2010) and their use of bigrams and trigrams in argumentative writing was also more native-like than that of EFL leaners (Li & Yao, 2023). With regard to VAC usage, to the best of our knowledge, Gilquin's (2016) study, which focused on five periphrastic causative constructions (i.e., constructions made up of a causative verb controlling a non-finite complement: e.g., he would have us blieve') in novice academic EFL and ESL writing, was the only empirical study which compared VAC usage across these two acquisition contexts. The study found that the frequency of the causative constructions in the ESL writing was closer to that in the L1 English academic writing than that in the EFL writing. ESL writers used a smallr number of non-standard variants of causative constructions than EFL writers. Compared with EFL writers, ESL writers' choice of words for the non-finite verb slot also bore a closer resemblance to that displayed in L1 English academic writing. Gilquin's (2016) study lent support to the positive efect on learning brought by an acquisition context with more opportunities for exposure to the target language. Due to the small number of VACs examined, t couldnt, however, revel the ifferences in the overall VAC usage across EFL and ESL contexts. Additionall, since the study only examined L2 writer of a single proficiency level, how the developmental trajecories of VACs in the two acquisition contexts may align with or differ from each other remains unclear.

# 2.4. Potential topic effects on VAC usage

Though topic effects have been found in the production of a variety of constructions ranging from words, $n$ grams to syntactic structures such as complex nominals and subordination (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Kim & Crossey, 2018; Li & Yao, 2023; Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022; Yang et al., 2015; Zenker & Kyle, 2021), t the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has explored whether there exist topic effects on VAC usage. Extant studies reported that linguistic features of L2 writing could vary as a function of topics that differed in terms of their relevance (Hinkel, 2002) and familiarity to the writers (Abdi Tabari et al., 2021), the amount of causal reasoning involved (Yang et al., 2015), and their position along the personal-public spectrum (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Li & Yao, 2023). Of particular relevance to the present study are topics that vary along the personal-public spectrum. Atak and Saricaoglu (2021) found that compared to personal topics (e.g., one's preference for online learning or traditional learning), public or impersonal topics (e.g., the banning of death penalty) led to Turkish EFL writer's increased use of more complex grammatical structures. Li and Yao (2023) reported that a social' topic about banning smoking in restaurants elicited more native-like bigram and trigram use than a personal topic about doing part-time jobs in the writing by both college-level L1 English speakers and L2 leaners f English. Whether VAC usage also differs across these two types of topics is an empirical question worth investigating.

# 2.5. The present study

To sum up, the litrature reviewed above showed that much remains to be learned about the effect that L2 proficiency, acquisition context, and topic may have on VAC production. To address these research gaps, the present study examined the frequency and as. sociation strength of VACs in timed independent argumentative writing by college-level Asian EFL and ESL learners of two L2 pro ficiency levels on two topics that vary along the personal-public spectrum. The study was guided by the following research questions.

1. How does English proficiency affect VAC usage in L2 argumentative writing?   
2. How does acquisition context affect VAC usage in L2 argumentative writing?   
3. Are there diffrences in VAC usage in L2 argumentative writing across topics that vary along the personal-public spectrum?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Data

# 3.1.1. Essay selection

Essays used in the study were taken from the Written Essays Module (version 2.3) of the International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English (ICNALE, Ishikawa, 2013), which contained a total of 5376 timed argumentative essays on two topics by college-level EFL and ESL learners from ten Asian countries and regions. Based on thir scores in large-scale proficiency tests or a vocabulary size test, all writers were classified into four CEFR-linked proficiency levels: A2, B1_1, B1_2, and ${ \bf B } 2 +$ , which covered B2, 1, and C2 levels. I an attempt to provide ratins and err-tagging for some of thesays in the corpus, the devlopers of the ICNALE randomly selected 640 esas acrossall our proficiency leves from the Written Essays Modul to form the Edited Essays Module, and subsequently had thee essays rated and edited by five L1 English raters (Ishikawa, 2018). Each essay was scored by one rater using the ESL Composition Profile (Jacobs et al, 1981), an analytic rating scale composed of five sub-scales. In order to gain a clearer under. standing of the writing quality of the 640 essays, two experienced EFL rater each scored half f th essas using the ESL Compositin Profile. I cases where the average of the five sub-scores awarded by the EFL raters differed by one or more than one point from the original ratig given by the INAE raters, the first author of this study would r-rate the essay in question. The average of the two sets of sub-scores that were closest to each other were used as the final scores of the essays. The ICC (intraclas correlation cofficients) values of al five sub-scores awardd were al equal to or above 0.90. The five sub-scores of each essay were then added up to get atotal score and an ANOVA analysis was conducted on the total scores. The post-hoc analysis showed no significant ifference between the total scores of B1_1 writers $( M = 6 4 . 6 0 7$ $S D = 9 . 3 7 0 _ { \it \cdot } ^ { \prime }$ and B1_2 writers $( M = 6 8 . 2 0 1$ $S D = 1 2 . 7 8 3 $ (one-way ANOVA post-hoc analysis using the Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of 0.0125 per test is nonsignificant at $\pmb { p = 0 . 2 7 5 } \}$ . Since the essays in the Edited Essays Module could be viewed as reresentative of those in the Written Essays Module, we decided to merge B11 and B1 2 into single level of B1. In addition, as the ESL population at the A2 level was very small $\left( N = 2 1 \right)$ ), the study decided to focus on B1 and ${ \bf B } 2 +$ levels only, which accounted for approximately $8 2 ~ \%$ of the writers in the corpus. Since the total number of ESL essays at the $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ level was 194, we decided to sample 194 essays for each of the two proficiency levels and the two acquistion contexts s as t present a balanced picture of EFL and ESL writers at B1 and B2 + levels. Efforts were also made to balance the number of essays at the B1_1 $\left( N = 9 8 \right)$ ) and the B1_2 levels $( N = 9 6 )$ . Excluding several cases where there weren't sufficient essays, an equal or near-equal number of esays were randomly sampled from the four ESL and the six EFL countres/areas (see Appendix A in online supplementary materials for the specifics).

# 3.1.2. Differences in the exposure to English across EFL and ESL writers

According to Ishikawa (2018), of the ten countries and areas, four are ESL countries/areas (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republi of China, Pakistan, the Philipines, and Singapore), as English is used as one of the fficial languages there, and the other six are EFL countries/areas (China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, and Taiwan, China). The present study thus clasified writers from the ESL countries/areas as ESL learners, and those from the EFL countries/areas as EFL learners. To further ascertain that the EFL writers and the ESL writers diffred in terms of their exposure to English, writers responses to English-using/learning-related questionnaire items as collected by the ICNALE were compared. The results of independent-samples t tests showed that except for \*experiences of being taught by L1 Englis teachers" and "experiences of learning pronunciation, the ESL learners scored significantly higher than the EFL learners on al the other English-learning-related items, thus proving that the two cohorts of learners did differ in their exposure to English (see Appendix B-1 and B-2 in online supplementary materialsfor the descriptive statistics of the writers responses to the 13 questionnaire items, and the results of the independent-samples t tests.

Table 1 presents the descriptive satistics of all 776 essays, and the demographic information of all 388 writer can be found in Appendix A in online supplementary materials.

# 3.1.3. Essay topics

As shown in Table 1, all writers were required to write two essays. They were given 20 to $4 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ for each essay, or 40 to $8 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ for both. They were instructed to writ the two essays in one stig, using a word processor, but were not allowed to use ictionaries or reference tols. The two topics that the writers were required to write about were A It is important for ollegestudents to have part time job (shortened as PTJ in Table 1), and B) Smoking should be completely banned at ll the restaurants in the country (shortened as SMK in Table 2). Writers needed to show if they agreed or disagreed with the statements and provide reasons and specific details to support their opinions. Importantl, the PTJ and the SMK topic were described respectively as a"familiar, personal topic" and a"social topic by the developer of the ICNALE (Ishikawa, 2018,p. 127). Whil it was hard to gauge topic familiarity without empirical means such as surveys or questionnaires, the classfication of the PTJ topic as personal' and the SMK topic as social' seemed sound. It was likely that the writers, who wereall college students, would write about themselves or their personal experiences of doing part-time jobs when writing on the PTJ topic. Meanwhile, they probably would need to write about "groups and communities rather than themselves and/or their families/experiences' (Hamp-Lyons & Mathias, 1994, p. 55) when writing on the SMK topic. Since public topics have been found to elicit bettr linguistc performance than personal topic (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Li & Yao, 2023), it would be interesting to see whether the same pattern would hold for VAC usage as well.

# 3.2. Text analysis

All texts were checked for spelling and formatting errors before they were analyzed. The Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic ophistication and Complexit (TAAssc) version 1.1.9 (Kyle, 2016) was used to calculate the VAC indices for al 776 essays. TAAssC isanatural language processing (NLP) tool that provides computational indices inspired by usage-based theories of language learning. The tool uses the Stanford neural network dependency parser (Chen & Manning, 2014) for initial text processig. High-level accuracy (around $9 0 \%$ has been reported for both POS-tagging and dependency parsing for texts written by both L1 English writers and L2 learners (DeVore & Kyle, 2023).

TAAssC defines VACs as linguistic structures composed of a main verb and allits direct dependents. For example, in the sentence I have a sister', the main verb is 'have' and it takes two direct dependents $^ { \circ } T$ and $\cdot _ { a }$ sister', with $^ { \circ } T$ being the subject of the verb 'like' and 'a sister' being its object. TAAssC uses the Corpus of Contemporary American English (C0CA; Davies, 2009) as the reference corpus to generate the frequency profiles of main verb lemmas, constructions, and verb-construction combinations. For instance, the main verb lemma frequency of have in the wrtten section f C0cA is 30,182.42 (per million), the frequency of the simple transitive construction in COCA is 48,780.10 (per million), and the frequency of the verb-construction combination of have and the simple transitive con. struction in COCA magazine sub-corpus is 5335.93 (Kyle, 2016). Such frequency profile are then used to create a verb-construction contingency table for a specificverb-construction pair, in which the frequencies of the four different types of combinations of the verb and the construction (i.e., $^ +$ verb $^ +$ construction; $^ +$ verb -construction; -verb $^ +$ construction; -verb -construction) are calculated. Subsequently, these four types of frequencies are used to calculate (bi)directional association strength scores. In the present study, the entire written portion of COCA, which covers the sub-corpora of academic, fiction, magazine and news, was used as a proxy for college-level Asian learners' L2 experience.

# 3.3. Indices chosen

A total of seven indices based on cocA (all written) were selected to gauge the frequency, and bidirectional and directional association strength of the VACs in learner texts. They were log-transformed token-based frequency indices for main verb lemmas, constructions, and verb-construction combinations, type-based approximate collostructional strength and collostruction ratio, and type-based delta P with verb/construction as cue.

# 3.3.1. Frequency

TAAsSC provides token-based, type-based, and log-transformed token-based frequency indices for main verb lemmas, construtions, and verb-construction combinations. We opted to use the log-transformed token-based frequency indices, so s to account or all individual instances of the use of verb lemmas, constructions, and their combinations in learner writing, and to adjust for the potential Zipfian nature of the frequency data. The frequency indices were calculated based on the frequency counts of verb lemmas, constructions, and their combinations derived from cocA (all writte). Target structures (e.g., a construction) in a text which did not occur in the reference corpus were not counted toward the index score. Average frequency cores for the three types of tructures were then calculated for each text.

# 3.3.2. Bidirectional association strength

TAAssC provides token-based and typed-based indices of two kinds of bidirectional association strength: approximate collostructional strength and collostruction ratio. We opted to use the type-based indices, s they gauge the association strength of all the nique combinations of verb lemma and constructions in learner texts.

Approximate colostructional strength measures the joint probability that a verb and a construction wil co-occur (Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2003). For instance, the approximate collostructional strength is 149,377.22 for the combination of have' and simple transitive construction, indicating a high joint probabilit of their co-ocurrence. If a verb is matched with the wrong construction (e. 8, These hinder with the ambience of the restaurant.), however, it receives a score of zro, as no such combination can be found in the reference corpora. ased n the aproximate collostructional trength values f al unique erb-construction pairs in text, the average type-based approximate collostructional strength was then calculated for each text.

Collostruction ratio, a large-grained index, gauges the ratio of attracted verb-construction combinations i.e, verb-construction combinations that are more frequent than the random co-occurrences of their components) to repelld verb-construction combinations (i.e, verb-construction combinations that are les frequent than the random co-occurrences of their components in a text) (Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2003). The higher the ratio, the more strongly associated the verb-construction combinations in a text are.

# 3.3.3. Directional association strength

To capture the non-reciprocal nature of verb-construction combinations (Ellis & Ferrira-Junior, 2009), indices of directional association strength were also used. TAAssc provides token-based and type-based delta P and faith scores as measures of direc. tionality. Delta P (Ellis & Ferrera-Junior, 2009) calculates the probability of an outcome (e.g, aconstruction) given a cue (e.g, a particular verb) minus the probabilit of he outcome without the cue eg., with any other verb). For example, the delta P value for the outcome of the simple transitive construction given the cue have' is 0.124, indicating there is a higher probabilit of the outcome construction given the cue have' than a cue of another word. Faith, on the other hand, calculates only the percentage of the total instances of the cue (e.g, a particular verb or a construction) that occurs in the verb-construction combination. Since faith doesn't consider all possile contingencies (see DeVore & Kyle, 2023 for a detailed explanation of the calculation ofdelta P and faith) and is "extremely instable and sensitive' (Gries et al., 2005, p.662), we opted to use type-based delta P indies, which were calculated with verb as cue and construction as outcome, and vice versa. Average type-based delta P indices were then calculated for each text.

# 3.3.4. Checking for multicollinearity

In order to examine how these seven indices correlated with each other, a corrlation analysis was conducted. ince some of the indices did not satisfy the requirement of normal distribution, Spearman's rank-order corrlation was run. As shown in Table 2, there existed a strong correlation between type-based average approximatecollostructional strength and type-based average delta P with construction as cue $( r h o = 0 . 7 0 4$ $p < 0 . 0 1 $ ). Since average approximate collostructional strength had a large kurtosis (39.064) and a large number of outliers, we decided to exclude this index from subsequent analyses. No other corlation coeficients exceeded 0.7, though the correlations between average verb-constructio frequency and average verb frequency and average construction frequency both exceeded 0 $. 6 ( p < 0 . 0 1 )$ , indicating that verb-construction frequency may be attributable to the frequency of both the verb and the construction used. To paint a fullpicture of the use of VACs, the average frequency of verbs, constructions, and verb-construction combinations were all examined in the study.

# 3.4. Statistical analysis

To examine the efect of L2 proficiency, acquisition context, and topic on VAC production, Linear Mixed-efects Models (LMMs) were used. LMMs were warrnted because data were collcted according to repeated measures design. In addition, LMMs can produce more accurate reresoncofficients of the fixed effts than VA, as LMs releate the idioynrasies of speciic writers, topcs, etc., to the variance captured by the random efects (Grie, 2015). In the present study, a series of LMMs were developed using the R (Version 4.1.2, R Core Team, 2021) package me4 (Version 1.1-26; Bates e al., 2015), with the VAC indices as the dependent variable, and L2 proficiency (B1 and $B 2 + )$ , acquisition context (EFL and ESL), topic (PTJ and SMK) and their interactions as fixed effects. All two-level factors were contrast coded (e.g., EFL: $- 0 . 5$ and ESL: 0.5 and centered at 0), so that the intercept of the fixed effects concerned in each model represents the grand mean rather than the baseline condition, which allows the direct interpretation of their cofficients as main effct. For crossed random effects, random intercepts for writers were pecified in all models, as the writers English proficiency lels ranged from intermediate to advanced. Initiall, a by-writer random slope for topic was also included in the random efect structure; however, it was later dropped as the model faled toconverge. Model section was done using a backward heuristic approach, in which the most saturated model was compared with les complex models, and the more complex model would be rejected if it was found to fit the data no better than the les complex ones. Since the models were nested (i., the simpler model appeared in the more complex model), the best fitting models were selected in a pairwise fashion using Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) derived from the anova function in Base $\mathbb { R } ,$ and $p$ -values were Bonferroni adjusted based on the number of comparisons made. The R package lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2015) was used to estimate $p$ values with the default Satterthwaite method. The marginal $R ^ { 2 }$ values $( R ^ { 2 } { \mathrm { m } } )$ , which indicate the amount of variance explained by only the fixed effects, and the conditional $R ^ { 2 }$ values $( R ^ { 2 } { \mathrm { c } } )$ , which indicate the amount of variance explained by the fixed effects and the random effects, were estimated using the $\mathbf { R }$ package MuMIn (Barton, 2013). In case interaction effcts were found, simple effects analysis was performed through comparing estimated marginal means using the emmeans package in R (Lenth, 2022).

# 4. Results

The descriptive statistics of the six VAC indices in the essays on the PTJ topic and the SMK topic by EFL and ESL writer at B1 and $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ levels are presented in Table 3.

Table 4 presents the results of the ix best-fitig LMMs. Al reported models satisied the assumptions of linearity, homogeneit of variance and the normality of the distribution of residuals. Interaction efects were found between L2 proficiency and acquisition context in the models of verb frequency (estimate $= - 0 . 0 7 4$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 4 6 ^ { \cdot } } \end{array}$ ) and verb-construction frequency (estimate $= - 0 . 1 1 1$ 3 $p =$ 0.046) Simple efect analyses weretherefore conducted in order to reveal the deretowhich one factor i differentillyeffective at each level of asecond factor. Table 5 shows that EFL leaners of B1 level scored significantly higher on the average frequency of verb lemmas than ESL learners of both B1 (EFL B1- ESL B1: estimate) $= 0 . 0 7 9$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 6 \mathrm { \AA } } \end{array}$ and $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ levels (EFL B1- ESL B2 +: estimate $=$ 0.211, $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ . EFL learners of $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ level also scored significantly higher on this index than ESL learners of the same level (EFL $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ - ESL $\mathbf { B } 2 + \mathbf { \delta }$ estimate $= 0 . 1 5 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ I, but their scores on this index were similar to those of ESL learners of B1 level (ESL B1 - EFL $\mathsf { B 2 + : }$ estimate $= - 0 . 0 2 2$ $p = 1 . 0 0 0 \AA$ . While the average frequency of verb lemmas decreased significantly from ESL B1 to ${ \bf B } 2 +$ level (ESL B1 - ESL B2 $^ +$ : estimate $= 0 . 1 3 2$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ , no significant differences were found across EFL B1 and B2 + level (EFL B1 - EFL B2 $+ \colon$ estimate $= 0 . 0 5 8$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 9 6 \mathrm { \ } } \end{array}$ . Fig. 1 visualizes the two-way interaction. A similar pattern was found in the interaction between L2 proficiency and acquisition context in the model of verb-construction frequency (se Fig. 2 for the visualization of the interaction), except that no significant difference was found between EFL B1 and ESL B1 writers (EFL B1- ESL B1: estimate $= 0 . 0 2 7$ $p = 1 . 0 0 0 )$ . In other words, although EFL B1 writers were similar to their ESL counterparts in terms of the frequency of verb-construction used significant difference existed in this index between EFL and ESL writers at $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ levels (EFL B2 + - ESL B2 $^ +$ : estimate $= 0 . 1 3 8$ $p =$ 0.004).

Besides these interaction effects, L2 proficiency main effect was found in the final model of construction frequency (estimate $=$ 0.103, $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ I, and the main effect of acquisition context was found in the final model of type-based delta P with construction as cue (estimate $= - 0 . 0 0 6$ A $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ). Topic main effect was found in the final models of verb frequency (estimate $= - 0 . 3 1 1 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ construction frequency (estimate $= - 0 . 0 9 0$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ , verb-construction frequency (estimate $= - 0 . 1 3 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ , type-based collostruction ratio (estimate $= 1 . 4 5 5$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ , and type-based delta P with verb as cue (estimate $= 0 . 0 0 4$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$

To sum up, L2 proficiency main effect was found on average construction frequency, with ${ \bf B } 2 +$ -level learners using less frequent constructions than B1-level learners. Acquisition context main efect was found on average delta P with construction as cue, with ESL learners using verbs that associated les strongly with the constructions than EFL learners. Meanwhile, interaction effects between L2 proficiency and acqusition context were found on average verb frequency and verb-construction frequency. While EFL learners of ${ \bf B } 2 +$ level did not differ significantly from EFL B1 learners in either of these two indices, ESL learners of $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ level were found to use significantly less frequent verbs and verb-construction combinations than both EFL learners of $\mathbf { B } 2 + \mathrm { l e v e l }$ , as well as ESL and EFL B1- level learners. Finally, topic main efect was observed on five indices, with the sMK topic elciting verbs, constructions, and verbconstruction combinations of lower average frequencies, and higher collostruction ratio and delta P value (verb as cue).

# 5. Discussion

The present study examined how L2 proficiency, acquisition context, and topics that vary along the personal-public spectrum affected VAC usage in 776 argumentative essays by Asian college-level L2 learners of English. The analyses yielded some important findings.

First, it was found that the interaction between L2 proficiency and acquisition context affected the average verb lemma frequency and the average verb-construction frequency. Although EFL learners of B2 + level used les frequent verbs and verb-construction combinations than their B1-level counterparts, the differences in the two indices between the two proficiency levels in the EFL context were both insignificant, indicating that even EFL learners of upper-intermediate-to-advanced L2 proficiency level may have difficult acquring verbs and verb-construction combinations of lower frequency. Considering the ignificant diffrences found in the two indices between ESL learners of different L2 proficiency levels, and between EFL and ESL learners of $\mathbf { B } 2 + \mathrm { l e v e l } .$ it seemed reasonable to list the lack of exposure to authentic target language in the EFL context as one important reason for the underdevel. opment of verbs and verb-construction combinations among EFL learners. As posited by usage-based linguistics, les frequently encountered constructions are more difficult to acquire than those that are encountere frequently (Ellis & Ferrira-Junio, 2009) With limited exposure to English in their acquisition context, EFL learners may not experience certain verbs and verb-construction combinations frequently enough for them to become part of their productive language repertoire. For instance, low-frequency verbs such as constitute (C0CA all writte frequency rank: 2553), designate (C0CA all written frequency rank: 4605), and juggle (COCA all writen frequency rank: 8499), which were used in the ESL B2 + writing for a total of 17, 13, and 12 times respectively, were not used in the F writing at all eanwhile, aclose lok at the us of the 15 most frequently used verbs in COCA (allwitten) showed that while there was a decrease f 355 tokens from ESL B1 (3102 tokens) to ESL B2 + (2747 tokens), the diffrence between EFL B1 (3466 tokens) and EFL $\mathbf { B } 2 + ( 3 3 6 6$ tokens) was less pronounced (i.e., 100 tokens). The small differences in EFL writers' use of some high-frequency vers (e.g., do, say,g,get, know, think, want) across proficiency levels could also have ben the result of their lack of command of lessfrequent verb and verb-construction combinations (see Appendix C in online supplementary materials for the specifics).

Second, with regard to construction frequency, an L2 proficiency main effect was found, with ${ \bf B } 2 +$ -level learners using constructions of lower frequency than their B1-level counterparts. For instance, B1-level learners used the simple transitive (nsu) $ { \mathrm { ~  ~ V ~ n ~ } } _ { \mathrm { ~ \it ~ \it ~ \ / ~ e ~ } }$ , a high-frequency construction, roughly $2 0 \%$ more frequently than their $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ -level counterparts (B1-level: 2603 times, $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ -level: 2075 times). Meanwhile, they used lower-frequency constructions such as phrasal verb (V n prt' and $\mathbf { \tilde { V } } [ \mathbf { p r t } \mathbf { n } ^ { \prime } )$ , and passive (nsubjpass V') less frequently than $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ -level learners (phrasal verb: 82 times by B1-level and 168 times by ${ \bf B } 2 +$ -level; passive: 509 times by B1- level and 615 times by $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ -level). Since a strong negative correlation was found between construction frequency and construction type-token ratio $( r = - 0 . 7 1 5 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , it followed that the $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ -level learners also used a greater variety of constructions than B1- level learners. This finding aligned with extant studies on the expansion of construction types in the writing by EFL learners across different proficiency levels (Park, 2017; Park & Sung, 2024; Romer, 2019; Romer & Berger, 2019).

On the other hand, the lack of a significant effect of acquisition context on construction frequency suggested that EFL and ESL learners of intermediate and upper-intermediate-to-advanced proficiency levels followed a similar developmental trajectory in their acquisition of constructions. As argued by Wray (2002), compared with first language leaners, post-childhood L2 learners may be in possession of more mature, and more analytical cogntive abilitie. As a result, when encountering VACs, they are inclined o focus on the words and \*how they can be glued together (Wray, 2002, p. 206). The tendency to build VACs up from words may help direct L2 learners' attention to the astract schematic knowledge of constructions. For instance, upon encountering a specific VAC such as The company has provided me with a car, L2 learners may be able to extract the construction 'nsubj V n with n' without much trouble. Additionall, compared with the idiosyncrasies of the ways individual verbs are used, a certain construction (e.g., nsubj V n with n), which is exemplified by quite a few types, may be experienced as a regular' pattern, and can thus be more easily processed (MacWhinney, 2001). Hence, despite not having as much input in their acquisition context as ESL learners, EFL learners may not be at a distinct disadvantage in comparison to their ESL counterparts in the acquisition of constructions.

Third, L2 proficiency was found to have no significant effct on any of the three type-based association strength indices. The acquisition of VACs of trong association strength has bee found challenging for beginner-level L2 learners. While Kim and Hwang (2022) found recetive proficiency facilitate sixth-grade L1 Korean leaner's acquisition of verbs which associat strongly wit six asic type f constructions (i.., transitive, inransitie transitive/inransitive, inansitive mtion, ative, and ditansitive), the acquisition of VACs of strong association by beginner-level learners was found to be neither positively affected by the time spent learning English (Kyle et al., 2021), nor by their increased exposure to English (Kim & Ro, 2023). As for learners of higher L2 proficiency, Romer and Berger's (2019) study showed that the acquisition of VACs of strong contingency was a challenge to, since the native-like command of verb-construction association (in the construction of nsubj V about n) was only atainable by learners of C1 level. The lack of changes in the association strength across B1- and $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ -level learners found in the present study offered further empirical evidence to the ifficulty that EFL and ESL leaners of intermediate and upper-intermediat-to-advanced levels in acquiring VACs of high contingency. One possible reason for this diffculty may gain lie in adult  leaners adoption of an analytical approach towards the processing of VACs, which draw their attention to the abstract schematic knowledge of the unfilled constructions (e.g., nsubj V n with n'), rather than to the verb-construction combination as a whole (e.g., nsubj provide n with n'). As a result, they sometimes match verbs with the wrong constructions (e.g., \*..art-time job can provide us the opportunity to make money.), which esults i such ombinations receiving (bidirectional association strenh scores of zeo, as they do not appear in the reference corus. Meanwhile, with the expansion of their repertoires of verbs and constructions, learners could integrate a larger variety of verbs with the appropriate constructions, some of which may not co-occur very frequently. For instance, compared with highfrequency words such as suggest', words like recommend' have lower directional association strength scores when used in the 'nsubj V ccomp' con. struction (e.g.,'recommend that..) type-ased delta P ith verb as cue for suggest and 'recommend' are 0.105 and 0.024 respectively; while type-based delta P with construction as cue for them are 0.010 and 0.001 respectively.

While no L2 proficiency main effect was found on associationstrength indices, an acquisition context main effect was detected on the directional association strength index of delta P with construction as cue, with the ESL learners scoring lower on this index than their EFL counterparts. The present study found that the ESL leaners used lessfrequent verbs than the EFL learners. As there existed a moderate negative correlation between verb lemma frequency and verb lemma type-token ratio $( r = - 0 . 6 2 2$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ , it followed that the ESL learners also tended to use a wider range of verbs than the EFL learners. Since it has been found that the use of diverse types of verbs by adult L2 learner could reduce the verb-construction association strength (Ellis & Ferreira-Junior, 2009; Kim & Rah, 2016), the ESL learners tendency to use a larger variety of verbs could lead to  decrease in the association strength of the As used. Meanwhile, as discussed above, the acquisition of VACs of strong association strength was challenging to ESL leaners as well A close look at the ESL writing showed there were instances where some lower-frequency verbs were mismatched with certain constructions. For instance, some ESL writers used 'expose', prohibit, and devote in the verb slot of 'nsubj V to $\mathbf { n } ^ { \prime }$ , nsubj V n inf', and 'nsubj V in n' respectively when they should be used in the verb slot of nsubj V n prep'. There were also cases where a transitive verb such as accommdate and hinder wa ued intransitively (e.,.eulations should be mde toaccommodate to the majorit.." hinder with the mbience of the restaurant"). Thus it could be posited that the use of esfrequent verbs coupled with the dificulties in acquring VACs of strong contingency led to the ESL learners' scoring lower on delta P with construction as cue than the EFL learners.

Finally, the study found a main effect of topic on five of the sixAC indces. l thr frequency indices were inificantly lower on the SMK topic than on the PTJ topic, while both colostruction rato, a larg-grained bidirectional asociation strength index, and delta P with verb as cue, a directional association strength index, were significantly higher on the SMK topic than on the PTJ topic (see Table 4). These findings indicated that when writing on the SMK topic, L2 writers used les frequent verbs, constructions and verbconstruction combinations, a higher proportion of VACs with stronger probability of co-occurrence than that of the random co. occurrence of their components, and constructions which have a higher probabilit of being the outcome given certain verbs as the cue. It was also found that despite being slightly shorter than the writing on the PTJ topic (ee Table 1), the writing on the SMK topic contained more unique types of verb lemmas, and that this difference existed in the writing by both B1- and $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ -level EFL and ESL learners, albeit to different extents (i.e., EFL B1: 340 types on the PTJ topic vs. 378 types on the SMK topic; EFL $\mathbf { B } 2 \mathrel { + } \mathrel { \mathrm { : } } 3 7 5$ types on the PTJ topic vs. 396 types on the SMK topic; ESL B1: 403 types on the PTJ topic vs. 427 types on the SMK topic; ESL $8 2 + : 5 0 6$ types on the PTJ topic vs. 546 types on the SMK topic). Taken together, these findings indicated that the SMK topic led to more complex and native. like use fVAs thanthe  topic, thus offering mpirical evidence thatVA usage iffered across topics that vary along the personal. public spectrum. One possble reason for the observed topic efect may be that compared with personal topics, public topics are more cognitively complex (Hamp-Lyons & Mathias, 1994). As cognitive complexity and structural complexity in production run parallel (Robinson & Gilabert, 2007), public topics could lead to higher levels f lingustic complexity than personal topics. t should be pointed out, however, this interpretation should be viewed with the most caution, since the differences in the cognitie complexit of the two topics were not established empirically.

# 6. Conclusion

By examining the VAC usage in 776 argumentative writing on two topics by EFL and ESL learners of two proficiency levels, the study explored the efect L2 proficiency, acquisition context and topic had on VAC usage. The findings showed that the interaction between 2 proficiency and acquisition context had a significant effec on the frequency of verbs and verb-construction combinations. Specifically, EFL B1- and $\mathsf { B 2 + }$ -level learners lagged behind their ESL counterparts in the command of lower-frequency verbs, and EFL $^ { \mathrm { B 2 + } }$ -evel learners lagged behind their ESL counterparts in the use of lower-frequency verb-construction combinations. While there was no significant decrease in the frequency of either verbs or verb-construction combinations acros the proficiency levels in the EFL context, the opposite was found in the ESL context. L2 proficiency main effect was also found on the frequency of constructions, with the more proficient learners using constructions of lower frequency than those of lower proficiency level. No L2 proficiency effect however, was found on either the bidirectional or the directional association strength of VACs. Meanwhile, acquisition context had a main effect on the directional ssociation strength index wth construction as cue, and the EL leaners scored lower on this index than their EFL counterparts. Final, topic main effect was found onfive of the six indices examined. Compared to the PTJ topic, the SMK topic led to the use of erbs, constructions, and verb-construction combination of lower frequencie, and VACs of stronger bidirectional and directional association strength (with verb as cue).

The findings of the study carried important theoretical and pedagogical implications. Theoreticall, firs, the differences in the frequency of the verbs used by B1- and ${ \bf B } 2 +$ -level learners across the EFL and the ESL context, the differences in the frequency of the verb-construction used by the $\mathbf { B } 2 +$ -level learners across the acquisition contexts, and the different developmental trajectories of verbs and verb-construction combinations across the two acquisition contexts ffered empirical evidence for the important role input played in the acquisition of VACs, which lent support to the usage-based theory of language learning. Second, the similarity in the devel. opmental tajectories of constructions across the two acquisition contexts suggested that for learners of intermediate and upperintermediate-to-advanced levels, the acquisition of constructions was les afected by the input learners were exposed to than that of verbs and verb-construction combinations. It was possble that with their analytcal aproach towards the processing of VACs, and with their perceiving constructions as being more regular' than individual verbs and verb-construction combinations, adult L2 learners could be adept at acquiring the abstract schematic knowledge of constructions, whatever acquisition context they were in. Third, the finding that both the FL and the ESL learners had difficulty acquiring VACs of strong association strength suggested that L2 learners of intermediate and upper-intermediate-to-advanced levels may not be attuned to VACs as packaged wholes, which may lead to the production of mismatched verbs and constructions. Additionall, their expanded repertoires of verbs and constructions could also lead tothe us of verbs and constructions that donot cooccur frequenly. Finally, the topic ffet found indicated that the specific VAC usage features oserved were not only a function of learner-related variables such as L2 proficiency and acquisition context, but a function of the specific topic that was written on.

Pedagogically, first explicit instruction and input enhancement should be offered in EFL classrooms to compensate for the lack of natural input i this acquisition context. Teachers can try data-driven learning, acorus-based teaching approach, where students are exposed to multiple examples of the target verbs or verb-construction combinations in their natural context Diferent forms of input nhancement can be used to highlight the targeted constructions visually to helpstudents notice" them. These pedagogical practices should be accompanied by exercises which can help students put the newly learned verbs and verb-construction combinations in practice. For instance students can be asked to replace a more generic and high-frequency verb with a more specific verb of lowerfrequency. Second, explicit instructions on the patterns of verb-construction co-occurrence should be offered in ESL classroom so as to help learners recalibrate some of their nowledge of the specific semantic and syntactic constraints imposed by certain constructions and verbs, and use VACs in a more native-lik fashion. For instance,students could practice corrcting non-standard verb-construction combinations extracted from their own writings. Finall, the topic efect observed showed that for college-level L2 learners, public topics elicited higher-quality VAC production than personal topics. Hence when designing writing tass for college-level learners, L2 teachers may consider using public topics. Test-developers should bear in mind that VAC production could be a function of the specific topics written on. Thus, should a choice of topics be ffered to test-takers, test-developers need to ensure that topic of a similar type are provided (e.g., public topics), so that no test-takers will be disadvantaged by the topics they choose to write on.

The study suffered several limitations, which should be addressed in future studies. First, ince only two topics were used in the study, there may exist a confounding effct of subject matter on the relationship between topics that vary along the personal-public spectrum and VAC usage. Future studies could use multiple topics so as to rule out the potential confounding effect of subject mat ter. Second, the study did not delve into the underlying reasons of the observed topic efect. Writing-processoriented studie should be conducted to find out if the hypothesized ifferences i cognitive load across public and personal topics do exist Third, as there exist genre-specific VAC features (Casal et al. 2022), the findings of the present study, which only examined VAC usage in argumentative writing, may not be generalized to other genres. Fourth, due to the lack of ESL samples at A2 level, the study did not examine the VAC production of beginner-level L2 writers. Future studies should try to use samples that cover a fullr range of L2 proficiency lels.
