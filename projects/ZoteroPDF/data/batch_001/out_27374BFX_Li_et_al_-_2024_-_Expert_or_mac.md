# ABSTRACT

For student teachers’ professional development, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) represents both opportunity and challenge. This exploratory quasi-experimental study aims to investigate the effects of “Human-Human” and “Human-Machine” collaborative learning approaches on the SETM teaching training performance of student teachers. Twenty-three student teachers were divided into two groups within a single class, each adopting one learning method. The experiment lasted for two months with weekly three-hour sessions. Data were analysed focusing on critical thinking, learning performance, and cognitive load between the groups. The results indicated that student teachers using ChatGPT showed higher critical thinking systematicity, task completion efficiency, and experienced lower cognitive load. Student teachers paired with in-service teachers slightly outperformed those with ChatGPT on the final teaching design proposal. These findings underscore the potential and varying strengths of AI tools like ChatGPT and human teachers. For further research, refined collaborative learning scaffolding are recommended to explore the impact and potential of AI-assisted and inservice teacher-involved collaboration. The study’s implications could guide educators, policymakers, and AI developers in optimizing the AIenhanced collaborative learning strategies and shed light on the new formation of human-machine collaborative intelligence in the scope of education.

# Introduction

In recent decades, there has been a shift in educational priorities, with STEM education being integrated at a strategic level by numerous countries (Zhan et al., 2022a; Zhan & Niu, 2023). Integrated STEM (iSTEM) education refers to the STEM themed learning that is formed through active consultation among multiple disciplines due to the inter-related content or methodology (Kelley & Knowles, 2016). Learners are expected to go beyond the perspective of a single discipline, integrating knowledge, methodologies, and ways of thinking from at least two disciplines to understand and address complex problems in real-world scenarios (English, 2016; Haas et al., 2021; Zhan et al., 2022b). In this context, conducting iSTEM teaching is a complex and challenging task, necessitating teachers to have both professional theoretical knowledge and practical skills in STEM education (Haas et al., 2021). The availability of well-qualified teachers is deemed essential for the realization of this vision, driving universities and educational departments to enhance the training of student (or pre-service) teachers to meet the real teaching demands and teach iSTEM topics with high-level STEM pedagogical expertise (Chai, 2019; Morris et al., 2021).

Given these challenges, integrating generative AI into education, such as the conversational chatbot ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, presents a promising solution for teacher training. In iSTEM education, ChatGPT can participate as a conversationalist, content provider, assistant, and evaluator (Lo, 2023), offering a variety of functions including behaviour detection, knowledge transfer, question generation, performance assessment, tutoring, and resource recommendation (Xu & Ouyang, 2022). ChatGPT, as an accelerator for student teachers to understand STEM teaching knowledge and solve problems (Ji et al., 2023), can facilitate interdisciplinary teaching innovation (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Clearly, the integration of AI in education highlights the evolving collaborative learning relationship between humans and machines (Xu & Ouyang, 2022; Zhang & Aslan, 2021). However, caution is needed regarding the potential risks and challenges posed by generative AI, such as the production of incorrect or false information (Cooper, 2023), circumventing plagiarism detectors (Lo, 2023), causing adversarial impacts on cognitive autonomy, weakening individual agency, and leading to superficial and homogenized thinking (Rani et al., 2023). Therefore, the effective application of ChatGPT in teacher education systems requires careful consideration. Teachers and students should possess a certain level of digital literacy and ethical standards to face these challenges (Krügel et al., 2023) and devise appropriate strategies for integrating AI tools into the curriculum (Rudolph et al., 2023; Tan, 2022).

Besides, collaborating with experienced teachers is also a key approach to enriching the preparation of student STEM teacher candidates. These interactions enable student teachers to more effectively grasp the dynamics of real classroom environments (K. Huang et al., 2011), and help bridge the often-seen theory-practice gap in teacher education (Brown, 2017). Moreover, in an era of rapid technological advancement, the value of human interaction has been underscored (Guzman & Lewis, 2020). Such interactions significantly foster the identity formation of student teachers, reduce alienation among practitioners, and aid in the intergenerational transmission of the teaching profession (Estapa & Tank, 2017; Geeraerts et al., 2018; Harlow & Cobb, 2014; Näykki et al., 2021). While practitioner pairing learning can offer rich, context-sensitive insights, practical constraints such as availability, power dynamics, depth of collaboration, sustainability, and scalability pose significant challenges (Näykki et al., 2021). The effectiveness of this expert practitioner-supported learning model, as compared to AI-driven learning, remains an unresolved question in the context of STEM teacher training.

Recognizing the potential benefits and challenges of AI-assisted learning and collaboration with in-service teachers, this study aims to compare the effects of “human-human” and “human-machine” collaborative learning approaches on the performance of student STEM teacher training programmes through quasi-experimental research, elucidating their respective potentials and shortcomings.

# Literature review

For STEM teachers, they need to cultivate key competences which are critical to the success of teaching iSTEM content more efficiently, like cognition (e.g., knowledge of STEM education), teaching plan design and implementation (e.g., collaborate with teachers of other subjects in building and assigning STEM topics) (X. Chen, 2020; Dare et al., 2018; Shernoff et al., 2017; Song & Zhou, 2021). Besides, in STEM education, cultivating 21st-century skills, especially critical thinking, highlights the crucial need for enhancing teachers’ proficiency in critical thinking (e.g., by framing and stimulating about why they do what they do) (Song & Zhou, 2021; Tiatri et al., 2023). At the same time, given the complexity of STEM education, it is essential to consider the challenges in teachers’ professional learning to ensure an appropriate cognitive load (Timothy et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). This is crucial for enhancing STEM teaching resilience and teacher retention. Accordingly, for STEM teachers, collaboration has become the most commonly reported method of STEM teacher training (B. Huang et al., 2022; Willegems et al., 2017). Effective collaboration enhances STEM teachers’ knowledge, abilities, and emotional performance in STEM education (X. Chen, 2020; Song & Zhou, 2021). With the advancement of AI technology, the scope of collaboration partners has expanded from humans to machines. Based on this, the following text will review existing research on collaboration between humans and human-machine collaborative learning.

# AI-assisted learning in student teacher training

In the era of Industry 4.0, the integration of AI into the educational landscape has been extended to student teacher training (Carrillo & Flores, 2020; Lo, 2023). ChatGPT, representing conversational AI, can simulate various human emotions and tones and understanding and responding to complex requests in a near-natural manner (King & ChatGPT, 2023). Compared to traditional chatbots, ChatGPT can be integrated through API into various platforms and tools, enabling real-time interactions with student teachers. Consequently, there is emerging evidence suggests that AI tools, exemplified by ChatGPT, can be effectively integrated into student teacher training as expert mentors, intelligent study companions, and smart assistants, enhancing learning across various environments (Lo, 2023; Stokel-Walker, 2022).

For example, ChatGPT can enhance the understanding of STEM subject knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and teaching methodologies (Patel & Lam, 2023). Playing the role of a one-toone tutor, it acts as an accelerator of knowledge dissemination. Incorporating ChatGPT’s expertise allows for real-time negotiations based on student teachers’ unique requirements. By processing relevant data, and generating cross-modal teaching resources (Cooper, 2023), ChatGPT provides pertinent cognitive feedback derived from data-driven insights, helping reduce learners’ low-order cognitive load. Additionally, ChatGPT can assist teachers in generating cross-modal teaching resources, such as creating instructional designs and templates consistent with STEM themes. This provides particular value for navigating the nuances of STEM teaching practices. It equips student teachers to efficiently filter and assimilate information, sparking discussions that foster divergent thinking (Organisciak et al., 2023). This, in turn, frees up cognitive resources for higher-order cognitive activities (Farrokhnia et al., 2023). It can be observed that the convenience and effectiveness brought by ChatGPT in assisting STEM student teacher training have been recognized by education professionals.

However, the integration of AI in student teacher training is not without its challenges (X. Chen et al., 2020; X. Chen et al., 2022). Concerns have also been raised, including the ability of AI to cater to the relational facets of teaching, such as empathy and emotional understanding (Taber, 2019). Questions also persist about ethical and equity issues, as not all student teachers might have equal access to or familiarity with such advanced technologies. Additionally, the effective integration of AI tools into the curriculum remains a complex issue that requires careful planning and consideration (J. Kim et al., 2022).

Overall, at present, there is no unified conclusion on ChatGPT’s impact on individual learning, and some studies may overstate its effects. Moreover, the potential negative impact of pre-service teachers’ dependency on ChatGPT for learning outcomes requires insightful conclusions. These areas warrant further investigation in future studies.

# Collaboration with in-service teachers in student STEM teacher’s learning

Student STEM teachers face real challenges in teacher training programmes, including limited disciplinary or interdisciplinary knowledge, difficulties in adapting to pedagogical methods and classroom roles, lack of time and expertise in curriculum integration, and the absence of knowledge regarding relevant standards and assessments (Chai, 2019; B. Huang et al., 2022). Besides, the current teacher education system, largely dominated by universities, has been criticized for various issues such as a detachment from practical experience, arbitrary assembly of teacher education courses, fragmented and incoherent content, and a lack of connection with primary and secondary schools (Kostiainen et al., 2018; Radloff & Guzey, 2016). Traditional student teacher and in-service teacher professional development programmes often exacerbate this problem by emphasizing the development of teachers’ skills and knowledge in one domain, rather than preparing them for interdisciplinary domains (Brown, 2017; Chai, 2019; Honey et al., 2014; B. Huang et al., 2022; Lo, 2021).

Neglecting targeted training for iSTEM teaching capabilities, it leads to new teachers finding themselves ill-equipped to handle STEM teaching once they enter the profession. Consequently, teachers have expressed concerns about their readiness to carry out STEM education, particularly iSTEM (Lau & Jong, 2022). To overcome these barriers, the cross-boundary integration of multiple resources for STEM teacher education is emerging as a promising solution (Kelley et al., 2020; B. Kim & Bastani, 2017). It has been suggested that higher education institutions must bolster their alliances with primary and secondary schools to address present challenges. This form of collaboration can expose student teachers to the real-world dynamics of a classroom, aiding them in understanding the practical implications of their academic learning (Schmid & Hegelheimer, 2014). In-service teachers, with their hands-on experience and insights, can provide student teachers with valuable mentorship (Sá & de Almeida, 2016). This mentorship can take several forms, including providing advice on teaching strategies, classroom management, student assessment, and navigating the broader educational landscape (Näykki et al., 2021).

However, collaborative learning between student teachers and in-service teachers is not without its difficulties. Among these are the power imbalance between the two groups, cognitive differences obstructing consensus in collaborative learning, and the necessity for an intermediary mechanism to foster cooperation (Li et al., 2023; Meschede et al., 2017; Willegems et al., 2017). Moreover, the conflict between work and learning constraints often undermines the potential for sustained, in-depth collaboration. In addition, existing research is mostly conducted outside the formal university classroom, the collaborative learning of student teachers or teachers is mostly based on peer collaboration, and there is still a lack of understanding that teachers and student teachers are regarded as a teacher learning community. The collaboration with in-service teachers during student teacher training has not been extensively studied and recognized for its potential benefits.

Drawing from the reviewed literature, we recognize the potential of both AI-assisted learning, specifically through platforms like ChatGPT, and collaborative learning with inservice teachers, in shaping student teachers’ experiences in the context of iSTEM education. However, a gap remains in understanding how these two collaborative learning methods compare in terms of enhancing key components of student teachers’ STEM teaching training, such as critical thinking, learning performance, and cognitive load. This uncharted territory necessitates empirical investigation. Consequently, this study will venture into this underexplored domain and address the identified gap through the lens of the following research questions. These questions aim to discern which method more effectively augments student teachers’ proficiency in the context of collaborative STEM learning course. Accordingly, the following three research questions were proposed:

Research Question 1 (RQ1): Which collaborative learning method can better promote the development of critical thinking skills among student teachers within a iSTEM teaching training course?

Research Question 2 (RQ2): Which collaborative learning method is more effective in improving the learning performance of student teachers in the iSTEM teaching training course?

Research Question 3 (RQ3): Which collaborative learning method leads to a lower cognitive load for student teachers throughout their iSTEM teaching training?

# Methodology

# Participants and procedure

This quasi-experimental study adopted in-service teacher-student teacher pairing learning (TSPL) and ChatGPT-student teacher pairing learning (CSPL) for both experimental treatments. The participants were 23 master’s students majoring in educational technology at a public normal university in Guangdong Province, China (with a mean age of 24.4 years), and a teaching team composed of one lead instructor and four collaborative teaching professors with extensive teaching and research experience in STEM education from the same university. Two doctoral students also participated in the course as teaching assistants. The study adopted a randomized grouping design. Before the experiment, the teacher informed students of the two pairing methods and understood their preferences. Regarding the potential issue that selection bias might impact the results, students were then divided into two groups by a random lottery draw in the course: an TSPL group and a CSPL group. Finally, there were one male and eleven female students in TSPL group $( N = 1 2 )$ ), and four male and seven female students in CSPL group $( N = 1 1 )$ . Besides, students from the TSPL group were individually paired with twelve in-service teachers, including seven females and five males, all with over three years of STEM teaching experience. These teachers, voluntarily participating from Guangdong Province, China, are integral to the ongoing long-term STEM teaching research led by the research team.

Before implementing the course curriculum, teaching assistant A spent an hour introducing student teachers paired with ChatGPT to its usage. This encompassed how to use ChatGPT, the tool’s limitations, and its applications in teaching. To ensure the integrity of the experiment, this session was not made available to student teachers paired with in-service teachers. Meanwhile, teaching assistant B guided the students paired with in-service teachers, discussing strategies for effective collaboration, scheduled communication times, mutual expectations, and contact details.

The purpose of offering this iSTEM teaching training course is to equip student teachers with the theories and methods of STEM education and to allow them to try their hands at designing iSTEM lessons. Consequently, the students attended eight 3-h lessons focused on the fundamentals of iSTEM education and the development of iSTEM teaching cases. As shown in Table 1, the learning content covered five main themes, encompassing both theoretical knowledge and practical teaching case design guidance. iSTEM teaching design and practice follow the “C-Pote” framework proposed in previous research (Zhan et al., 2023), including conceptual group, problem chain, objective layer, task cluster and evidence set (see Table 1 for detailed explanation). After class, students were assigned to complete four tasks based on the course, and task records were meticulously maintained in both the TSPL group and the CSPL group. These records provided invaluable data, capturing the trajectory of students’ problem-solving journeys within their respective collaborative learning environments. Finally, except for the tasks, each student also needed to complete a proposal design of iSTEM-based interdisciplinary thematic teaching and implementation. Besides, ten-minute pre- and post-test questionnaires were administered to the students on the first and last day of the course, respectively. After the course, students also submitted their own reflection reports on course learning. This feedback helps to continuously optimize the course. During the learning process, both groups of students were exposed to identical content and were required to accomplish the same post-lesson tasks and the final teaching design proposal.

# Instruments

To verify the effectiveness of both ChatGPT and in-service teacher assistance for student teachers’ collaborative learning in the iSTEM teaching training course, this study compared the effects of these two collaborative learning methods on three variables: critical thinking, learning performance, and cognitive load. The overall research design is illustrated in Figure 1.

# Critical thinking questionnaire

The critical thinking skills of the student teachers were assessed using a modified version of C. C. Chen’s (2000) questionnaire, which is mainly based on the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) (Facione et al., 2000). The test includes five measurement dimensions: truth-seeking (3 items, Cronbach’s $\mathtt { q } = . 8 3 0 \}$ , such as “When I realize my opinion is incorrect, I am willing to change it”, open-mindedness (7 items, Cronbach’s $\mathtt { a } = . 8 8 7 \mathrm { . }$ ), like “During discussions with others, I strive to understand and listen to opinions different from my own”, analyticity (3 items, Cronbach’s $\mathtt { q } = . 6 3 2 $ ), like “When I encounter challenges, I try to find out the reasons and think of solutions”, systematicity (8 items, Cronbach’s $\mathtt { q } = . 8 3 6 )$ ), such as “When others raise questions, I reflect on matters related to their concerns”, and inquisitiveness (7 items, Cronbach’s ${ \tt a } = . 8 2 6 )$ , such as “I find that I enjoy solving challenging problems”.

# Learning performance evaluation

The task performance evaluation was designed to examine the student teachers’ iSTEM teaching knowledge and skills. It consisted of the four process learning tasks based on the course framework, and an open-ended project design task also asked student teachers to “Design a iSTEM teaching project through collaboration with your partner”. The assessment of student teachers’ performance in both process-based and summative learning tasks is conducted using the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) (Baer et al., 2004). This approach relies on the student teachers’ submitted records of process-based tasks and their final design proposals to evaluate their performance. Specifically, one of the teaching assistants anonymized the assignments. Subsequently, the student’ assignments were evaluated by both the course’s lead professor and the two teaching assistants, and these evaluators have no conflict of interest with the student teachers. This collaborative assessment was intended to ensure robust, professional evaluations and consistent feedback.

# Cognitive load questionnaire

Cognitive load was assessed using a single-item measure as an indicator of the mental effort expended by the student teachers for learning this course, drawing on the work of Paas et al. (2003). The student teachers were asked to rate their perceived cognitive load on a scale from 1 (very low) to 9 (very high), like “On a scale of 1–9, how would you rate the effort you put into the learning activities of this course? (1: Very easy, requiring minimal mental effort; 9: Very challenging, requiring a significant amount of mental effort)”. This measure provides an indication of self-perceived cognitive burden associated with the learning process, thus contributing a key element to our comprehensive evaluation of the two collaboration methods on student teachers’ iSTEM teaching training.

# Content analysis of learning reflections and interviews

Additionally, to gain a deeper understanding of how student teachers learning through collaboration with ChatGPT or in-service teachers in the iSTEM training course, the research incorporated qualitative content analysis. Specifically, by examining their submitted course reflection reports, 6 student teachers were selected from two groups (3 from each group) for interviews (15–30 minutes each) to comprehensively explore the impact of different collaboration approaches on them.

# Results

Considering the small sample sizes, non-parametric tests were employed in the research to compare the learning performance in critical thinking, STEM teaching learning performance and cognitive load between the TSPL and CSPL groups. To answer the research questions, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank

Tests were performed to analyse differences between pre- and post-test scores (see Table 2). Besides, Mann-Whitney U Tests were conducted to assess the differences between groups in post-test scores (see Table 3). SPSS 25 was used to analyse the data.

# Critical thinking

Regarding the critical thinking factor, the CSPL group exhibited improvements in all items. Notably, systematicity $\scriptstyle ( Z = - 1 . 9 9 0$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 4 7 .$ ) and the overall critical thinking score $( Z = - 2 . 1 9 7$ , $p = 0 . 0 2 8 $ ) achieved statistical significance. On the other hand, the TSPL group also showed slight improvements in scores but did not achieve statistical significance. In the post-test, aside from systematicity $( Z = - 2 . 2 0 0$ , $p =$ 0.028), no notable differences in critical thinking were observed between the two groups.

In addition, in their reflective reports, student teacher from CSPL group noted that “When seeking straightforward answers to simple questions, ChatGPT’s responses are more direct and clear-cut compared to conventional search engines, reducing the costs of information filtering and practical application. However, the accuracy remains to be validated”. Another feedback states, “When I asked ChatGPT for literature recommendations, it provided titles, but no matter how I searched, I couldn’t locate those articles. Hence, we should approach ChatGPT’s responses with a critical mindset”. These feedbacks provided supplementary evidences on ChatGPT’s prowess in fostering critical thinking among student teachers. Meanwhile, the TSPL group’s student teacher L also noted: “Teacher A could not directly respond to my questions, and her answers were often beside the point. However, her practical experience insights were highly beneficial to me”.

# Learning performance

In terms of learning performance, the post-test scores for the CSPL group for iSTEM teaching proposal design was lower than the TSPL group, but not reached statistical significance $_ { ( Z = - 1 . 9 4 7 }$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 5 1$ ). While in task 1 $\scriptstyle ( Z = - 2 . 0 6 2$ , $p = 0 . 0 3 9 )$ ), task 2 $\scriptstyle ( Z = - 3 . 3 4 5$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 1$ ), task 3 $\scriptstyle ( Z = - 2 . 4 1 0$ , $p =$ 0.016), and task 4 $( Z { = } { - } 2 . 0 7 5$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 3 8$ ), the CSPL group was found performed significantly better than the teacher group in all four items. Similarly, in terms of the task average scores, the CSPL group significantly outperformed the TSPL $( Z = - 3 . 2 0 2$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 1$ ).

Student teacher also mentioned, “when initially formulating an interdisciplinary concept, I hadn’t considered the connection between AI-enabled palace lantern manufacturing and the concept of ‘sustainable development’. Upon querying ChatGPT, I learned that creating digitalized palace lanterns using AI technology can reduce energy consumption, promoting societal sustainability”.

# Cognitive load

For the cognitive load factor, the post-test score of the CSPL group (Mean Rank $= 9 . 0 9$ , Sum of Ranks $= 1 0 0 . 0 0 )$ was lower than the TSPL group (Mean Rank $= 1 4 . 6 7$ , Sum of Ranks $= 1 7 6 . 0 0 \mathrm { \ : }$ ), indicating a significant difference between the two groups $\scriptstyle ( Z = - 2 . 0 4 6$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 4 1$ ).

The student teachers from the CSPL group also mentioned, “After training or role-playing with ChatGPT, the overall user experience is positive, and it can answer my questions at any time. During the interactive communication, I noticed that many of its responses surpassed my initial preconceived answers to the questions, which helped expand my learning horizons”. “Through error correction and follow-up questions, ChatGPT’s application enhanced my understanding of the core concepts of the chosen iSTEM theme, allowing me to further inquire about more abstract and advanced content”. “When posing questions to ChatGPT and providing a thought framework, its responses are structured and logical. Although there is still a lack in comprehensiveness and depth, it can help fill in the gaps”. “Although the course was challenging, when completing tasks with certain cognitive loads, there are still significant takeaways. By practically solving a specific teaching design task, I can gain more practical experience in interdisciplinary theme learning design”.

While feedback from the TSPL group suggested “strengthening the guidance on iSTEM teaching theories for in-service teachers. Before the course starts, these teachers should first be introduced to the relevant theories, or student teachers should be organized to discuss them together”. Other student teachers commented, “My own understanding can limit the effectiveness of pairing with teachers. Without a deep understanding of the frontline situation, it’s challenging to communicate well with paired teachers. Such communication can decrease my enthusiasm, making me feel that I cannot complete my assignment with the paired teacher”.

# Discussion

According to the results reported in section 4, both the CSPL group and the TSPL group demonstrated the effectiveness of the collaborative learning method. And the ChatGPT and teacher collaborations each exhibited strengths and weaknesses in the STEM teaching training course for student teachers.

RQ1: Which collaborative learning method can better promote the development of critical thinking skills among student teachers within a iSTEM teaching training course?

As for RQ1, there is a significant difference in the pre-test and post-test scores among CSPL group, demonstrating that the use of ChatGPT can enhance student teachers’ critical thinking skills. This discovery is in line with previous studies, reinforcing the assertion that AI chatbots such as ChatGPT can play a crucial role in fostering student teachers’ critical thinking (Rusandi et al., 2023). Due to the significant challenges for the iSTEM teaching training course, and considering the uncertainty brought about by AI technology, the teacher apprised student teachers of ChatGPT’s potential inaccuracies and the possibility of misleading information (Fergus et al., 2023). As a result, when student teachers faced cognitive conflicts provoked by ChatGPT’s responses (Ciechanowski et al., 2019), they were spurred to critically reflect upon these answers and cross-verify their thoughts with reputable journal articles, or to improve the prompts, reflecting certain aspects of critical thinking. The traits of critical thinking primarily encompass questioning, reasoning, and reflection. It’s the capability to make rational decisions about what to believe and what to do.

Similarly, TSPL group also witnessed a slight increase in critical thinking scores. The reasons might be, the present iSTEM teaching training course, designed to equip student teachers with the theoretical knowledge and “C-POTE” practice model of interdisciplinary learning in the context of the Chinese new curriculum, introduces numerous fresh concepts and design paradigms. Curiosity and desire for knowledge are important foundations for cultivating critical thinking, therefore, the course content itself could foster the critical thinking. Questions posed by student teachers, such as, “What are the big ideas and their hierarchical systems?” or “What are the pathways to extracting the big ideas of the interdisciplinary themes?” – were questions that in-service teachers often struggled to provide explicit answers to certain queries. Furthermore, because of the complexion and openness of these questions, coupled with the limited training or seminars, in-service teachers had to communicate with student teachers by relying solely on their practical iSTEM teaching experiences. It leaves room for independent and critical thinking by student teachers. Hence, while completing their assignments, student teachers need critically consider the answers provided by in-service teachers.

The Mann-Whitney U test showed no statistical difference of the whole score of critical thinking between the two pairing methods. One reason could be the small sample size in both groups, which could affect the results. Another reason might be the high difficulty level of the course, requiring student teachers to critically evaluate answers provided by either ChatGPT or in-service teachers when confronted with new concepts and instruction philosophies. However, a statistical difference was found in the post-test scores for the systematicity dimension. As ChatGPT can assist student teachers in solving problems anytime and anywhere, they were able to maintain high concentration on problem-solving. Meanwhile, due to their heavy workload, in-service teachers often struggled to communicate timely and effectively to student teachers’ questions and difficulties. Therefore, CSPL group scored higher on the “systemic” dimension compared to TSPL group.

RQ2: Which collaborative learning method is more effective in improving the learning performance of student teachers in the iSTEM teaching training course?

In addressing RQ2, it was observed that student teachers who collaborated with ChatGPT generally submitted those 4 task assignments of higher quality, thus achieving greater scores compared to those paired with in-service teachers. Consequently, using ChatGPT can enhance student teachers’ task performance, corroborating the existing findings (Biswas, 2023; Strzelecki, 2023). In this study, the complexity of the four assigned tasks was purposefully structured to prevent copying, demanding thoughtful analysis and reflection for completion. Additionally, interaction logs with ChatGPT were mandated for submission by student teachers. ChatGPT’s rapid response to queries provided diverse insights on STEM topics, aiding student teachers in their analytical and creative thinking, and identifying assignment issues (Zhai, 2023), thereby producing assignments of superior efficiency and quality.

The qualitative content further enriches the interpretation of this outcome. As the student teacher mentioned, “Throughout the course, I gained an initial understanding of how ChatGPT can empower teachers in preparing for STEM-themed lessons”. Specifically, first, with ChatGPT serving as an advanced knowledge management tool, it can refine and apply insights from a wealth of materials, thereby reducing the burden of lesson planning for teachers. Second, ChatGPT acts as an “all-subject teacher”, assisting in interdisciplinary knowledge integration during collaborative discussions and facilitating co-planning for specialized teachers. Third, GPT contributes to fostering interdisciplinary teaching innovation by assisting teachers in providing prompt clarifications and facilitating divergent thinking. When dealing with segmented process-oriented learning tasks, student teachers showed a generally positive response to the overall assistance provided by ChatGPT.

In the broader context of STEM teaching proposal design, the integration of these four assignments was pivotal. Sharing of exemplary assignments among student teachers encouraged intergroup learning and emulation. Conversely, student teachers who partnered with in-service teachers benefitted from practical insights, resulting in STEM teaching proposal designs that were more comprehensive, grounded, and applicable, with stronger consideration of students’ actual needs and conditions. Consequently, the proposal design outcomes of student teachers collaborating with inservice teachers proved more effective. This result further reaffirms the importance of collaborative learning with in-service teachers in the STEM teaching training course. Given the inherent complexity of STEM teaching, student teachers need to immerse themselves in schools to experience authentic teaching situations. They should understand how teachers organize students for inquiry-based activities and acquire practical STEM teaching knowledge, methods, and experiences (Vangrieken et al., 2015). Thus, during this course, six student teachers proactively reached out to in-service teachers to observe STEM classroom teaching in primary and secondary schools. They discussed face-to-face the cognition, design, implementation, and reflection related to STEM teaching, enhancing their overall understanding of integrated STEM education. Some student teachers commented after their firsthand experience, “I never realized that actual STEM teaching was so fascinating, yet so challenging to execute”.

In short, for short-term, well-defined, knowledge-based and less innovative STEM collaborative teaching design tasks, pairing with ChatGPT led to better outcomes compared to pairing with inservice teachers. However, for complex, highly innovative, open-ended and systematic collaborative teaching design tasks that require sustained in-depth interaction, pairing with in-service teachers was more beneficial. Therefore, a synergistic combination of these collaborative strategies, leveraging strengths and compensating for weaknesses, promises to optimize the learning performance of student teachers.

RQ3: Which collaborative learning method leads to a lower cognitive load for student teachers throughout their iSTEM teaching training?

For RQ3, a significant difference was observed in the post-test scores of cognitive load between student teachers paired with ChatGPT and those paired with in-service teachers. This implies that the aid of ChatGPT in completing tasks and resolving ill-structured problems can reduce cognitive load, consistent with the existing findings (Ji et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023). Because ChatGPT can interpret subtle linguistic variations and react appropriately (Zhai et al., 2023), it can mitigate the mental effort expended by student teachers in processing and understanding iSTEM-related knowledge and concepts. Despite not always providing completely accurate answers, however, its expeditious responses and its capacity to promote both divergent and convergent thinking (Mukherjee & Chang, 2023) can still lessen the cognitive effort for student teachers.

In contrast, student teachers paired with in-service teachers often struggle to get accurate explanations for complex and abstract problems and concepts in their assignments. They frequently need to invest additional time and energy in literature review and external assistance, thereby maintaining a high cognitive load. Indeed, the primary goal of this iSTEM teaching training course is to promote active learning and inquiry through complex and authentic problems or concepts (Dwivedi et al., 2023; Patel & Lam, 2023), which might impose additional cognitive demands on student teachers, hence the high cognitive load in both groups (Gupta & Zheng, 2020).

While ChatGPT exhibits proficiency in handling common sense problems (Ray, 2023), it falls short in processing experiential and sociocultural knowledge, essentially functioning as an inexperienced problem solver in these domains. Hence, in-service teachers, with their wealth of experience, can provide such knowledge to student teachers, potentially reducing the mental effort involved in understanding such knowledge. However, given the personal, impartible, and experiential nature of such knowledge, it is challenging to quantify, offering fertile ground for further in-depth exploration.

# Conclusion

To cultivate student teacher with excellent iSTEM teacher characteristics, the deployment of AI tools and the collaboration with in-service teachers stand out as promising strategies in contemporary student teacher education. Despite calls from existing research to strengthen collaborative learning, there remains a dearth of in-depth empirical research in this area. Our study attempts to bridge this gap by exploring the efficacy of different collaborative learning methods – AI-assisted learning with ChatGPT and collaboration with in-service teachers – in enhancing student teachers’ iSTEM teaching training course. Both collaborative learning methods showcased their distinct strengths. On one hand, ChatGPT’s user-friendliness, high interactivity, and robust database support proved beneficial in helping student teachers learn complex iSTEM teaching knowledge, hone critical thinking skills, improve learning efficiency, and reduce cognitive load. On the other hand, the involvement of in-service teachers facilitated a two-way exchange of theoretical knowledge and practical wisdom, offering a more realistic understanding of iSTEM teaching scenarios. This interaction helped student teachers develop high-quality iSTEM teaching proposals and exhibit improved iSTEM teaching ability.

We propose that a blend of both collaborative learning methods would cater to the diverse and personalized iSTEM teaching needs of student teachers. For instance, while ChatGPT could be efficiently employed for acquiring basic knowledge and skills, the invaluable practical wisdom of inservice teachers could be leveraged for more complex and experiential learning. To facilitate these collaborative learning methods, educators and policymakers must provide further support, such as structuring progressive learning tasks, managing learning difficulty, and fostering long-term collaboration between universities and primary and secondary schools. Moreover, care must be taken to provide clear guidance on the use of tools like ChatGPT to avoid potential ethical risks. Overall, both collaborative approaches have their advantages in cultivating student teachers. Future studies can further explore ways to integrate and apply them.

However, our study’s results might be impacted by limited participant numbers, restricted to technical major graduate students, and the short experimental period. In this exploratorystudy, even though we have attempted an empirical comparative study, some of the effects are borderline in terms of significance, and the effect sizes are also small on some indicators. Besides, more formal and comprehensive assessment of ChatGPT on its ability to help with iSTEM education-related topics are needed, especially when the teaching content is related to localized iSTEM teaching training course. Therefore, future research involving longer experimental periods, more adaptable learning scaffold design, and a more diverse and larger participant group is required to train high-quality iSTEM teachers for an AI-driven future.
