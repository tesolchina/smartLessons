# Introduction

Story writing plays a vital role in children’s development as it nurtures their creativity, imagination and critical thinking (Marcos et al., 2020). It also enhances their language and communication abilities, aiding them in learning spelling, vocabulary, grammar, punctuation, language comprehension and narrative structure (Smith-Lock et al., 2009). Story writing enables students to organize their thoughts, develop logical reasoning and enhance problem-solving skills (Ensminger et al., 2021). When students engage in digital story writing, they have the opportunity to express their ideas through various digital media, such as embedding images and animations, thereby fostering their language skills, creative thinking and digital literacy (Fang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022). However, many students struggle with story writing due to challenges such as a lack of ideas, limited vocabulary and difficulty in finding the appropriate style, which can result in anxiety and frustration (Fang et al., 2023). Sudowrite, an online tool powered by natural language generation (NLG), utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to generate human-like language. It serves as a catalyst for stimulating writers’ creativity and providing support for their story writing. However, there is a scarcity of studies that explore the capabilities of this technology. Therefore, this review aims to present an overview of Sudowrite’s features and examine its potential in enhancing students’ creative writing skills.

# Affordances for Creative Story Writing

Sudowrite, an AI-empowered writing tool developed in 2020 by Amit Gupta and James Yu, offers users a range of features and plans for an enhanced writing experience. Upon registration, users are granted a free trial with access to 50,000 AI-generated words. To cater to different usage needs, Sudowrite provides three distinct plans for users to choose from. The student plan allows users to generate up to 225,000 AI words per month, while the professional and max plans offer the capacity for 450,000 and 2,000,000 AI words, respectively.

Sudowrite comprises four major features: Write, Describe, Rewrite and Brainstorm (see Figure 1). Write generates text that continues from a user’s input, providing them with inspiration when they encounter creative blocks. Describe assists the user in portraying story elements using the five senses and metaphor to elaborate on the ideas in the user’s story. Rewrite rephrases the user’s text to enhance its descriptiveness and intensity, which is particularly valuable for non-native English-language writers. Brainstorm facilitates the creation of story elements such as characters, places and dialogues.

Figure 2 illustrates how a user can describe characters, provide additional story information and give examples, with Sudowrite generating a list of characters based on this input.

These four features can support users at different stages of their story writing process. Users can begin by using the Brainstorm feature to create characters, setting and plots, initiating their story. They can then proceed to write an outline of their story on the main interface. When facing writer’s block or a lack of ideas for story development, the Write feature can provide the necessary inspiration to move forward. Subsequently, users can use the Describe feature to add detailed elements, bringing their story to completion. Finally, users can proofread their story and enhance its language using the Rewrite feature, which enables them to rephrase words and sentences as needed.

Sudowrite extends its capabilities beyond story writing, offering support for screenplays and emotional poems as well. Its Plugins feature includes additional tools like Shrink Ray and Character. With Shrink Ray, users can generate loglines, blurbs, synopses and full outlines by uploading their manuscripts. This feature also allows writers to explore potential plot twists, injecting dramatic shifts into the trajectory of their fiction. On the other hand, Character assists in the development of characters by enriching character sheets and world-building documents with visually appealing artwork generated from textual descriptions. This feature contributes to breathing life into the characters, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.

When comparing Sudowrite to other similar tools like WordTune, Quilbot and Jenni.ai, Sudowrite excels at supporting writers in the creative writing process, particularly in the creation of novels and screenplays. WordTune and Quilbot, on the other hand, are more suitable for rewriting and rephrasing written content, such as emails, social media posts and instant messages, primarily for business and work purposes. Jenni.ai focuses on improving writing skills, research papers and in-text citations in an academic context. Although all these tools utilize NLG to generate responses based on provided topics or questions and offer features for rephrasing, lengthening, shortening and summarizing text, Sudowrite differentiates itself by specifically catering to creative writing and providing guidance for various elements like characterization. Sudowrite not only assists writers, but also offers explanations and instructions on constructing prompts and making informed choices, making it a valuable tool for writers engaged in the creative process.

Additionally, Sudowrite differs from generative AI tools like ChatGPT. Whereas ChatGPT may be more effective for general language-learning purposes (Kohnke et al., 2023), Sudowrite offers specialized scaffolding to assist students in composing stories. Another notable distinction is that Sudowrite allows students to generate output effortlessly by clicking a button, eliminating the need to write a prompt themselves. This feature is particularly useful for students who may not be familiar with professional terms related to writing styles and rhetoric.

Sudowrite can offer valuable integration into the writing classroom, providing support for teaching and learning writing skills. Teachers can utilize this tool in various ways to enhance their students’ writing abilities. For example, teachers can employ Sudowrite to generate sample stories, utilizing the modeling teaching method to facilitate students’ understanding of story writing. Additionally, teachers can encourage students to use Sudowrite as a writing companion, enabling them to practice and refine their story writing skills. Moreover, teachers can incorporate the tool by assigning students to record their usage and subsequently evaluate their writing process, providing targeted and effective feedback for improvement.

However, there are certain challenges associated with the use of Sudowrite. One challenge is ensuring that students use the tool ethically and responsibly $\mathrm { N g }$ et al., 2021). It is important for students to understand that relying solely on Sudowrite to write assignments without their own effort would be considered academic misconduct. Additionally, students, particularly beginners, may encounter difficulties in evaluating the appropriateness and quality of the AI-generated suggestions provided by Sudowrite. This can lead to confusion and potentially hinder their learning process. To address these challenges, it is crucial for teachers to actively monitor students’ use of the tool and provide guidance. For instance, teachers can make use of the History feature (see Figure 1) to review students’ use of Sudowrite throughout their writing process and identify any instances of misuse. Furthermore, teachers can incorporate a reflective journaling activity where students maintain a journal to document their experiences, observations and challenges encountered while using Sudowrite. These journals can be periodically reviewed by teachers, allowing for personalized feedback and addressing any concerns or misconceptions. Additionally, teachers can facilitate peer collaboration by pairing students and encouraging them to engage in discussions about their thought process when accepting or rejecting the AI-generated suggestions.

# Conclusion

Creative writing is essential for students, but it can pose challenges. Therefore, it is crucial to provide students with the necessary tools to enhance their creative writing abilities. Sudowrite can be an invaluable tool in this regard, and we recommend its incorporation into writing instruction. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that NLG tools have limitations when it comes to generating entirely original ideas. Although they can utilize existing data to generate language, they cannot generate new concepts that are not already present in the database. Idea creation necessitates human creativity to produce innovative and novel ideas. Thus, although NLG can serve as a helpful tool for producing written content, it cannot substitute for the human capacity for idea generation. Ultimately, the finest writing emerges from the amalgamation of human creativity and NLG technology.
