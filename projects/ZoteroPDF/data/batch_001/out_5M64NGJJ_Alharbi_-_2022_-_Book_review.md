Shapiro's (2022) newly published book Cultivating Critical Language Awareness inthe Writing Classroom i a great addition and response to the long-standing debate over the political and social struggle concerning what constitutes correct' standardized and conventionalized language. Positioning herself in the middle of two varying schools, pragmatism and progressvism, she critically enacted a proactive stance that encompases both schools of thought for teaching writing and literacy in today's multilingual/cultural classroms. This critical practical work aims to invoke a socially transformative vision from teachers; it aids students in questioning asymmetrical power rlations, raises citical awarenes of how \*the Self and the Other are positioned in power herarchies" and inspires action to reform unjust assumptions and structures around language use (Kubota, 2018, p. 2). Reinventing and reimagining a hopeful future for literacy and writing studies, Shapiro wondered how to teach writing socially and linguisticall in a just way while preparing diverse students for today's competitive job market. Rooting her argument in Critical Language Awareness (CLA) as an emancipatory pedagogical tol, the writer encouraged teachers to recognize differences and to teach as an oppositional practice. Compiling cutting edge empirical as well as theoretical studies from the writing and linguisics fields, Shapiro's manuscript targets a myriad of professionals. This textbook can be used by L2 writing teachers, educational linguis, and graduate students specializing in L2 writing and written communication who are interested in language ideology, critical writing approaches, and students empowerment through language. Shapiro supported her argument by clearly contextualizing and defining CLA whil showcasing it possible application in today's globalized, diverse classrooms. The book offers hands-on exercses roted in linguistc justice, eflexivity, and activities that cultivate students' rhetorical agency. Hence, writing teachers can use the book as a toolkit to help students cultivate rhetorical agency and awareness of language choices and uses.

The volume includes three main sections divided into ten chapters and the three main sections are: Foundations of CLA Pedagogy, Four Pathways for CLA Pedagogy, and Charting Your Own Journey with CLA Pedagogy. Each section emphasizes the importance of incorporating CLA as an empowering tool that can contribute to social and linguistic justice in writing classrooms. Moving beyond a cliched focus on simple diversity, the author firmly aserted that her main driving force for writing such a book is thateducators] do not just want to afirm the value of linguistic diversity ..they should promote] students' rhetorical agency--to empower them to use language for a variety of academic, professonal, civic, and personal purposes (p.3). Basing pedagogical choices, as shown in section I, on issues revolving around language, identity, privilege, and power' and deconstructing normality and standardization in and outside of academia may create opportunitie for increased relevance of academic content to rel life. In this section, readers can delve deeply into a comprehensive theoretical overview of CLA and its historical movements, uses, and possible applications in writing and literacy studies.

Interestingly, in section II of the book, Four Pathways for CLA Pedagogy, Shapiro carefully designed four effective pathways (Sociolinguistics, Critical Academic Literacies, Media/Discourse Analysis, and Communicating Across Difference) which teachers can apply in their writing classrooms as a flexible menu of possible combinations rather than a rigid recipe. Each of these four pathways is organized neatly and starts with an introduction, learning goals, essential questions, and transferable sils. Taking into consideration the context of each class she allowed prospective writing instructors to adopt the sequence of the activities to make them culturaly and linguistically appropriate. For instance, the sociolinguistic pathway, in chapter 4, provides esential information for teaching writing criticall. As stdents and instructors convere about sociolinguistic isue such as inguistic variation, linguistic profiling and discrimination, and inguistic atitude and preudice, students can become, through writing, advocates of ocial and linguistic justice by deconstructing linguistic oppression and whit supremacy. While reinforcing that the main goals of CLA are self-reflction, social justice, and rhetorical agency, the writer uggested many sociolinguistic questions in the writing classroom such as: To what extent does our language background influence how we experience the world?" (p.90). Another aspect of these four pathways is chapter 7, "Communicating Acros Difference. Drawing on interdisciplinary backgrounds, the writer stated that writing clsrooms are loaded with learning/teaching moments through dierences. Students and teachers can critically examine tensions, unequal power dynamics in the text, and patterns that index exclusion of certain social groups and/or inclusion of the dominant social group. The author succinctly walks readers through applicable activities such as writing and reflection on the power of language in fictional or real-life conversation; through this activity, teachers can help students become much more aware of the power of language while fostering students' rhetorical agency.

Section II, Charting Your Own Journey with CLA Pedagogy, shifts the focus from how and why CLA works in today's writing classoom to equipping teachers to tacticlly create CLA-focused units and courses. This section also takes into account how to assess student's needs that are relevant to writing teachers' instructional aims as explained in chapter 8. This chapter specificall is important for global writing teachers as it isbased on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to assure accessbility and inclusivity. Shapiro urgently exhorted teachers and provides efectie tols for cultivating CLA in classroom interactions around ll subjects. She encourages teachers to use a list of questions, as listed in Chapter 9. For instance, a teacher can ask a reflexive question such as: How might CLA shape or feedback, assesment, and evaluation practiceincluding how we attend to ssues of language and style?" Along with these questions, the chapter includes other related work published by the author about the student's conception of linguistic inclusivity in the writing clsroom. Moving beyond the academic sphere of CLA and how it afects pedagogical practice, as explained in chapter 10, Shapiro offered an extensivesection that eplains the relationship between CLA and daily life with an emphasis on how CLA can be an empowering tool outside of academic encounters.

Al in all,Culivating Critical Language Awarenes in the Writing Clssoom is a timel contribution in today's contentious intllectual environment where identities, inguistic opression, and epistemological racism are present in so-called democratic education. The manuscript is indeed a critical adtion to the field of second language writing (L2) in general and literacy education studie, as it encourages teachers to be active agents of social transformation and justice through education. Unequivocally, Shapiro's work ads a diverse perspective to the application of CLA with a set of epistemological, practical, and pedagogical innovations. At the same time, she cleverl allowed teacher agency to blossom as sh ofered possibilities for adapting some activities that ta into students cultual and social resources. This great work suggests that it is conceivable to respect established language convention and genre rules for academic writing at the macro level while also "accommodating considerable diversity at local cales" (Canagarajah, 2022, p. 19).

However, several aspects of this work could be refined. In Section I, most of the writing activities mentioned were US based, and this may present a challenge for writing teachers outside of the US to find similar ones that are applicable in their local writing classrooms. Writing and literacy education is situated in a political and ideological space in which certain beliefs about language or other cultures are (re)produced. Hence, these types of conversations, which the author overlooked in her discussion, can engender serious systematic or institutional harm and/or backlash for some writing teachers. Questions about how teachers who are forced to stick to the national standard and stat ideology can operate under such pressure and cultivate CLA daily in their writing classroom remain challenging for many teachers globall. Future work could include an open and collective conversation about how local educational norms, writing practices, and class sze,epecially in the EF context, might hinder some of these promising applications of CLA in the writing classroom. In some areas of the world, teachers might stay on the fence, focusing on teaching writing mechanics and technique since studnts lck the asi foundations of writing as iterac practice or du to the asece f a ulture fwriting-o-lean pedagogy in both languages (Seloni & Lee, 2019). This crucial realization may aid writing and literacy teachers in determining when and where CLA can scaffold students' learning process in a more justice-oriented way and guide them to nurture more socially responsible dispositions. Al CLA advocates must be aware of these pitalls involved inCLA engagement. Teachers of writig should be aware of their epistemological privilege (Vandrick, 2009) when performing CLA as a savior, as this could create another form of unequal power relation between the rescuer and the rescued. Despite these concerns, Istrongly believe that Shapiro's textbook is a brave, transformative, and action-oriented toolkit in writig studies. It helps educators and novice researchers globally and locally discuss ways to collectively respond to any socially, politically, or linguistically discriminatory practices.
