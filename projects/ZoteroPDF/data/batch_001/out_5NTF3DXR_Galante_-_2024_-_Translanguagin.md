# ABSTRACT

The creative and dynamic practices that multilinguals perform with linguistic and non-linguistic features such as the body, movement, senses, and space have been documented as integral to their repertoire. Drawing on interdisciplinary literature, this article advances the concept of the repertoire through translanguaging drama as a pedagogical practice and examines the resources that can be volitionally mobilised through language learners’ perezhivanie, or the emotional, felt and lived through experience. Translanguaging drama was implemented in two English language programmes with adult learners in Canada. While these courses focused on improving English language skills, translanguaging drama was implemented to activate learners’ perezhivanie while using their repertoire, which not only facilitated communication in the English language but pushed for agency in using non-linguistic resources. I examine learners’ perezhivanie with a subset of data, which included observation notes and learner diary entries. In this article, I emphasize four main interrelated areas: (1) volition and empowerment, (2) meaning-making across languages, (3) embodiment of language – through voice modulation, facial expression, and body language–, and (4) language choice triggered by perezhivanie. Implications of the study for furthering the theorisation of language, language learning and the repertoire are discussed.

# Introduction

Language education is often understood as the field that studies how to teach and learn ‘languages’ in the traditional sense, mostly related to linguistic features such as morphology, phonology, semantics, syntax, and pragmatics. Research directions in the past decades, however, point toward a field that is inter/transdisciplinary (Hult 2010) and that includes examining not only the linguistic component of language but the cultural, lived (Ortega 2014), spatial (Pennycook 2017), embodied and emotional experiences of language users (Pavlenko 2006), which also embraces multi/pluriliteracies (García, Bartlett, and Kleifgen 2007; Cope, and Kalantzis 2009). These directions make us pause and rethink what we mean by language, and how we teach and learn languages.

It is worth revisiting the epistemology of language so we can build new understandings and give new meanings to what we know as ‘language’ (Barber 2003). Rapid changes impacted by social mobility and technological advancements where geographic and linguistic boundaries are more fluid than ever before (Li and Lin 2019) require constant reconceptualizations of what language means. In line with these advancements, language theories such as plurilingualism and translanguaging challenge us to break barriers between and across languages in the linguistic sense and of discrete linguistic codes of named languages (e.g. English, Mandarin, French) to reimagine ways of communication where linguistic boundaries are fluid (García and Otheguy 2019; Payant and Galante 2022). These theories problematize the exclusive reliance on one language only among multilingual users, particularly in language learning which has for decades centred a monolingual native speaker as the baseline of comparison for the language produced by multilingual speakers.

After decades of research, we can now assert that this monolingual bias is unrealistic, unproductive and irresponsible in today’s multilingual, diverse, and complex societies (Kachru 1994; May 2014; Gramling 2016; Piccardo 2017; Barros et al. 2020) where people use one or more languages and other semiotic resources for communication and to make sense of the world. Given that epistemologies of language have moved beyond linguistic features to embrace non-linguistic features such as the body and different modalities (e.g. signs, gestures, imagery) as inherent in a person’s repertoire, moving forward we need to centre our focus on how to teach and learn languages in ways that engage learners’ entire repertoires, which represent their current multilingual realities, and move away from a reductionist view of language as relying solely on its linguistic features.

One of the theories that has been revisited several times since its first emergence in the 1990s is translanguaging (Li 2018), and like other theories it will continue to evolve. In its early days, translanguaging was mainly concerned with the fluid and creative use of two languages among bilinguals (Williams 1994; Baker 2001) but it has recently moved beyond language. García and Otheguy (2019) argue that translanguaging incorporates ‘an understanding of how different modes, including our bodies, our gestures, our lives etc., add to the semiotic meaning-making repertoire that is involved in the act of communication’ (8).

The notion of the repertoire encompassing more than language is not a new one. Scholars have long called for the inclusion of other semiotic resources in the repertoire such as gestures, cultural experiences, facial expressions (Rymes 2014), multimodality, signs, embodiment of language (Block 2014; Kusters et al. 2017), creativity (Piccardo 2017; Galante 2019), and identities (Busch 2012, 2016). Several studies have documented the innovative and unique use of languages in multilinguals’ repertoires in translanguaging studies (Li 2011; Durán and Palmer 2013; De los Ríos and Seltzer 2017; Pacheco et al. 2019). More recently, an increasing body of studies have investigated non-linguistic features such as the body (Zhu, Li, and Jankowicz-Pytel 2020), space (Canagarajah 2017) and other semiotic resources (Pennycook 2017; Li and Lin 2019) as part of the repertoire. If the multilingual turn is about the lingual, we need to envision what the repertoire is in the post-multilingual turn.

In this article, I draw on the interdisciplinary literature of drama in language education, translanguaging, and the sociocultural concept of perezhivanie to introduce translanguaging drama as a pedagogical alternative to engage learners in emotional experiences that can trigger the intentional use of resources in their repertoire for expressive and communicative purposes. My goal is to not only add empirical evidence that supports the need to include non-linguistic resources in the conceptualization of the repertoire but to put forth that learners’ perezhivanie can be evoked for the volitional use of their resources. This article invites the reader to rethink the concept of language and language education, and contributes to a reconceptualization of the repertoire to include language learners’ perezhivanie in the process of language embodiment.

# Drama in language education

Drama in language education has been used for decades as an alternative to engage learners in the process of second language learning. Mimes, role-playing games, body movement exploration, voice projection, pantomime, story dramatization, improvisations, and rehearsed skits are only a few dramatic techniques that have been used to get learners engaged in learning the target language. A majority of studies in this area have examined the effects of drama on particular oral dimensions. For example, the effects of drama on second/foreign language speaking anxiety have been explored in a study that I conducted with young EFL learners in a language school in Brazil (Galante 2018), and among other student populations such as adult learners of Italian in an Australian university (Piazzoli 2011), and EFL adult learners in a Turkish university (Sağlamel and Kayaoğlu 2013). These studies show similar results: drama decreases speaking anxiety and allows learners to be more comfortable using the target language. Other studies have examined dimensions of oral communication, with results showing that learners in an EFL drama course had more gains on oral fluency and comprehensibility compared to learners in courses with traditional communicative approaches (Galante and Thomson 2017), and improved overall oral delivery (Stinson and Freebody 2006). Given that drama often requires the use of spoken language, it is no surprise that it enhances learners’ speaking skills in the target language, but what is significant in these results is that drama can be more effective compared to other approaches that are also communicative in nature. There is something about drama that enhances oral communication and it is not only the time afforded to practice the spoken language. It is also about the emotional engagement with semiotic resources beyond language, as discussed below.

# Perezhivanie and language as embodied

In drama in education, learners use language that is embodied, where sensorial and spatial dimensions of the repertoire are enacted through body movements, sounds, gestures, facial expressions, and other semiotic resources. The embodiment of language explicitly links cognition to affective dimensions, such as memories, narratives emotions, and feelings (Kramsch 2009). Rather than simply speaking a language, language learners ‘feel’ the language, which may or may not be a named language. In other words, learners can use their bodies as part of their repertoire where gestures, movements and even silence are part of language. When language learners actively embrace cognitive, affective, spatial and sensorial dimensions, learning takes place through the experience, which not only resembles real-life but can become real life (Rothwell 2011; Piccardo and Galante 2018).

Piazzoli (2018) aptly evokes Vygotsky’s (1994) concept of perezhivanie, which despite not having an equivalent English translation has been commonly referred to as the emotional, felt, and lived through experience. Perezhivanie is highly used in the dramatic arts and embraced by Stanislavski (1936 [1989]/1936 [1989]) in his acting method magic if which elicits an emotional reaction from the actor to act in the role of the character rather than simply representing the character. To emotionally experience the role, the actor asks the question, ‘What would I do if I were in this situation?’ Most trained actors, including myself, have studied this method at least in the beginning of their acting training to connect to the realities of their character and embody the character’s emotions, which become the actor’s own, and is ultimately manifested through the use of linguistic and non-linguistic resources during performance. Language in the dramatic sense is, therefore, embodied, experienced, felt, and lived. Many dramatic exercises used in acting training purposefully exclude the use of language in the traditional sense (e.g. a named language) to exploit non-language when expressing emotions: ‘speaking’ gibberish, reacting to objects, and using space and movement, are only a few examples.

The contributions of Vygotsky’s work in understandings of thinking (cognition) as inseparable from emotions paved the way for embracing complexity in educational theories. In ‘The Psychology of Art’ and other of his final works, Vygotsky focused on the interrelation of concepts such as perezhivanie, emotion and imagination but definitions of perezhivanie remained unclear and vague (Fleer, González Rey, and Veresov 2017 ; González Rey 2016), which open venues for further explorations. As an attempt to unpack the meanings of perezhivanie, Veresov (2016) draws on the works of Vygotsky where the term was originally introduced in different ways: one in which it refers to how someone can emotionally relate to a certain experience and another in which it is a concept used to study the role of the environment on someone’s psychological development. For the author, perezhivanie can be defined as the ‘observable phenomena that can be captured and collected as experimental or empirical data’ or the phenomenological psychological processes and experiences (ontology) and as ‘a concept, which is an analytical tool; a theoretical lens of the analysis of the role and influence of social reality on the course of a child’s development’ (epistemology) (130). Perezhivanie is not only the emotional experience or the emotions someone has as a result of the environment. It is $\mathbf { \check { a } }$ complex nexus of psychological processes that includes emotions, cognitive processes, memory and even volition’ (Veresov 2016, 130). In language education, perezhivanie connects cognition– emotion as one single dialectical unit during the language learning process rather than two separate dimensions (Poehner and Swain 2017; Lantolf and Swain 2019). In this article, I put forth the term translanguaging drama to evoke language learners’ perezhivanie in the ontological sense. Through translanguaging drama, learners do not only use their repertoire of semiotic resources, but these resources are volitionally used when lived through experiences that evoke emotions, as I explain below.

# Translanguaging drama

I conceive the term translanguaging drama to differentiate it from how drama has been used in language learning, which has primarily relied on the use of the target (named) language of instruction. I define translanguaging drama as the process of evoking learners’ perezhivanie as the emotional, felt and lived through experience during a performance which can be manifested in communication through the fluid and intentional use of semiotic resources (linguistic and non-linguistic). Through the dramatic experience, the learning process embraces ‘mind, body emotions, imagination and memories’ which can facilitate deep learning (Haseman and O’Toole 2017, 8). Rather than an improvised performance where learners construct and enact a story in which they simply represent a character, in translanguaging drama learners enact a story that may or may not be imagined but one that evokes an emotional reaction, becoming their own lived experience. That is, they enter the dramatic experience with the ‘magic if’ question ‘What would I do if I were in this situation?,’ embodying the emotional experiences required by the situation posed, which provokes the use of resources for self-expression and communication.

The linguistic dimension includes any named language in learners’ repertoire. If learners are speakers of Mandarin, English, and are now learning Spanish, it is not only the target language Spanish that will be used; it is the entire linguistic repertoire. Moreover, the learner will draw on non-linguistic resources which includes the body, gestures, sense, facial expressions, silence, props, the space or any objects to be used in the enactment of the dramatic experience.

In translanguaging drama, the repertoire is embodied, felt, experienced and emoted. Learners are propelled into situations where they have to reflect on who they are in a given situation, or on their multiple selves and their relationship with others and the space. They can play an identity of which they are already aware or explore a new one. Participants in translanguaging drama work collaboratively to accomplish a goal in which ideas, movements, and actions are negotiated. This negotiation often takes place in the preparation phase of a scene, which may take a few minutes before its enactment and can continue during the scene in an improvised manner, or even changed if necessary or wanted. Because learners may use any language in their repertoire, they may not be able to understand the language of their peers, placing importance to non-linguistic resources such as tone, emotion, intention, volume, facial expression, and the movements of the body in relation to the space for meaning-making.

Using perezhivanie as observable phenomena (Veresov 2016), I used previously collected data of adult language learners to examine how they engaged in their repertoire through translanguaging drama in two English language programmes. In Case Study 1, while I was the instructor of an English as a Second Language (ESL) course I conducted observations and took notes of my students’ group discussions during the preparation phase and their performance of the translanguaging drama in front of the class (Galante 2014). In Case Study 2, I conducted classroom observations in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) class taught by an experienced EAP instructor and collected student diary entries of their impressions of one particular class where they performed translanguaging drama (Galante et al. 2020). In both case studies, I focused on one particular class where students used translanguaging drama so I could focus on the transformational power of the pedagogical practice. The four phenomena observed are presented in Figure 1.

Below, while I present these phenomena as distinct to highlight their uniqueness, they should be seen as interrelated. The reader may notice that each phenomenon was not exclusive to one case study or another. For example, the embodiment of language can be observed in both case studies.

# Case study 1

In a Canadian college where adult international students were enrolled in an ESL course as preparation for joining their college programme, I used translanguaging drama in a Speaking course with students who had upper-intermediate levels of English (equivalent to CEFR B2). I was the instructor of the course and in my class, there were 20 students from different countries and who spoke different languages: Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, French, and Russian. All of the students had an international status and had recently arrived in Canada. The translanguaging drama was based on their current experiences and struggles to adapt to new environments: the college, their homestay family, the new educational experiences, the weather, etc. One recurrent topic reported in class was conflicting situations with students’ homestay families who had rules, customs and beliefs that made students feel like misfits. The translanguaging drama resulted in a digital project about intercultural sensitivity in which English vocabulary was the main language learning goal, but in this article, I focus on perezhivanie as a phenomenon that mobilised linguistic and non-linguistic communicative resources.

# Volition and empowerment

In class, students were placed into small groups of four or five and asked to share experiences when being misunderstood or their frustrations in adapting to the new environment. After the members of the group shared their own stories, they were asked to choose one to enact. In one of the groups, they chose Paul’s (pseudonym) story and looked for a possible solution to his conflicting situation. Paul, an adult Korean student, shared his story with the group. At the time, he was living with a homestay family of White Canadians in Ontario, Canada. As part of his cultural tradition and eating habits, Paul enjoyed cooking kimchi and other types of Korean food but reported that his homestay family did not allow him to cook Korean food because they claimed that part of the homestay experience included eating Canadian meals prepared by the family. The meals were also included in the homestay package, which Paul had already paid for. One day, while his homestay family was out, Paul decided to quickly fix himself some Korean food but when the family arrived, they told him his food ‘stank.’ Paul’s eyes filled with tears as he was telling his story, which was told in English and in Korean whenever he felt he needed to access his emotions.

Figure 1. Four phenomena of translanguaging drama.

During the translanguaging drama, the students in the group embodied different characters but Paul wished to play himself. The story and the conflict resolution were created by the group: during the preparation, students were invested in their emotions as they empathised with Paul’s story and wished to find a possible solution for Paul but which could also be for themselves should they encounter a similar situation.

The translanguaging drama started with a scene with Paul eating kimchi at the dinner table, alone in the house, when the homestay family – father, mother, and sister – suddenly arrived. The homestay family was shocked to see Paul eating kimchi, especially after having explained the rules of the house, and reprimanded him. At first, Paul put his head down and listened, then explained that for him food was not only nourishment but was directly related to his identity as a Korean. He explained that being deprived from eating his food was like having his identity stripped away from him. The family members insisted that Paul ate their food. At this moment, Paul rebelled and stood up for his right of eating what he wanted to. He stormed out, locked himself in his room and called a friend, who advised him to move to another house.

I noted that students’ perezhivanie were manifested in the enactment of the scene through the fluid and intentional use of the following non-linguistic resources:

Objects: Paul used a classroom desk as a dining table and pencils as chopsticks.

Senses and facial expression: a family member smelled the environment and frowned to represent that something smelled bad.

Gestures: the mother pointed fingers at Paul’s face to reprimand his action of cooking Korean food.

Body language: the father was standing with a straight posture to show power while Paul was sitting with his head down.

Space: Paul was at one end of the classroom while his homestay family members were at the opposing end to indicate divisiveness.

Body movement: Paul stood up to be at the same height level as his homestay father to indicate empowerment.

Voice modulation: the father spoke loud and in low voice to indicate power.

These resources, when used with the target language (English) can not only enhance communication but allow students to express themselves and act according to their perezhevanie, which can be a transformative learning experience.

The group members enacted the scene with the conflict resolution of Paul leaving his homestay family. The enactment was cathartic and emotionally charged, and the translanguaging drama allowed students to experience an array of emotions; for example, while reporting feelings of marginalization in his homestay family situation, Paul experienced some negative emotions (as evidenced by teary eyes), but he also experienced positive emotions during the enactment of the drama (as evidenced by a smile when peers showed support). More importantly, the transformational power of the dramatic experience may have informed real-life actions. In the case of Paul, a week after the translanguaging drama, he reported having made a request with the college’s International Department for a new homestay family. It is impossible to know with certainty whether this action was a result of the translanguaging drama, but it may have afforded Paul with emotional empowerment through his perezhevanie and experimenting a different dimension of his ‘self’ with actions he may have never taken otherwise.

# Case study 2

In a Canadian university where adult international students were enrolled in an English for Academic Purposes programme, one instructor used translanguaging drama with 12 students who had upperintermediate levels of English (equivalent to CEFR B2) as part of a study that had a plurilingual pedagogical intervention in a Listening and Speaking course (Galante et al. 2020). The instructor used translanguaging drama once as part of other activities that made up the intervention of the study. The translanguaging drama was embedded in a three-hour class where the instructor introduced English idioms and students were required to deliver a classroom performance in which they would make use of all the languages in their repertoire and other semiotic resources to help make meaning of idioms. Drawing on their perezhivanie, students recalled or imagined situations related to the academic experience in the university. One of the situations presented was:

You are in a university class discussing a topic with your colleagues. There will be some disagreement and at least two of you will have conflicting opinions about the topic. You will have a few minutes to prepare your scene. Ensure to include idioms you have learned in class today. Use any language the situation requires during your scene but ensure to use your body and other resources to represent the meaning so the audience can understand.

In this class, most of the students were from China. In one of the groups, there were four students: one who spoke Russian as an L1, one who spoke Taiwanese as an L1, and two students who spoke Mandarin as an L1. Despite their L1 and English (the target language), some students had additional languages in their repertoire. Because of the composition of the class, the student audience may or may not have understood the languages spoken during the performance as they may or may not have shared the languages spoken; but it was made clear to students that they could mobilise other (non-linguistic) resources to convey meaning. While there were no other speakers of Russian or Taiwanese in the class, these languages were still used during the performance and the students in the audience were required to figure out the message by looking at non-linguistic resources: body language, facial expression, tone of voice, body movement, space, etc. One of the goals of the translanguaging drama was to allow students’ to evoke their perezhivanie, which could be manifested in different ways. As part of the data analysis, I chose observational data from one class and I also gathered students’ overall impression of the translaguaging drama through their diary entries. I examined the extent to which students’ perezhivanie was manifested through translanguaging drama. Below is a description of one translanguaging drama performed in one class, followed by students’ overall impressions.

A group of four students performed a scene with different characters: a professor, enacted by a student who spoke Spanish as an L1, and three undergraduate students who played themselves and who spoke Mandarin as an L1. The situation revolved around one of the students who had not collaborated in a group presentation, causing some conflict in the group. Two students who were working collaboratively decided to visit the professor during his office hours to ask for advice. The conversation began in English and suddenly stopped because the professor’s phone rang (the ringing sound was made by a student in the audience). The professor moved his arms, picked up an imaginary phone, and switched to Spanish to discuss a family matter. While he spoke in Spanish, he varied pitch, tone and volume, and had his eyes wide open to indicate surprise. When he put the imaginary receiver down, he looked at the two students and, in English, apologised for having to take the call, but said it had been an urgent family matter. The two students continued the conversation in English and told the professor about the conflict in their group. The professor suggested that the students tried to resolve the situation without his intervention. The two students thanked the professor, stood up and left the office by closing an imaginary door. They walked to the other side of the room where their friend was sitting by herself in the cafeteria. She greeted them by saying, ‘Have you eaten yet?’ in Mandarin. The two students sat down and chatted for a while, when a server (played by an audience member) brought some food to the table. With her hands, she indicated she wanted to share the food with her friends, who used body language to eat, using chopsticks and slurping soup from a bowl. As an attempt to resolve the conflict, one of the students started a conversation in Mandarin to first show his dissatisfaction with his colleague’s lack of collaboration in the group presentation. He showed this dissatisfaction by looking at her in an angry manner and raising his voice while she just listened and kept offering food. The food savouring was indicated by facial expression (closing their eyes with a smile) and voicing ‘hmmmm.’ After a few minutes, they switched to English to discuss details of their academic assignment. The scene ended with the two members agreeing to give their friend a second chance to collaborate in their academic project.

This example shows how students used different linguistic codes (Spanish, Mandarin and English) as well as creatively merging cultural traditions related to one language (Mandarin) but manifested in another language (English) with the expression ‘Have you eaten yet?’ which is a common way to greet others in mainstream Chinese culture. Moreover, sharing food is another cultural tradition and was used in their scene as a point of openness for dialogues. Following the translanguaging drama performed in class, students were asked their overall impression of the tasks completed in class, including the use of languages other than English in the task. They were asked to write a one-paragraph diary entry. I present the most recurrent themes related to the drama based on students’ accounts.

# Meaning-making across languages

In their diaries, several students reported that translanguaging in the linguistic sense of fluidly moving from one language to another and creatively using their languages was a normal behaviour, even in academic settings where English is the language of instruction, and often necessary for meaning-making as translation equivalents may not capture the right meaning. One participant stated:

Today, we did a code-switching role-play. And I found most of them are normal in my daily life. I often use mix language with my classmate and even family. Sometimes, it is hard to use only one language for me … There is some word cannot replace by other language. It is normal for us to use different language to deliver our meaning, especially in school.

Rather than being concerned that some of their peers may not understand the language spoken in their performance, students reported having enjoyed the experience. They also noted that because translanguaging is a natural linguistic behaviour among all students in class and that the only difference among them was the linguistic codes used. They felt comfortable and even proud, as rightly captured by one student:

I remembered that I practice the task with a girl who speak Cantonese as her first language. She tried to communicate with me by using Cantonese, and I replied her by using Taiwanese. I am the only Taiwanese speaker in the class. Nobody knew Taiwanese but they can understand what I am trying to say. It makes me feel proud. It was a fun task, because I have chance to introduce Taiwanese to my other classmates.

This quote indicates that despite the use of languages that were not shared with all students, meaning was not lost during the performance because it was embodied, as discussed in the next section.

# Embodying language

Besides communicating across languages, students made use of non-linguistic features as previously noted. In their diaries, they highlighted four most noticeable ones, or at least four that were

recognised as features in their repertoire: voice modulation, facial expression, body language, and expressing emotions.

# Voice modulation

While the students had no acting training, they modulated their voice by changing the volume, tone, speed, pitch, and intention. This modulation was situational and was accompanied by body movement, facial expressions, emotions and use of space and objects. That is, voice modulation was a non-linguistic component of the students’ repertoire that was manifested through their perezhivanie; it was a mechanism to both express and comprehend a given message. Moreover, because the performance required that learners used the languages in their repertoire, I observed that they used the body with more prominence when English was not the language used as a way to ensure the message was communicated to the audience non-linguistically. One student that had Mandarin as an L1 reported that it was through his peer’s voice modulation when speaking in Turkish that he was able to understand the message. He noted, ‘I really love this performance. It’s really interesting that I can guess what they talk about when they use their first language by their voice.’ Another student was more specific and highlighted the tone of voice as a feature for comprehension, ‘It is easier for others to understand what they say in different languages because of their speaking tone.’ Again, it was through their perezhivanie that students accessed resources such as voice modulation to make meaning: the audience was able to understand that the students performing were being humorous, serious, formal or casual because of how they modulated their voice. Moreover, the tone could also refer to the tonal features of some languages (e.g. Mandarin) which is sometimes the only element used to distinguish one word from another.

# Facial expression and body language

During the performance, students made use of several features of their body: eyes wide open to express surprise, smiling while savouring food, and crossing their arms in front of their body to indicate disapproval, among others. Through the use of body language and facial expressions when using a language other than English, students showed awareness that their audience members would probably rely on their body to understand the drama. One student argued that a language, when embodied, can have meaning that go beyond words, is relational and dependent on the interlocutor’s emotional and physical reactions:

I learned some communication styles such as eye contact or body language. I always adjust my communication styles by the observation of the body of the speaker, because I can show my respect to him.

During the planning phase of the translanguaging drama, I observed that the students were focused on the premise of the story, what their roles were and what would happen during the enactment of the scene. They did not, however, plan exactly what they were going to say, what language they were going to use or how they would use their body. It was the spontaneous performative experience and the their relational and situational experience that required certain body language. In short, the experience was felt and the body responded to it.

# Language choice triggered by perezhivanie

While students were free to experiment with the languages in their repertoire, the language choice was triggered by the emotional experience during the performance. In some performances, two students were using two languages that were not shared among themselves, for example, Mandarin and Spanish. While they may not have understood their peer’s language, they were familiar with the topic of the scene as discussed in the planning phase. During the performance, however, they could choose what language to use depending on the emotion experienced. One student explained the choice of language as based on his emotion, ‘When you are angry you can use your own language to illustrate your idea directly and speak with more influence.’ Similarly, other students chose a language because certain emotions were better expressed in that language compared to another. For example, one student noted, ‘I prefer to switch when I want to say Chinese poems or idioms which may loose the original feelings.’ Several students who had Mandarin as an L1 indicated preference for Mandarin when using metaphors or proverbs as they feel the meaning is highly connected to cultural understandings and if translated into English the meaning could be lost. Another student expanded on this cultural dimension of languages and the choice of one language over another one for expressing emotions:

Languages stand for culture, some words may be hard to be explained in their own language, I think that is why we need to change of dialect. It is necessary and it can show our feeling better.

For these multilingual students, the emotion that they wished to convey triggered the choice of different languages in their repertoire. For them, the fluid use of these languages was intentional rather than simply playful. They were emotionally invested and cognitively aware of the communicative goals of their drama. Thus, the cognition–emotion unit, which is central to perezhevanie, was apparent in their accounts. Moreover, they exhibited awareness that the same sound produced by their bodies could spark different emotional reactions depending on the language used, as noted by one student, ‘For example, when you say “hehe” in Chinese, it means that you are sneering at someone instead of the meaning of smiling or laughing in English.’

# Discussion and conclusion

In this article, I highlighted the importance of revisiting what we mean by language in the post-multilingual turn in language education. While the field has heavily relied on linguistic features of languages, recent social developments where boundaries across languages among multilinguals and geographical locations become more fluid, there is an urgent need to reconceptualize how we communicate. Recent language theories such as translanguaging have rightly recognised the importance of non-linguistic features (García and Otheguy 2019) and several calls for integrating non-linguistic resources in the concept of the repertoire have been made in language education (Busch 2012; Block 2014; Rymes 2014; Busch 2016; Kusters et al., 2017).

Drawing on transdisciplinary research on drama in language education (Haseman and O’Toole 2017; Piazzoli 2018) and the sociocultural concept of perezhivanie (Poehner and Swain 2017; Veresov 2017; Lantolf and Swain 2019), this article illustrated through two case studies how translanguaging drama can evoke learners’ perezhevanie for volitional use of the resources in their repertoire. This article provided empirical evidence of the phenomenon of perezhivanie and how it was manifested in two English language programmes. It included both my observations and students’ voices to illustrate how translanguaging drama engaged them in mobilising several resources, which many times combined language with other semiotic resources for volitional meaning-making.

While the two case studies discussed in this article clearly show how through translanguaging drama students engaged with a repertoire that goes beyond language, the reader may ask how it is relevant for language learning pedagogy. Translanguaging drama can be used in the language classroom to afford learners opportunities to experiment with resources which they have never even imagined they had. For example, depending on the emotion being experienced, they can use voice modulation for intentional communication. Voice modulation may enhance communication, and in the case of oral language intelligibility from the part of the listener (e.g. audience member). The students reported that the use of resources other than linguistic, when expressed through an emotional experience, can facilitate communication. This is key for language learning, particularly as students can explore resources in their repertoire that go beyond language to creatively and volitionally convey their message. In this article, the analysis of translanguaging drama shows that students manifested their perezhivanie through the use of different named languages, spatial and sensorial dimensions, objects, embodiment (voice modulation, facial expression, body language, body movement), and language choice. These resources are not limited to this list and could be expanded depending on the student population, context, creativity, and situational and relational experiences. For example, visuals, drawings, dance, music and sound could also be manifested. Moreover, if the translanguaging drama is enacted and video recorded, the editing could include digital resources such as music and effects.

With the aforementioned implications, I hope to contribute to advancing the conceptualization of the repertoire to not only include linguistic and non-linguistic resources, but to allow these resources to be manifested by living through the emotional experiences that make the use of resources volitional. Moving forward, multilingual learners’ perezhivanie need to take centre stage in language education research if the focus is on empowerment and agency of when and how they want to use their resources. Translanguaging drama is a unique venue to evoke learners’ emotional experiences in the fluid use of language and other resources for volitional communication that can transform language learning and use.
