# ABSTRACT

Alumni-student mentoring programs have become commonplace at many universities, and yet, scholarly research has rarely explored the impact of these programs on participating students and alumni. To address this, we investigated three alumni mentoring programs at a large research-intensive university in Australia. Using a mixed methods approach (a web based survey and interviews), we sought both students' and mentors' perceptions of their alumni mentoring program and how their involvement may have impacted their perceptions of the university $\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 1 9 7 )$ . The findings highlight that alumni mentoring programs provide distinct benefits to both students and alumni and may result in improved university engagement. Our results also indicate new revelations about alumni mentoring programs, including the challenges associated with mentoring postgraduate students and recommended best practice to ensure the success of alumni mentoring programs.

# Introduction

There is growing literature in higher education that discusses the potential benefits of integrating alumni more closely within the university community. These benefits include access to resources through philanthropy or industry collaboration, marketing and promotion of the university, and alumni’s potential to help students to support graduate employability (Ebert, Axelsson, & Harbor, 2015; Heckman & Guskey, 1998; Pearson, 1999). Especially of interest to this article, numerous scholars have noted that alumni are increasingly key stakeholders and can potentially offer a wide variety of value to students’ employability (Helgesen & Nesset, 2007; Nguyen & LeBlanc, 2001).

In order to explore this potential value, this article discusses the experiences of students and mentors in three alumni mentoring programs. While the bulk of alumnirelated research has occurred in the US context (e.g., Bastedo, Samuels, & Kleinman, 2014; Unangst, 2018) this study took place in Australia, where there has been growing interest in alumni engagement, including by the Australian government (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [DFAT], 2016) and yet less scholarly research has occurred. The aims of the study were to explore the experiences and motivations of students and alumni mentors across three distinct alumni mentoring programs, as well as to explore how students’ participation in the program impacted their perceptions of the university and/or their student experience. The three research questions guiding the study included:

(1) To what extent does participation in alumni programs influence students’ perception of graduate employability and/or students’ subsequent career outcomes?   
(2) How does participation in alumni programs impact students’ overall student experience?   
(3) To what extent does participation in alumni program impact alumni perceptions of their perceptions of the university and impact their future behaviour to engage with the university?

Through the analysis below, findings will add several key contributions to the existing literature, including how participation for students and alumni may impact their perception of the university and the specific challenges that may arise for supporting postgraduate students in alumni mentoring programs. This article then provides a series of recommendations, based on empirical findings, to support the development of alumni mentoring programs both in and outside of Australia.

# Background to alumni mentoring programs

Mentorship has very broadly been defined as a strategy where a more experienced person assists, supports or encourages a less experienced person or group of people (e.g., in Elliott, Beltman, & Lynch, 2011, July). While an array of mentoring programs exists within higher education, including academic-student and peer-to-peer programs, alumni-specific mentoring programs have received less scholarly attention and/or evaluation with only a few studies to date (e.g., Pfeifer, 2002; Renuga & Ezhilan, 2014). Crisp and Cruz (2009) write that while some mentoring programs on campus may have a foundation in developmental psychology, alumni mentoring programs are often instead aimed at connecting students with business and industry, often to improve students’ confidence in finding work, or understanding which career path they may want to pursue. As there has been growing literature on the importance of graduate employability within higher education (Clarke, 2018), it is expected that universities will continue to focus on alumni mentoring programs as a mechanism to support students’ pathways into future work.

Within alumni mentoring programs, there are two distinct streams that are aimed at different audiences. One stream is aimed at helping disadvantaged groups, such as first-in-family, and/or students who may be on particular equity-related scholarships (e.g., Boardman, 2003; Colvin & Jaffar, 2007). Delvin et al. (2012) write that across institutional efforts to engage with disadvantaged students, peer mentoring programs have become ‘a key institutional strategy’ (p. 45). The second stream of alumni mentoring programs, and also an increasingly key institutional strategy, is to connect highly engaged/high achieving students with industry partners. These programs often include an application process and have the additional bonus of connecting highly talented students with affiliated business and/or organisations. Yet despite growth in both types of alumni mentoring programs, and heightened institutional marketing related to programs, alumni mentoring remains an under-researched area (Crisp & Cruz, 2009; Lunsford, 2011).

The findings that do exist on alumni mentoring programs have been largely positive, particularly for student outcomes. Studies, for example, have found that student participants in professional/alumni mentoring programs are more likely to graduate with a job and have higher levels of satisfaction of their university experience than students who did not participate (Crisp, Nora, & Taggart, 2009; Murphy & Ensher, 2001; Orpen, 1995; Tenenbaum, Crosby, & Gliner, 2001). Studies exploring the outcomes of mentoring in university settings show that students believed mentoring programs were worth the time and had benefits such as providing students with a better picture of life after graduation (Schlee, 2000). Mentoring at university has also been linked to retention (e.g., Noonan, Bullen, & Farruggia, 2012; Phinney, Campos, Cidhinnia, Padilla Kallemeyn, & Kim, 2011). Similarly, D’Abate (2010) found in a study with business students and alumni that students who were mentored reported higher levels of psychosocial support. D’Abate’s study further related to other mentoring research that distinguished between how benefits of mentoring could unfold over time, as he found that some students did not see the full benefits of mentoring until 3–5 years had passed.

It is not only student retention, student graduate employability and student experience that may be linked to mentoring programs. Increasingly, higher education is also interested in understanding the precursors and the impact of mentoring on the mentors themselves, as alumni have been shown to be beneficial as sources of information and financial support for the university and its students (Volkwein, 2010; Weerts & Ronca, 2007). For example, graduates with high levels of financial resources have been shown to be more likely to donate funds (Hoyt, 2004). Mosser (1993) additionally found a relationship between the number of degrees and alumni support. Other factors that research have sought to link to alumni engagement behaviour have included: student governance, community engagement, multicultural activities, financial aid, quality of instruction, enhanced abilities, satisfaction, perceived impact, overall evaluation and willingness to enrol again (Volkwein, 2010). A student’s satisfaction with their learning experience also effects their likelihood of giving financially to the university, supporting the concept that alumni engagement and student experience are interrelated (Pearson, 1999).

While there is a link between student experience and alumni engagement, how the quality of the student experience may impact future alumni engagement, is a question still being explored. This background review of alumni mentoring programs has also highlighted that there are potential benefits of investing and supporting alumni mentoring programs within higher education, and that the benefits would serve the students, the alumni, and the university community. It further suggests that there is a specific benefit in investigating how such programs may best encourage both student outcomes and alumni engagement.

# The study

To further investigate this, the study discussed in this article aimed to holistically understand both students’ and mentors’ perceptions across three unique programs. By doing so, the study was uniquely positioned to compare both the findings from

previous literature and differences across three distinct programs, to explore the three central research questions.

# Study design

The study used a mixed-methods approach which included two phases. The first phase was a web-based survey which included a combination of closed-choice and openended response questions. At the end of the survey, all participants were asked to leave an email address or phone number if they wished to also participate in an interview. The interview phase (second phase) included a $3 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ follow-up interview with participants who elected to volunteer their time. This combination of methods added depth to the quality of the data and included as many perspectives as possible (Creswell & Creswell, 2005; Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989). The first phase of the study began in March 2018 and was distributed to all potential participants.

The collected data from the survey were analysed in conjunction with the data collected from interviews to ascertain how themes may arise in both data sets (Creswell, Plano Clark, Gutmann, & Hanson, 2003). We used Bazeley’s three-step approach of ‘describe, compare, relate’ (Bazeley, 2009, p. 10) to analyse the data. All data collection methods for this study were approved by the university’s ethical review committee and were consistent with the terms of ethical approval.

# Overview of three alumni mentoring programs

The study drew on three separate alumni mentoring programs all situated at a large research-intensive university in Australia. One of the three programs was managed centrally through an office for student equity and was offered to all undergraduate students who had received a specific equity scholarship regardless of discipline. It is referred to in this article as the ‘Access’ program. The second program (‘Business’) was also geared towards undergraduate students but was located in a business faculty and students were required to apply to enter the mentoring program. Students from this program were typically in the second or third year of their degree and, as places were limited, students were selected based on the prior academic achievement as well a written statement of interest. The third program was the only program included in this study for masters’ students and was located in the law faculty (‘Law’). Similar to the program in the business faculty, students needed to apply to be accepted to this program with the process considered both prior academic achievement and a written statement. This highlights a significant point of difference within the programs, as two of the three programs required a student application process. However, it should be noted that all three programs were offered to typically high-achieving students, as students in the Access program had received a prestigious scholarship.

All mentoring programs included within the study were aimed at improving graduate employability and tried to match students with mentors who currently worked in students’ desired careers. However, findings indicated that often students’ desired career path and mentors’ careers did not always align. While all three programs were managed by different professional staff, the programs shared many commonalities. For example, all mentors received pamphlets and guiding materials on what their roles in the program would be and how to lead mentoring meetings (e.g., sample questions to ask). Students were also invited to pre-training sessions where they were given advice on how to contact mentors and voice concerns or questions. It was expected in all three programs for mentors and mentees to meet twice during the semester, using an online video chat program if someone was abroad. However, more meetings were encouraged if the mentor/mentee decided to pursue this option.

# Participant sample

The study took place at a large research-intensive university in Australia. A total of 197 participants took part in the study, with 134 participants (68 per cent) identifying as mentors and 62 participants (32 per cent) identifying as students (See Table 1-2). However, not all participants responded to every question; therefore, the total number of participants for each question varies. Participants were recruited through three different alumni mentoring programs: one in the business faculty $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } = 7 9$ , 40 per cent), one in the law school ${ \mathrm { ( n } } = 6 5 { \mathrm { ) } }$ , 33 per cent), and one program that connected students on an equity and diversity-related scholarship $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 5 3$ , 27 per cent). Potential participants were those who completed the program in either Semester 1 or Semester 2 of 2017, as all three programs were only one semester in duration. All potential participants were emailed an invitation to participate as well as a reminder two weeks later.

Note: The ‘Total’ column refers to the total number of respondents, not the total number of participants.

Gender was approximately even across the groups (56 per cent male, 43 per cent female). As expected, age between the two groups varied, with 91 per cent of students identifying as under 29 years old, but 70 per cent of mentors identifying as 40 or older. Mentor participants were asked how long they had served as a mentor, with 30 mentors (23 per cent) indicating over 5 years, 79 mentors (61 per cent) indicating between 1 and 5 years, and the remaining 21 mentors (15 per cent) indicating less than one year. Also, many mentors identified as having attended the same university themselves (82 per cent), however, not all, as the alumni programs also allowed for graduates of other universities to serve as mentors.

Mentee participants were asked to indicate if they were international students or Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. A total of 15 student participants $\left( \mathbf { n } \ = \ 1 5 \right)$ identified as international and a total of 3 student participants identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Additionally, 46 students (27 per cent) identified as first-in-family to attend a university.

# Findings

The next section provides an overview of the major findings or themes to emerge from the study, evidencing with data either from the survey and/or interviews. When it is critical to note differences between programs, this will be done, for example, in findings related to challenges for postgraduate students. Relevant sections also compare students’ versus mentors’ perceptions, for example, in the theme ‘motivations for participation’. The following sections highlight findings based on four key areas: participants’ motivations; students’ perceptions of employability; impact on the students’ university experience; and furthering alumni engagement with the university.

# Motivations for participation

Students and alumni mentors were both asked about their motivations to participate in alumni mentoring programs, and findings suggest that the two groups often had different objectives. While mentors seemed to focus on the more feel-good benefits, students were more interested in specific, career-boosting possibilities.

Specifically, mentors across all three programs indicated similar results through the web-based survey. The majority of mentors $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = \mathbf { \tilde { \rho } } _ { 1 0 2 }$ , 78 per cent) indicated they wanted to help students in need of career support while 78 of the 130 mentors (60 per cent) indicated they wanted to give back to the University. Other responses included that they wanted to learn about younger generations of workers $\left( \mathtt { n } \ \right) = \ 3 5$ , 27 per cent), wanted to make connections with students and other mentors $[ \mathfrak { n } = 2 8$ , 22 per cent) and received similar assistance or were part of a mentoring program when they were a student $\mathbf { \tilde { n } = 1 1 }$ , 8 per cent).

Through open-ended responses, mentors were able to offer more detailed responses on why they had decided to participate in the program. A total of 24 mentors wrote a personal response, and comments about helping others and supporting younger generations were some of the main themes to emerge. A few mentors noted that they wanted to serve as a mentor because they did not have the opportunity themselves when they were a student. Quotes included:

‘I am passionate about this age range, being able to see them come out the other side.’ -Mentor, Access

‘When I see my mentees get the jobs they want it’s really great.’ – Mentor, Business ‘I want to give back to society. And it’s part of my social corporate responsibility. You can look in my LinkedIn profile to see the comments from my mentees.’ – Mentor, Business

Then, when students were asked about their motivations and expectations of the alumni mentoring programs, the majority of students indicated that they participated in the program to increase their career skills or industry knowledge. Frequently, students also noted that they hoped they would build a professional relationship with their mentor. A few students also mentioned that their expectations included Australian-specific knowledge, networking more broadly or that they were unsure what to expect.

For example, in the selection of quotes below it can be seen that students wanted to learn about their mentor’s industry and specific company in order to have greater insight into how to apply for jobs in the future. Students hoped that mentors would give advice or tips on how to apply for jobs and build their careers. International student mentees also often mentioned that they wanted Western/Australian-specific tips on applying for jobs or industry knowledge, as they believed the process would be different in Australia than in their home countries. A few other students mentioned that they did not know what to expect but signed up for the program because it looked interesting.

‘I wanted industry experience and learn more about the profession. And help me decide where I should go with my own career.’ – Mentee, Law

‘I really needed someone who could open me a door, because my family couldn’t.’ - Mentee, Access

Thus, in comparing students’ and mentors’ responses, findings revealed a slight mismatch between mentors and students’ motivations for participation. Mentors mentioned a more general desire to help prepare future generations, while students often had more instrumental expectations, such as gaining access to important professional networks. It further became clear through comments made in interviews that mentors were more interested in the larger picture of mentoring (i.e., sharing stories or helping build young people’s confidence), while mentees themselves needed more instrumental and specific help (i.e., personal letters of recommendation and specific career guidance).

To further illustrate, many mentees who were interviewed were highly engaged students who had part-time jobs or had previously done internships. As one Access mentee noted, ‘I had already done an internship, but was looking for insider information. Generally, students are concerned about future jobs’. However, many mentors in the interviews believed the mentoring program was about giving students broad advice on their future career, not only helping them gain employment. When mentors were asked to tell a specific story of guidance or advice they had given a mentee that they believed really helped the mentee, many struggled to respond. Instead, mentors often referred to the general information they had conveyed. For example, one Business mentor responded, ‘I help my mentees by equipping them with life skills, so they can be street smart. Not career skills. You know I tell them to focus on human values, like honesty and how to deal with disappointment’.

# Students’ perceptions on employability

A key aim of all three programs drawn on for the study was to improve students’ perceptions of their own future employability. Aligning to this, the study explored the impact of the program across employability, student confidence, and self-efficacy. Initial analysis found that student participants responded positively in each of these areas. For example, a total of 39 students (79 per cent) indicated they agreed or strongly agreed that they were able to discuss their personal skill sets. Likewise, a total of 35 students (71 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed with the statements, ‘I am confident about finding work in the future’ and ‘I feel comfortable networking with professionals.’

Table 3. Student perceptions of employability.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>As a result, in my participation in the alumni mentoring program..</td><td>Strongly Disagree</td><td>Disagree</td><td></td><td>Neither agree nor disagree</td><td>Agree</td><td></td><td>Strongly agree</td><td></td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>I am confident about finding work in the future</td><td>4.08%</td><td>2</td><td>8.16%</td><td>4</td><td>16.33%</td><td>8 38.78%</td><td>19</td><td>32.65%</td><td>16 49</td></tr><tr><td>I am able to discuss my personal skill sets</td><td>6.12%</td><td>3</td><td>0.00% 0</td><td>14.29%</td><td></td><td>7 48.98% 24</td><td>30.61%</td><td>15</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>I have a clear vision towards future career paths</td><td>6.12%</td><td>3</td><td>12.24% 6</td><td>16.33%</td><td></td><td>8 38.78% 19</td><td>26.53%</td><td>13</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>I feel comfortable networking with professionals</td><td>6.12%</td><td>3</td><td>12.24% 6</td><td>10.20%</td><td></td><td>5 38.78% 19</td><td>32.65%</td><td>16</td><td>49</td></tr></table></body></html>

However, not all students agreed with these statements, and further analysis revealed that the program of participation may have made a difference in students’ response to these statements. Most notably, the majority of students who strongly disagree or disagreed about the employability aspects of the alumni mentoring program were from the law program specifically. For example, 4 out of 21 law students strongly disagreed or disagreed that they were confident about finding work in the future, and five law students strongly disagreed or disagreed that they have a clear vision towards future career paths. This may be linked to the law course being as postgraduate course, rather than an undergraduate course. Further, while overall the percentage of students who did not perceive a positive benefit from the alumni mentoring programs in regard to their employability was relatively small, these students still reflect a critical population that is not currently seeing benefits in the programs. It also supports the idea that differences between programs exist, as do the needs of their participants (See Table 3).

# Perception of impact on university experience

It also seemed that students’ participation in the alumni mentoring programs positively impacted their perceptions of their overall university experience. For example, 37 students (75 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, ‘I was satisfied with my student experience’ and 39 students (79 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ‘The alumni mentoring program was unique to other experiences such as career days and internships’. Additionally, 47 of the 49 mentees further responded that they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, ‘Due to my participation, I would like to become a mentor myself one day.’ (See Table 4.)

Similar to student responses on the alumni mentoring program’s impact on their employability, it was again found that the majority of the participants who strongly disagreed or disagreed with the programs positive impact on their university experience were from the postgraduate law program specifically. For example, of the seven students who strongly disagreed or disagreed that they were satisfied with their student experience, five were from law, and of the six students who strongly disagreed or disagreed that they felt like a member of the university community, four were from law. Additionally, both responses that indicated they strongly disagreed or disagreed that they would like to be a mentor one day were both law mentee participants. Given the small, exploratory size of this study, this finding would need to be explored in more depth in the future. However, combined with the before-mentioned outliers from the Law program, it may indicate the specific challenges of providing beneficial alumni mentoring opportunities to postgraduate students, who may have already worked in industry or may have higher expectations. It is also possible that student participants in Law had more fine-tuned and well-established career goals and subsequently expected more directed mentoring.

One of the aims of this project was to better understand how current participation in alumni mentoring programs would later influence mentees’ motivation to become mentors themselves. Therefore, in an open-ended response, mentees were also asked about whether they wanted to become a mentor themselves one day, with a total of 42 responses recorded. Common mentee responses included that they wanted to be mentors to give back to the community or help the next generation. A few mentees expressed that they wanted to mentor one day, but it depended on their future career paths. Other responses included that mentees wanted to serve as mentors to help build a professional network, and two mentees responded they already served mentors to younger students.

These responses resemble the motivations of the mentor participants, and the shift suggests that the difference between students’ and mentors’ motivations may be due less to conflicting motivations between individuals and more to the perceived benefits of each role.

# Furthering alumni engagement

Overall, the majority of mentors indicated that they felt connected to the university and committed to participating in alumni programs. Specifically, mentors were asked how the program influenced their connection to the university. The majority of mentors $( \mathtt { n } = 7 8$ ,

60 per cent) indicated they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, ‘I feel like I am a member of the university community.' Further, 80 mentors (71 per cent) indicated they agreed or strongly agreed that they would continue to serve as a mentor. Additionally, 72 mentors (58 per cent) indicated they would like to participate in other alumni opportunities such as guest lecturing or helping inform industry-related curriculum (See Table 5).

However, there are two caveats to mention about furthering alumni engagement. The first emerged through interviews, finding that alumni mentor participants often already had a close connection to the university. For example, many participants noted that they formerly worked at the university or had previously guest lectured or served on industry panels. This may have resulted in a reporting bias in these findings, as mentors were already engaged. It is also relevant to note that not all mentors had positive experiences. While the majority of mentors responded that mentees were highly engaged and respectful, a few mentioned that they have encountered some issues with disengaged mentees. For example, one mentor told a story about having mentees not show to up meet him for their arranged meeting. This negative experience had made him hesitant to participate in the program in the future.

# Discussion and recommendations

Similarities among the participants’ responses highlight the considerable opportunity that alumni mentoring programs can provide for improving both student outcomes and alumni engagement. In addition, the findings suggest that these benefits may exist across different program types, both with and without a student application process. The differences that emerged among responses also offer insight into the particular benefits and challenges of establishing an alumni mentoring program that meets the unique needs of its targeted participants. The difference that presented most strongly seemed to relate to the challenges of creating alumni mentoring programs for postgraduate students. While this article has acknowledged possible reasons for these differences, it would be valuable for future research to investigate this in more detail.

This study was limited primarily in its selection process, in that mentee participants were already higher achieving students and mentors, for the most part, had existing connections to the university. Future research may want to explore how differing student cohorts are impacted by alumni mentoring programs. The size of the study also meant that it is also not possible to state explicitly that differences between participants’ responses were due to variations in the programs’ implementations. There is, therefore, great scope for future research to follow on this study by investigating, explicitly, the potential for students who may not have self-selected into these programs or exploring participants’ pre- and post-participation attitudes. Likewise, a comparison of participating and non-participating students’ perceptions would offer a helpful next step in understanding the specific benefits of alumni mentoring programs, as would an investigation of programs across institutions.

Nonetheless, what is apparent from this study is that alumni mentoring programs are distinctively situated to provide benefits to both students’ employment perceptions and alumni engagement with the university. While more work is needed to understand more clearly how these programs may epitomise their benefits, the findings align with previous research that found the opportunity to connect students with alumni is indeed one worth pursuing (e.g., Priest & Donley, 2014; Schlee, 2000). Yet, it was also clear that there is scope to improve such programs in practice. In particular, findings support the importance of clearly explaining the objectives of the program and making sure that mentors and mentees each have reasonable expectations – or that they understand how to express those expectations. That said, the consistent themes found in these findings and expressed by both students and mentors have enabled us to devise four key recommendations for future practice. Our recommendations with descriptions are listed below.

# Take care with matching process, especially for postgraduate students

Both mentors and mentees frequently commented on the challenges of being paired with someone whose interests did not align with their own. This was most pronounced for the postgraduate law students but was evident in all three programs. At times, finding mentors in relevant careers may be more important than including someone who had graduated from the same program. It may also be helpful to encourage mentors to discuss their career trajectory and decision-making process, regardless of their chosen career. This may help all participants see the value in a match that might appear less than ideal initially.

# Encourage mentees to discuss their specific course information and subjects with mentors

Mentees sometimes responded that they did not see the value in their subjects to their future career paths. This is likely due to their inexperience in the industry, rather than the content of the subjects. Therefore, it could be helpful for mentees to discuss their past and current subjects. This would not only aid discussion between the mentor and mentee but also help the mentor discuss what they learned in similar subjects and how it has helped them in their field.

# Outline specific time commitments and emailing/phone etiquette

Select mentors and mentees both highlighted their frustration over what they perceived as a lack of engagement from their assigned mentor/mentee. This issue could be mitigated by outlining clear and specific time commitments before mentors/mentees enrol. For example, each program could indicate to all participants that the program should take up $1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ of time each week. Additionally, programs could remind mentors/ mentees about the expected emailing and phone etiquette for the program. For example, mentors/mentees could be reminded that while etiquette may differ in their culture/ industry/lifestyle that, in the program, all emails or phone calls are expected to be responded to within $4 8 \ \mathrm { h }$ .

# Provide additional structure to mentor/mentee meetings for those who request

While some mentor–mentee relationships may not need additional structure, there may be a few matches that need additional resources to help guide conversation. For this reason, programs could offer optional topics to discuss that mentors/mentees could suggest to one another, including improving the CV, interview skills, or to discuss a recent headline related to their shared industry. Mentors could also give ideas on what specific jobs within the industry they think will grow or diminish and give advice to mentees on how to best prepare for future jobs (e.g., upskilling).

# Conclusion

The study presented in this article supports the idea that alumni mentoring programs offer unique benefits to both students and alumni, thus benefiting the university as well. As aligned to our earlier research questions, we found that alumni mentoring programs had a positive impact on students’ perceptions of graduate employability, their overall student experience, and their likelihood to want to serve as a mentor one day to future students. To illustrate, we found that approximately 70 per cent of students agreed or strongly agreed that post-mentoring they were more confident about finding work and that approximately 80 per cent of students felt more equipped to discuss their personal skill sets. We also found that the majority of students felt due to their participation in an alumni mentoring program they were more satisfied with their student experience (75 per cent) and more likely to want to be a mentor themselves one day (95 per cent). These findings, while limited by the number of participants and situated in a specific context, highlight the benefits of alumni-mentoring programs.

Similar to previous research, we also present recommendations for future practice and find alignment to our recommendations on how to improve processes with studies conducted in the US context (e.g., Campbell, Smith, Dugan, & Komives, 2012; Priest & Donley, 2014). While it may be expected that students and mentors have different motivations for participating within programs, clarity and transparency of these differences may help alleviate misunderstandings. In order to maximise the value of these programs, there needs to be a stronger link between research and evaluation and the design of programs. There is further scope to investigate differences across fields and to compare pre- and post-participation attitudes. Even so, this study has provided important confirmation regarding the potential for alumni mentoring programs to improve both student employment perceptions and alumni engagement with the university. This particular combination of benefits is uniquely valuable and, as such, further research into these programs should be warranted.
