Previous process-oriented research has predominantly investigated writing processes used by non-native speakers of English (L2) and found that more proficient writers allocate more time to planning and revising than less proficient writers who spend most of their time on formulating. There is so far no exploration of the process use by novice students at university and its relationship to writing performance. Using screen recordings and interviews, we compared the writing processes and behaviours of a successful and unsuccessful student and identified considerable differences in time allocation and the interaction and recursiveness of processes. The findings highlight the importance of integrating a focus on effective process use into academic writing instruction.

# 1. Introduction

Most students have to write for assessment soon after they arrived at university, often without much knowledge of academic writing and how that may be different to the writing they experienced at secondary school. The provision of writing instruction within study programmes is known to be patchy (Wingate, 2015), and the available institutional support has traditionally consisted of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and study skills courses (Ivanic & Lea, 2006). Writing instruction is based on what is known about the genres students have to produce and the difficulties they encounter in writing them. This knowledge stems from the analysis of target genres (e.g. Hyland, 2008) and from student surveys and interviews (e.g. Evans & Morrison, 2011). Less information is available on students' activities during the extended procedure of developing an academic text, and on their engagement with the cognitive processes involved in writing, such as planning, composing and reviewing. Insights into students' use of these processes can reveal causes for successful or unsuccessful text production that have so far not been addressed in academic writing instruction. Although process knowledge is acknowledged as one of the five knowledge domains required in expert writing (Beaufort, 2007), and as one of the four domains in Tardy's (2009) model of genre knowledge, writing instruction focuses predominantly on the textual and rhetorical aspects of genre. The lack of attention to processes has been criticised by Dovey (2010) as detrimental to reading-to-write, that is students' ability to integrate evidence from sources into their texts.

Several studies have compared the writing processes of expert and novice writers and found that experts allocate more time to the processes of planning and reviewing, while novices spend most of their time on the actual formulation of the text (e.g. Sasaki, 2000). However, many process studies involve second language (L2) speakers of English, and the status of expert or novice tends to be related to their proficiency level in English. The findings might therefore be atypical for academic writing, where other factors than language proficiency determine writing processes. In addition, many process-oriented studies are not informative for academic writing, as they follow a “one-shot” (McCulloch, 2013, p. 137) approach, in which the participants were given a prompt and had to complete the writing within a fixed time. The few investigations into naturalistic academic writing provide descriptions of their participants’ process use, but do not explore process use in relation to writing performance. They also have some methodological limitations that may have impacted the accuracy of findings. There is a need, therefore, to provide more evidence of process use in naturalistic academic writing, to compare the engagement with writing processes by successful and less successful writers, and to employ research methods that facilitate a precise account of their process use. Evidence of this type can add a valuable component to the current genre- and skillsfocused writing instruction.

In this paper, we compare the use of writing processes by two students producing their first assignment at university. One obtained a high grade and the other a bare pass. The data was drawn from a larger study, in which we used multiple methods to investigate the writing processes of 13 novice students. The main data source was screen recordings, which were taken of all computer-based activities the students carried out during the production of their assignments. This method facilitated an unobtrusive and more accurate observation of writing processes than those used in previous research. As will be explained later, screen recording data can also be of value in academic writing instruction. In the next sections, we briefly introduce the cognitive process model that underpinned our study, before discussing previous process research.

# 2. The cognitive process model

In their seminal model, Flower and Hayes (1981) describe writing as the interaction of three basic processes, planning, translating and reviewing, which are influenced by the writer's long-term memory and the task environment. Planning entails the sub-components of setting goals, generating ideas, and organizing information. Translating is the process in which writers express their ideas in words and coherent text; in several studies, including ours, this process is called “formulating”. The third component, reviewing, includes the evaluation and revision of the text. Writers do not progress through the three components in a linear manner but move between them recursively. These moves are coordinated by the monitor, which determines the writer's choices according to the goals and individual writing style. The process model has proved useful for identifying differences between the writing behaviours of expert and novice writers. Expert writers typically set more precise goals than novice writers in the planning process and modify these goals throughout the composition of the text. As a result, they are more capable of retrieving relevant information, developing suitable content and carrying out adequate revisions (Hayes & Flower 1986; Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987). Although Flower and Hayes's model was modified later, the original one with its clearly distinguished writing processes provided a useful theoretical and analytical framework for our research.

# 3. Previous process-oriented writing research

Later process-oriented studies were often concerned with L2 writing and paid specific attention to the amount of time allocated to specific processes at different stages of text production and the difference in time allocation between expert and novice writers. Investigating the planning strategies of three Japanese groups writing a short essay in English, Sasaki (2000) found that expert and more skilled writers devote more time to planning and plan more globally than less skilled writers, who engage more in local planning. Global planning involves the development of a comprehensive outline and structure, while local planning focuses on linguistic and surface features, such as grammar or spelling. When L2 writers become more proficient, they change their planning strategies, approximating the behaviour of expert writers (Sasaki, 2004). Roca de Larios, Manchon, Murphy, and Marin (2008) compared the time L2 students of three language proficiency levels allocated to the different processes while writing an essay. All participants spent most of the time on formulating, with the least proficient group devoting $8 1 \%$ to this process. The most proficient group planned and reviewed their texts significantly more than the two other groups. In a comparison between L1 and L2 writing, Roca de Larios, Marin, and Murphy (2001) established that when the participants wrote in their L2, English, they spent twice as much time on formulation as when writing in their L1, Spanish. Higher-proficiency students, however, formulated during the central phases of essay production, leaving more space before and after for planning and revising. In L2 writing, a lack of language proficiency clearly affects text quality, as it compels writers to allocate too much time to formulating at the cost of the other processes.

None of these studies included the use of sources which is an important process in academic writing. McGinley (1992) examined the strategies and activities of seven undergraduate students who were required to draw on two articles for the composition of their essays. The activities identified by McGinley consisted of reading source texts, notes, and draft, and writing notes and drafts. These activities align with Flower and Hayes's (1981) processes of planning, translating and reviewing apart from reading source texts, which is an additional process that to some extent precedes planning. For the analysis of evidence-based writing, this process needs to be added to the Flower and Hayes framework. As obvious in McGinley (1992), when sources need to be consulted, the time allocation pattern changes. His participants spent an average of $4 3 . 8 \%$ on reading the sources, and only $2 8 . 6 \%$ on writing their drafts. In the third place, with $1 5 \%$ , was the activity of reading the draft, which is equivalent to the process of reviewing. McGinley's study, however, does not represent academic writing, as the participants were required to produce a short text in one session and were given sources instead of having to search for them.

Research into authentic assignment writing in university settings shows time allocation patterns similar to McGinley's findings, as the evidence-based nature of academic writing requires the use of sources. Yang and Shi's (2003) investigation of the strategies of six MBA students writing a summary found that although the students used most frequently strategies related to formulation, only $2 9 . 1 \%$ of the time was allocated to this process. This was followed by planning content $( 1 4 . 5 \% )$ and referring to sources $( 1 1 . 5 \% )$ . Stapleton (2010), interested in the difference in time allocation between “pen-and-paper” studies and naturalistic academic writing, conducted a case study of an L2 university student, Andrea, writing a 4000-word academic essay on the computer. In line with Yang and Shi (2003), he found that Andrea spent considerably less time on formulation $( 3 3 \% )$ and almost a quarter of her time on research $( 2 4 \% )$ , i.e. looking for source-based evidence for her argument. Examining the source-based writing of a policy paper by three L2 university students, Li (2013: 79) describes the recursive nature of writing behaviours, noting that “the actions of source searching, highlighting/note-taking, consulting electronic diary, and composing were recursive, and indeed were embedded in each other”. These three studies provide in-depth descriptions of the process use and writing behaviours of successful writers but lack a comparison with less successful writers. McCulloch's (2013) study of two L2 MA students offers this comparative dimension, but only in relation to one process, source use.

It has become clear that writers of evidence-based academic texts allocate their time differently from those who write short pieces without sources, and that an additional process, that of source use or “research” (Stapleton, 2010), would need to be added to the original Flower and Hayes model, if it was to be applied to the investigation of academic writing. In addition, as Stapleton (2010: 304) points out, the digital environment in which academic writing typically takes place affords immediate access to sources as well as to text revision applications. These affordances, he argues, make a reconceptualization of the process model necessary, as

… the present electronic environment used by most writers may be creating a shift in how cognitive resources are allocated. The former raw “translation” of ideas into language (in the Flower and Hayes sense) is possibly being replaced by a more strategic process that has writers

utilizing multiple tools and resources for reaching their textual goals.

Another issue, which is considered in the next section, is to whether the research methodologies used in previous process studies are capable of providing an accurate account of academic writers’ process use.

# 4. Methodologies of previous process studies

Process-oriented research can be grouped into two categories. The first consists of studies with a semi-experimental design, in which real-time writing is observed in controlled conditions. Although some of these studies involve university students as participants (e.g. Roca de Larios et al., 2008), the writing tasks are non-academic. The second category consists of research in naturalistic settings, in which an academic assignment is produced (e.g. Yang & Shi, 2003).

In the first category, the so-called “one-shot” studies, participants were given a writing prompt, typically without sources, and had to complete their composition with pen and paper, in one sitting and within a fixed time, usually $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ or 1 h. The time limit itself is likely to trigger writing behaviours and process uses that are different from academic writing. Another factor influencing writing processes is task type. Exploring factors that affect students’ performance when writing from sources, Asencion Ascencion Delaney (2008)  found that essay writing invoked more cognitive processes, particularly in planning and reviewing, than summary writing. In the same way, it is likely that academic writing involves more, as well as different, process uses than time-limited responses to a prompt.

In contrast to the one-shot studies, academic writing typically relies on the use of multiple sources, is completed in numerous sittings and draws on digital resources. The considerable differences in the task environment of academic writing and writing one-shot pieces are relevant for the investigation of novice writers at university. Their secondary school writing experience often resembles the latter task type, in that students have to develop an argument in respond to a prompt without evidence from sources. As Coffin (2006) showed in the case of History writing in Australian secondary schools, students in the final years have to produce “arguing” genres in which they are expected to either argue the case for two or more positions or argue against a single view. These arguing genres are rarely based on the consultation of sources and therefore leave students unprepared for academic writing. It is therefore likely that novices are unfamiliar with processes that are relevant in academic writing, such as source use and planning.

The process of source use as well as the digital environment add considerable complexity to the observation of the processes and behaviours involved in academic writing, which cannot be fully captured by the data collection methods of previous studies. Process-oriented writing research has followed two broad approaches, online or offline. Online data elicitation occurs during writing and provides a real-time record of text production. The methods include think-aloud protocols (e.g. Roca de Larios, Marin, & Murphy, 2001), the video-recording of the writing procedure (Sasaki 2000, 2004) and keystroke logging, a method that was for instance employed in the investigation of professional writing (Perrin, 2006). Offline data elicitation consists of the analysis of participants’ written texts, stimulated recall (Sasaki, 2004) and retrospective interviews (Li, 2013; Sasaki, 2004; Stapleton, 2010; Yang & Shi, 2003). Most studies applied a combination of methods; of those concerned with academic writing, for instance, Yang and Shi (2003) used think-aloud protocols, retrospective interviews and text analysis, while Stapleton (2010) used a process log, a retrospective questionnaire, interviews and text analysis.

All these methods have limitations, in particular for the study of academic writing. Think-aloud protocols, the most widely used method, require writers to verbalise their thoughts while working on the writing task. The method has been criticised for being intrusive and disruptive, because it imposes constraints on cognitive processes (Smagorinsky, 2001). In the context of short writing tasks in controlled conditions, the participants’ cognitive capacity might be sufficient to express their thoughts during writing; however, in the more complex task environment of academic writing, that capacity might be overstretched, and as a result, both the writing processes as well as the verbal report would be impeded. In addition, thinkaloud protocols seem impractical for research into academic writing. As participants tend to fall silent during think-aloud sessions and have to be reminded to utter their thoughts (Ericsson & Simon, 1993), the presence of a researcher would be required, which is possible in controlled conditions, but not in naturalistic academic writing, as this stretches over several, and often spontaneous, sittings.

Retrospection, be it through stimulated recall, interviews or process logs, carries the risk that writing activities and strategies are not fully recalled or reported by participants, thus being “prone to forgetting or fabrication”(McCulloch, 2013, p. 137). Methods such as keystroke logging or video-recording are capable of providing an accurate account of students' writing activities whilst being unobtrusive. However, keystroke logging only shows the development of the text, not other computerbased activities such as online searches. Video-recording, as think-aloud protocols, requires a researcher present. Given the shortcomings of the methods discussed, we have adopted screen recording as a data collection tool, which has rarely been applied in writing research. There is only one published study which reports the use of screen recording for the investigation of high-school students’ strategies for writing from internet sources (Kirkpatrick & Klein, 2016).

# 5. Research aim

As the previous discussion has shown, the findings of one-shot studies have little relevance for academic writing because of their research settings. The small number of studies into academic writing provided descriptions of process use without linking it to writing performance. None of them was concerned with novice writers. However, it is precisely the process use by students new to academic writing that needs to be better understood to enhance the quality of their instructional provision.

Our research aim was to compare process use in successful and unsuccessful academic writing by novices. The following research questions were asked:

1. What is the difference of time allocation to the various writing processes between a successful and an unsuccessful novice academic writer? 2. How do the writing behaviours differ between a successful and an unsuccessful novice academic writer?

Research question 2 (RQ2) will not be addressed in the way of Stapleton (2010), where the student's behaviours were described within each process. Whilst we are providing some information on writing behaviours in the discussion of time allocation (RQ1), our focus for RQ2 will be on the interaction and recursiveness of processes in the development of argument. These two categories will be explained later.

# 6. Methods

The research presented in this article is part of a larger investigation of the writing experiences, process use and behaviours of novice writers from four academic disciplines in the Social Sciences and Life Sciences.

# 6.1. Participants

Thirteen students who were about to write their first assignment had consented to participate, seven from an Australian and six from a British university. Their age ranged from 18 to 24, and only one was a non-native speaker of English. They studied in the disciplines of Applied Linguistics (4), Political Science (2), Tourism & Event Management (3) and Chemistry (4). The genres involved were essays, a business report and a literature review. All students were monitored from shortly before they began writing their first assignment until the point when they had received feedback. The results of the participants’ first assignment can be seen in Appendix 1. Not surprisingly, given that the students represented a self-selected sample, the majority gained high grades, and only two students received low results. For the present investigation, a case study approach involving two participants was taken. We chose the participants from the four students who had written an essay, as this is the most prevalent genre in university writing (Nesi & Gardner, 2012), and selected the two who had provided complete screen recordings for all writing sessions. These were the high-achieving Political Science student, Gina, who received a near distinction grade, and one of the two low-achieving Applied Linguistics students, Ellen (both names are pseudonyms), who achieved a bare pass grade.

# 6.2. Data collection

For the analysis of the writing processes and behaviours we drew on two data sources. The key method was observation of writing processes via the screen recording of all the students’ computer-based activities during the whole procedure of assignment production. This method was complemented by student interviews. In the larger study, we also analysed module documents as well as completed assignments and lecturer feedback. This analysis is not included in the present study.

Student observation: Unlike the previously used methods, screen recording is unobtrusive whilst providing a complete and accurate account of all activities carried out on the computer, such as information searches, the information sources used, the development of writing plans, the transformation of information into the written text, as well as any revisions of the text. Not captured are activities such as offline reading or note-taking, and we elicited in interviews to what extent the students had engaged in such activities. The students were asked to install on their computers the screen capture software Icecream. During the period before submission, we sent weekly reminders to the students asking them to activate the software whenever they worked on their assignments.

Student interviews: We interviewed each student three times, first in the planning stage, when they had received the assignment brief, then in the writing stage, about two weeks before submission, and lastly in the reflection stage, after they had received their grade and feedback comments. The interview prompts aimed to elicit their pre-university writing experience, their expectations towards academic writing and their initial plans (first interview), their experiences during writing (second interview), and their reflections on the grade and lecturers’ comments (third interview). In the second and third interview, we were able to ask some retrospective questions relating to writing activities observed in the screen recordings. Unfortunately, the screen recordings could not be fully analysed in time for the interviews, leaving some writing activities and behaviours unexplained by the students.

# 6.3. Data analysis

This analysis of the screen recordings was challenging not only because of the amount of data, but also because there is little precedent. Kirkpatrick and Klein (2016) analysed 5-minute segments for the occurrence of writing strategies, an approach that was not suitable for the analysis of time allocation. In the present case study of two students, $1 5 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ of recordings had to be analysed. Gina, who wrote a 2000-word essay on the relationship between freedom and equality from the perspectives of two political economists, recorded 11 writing sessions on which she spent a total of $1 1 . 3 \mathrm { h }$ , with the average time of $^ { 1 \mathrm { h } }$ and $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ per session. Ellen, who wrote a much shorter essay of 900 words on loan words, recorded 7 sessions on which she spent a total of $4 . 2 \mathrm { h }$ with the average time per session being $3 5 . 7 \mathrm { m i n }$ . We developed both a quantitative and a qualitative approach to analyse the screen recordings. The quantitative approach was important for identifying the students’ time allocation to writing processes (RQ1), while the qualitative approach facilitated the analysis of writing behaviours (RQ2).

Quantitative analysis: We adapted the Flower and Hayes (1981) model as analytical framework. The original Flower and Hayes' model is suitable for one-shot writing tasks, in which writers draw on their long-term memory for information. Given the task environment of academic writing, Flower and Hayes's component “Long-term memory” was replaced with the process “Consulting resources”, which contains the various types of resources used by the participants. Only small changes were made to the subcategories of the three main writing processes. In “Planning”, we removed the subcategory “Goal setting”, as this strategy was not visible in the screen-recordings. “Translating”, which in Flower and Hayes's model describes the act of writing, was replaced by the umbrella term “Composing”, as the subprocess of “Inserting references”, typical for evidence-based writing, had to be added to the subprocess of “Formulating”. In “Reviewing” we added “Editing”, a common activity in academic writing, which is facilitated by writing tools such as Grammarly. The subprocess of Editing contains activities such as formatting, correcting small errors, adding punctuation and replacing words with synonyms. Revising, by contrast, means that the writer deletes and re-writes, making substantial changes to the content of the text. Lastly, in the subprocess of Evaluating, the writer scrolls up and down, reading and re-reading the whole or parts of the text. During this sub-process, no changes are made to the draft. Fig. 1 shows our adaptation of the Flower and Hayes model.

These processes were listed in the left column of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, which served as the coding rubric. In this rubric, the main processes, Resources, Planning, Composing and Reviewing, highlighted in bold, served as headings for the subprocesses, which were coded for the time allocated to them. The time spent on each subprocess was recorded in the relevant row in sequential order. Each session was coded in a designated Excel sheet, so that the time allocated to different processes and process interaction could be determined. An example can be seen in Fig. 2, which presents $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ from Gina's fifth writing session. For the analysis, the row for “Formulating” was highlighted in yellow to explore more easily how formulating, the dominant process in earlier research, interacted with, and was facilitated by, the use of other processes. The example was chosen because it is representative of Gina's process use, which will be discussed in more detail later.

The first author and a research assistant jointly coded the first session of each student to ensure consensus in the identification of processes. The remaining 18 sessions were coded by the first author, and six of them were coded independently by the research assistant. An interrater reliability of $8 7 \%$ was achieved.

The quantitative coding was used to calculate the overall time allocated to the writing processes and to analyse their interaction. The total of minutes spent on each sub-process was calculated for each writing session. Next, for each value the percentage of the overall session time was calculated. This allowed us to compare the students’ engagement with the various processes throughout the production of the essay, as is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 below.

Qualitative analysis: For the analysis of writing behaviours, we produced a verbal description, or “translation”, of all writing sessions, specifying the details and content of all activities observed, for instance the type of resources used (e.g. Google search, Grammarly as writing tool, name of scholarly article), the line of argument developed in the process of formulating, and the nature of revisions made. Whilst the translations were time-consuming, they provided easy access to the context and contents of the writing processes that were reduced to simple time-measuring in the quantitative analysis. For instance, while the quantitative analysis only resulted in the calculation of the overall time spent on the different processes in each session, colour coding in the qualitative analysis helped to identify how often and when a particular argument was revisited and reviewed.

The interviews were analysed thematically with an initial set of themes based on the research and interview questions (e.g. “previous writing experience”) and iterative reading of the transcriptions. They were then coded independently by the first author and the research assistant. Discussion between the two coders led to the elimination of some initial themes and the addition of new themes (e.g. “task engagement”).

# 7. Findings and discussion

Both case study students were native speakers of English. Gina had regularly written essays in secondary school; however, she had not received training for academic writing, had no experience with using academic sources and worried about this in her first interview. In her second interview, she expressed satisfaction with the progress of her essay and stressed her enjoyment of writing it: “The topic is super-interesting and fascinating to me. I really enjoy thinking about the topic, that makes research a lot more of an easy experience”. Gina informed us that she had spent a lot of time on the essay outside the screen recorded sessions: “Before I even did the first screen recording I had gone to the library and just gone through so many different texts and picked up a few books and then sat on my bed brainstorming” (Interview 2).

Ellen studied Applied Linguistics as a minor subject alongside Psychology. Like Gina, she had written non-source-based essays at secondary school. Unlike Gina, she approached her essay with great uncertainty over the task but had made no effort to seek advice. When asked in her first interview how she felt about the impending assignment, she replied “I feel lost”. Asked about the difficulties she was experiencing (Interview 2), she stated “Lack of understanding, no idea what I'm doing and lack of references”. Ellen stated that she had not worked on the essay outside the screen recorded sessions.

# 7.1. Time allocation

In response to the first research question, the results of the quantitative analysis showed a considerable difference in Gina and Ellen's time allocation to some of the writing processes. We will first discuss their use of planning processes, followed by composing and reviewing.

# 7.1.1. Time allocation to planning processes

Gina devoted the entire first session of $4 2 . 1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and more than the first half of her second session (31.50 out of $5 2 . 4 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ ) to developing a detailed outline of her essay. This means that 10.9 percent of her overall essay production time of $1 1 . 3 \mathrm { h }$ was spent on planning, and that the composing processes began only after this extended phase. The planning processes involved constant consultation of her course documentation, including PDFs of relevant articles available on the course website. In Interview 3, Gina explained that she had read these articles previously as preparation for a lecture and skimmed through them again before the planning process began. During planning, Gina consulted them for specific information needed for her argument. At the end of the planning phase, Gina had produced a two-page planning document that contained the headings and the content for each paragraph in bullet points. The headings reflected precisely her line of argument, for instance “II.

Main Point 1: Counterargument” and “III. Main Point 2: Refutations of counterargument”. The bullet points specified the propositions that would form the argument and often had a note-to-self format, for instance “argue the morals/pros of a strong state …”. The outline ended with a section entitled “Books to reference/notes on said book”. These notes summarised relevant concepts and arguments proposed by the authors and indicated their location, for instance “quote/concept found on p. 170”. The comprehensive and meticulously organised outline meant that Gina had the structure and line of argument of her essay prepared before she began the composing process, during which she adhered closely to the outline. The planning document was open in the left panel of the screen during the first seven sessions, as can be seen in Appendix 2, and Gina frequently moved between the outline and the essay draft.

By contrast, Ellen did not engage in planning processes and did not develop a planning document. Throughout her seven sessions, she spent a considerable amount of time on consulting the course documentation, which contained essay instructions on content and formatting. Thirty-one percent of the first session was devoted to reading the instructions, some of which she copied and pasted at the top of her essay draft. Seven minutes into her first session, she began formulating, and $4 3 . 3 \%$ of the first session was spent on this process. Figs. 3 and 4 below illustrate the difference between Gina and Ellen's process use across their writing sessions. While Gina only began formulating after a planning period of $1 \ \%$ sessions, Ellen formulated right from the beginning without planning and allocated almost half of the time to this process in her first two sessions. This finding is consistent with previous research which found that skilled writers spend more time on global planning, such as writing outlines and detailed notes, while weaker writers spent more time on formulation (e.g. Sasaki, 2000).

# 7.1.2. Time allocation to composing and reviewing processes

The use of these processes in Gina's eleven sessions and Ellen's seven sessions of producing their assignments are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In the figures, Composing is only represented by the category of formulating, as the other category, inserting references, received minimal time allocation. Reviewing is represented by its three subprocesses of evaluating, revising and editing. The figures focus entirely on Composing and Reviewing and exclude the process of Planning. As mentioned earlier, Gina's engagement with Composing and Reviewing only began in Session 2, after the first $1 \ \%$ sessions were devoted to Planning. By contrast, Ellen's main activity in the first session is formulating.

The clearest differences are in the use of the processes of formulating and revising in the total time allocation. Gina spent only $1 4 \%$ of her overall production time of $6 7 6 . 2 \mathrm { m i n }$ on formulating, while Ellen spent $2 4 . 4 \%$ of her overall time of $2 5 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ on this sub-process. Whilst Ellen's time allocation to formulating is still lower than in other studies of academic writing $3 3 \%$ in Stapleton, 2010 and $2 9 \%$ in Yang & Shi, 2003), the fact that she spent over $1 0 \%$ more time on formulating than Gina is in line with observations from the L2 studies that less proficient writers allocate more time to formulation. This suggests that not only lower language proficiency, but also lack of process knowledge results in the overuse of formulating at the cost of other processes. Also similar to findings from L2 research is the students' time allocation to revising. Ellen spent hardly any time, i.e. $1 . 9 \%$ , on this process, while Gina allocated $1 4 . 6 \%$ of her overall production time to revising her draft. In all sessions apart from sessions 2 and 5, Gina spent considerably more time on the reviewing processes than on formulating. In session 6, she devoted more than $4 0 \%$ to revising the text she had so far developed, and her session 8 was entirely dedicated to evaluating and editing her draft. By contrast, in all but her last session, Ellen spent the majority of time on formulating.

Other differences, not visible in Figs. 3 and 4, lay in the students' consultation of resources. Ellen spent more than twice as much time than Gina on using search tools ( $1 1 . 2 \%$ versus $4 . 7 \%$ ) and on browsing in course documentation ( $7 . 8 \%$ versus $0 . 5 \%$ ). The students allocated a similar amount of time to evaluating, i.e. scrolling up and down the emergent draft (Gina $1 1 . 4 \%$ ; Ellen $1 4 . 1 \%$ ) and editing (Gina $1 2 . 1 \%$ ; Ellen $1 2 . 7 \%$ ) their drafts. However, while Gina was continually editing her draft throughout the composition sessions, most of Ellen's editing took place in her last session.

# 7.2. Differences in writing behaviours

The second research question was concerned with the difference in the two students’ writing behaviours. The first category of investigation was the interaction of processes. If formulating is regarded as the dominant process, as it represents the actual creation of a text, it is of particular interest to examine by which other processes it is typically interspersed and supported. The second category was the recursiveness of processes in the development of argument. Of interest here was whether and how regularly the students would revisit and review previous stages of their emerging argument.

# 7.2.1. Interaction of processes

Gina not only spent $1 0 \%$ less overall time on formulating than Ellen, but also formulated in shorter phases before and after engaging in other processes. Gina's average time of formulating phases was 1 min, while Ellen's was $1 . 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , indicating a higher frequency of process interaction in Gina's composition. Gina's main process interaction was between formulating and the reviewing processes, while Ellen's was between formulating and the consultation of resources.

Fig. 2, shown earlier, represents Gina's typical process interaction in which relatively short formulating phases are continually preceded and followed up by the reviewing processes. In that coding extract, the first and longest formulating phase of $1 . 7 \mathrm { m i n }$ is followed by $3 . 4 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ of engagement with the reviewing processes, of which the longest is revising with $1 . 7 \mathrm { m i n }$ . The next two formulating phases of 39 and 54 s respectively were interrupted by Gina's short consultations of the writing tool Grammarly where she looked for synonyms to replace words she had just written. The final formulating episode lasted $4 6 s ,$ , which was preceded by $1 . 8 \mathrm { m i n }$ of editing and followed by a further revision phase.

The 11.5-minute extract from Ellen's second session (Fig. 5) shows that her formulating was interspersed by frequent consultations of course documentation and information searches. This process interaction is prevalent throughout Ellen's seven composition sessions. She constantly referred back to course documentation, which included the essay instructions and an assessment rubric. Her consultation of search tools mainly consisted of Google searches for information on Japanese loanwords in English, the topic she had chosen for her essay, as well as Google translator. The information she traced included a few popular websites and one scholarly article that proved largely irrelevant to the topic. Whilst a discussion of the two writers' source use is beyond the scope of this article, one fundamental difference, which is related to the planning process, is noteworthy. Gina, as explained earlier, had read the relevant academic sources before she began composition, and summarised important concepts and arguments from these sources in her planning document. During composition, she purposefully looked up further information, mainly related to concepts and definitions, in both scholarly and non-scholarly sources. By contrast, Ellen had not read or made notes from any academic sources before composing, although reading recommendations were provided in the essay instructions. During composition, she searched course documents and popular websites to gain information and ideas. Ellen's behaviour shows that novice students must be made aware that academic writing requires a planning process in which identifying and evaluating sources are the main components. Whilst this component is not included in Stapleton's (2010) description of Andrea's planning activities, extensive source-use practices at the planning stage are presented in Li (2013).

Gina's careful preparation enabled her to focus on the quality of her text while composing it. Ellen's lack of preparation and insufficient understanding of the task, reported in Interview 2, are reflected through her constant reference to the essay instructions. Although these provided explicit step-by-step guidance including examples, they did not help Ellen to complete the task successfully. Ellen was obviously unfamiliar with the processes needed for academic writing. Had she for instance carried out comprehensive planning, she would have engaged with the essay task and instructions in a more systematic and analytical manner. As the next section shows, Ellen also failed to use the reviewing processes recursively.

# 7.2.2. Recursiveness of processes in the development of argument

Gina developed an argument against the entitlement theory of justice by a libertarian philosopher. Her essay consists of seven paragraphs. In the Introduction, she presented the theory as well as a contrasting theory of distributive justice and announces her stance. In paragraph 2, she explained the entitlement theory in detail. In paragraphs 3 and 4, she put forward her own arguments against the entitlement theory, followed by paragraphs 5 and 6, where she used the contrasting theory to refute the entitlement theory. In the final paragraph, she concluded by summarising her argument. Although Gina wrote the paragraphs sequentially, she constantly went back from the paragraph she was currently writing to evaluate and revise the preceding ones. This means that each paragraph was regularly revisited and either revised, often to align it to the developing argument, or edited. For the editing process, the various functions of the application Grammarly were constantly used; in addition, Gina used WordCounter.net to keep a regular check on her word count.

Appendix 3 shows the cyclical development of Gina's Introduction as an example. The second half of her session 2 and the first $1 2 \mathrm { m i n }$ of session 3 were spent to complete the first draft of this paragraph. At this stage, the two key terms of the theory under discussion, equality and freedom, remained undefined, although Gina had consulted several scholarly sources. As she moved on to the next paragraph, she left a note-to-self in the first paragraph “Insert definition”. In all the remaining sessions, apart from Session 10, Gina returned to the Introduction, usually for a few minutes, for evaluation, revisions and editing. In Session 9, she revisited the Introduction twice, for 3.6 and $1 0 . 3 \mathrm { m i n }$ respectively, to search further for the definitions of equality and freedom. This work was continued for $2 6 . 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ in the final session, before she eventually supplied the definitions. Gina's cyclical and recursive way of composing, in which the formulating process was continuously interspersed by the reviewing of previous paragraphs, ensured not only a high quality of text formatting, accuracy and expression, but also the coherence of her argument.

Ellen did not write her text sequentially but began by formulating a paragraph that would later be in the middle part of her essay. Next, having consulted the essay instructions on the expected structure, she inserted the required headings and wrote the Introduction, which bore no relationship with the previously written paragraph. Throughout her sessions, she produced individual paragraphs or sentences without linking them. She describes this approach in Interview 3:

I: Did you have a clear idea what would be the main argument or point when you started writing? E: No.   
I: Could you explain your strategy?   
E: I get what I want in the assignment, so usually, it's like a narrative or a metaphor or linguistic data, and t write as much as I can think about. And then, I go back through and I edit and I try to fit it all in one piece.

As a result of this composing behaviour, no coherent argument was developed, and Ellen reports in the same interview feedback comments made by her lecturer: “I remember that she said that she couldn't follow my thinking and that it seemed very jumbled and unorganised”. In contrast to Gina, Ellen never revised text in paragraphs other than the one she was currently writing.

# 8. Conclusion

In this case study of a successful and unsuccessful novice writer, the contrast between their process use and writing behaviours could not be starker. This might raise the question whether a comparison was valid, given that Gina was strongly invested in her subject and highly interested in the essay topic, whilst Ellen wrote this essay for a minor subject and had not made an effort to clarify the task requirements. Certainly, research with a larger number of students is needed to establish how representative the observed behaviours are, as only indicative conclusions can be drawn from a case study with one student in each category. However, the fact that neither student had received training in the processes of academic writing or had experience in source-based writing justifies the comparison. The sharp contrast between the two students is useful not only for showing the need for process-oriented writing instruction, but also for teaching purposes. While some students may adopt effective process use naturally as Gina did, it can be assumed that many students facing their first assignment are in a similar position as Ellen, feeling uncertain about the task and following the writing approaches practised in secondary school essays, namely writing spontaneously and unplanned “as much as I can think about” and expressing opinion on a topic rather than researching information from sources.

An important pedagogical implication is therefore that novice writers need to learn how evidence-based writing is planned in relation to the reading of scholarly sources. In the Hayes and Flower model, writing was understood to proceed from “long term memory”, with knowledge of the topic emerging from the writer's mind. In academic writing, knowledge of the topic needs to be developed prior to and as part of the planning process. Before commencing planning, Gina had read widely, identified the main scholarly arguments pertinent to her topic, and begun to outline her argument. As Ellen had not engaged with these activities, the content of her essay was not informed by the literature, but driven by her own thoughts, supplemented by topical reference materials searched for during the formulation process. These finding suggests that in academic writing instruction for novices, a process component should be added to the dominant genre-based approaches, which pays specific attention to pre-planning and planning. The teaching of writing should go beyond the textual and rhetorical features of the target genre to include reading-to-write activities that help develop students' ability to identify and integrate information from sources.

For process-oriented academic writing instruction, evidence of the type gathered in our comparison of a successful and an unsuccessful writer is valuable. Whilst most writing guides and courses alert students to the need of planning and reviewing, they might not provide sufficient detail about how this is effectively done. In the case of planning, it would be important to show not only the amount of time that successful writers such as Gina invest in this process, but also the characteristics of the planning document. If Gina's example was used for instruction, extracts from the screen recordings could demonstrate how, with constant reference to scholarly papers and her lecture notes, she developed an outline that reflected the structure, content and argument of her essay. Students could be asked to analyse the graphs with Gina and Ellen's time allocation to the composing and reviewing processes (Figs. 3 and 4) to discover that in Ellen's case, formulating was the dominant process and launched without planning, whilst in Gina's case, formulating was always interwoven with the reviewing processes. These examples, perhaps with further evidence from the screen recordings, would help to raise students' awareness of the fact that academic writing requires a different engagement with the writing processes than their school writing might have done. In addition to representing a useful method for the observation of writing processes, the screen recordings can serve as a teaching tool that illustrates successful and unsuccessful process use to novice writers.
