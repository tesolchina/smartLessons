Aviation English (AE) represents a noteworthy area of investigation within the realm of English for Specific Purposes (ESP), aimed at fostering English language competency among aspiring pilots. In this study, a simulation-based aviation English course was designed and implemented for improved learning gains. The present study took place at a tertiary educational institution, focusing on the analysis of AE vocabulary development, the readback performance of student pilots, and the examination of participants’ perceptions of simulation-based training. Employing a mixed-methods sequential explanatory research design, data were gathered from 21 ab-initio pilots enrolled in the Pilotage Training program. The quantitative results showed that participants significantly improved their readback performance and AE vocabulary knowledge over the course of a semester. With regard to the qualitative results, student pilots overall perceived the simulationbased training as an innovative and effective method. The present study, therefore, constitutes a notable advancement in the AE research domain by documenting, for the first time, the application of simulation-based training in the aviation context. Moreover, the study offers insights into the implications for ESP practitioners and stakeholders in the aviation sector, along with recommendations for future research, which are delineated in the study’s conclusion.

# 1. Introduction

Aviation English standard phraseology adheres to a prescribed set of linguistic conventions tailored to the aviation context, contrasting with the informal nature of conversational English; it is a regulated, shortened, jargon-filled language that uses numbers and descriptors to quickly and effectively communicate important information. Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) deliver instructions that pilots must comprehend and read back clearly and emotionlessly, all while juggling several other duties in the cockpit. Even though advances in technology have made it possible to communicate even more clearly over the radio, it is still susceptible to background noise, which makes radiotelephony messages harder to understand (Dinçer & Demirdöken, 2023). Besides the challenging nature of radiotelephony communication, pilots must also maintain awareness of surrounding traffic. In this sense, they need to develop high levels of situational awareness, and their inability to attain it may lead to accidents (Borowska, 2018). Besides, the high cognitive load of flying consumes cognitive resources that may be used to process and respond to verbal input (Trippe & Baese-Berk, 2019). In addition, there is increased interconnectedness and frequency of interactions among English speakers with various linguistic backgrounds in various industries, including the aviation industry. This transformation in the nature of interlocutors may lead to communication breakdowns, which, in turn, pose a significant threat to the safety of flight operations. Therefore, any burden on pilots needs to be eased by means of innovative instructional solutions.

In our dynamic world, aviation profoundly impacts daily life. Despite the commonplace nature of air accident reports in the twenty-first century, the safety of flight operations remains a paramount concern, given the reliance on air travel and its perceived safety. Human factors have emerged as pivotal contributors to aviation incidents and accidents, warranting serious attention (Dobson, 2017). This issue gained traction following the Tenerife disaster report, prompting civil aviation authorities to emphasize the importance of English language proficiency. Since 2008, all pilots and air traffic controllers must demonstrate Operational Level (Level 4) proficiency in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) English Language Proficiency Test, which assesses the test-takers English language proficiency in six areas, namely pronunciation, structure, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension, and interaction.

Researchers (Hamzah, 2021; Ishihara & Prado, 2021; Thorpe, Estival, Molesworth, & Eidels, 2022) have increased their interest in studying communication errors in the aviation context, with varying results regarding how these errors influence pilots’ performance. For instance, Hamzah (2021) examined six ab initio air traffic controllers’ pilot-controller communication mistakes during simulation training and concluded that pronunciation errors almost never caused comprehension problems for controllers and pilots who were accustomed to using English in lingua franca settings and had similar first languages. Ishihara and Prado’s (2021) study differs from Hamzah’s (2021) in that it found a direct correlation between imprecise communication and potentially fatal incidents, as well as severe repercussions for miscommunication in radiotelephony. They further concluded that miscommunication must be cleared up right away in favor of both interlocutors, namely pilots and ATCOs, since it is directly associated with safety and thus human lives. As regards the communication skills of pilots, Molesworth and Estival (2015) observed a decrease in the effectiveness of English communication when a single radio message necessitated four or more pieces of information, a phenomenon that became evident when pilots experienced overload, typically during take-off and landing. Thorpe and his colleagues’ (2022) study, however, revealed that factors commonly thought to hinder English communication, such as workload, increased ATCO speech rate, and information density, did not deter pilots from prioritizing flying. The studies mentioned above collectively underscored that proficient communication in English could encounter impediments during flight operations, notwithstanding pilots’ ability to manage cockpit tasks efficiently. These findings underscore the significance of English language proficiency, alongside other human factors, in ensuring the safety of flight operations. Consequently, it is imperative to provide comprehensive English language training to ab initio pilots, utilizing innovative instructional tools. Such measures have the potential to prevent incidents and accidents caused by communication errors.

In order to demonstrate preventive actions, it is crucial to address the development of L2 vocabulary in relation to the English language proficiency of student pilots. Coxhead (2012) argues that understanding and employing the terminology for certain reasons demonstrates the learners’ membership in a particular group. Therefore, learners need to use that language to demonstrate understanding, create meaning, and interact with disciplined information. In addition to the job-specific English language skills, aviation English learners also need a solid vocabulary foundation to become proficient speakers before they step into the cockpit. Furthermore, in aviation, both student- and in-service pilots must sit for the English language proficiency test, which includes assessments of speaking and listening skills as well as vocabulary knowledge. Therefore, effective training geared toward lexical expansion among student pilots becomes critical in the aviation context. Researchers have recently made seminal contributions in this regard (Atay & Ozbulgan, 2007; Dinçer & Dinçer, 2021; Fainman & Tokar, 2018, 2021; Fursenko, Bystrova, & Druz, 2021, pp. 118–127). An early attempt by Atay and Ozbulgan (2007) examined the impact of context-based learning and memory technique teaching on aviation-related vocabulary recall. The results of this experimental study revealed that the experimental group that received memory training had significantly higher vocabulary gain scores than the control group that received conventional contextual vocabulary training. A more recent contribution by Fainman and Tokar (2021) investigated the influence of real movies in ESP classes on the students’ vocabulary learning. During the 12-week-long intervention study, the treatment group was offered authentic air crash investigation movies, whereas the control group received instruction through conventional means, yet both groups were assigned identical tasks assessing vocabulary knowledge. The results demonstrated that the students who had seen real films fared statistically better than the control group, and the researchers drew the conclusion that ESP instructors might facilitate vocabulary learning through the use of real video content. Similarly, Dinçer and Dinçer (2021) created a serious game for vocabulary training in an aviation English course. The researchers aimed to teach the target aviation vocabulary in order to achieve quantifiable outcomes, and to combine game mechanics with educational goals in order to achieve the intended learning outcome. Based on their findings, the researchers reported compelling evidence that serious gaming facilitated ESP vocabulary learning. The work in this area generally focuses on empowering and facilitating vocabulary learning for student pilots. In line with this goal, the current study expands on previous research by investigating a previously unexplored topic: the impact of simulation-based vocabulary training on the lexical expansion of student pilots.

Simulation offers the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-life situations. For many in the aviation industry, the word “simulation” conjures up visions of complex computer-generated replicas that closely replicate the look and feel of the cockpit. However, before beginning actual flight training exercises, the majority of early pilots were required to listen to lectures in class. Later, the tremendous cost of lives and airplane losses led to the development of flight simulators to promote safety in training (West & Lane-Cummings, 2007). Therefore, people frequently turn to simulation when the real system or environment is unavailable or potentially dangerous (Kuofie & Suman, 2021). It is an effective approach to developing complex skills, and a noticeable difference is evident through its incorporation into learning environments. Therefore, several different ESP settings, such as nursing (Sanford, 2014), psychology (Fisher, Rizzo, Caird, & Lee, 2011), and chemistry (Cai, Wang, & Chiang, 2014), have integrated it. Traditionally, pilots’ simulation sessions included basic flight training, combat maneuvering training, instrument training, decision-making training, and crew resource management (Salas, Bowers, & Rhodenizer, 1998). Despite the high-quality results of research on simulation’s effectiveness in aviation (Jentsch & Curtis, 2017), the aviation industry has not used simulation to enhance student pilots’ English language proficiency. This may be linked to the cost and difficulty of designing and developing simulations for such a purpose. Alternatively, ESP researchers appear to face the challenge of adapting existing software and hardware for language teaching in aviation. Bridging the gap between the challenges posed by adapting existing software and hardware for aviation language teaching, this paper serves as a guideline for practitioners in this field.

In aviation, communication errors pose a significant risk due to their potential for fatal outcomes, as demonstrated by past experiences. Therefore, we should provide effective AE training to individuals who aspire to become pilots, and we should thoroughly investigate the individual differences that could impact their English language proficiency, given that AE remains relatively understudied. In this sense, the present study explores the AE vocabulary development and the readback performance of student pilots by designing simulation-based AE training. Additionally, the researchers analyze learners’ perceptions of this innovative training method. Consequently, the researchers address the following research questions:

1. How will simulation-based AE training influence the readback performance and the vocabulary development of student pilots? 2. What are the perceptions of student pilots toward simulation-based aviation English training?

# 2. Material and methods

# 2.1. Research design and course implementation

The present study utilized a mixed-methods sequential explanatory research methodology, as described by Ivankova, Creswell, and Stick (2006). This approach involves two phases of data collection and analysis. Quantitative data were collected first, followed by qualitative data. The overarching goal of this research design is to use the qualitative information to further explain the preliminary quantitative findings. Therefore, we designed and implemented a 15-week-long simulation-based AE course. For simulation purposes, we used the latest version of the Microsoft Flight Simulator. The latest version of the Microsoft Flight Simulator provides customizable flight missions that incorporate aviation vocabulary, allowing researchers to set the flight parameters to accurately simulate real-life scenarios. During the simulation sessions, students sat in front of a high-end computer that was running the flight simulation software. Students were individually assigned a different flight mission each week, and they were required to communicate with the air traffic controller (ATCO) and fly the aircraft simultaneously by means of the following hardware: a yoke (to manipulate the flight control surfaces of the aircraft), a throttle quadrant (to control the engine thrust), and a headset (to communicate with the ATCO) (Figure 1). Students conducted the simulation sessions in a Diamond 40 aircraft, the same aircraft they will use for their real flight training upon successful completion of this simulation-based AE course. As a result, these simulation sessions would contribute to students upcoming flight training for the Private Pilot License (PPL).

Figure 1. The visual representation of the classroom setting.

By the end of the semester, each student had completed ten simulation sessions, each of which simulated a unique phase of a flight. Then, on week 13 or 14, they all simulated a full flight communicating with the ATCO. The students learned implicit vocabulary during each simulated flight mission (Table 1). That is, before the start of each flight mission, the software introduced vocabulary related to flight controls, aircraft instrument panels, aircraft failures, and flight maneuvers. The amount of exposure to implicit vocabulary teaching varied depending on the chosen flight mission. Then, students had to successfully complete the assigned flight mission, requiring them to recognize and utilize the previously presented vocabulary. Week 3, for example, introduces the cockpit instruments via the simulation software to the student pilot, who then starts the assigned flight mission and communicates with the ATCO to ask for route clearance, start-up, and push-back within the same mission. To maintain control of the aircraft and ATCO communication simultaneously, you must recognize the relevant vocabulary. As described in the ICAO’s language proficiency requirements and assessed in the proficiency tests, the minimum vocabulary knowledge should be as follows: Pilots’ vocabulary range and accuracy are usually sufficient to communicate effectively on common, concrete, and work-related topics (ICAO, 2007). The simulation sessions from Week 2 through Week 12 included the practice of separate phases of a standard flight, aiming to improve aviation vocabulary and readback performance by simulating the challenging nature of flying an airplane in real life. In Weeks 13 and 14, the students simulated a complete flight, leading to variations in the average time spent on the simulator.

# 2.2. Setting and participants

The pilotage department of a tertiary-level institution in Turkiye conducted the present study. The academic curriculum commences with a preparatory class spanning two semesters, focusing on the acquisition of general English language proficiency. Subsequently, students embark on the Pilotage Training academic program, which lasts eight semesters, culminating in the award of a Bachelor of Science diploma upon successful completion. In the initial three semesters, students undertake academic courses related to aviation and engineering. From the fourth semester onwards, they engage in theoretical pilot training aligned with international standards. Concurrently, they conduct their inaugural flights in the fourth semester, qualifying for a Private Pilot License (PPL-A). Over the ensuing four semesters, students undergo flight training and further theoretical pilot instruction to meet the requirements for an Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL-A) issued by the Directorate of Civil Aviation of Turkey (DGCA). In terms of compliance with the ICAO’s English language proficiency standards, students enroll in Aviation English I and Aviation English II courses in the third and fourth semesters, respectively. In addition to these courses, the students participated in a simulation-based pilotage training course, specifically tailored to meet the research objectives of this study. These courses differed significantly in their purpose and content. The Aviation English I and II courses aim to enhance learners’ language skills through subject-specific texts and dialogues and prepare them for the ICAO English Language Proficiency exam. The Simulation-based Pilotage Training course, on the other hand, focuses on the readback performance in radio communication and aviation English vocabulary by simulating the real work setting. In addition, the former is delivered online, and the Civil Aviation course book is used as the main source of information, whereas in-person attendance is compulsory and there is no course book in the latter.

Twenty-one student pilots in the Pilotage Department participated in the study. Purposive sampling, characterized by the deliberate selection of settings, individuals, or events (Taherdoost, 2016), guided the selection process. These participants were in their third semester of the undergraduate pilotage program. We chose this cohort because they had not yet completed any aviation English courses or started the Private Pilot License (PPL) curriculum at the time of the investigation. Additionally, none of the participants had prior experience with flight simulators, a factor deemed important to ensure the reliability of the study findings. By using these purposeful selection criteria, the researcher hoped to get unique and useful information that would not be possible with other sampling methods. This way, they were able to get a group of participants with the most similar aviation backgrounds.

# 2.3. Data collection tools and procedures

The study employed a mixed-methods sequential explanatory research design, and data collection proceeded according to the outlined protocol (Table 2). Initially, we administered a Vocabulary Knowledge Test (VKT) during Week 1 prior to the start of the simulation-based course. We gathered participant responses to the VKT using Quizizz, a Web 2.0 tool. Following the completion of all simulation sessions, we re-administered the VKT during Week 14 to assess the vocabulary knowledge of student pilots. Meanwhile, researchers assigned 10 readback performance tasks to participants throughout the semester to monitor performance changes over time. Lastly, researchers conducted a focus-group interview during Week 15, coinciding with the semester’s conclusion, to obtain qualitative data.

# 2.3.1. Vocabulary knowledge test

The primary quantitative data collection instrument utilized in this study was a vocabulary knowledge test (VKT) specifically developed by the researchers for this investigation. The VKT aimed to evaluate the impact of simulation sessions on participants’ aviation-related vocabulary knowledge and comprised twenty multiple-choice questions (Figure 2). Each question pertained to one of the twenty target aviation-related vocabulary terms randomly selected from the flight missions featured in the Microsoft Flight Simulator. Scoring on the test ranged from 0 to 100, with each question carrying a value of five points. To assess the reliability of the test, an item difficulty analysis was conducted. Item analysis, as described by Singh, Gupta, and Singh (2009), entails scrutinizing student responses to individual test items to gauge item and overall test quality for potential improvement or revision. It facilitates the identification of high-quality multiple-choice questions based on the difficulty index (DIF I) and the discrimination index (DI), as outlined by Garg, Kumar, and Maria (2018). The P value serves as the difficulty index (DIF I), with higher values indicating simpler items and vice versadan aspect clarified by Osterlind (2002). According to Osterlind, an item difficulty index between 0.40 and 0.80 is considered suitable for achievement tests. Azzopardi and Azzopardi (2019) propose a range of 0.30–0.80 for multiple-choice questions in the social sciences, classifying these as moderately difficult. Items falling below 0.3 or above 0.8 may necessitate modification. Analysis of the VKT items revealed a DIF I range between 0.33 and 0.80, indicating moderate difficulty across all multiple-choice questions. Furthermore, discrimination index analysis categorized half of the questions as excellent and the remaining half as good (Garg et al., 2018). Additionally, internal consistency reliability was assessed using the Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20) test, commonly employed for this purpose (Bademci, 2011). Nunnally (1978) suggests an internal reliability coefficient value exceeding 0.7; in this study, the calculated value was 0.72, affirming satisfactory internal consistency reliability of the VKT. Consequently, the VKT emerged as a reliable research instrument for assessing the aviation English vocabulary knowledge of student pilots.

# 2.3.2. Readback performance tasks

The second quantitative data collection tool employed in this study consisted of readback performance tasks, aiming to ascertain the potential statistically significant impact of simulation-based training on the readback performance of student pilots. Readback in aviation refers to the pilot’s action of restating or verifying a message or clearance they have received from the ATCO. When the ATCO issues instructions to a pilot, such as authorizing takeoff, specifying a different altitude, or assigning a new direction, it is obligatory for the pilot to repeat the information back in order to verify its accuracy. The goal of this readback is to assure the controller that the pilot has accurately received and understood the given instructions. A typical procedure for a readback involves the pilot restating the elements of the message, including the aircraft’s assigned identifier, the instruction or clearance given, and any specific details mentioned. According to ICAO Radiotelephony Manual (ICAO, 2007), an example of a standard full readback procedure is described in Figure (3):

![](img/c770940ed555b8b1cbfc7df25c68ac74fefc270b5dc9a51bee29f5953548d70e.jpg)  
Figure 3. A sample readback procedure (ICAO, 2007, p. 30).

Figure 3 illustrates that all types of airplanes, lacking any device to automatically execute this procedure, adhere to a standard readback procedure. The pilots are, therefore, required to perform the readback procedure at all times, regardless of the airplane they are flying. Therefore, the readback performance tasks were structured to simulate the readback procedures in all phases of a flight. These included the following topics, respectively: getting the departure ATIS (Airport Terminal Information System), route clearance, start-up, push-back, taxi, line-up, take-off, initial climb, end-of-climb, position report, descent, arrival ATIS, final approach, and landing. Overall, these tasks yielded a maximum total of 100 points, with a success threshold set at 60, aligning with the minimum operational level stipulated in the ICAO Language Proficiency Requirements (LPR).

Computer-based flight simulation software administered the simulation-based training program from Week 2 to Week 15, excluding the midterm exam on Week 8 and the final exam on Week 15. Each student pilot undertook ten tasks on the simulator during this training phase (Table 3). Following each simulation session, student pilots were assigned a readback performance task accessible via Flipgrid, a Web 2.0 platform, which was chosen for its user-friendly interface and accessibility across both computer and mobile devices. We promptly communicated task assignments to students via email and the institution’s learning management system upon the completion of each session. Tasks remained accessible until the beginning of the subsequent session, giving student pilots plenty of time to complete them. Each task required participants to listen to instructions delivered by an air traffic controller (ATCO), comprehend the instruction, and subsequently deliver an appropriate readback response. Participants recorded and uploaded their responses to the Flipgrid platform, facilitating seamless submission and evaluation.

The researchers developed a readback performance assessment rubric in accordance with the ICAO LPR to assess each performance (cfr. Appendix 1). Moskal and Leydens (2000) highlighted the significance of validity and reliability when developing a scoring rubric and suggested that any rubric must include three types of evidence, namely content-related evidence, construct-related evidence, and criterion-related evidence. All these issues were considered in the present study.

Firstly, content-related evidence refers to the extent to which a student’s responses to a particular assessment tool demonstrate their comprehension of the relevant content area. Each readback performance task aligns with the weekly topic, allowing the assessment rubric to accurately determine whether the students have acquired the necessary knowledge and skills for the learning objectives. The construct-related evidence is concerned with whether the components of the reviewed responses serve as sufficient indicators of the underlying construct. Therefore, we developed the rubric in this study in accordance with the ICAO LPR to assess the students’ performance against pre-existing norms in the target work setting and accurately identify the underlying construct of readback performance. Finally, the criterion-related evidence backs up how closely an assessment’s findings correspond to a present or upcoming event. In this sense, the rubric developed for this research study explicitly assessed the learners’ performance on the readback procedure, and thus, the findings of this assessment could truly represent a real-life task for the learners’ future profession in the aviation industry. As a result, the readback performance assessment rubric consisted of the following criteria: pronunciation, fluency, and comprehension. The focus here was not on accent but on intelligibility.

# 2.3.3. Focus-group interview

The sole qualitative data collection tool employed was a semi-structured focus group interview, administered to five student pilots who willingly participated in the study. The interview aimed to elucidate the participants’ perspectives on the novel approach within the aviation English learning environment, encompassing twelve sets of questions (cfr. Appendix 2). We delivered the interview questions in the participants’ native language, Turkish, to facilitate a deeper understanding of their learning experiences, acknowledging the efficacy of understanding the experiences of individuals navigating similar challenges as a means to glean insights into educational and broader societal matters (Seidman, 2013).

# 2.4. Data analysis

# 2.4.1. Analysis of the VKT

Participants’ responses to the VKT were analyzed using the SPSS software (v. 25). The criteria for selection of this particular version of the SPSS software were the researchers’ prior experience and familiarity with it, as well as the alignment of its statistical tools with our data analysis purposes. The researchers first performed preliminary tests to determine if the dataset met the normality assumption. As such, Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests of normality were run, skewness and peakedness values were calculated, and the $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { Q - Q } }$ plots were analyzed. These preliminary tests were then followed by the parametric tests since data were normally distributed for the VKT. In this sense, a paired-samples t-test was run for this variable, which clearly showed the influence of simulation-based AE training on student pilots’ AE vocabulary knowledge over the course of a semester.

# 2.4.2. Analysis of the readback performance tasks

Student pilots’ performance on the readback tasks was also analyzed using the SPSS software (v. 25). The researchers and a licensed ICAO rater independently completed the scoring. The intraclass correlation coefficient, recognized as a prominent reliability index in various reliability analyses such as test-retest, intra-rater, and inter-rater evaluations, was computed to assess both the correlation and agreement between measurements of continuous data (Koo & Li, 2016). The objective was to determine if the scoring by two independent raters demonstrated a significant correlation, thereby guaranteeing a reliable interpretation of the student pilots’ proficiency in pronunciation, fluency, and comprehension skills during the readback performance tasks. The outcome of the reliability analysis revealed an intraclass correlation coefficient of. 981 (Table 3), a value deemed excellent according to the classification by Koo and Li (2016). Also, the F-test resulted in an F value of 52,994 with degrees of freedom of 209, yielding a p-value of 0.000. This statistically significant result $\left( \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ indicates that the intraclass correlation coefficient of. 981 (Table 4) is not only numerically high but also statistically significant, confirming the reliability of the raters’ scoring.

# 2.4.3. Analysis of the focus-group interview

As for the analysis of the qualitative data collected by means of a semi-structured focus-group interview, a qualitative content analysis method, including the identification of thematic patterns in a qualitative dataset (Neuendorf & Kumar, 2016), was adopted. Throughout the qualitative data analysis, the researchers engaged in the parallel coding process as suggested by Thomas (2006). Elo and Kyngäs (2008) suggested completing the data analysis in three phases: preparation, organizing, and reporting. Accordingly, the analysis started with the researcher transcribing a total of 45-min-long interview data. Two independent coders iteratively coded the transcribed data using open, axial, and selective coding techniques (Boeije, 2010; Flick, 2009). This process yielded distinct sets of initial codes derived from the original data, which enabled the researchers to identify and group the commonalities in responses. After comparing various sets of codes, the researchers negotiated the categories and sought thematic patterns among the emerging codes. Finally, during the debriefing with the same inter-coder, the findings were discussed, and the final themes were shaped by the researchers.

# 3. Results

The present study sought answers to two questions, as stated in previous headings. The quantitative data collected from the twenty-one participants determined, among these research questions, the influence of simulation-based AE training on the vocabulary knowledge and readback performance of student pilots. In addition, the perceptions of student pilots toward this training were explored based on the qualitative dataset, which included the responses of five volunteers to twelve interview questions.

# 3.1. Quantitative results

A paired-samples t-test was used to determine the change in student pilots’ overall AE vocabulary knowledge over the course of a semester. As can be seen in Table 5, a statistically significant difference between the vocabulary knowledge pretest $\mathbf { \overline { { X } } } = 4 9 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 1 1 . 8 9 7 _ { . }$ ) and post-test ${ \bf \overline { { X } } } = 8 0 . 4 8$ , $\sigma = 9 . 0 7 0$ ) scores was found, and the vocabulary knowledge of student pilots at the end of the course was significantly higher compared to their vocabulary knowledge at the beginning of the course $\mathsf { t } ( 2 0 = - 3 6 . 7 5 2$ , $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } = 0 0 . 0 0 0 \} } \end{array}$ ).

Student pilots’ scores on the readback performance tasks were analyzed to find out if simulation sessions had any influence on the overall readback performance of learners. Table 6 reveals that Task 6 had the lowest mean score, with raters’ average score of 6.88. In contrast, Task 5 achieved the highest score, with an average of raters’ scores of 9.30. Therefore, it was concluded that student pilots’ readback performance on Task 5 was the best, whereas their performance on Task 6 was the worst in terms of pronunciation, fluency, and comprehension.

Also, it was inferred that there was at least one student who received 10 out of 10 in all tasks except Task 10, in which the highest score given by the raters was 9.50 out of 10. Finally, the average of raters’ scoring was found to be the lowest in Task 3 and Task 4, with an average score of 4.25. However, Task 1 received the highest minimum score of 7.25 from the raters, indicating the least variation in the student pilots’ performance compared to other tasks. However, Task 3 and Task 4 showed the highest variation in readback performance.

To assess the impact of simulation-based training on the readback performance of student pilots, the researchers employed a one-sample T-test, with a specific focus on evaluating whether students’ overall performance across all readback tasks met industry standards. Given that ICAO Level 4 serves as the minimum proficiency standard in aviation, a benchmark score of 60 points, aligned with this industry standard in the assessment rubric, was considered the reference value for evaluating students’ performance in fluency, pronunciation, and comprehension. The one-sample T-test (Table 7) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the students’ overall scores on all readback tasks $\bar { \mathbf { X } } = 8 2 . 9 2$ , $\pi = 6 . 1 4 4$ ) and the ICAO level 4 benchmarks, which set a minimum score of 60. Specifically, students’ cumulative scores on the readback tasks significantly surpassed the ICAO level 4 standards by the conclusion of the course $( \mathrm { t } ( 2 0 ) = 1 7 . 1 0 0$ , $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } = 0 0 . 0 0 0 \} } \end{array}$ . Consequently, it was concluded that engagement with the readback tasks facilitated student pilots’ attainment of the ICAO LPR across the aforementioned language competencies.

# 3.2. Qualitative results

The qualitative content analysis was performed to analyze the data collected from the focus-group interview, and it yielded fifteen categories, which then turned into four major themes describing the perceptions of student pilots toward simulation-based AE training (Table 8).

# 3.2.1. Theme I occupational outcomes

The first theme identified in the qualitative content analysis of the interview data was labeled as occupational outcomes, and it included five categories, namely alignment with the learners’ prospective career, building awareness, knowledge gain, knowledge transfer, and other learning gains. The participants overall perceived the simulation-based AE course as directly aligned with the skills they need to develop for employment in the aviation industry. Regarding the alignment with the learners’ prospective career, for instance, Interviewee 4 highlighted an occupational outcome related to efficient communication on the radio with the air traffic controllers in the following excerpt:

ICAO had released a report on the cognitive load of the pilots during takeoff and landing. They were too occupied with controlling the aircraft and communicating with the air traffic controllers. For these reasons, it is important for student pilots to develop an understanding of these exchanges before they step in the cockpit. I am happy that I have it at the end of the course (Interviewee 4).

Along similar lines with Interviewee 4, another participant, Interviewee, 1 stated that the course was beneficial for him: . everything you learn during the flight simulation will be right in front of you in the cockpit. Therefore, it is practical since you use it already.” In addition, Interviewee 5 mentioned building awareness by means of simulation sessions and associated this outcome with his future career in the following statement: “When I go to the airfield and start my PPL, I will be overloaded with the tasks that I need to do at once. So, this prepares me psychologically, physically, every way. It is beneficial.”

Building on this occupational outcome, Interviewee 3 reported on knowledge gain and knowledge transfer: “This course was related to my ideal job . I learned the phases of a flight and so, I learned how to pick the most appropriate word depending on the phase of the flight. I didn’t have this experience before starting my training.” Similarly, Interviewee 5 commented: “I developed a good understanding of the radio communication with the air traffic controllers, and I was able to use the new knowledge in the simulator to complete the missions. And that’s very useful for me.” Finally, Interviewee 1 stated transferring the recently acquired knowledge into the simulation sessions in the following excerpt: “It was kind of similar to flying a real aircraft. And actually, it all depends on the procedure, because if you know the procedure in the simulator you will do it in real life.”

In addition to the aforementioned occupational outcomes, participants also mentioned some other learning gains. Interviewee 3, for instance, reported developing personal goals: “I was the first person to do the tasks. Simply completing them first was important for me. So, I had to step in first and do it first so that I would not be influenced by other answers.” Interviewee 1 also pointed out learning gains other than English language proficiency and commented: “For me, it was also good for handling the airplane. It helped me improve my skills in terms of controlling and handling the aircraft more smoothly.” Finally, Interviewee 5 reported a very distinct contribution of the simulation sessions by referring to the decision-making skill: “Of course. It was helpful for me in making decisions. It is like making me feel much more professional because I am able to speak the language practically.” Considering all these occupational outcomes under five categories, it was concluded that the learning outcomes of the simulation-based pilotage training course were aligned with the occupational requirements.

# 3.2.2. Theme II communicative competence

The second theme identified in the qualitative content analysis of the interview data was labeled as communicative competence, and it included three categories, namely improved communication, improved vocabulary knowledge for effective communication, and variations in language use. Participants overall reported developing communicative competence by making use of the English language actively in the simulation sessions and by practicing the radio communication.

The instances of referral to improved communication were frequent. Interviewee 3, for instance, stated: “. so far, so good. I think it has been keeping us pretty sharp in specific phases of Aviation English, and that is good. Also, it was extremely helpful since we actively use English for communicating with the ATCOs” when he was asked about his perceived English language proficiency development during the course of a semester. In another instance, Interviewee 5 commented: “So, before the course, we had some basic understanding of communication, but not how to use the language while flying the aircraft . Therefore, I believe that I have improved my communication skill significantly.” This outcome was further highlighted by Interviewee 4 who noted:

Considering my own experience of using English for air traffic communication, this course was helpful to me. It was the only training I had. I learned the total composition of communication procedures. What to do and when to do . Yeah, that was good (Interviewee 4).

Finally, Interviewee 1 reported “It was kind of simulating the flight for real. The flights on the ground improve the communication part and getting familiar with all the procedures. It was kind of similar to flying a real aircraft” which was noted as another referral to the category of improved communication under the communicative competence theme.

Improved vocabulary knowledge for effective communication was the second category identified under the communicative competence theme. Interviewee 5, for instance, referred to this outcome by mentioning the vocabulary required to report nonroutine situations during a flight in the following excerpt:

I can say that it is always good to have some background knowledge related to emergency situations like knowing words, for example, related to the problems with the aircraft. I should be able to report it. This helps me a lot when communicating with the ATCOs in emergency situations (Interviewee 5).

Along similar lines with his friend, Interviewee 1 commented “I would like to say that it is quite beneficial. Why? Because verything you learn during the flight simulation will be right in front of you in the cockpit when you communicate with the ATCOs. herefore, it is practical since you use it already.”

Finally, variations in language use was the last category under the communicative competence theme. To begin with, Interviewee 2 commented: “I would like to say that throughout the tasks you were giving us, we were able to reach some specific communication from different accents in different airports with different kinds of requests, clearance, and stuff like that.” This comment highlighted the contribution of the simulation sessions to learners in terms of improving their communicative competence by being exposed to various instances of radio communication. It was further supported by Interviewee 1 who stated: “I have a similar opinion with my friend. It’s not all about standard phrases. If you are in an emergency situation, you should be able to explain your situation and understand the instructions of others who speak English in different accents.” These reflections showed that the simulation-based pilotage course improved student pilots’ communicative competence in many ways.

# 3.2.3. Theme III simulation as the cure for English speaking anxiety

The third theme identified in the qualitative analysis of the interview data was associated with the positive influence of simulation on student pilots to decrease their English speaking anxiety, which consisted of the following three categories:

signs of English speaking anxiety, impressions on the contribution of simulation to decreased English speaking anxiety, learning gains associated with English speaking anxiety.

The signs of English speaking anxiety among learners was a significant category noted under this theme. Interviewee 2, for instance, implied signs of English speaking anxiety and reported overcoming this problem by means of simulation:

From time to time, I hesitate to speak with someone in English. If I do not know the appropriate word, yes. However, I believe that I have changed. This course changed many things for me in terms of feeling better when talking to other people in English (Interviewee 2).

In another instance, Interviewee 1 mentioned the signs of English speaking anxiety in Turkish aviation context: “I believe that we do not have multiple opportunities in Turkey to communicate with other people who speak English well . We cannot practice the language enough before we start flying. This problem I think is about anxiety.” Another example of it among participants was noted based on the comments of Interviewee 4 who stated: “Maybe due to not knowing everything related to aviation, I was anxious. For me, during the initial part of training I couldn’t even recognize what he was saying . So, it was too hard.”

We also noted impressions on the contribution of simulation to decreased English speaking anxiety, which formed the second category under this theme. To illustrate, Interviewee 4 reflected on his overall experience of simultaneously flying the aircraft and communicating with the ATCO by highlighting how this experience influenced his anxiety in the following comment: “I think it was challenging. It was like . separating the task of controlling the aircraft and communication .. Then, you will get used to the ATCO and never worry about speaking English. When he talks, your mind just replies to him.” Along similar lines, Interviewee 2 mentioned overcoming it by the end of simulation sessions and commented:

From time to time, I feel hesitant when speaking with someone in English. If I don’t know the appropriate word, yes. However, I believe that I have changed. This course changed many things for me in terms of feeling better when talking to other people in English (Interviewee 2).

The third and last category under this theme was learning gains associated with English speaking anxiety. The references to this category included participants’ comments on how they perceived the simulation sessions as a facilitator to overcome it. Interviewee 5, for instance, commented: “The tasks encourage you to do the best performance. Because you show it up to other people. So, it is good for me to finally start speaking English for occupational reasons.” Similarly, Interviewee 2 reported:

I was also a little bit nervous to speak English because it was the first time that I used the simulator and made the communication. So, they were all new things for me. And, when you communicate you also need to handle the airplane . aviate, communicate . It was definitely challenging at first but then I overcame it (Interviewee 2).

Finally, Interviewee 4 exemplified learning gains associated with anxiety in the following excerpt: “. And, particularly when you are in the approach phase of the flight, things were more difficult due to the workload. However, this course provided the advantage of preparing myself in advance to speak more confidently.” Considering these statements, it was concluded that simulation was an effective tool and a cure for student pilots to decrease the English speaking anxiety thus becoming a skillful pilot.

# 3.2.4. Theme IV suggestions for improvement

The last theme identified in the qualitative analysis of the interview data was labeled suggestions for improvement, and four categories formed this theme: course design, crowded setting, suggestions for the readback performance tasks, suggestions for the simulation sessions. This theme, therefore, included student pilots’ comments regarding future improvements to the course as well as its current shortcomings.

Course design appeared as the first category in this theme. In this sense, participants, for instance, explicitly stated that the simulation-based pilotage training course should always be a part of the pilot training curriculum. The reflection of Interviewee 5 on this matter was as follows: “I really did not know anything before. This course should be a must-have course in the second year . in the first semester because we should learn these things before the start of the practice flights in the following semester.” Building on this statement, another participant commented: “There can be a separate Aviation Communication course dedicated to simulating radio communication (Interviewee 2). It was, therefore, concluded that students had varying opinions on whether including the radio communication within the simulation-based AE course or having another simulation-based course dedicated to this learning outcome.

On the other hand, participants met on common grounds regarding the number of students enrolled in this course, which created the second category in this theme, namely crowded setting. That is, they all reported for several reasons that class size should be decreased. While some students argued that they would develop an increased degree of self-awareness toward their shortcomings in this course if there were fewer students, others commented that they would be more encouraged, and the course would be more effective in decreasing anxiety. Interviewee 3, for instance, reported: “Definitely, the number of students should be decreased. It is too much. And, why decrease? We will get more feedback in the classroom and on the tasks. So, it will encourage me to give more.“. Interviewee 1, however, highlighted another reason by commenting “. it could be better if they decreased the student number. Because you do the simulation and the communication in a small group: it is going to be more effective, and I will understand what to improve.” These suggestions showed that the number of students enrolled in the course was a common concern for student pilots.

Suggestions for the simulation sessions were identified as the third category in this theme, and the time needed for familiarization with the hardware and the virtual aircraft used for instructional purposes were prominent issues according to student pilots. Accordingly, Interviewee 5 reported that familiarization with the aircraft itself was challenging: “I think getting familiar with the aircraft is a challenge because you cannot know the controls of all aircrafts. I mean the instrument panel, etc.” Similarly, Interviewee 1 commented: “I would like to say something related to the controls. I think that part is fine but there must be a separate rudder. At first, it seemed okay to use the sidestick and control the rudder. But then I realized that it was not that easy on the sidestick.”

Suggestions for the readback performance tasks constituted the fourth category of this theme. Student pilots’ implications regarding this category included getting instant and more feedback on these tasks. As such, Interviewee 3 commented: “Definitely, the number of students should be decreased. It is too much . We will get more feedback on the tasks. So, it will encourage me to give more, and I will understand what to improve.” Although this suggestion was partially related to the crowded classroom setting, it still highlighted the room for improvement in this simulation-based course. Building on this comment, Interviewee 5 stated that another feature should be added to the readback performance tasks: “We have tasks which are very useful.. but I think you need to add the true communication like the correct answer. And then I could see if I made a mistake, or I missed something.”

It was, hereby, concluded in the as good as it gets theme that these can be used as guidelines to improve the quality of learning for student pilots enrolled in the simulation-based AE course.

# 4. Discussion

The study’s findings shed light on several critical aspects of student pilots’ readback performance and AE vocabulary knowledge in a simulated environment.

After completing the course, the study revealed significant improvements in vocabulary knowledge among student pilots. This finding underscores the importance of comprehensive language training programs in enhancing pilots’ linguistic competence, as vocabulary proficiency plays a pivotal role in effective communication within the aviation domain. Extensive literature (Dinçer & Dinçer, 2021; Ghalebi, Sadighi, & Bagheri, 2020) emphasizes the critical role of robust vocabulary knowledge in ESP contexts, with vocabulary limitations posing a significant barrier to second language proficiency. Recent investigations have explored the efficacy of simulation technology in facilitating vocabulary learning, particularly in aviation contexts. Unlike prior studies utilizing tools such as Quizlet (Fursenko et al., 2021, pp. 118–127) or virtual reality (VR) (Madini & Alshaikhi, 2017), the present study innovatively employs Microsoft Flight Simulator to immerse student pilots in authentic aviation scenarios. Findings reveal a statistically significant improvement in student pilots’ vocabulary knowledge postsimulation sessions, highlighting the potential of simulation technology as an effective instructional tool.

According to Djaouti, Alvarez, Jessel, and Rampnoux (2011), serious games prioritize the acquisition of knowledge, skills, attitudes, or behaviors over entertainment, enjoyment, or fun, without necessarily directly relating to the game context. Michael and Chen (2005) define serious games as a digital game type that engages players, motivates them to learn or solve problems, and ensures their enjoyment. These definitions shed light on the educational and instructive components of serious games, particularly their potential as effective instruments for teaching and learning. Therefore, they can serve as simulations of real-life situations, providing students with authentic experiences that facilitate the practical application of their acquired knowledge in real-world contexts. Despite the scarcity of studies focusing on the utilization of serious games for AE teaching, the comparative analysis with a prior study emphasizes the unique contribution of serious games to AE learners. In a military aviation context, a recent study by Dinçer and Dinçer (2021) demonstrated the effectiveness of serious gaming in enhancing vocabulary acquisition. Similar to Dinçer and Dinçer (2021), the present study concluded that serious games, namely the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 in this study, were effective instructional tools in a civil aviation context. Serious games, in particular, helped student pilots improve their aviation English vocabulary knowledge and thus attain the language skills defined in the ICAO LPR. In addition, this study extends the research into serious games since the insights gleaned from simulation-based instruction by means of a serious game have, for the first time, shed light on its potential to address the specific language needs of student pilots, offering a novel approach to aviation English instruction.

Despite promising findings, gaps persist in our understanding of the relationship between serious gaming and language acquisition in ESP contexts. While prior studies have explored the impact of serious games on language proficiency and subject knowledge in maritime (Pappa & Papadima-Sophocleous, 2019), finance (Popescu, Romero, & Usart, 2013), and history (Chen et al., 2019), limited research exists on their application in aviation English instruction. The integration of the Microsoft Flight Simulator serious game into the aviation English learning setting has shown outstanding potential as a viable substitute for conventional teacher-led instruction in the Turkish aviation setting. Previous research has shown that there is a big problem with the English language skills of student pilots in Turkey (Demirdöken & Okur, 2023) This study confirmed that serious games work well in educational settings, which helps us learn more about the role of simulations and serious games in aviation English learning environments.

The present study also addressed student pilots’ readback performance, examining the multi-phased process involved in responding to ATCOs. This process entails listening to, comprehending, processing, and subsequently responding to ATCO instructions, all while maintaining control of the aircraftda task demanding both cognitive and motor coordination. Particularly challenging for student pilots, it underscores the necessity for tailored learning opportunities to enhance readback proficiency within authentic aviation contexts. The study adopts a robust methodology to evaluate student pilots’ readback performance, notably filling a gap in existing literature by providing reliable insights into this domain. The robustness of our methodology lies in the fact that our research replicates real-world flight scenarios and readback procedures employing the flight simulation software for instructional purposes and that it can be adapted to various AE learning settings. Throughout a semester, students receive theoretical training on communication protocols and engage in simulated flight scenarios, covering ground, air, and post–landing communications. By aligning course content with real-world aviation practices, the study ensures the fidelity of the data collected, offering valuable insights for aviation English instructors and flight trainers.

This investigation pioneers research into student pilots’ readback performance, shedding light on an underexplored area. While prior studies have acknowledged the importance of effective readback for aviation safety, recent research has been scarce. The study builds upon earlier work, notably examining the impact of message complexity and length on readback accuracy. Despite previous contributions, contemporary reports on this matter are limited, underscoring the significance of the study’s findings. The study’s outcomes underscore the importance of understanding and addressing challenges related to readback performance in aviation contexts. Through innovative methodologies, including flight simulation tools, the study demonstrates tangible improvements in student pilots’ readback proficiency, aligning with ICAO language proficiency standards. High inter-rater reliability and positive feedback from student pilots further validate the effectiveness of simulation-based training in enhancing readback performance, making a significant contribution to the field of aviation English instruction.

The qualitative analysis of interview data yielded several key themes that provide valuable insights into the experiences and perceptions of student pilots participating in a simulation-based AE course. Participants unanimously recognized the direct alignment between the simulation-based AE course and the skills essential for employment in the aviation industry. Notably, participants emphasized the importance of effective communication with ATCOs during flight operations. Interviewee 4 echoes this sentiment by emphasizing the importance of mastering communication protocols before entering the cockpit. Similarly, Interviewee 1 emphasized the practicality of the course, as the skills learned during simulation sessions directly translate to real-world scenarios in the cockpit. These reflections underscore the relevance of the course content to future occupational requirements, validating the effectiveness of the training program in preparing student pilots for their careers.

Participants reported significant changes in communicative competence, attributing these improvements to active English language use and practice within the simulation-based AE course. Interviewee 3 highlighted the role of the AE course in sharpening specific phases of aviation English, emphasizing its practical application in communicating with ATCOs. Additionally, participants recognized the course’s contribution to enhancing their understanding of communication procedures and aviation-related vocabulary. These reflections underscore the multifaceted nature of communicative competence development within the context of aviation training, emphasizing the importance of practical experience and language proficiency in facilitating effective communication.

Foreign language anxiety acts as an emotional filter that inhibits the pupil’s response to spoken information (Krashen, 1980). That is, experiencing elevated levels of anxiety hinders learners’ ability to effectively process and respond to spoken information in the target foreign language. Similarly, EFL learners often view speaking as the most challenging of the four language skills (Akkakoson, 2016), and researchers frequently report speaking anxiety in class (Mak, 2011). In this regard, English language learners in the AE classrooms may also experience increased anxiety, which has an impact on their speaking performance. Given that anxiety has a substantial impact on speaking ability, it is crucial to provide specific attention to addressing this issue with student pilots who consider speaking English as a distinct reason to learn aviation English. Despite studies on ESL and EFL learners’ English-speaking anxiety (Akkakoson, 2016; El-Sakka, 2016; Mak, 2011; Suleimenova, 2013), the literature lacks solid research findings on innovative solutions to overcome this issue among student pilots. Demirdöken and Okur’s (2023) study stands out as one of the few that examined English speaking anxiety among student pilots in Turkiye. The study’s findings demonstrated that it was a significant issue in the Turkish context. Given this recent finding, the use of serious gaming to help student pilots overcome speaking anxiety has been a noteworthy contribution of the present study. The qualitative analysis in the present study revealed that simulation has a positive impact on reducing student pilots’ speaking anxiety. Interviewees expressed how they overcome anxiety through exposure to simulated flight scenarios, with Interviewee 4 noting the gradual transition from apprehension to confidence in communication. Participants viewed simulation as a catalyst for enhancing both linguistic and piloting skills, highlighting its role in alleviating anxiety and fostering a sense of preparedness for real-world flight operations. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of simulation-based training in mitigating psychological barriers to effective communication and performance in aviation contexts.

Participants provided valuable feedback on potential improvements to the simulation-based AE course, emphasizing the importance of course integration within the pilot training curriculum. Additionally, participants expressed concerns regarding class size and the need for more personalized feedback and instruction. Suggestions for improvement included reducing class size and enhancing familiarization with simulation hardware and virtual aircraft controls. These insights highlight opportunities for enhancing the quality and effectiveness of simulation-based AE training, ensuring alignment with student needs and expectations.

In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the effectiveness of simulation-based AE training in addressing English speaking anxiety and improving vocabulary knowledge among student pilots. The identified themes underscore the course’s efficacy in preparing student pilots for the challenges of aviation communication and highlight areas for further refinement and improvement to optimize training outcomes. These findings also contribute to our understanding of the factors influencing language proficiency and communication skills in aviation contexts, emphasizing the importance of tailored training programs to meet the unique linguistic demands of aviation professionals.
