Assessed writing quality

The current study investigated the relationships among large-grained and fine-grained aspects of absolute syntactic complexity (SC) and expert-assessed writing quality of 446 argumentative writing samples of college-level Chinese EFL learners. Computational indices tapping into largegrained and fine-grained aspects of absolute SC were computed by TAAssC and L2sCA. Drawing upon rigorous SEM analyses, this paper demonstrated the utility of computational indices that tap into absolute SC. Overall, the measurements of absolute SC accounted for $4 2 \%$ of the variance in human-judged overall writing scores. The results revealed that (1) noun phrase (NP) complexity was the underlying cause that determined trained raters' judgement on argumentative writing quality; (2) among traditional large-grained indices, MLC, CN/C, and CN/T, were dependable metrics in representing SC and predicting writing quality; (3) among fine-grained indices, prepositional phrases and relative clauses as noun modifiers were prominent in representing NP complexity; (4) relative clause and adjectival modifiers had unique and complementary effects to large-grained NP complexity in affording explanations for human judgement; (5) the use of prepositions in NP was the most prominent contributor to the increase of large-grained NP complexity among the noun phrase modifiers in this specific corpus. Situated in previous research, the results provide an opportunity to evaluate L2 writing within the theoretical framework of absolute syntactic complexity.

# 1. Introduction

Writing requires multi-faceted competence and is a key construct in language asessment (Norris & Ortega, 2009). In second language (L2) writing reearch, there has ben increased atention from researchers towards the construct of L2 complexity in writing assesment. Various dimensions of textual features of L2 complexity have been explored, ranging from lexical level (e.g., Peng et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2018) to syntactic lel (.g., Kyle & Crossley, 2018) and discourse lvel (i.e., cohesion; e.g., Crossey et al., 016)

Among these aspects, the importance of syntactic features has been recognized by empirical investigations over the past two decades (e.g., De Clercq & Housen, 2017; Housen & Kuiken, 2009; Lu, 2011). Syntactic complexity refers to the degree of variation, elaboration, and sophistication of the grammatical structures used in language production (Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998; Housen & Kuiken, 2009; Lu, 2011). Bulte and Housen (2012) made distinction between absolute complexity and relative complexity. Absolute syntactic complexit is concerned with objective inherent properties and text-internal formal characteristics of inguistic units, while relative syntactic complexity refers to the degree of cognitive difficulty of processing syntactic tructures as perceived relative to other structures, which addresses the developmental sequences of syntactic features. Useful insights into yntactic complexity (SC) has been afforded by the automatic measurement of traditional (large-grained) features (Lu, 2010; Lu, 2017) and fine-grained features (Kyle, 2016; Kyle & Crossley, 2017, 2018) and the investigations into the utilit of them (Lu, 2011; Kyle et al., 2021; Lei et l., 2023; Li & Yang, 2023).

Among these investigations, a bulk of extant studies are dedicated to the exploration of large-grained SC indices. Although studies have largely undercored the effects of them in predicting writing qualit e.g. Lu, 2011; Taguchi et al., 2013; Yang et a., 2015; Bi & Jiang, 2020), large-grained features are prone to mixing independent and unrelated sources of SC (Bulte & Housen, 2012), under-representing the multi-faceted nature of this critical construct (Kyle, 2016), and losing linguistic interpretability (Biber et al., 2020). The recent development and proliferation of fine-grained syntactic indices is a desirable movement in that they represent specific syntactic structures and thus are more specific and sensitive to capture detailed information about syntactic development. Nonetheles, despite the multipleadvantages f fine-grained features, whether it i necessary to adopt a fine-grained aproach for every aspect of syntactic complexity remains unclear. Extensive fine-grained indices were discarded in preliminary analysis for their non-normality, because some specific syntactic structures occurred extremely rarely in learner texts (Kyle, 2016). These results indicate that for certain aspects of SC, grouping features into largergrained categories sems more appropriate. Hence, it i critical to pinpoint the position where the measurement of different aspects of SC should be situated in the granularity continuum.

Moreover, despite the centralit of SC in writing asessment, very litte is known about the inter-relationships between different aspects of this key construct. Computational linguists have been developing a growing body of fine-grained features to characterize syntactic usage. However, it remains to be seen whether these proliferated fine-grained indices measure distinct aspects of syntactic complexity and how they relate to traditional large-grained indices. It is believed that a solid understanding of the inter-relationships among the SC indices can provide important insights into L2 writing research.

Therefore, the current study intends to make a preliminary attempt to filter out useful large-grained and fine-grained SC indices for predicting human judgment of L2 writing quality, model the relationships among the sub-constructs of SC, and determine which finegrained indices would have unique and complementary effct to trdtional large-grained indices. To addressthe higher level of detal and specificity in analysi of detailed components, it may be more appropriate to adopt a fine-grained approach rather than grouping them into large-grained categories to ensure a more precise and nuanced understanding of syntactic complexity.

# 2.1. The granularity of SC measurement

In consistency with the taxonomy documented in recent studies (e.g., Kyle, 2016), this paper makes a distinction between large-grained and fine-grained indices within absolute SC. The isue f granularit regarding SC measurement is acontinuum: MLS and MLT are situated at the global, large-grained end; MLC, subordination, coordination, and traditional phraal elaboration measures (e. g., CP/C, CN/C) are more local and granular; while fine-grained phrasal and clausal measures provided by TAAssc are even more specific, representing the most fine-grained features on this granularity continum. Nevertheles, the more fine-grained the clasification of syntacticstructure is, the more likely it is to obtain a low number of instances in certain aspects. Give that, it iscitical to pinpoint the position where the measurements of different aspects of SC should be situated in the granularity continuum. To avoid confusion in terminology, traditional length-based, subordination, coordination, and phrasal sophistication indices provided by L2SCA's computation (Lu, 2010) which are more global are referred to as large-grained indices, while phrasal and clausal indices computed by TAAssc (Kyle, 2016) are more specific and they are referred to as fine-grained indices in this paper.

# 2.2. Large-grained absolute syntactic complexity (SC) and L2 writing

Various large-grained measures tapping into absolute SC have been proposed and investigated in L2 writing studies (e.g., Wolf e-Quintero et al., 1998; Ortega, 2003; Lu, 2011). Considering the labor-intensivenes of manual annotation (Lu, 2010) developed the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) to automatize SC analysis. L2SCA provides automatic computation of 14 consistently-used large-grained indices measuring 5 categories of absolute SC (Table 1).

Cross-sectional studies on SC in L2 English writing have generally confirmed the utility of the traditional large-grained indices that measure length of production unit and NP complexity as effective proficiency and quality indicators. Yang et al. (2015) revealed significant corrlations between length-based indices (MLS and MLT) and holistic scores of argumentative essays wrtten by intermediate-high and advanced graduate ESL learners. Meanwhile, they reported inconsistent correlations across topics between noun phrase complexity (MLC and CN/C), phrasal coordination (CP/C), and holistic writing quality, and thus they emphasized the potential efect of the writing topic in examining the predictive power of syntactic features. Lu (2011) investigated Chinese EFL learners' writing samples and reported significant correlations between learners proficiency levels and the density of complex nominals (CN/C, CN/T), length of production unit (MLC, MLS, MLT) coordination indices (CP/C, CP/T), whil subordination indices did not show a significant change across learners' language proficiency. Yoon (2017) investigated 7 large-grained measures obtained from L2SCA and unpacked significant differences acros proficiency levels in length of production unit (MLT, MLC, and MLS), noun phrase complexity (CN/C), and phrasal coordination (CP/C). In a more recent study by Jiang et al. (2019) on novice and intermediate Chinese EFL learners' narrative essays, two global syntactic measures (MLT and MLS) and a subordination measures (DC/C) were revealed as beter indicators of writing proficiency level. Investigating the same corpus, Bi and Jiang (2020) suggested that among the seven large-grained L2SCA measures adopted by Yon (2017), MLS, CN/C, and C/T were efective indicator of holistic writing scores. Zhang and Lu (2022) provided further evidence by investigating writing samples of collegiate Chinese EFL leaners across two genres, i.e., application lettrs and argumentatie essays. Their results underscored the prominence of noun phrase omplexit by discovering a consistently larger predictive power of CN/C compared to large-grained clausal features (e.g, MLS, MLC) across two genres, while DC/C measuring clausal subordination was only reliable in predicting holistic writing scores of application lettr. As far as argu. mentative essays are concerned, their results revealed meaningful positive correlations $( r > 0 . 1 0 0$ $p < 0 . 0 5$ between holistic scores and traditional syntactic indices including CN/C, MLC, and CP/C.

Longitudinal research which attempts to track and gauge L2 learners' English writing development has suggested a positive and significant correlation between partial large-grained indices and time. Kyle et al.(2021) investigated the role of two length-based syntactic features (MLT, MLC) and three features measuring noun phrase complexity (CN/C), coordination (CP/C), and subordination (DC/C) in the longitudinal L2 writing development of low intermediate (CEFR-A2) L1 Dutch ESL learners over two years. They found meaningful developmental trends for two measures among the five: DC/C, MLT. However, this study did not control for the genre and topic efects. Following the selection of syntactic indices in Kyle et al. (2021), Kl e al. (2023) tracked the development of upper-intermediate to advanced Catalan/Spanish-English bilinguals by analyzing their weekly diaries over 12-17 weeks. Different from the results documented in Kyle et al. (2021), Koylui et al. (2023) observed a significant negative relationship between time and VP/T (measuring verb phrase coordination), whilethe other five indices did not demonstrate significant change. The discrepancy in the results might be attributed to the difference in the duration of the investigations, writing genre, and the proficiency levels of the participants. In another ongitudinal study conducted by Bulte and Housen (2014), the evolution of ESL writing was characterized by a significant development in phrasal SC but a lack of development in subordination over one semester of the EAP course. However, their results were obtained from a relatively short period and thus may not fuly capture the dynamic and evolving nature of SC development over time.

Studies have revealed differential explanatory power of syntactic indices at the clausal and phrasal levels in L2 English writing proficiency. For example, Yoon (2017) unpacked significant dfference across proficiency levels in large-grained SC at the phrasal but not clausal level. Zhang and Lu (2022) also revealed that phrasal indices (CN/C) had a stronger explanatory power than clausal indices (MLS, MLC) in predicting L2 writing quality across two genre (application leters and argumentative essays). Longitudinally, Maz. gutova and Kormos (2015) demonstrated that intermediate L2 learners improved phrasal SC while clausal SC in academic writing remained stable in an intensive EAP course over one month. In another longitudinal study, Bulte and Housen (2014) found ESL academic writing development was characterized by asignificant increase in phrasal SC while clausal SC (subordination) remained stable over one semester of an EAP course.

To reiterate, a recurring theme merging from extant studies findings is that among large-grained indice, production-unit indices (MLT, MLC, MLS) and indices tapping into noun phrase (NP) usage (e.g, CN/C) prominently and consistently characterize L2 writing quality and longitudinal writing development (e.g, Zhang & Lu, 2022; Bi & Jiang, 2020). Measures of clausal subordination (e.g, DC/C) were partially revealed as useful in predicting L2 writing proficiency (Zhang & Lu, 2022) and the development of novice and intermediate L2 writers (e.g,Kyle et al., 2021; Jiang et a., 2019). Similarl, phrasal coordination (CP/C) were partially found to be significantly correlated with L2 writing proficiency (Zhang & Lu, 2022; Yoon, 2017; Lu, 2011) and the development f novice and intermediate 2 writers (Kyl et al., 2021). However, these two indices were not efective in predicting the writing quality of advanced writers (Taguchi et al., 2013) and certain genres such as argumentative writig (Zhang & Lu, 2022). Additionally, phrasal indices were consistently found to be more useful than clausal indices in measuring writing proficiency (Zhang & Lu, 2022; Yoon, 2017) and development (Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Bulte & Housen, 2014).

Nonetheles, recent studies have highlighted the inadequacy of large-grained indices in representing SC in learner texts for their insensitivity in capturing specific structures. Large-grained indice have been argued to obscure independent and unrelated sources of SC (Bulte & Housen, 2012) and confound linguistic characteristics that are functionally distinct (Biber et al., 2016). Given that, attention should be increasingly paid to more fine-grained measurements. Fine-grained features have the potential to complement large-grained measurements by affording detailed information on the emergence of specific syntactic structures.

# 2.3. Fine-grained absolute syntactic complexity (SC) and L2 writing

Building upon recent advances in computational linguistics and natural language procesing (NLP), Kyle (2016) automatized fine-grained syntactic analysis in Tool for the Automatic Assessment of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAAssc). The fine-grained indices capture absolute SC at clausal and phrasal levels. Clausal complexity indices measure from two perspectives: the average number of particular structures per clause and its standard deviation I alignment with the documented prominent role of NP in characterizing writing quality (Biber et al., 2011; Lu, 2011; Diez-Bedmar & Perez-Paredes, 2020), a vast amount of fine-grained indices in TAAssc tap into NP complexity. A detailed operationalization of fine-grained clausal and phrasal indices can be found in Kyle (2016, p. 54-58).

The main contribution of fine-grained clausal and phrasal measures is their capability to probe into the usage of particular structures by separating the counting of each type of syntactic structure instead of grouping structures into an omnibus. The fine. grained approach is particularly potent in addressing the granularity ssue as it does not obscure independent and unrelated sources of SC. Thus, combining large-grained with fine-grained measurements has the potential to ful represent the multi-faceted nature of absolute SC while maintaining linguistic interpretability.

Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on SC in L2 English writing have attempted to unpack the relationships between fine-grained indices and L2 writing qualit. Kyle and Crossley (2018) studied argumentative essays and revealed fine-grained indices measuring phrasal and clausal complexity as efective predictors of holistic writing qualit, with phrasal complexity being a better writing proficiency indicator than clausal complexty and traditional large-grained indices. Similarl, Zhang and Lu (2022) compared the predictive power of traditional global and fine-grained syntactic indices in predicting holistic writing quality. Their resuls unpacked a consstently larger predictive power for fine-grained indices in TAAssc than for tradtional large-grained features provided by L2sCA across two genres (for application letters: $3 1 . 9 ~ \%$ vs. $2 0 . 2 ~ \%$ For argumentative essays: $3 0 . 6 ~ \%$ vs. $1 5 . 7 ~ \%$ . The most effective fine-grained indices $( r > 0 . 2 0 0 )$ were related to preposition complexity (prepositions per clause), prepositional NP complexity (prepositions per object of the preposition), general NP complexity (dependents per nominal, dependents per nominal subject) adverbial modifiers (adverbial modifiers per clause), and adjectival NP complexity (adjectival modifiers per nominal, adjectival modifiers per nominal). Notably, the effective fine-grained indices were predominantly related to NP complexity.

Among multiple fine-grained aspects of syntactic complexity, NP complexity has been regarded as critical in featuring writing proficiency (e.g., Biber et al., 2011; Lu, 2011). For example, in Crossley and McNamara (2014), fine-grained indices related to NP modification was found to have relationship with asessed writing qualit of timed descriptie essays. Addressig a higher level of detail and specifity in analysis of detailed components, Casal and Lee (2019) revealed that the number of adjective, participle, and preposition modified nominal phrases is linked to higher instructor asessment of advanced level L2 learners' writing quality. In addition, Diez-Bedmar and Perez-Paredes (2020) highlighted the utility of NP complexity in differentiating the L2 English writing samples of Spanish EFL secondary schoo learners across 4 grades. Their study underscored the role of premodifying slots in the development of NP complexfication. Similarly, i, and Lin, Liu et al. (2023) also found that complex NP with modifiers is predictive of human-rated levels of request letters and self-recommendation leters composed by Chinese EFL learners. As for longitudinal en. deavors, Staples, Gray, Biber, and Egbert (2022) studied the relationships betwen fine-grained SC indices of undergraduate students academic writing and their year of study. They demonstrated that L1 and L2 English writers used more phrasal features measuring NP complexity and les clausal features measuring the use of omplement and adverbial clause from the first year to the fourth year f ther graduate study. More specificall,L1 English writers exhibited a consistent growth in the utilization of specific phrasal features including atributive adjectives, premodifying nouns, nominalizations, and head nouns with multiple premodifiers, whileL2 English writers showed a fairly steady increase in the use of nominalization and a certain degre of growth in atributive adjectives and of? prepositional phrases with the correlation coefficients being above 0.10. Crossey and McNamara (2014) also reported a significant increase in the number of modifiers per noun phrase over the duration of a semester.

Although large-grained and fine-grained computational indices hold promise for representing writing proficiency and quality, a key challenge in automatic computation is the accuracy of syntactic parsing. Current NLP techniques often fall short of perfect acuracy, particularly when analyzing learner texts, as the dependent POS-taggers and syntactic parser are not developed to navigate L2 learners textual dat in the first place. Studies have shown that automatic text analysis tols perform not as well on unedited learner texts as on native corpus data (Lu, 2010; Gilquin & Granger, 2015). As is reported in Lu (2010), whil some complexity indices computed by L2SCA demonstrated strong correlations with the results of human annotation in a random subset of a large corpus of collegiate Chinese EFL leaners writing data (MLT: 0.987; C/T: 0.961), others such as MLC (0.932), T/S (0.919) and CN/C (0.867) showed less satisfactory correlation coefficient.Similarl, Yoon and Polio (2017) reported reliability scores of 0.81 between L2SCA and 30 manually coded ESL writing esays of advanced level, with the reliabilit f T/S (0.74) indicating significant measurement eror. As for fine-grained SC indices, few studies reported accuracy scores of the indices extracted by TAAssc, but the accuracy rate of the dependent parser is reported as $9 0 ~ \%$ (Kyle, 2016), indicating that the accuracy of this tool is still not perfect. Given the issue of measurement eror in the current automatic text analysis toos, it i highly suggested to draw upon the Structural quation Modeling (SEM) method because it allows for an estimation of measurement err and produces a more reliable specification of latent constructs utilizing multiple observed indicators (Kline, 2018).

# 2.4. Research

Firstly, extant literature has not yet systematically examined the factor structure of valid SC measures in predicting writing quality It remains to be seen whether recently proliferated indices are distinct or redundant in measuring aspects of SC.

Secondly, very littl is known about the inter-relationships between different aspects of SC to grant a comprehensive and systemic operationalization of SC appealed for by Lu (2017). Studies exploring the relationships between large-grained and fine-grained absolute measures are scarce.

Thirdly, few studies attempted to addressthe ssue of measurement error commonly existing in the current automatic text analysis tools. There remains a need for improved representation of the target constructs in SC and more accurate modeling of the in. terrelationships between indices.

# 3. The current study

To address the extant research gaps, the current study seeks to be one of the initial attempts to unpack the factor structure of absolute SC, model the relationships among its sub-constructs, and reveal their relative predictive power. Accordingly, this study is guided by the following research questions:

(1) What are the relationships between large-grained indices of absolute SC and human judgement on overall writing quality? (2) What are the relationships between fine-grained indices of absolute SC and human judgement on overall writing quality? (3) What are the relationships between fine-grained and large-grained indices of absolute SC? To address the measurement error in the automatic processing of learner texts, ths study intends to draw upon the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method to precisely model the rlationships. SEM produces a more eliable pecification of latent constructs by utilizing multiple observed indicators. In SEM, the latent variable could reflect true scores that are not biased by measurement error (Kline, 2018).

# 4. Methodology and results

# 4.1. Learner corpus

The learner corpus comprises 46 argumentatie essays by 223 L1 Chinese EFL learners randomly selected from the International Corpus Network of Asian Leaners of English (INALE, Ishikawa, 2013, 2018). The training set comprises 20 writing samples, and the other 226essays served as the testing set to validate the generalizability of the model. Each participant responded to two independent prompts in 200 to 300 words. The participants were asked to give and defend their opinions with reasons and arguments on two topics: (1) It is important for cllee students to have a part-time ob (PTJ) (2) Smoking should be completely anned at all restaurants inthe country (SMK). The participants were required to complete the writing tasks in 20 to $4 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and were not allowed to use references. Their language proficiency levels ranged from CEFR A2 to ${ \bf B } 2 / { \bf B } 2 + { \bf \Delta }$ (higher than B2). The corpus provides the CEFR-linked proficiency bands based on the participants' scores in standardized high-stakes English proficiency tests such as TOEFL and TOEIC and the standard L2 vocabulary sizetest by Nation and Beglar (2007) of the top 5000 words. The mapping scheme i displayed in Table 2.

# 4.2. Human Scoring

The current study opted for the analytic scoring pproach because i produces scores with higher inter-rater reliability than holistic scoring. Analytic scoring allows the rating criteria to be focused on relevant constructs, failitates the calibration of rater traning, and enables raters to distinguish and focus on one construct at a time (Knoch, 2009; ast, 2009). This study chose Jacob's ESL Composition Profile (Jacob et al., 1981) as the coring rubric because it along with its adaptations is one of the most widely used analytic rubrics in writing research for asessing the writing abilities of non-native speakers of English e., Crossey & McNamara, 2014; Connor-Linton & Polio, 2014; Taguchi et al., 2013). This rubric assessed five different analytical features of writing: content, organization, vocabulary, language use, and mechanics. There are four bands for each dimension: scores range from 1-3 for very poor, 46 for fair to poor, 7-9 for good to average, and 10-12 for excellent to very good. The Content dimension aseses the quality and depth of the content and higher cores in this dimension indicate a more knowledgeable, substantive, and well-developed thesis relevant to the assigned topic. The Organization dimension evaluates the structure and coherence of the writing. Higher scores in this dimension indicate fluent expression, clear and well-supported ideas, logical sequencing, and cohesive writing. The Vocabulary dimension focuses on the range and appropriatenes of vocabulary use. Asophistcated range of vocabular, effective word choice, and appropriate register would be assigned higher scores. The Language Use dimension asesses the effctivenessof the use of complex constructions and accuracy of language structures. The Mechanics dimension focuses on the mastery of language conventions. After analytic scoring, the analytic ratings were combined into an overall weighted score for each essy using the following formula proposed by Jacobs et al. (1981): Overall Weighted Score $=$ Content Score/ $1 2 ^ { * } 3 0$ +Organization Score/ $^ { 1 2 ^ { * } 2 0 }$ +Vocabulary Score/ $^ { \prime } 1 2 ^ { \ast } 2 0$ +Language Use Score/ $^ { \prime } 1 2 ^ { \ast } 2 5$ $^ +$ Mechanics Score/ $^ { \prime } 1 2 \ ^ { * } 5$ Of interest for the current study is the overall scores and the scores of Language Use. The Language Use score aseses the efectivenessof the useof complex constructions and thus primarily relates o syntactic complexity. Given that, we used the Language Use score for the purpose of rigorous index selection. Of note, the Language Use dimension also evaluates grammatical accuracy besides the complexity of constructions. Given that, the Language Use dimension is connected to syntactic complexity but i not limited to it (i., it als relates to grammar, morphology, and the lexicon), so we did not use this score separately for further analysis. A complete rating scale is provided in Appendix A.

The learner texts were scored independently by trained raters using the ESL Compositional Profile (Jacobs et al., 1981). The first rater is an experienced L1 English EFL teacher with teaching experience of at least 5 years. The second and third raters are novice Chinese high-school EFL teachers with Cambridge Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults and master's degree in Applied Linguistics. They had been trained to score argumentative essays with the Jacobs ESL Composition Profile Jacob et al., 1981). A 60-minute training sesson was conducted prior to formal scoring to clarify the purposes and procedures of the rating process to ensure unanimous understanding of the rubric, and familiarize the raters with the rubric. First, the raters were given the writing rubric, writing prompts, and 5 writing samples with varying analytic scores. These writing samples served as benchmark performances and were llustrated and disussed. Second, in thetria rating session, the raters independently rated 10 writing samples. Any high-conflict cases with scoring discrepancies over 2 points in any of the five sub-dimensions were discussed to resolution. In formal scoring, the testing set f the writing samples was scored independently by the three raters, and the training set was scored independently by the second and third raters. Table 2 displays the distribution of the participants' proficiency levels and writing scores.

# 4.3. NLP tools and text processing

To obtain the syntactic indice, TAAssc (Kyle, 2016) was used to compute the fine-grained syntactic indices, and L2SCA (Lu, 2010) embedded in TAAssC was used to compute the traditional large-grained SC indices.

Since extant iterature has not yet systematically examined the relative power of fine-grained indices in explaining human-rated writing qualit, the current study follows an exploratory data-driven approach in filtring out indice of utility, whil factor structure specification was informed by conceptual underpinning. To conduct exploratory data-driven analysis, full range of the indices was employed. Considering the potential for pronouns as phrases to skew counts of dependents, the indices calculated by excluding pronoun noun phrases were also included, resulting in 31 fine-grained indices tapping into clausal complexity and 66 fine-grained indices tapping into phrasal complexity (Kyle, 2016, p. 54-58).

# 4.4. Statistical analysis and results

The programs used in this study were IBM sPs 23.0 for correlation analysis and IBM AMOs 23. for structural equation modeling. To estimate overall writing quality, the weighted scores independently given by the thee raters were used as observed variables to estimate the factor that rflets the true score of overallwiting qualit. The correlations between the scores given by the three raters demonstrated satisfactory inter-rater reliability (Table 3).

# 4.4.1. Index selection

Index selection follows an explanatory approach. First, the normality of indices was checked: any indices with skewnes and kurtosis values between $^ { - 2 }$ and $^ { + 2 }$ were deemed to indicate normal distributions (George & Mallery, 2010). Any indices that were not normally distributed were excluded from further analysis. Pearson corrlations were then conducted on the remaining variables to determine whether they were meaningfully correlated with the analytical scores on the Language Use. Indices that did not show meaningful correlations with the scores were discarded ( $\cdot \vert r \vert < . 1 0 0$ , the threshold value for small effects, Cohen, 1988). Table 4 provides the correlations between the remaining variables and the analytical scores on language use. Informed by theoreical underpinnings,the remaining variables were subsequently grouped under diffrent constructs acording to their connotations (see the next section)

# 4.4.2. Model construction

The current study adopted a confirmatory approach in specifying the model structure. The grouping of indices and connotations of constructs are demonstrated in the first column of Table 4. Pearson corrlation analyses were conducted within each construct to examine the degree of homogeneity and inter-relatedness of indices and the aropriateness toutilize them as indicators to estimate latent variables (Tables 6-9). In common practice, adequate correlations among the observed measures were required to define a latent construct (Kline, 2018). In this paper, the range of correlation coefficients within the same hypothesized construct was set between 0.30| and $| 0 . 9 0 |$ to ensure convergent validity for the latent construct while maintaining discriminant validity for the observed measures (Costello & Osborne, 2005; Tabachnick & Fidell 2013). For each pair of indices that were highly corrlated $( | r | > . 9 0 )$ , only the one with a higher correlation with the language use scores was retained.

Selected large-grained indices were moderately and strongly correlated ( $\dot { \boldsymbol { r } }$ ranges from.560 to.824, $p < . 0 5 \AA$ (Table 5). Judging from the high co-variation between MLC and CN/C, MLT and CN/T $( r = . 8 0 8$ $p < . 0 1$ $r = . 8 2 4 _ { \cdot }$ $p < . 0 1 \AA$ , this paper argues that NP complexification was the underlying cause that drove the development of the length of production units and thus this factor was named large-grained NP complexity. The fine-grained indices measuring clausal complexity demonstrated significant correlations with an effect size ranging from small, moderate to extremely high $( r = . 2 1 1 - . 9 6 3$ $p < . 0 1 \cdot$ . To maintain distinctiveness between variables, auxpass per dl was discarded. The remaining indices were not convergent enough to indicate a common construct, and thus they were entered as exogenous variables. The indices measuring NP complexity by prepositional objects (av_pobj_deps and av_pobj deps_NN) were found to be sufficiently correlated $( r = . 8 5 3$ $p < . 0 1 $ . Three pairs of indices were found to be extremely highly correlated, indicating a lack of discriminant validity: av_ncomp_deps and av_ncomp_deps_NN $( r = . 9 8 3$ A $p < . 0 1 \AA$ , conj_and_all_nominal_deps_struct and conj_and_all_nominal_deps_NN_struct $( r = . 9 4 6$ $p < . 0 1 $ , and nsubj_pass_NN_stdev and nsubj_pass_stdev $( r = . 9 3 5 $ $p < . 0 1 \AA$ . Since these three constructs are defined by two observed variables, the variable with a higher correlation cofficient with human-rated scores in each construct was retained as exogenous variables in the structural model. For the constructs NP complexity by preposition in NP and NP complexity by relative clause modifier, two observed variables were retained afer removing homogeneous measurements.

Building on the results of index selection and factor structure specification, an SEM model was established with a structure demonstrated in Fig. 1. Hypotheses that indicate uni-directional predictions were made in SEM informed by theoretical underpinnings: (1) ll the variables that rereent distinct aspects of S would joiny predict the overall writing quality; (2) the fctors that represent fine-grained aspects of absolut S would influence the large-grained factor and hencforth predict overall writing qualit, beause the elaboration at the clausal and phrasal level would contribute to the increase in global indices measuring production unit length and the density of complex nominals. The model was evaluated based on five model fit indices: $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f }$ the comparative fit index (CFI), TuckerLewis index (TLI) oodnessf-fit index (GFI) austed goness-f-fit index (AGFI), inremental fit index (IFI), and ot mean square error of approximation (RMsEA). The initial model failed to meet the wellestablished criteria for model fit indices. Informed by modification indices and theoretical scrutiny, modifications were made. As for MLT and CN/T, and MLC and CN/C, their covariance was largely explained by the common underlying factor, and thus the variance remaining in the error term was correlated because it represented their shared production units in operationalization. Given that, their error terms were llowed to corrlate. Likewise for the pairs f CN/T and CN/C, their error terms were also allowed to correlate for their overlapped operationalization. The results indicated asatisfactory model it for the modified model (Table 9) and asignificant improvement in model fit compared with the initial model (Likelihood difference test for nested model comparison: $\Delta \chi ^ { 2 } { = } 8 3 9 . 6 0 3$ $\Delta \mathrm { d f } { = } 3$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ . Therefore, the modified model was considered as the final model (Fig. 1). The factors in the model were subsequently examined for multi-collinearit to avoid exaggerating standard erors for thestimates and to sure the distinctivenes of each indicator (Tabachnick & Fidel, 2013) Judging from the correlation matrix (see the supplemental files), the predictors did not demonstrate multi-collinearity $( | r | < . 7 0 )$ (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).

The mediation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between large-grained and fine-grained indices in predicting assesed writing quality. Considering that the normal sampling distribution of the indirect effct required by the Sobel test is usually violated, the current study adopted the bootstrpping method to identify indirect efects rather than Sobel test because the former has higher statistical testing power. The current study followed the criteria recommended by Baron and Kenny (1986) step by step in teting indirec effs Firs, indeendent variables significantly predted the dpedent variable whenthe mediatin factor is asent in the model i.., the ariables had significant total ffects). These variables include relative clause modifier complexity, preosition complexity, av ncomp deps NN, amod nsubj deps struct, and prep per cl (se Table 13). Second, the mediator significantly predicted the dependent variable. The assumed mediator in this paper, large-grained NP complexity, significantly predicted writing quality. Third, the independent variables significantly predicted the mediator (ie, the variables had significant indirec effts). These var iables include prepositional phrase complexity, av ncomp_deps NN, amod nsubj_ deps struct, and prep_per cl. They were deemed to exhibit meaningful mediation effects by large-grained NP complexity. Lastly, we examined whether the mediation effcts were partial or fll(i.e, whthr the dect ffcts wre igicnt. The reults donstrate siicnt fll medion efts f ained NP complexity on the relationship between overall writing quality and preposition complexity, av ncomp deps NN, and prep_per cl (insignificant direct ffects, Table 13), which indicated the inclusion of larg-grained NP complexity in the model considerably reduces the predictive power of prepositional phrase complexity. There was no mediation effct of large-grained NP complexity on the relationship between overall writing quality and relative clause modifier complexity and amod nsubj deps struct, which indicated these two fine-grained features had unique contributions to overall writing quality. The testing set generally replicated the results in the training set. Results of the testing set are provided in the supplemental files.

# 4.4.3. Multi-group SEM

Given the documented efect of within-genre topic on complexity developmental stages of L2 learners in argumentative writing (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Yang et al., 2015), we conducted a multi-group SEM analysis (i.e, prompt-specific analysis) to examine Whether the configure, the factor loadings, and the structural cofficints in the sEM model were equivalent across ifferent prompts. The samples were divided into two sub-groups according to the prompts: PTJ and SMK. As the participants wrote essays on both of the two prompts, the writing samples in the two sub-groups were produced by the same cohort of student writers.

First, the baseline modelassessed configural invariance of the model. Configural invariance connotes an equivalent factor structure of the model across groups. When asessing configural invariance in multigoup SEM, the model was estimated without imposing equality constraints on any parameters and with parameters being estimated together in the sub-groups. The model fit of the baseline model indicated configural invariance of the model across the sub-groups: $\chi ^ { 2 } { = } 3 8 1 . 7 4 1$ $\mathbf { d f } = 2 3 2$ $( \mathbf { p } < . 0 5 )$ $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 1 . 6 4 5 < 5 $ CFI $= 0 . 9 4 9 > 0 . 9$ ; RMSEA $= 0 . 0 5 4 < 0 . 0 6$ .

Second, constraints were imposed on the conceptual model step by step to evaluate increasingly rigorous validity of the model across subgroups. Each step involves estimating the model with one more constraint compared with the last step. The model estalished in the last step was the benchmark for comparison. The firt constraint concerns measurement invariance. If a model is demonstrated to have measurement invariance across groups, the factor loadings of each construct do not differ significantly across groups (i.e., the first section in Table 11 in the manuscript).

Model comparison was conducted between the model acceted in the first step (i.e., the model with configural invariance) and the model assuming the factor loadings of the constructs to be the same across the subgroups. A Chi-square dfference tes showed that the goodness-of-fit did not change significantly: $\Delta \chi ^ { 2 } { = } 7 . 8 5 9$ $\mathrm { d f } = 8$ $( p = . 4 4 7 )$ . Thus, the model is demonstrated have measurement invariance across the subgroups.

The second constraint concerns the equivalence of structural weights, i.e, the regression weights in the structural model that indicate the relationships between the constructs (see the second section of Table 11 in the manuscript). Model comparison was conducted between the model aceted in the second step (i.e., the model with measurement invariance) and the model assuming the structural weights to be the same across the subgroups. A Chi-quare ifference test showed that the oodnessof-fit did not change significantly: $\Delta \chi ^ { 2 } = 2 2 . 6 8 9$ $\mathrm { { d f } } = 2 3$ $\left( p = . 4 7 9 \right)$ . Thus, the model is demonstrated to have equivalent structural weights across the subgroups. In other words, the relationships between the constructs are the same across the subgroups.

So far, the multi-group SEM analysis has demonstrated that the model established in this paper exhibits srong invariance (con. figural, measurement, and structural weight invariance) across prompts within this specific corpus.

# 5.1. Large-grained absolute SC indices and writing quality

One of the most important indings of the current study is the prominent role of NP complexity (CN/C, CN/T) in representing raters judgment on argumentative writing quality in this specific corpus. Echoing Zhang and Lu (2022's results, this finding confirms the importance to pay greater atention to phrasal complexity in asssing L2 academic writing (Biber et al., 2011). Contradicting Yang et al. (2015)s findings of significant relationships between MLS and holistic argumentative writing scores, our results did not reveal significant correlations between MLS and asessed language use and overall writing qualit. onsidering the L2 writers in Yang et al. (2015) were graduate students with advanced proficiency level, this result appears to indicate a proficiency-based variation in the predictive effctivenessof sentence length. MLS was found to be les efective in predicting writig quality when the student writers with a wider range of proficiency lels as in the current corpus where trained raters' evaluation of writing quality was most srongly associatd wth the de f proction unit enth at a grular lel (i., clase), es trongly t til sigicany correlae wth T-unit length, whil not meaningfull associatd with sentence length (see Table 4). One of the possible explanation is that the student writers of beginning and intermediate writing proficiency are prone to misuse of coordination and subordination and the common grammatical mistake of run-on sentence, which contributes to a false increase in the index value of MLS in their writing samples. In such case, global ength-based measures, MLS in particular, fails to be reliable representation of writers ability to produce effective Iong units. n line with revious reearch (.g., Lei e al., 2023; hang & Lu, 2022; Lu, 2011; Yoon, 2017), this paper contends that MLC and indices measuring the density of complex NP are the most dependable large-grained metrics in predicting argumentative writing quality. Compared to MLS and MLT, MLC is more robust in its restance to syntacic naccuracy, eg., excesive and inaccurate use of coordination and subordination, run-on sentences, et., which results in a false increase in MLS and MLT while typically reflects immature writing proficiency in human raters judgement (see the example texts and Table 15 below on pages 41-42). Judging from the high co-variation between MLC and CN/C, as wel as MLT and CN/T (se Fig. 1), his paper argues that NP complexification was the underlying cause that drove the development of MLC/MLT se Table 14) and henceforth influenced trained raters' judgement on argumentative writing qualit. Aligning with Norrs and Ortea's (2009 claim that MLC can be usedto ssess phraal elaboration, our results substantiated that the construct that MLC measured was NP complexity and differed from MLS.

Our results did not reveal significant contributions by clausal subordination (e.g., CT/T, DC/c, Dc/T) and coordination (e.g., CP/T, T/S). Although this finding concurs with several previous results on argumentative writing (e.g., Lu, 2011; Yoon, 2017), some recent studies underpinned the utility of subordination and coordination features in evaluating narrative writing samples (e.g., Jiang e al., 2019; Bi & Jiang, 2020; Kyle et al., 2021). The discrepancy was speculated to be partiall caused by the difference in genre and language proficiency. This argument echoes Zhang and Lu (2022)'s discovery of the inconsistent predictabilit of subordination indices (DC/C) across genres, wherein DC/C was only reliable in predicting holistic writing scores of application leters rather than argumentative essays. The reasons underlying raters insensitivity to clausal coordination and subordination inthis specifi corpus as revealed by the insignificant contributions by clausal subordination (e.g., CT/T, DC/C, DC/T) and coordination (e.g., CP/T, T/S) can be attrbuted to the complexity developmental stages in L2 writing. Beginners, intermediate learners, and advanced learners typically progress through stages where coordination, subordination, and noun-phrase elaboration are developed respectively (Jiang t al., 2019; Ortega, 2015; Lu, 2011). College students with more than 10 years of English learning experience are expected to reach the third stage, where efective noun-phrase elaboration becomes a determining factor in distinguishing writing proficiency and influencing raters judgments. Anther explanation for the limited utility of subordination and coordination indices i thexcesive, inappropriat, and/or inaccurate use of thesestructures by student writers with limited proficiency. It was postulated that the falsely inflated values of MLS, subordination indices, and coordination indices due to inaccurate use of these syntactic structures are another explanatio for their limited ffets in characterizing leaners syntactic use. It was found that learner texts assigned lower scores in language use were featured by run-onsentences and inappropriate use of oordination and subordination (se Example Text 1 and 2).Such typicalerrors that are associated with lower writig proficiency and scores can result i falsely inflated values of clausal indice including MLS and indices measuring coordination and subordination. As reflected in the rubri, frequent erors in constructions were penalized by human raters. Compared with human raters, computational taggers and parsers are limited in discerning specific linguistic inadequacies, pinpointing the developmental stage where L2 learners typically trggle with such inadequacies, and thus are likely to be unsuccessul in affording differential penalizatio. Given that, developing and incorporating computational indices that quantify syntactic accuracy in flawed learner language are urgently warranted for their potential totremendously enhance the explanatory power of traditional large-grained indices. This finding indicates that fine-grained SC indices at the phraal level are more resistant to these typical errors, which makes them morereliable in distinguishing writing samples with a wide range of scores. This might explan for the larger predictive power of phrasal indices over clausal indices in measuring writing proficiency and development documented in existent studies (e.g., Zhang & Lu, 2022; Yoon, 2017; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Bulte & Housen, 2014).

# 5.2. Fine-grained absolute SC indices and writing quality

The efective fine-grained absolute SC indices that demonstrated meaningful correlations with assesed argumentative writing quality revealed in this study as shown in Table 4 have a large overlaping with those found in Zhang and Lu (2022). In the SEM model constructed i this study, the fie-grained SC formal features that have distinct total effets on asessed writig quality are related to phrasal complexity represented by relative clause modifiers (Rcmod complexity), adjectival modifiers (amod nsubj deps struct), preposition in NP (Prep. in NP Complexity, preposition per clause), nominal complements (av_ncomp_deps_NN).

The most important finding concerning fine-grained absolute SC is the prominent role of relative clause and preposition as noun modifiers in representing NP complexity in argumentative writing. Notably, the use of relative clause modifiers was prominent in prepositional objects, iven the high correlation coefficient between relative clause modifiers per nominal and relatie clause modifiers per object of prepositions $( r = . 6 2 3 , p < . 0 1 )$ . Given that academic writing requires prevalent use of NP to demonstrate formality (e.g., Biber e al., 2011) and this genre is most relevant to arumentative writing (Kyle & Crossley, 2017), incresing NP complexit via intensive use of post-noun-modifying prepositional phrases and relative clauses might be considered as benchmarks that indicate successful argumentative writing acquisition. This findings echoes with several existent studies that underscores the role of post-noun-modification by preositional phrases and relative clauses as reliable proficiency indicators eg., Jiang et al., 2019, Durrant & Brenchley, 2022 Li & Lin, Liu et l., 2023). The developmental stage of NP complexity of collegiate EFL leaners writing i found to be similar to the developmental pattern demonstrated in L1 English children's writing development (Durrant & Brenchley, 2022), wherein NP complexity increases are principall driven by post-modfication, especily relative clauses and proposition phrases. This finding also aligns with the positive correlation between high-school L2 learners writing proficiency and the frequencies of prepositional phrases and adjectival rlative clauses innarrative writings (Jiang et al., 2019). Similarl, Li, and Lin, Liu et al. (2023) also found that complex NP indicated by modifiers was predictive of human-rated levels f request leters and self-recommendation letters composed by Chinese EFL learners. However, whil also emphasizing the effectiveness of relative clauses and post-noun-modifying prepositional phrases as indicators of argumentative writing quality, Taguchi et al. (2013) found that high-rated argumentative essays contained significantl fewerelative clause ased on ther textual analysis of 54 texts. This reult can be attributd to the varying first languages of the participants and thir relatively high L2 proficiency (they graduated from an English-medium high school and were able fulfil the task requirement to write an 850-1300-word essay). Sarizing all the results it ppears that the occurrence of relative clauses as noun modifiers follows a U-curve pattern. Advanced writers may have transcended the developmental stage of NP modification and intentionally used effective atributie adjectives in place of relative clauses (Taguchi et al., 2013), while texts produced by high-intermediate writers at the later stage of NP modification development tend to use more relative clauses to create complex nominals. In contrast, beginning writers often lack the ability to produce such complex syntactic structures.

Concurring with Kyle and Crossley (2018)'s findings on TOEFL-independent essays as wel as Zhang and Lu (2022)'s results on college-level argumentative essays, our results also revealed phrasal complexity (e.g., Prmod complexity ${ \bf \Phi } _ { r } = { \bf \Phi } _ { \mathrm { ~ } }$ 342; Prep. in NP complexity=.263 (total effts) as a better writing qualit indicatr than clausl complexit ( rer191 (ttl effts). Furthermore, phrasal complexity was primarily achieved through the complexification of NP, as evidenced by the predominant role of complex nominals (CN/C, cN/T) and modifiers of nouns including relative clause modifiers, prepositional phrases. This is because academic writing heavily relies on nominalization and phrasal modification to condense information,convey abstract ideas, and construct arguments efficiently (Crossley & McNamara, 2014). Aligning with the more critical role of NP complexity than clausal complexity in asessing writing quality (Kyle & Crossey, 2018; Yoon, 2017) and gauging longitudinal writing development (Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015), the larger effect size f phraal complexity in our study was interpreted as a reflection of it uilit and robustnes in reresenting raters judgement.

Additionally, by examining the relationships between trained raters' scores and fine-grained SC indices, the current study contributed important insights into the developmental stages of noun modifiers in Chinese EFL learners, which expands the empirical evidence on the developmental progression index of NP modification (Biber et al., 2011). The developmental progression index of noun modification proposed by Biber et al. (2011) starts from pre-modification with adjectival attribute, to pre-modification with nouns and post-modification with concrete prepositional phrases with of and relative clauses, furthering to post-modification with abstract prepositional phrases with of and other prepositions and non-finite relative clauses. The increasing total effcts of noun modification by adjectival atributes prepositional phrases, and relative clauses discovered in this study aligned well with such developmental patern. The much smaller explanatory efectivenessof adjectival modifiers indicated that human raters rlied much less on adjectival atributes as pre-modifiers but regarded post-modifier (reositional phrase as modifier, relaive clause mdiers) as more important yardsticks. The researchers speculated that the raters assumed collegiate learners were at a higher stage of the developmental progression index of noun modification (Biber et al., 2011) and thus considered post-modifiers more effctive than pre-modifiers in distinguishing writing proficiency. The observed increasing pattern of the predictive efectivenessregarding NP modification also aligned with the developmental pattern of noun modifiers in Chinese high-school EFL students documented in Jiang et al. (2019, wherein noun modifirs utilized by high-schoo students progressively changed from pre-attributive to post-phrasal and post-clausal modifiers. The current study substantiated the utilit of the developmental progression index of noun modification as a valid proficiency indicator, and thus suggests that it should be explicitly expressed in rubrics and computerized in automatic text analysis tools.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the prompt-specific analysis (i.e., multi-group SEM analysis) did not yield significant difer ences in the relaionships between the aforementioned syntactic features and rated writing quality. Although i is documented in the L2 writing literature that the language of the prompt influences the syntactic features produced by L2 writing (e.., Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Yang et al., 2015), the two prompts in ths study did not affct the relationships between the syntactic features and raters judgement as far as this corpus is concerned. It may wel be that the trained raters were able to filter out the prompt language in thir evaluation and focus on the qualit of language that represent the current stat f learners interlanguage system. Raters' evaluations of language qualit likely include asessing the degree of syntactic complexit, as demonstrated by signficant features (e.g., relative clauses and prepositional phrases, which appears to be prompt-independent in this specific corpus of Chinese EFL collegiate writers with a wide range of proficiency, Raters appear to be able to extract such features as diffrentiating yardstcks and either explicitly or implicitly applied this knowledge to writing assessment.

# 5.3. The relationships between fine-grained and large-grained SC indices

Relative clause modifiers and adjectival modifiers of nominal subjects had significant direct while insignificant indirect efects in predicting asessed writing quality, demonstrting their complementary explanatory efect. Our findings revealed relative clause modifiers as the most robust indicator of syntactic complexity with an effect size (remod complexity $=$ 342) outweighing the large-grained factor Bage gained NP complexin $=$ 228). Resonating with the effectivenessof this feature documented in previous studies on argumentative writing (e.g., Taguchi et al., 2013) and acos diffrent genres (Jiang et al., 2019), this finding underscores the prominence of relative clause modifiers in representing rated writing quality. Although relative clause modifiers can lengthen T-units and increase complex nominal density, no mediation effect was found via the large-grained factor. The four large-grained indices measuring NP complexity are calculated by word counts and complex nominal incidences per production unit. The use of relative clause modifiers does not contribute to the increase of MLC but it increases the number of clauses while simultaneously increasing complex nominal density, which acounts for is unique and indrect explanatory ffects. Rgarding adjectival modfiers f nominal ubjects, their aility to lengthen production units is limited and they do not solely contribute to complex nominals density, which may account for the insignificant mediation effct. Relative clause modifiers and adjectival modfiers per nominal subject were found to provide distinctive explanatory power. These two indices can serve as effective fine-grained indices at the phrasal level to provide additie explanatory power and complement the large-grained indices in predicting asessed writing qualit. However, the full mediation (insignificant direct efects revealed in Table 13) of preposition per clause (prep_per cl), preposition in NP, and nominal complements (avn. comp_deps NN) by large-grained NP complexity indicates that the explanatory power of these fine-grained indices was fully subsumed under the large-grained factor. In other words, they have no complementary or addictive explanatory effects to large-grained NP complexity in predicting writing quality. Use of prepositions in NP and nominal complements contributes to the increase of large-grained NP complexity and influences human raters assessment only in an indirect way. Among the noun phrase modifiers the use of prepositions in NP was the most prominent contributor to the increase of large-grained NP complexity $( \beta = . 4 4 7 )$ . This indicates that the participants primarily used post-noun modifying prepositional phrase to achieve NP complexity, which corroborates our argument on page 44 that the collegiate larners were at a higher stage of the developmental progression index of noun modification

Biber et al., 2011) characterized by use of post-modifiers.

# 6. Conclusion, limitations, and future directions

The current study investigated large-grained and fine-grained aspects of absolute SC and asessed writing qualit of 446 argumentative essays of collegiate Chinese EFL learners. Through rigorous data-driven index selection and theory-grounded SEM model construction, this study demonstated the utility of computational indices that tap into absolute SC. Overall, asolute SC acounted for $4 2 \%$ of the variance in human-judged overall writing quality.

Among traditional large-grained indices, three indices (i.e., MLC, CN/C, CN/T) indicative of NP complexity were dependable metrics in predicting assssed overall writing qualit. Through examining inter-relationships between indices, this paper revealed NP complexity as the underlying cause that determined trained raters' judgement on argumentative writing quality. Among fine-grained measures, the current study underscored the prominent role of prepositional phrases and relative clauses as noun modifiers in rep. resenting NP complexity. Relative clause modifier was revealed as the most robust indicator in predicting human judgement on writing qualit. The current study highlihted its unique and complementary efect to large-grained indices of SC in affording explanations for human judgement. In conjunction with previous findings, the current research also substantiated the utility of the developmental progression index of noun modification (Biber et al., 2011). To sum up, the current study contributes empirical eidence to a systematic and reliable conceptualization of asolute SC. This paper expands the current understanding of the utility of larg-grained and fine-grained indices of absolute SC by a comprehensive analysis of their relative explanatory power and inter-relationships in predicting argumentative writing quality.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned important insights, several limitations need to be addressed in future studies. Firstly, this study might fil o reveal the precise operational power of some indice (e., MLS) when the computational text analysis toos produce inaccurate computation due to the prevalent inguisic inadequacies in learner language. One of the reviewers rightly pointed out that one approach to dealing wth the errors in the atomatd analyes of leaner txt is to manually correct some of the most crucial errors that can affct analyses of syntax (McNamara et al., 2014). Although we adopted the EM machinery to addressed such measurement error, this study is stll imited in the absence f manual crrection of lener texts for improving the quality of the automatd analyes. Secondly, as noted y one of the reviewers, thecorrlations between the udgments of the raters, whilesatisfactory, were not very high. While sEM can partiall ddress ater diagreement, this measurement erro i likely to have some impact on the studys outcomes. We believe that even higher rater grement might have further trengthened the findings. Thirdy, the current study investigated absolute SC in a highly constrained manner. Only writing sample of a specific genre (i.e., argumentative writing) by learners with a specific language ackground (i.e.,L1 Chinese L2 English) were under investigation. Studies that compare the effects of language background, genre, and proficiency range on the utility of largegrained and fine-grained SC indices as well as their interrelationships in predicting L2 writing quality are warranted to tetify the generalizability of the current findings yielded from this specific corpus and enable a comprehensive discussion on this topic. Another limitation of this study is the absence of qualitative data analysis, which could have provided direct insights into the cognitie processe ofraters durig writing asessment and strengthened the arguments presented in this paper.
