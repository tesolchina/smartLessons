Research on the discursive practice of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) reveals the disciplinary and generic specificity inherent within a designated community, taking into account its linguistic features, rhetoric practice, and epistemic logic. Within the framework of sociocultural construction theory, the book under review presents one of these insightful studies on mechanical engineering discourse. The authors are Thi Ngoc Phuong Le and Minh Man Pham from the University of Danang, and Michael Barlow from the University of Auckland.

This monograph comprises eight chapters that report two interrelated studies – Study 1 and 2. Study 1 explores the functional and phraseological features of research papers in mechanical engineering, which are explicitly elaborated on in Chapters 1 to 6. Based on Study 1, Study 2 incorporates an investigation of the intradisciplinary variation between mechanical systems versus thermal-fluids engineering, an enquiry into the diachronic discrepancy, and an exploration of the deviation of the research traditions (experimental, theoretical, and mixed methods) of mechanical engineering. The results and discussions regarding the sub-disciplinary disparities identified in Study 2 are covered in Chapter 7. Finally, Chapter 8 concludes this book by heightening the theoretical and pedagogical implications derived from the studies.

The three opening chapters (Chapters 1–3) set the scene for this empirical investigation. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the research tradition of ESP, a list of research questions, and the organization of this book. Chapter 2 outlines Swales’ (2004) move analysis and Sinclair’s (2004) phraseology as the theoretical underpinnings of the present study. The review of moves and steps facilitates both the structural analyses and the sociocultural discussion of the rhetorical practice of the mechanical engineering community. The synthesis of phraseology serves two purposes: to incorporate lexicogrammatical constructions into move/step analysis and to justify the criteria of data extraction, including the decisions of range, frequency, and sequence of move/step in the two studies. Once again, the combination of phraseology with move/step analysis enables an extensive exploration of the sociocultural activities within disciplinary discourse since phrases are considered units of meaning that perform pragmatic functions in corpus linguistics.

Prior to understanding the rhetorical features of mechanical engineering articles, readers may find it necessary to acquaint themselves with its disciplinary culture encompassing special discursive conventions. To achieve this objective, Chapter 3 introduces the practice of the mechanical engineering discipline. The authors explain the disciplinary research traditions, epistemology, and academic community conventions to facilitate the subsequent quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the results. This chapter also includes a detailed account of the corpus compilation procedure. A total of 120 research articles (RAs) on mechanical engineering were collected and processed to address the research questions of this study.

Chapter 4 provides a detailed description of the research methodology. Two key observations regarding data coding and extraction are noteworthy in this chapter. Firstly, during the annotation process of moves/steps, many instances were observed where a move/step was embedded within another move/step in the same sentence. This peculiar arrangement is referred to as “embedding.” By analyzing the embedding, sequence, and cycle of moves/steps, the distinctiveness of the rhetorical structure in mechanical engineering RAs was examined. The second observation is that there is no one-to-one correspondence between a phrase and its structural category or discourse function in this study. Specifically, when investigating phrases from the Introduction, Method, Results-Discussion, and Conclusion (IM[RD]C) sections of the mechanical engineering RAs, it was found that one phrase type can be classified into different structural groups due to their distinct grammatical patterns in extended discourse. Similarly, the functional categorization of phrases such as research-oriented, text-oriented, and participant-oriented functions (Hyland, 2008) is also multi-faceted. In other words, one phrase may serve multiple communicative functions, and a single function may be served by one or more phrases.

Chapters 5 and 6 report the findings of Study 1. Chapter 5 focuses on the disciplinary prototypicality across the IM[RD]C sections in mechanical engineering RAs. The results of the move/step framework indicate that the Introduction section provides extensive background information. The Method section offers a more detailed and comprehensive description of the methodological approach compared to other engineering disciplines. In addition, the Results and Discussion section tends to compare the results achieved by employing other methodologies in previous research. The findings of range, length, embedding, sequence, and cyclicality of the moves/steps present a substantial reliance on referencing previous studies throughout all the IM[RD]C sections. This emphasis on references is interpreted as a justification for the research method, promotion of the credibility of results, and declaration of innovation based on the established knowledge in the discipline of mechanical engineering.

Chapter 6 presents the findings of phraseology exploration. In line with previous studies on written academic texts, mechanical engineering RAs comprise a higher frequency of phrasal expressions than clausal expressions. The major findings regarding disciplinary peculiarities include the extensive use of anticipatory ‘it’ in various patterns; more instances of phrases serving research-oriented functions than text-oriented and participant-oriented functions in the corpus; and the correspondence between functional phrases and IM[RD]C sections. These observations are explained through the lens of mechanical engineering epistemology. The authors state that writers of mechanical engineering RAs tend to stress the objectivity and reliability of their research by concealing human interventions in the research process. They also demonstrate more confidence and assertiveness when explaining and promoting the nature of their findings compared to writers of other disciplines.

Chapter 7 reports Study 2, which investigates the divergence of intradisciplinary research, differences in research traditions, and diachronic variations in mechanical engineering RAs. Specifically, thermal-fluids engineering emphasizes method validation, whereas mechanical systems articles prioritize the promotion of methods. The comparison of textual functions revealed that the thermal-fluids engineering texts use more rhetorical moves/steps to indicate the discourse structures, making them more reader-friendly than the RAs from the mechanical systems sub-discipline. The divergences of the three research paradigms are attributed to the different knowledge-making practices. That is, experimental research focuses on specific methods and results, theoretical articles use equations and formulas to explore disciplinary knowledge, and mixed methods articles compare the results from different methodological approaches.

The diachronic study found that articles published in 2002–2006 are more descriptive, and articles from 2012 to 2016 are more specific in method description. Other discrepancies between the two periods include variations in establishing research gaps, elaboration and persuasion of methods, claims of knowledge, and the use of first-person pronouns. In general, the authors demonstrate the degree of specificity required for different research purposes (e.g., functional, structural, linguistic) and research designs (synchronic or diachronic) of disciplinary academic texts in Chapter 7. This chapter concludes with a discussion on the oversimplification of exploring rhetorical practices on the disciplinary level and advocates for delving into sub-disciplinary conventions.

The final chapter of the book, Chapter 8, summarizes the main findings and highlights the contribution of the research. The authors elucidate their methodological innovation in the description of disciplinary discourse by combining move analysis with corpus-based phraseology explorations, introducing the embedding of moves/steps at the sentence level, and initiating the sequencing and collocation of the communicative functions to the exploration of cohesion at the discourse level. Meanwhile, it proposes pedagogical implications and suggestions based on the findings. The authors call for refined instruction of inter- and intradisciplinary conventions and rhetorical characteristics across different sections of RAs for learners and apprentices of specific disciplines. They suggest that the development of disciplinary awareness can be assisted by incorporating annotated corpora with writing tools equipped with informative technology.

Thus far, this book has comprehensively depicted the distinctive disciplinary features of the academic discourse of the mechanical engineering discipline, thus serving as a valuable contribution to the field of English for Specific Purposes. In terms of intradisciplinary specificity, this study explores the disparities between sub-disciplines, research paradigms, and different publication periods. The intricate divergence of the communicative function and phrasal structure co-selection on these levels illustrates the extent to which the linguistic properties vary within the academic discourses of a single discipline. To this end, the book accomplished its mission of highlighting prototypicality, framing rhetorical boundaries, and detecting variables in disciplinary discourse.

Concerning its application value, this book provides novice writers and learners in the field of mechanical engineering with a wealth of linguistic and functional knowledge necessary for writing scholarly articles in this specific field. Additionally, to better suit the exploration of mechanical engineering RAs, this study has adapted models related to move/steps, function, and phraseology. ESP researchers who are interested in studying rhetorical activities may draw inspiration from the modifications and criteria specifically designed for disciplinary discourses.

As detailed and thorough as this study is, the revelation of the multiple layers of disciplinary features and variations of the academic discourse described in this book are both good and bad news for apprentice writers in the disciplinary community. The good news is that the findings of disciplinary typicality would facilitate the mechanical engineering learners’ understanding of the RAs. The bad news is that the writing of a research paper that conforms to disciplinary conventions may seem more daunting to apprentice writers given the subtle differences between the sub-disciplines and research traditions. As suggested by the authors, disciplinary academic writing textbooks, syllabuses, and teaching methods are in dire need of development to help novice writers. In this case, corpus-based data driven learning as a modern technology-informed language teaching and learning approach could be a solution for disciplinary academic writing courses.

In all, this book offers valuable insights into the academic discourse of mechanical engineering. It also sheds light on future studies on move analysis, communicative function, and phraseology studies of disciplinary discourse. It is highly recommended to those who are interested in these fields.
