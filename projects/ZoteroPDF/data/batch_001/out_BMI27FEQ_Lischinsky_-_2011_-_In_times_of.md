# Abstract

Although both academics and policy-makers still debate its exact causes and the extent of its consequences, the ongoing financial crisis is doubtlessly the most distinctive economic event of the late 2000s. But despite the importance of such large-scale economic phenomena, there has been little research on their discursive construction. This paper presents some empirical data to show how the crisis is identified and its boundaries construed in corporate communication, seeking to understand how economic actors selectively shape public perceptions of critical events by routinely emphasising the role of certain agents and stakeholders while ignoring others. Terms for the crisis, their collocates and their discourse preferences are drawn from a 1’500’000-word ad-hoc corpus of annual reports Keywords: annual reports, corporate social responsibility, corpus linguistics, crisis communication, discourse analysis, financial crisis

# 1 Introduction

In the fall of 2005, a six-year-long uninterrupted hike in US housing prices abruptly came to a stop, causing sales to decline and real estate inventories to build up. By early 2007, lenders specialising in subprime mortgages began to fall, declaring significant losses or filing for bankruptcy. Foreclosures on such mortgages soared, and the price of securities backed with them diminished accordingly. As financial institutions rushed for liquidity, the credit market experienced a sharp contraction, and by 2008 marked falls in stock markets, international trade and the price of financial assets led to the collapse of major banking institutions, massive government intervention in the economy and the announcement of a global crisis (Fratianni & Marchionne, 2009). Economic stimulus packages and bail-outs were implemented in all major world economies, and the G-20 summit of November 2008 has been compared to the Bretton Woods Conference that gave rise to the post-war international monetary system (Ocampo, 2009).

While there is little doubt that these cascading problems jointly constitute the most significant economic event of the late 2000s, affecting households and economies throughout the world, the connections between them —as well as the adequate policy responses— are far from self-evident and still remain a matter of debate between experts. Perceiving and labelling them as a crisis is a prime example of the social construction of economic phenomena, in which values, theoretical models and tacit beliefs about the nature of the economy are mobilised to interpret and shape the ‘brute facts’ of foreclosure rates, stock market indices and bankruptcy filings.

This does not mean that crises are not ‘real’ —as some na¨ıve interpretations of constructionism might take it— but rather that their nature and boundaries are intersubjectively determined, for the most part by linguistic means; and, therefore, that the language used to talk about these phenomena is crucial in making meaning about it. From a pragmatic point of view, even more important is that the reasons for the crisis and the urgency, scope and agency of possible solutions are so constructed as well, and different discursive frames (Fillmore, 1982; Goffman, 1974)1 can have major effects in public understanding and policy decisions.

In this paper, I use corpus linguistic techniques to investigate how the global financial crisis is discursively constructed in a corpus of 50 financial and corporate social responsibility reports, as regards both its purely economic aspects and the broader context of sustainable development. While corporations are not directly in charge of public policy, they are the main economic actors in capitalist economies. Not only their prestige and importance ensures that their views on the economy exert an important influence over public opinion (Gandy, Jr., 1992; Newell & Paterson, 1998), but they also devote significant attention to lobbying for their causes in various forums, and retain public relations specialists to maximise their impact. Previous research has shown that corporate reporting devotes significant space to contextual economic factors in order to explain and justify yearly results (Crant & Bateman, 1993; Hyland, 1998; Merkl-Davies & Koller, forthcoming), and reports covering the crisis years can be expected to feature extensive discussion of the crisis and its implications for business activity, offering a privileged point of entry to the managerial perception and construction of critical events.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief introduction to the growing field of crisis communication. In Section 3, I discuss the usefulness of corpus linguistics for this kind of research, and the specific methods and materials employed are described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the lexical items used to describe the crisis in the corpus, and a quantitative summary of their collocates is given in Section 6. Section 7 refines it by means of qualitative analysis. Finally, some concluding remarks are offered in Section 8.

# 2 Crisis and discourse

Although crisis communication has been a field of rapid growth within the business literature over the past 15 years, it has remained largely silent about the topic of nation- or worldwide crises. Historically linked to public relations, its initial goal was exploring avenues for managing stockholder impressions of institutions facing public concern, especially the containment and shaping of media reporting. Sparked by incidents such as the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown (Murray, 1981) or the 1982 Tylenol tampering (Benson, 1988), the subdiscipline has focused on reputational crises, and for the most part remained firmly wedded to this inevitably firm-centred perspective $^ 2$ , even as the seminal work of Coombs & Holladay (1996, 2010) led to more systematic models of threats to corporate public reputation and of the means to contain them. Schultz & Raupp (2010) have pointed out that the ‘fundamental structural differences’ between the private and the public sphere make these models of little worth when exploring crisis sense-making in broader terms.

Other foci of analysis —such as presidential rhetoric in the construction of international crises (Cherwitz & Zagacki, 1986; Kuypers, 1997)— have been similarly restricted, and there has been little systematic exploration of the discursive construction of crises affecting society as a whole, whether political or economic (but see Jessop, 2009, 346). Research on the linguistic resources that may be mobilised for such a purpose remains fragmentary, whether regarding the role of the media (e.g., White, 2000, 2004) or direct communication from economic and political actors (Schultz & Raupp, 2010). Such an omission seems specially surprising, given that crises belong conspicuously to the core topics of mediated communication. They constitute large-scale, usually unexpected, negative events requiring the involvement of political and social leaders, and potentially affecting the public at large, all of them features that have been robustly identified as commanding widespread attention (Fowler, 1991; van Dijk, 1988). Public discourse on crises is important as well because of their intrinsically mediate character. The considerable interpretive work that goes into defining the nature and boundaries of critical events is at least partially constrained by how they are construed and given meaning in their discursive presentation. Furthermore, since crises ex hypothesi demand measures to contain and correct their impact, their discursive construction can have a strongly constitutive effect on public policy (van Dijk, 1993), selectively legitimating certain courses on action on the basis of the implicit bias of the construal.

# 3 Corpora in discourse analysis

A comprehensive examination of the discursive construction of crises in contemporary society lies obviously beyond the remit of this paper, not only be cause of the diverse structure of the genres that this construction may involve —from hard news to electoral programmes to religious homilies to academic discussion—, but also because the relevant discursive patterns draw heavily on world knowledge and contextual features. This makes them unsuitable for purely automated approaches, and requires labour-intensive manual annotation and analysis (Bednarek, 2009). Consequently, most discourse analytic enquiries tend to focus on small sets of texts, and to select their methodology opportunistically in the light of the textual features evident on close reading. While enabling highly sophisticated and rich interpretation, this poses considerable problems of replicability, generalisability and representativeness, and makes an incremental approach to the problem all the more difficult because of variations in methods and materials.

However, a potential solution to this conundrum is illustrated by the growing body of research employing corpus linguistic methods, where information technology is used to allow the identification of routine patterns of lexical and cotextual distribution over large volumes of data (Conrad, 2002; Koller & Mautner, 2004; Mautner, 2005). These techniques have been profitably used to analyse the construction of social categories in political and media discourse, such as the distribution of the ideologically loaded terms ethnic $^ 3$ , racial and tribal in the press (Krishnamurthy, 1996); the construction of the elderly in specific thematic roles (Mautner, 2007); and typical patterns in discussing risk among laypeople and professionals, sometimes strikingly different from the portrayal envisaged by risk sociology (Hamilton, Adolphs, & Nerlich, 2007).

While it remains true that ‘there is no analytic routine through which a text can be run, with a critical description issuing automatically at the end’ (Fowler & Kress, 1979, 179), computer-assisted methods for treating large corpora can offer the researcher a more focused approach to texts, by highlighting lexical and grammatical regularities —such as significant co-occurrence of terms, preference for certain grammatical categories or evaluative prosodies, or variations in labelling—, as well as by displaying systematic patterns from which qualitative enquiry can proceed (Mautner, 2007).

# 4 A corpus approach to crisis

Such an approach is especially fruitful when distinctive lexis is involved, and crisis and its synonyms offer a clear starting point. To investigate the contribution of corporate actors to the public construal of the financial crisis, annual reports —being ‘the most publicized and visible document produced by publicly owned companies’ (Henriques & Sadorsky, 1999, 91)— were chosen as the empirical material. They possess the requisite uniformity in communicative function (Sinclair, 2005, 1), are the main voice for corporate beliefs about the role of the organisation in society, its mediate and immediate goals, its obligations and its interlocutors (Fiol, 1989, 278), and over the past decades have conspicuously incorporated sustainability and responsibility concerns, addressing society as a whole rather than stockholders alone.

As no ready-made corpora of annual reports are available, one was specifically designed for this study. To avoid factoring national variations in legal requirements and practices, the decision was made to focus on a single country. Financial, CSR and environmental reports for 2008 were collected from the 75 largest Swedish companies, identified as those (a) traded in the Stockholm Stock Exchange; or (b) owned by the Swedish state. Since not all the selected firms had issued reports, the final corpus consisted of 50 documents totalling 1’541’783 tokens.

The documents were digitally converted to raw text, retaining all tables and charts but ignoring pictorial and layout data, and hand-checked for conversion errors before loading in the corpus analysis toolkit AntConc (Anthony, 2005)4. Due to the nature of the analysis, no part-of-speech or other tagging was necessary. The software generates word lists, keyword-in-context concordances and collocation lists, as well as calculating statistical significance measures for collocates, of which the mutual information (MI) score $^ 5$ is most relevant to the paper’s purposes. By using a reference corpus, it also becomes possible to determine which words show statistically significant differences in frequency, thus providing a robust method for identifying keywords.

# 5 Selecting lexical items

As a starting point, a set of terms that shared a similar semantic space with crisis was compiled— synonyms, near-synonyms, meronyms and hyponyms. Usual thesauri have limited usefulness for this purpose, as the cut-off level of similarity for determining inclusion varies widely and is often arbitrary. The corpus-based FrameNet lexical database (Fillmore & Baker, 2010), for example, includes crisis as part of two semantic frames: catastrophe, broadly defined as ‘an Undesirable Event which affects the Undergoer negatively’, and hostile encounter, an ‘encounter between opposing forces (Side 1 and Side 2, collectively conceptualisable as Sides) over a disputed Issue and/or in order to reach a specific Purpose’, only the first of which is relevant to this paper. The list of lexical units denoting this frame is given in Table 1.

Table 1: Terms semantically related to crisis, according to FRAMENET   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Term</td><td>Part of speech</td></tr><tr><td>apocalypse</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>befall</td><td>verb</td></tr><tr><td>betide</td><td>verb</td></tr><tr><td>calamitous</td><td>adjective</td></tr><tr><td>calamity</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>casualty</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>cataclysm</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>catastrophe</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>catastrophic</td><td>adjective</td></tr><tr><td>debacle</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>disaster</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>disastrous</td><td>adjective</td></tr><tr><td>incident</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>mischance</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>misfortune</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td> mishap</td><td>noun</td></tr><tr><td>suffer</td><td>verb</td></tr><tr><td>tragedy</td><td>noun</td></tr></table></body></html>

The hand-designed lexical database WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), in turn, offers two entries, defined respectively as ‘an unstable situation of extreme danger or difficulty’ and ‘a crucial stage or turning point in the course of something’. The lexical entries linked to them are listed in table 2. However, most of these terms are either far broader (incident) or narrower (Dunkirk) than usually suggested by the phrase financial crisis, and many of them were not attested in the corpus. A further list of nouns was compiled from the terms in the corpus that shared phraseological patterns or statistically significant lexical collocates with crisis. Somewhat surprisingly, only one of the above terms (slump) appeared, and that with almost negligible frequency6.

The final set of seven nouns assembled by this process consisted of crisis, downturn, recession, slowdown, slump, turbulence and turmoil. Notably, all attested synonyms of crisis are originally metaphoric, and —with the exception of recession, so predominantly used in its economic sense to have obscured the spatial aspects of its etymon— visibly retain the reference to their source domain (cf. Koller & Farrelly, 2010) Frequencies for these terms, both absolute and per mille, are given in Table $3 ^ { 7 }$ , together with comparative data from the British National Corpus $^ 8$ .

Concordances were prepared for each of these lemmata, a total of 369 occurrences. Each of these was hand-tagged for typical patterns of usage, both in terms of grammatical relations and broader semantic context. Additionally, lists of the main collocates of these items, ranked both by raw frequency of co-occurrence and by their Mutual Information score, were generated using AntConc.

# 6 Quantitative results

All items under investigation appear with considerable more frequency in the ad-hoc corpus than in the non-specific BNC ( $\chi ^ { 2 } \ = \ 1 1 8 9 . 9 3 8$ , $p \ < \ 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ), showing the importance of the topic within these texts. A comparison of the rank of lemmata within each corpus (crisis $>$ downturn $>$ recession $>$ slowdown $>$ turbulence $>$ turmoil $>$ slump, vs crisis $>$ recession $>$ slump $>$ turbulence $>$ turmoil $>$ downturn $>$ slowdown) suggests that downturn and slowdown are favoured with unusual frequency by the writers of these reports, while slump is especially infrequent. This is, again, likely due to the specific topic of the reports, since the favoured terms are those most closely associated with economic and financial phenomena, while slump shows a much broader range of usage.

Besides the benefit of providing accurate empirical measures of the frequency of terms in particular contexts, corpus analysis also allows a synthetic view of other items that tend to co-occur with them— ‘the company they keep’, as Firth (1951) famously put it— and the effect co-occurrence has on interpretation. Hoey (2005) has convincingly argued that a, largely unconscious, record of the semantic and pragmatic environment in which terms tend to appear features prominently in the interpretive process, and that readers are primed to expect a similar environment whenever they re-encounter the term. Table 4 shows the top lexical collocates for 6 of the selected terms, ranked by joint frequency. The limited occurrence of slump prevents calculation of collocates with any statistical significance, and it was thus ignored. Function words as well as proper names were excluded, as is usual in corpus-based discourse research, and a minimum MI-score of 3 was established as a cut-off point for excluding chance associations9.

Table 4: Main lexical collocates for crisis-denoting terms in the corpus   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Node</td><td>Main lexical collocates</td></tr><tr><td>CRISIS</td><td>financial, global, management, economic, affected, incident, climate, hit, downturn, current, year, business, new, market, result, manage, industry, impacted, impact, finance, econ-. omy, demand, communications, times, support</td></tr><tr><td>DOWNTURN</td><td>economic, global, financial, economy, current, market, crisis, result, demand, severe, world, affected, year, sustained, mar- kets, lower, impact, affect, strong, industry, hit, construction, combined, business</td></tr><tr><td>RECESSION SLOWDOWN</td><td>global, market, year, position, crisis economic, global, economy, quarter, market, turmoil, real,.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>fourth, demand, began</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TURBULENCE financial, market, markets, interest.</td></tr><tr><td>TURMOIL</td><td>financial, global, economic, slowdown, markets, current</td></tr></table></body></html>

The shared collocates clearly show the semantic overlap between terms. Most items in the set are linked to economics and the market —a rather significant feature on its own, given that the texts in the corpus were specifically chosen from those reporting on corporate social and environmental responsibility. Only crisis is frequently enough associated with environmental phenomena —the climate crisis— to show it in its collocational patterns, and although several processes and participants related to crises are identifiable in the list, none of them specifically convey social concerns. Business, industry —especially construction—, market and demand are the main entities discussed, all of them very generic terms that give few clues as to the specific nature of this crisis. Verbal collocates also show a markedly high level of abstraction, with none of the three most frequent verbs (impact, affect, hit) conveying any semantic information beyond that of ‘exerting a (negative) impact’. Although the severity of the event is sharply underscored in a variety of dimensions — physical (world, global), temporal (sustained) and intensity (severe)— no concrete processes or actors are immediately apparent.

The profile resulting from this quantitative analysis shows the crisis to be strongly associated with abstract, macroeconomic aggregates, and only much more weakly with its subsequent social influence or with other stakeholders, who for the most part do not appear in the text. A second association relates talk about the crisis to abstract material processes, with no instances of concrete description apparent. While these patterns are interesting on their own, their main value for corpus-aided discourse analysis lies in identifying points of entry for further exploration. In the following section, this evidence is refined by examining these lemmata in their immediate textual environment by means of concordances.

# 7 Qualitative analysis

The quantitative evidence in the preceding section showed that the crisis is discussed quite often in these texts, but not in a way that could clearly delineate features other than its importance and negativity. However, this form of analysis forcibly decontextualises lexical items, and sheds very little light on the specific role they may be playing in the texts. A qualitative analysis of the relevant concordances, on the other hand, can provide a more precise collocational profile by revealing the concrete grammatical patterns in which these associations are realised, as well as pointing to other terms from these domains that contribute to the prosody while not being statistically significant enough to appear on their own. Due to space limitations, a full list of instances cannot be provided, but Concordance 1 presents a random sample of 40 occurrences of the lemmata under investigation.

Concordance 1: Random sample of the concordance for selected lemmata ( $\overset { \cdot } { n } =$ 369)

Close scrutiny of the concordance output suggests several interesting patterns of semantic prosody and semantic preference. A large proportion of the nouns (above 70%) occurring in the vicinity of the selected terms describe economic systems and phenomena in terms that detach them from the concrete agents involved (investment activity, business cycles, growing market, operating environment), many of them nominalisations. If self-references to the issuing company are excluded, the figure climbs to about 85%.

This suggests that —even though annual reports, especially those devoted to environmental and CSR issues, are supposed to be prepared for the benefit of stakeholders— discussions of the crisis in this context tend to centre around general, abstract models of causal relations in economics, rather than around the concrete impact the situation may have on specific human and institutional agents. There are 34 mentions of customers, 14 mentions of suppliers, 7 of employees (plus two of personnel and two of workforce) and a mere five each of society and government— far less than the 96 references to markets, the 59 to economy or the 53 to demand, the most frequent noun forms in this environment.

# 7.1 Construing crises

This contrasts with the fact that an overwhelming majority of references specifically deal with the present situation and not with crises in general, as can be seen from the high preference for the definite article, as well as from frequent co-occurrence with the adjective current (and, to a lesser extent, ongoing). Only 12 of the 369 instances, presented in Concordance 2, can be interpreted as general statements about the causes, consequences and requirements of crisis situations.

A summary analysis of the expanded context for these concordances shows general discussion of crises to focus on two topics:

Remedies It is possible and necessary to prepare for crises and react to them, offsetting their effects by reductions in working capital and, especially, the workforce.

While the lack of mention of the causes of crises may be explained by the above being general discussions that cannot contemplate all possible alternatives, it is interesting to note that no such restraint is exercised in suggesting solutions. In line with hegemonic managerial theories, but decrying the social commitment that companies claim to endorse elsewhere in these reports (Lischinsky, 2010, 2011, forthcoming), the orthodox tool-kit of divestment and lay-offs is implicitly assumed to be universally useful —no matter what the causes of uncertainty and reduction in trade volumes may be— and touted as a proof of good business sense:

(1) The fiscal year 2008/2009 was very tough. Like most companies, Stena was hard hit by the financial crisis and was forced to lay off employees. “This is extremely unusual for the Stena Metall Group,” says Per-Martin

Schedwin. “Layoffs always mean tough but necessary decisions. I feel we handled it in a positive way that created a sense of calm for the employees who are still with us. Our business acumen has proved to be invaluable in times of crisis.”

# 7.2 Stakeholders in the crisis

This impression is borne by an examination of the complete concordance, where all mentions of personnel relating to the crisis are made in the context of justifying workforce reductions, even when an unambiguously positive assessment of employees’ role is presented. Lay-offs are described as forced, recalling the rhetorical claim that ‘there is no alternative’ often associated with neoliberal economic discourse (Fairclough, 2000):

(2) The global financial crisis impacted both Outokumpu and our personnel. Unfortunately, workforce reductions could not be avoided. [. . . ] As the poor demand for stainless steel continued, however, in February 2009 we were forced to announce a series of further actions.

The role of political bodies is similarly limited in this portrayal of the crisis. The few instances of government in this context centre around the stimulus packages and financial securities that central banks and national executives were, again, forced to implement, with no mention of their role as regulators of the financial and economic system. Discussions of society, in turn, either present it as the undergoer of financial and environmental troubles, or routinely state the company’s commitment to ‘contribute as an actor in society’, without any explanation of what this might entail in a crisis situation.

# 7.3 Causes and consequences

While a significant proportion of mentions of the crisis (around 60%, taking the paragraph as the unit for analysis) include at least some detail about its mechanisms of propagation and the way in which they led to the reporting company being affected, the texts in the corpus seem much less willing to comment on its causes. The suggestion that the slowdown in the real economy is a more or less direct consequence of financial instability is pervasive, even if seldom explicit; lines 5, 7 or 10 in Concordance 1 exemplify the usual way in which such an attribution is presented, through a coordinated noun phrase that does not attempt to explain the relation between those phenomena. Some more detailed formulations can be found in reports with a heavier financial content, as in the example below:

(3) In autumn the economic decline increased. Tighter credit availability, high interest rates on loans and significantly falling asset prices culminated in a financial crisis that from mid-October severely threatened global financial stability. The fear of inflation that pervaded the first half-year rapidly changed to a fear of deflation. In the final quarter of the year the decline in the world economy was exceptionally strong and most major economies went into recession.

An analysis of the expanded concordance shows 50 mentions of demand, 34 of price and 7 of credit as being the mediating factors in the impact, as illustrated in Concordance 3.

Concordance 3: Concordance for causal explanations of the crisis

However, attempts to go beyond this rather transparent relation are extremely scarce. Only three reports engage the topic of the underlying causes of the financial crisis at any length, and, tellingly, they show no uniformity in their assessment. One of them, a forestry cooperative highly sensitive to variations in the construction sector, follows the now standard view that problems in the US housing market triggered the crisis:

(4) The US housing crisis has developed into a global financial crisis and a recession with a duration that is hard to foresee. Rising unemployment and lower GNP growth not only reduce private consumption but also investment willingness in the business sector. Construction and print media advertising are also affected.

This cursory explanation does not provide any insight on the mechanisms by which the crisis became generalised and global, nor on the underlying causes of the failure in the housing market. All factors seem entirely exogenous to the business world. The excerpt below, on the other hand, offers a brief yet broader view of the functioning of the financial markets, where the involvement of a number of different agents is portrayed. However, government institutions are present only through their measures of last resort, and no mention is made of their regulatory role. Business, in turn, is absent from the text, and only appears implicitly as a customer of the capital market.

(5) At the end of the third quarter of 2008, the financial turmoil that began in the capital market in 2007 entered an extremely turbulent phase. A crisis of confidence arose, which led to a substantial weakening of the function of the capital market, resulting in a liquidity shortage. As a result of the massive support measures implemented by various national governments and central banks, this financial turbulence subsided toward the end of the year.

Only one company goes beyond surface phenomena to provide an explanation (partly reproduced in the excerpt below) as part of a three-page long introduction to their report. Interestingly, the company is an important defence contractor, and much of the explanation is devoted to highlighting the main features of the highly internationalised ‘New World Order’ it envisions, based on increasing recourse to supra-national policy institutions and the willing abandonment of national self-sufficiency.

(6) The financial crisis in 2008 has clearly shown what can happen when one of the global transaction systems fails. It has an immediate, dramatic effect on the volume of transactions. In the long run, it creates not only bankruptcies and unemployment but also the risk of protectionism and new national conflicts and battles over resources and assets. The financial crisis is the first real setback for the new flow-centered society.

The extensive historical overview offered does not, however, make any mention of the banking and financial systems. It is argued that ‘there are players in the geopolitical arena that exploit both systems [the Westphalian and Dumbarton Oaks designs, AL] at the same time to achieve their strategic objectives’, but their nature is not even hinted at in the text, and careful close reading would be needed to recover them from elsewhere in the 148-page report. All in all, no suggestion is made anywhere in the texts that regulation of the capital markets may help solve the crisis or improve the sustainability of the system, although this is less than surprising given the conspicuous absence of discussions of sustainability in the context of the crisis.

# 8 Concluding remarks

The main concern of this paper lay with exploring how the causes, outcomes and possible remedies of the crisis are portrayed in financial and annual sustainability reports, and especially how were references to the crisis used as part of the overall aim of persuading stock- and stakeholders of the adequacy of managerial choices. While a comprehensive assessment would require extensive research to factor in national variations in genre structure and regulatory requirements, the data presented here provide a first point of entry, and suggest that nonfinancial outcomes still occupy a largely peripheral position within these reports. While the usefulness and appeal of crisis-centred explanations as justifications of financial performance has been reliably proved, such explanations are only scarcely present when it comes to social and environmental indicators.

The business-oriented quality of crisis discussions in these reports can be traced back to its collocational and prosodic profile. Typical collocates are drawn from the domains of economics and finance, and are semantically related to profit, turnover and the market. Other stakeholders —such as employees, government and local communities— play a peripheral role, if any, and are clearly subordinate to the economic goal of maximising dividends. This marginal character is compounded by a marked tendency towards abstract formulations that obscure the concrete communities and institutions with which the company interacts.

A narrow focus is also evident in discussions of remedies, where lay-offs are assumed to be a natural response to crisis situations, and no space is allotted to presenting the view of employees. This is not based on specific analyses of the causes and mechanisms of the critical juncture, which are largely absent from the texts. So are discussions of its impact on sustainability practices. Although (measurable) commitment to sustainability seems to motivate crisisrelated explanations in a minority of reports, these are negligible in terms of the overall volume of text, and remain marginal within the genre.

Our analysis is, however, partial, and more research would be needed to approach a globally accurate picture. The data under consideration are limited to reports issued under the Swedish regulatory framework in 2009, and provide no hints as to diachronic trends, the effect of different regulations and national cultures, or the rhetorical design of other genres of business environmental discourse, such as the environmental awareness booklets discussed by Skulstad (2005). Comparative research —examining differences in lexis and prosody between texts of different sources— would be needed as well to provide a definitive profile of the construal of crises in business discourse, and its influence on other genres and agents cannot be clearly grasped without ethnographic inquiry on the context of production and use of such texts. However, the evidence presented here provides a useful example of the support that corpus methods can bring to discourse analysis.

# Notes

1Despite the important theoretical differences between the sociological and psychological, and the linguistic understanding of frames, both notions point broadly to the same phenomenon, i.e., the fact that the world-knowledge associated with lexical items is crucial to the subsequent interpretation of discourse. Cf. Telles Ribeiro & Hoyle (2009).

2Other fields of research that formerly employed the label ‘crisis communication’, such as the role of the media and international venues in the buildup of international conflicts, or professional intervention in health crises, never became sufficiently established to contest the majority use.

3In this paper, small capitals are used to present query expressions used in the concordancing software, while specific word forms are rendered in fixed pitch. A string like crisis, thus, covers the word forms crisis and crises. Angle brackets $( < > )$ indicate placeholders for expressions, such as grammatical categories, that were manually evaluated by the analyst.

5More properly termed Pointwise Mutual Information, MI is normally understood in corpus research as the amount of information that the occurrence of a term contributes towards determining the occurrence of another. Manning & Schutze (1999, 178–183) point out that, since MI is sensitive to the overall frequencies of terms, it provides inaccurate estimates for sparse data. To avoid this, the usual practice of ignoring items with $f < 5$ has been followed, even if it is less precise than using a modified formula, as no currently available software supports these corrections.

6Catastrophe, disaster, incident, crossroad and depression appear in the corpus, but manual examination shows that no instances of these terms refer to the economic crisis or comparable phenomena.

7These exclude instances where the terms were not found to refer to the economic and financial situation.

8On the basis of the lexical and spelling choices prevalent in the reports, they were judged more similar to Commonwealth than American English, and the BNC selected for comparative purposes. Further analysis using data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English, not reported in detail here, shows that the phenomena discussed in the paper are not likely to be due to dialectal variation.

$^ { 9 }$ Using t-scores instead does not significantly alter the findings, and they were ignored for the paper’s purposes.
