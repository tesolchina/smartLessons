# ABSTRACT

As active student participation in classroom interaction is widely accepted as a central component of foreign language learning, prompting student contributions becomes consequential in L2 educational settings including synchronous remote classrooms. When there is a lack of response following teacher questions, teachers resort to a variety of practices to elicit a response from students. Teachers’ response-pursuit moves are vital both to ensure interactional and pedagogical progressivity and secure student engagement. This study deals with the absence of student response to teacher questions in a largely unexplored interactional setting, namely large group, remote, synchronous, video-mediated L2 classrooms. Using multimodal conversation analysis for the examination of screen-recorded higher education English as a foreign language classroom interactions, this single case analysis documents interactional resources that an EFL teacher employs for pursuing a response and eliciting student participation. We show that in the focal context, when the teacher’s question is left unanswered and no one bids for the turn in the response slot, the teacher draws on diverse interactional practices as well as a range of screen-based multimodal resources to ensure the progressivity of the ongoing activity. Revealing how these resources maximize the interactional space, this study contributes to the understanding of the interactional organization of teacher response-pursuits and provides insights into video-mediated L2 classroom discourse.

# 1.  Introduction

Prompting student contributions is a very central practice in L2 educational settings (Reddington, 2018), and remote contexts are not exceptions. As much of classroom interaction and the relevant research effort have evolved around initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) (McHoul, 1978; Mehan, 1979) sequences, in which teachers initiate interaction mostly with questions followed by a student response in the second turn and teacher evaluation in the third turn, teacher response-pursuits are frequent practices in educational contexts. In order to get student responses to their questions, teachers employ a number of turn-allocation practices such as individual nominations (Kääntä, 2010; Mehan, 1979; Mortensen, 2008) and embodied resources (Kääntä, 2010, 2012; Sert, 2015; Watanabe, 2016). These practices also address the class as a whole which requires not to allocate the turn to a specific student, but to allow for self-nomination. Thus, they increase the potential to breed various opportunities for the participation of more than one potential incipient speaker. Additionally, students show their willingness to take the floor through various ways such as hand-raising (Sahlström, 2002), body-positioning, gazing toward the teacher, or taking turns without being allocated (Kardaş İşler et al., 2019). Although hand-raising is an available technical feature of most videoconferencing tools, identifying students’ displays of willingness through other bodily resources such as gazing and positioning to allocate turns is a challenge in synchronous remote classrooms. Taken together with the lack of student initiative to take turns without teachers’ allocation in low participation settings, teachers’ practices for eliciting student contributions and how they differ from face-to-face settings play an even more active role for an overall understanding of remote pedagogical settings.

More specifically, when there is a lack of response or when teacher prompts are left unanswered, it does not only result in missing learning opportunities as a result of low level of active student participation but also in impediments on the interactional and pedagogical progressivity (i.e. pedagogical activity at hand) in remote contexts. To secure the maintenance of interaction through increasing student participation, teachers deploy a variety of practices to elicit a response from students, which are largely referred to as response-pursuit practices (Aldrup, 2019; Chazal, 2015; Duran & Jacknick, 2020; Etehadieh & Rendle-Short, 2016; Hosoda, 2014; Lam Hoang & Filipi, 2019). Accordingly, teachers’ response-pursuit moves are vital both to ensure interactional and pedagogical progressivity and secure student engagement. Therefore, to improve teaching and learning practices in language classrooms, it is important to systematically analyze classroom interaction and reveal specific resources employed by teachers to create interactional space for students. However, despite the research interest in response-pursuit practices in face-to-face classroom interactional settings and the increasingly common use of fully online modes of language teaching, the interactional resources that teachers employ to elicit student participation in online environments, especially in synchronous video-mediated classrooms, have remained largely unexplored. Therefore, a close examination response-pursuit moves in video-mediated classrooms holds the potential to improve the overall understanding of teachers’ interactional practices and inform language teaching practices in remote settings.

With this in mind, in what follows, we depict the state-of-the-art regarding the response-pursuit practices used for eliciting student participation and continue with a review of the recent research on online L2 classroom discourse. Subsequently, we describe the data and research context, present a single case analysis using the methodological tools of multimodal conversation analysis, and conclude the paper with a discussion on the findings.

# 2.1.  Eliciting student participation: classroom turn-taking system and response-pursuits

Talk in interaction is systematically organized so that one speaker speaks at a time, and speaker change occurs smoothly in order to obviate long pauses between turns. Sacks et  al. (1974) introduced a set of rules of turn allocation in talk-in-interaction: (i) the current speaker selects the next speaker or (ii) parties self-select. While turn-taking has a context-free disposition, it is also sensitive to the social interactional realities shaped based on the goal-oriented nature of local and institutional contexts. In classroom interaction, turn-taking is enacted predominantly through a pre-allocated system as such it has a more fixed organization than ordinary talk. Therefore, turn-taking in classroom settings holds distinctive characteristics in the organization of turn allocation (Markee, 2000; McHoul, 1978; Mehan, 1979; Seedhouse, 2004). In our focal context, a video-mediated L2 classroom, the teacher directs the questions to the whole class without identifying any incipient recipients, thus withholding the turn allocation, and in doing so opens space for bidding. Teacher questions as sequence-initiating actions make verbal student response relevant (Stivers & Rossano, 2010). Yet, when no one bids for the turn or provides an answer, the teacher resorts to follow-up moves to pursue a response.

Response-pursuit is a recipient-designed resource used both in ordinary and institutional interactions to maintain the progressivity of talk-in-interaction. Prior research (Bolden et  al., 2012; Pomerantz, 1984; Stivers & Rossano, 2010) shows that speakers treat the lack of response as a sign of trouble in understanding (Bolden et  al., 2012), misalignment (Pomerantz, 1984), and upcoming dispreferred response (Etehadieh & Rendle-Short, 2016), and they initiate repair actions using a range of practices to elicit a response. Pomerantz (1984) describes how speakers modify their questions by providing more details or substituting words in their questions to deal with delayed responses. Similarly, Gardner (2004) documents a range of resources that L2 speakers employ such as adding an increment to the question or reformulation in instances where their questions are followed by a silence. Bolden et  al. (2012) shows that first speakers also repair ambiguous indexical items to resolve troubles due to insufficient responses.

In pedagogical settings, teachers use diverse response-pursuit practices including reformulated questions (Etehadieh & Rendle-Short, 2016); language alternation (Lam Hoang & Filipi, 2019); language-related assistance such as translating the questions, repeating key words in questions (Hosoda, 2014); and reformulation and extension of previous turns (Aldrup, 2019). In an L2 French classroom context, Chazal (2015) explores how pedagogical artifacts in the classroom are used as a resource for pursuing student response in the face of interactional troubles that emerge when the student response is missing, inadequate or incorrect. For example, teachers’ bodily orientation to a pedagogical artifact by writing or pointing gives students clues about the adequacy of their response (also see ‘cluing’ Hosoda & Aline, 2013; McHoul, 1990), influences turn allocation practices and contributes to progressivity of interaction. Of direct relevance to our study is Duran and Jacknick’s study (2020) in which they describe teachers’ response-pursuing work when their inquiries are left unanswered in an English as a medium of instruction (EMI) context. They show that in attending to students’ displays of unwillingness to participate (Sert, 2015), teachers employ a range of practices to receive a sequentially relevant student response and increase participation, namely modeling a response, using multimodal resources including pedagogical artifacts in the classroom, embodied behaviors, and vocalization. In a content and language integrated learning (CLIL) classroom setting, Aldrup (2019) explores teacher moves used for the establishment of mutual understanding and describes how response-pursuit practices including reformulation and extending initiation following students’ verbal and embodied trouble displays resolve interactional troubles and restore intersubjectivity. Overall, existing research on response-pursuit practices informs how teachers manage participation and learner engagement in language classrooms. Although research on response-pursuit practices is scarce, there is existing research evidence informing online classrooms, to which we turn to in the following section.

# 2.2.  Online L2 classroom discourse

The bulk of research on the ways of eliciting student participation remained limited to face-to-face learning environments comprising physically co-present teachers and students, which left unexplored the various forms of online communication in remote educational practices. Additionally, the physical distance obligation forced by the global COVID-19 pandemic prompted the rapid transition of teaching activities to online synchronous and asynchronous practices (Foung et  al., 2022; Jocuns et  al., 2020; Moorhouse et  al., 2021). Within the scope of the pandemic restrictions, teachers and students moved to online platforms where synchronous educational practices are mostly maintained by various videoconferencing tools. Therefore, once being supplementary, extracurricular, or optional for many stakeholders, online classrooms with geographically dispersed students have become increasingly prevalent, and the dearth of research informing such settings have been more apparent than ever. This research and practice gap call for a closer attention to better understand the challenges encountered and teachers’ ways to tackling them during remote teaching. Among these challenges are low levels of active student participation in online classrooms.

Online platforms for conducting remote teaching combine both spoken and textual conversations, and students draw on different resources to co-construct understanding in situ (Satar, 2016). For example, while teachers seem to primarily prefer verbal interaction in online educational environments, they also orient to the students’ textual contributions in the chat box. The interactional practices employed by teachers may vary according to the contextual configurations of the platform, which can yield the use of interactional resources different from their face-to-face classroom-based instructional repertoires. As Tudini (2012) states technological resources and artifacts such as computers and communication software inevitably modify interaction, depending on constraints and affordances of the medium. The digital social ecology of video-mediated interactions (Arminen et  al., 2016; Heath & Luff, 1993) leads to unique interactional circumstances including turn-taking and allocation, disrupted adjacency-pairs (Schönfeldt & Golato, 2003), thus teachers may need to adapt the ways in which the teaching-learning process is successfully implemented. As a result, the potential impact of different educational environments on online classroom discourse (Hampel & Stickler, 2012) makes it necessary to investigate interactional patterns and practices in these platforms to improve remote teaching practices.

With this in mind, Hochuli (forthcoming) has recently investigated the interactional architecture of a university level remote class, compared question-answer sequences in ‘face wall’ (i.e. all student cameras are on) and text-based situations, and found that the text-based question delivery observably reduces interactional pressure on the students. By closely examining the silence trajectories after teacher questions, Hochuli identifies that the silence is visible and accountable in the face wall situation and referred to the participation status of the students as ‘non-talking heads’ inspired by Licoppe and Morel (2012) concept, talking heads, to describe the full-screen, upper body only video-mediated interactions. Accordingly, even if students turn on their cameras and keep it as such during the synchronous activities, teachers still face the challenge of increasing student participation by deploying diverse verbal and nonverbal resources. We present one such context in which all cameras are on, but the student contributions are scarce. Although CALL studies investigating student-student interactions in various online environments are widespread (e.g. Abe, 2021; Balaman, 2018; Balaman & Sert, 2017; Çimenli et  al., 2022; Jenks, 2014; O’Dowd & Lewis, 2016; Ro, 2022; Satar, 2013, 2016; Sert & Balaman, 2018; Wang, 2006), the interactional resources that teachers employ in online education environments remain largely unexplored in CALL literature. In one of the few studies, Satar and Wigham (2017) investigate trainee teachers’ instruction giving practices in web conferencing supported language teaching sessions focusing on their practices in marking different stages of instructions using gaze and webcam proximity as well as the use of gaze and gestures in allocating roles. In a more recent study, Malabarba et  al. (2022) document how a teacher secures learners’ interactional space for language use through a range of resources such as lip pressing and ‘go ahead’ gestures in overlap resolution trajectories. Examining synchronous online language classrooms, Park and Park (2022) explore a teacher’s use of verbal and written designedly incomplete utterances (DIUs) to elicit student participation. In a similar vein, ways of sustaining interactions in videoconferencing settings have also been investigated (Satar, 2015, 2016). Satar (2015) describes how language learners promote interaction through some indicators of social presence including questions, backchannels, reciprocation, listening, paying attention, and collaboration in online multimodal language interactions. Satar (2016) also demonstrates the role of multimodal resources in meaning making in intercultural communication via desktop videoconferencing. Recent research has also depicted various online intercultural exchange projects increasing participants’ engagement (Akayoglu et  al., 2022; Canto & Jauregi-Ondarra, 2021; Fuchs, 2020; Oskoz & Gimeno-Sanz, 2020), the necessity of training online language teachers (Ekin et al., 2021; Badem-Korkmaz et al., 2022; Hampel & Stickler, 2005; Lewis, 2006), teachers’ instructional strategies in sustaining individual and group attention (Meskill & Anthony, 2014), the role of modes of meaning-making (Hampel, 2014), and new patterns of communication (Hampel & Stickler, 2012).

A close examination of online EFL classrooms might also add to an overall understanding of the properties of classroom interactional competence (CIC), ‘teachers’ and learners ability to use interaction as a tool for mediating and assisting learning’ (Walsh, 2011, p. 158), by documenting the resources that may hinder or create learning opportunities in online language classrooms and identifying the pedagogically meaningful ways of dealing with participation problems. In a recent survey-based study relevant to CIC, Moorhouse et  al. (2021) have expanded the coverage of CIC with the addition of technological competencies, online environment management, and online teacher interactional competence to the properties, and introduce the concept of ‘classroom interactional competence in online contexts’ (e-CIC). They have also called for further microanalytic examination of online classroom interaction data to understand teachers’ actual practices using the methodological tools of CA.

Against this background, we see great merit in examining the micro-moments of online classroom interactions and showing the lived senses of the teachers while trying to resolve participation troubles in situ. Accordingly, we draw on the strong research background describing the response-pursuit practices for eliciting student participation in L2 classrooms and address the gap in fully understanding the extent to which these practices are operational in video-mediated L2 classrooms. Using multimodal conversation analysis for the examination of screen-recorded higher education EFL classroom interactions, we document the interactional resources that an EFL teacher deploys for pursuing a response. We show (i) how an EFL teacher manages to elicit responses from students to her questions that are left unanswered initially by drawing on response-pursuit moves, and (ii) how she employs further practices to elicit preferred responses when the students’ answers are deemed incomplete, inadequate, or incorrect. Accordingly, this paper seeks responses to the following research questions which also describe the coverage of this study:

What are the interactional resources employed by an EFL teacher for eliciting/ activating student participation in a video-mediated L2 classroom?

How does the EFL teacher pursue responses when there is an absence of student response in a video-mediated L2 classroom?

In what follows, we introduce the research context and data, and the methodological tools of multimodal conversation analysis in the following section.

# 3.  Method

The data of this study comes from a larger dataset that includes video-recordings of $1 3 0 \mathrm { h }$ collected from an online EFL classroom in a preparatory language school in Turkey during two academic terms (September 2020 to January 2021; February 2021 to June 2021), and we present only one short fragment in fine-grained detail. The medium of instruction of the university was English, so the students at the preparatory school took courses to gain necessary English language skills to pursue their undergraduate studies. The focal EFL teacher held a bachelor’s degree in English Language Teaching and had a 4-year higher education language teaching experience including one year of fully online teaching experience during the pandemic. There were 17 students whose ages ranged from 18 to 23 in the online classroom. The students were accepted to the university based on their scores on the nation-wide central placement exam, and placed in different classes according to their English language proficiency levels determined with a university-wide placement test held at the beginning of each academic year. The focal episode that will be analyzed in the next section comes from a pre-intermediate (B1) level classroom. After the ethical clearance granted by ethics committee of the institution, written consent forms were collected from both the teacher and the students. The students attended 20 class hours of fully online English lessons per week through the videoconferencing tool, Zoom. All online classes were recorded using the built-in screen-recorder of Zoom and uploaded to a learning management system so that the students could have access to the recordings throughout the academic year. The researchers were provided access to the learning management system and retrieved the videos upon written consent by the teacher and the students.

Due to the recent pandemic, universities in Turkey moved their educational activities to online platforms, and there were not any hybrid or face-to-face classes offered by the school at the time of data collection. The school institutionally determined Zoom as the primary tool for the synchronous remote teaching delivery. In addition to the videoconferencing feature of Zoom, the teachers commonly used live text chat and screen-sharing features. Although, in the gallery view, Zoom enabled viewing all participants in small frames on the screen, in the focal context, we observed that the teacher used the share-screen feature frequently, which resulted in the visibility of maximum six students (due to the teacher’s preference) in a separate box on the right-hand side of the teacher’s screen (see Figure 1). The teacher did not enlarge or minimize the participants box, and she visibly monitored the students always in cohorts of six. Accordingly, in addition to the oral and written modes of interaction between the teacher and students, the screen recorder captured the teacher’s screen-oriented activities during screen-sharing such as note-taking, page visits, as well as some gestures and facial expressions deployed by the students. Therefore, the data also cover the teacher’s monitoring of the students (in cohorts of six) synchronized with the talk by looking at the list of participants. Lastly, the school maintained an ‘all cameras are on’ policy, and all students complied with this policy.

We use multimodal conversation analysis (CA) as the research methodology to closely examine the data by using the socio-analytical tools of CA such as turn-taking, repair, sequence and preference organization, and embodiment (Sidnell & Stivers, 2013). Adopting a participant-relevant perspective to the analysis of data, CA draws on participants’ meaning-making practices in situ and reveals social actions in the ways that the participants mutually co-construct it in real time. Upon the examination of the fine-grained transcripts (Jefferson, 2004; Mondada, 2018) of the screen-recorded data through an unmotivated looking procedure (ten Have, 2007) in line with the bottom-up, data-driven, and micro-analytic lens of CA, we identified a context-specific sequential environment that includes the teacher’s production of a question and allocating the turn to students by drawing on some screen-based, verbal, and embodied practices. However, the students were not responsive, which compelled the teacher to deploy diverse response-pursuit practices initially to elicit student participation in the pre-allocation phase and then to elicit the preferred response from the participating student in the post-allocation phase. In this paper, we present a single case analysis based on one episode which includes all identified practices in the dataset (see Table 1). We should also note that although the focal case marks a grammar-oriented activity, the larger dataset includes response-pursuit practices during diverse meaning and form-oriented activities. Therefore, the type of activity was not a factor shaping the response-pursuit practices, which indicates another evidence for the representativeness of the extract and the single case analysis.

Single case analysis is a way of presenting CA findings by attending to the micro-level details of focal phenomena in its entirety, and in return gaining a fuller understanding of the interactional unfolding of conversations (Balaman, 2021; Mori, 2004; Raymond & Heritage, 2006; Schegloff, 1987; Waring, 2009). We present the multimodal CA analysis of the extract in two segments (pre-allocation and post-allocation) to better communicate our findings in the following section. At this point, it is essential to note that the single case analysis of the selected extract presents insights into the focal dataset with the similar student profiles and the management of the classroom interaction by the same teacher, which can be registered as a limitation of the study as the generalizability of the findings remain specific to the focal context only.

# 4.  Single case analysis: pursuing a response in video-mediated L2 classrooms

In this section, we present the findings of the single case analysis. We observed that the EFL teacher in the focal context employed a number of screen-based resources in addition to the verbal ones to elicit student contributions when the students did not display any form of willingness to participate, thus when the progressivity of the interaction and instruction was at stake. The findings indicate that the response-pursuit practices were oriented to eliciting student participation when the teacher’s question was left unanswered. The teacher continued operationalizing response-pursuit practices including both verbal and multimodal (i.e. screen-based) ones (see Table 1) until she managed to elicit a preferred response from the students.

In the following extract, we present the EFL teacher’s response-pursuit practices used when there was no student participation after her sequence initiating question (Segment 1; pre-allocation phase), and in the face of inadequate response (Segment 2; post-allocation phase). Prior to the extract, the teacher delivered an extended explanation about the use of causatives by showing example sentences first and then bringing the grammatical structure of these sentences into the students’ attention. Subsequently, the students completed a fill-in-the-blanks activity and started a rewriting exercise. The extract showcases the rewriting exercise, and the teacher shares her screen so that the students can see the worksheet. Below each sentence in the exercise, there is a blank where the students are expected to rewrite the sentences by using causatives. The teacher elicited the reformulated versions of the first three sentences from the students without any troubles in the student participation and wrote them in the blanks. The extract starts right after the teacher read aloud the fourth sentence: ‘She couldn’t do her homework; luckily, her brother was not busy’ (see Figure 1).

![](img/e3e46ecd0728b50bf227e044a5dad1311943ef8bbcd361864b85b29d78ecbde3.jpg)

Having directed the question to the whole class without nominating any students, TEA opens space for bidding. She selects the blank with the cursor to indicate that the students are expected to deliver the reformulated version of the sentence. After $1 . 0 s$ of silence in line 1, TEA writes ‘she’ in the blank first that functions as a clue. Subsequently, she also verbalizes the just typed word, a practice known as writing aloud (Komter, 2006; Balaman, 2018), with a rising intonation in the turn-final position, thus producing a designedly incomplete utterance (DIU) (Koshik, 2002) to invite completion by the students. Following 2.0 s of silence during which there is no orientation to the teacher’s DIU by the students, in line 3, TEA hints at the meaning of the target form (convinced her brother) preceded by a possibility marker (maybe) in turn-initial position. Concurrently, TEA shifts her gaze toward the right side of the screen where the list of the students is positioned in cohorts of six. Thus, she displays orientation to the students’ video frames possibly to identify if any students bodily display willingness to participate. TEA uses the $3 . 3 s$ of silence in line 4 as a wait time for potential bids, but as there are none, she engages in a third position repair and revises her previous question in line 5 (what can we say here) without nominating any students (Badem-Korkmaz & Balaman, 2020). It is followed by another extended duration of wait time in line 6; however, none of the students provides a candidate response. So far in the extract, we see that the teacher has pursued student response by marking the relevant part on the shared screen, writing the first part of target response aloud, using wait time, hinting, and reformulating the question with a third position repair.

Subsequently, in line 7, to further mark her ongoing response-pursuit, TEA fills the silence with a playful and melodic sound, and produces a request for action (come on) that invites student participation. However, this turn design format does not trigger any student responses either. Then, TEA changes the speaker list on the right side of her screen to view another cohort of six students. Having not received any responses from the students again by line 8, TEA provides a linguistic explanation and notes that the action in the sentence happened in the past. In line 10, TEA firstly produces another DIU (she:) and fills the incomplete part with blah blah blah (dıt dıt dıt). After waiting for another 3.5 s of silence, TEA recycles an earlier clue (she $>$ maybe<con<vinced>), marks her repetition explicitly (i’m repeating), waits for 4.0s of silence, and produces another request for action (come o:n) addressed to the whole class (ladies and gentlemen). Following her reference to the whole class and $0 . 7 s$ of silence, she problematizes the lack of student participation mockingly (don’t die here). After $2 . 2 s$ of silence, TEA reminds the students of the time left before the end of their class time as a further means of request for action in lines 18 and 19. The students do not show any identifiable orientations after this reminder, and $4 . 9 s$ of wait time emerges. Subsequently, TEA uses the same request for action format (come on) along with the earlier hint (convinced) and DIU (she) in line 21. Synchronized with this, SUL moves her lips although her microphone is off. SUL’s embodied action marks the first instance of willingness to participate in the extract as a result of the teacher’s deployment of a multitude of response-pursuit practices. In what follows, we see how TEA registers SUL’s embodied action as a potential display of willingness to participate and elicits her participation in an extended pedagogical episode.

In line 22, orienting to SUL’s embodied action in line 20 (Segment  1) TEA immediately allocates the turn to SUL by nominating her and marks this orientation by explicitly stating her recognition of SUL’s action on the screen (you’re saying it (1.4) i- i can see you). Note that TEA did not use any turn allocation mechanisms to select the next speaker earlier, instead, she drew on diverse response-pursuit practices. Therefore, by orienting to the students’ video frames on the videoconferencing tool, TEA identifies a potential next speaker and allocates the turn with an address term. TEA’s turn allocation and explicit marker of her ongoing monitoring of the video frames of the students is oriented with a smile by SUL. TEA marks the closing of her search for the next speaker (huh) in line 23, and SUL takes the floor. Starting with an elongated hesitation marker in turn-initial position (er:), SUL delivers an incomplete candidate answer (she gets:), and 1.4 s of silence emerges. In line 26, TEA initiates repair with a clarification question ( $\mathrm { > }$ are you sure<) and indicates the trouble with a hinting turn (maybe this is past tense). In line 27, SUL repairs her problematized contribution and produces the correct form of the verb (got) accompanied with a smile.

Taking the turn with a discourse marker (you know) in line 28, TEA initially delivers an additional hint by quoting the focal sentence in the exercise (was ↑not (0.2) °busy so°) and cancels it to mark her acceptance of SUL’s answer with confirmation, repetition, and acknowledgement (yes she got huh) while writing aloud got in the blank spot on the shared document. However, SUL’s response, even after her repair, does not include the full sentence in the exercise, thus not the preferred response yet. Accordingly, although TEA has managed to elicit student participation as a result of her earlier action, response-pursuit practices are still in play so that TEA can lead SUL to the preferred response- that is, a full sentence to fill in the blank. In line 30, SUL repeats the correct form of her candidate response so far but does not provide the rest of the sentence. TEA deploys wait time for $1 . 7 s .$ , and then asks a more specific question (who: (.) who did (0.2) her homework↑) to elicit the rest of the preferred response. This question successfully gets a response from SUL (her brother) which receives explicit positive feedback (very goo:d). Also note that TEA displays her acknowledgement of SUL’s response by writing aloud SUL’s answer (her brother) in the blank, thus further indicating that she treats SUL’s answer so far as a preferred response. After TEA’s display of acknowledgement, SUL repeats her answer in a soft voice (°her brother°) in line 36. Although TEA has displayed preference and evaluated SUL’s response explicitly, neither the full sentence has been produced nor the separately produced units has been combined yet, which leads TEA to initiate a pedagogical intervention in situ.

In line 37, TEA reminds the students of the structure introduced prior to the exercises with an explicit grammar instruction episode (↑get (.) ↑somebody (.) to do (.) something). In the turn-final position, TEA explicates her preference for the students’ subsequent contributions with a transition marker (so) in overlap with SUL’s low-volume change of state token (hu) in line 38. After contextualizing the rule by incorporating SUL’s contributions so far in line 39, TEA uses another extended wait time. Seeing that neither SUL nor other students display understanding and produces the preferred response, TEA initiates a screen-based activity that is publicly available to all participants due to the shared screen. She coordinates her screen-based action with her talk and also establishes the relevancy of her action with the ongoing linguistic explanation (let’s look at the rule). Following 1.0 s of silence, in line 43, TEA highlights aloud the focal structure ‘get somebody to do’ with the cursor on the shared screen. Before TEA delivers the rest of the highlighted structure, in line 44, selecting himself as the next speaker YAG provides a candidate response (to her brother) which overlaps with TEA’s completion (to do). We should note that this marks the first instance in the extract during which a student self-selects to produce a candidate answer. Although YAG’s response does not complete TEA’s utterance after the to do part, it is relevant to somebody in TEA’s linguistic explanation. Following 2.3 s of silence, TEA recycles the overlapped part of the structure with a DIU marked with the turn-final rising intonation. TEA’s deployment of DIU prompts SUL’s answer delivery, and SUL produces the incomplete utterance in line 49 (do her homework). TEA accepts both SUL’s and YAG’s contributions with address terms, explicit positive assessments (very good) and a strong acknowledgement token (yes) marked with an emphasis. We discuss these findings in the following section.

# 5.  Discussion and conclusion

Our single case analysis showed that a diverse set of teacher response-pursuit practices were deployed to resolve the low level of student participation in a video-mediated L2 classroom. Turn-allocation in talk-in-interaction occurs either through the selection of the next speaker by the current speaker or self-selection (Sacks et  al., 1974). Similarly, in the focal context, the instructed activity required either the students’ taking/requesting the floor or the teacher’s allocation. However, the teacher did not select a specific student as the next speaker and directed the questions to whole class, thus maximized the interactional space to whole class for self-selection. Previous research depicted how students show their (un)availability to be selected as next speaker or (un)willingness to participate through a number of observable actions and how teachers manage turn allocation procedures (Kääntä, 2012; Mortensen, 2008, 2009; Sahlström, 2002; Sert, 2015) in face-to-face classroom interactions. In this study, on the other hand, we described the management of participation when the students remained silent after the teacher’s question in a largely unexplored interactional setting in CALL literature, namely large group, remote, fully online, synchronous, video-mediated L2 classrooms.

The findings of the single case analysis showed that the EFL teacher’s response-pursuit practices maximized space for student contributions by inviting them to give a response. While Segment 1 depicted the teacher’s response-pursuit moves for eliciting student participation in the pre-allocation phase, Segment 2 presented further practices of pursuing the preferred response after the teacher’s achievement of eliciting participation, thus in the post-allocation phase. The teacher pursued student responses to her questions through various interactional resources (hinting, designedly incomplete utterance, providing linguistic explanation, request for action, reformulation/third position repair, filling silence, explicitly marking lack of participation, addressing the whole class, gazing at the speaker list, using the shared document as an epistemic resource, drawing on students’ multimodal actions, writing aloud, highlighting aloud) to resolve the participation problem due to the students’ lack of response in the relevant slots. The teacher’s constant effort through these practices to initially elicit some contributions and then the preferred response played an active role in managing student participation.

By merits of the unique features of the remote environment, the interactional organization of eliciting student contributions in video-mediated L2 classrooms differed in remarkable ways than face-to-face classroom settings. Although some impediments existed, the teacher managed to strategically utilize the affordances of the videoconferencing tool. For instance, the list of speakers on the right side of the videoconferencing tool Zoom’s interface was used by the teacher to monitor the students’ displays of engagement albeit split in cohorts of six changing on each click. She also exploited the screen sharing feature of the tool for typing and verbalizing the typed item (writing aloud), verbally and physically marking the focal items on the shared document by scrolling up and down and highlighting certain parts (highlighting aloud), and in doing so, designing linguistic explanation and hinting turns based on the shared document. The diverse array of the screen-based activities clearly showed the teacher’s efforts to elicit student participation and then elicit more preferred responses from the participating student (Chazal, 2015; Duran & Jacknick, 2020). Ultimately, apart from eliciting the preferred response, i.e. the grammatically correct full-sentence structure in the exercise, from two students, these multimodal resources enabled sustaining the progressivity of the pedagogical activity and interaction concurrently (Satar, 2015).

Additionally, we also documented that despite the constraints of the video-mediated interactional setting (cf. Arminen et  al., 2016; Heath & Luff, 1993; Oittinen, 2018) and the teacher’s way of managing the classroom in split video frames format, the teacher nevertheless managed to identify a student’s embodied action and treated this as a potential resolution of the low level of participation. Therefore, embodiment emerged as a response-pursuit resource in the focal context. Bringing this into the interaction by nominating the student, the teacher elicited a candidate response from the student and later used it to lead the student to the preferred response by drawing on the screen-based resources. Taken together, these findings show that the teacher drew on the multimodal affordances of the remote setting (cf. Satar & Wigham, 2017, 2020; Wigham & Satar, 2021) as interactional resources which differ from face-to-face classroom-based teacher instructional repertoires. Accordingly, our findings contribute to the growing research body of classroom interactional competence in online contexts (e-CIC) (cf. Moorhouse et  al., 2021). We argue that the rich array of verbal and multimodal (screen-based) response-pursuit practices (see Table 1) should be recognized as original additions to e-CIC features. Moreover, although the low level of active student participation in online classes was considered to be largely associated with students’ tendency to turn off their cameras, the teacher’s extensive effort to pursue a candidate response from the students shows that active student participation may not be only related to the state of turning on/off student cameras (Castelli & Sarvary, 2021). Similar to Hochuli’s (forthcoming) description of non-talking heads in remote classrooms, we explored that the ‘face wall’ structure is not without trouble in active student participation.

Based on the line-by-line analysis of the focal episode, we also identified a number of pedagogical implications directly relevant to CALL. In addition to verbal response-pursuit moves, the multimodal resources were revealed to be invaluable online classroom interactional resources that ensure the dual progressivity of the pedagogical activity and interaction in the L2 teaching setting. The teacher employed these practices concertedly and successively until she finally elicited a student response. The single case analysis also showed that identifying a student’s bodily display of willingness was enacted through the teacher’s orientation to the students’ video frames. Accordingly, we claim that monitoring was possible even in the fractured access to the students’ video frames and should be encouraged in the online L2 classroom interactions. All in all, a teacher’s methods for resolving low level of participation in a remote classroom enabled a closer look into how online classrooms are both complex and interactionally rich CALL domains. Relatedly, we see merit in raising awareness toward such methods described in our study through the verbal and multimodal response-pursuit practices (see Table  1) and other relevant features of e-CIC.

All in all, although we presented a single case analysis based on a specific remote environment, we argue that our findings opened new gates to a fuller understanding of interactional affordances of technology-rich L2 environments and to the role of contextually-configured response-pursuit practices on shaping the interactional organization of online L2 classrooms. Against this backdrop, we recommend that future studies closely examine the interactional patterns in different video-mediated settings in order to bring further insights into online L2 classroom discourse, which may potentially inform the language teaching practices in remote settings, and contribute to the ever-growing research capacity of Computer Assisted Language Learning.
