While pre-service teachers’ beliefs about different dimensions of English language teaching have been widely researched, little is known about their beliefs related to English for Specific Purposes (ESP). This article reports on three Vietnamese pre-service teachers’ beliefs about ESP teaching, captured over a six-month period. Data from semi-structured interviews, stimulated recall interviews, observations, and reflective journals were collected at two critical points in the teacher education programme: the methodology course and the practicum. The findings add fresh insights into pre-service teachers’ beliefs, particularly how these beliefs may change over time. The three case studies presented in this paper illustrate how participants developed their beliefs. The six belief changes identified are then discussed in terms of levels (from no to significant change) and the underlying motives. Implications are also discussed for teacher educators in designing or improving teacher education programmes and for researchers interested in pre-service teachers’ belief change.

# 1. Introduction

English for Specific Purposes (ESP) has become increasingly important in tertiary education in many parts of the world (Basturkmen, 2019). In Vietnam, for example, students at vocational schools, colleges and universities are required to take ESP courses (Trinh and Mai, 2018), to enhance their job prospects within the international labour force (VNG, 2017). However, while research on ESP has increased (Liu and Hu, 2021), the field of ESP teacher education has not received much attention (Basturkmen, 2019). This may be because there are few dedicated ESP teacher education programmes (Constantinou and Papadima-Sophocleous, 2021) comprising specialized courses which are not included in general English language teacher education programmes (e.g., Constantinou et al., 2019; Huttner et al., 2009). Accordingly, despite a great deal of research into the professional development of pre-service English language teachers, little is known about the professional development of pre-service ESP teachers (Basturkmen, 2019).

Teacher beliefs are considered to guide their teaching practices. They are pivotal to teachers’ decision-making during lesson preparation and in the classroom (Levin, 2015), influencing their teaching practices and the learning opportunities provided for learners (Borg and Sanchez, 2020). However, while different aspects of language teachers’ beliefs have been studied since the 1990s (Borg and Sanchez, 2020), insights into pre-service ESP teachers’ beliefs, including how and why their beliefs change over time, have remained largely unexplored.

This article traces changes in pre-service teachers’ beliefs about ESP teaching in an ESP teacher education programme in Vietnam. In line with the literature (e.g., Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000), no change in beliefs is recorded as a belief change. Thus, in this article, when belief change is discussed, this includes the possibility that there were no changes in beliefs. The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of pre-service ESP teachers’ beliefs and of the formation of and changes in their beliefs. As well as contributing to the theory on teacher beliefs, this study will be of interest to other academics and teachers involved in pre-service ESP teacher education programmes.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. ESP teaching

ESP refers to the teaching and learning of English language “where the goal of the learners is to use English in a particular domain” (Paltridge and Starfield, 2013, p. 2) so that they can complete “tasks in their studies or work that have a language component” (Anthony, 2017, p. 10). For example, to communicate with doctors and patients, nurses need specific English language which is different from the language that lawyers need to read legal materials and use in court. Due to these differing language needs, needs analysis plays a critical role in ESP course design (Basturkmen, 2023). In addition to ESP learners and teachers, employers and domain experts have a key role in this process to ensure relevance of teaching and course materials (Brown, 2016; Serafini et al., 2015).

The overall aim of ESP teaching is to enable learners to communicate successfully in their unique academic or professional contexts (Anthony, 2017; Paltridge and Starfield, 2013). In order to achieve this aim, ESP courses mainly focus on the linguistic features of the specialized English language used in specific academic or professional contexts (Orr, 2002), familiarize learners with the use of language in subject-specific contexts (Basturkmen, 2006), and develop learners’ skills in using the language for specific academic or professional purposes (Basturkmen, 2006; Orr, 2002). Although “underlying knowledge” (Basturkmen, 2006, p. 133) or subject knowledge is included in ESP courses, it is not considered as a primary objective of ESP teaching (Anthony, 2017).

There have been debates in the field as to whether approaches for English for General Purposes (EGP) are suitable for ESP with some arguing that “there is no such thing as ESP methodology” (Hutchinson and Waters, 1987, p. 18) and that approaches, methods, techniques and activities used in EGP classes are suitable for ESP classes (e.g., Inomjanova, 2023; Shabani and Ghasemi, 2014). However, others believe that ESP teaching has its own methodology (Anthony, 2017). Those who hold this view argue that teachers are required to flexibly combine methods for teaching the specific discipline with those for teaching English language, as well as using different techniques to deal with distinctive subject content, something that is not required in EGP classes (Basturkmen, 2023; Dudley-Evans, 2001).

To date, research into the complexities of ESP methodology has not received sufficient attention (Basturkmen, 2023; Bell, 2022). The complex nature of ESP means that ESP teachers require additional competencies including knowledge of the subject content that they teach (Górska-Pore˛cka, 2013), knowledge of the subject-related language features used in specific professional or academic contexts (BALEAP, 2008; Basturkmen, 2006), and knowledge of both language teaching methodology and specific discipline teaching methodology (Kenny, 2016). This has led to the contrasting viewpoints as to whether English language teachers or subject teachers are better suited to teaching ESP (Master, 2005). While subject specialists with some English teaching experience are preferred in some contexts (e.g., Feak and Reinhart, 2002), English language teachers are generally believed to be more suitable for teaching ESP courses (Dudley-Evans and St John, 1998; Górska-Pore˛cka, 2013). However, English language teachers may not be aware of the differences between ESP and EGP and how these impact their role. Therefore, understanding pre-service teacher beliefs about ESP teaching is important in supporting more effective initial teacher education programmes for ESP teachers.

# 2.2. Pre-service teacher beliefs

# 2.2.1. Defining pre-service teacher beliefs

Teacher beliefs, defined as “teachers’ psychologically held thinking, conceptions and understanding” about teaching and learning (Zheng, 2015, p. 14), are both implicit and explicit in nature. Beliefs that are implicit can guide teachers’ behaviours and teaching practice without their cognitive awareness (Clark-Goff and Eslami, 2016). However, teachers can also be aware of and able to clearly state some of their beliefs explicitly (Basturkmen, 2012; Ding et al., 2019). Therefore, teacher beliefs are considered to exist in a complex and interconnected system (Buehl and Beck, 2015) and “cannot be directly observed or measured but must be inferred from what people say, intend, and do” (Pajares, 1992, p. 314). In this study, while both participants’ implicit and explicit beliefs are examined, the beliefs that teachers are aware of and are able to articulate (i.e., their explicit beliefs) receive priority over their implicit beliefs.

Teacher beliefs play a critical role in teachers’ professional development and practice. Examination of the literature reveals that teacher beliefs affect teachers in three main ways: their approaches to, and process of learning to teach (e.g., Martínez Agudo, 2014; Wall, 2016), their perceptions of teaching, and their teaching practices (e.g., Borg and Sanchez, 2020; Phipps and

Borg, 2009). Therefore, belief change (i.e., the way in which beliefs change over time) has become an important focus in language teacher education (Borg, 2006; Wyatt, 2018). Given the critical role of beliefs in pre-service teachers’ professional development, gaining deeper insights into their belief changes is essential for teacher educators.

# 2.2.2. Changes in pre-service teachers’ beliefs

On entering a teacher education programme, pre-service teachers will hold initial beliefs about teaching and learning (Richardson, 2003) that derive from their prior learning experiences (Borg, 2003; He et al., 2011). Changes in these beliefs over the course of the teacher education programme depend on the strength of pre-service teachers’ initial beliefs. Some initial beliefs may be “so powerful as to be impossible to change during the short teacher education programme” (Richardson, 2003, p. 12). These prior beliefs may thus inhibit pre-service teachers’ acknowledgement and acceptance of new information and experiences, especially if these are different from their earlier learning experiences (Mansfield and Volet, 2010). However, other studies have recorded significant changes in pre-service teachers’ beliefs (e.g., Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000; Hoang and Wyatt, 2021; Yuan and Lee, 2014) during teacher education programmes, suggesting that some of these teachers’ initial beliefs were unclear, inappropriate (Lortie, 2002; Richardson, 2003) and/or contradictory with the input provided by the teacher education programme (Clark-Goff et al., 2020; Tanase and Wang, 2010). As a result, such beliefs are more susceptible to change, and teacher education can be a key factor in bringing about changes in pre-service teachers’ beliefs.

Research has indicated that teacher education has become an intentional source of pre-service teachers’ belief change (e.g., Borg, 2013; Clark-Goff et al., 2020). New knowledge and experiences that pre-service teachers have gained from their teacher education programmes can contribute to advancing, forming, or adding to their beliefs (Borg, 2011). In particular, knowledge and experiences acquired from the teaching practicum have been found to be more influential in changing preservice teachers’ beliefs than teaching methodology courses (e.g., Debreli, 2012; Tanase and Wang, 2010; Yuan and Lee, 2014). Furthermore, research suggests that there are likely to be individual differences in the development of beliefs (e.g., Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000; Li, 2012; Yüksel, 2014) in response to each teacher’s unique and specific learning and teaching experiences (Fives and Buehl, 2012). Although recently more attention has been paid to changes in beliefs of pre-service English language teachers (e.g., Debreli, 2012; Hoang and Wyatt, 2021), little is known about how and why their beliefs change over the course of their teacher education programme, and no prior studies have explored this process in relation to pre-service ESP teacher education.

Previous literature shows that pre-service teachers’ beliefs can change in different ways. For example, beliefs may undergo no change (Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000) or, in other words, prior beliefs can be confirmed (Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000; Li, 2012; Yuan and Lee, 2014) when converging with newly presented information, or they can be elaborated (Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000) or modified (Yuan and Lee, 2014) when being refined to match with new input. Moreover, pre-service teachers may re-order their beliefs about teaching aspects because they rearrange the importance of these aspects, or reverse a belief when adopting an opposite idea (Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000). In addition, pre-service teachers’ beliefs can fluctuate in terms of strength (S¸ ahin and Atay, 2010; Yüksel, 2014), which means their beliefs increased or decreased in the first half of the study period and changed in the reverse direction in the second half. Nevertheless, it is notable that underlying reasons for these changes in pre-service teachers’ beliefs have not been discussed in depth, and previous research has not addressed the ways in which ESP pre-service teachers’ beliefs change.

# 3. Methods

This qualitative study explored how and why three pre-service ESP teachers’ beliefs about ESP teaching changed over the time of an ESP teaching methodology course and teaching practicum in an ESP teacher education programme. As mentioned earlier, no change in beliefs, or confirmation, is also recorded as a belief change (e.g., Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000). Accordingly, when beliefs were found to be the same as those previously stated, the focus on how and why this happened was maintained to gain a deeper insight into the phenomenon of teacher belief development.

The study particularly focused on the nature of any changes in beliefs about ESP objectives, methodology, and whether a content or language specialist is more appropriate to teach ESP. Three research questions guided this study:

1. What were the pre-service ESP teachers’ initial beliefs about ESP teaching?   
2. What changes, if any, to pre-service ESP teachers’ initial beliefs about ESP teaching could be found after the ESP teaching methodology course?   
3. What changes, if any, to pre-service ESP teachers’ beliefs about ESP teaching could be found after the practicum?

# 3.1. Research design

As Ebneyamini and Sadeghi Moghadam (2018) note, case studies are a useful tool for investigating a complex phenomenon in a natural real-life setting. This study used a multiple-case study design (Yin, 2014) in which the belief system of each preservice teacher represented a case. A multiple case-study approach was used because although teachers differ in their beliefs about knowledge, teaching, learning, teachers and learners, they also share some common beliefs (Clark-Goff and Eslami, 2016). Similarly, although individual beliefs follow different change processes (Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000; Yuan and Lee, 2014), there are likely to be similarities as well as differences in belief changes among the pre-service teachers. The multiple-case study design thus facilitated the capture of the distinctive changes of each participant’s beliefs and the context in which these occurred.

# 3.2. Research setting

The study was conducted in a university where the only pre-service ESP teacher education programme in Vietnam1 was offered. This four-year programme aimed to train ESP teachers for future employment in vocational schools, technical colleges and universities. The focus was on three key knowledge areas expected of ESP teachers: “language knowledge”, “subject content knowledge”, and “pedagogical knowledge” (Górska-Pore˛cka, 2013, p. 31), as illustrated by Figure 1. The first author was one of programme designers, taught courses on reading skills, ESP and English language teaching (ELT) methodology, and was a mentoring teacher in the teaching practicum, but was not teaching on the programme at the time of the study.

The ESP teaching methodology course (i.e., which was just one of ELT methodology courses provided) and the practicum were the focus of this study. These two components, summarized in Table 1, aimed to equip pre-service teachers with the pedagogical knowledge and skills needed for ESP teaching. They were a critical part of the programme, distinguishing the ESP teacher education programme from general English language teaching programmes in Vietnam.

The six-week ESP teaching methodology course comprised two components. Firstly, the theory lesson aimed to provide pre-service teachers with basic knowledge of ESP teaching, including the difference between ESP and EGP, roles of ESP teachers, course and syllabus design, and material evaluation. Secondly, in the micro-teaching session, pre-service teachers worked in groups to choose and teach an ESP lesson to their classmates.

The eight-week practicum offered pre-service teachers the opportunity to observe and teach ESP lessons in a tertiary context. Due to management reasons, not all pre-service teachers could teach real ESP students who majored in subject fields other than English. Some of them had to teach unreal ESP students who were second- or third-year ESP student teachers. Therefore, in this paper, real ESP students and unreal ESP students are used to refer to the type of ESP students that the participants taught in their practicum.

# 3.3. Participant selection

After ethical consent was obtained from the institution where the first author was studying and the institution where the research was undertaken, pre-service teachers were invited to participate in the study. Purposeful sampling was employed in order to select “information-rich cases for in-depth study” (Patton, 2015, p. 264). The three pre-service ESP teachers (see Table 3), whose contrasting beliefs are highlighted in this article, were all final-year students who had completed five ESP courses and two ELT methodology courses in the programme and who were intending to work as ESP teachers after graduation. These criteria aimed to ensure that they would provide comprehensive information and that their engagement in critical reflection would be beneficial to their future career.

# 3.4. Research procedure

Belief changes were traced through two critical phases in the teacher education programme: 1) the ESP teaching methodology course, when pre-service teachers learned the theory of how to teach ESP; and 2) the practicum, when they learned about becoming ESP teachers through practical experiences. As these courses took place in semesters seven and eight of the

final year of the programme, the total data collection time was approximately six months. Table 2 illustrates the data collection process with multiple data collection instruments used.

# 3.5. Research instruments

Four instruments were employed to gather data for tracing changes in beliefs of the pre-service ESP teachers, including semi-structured interviews, teaching observations, stimulated recall interviews, and reflective journals. These instruments are each described in further detail below.

# 3.5.1. Semi-structured interviews

Semi-structured interviews were the primary source of data for this study. Four semi-structured interviews were conducted in Vietnamese: before and after the ESP teaching methodology course, before an ESP lesson, and after the practicum. The pre-course, post-course, and post-practicum interviews covered the same key areas so that comparisons could be made to ascertain changes in the pre-service teachers’ beliefs about ESP teaching over the time of the study (see Appendix A). These interviews largely focused on beliefs about ESP objectives, methodology, ESP teachers’ competencies, and whether language or content specialists should teach ESP, and were guided by the themes discussed in the literature review. Meanwhile, preESP-lesson interviews (see Appendix B) during the practicum were personalized because they were largely based on the individual participants’ ESP lesson plans. Questions for these interviews, as a result, were finalised after the pre-service teachers sent their lesson plans to the researcher. In general, each participant was asked to discuss their plan in terms of lesson objectives and teaching activities.

# 3.5.2. Observations

Unstructured observations were conducted during the Practicum, Phase 2 of the study, when the pre-service teachers were teaching their single ESP lesson. The researcher’s focus was on the pre-service teacher’s decision-making and reactions to unexpected situations. No predetermined categories and classifications were used, and unstructured narrative records were kept to facilitate the post-lesson stimulated recall interviews. Observation data supplemented other data sources to enable the researcher to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit beliefs that guided the participants’ teaching decisions and behaviours, which could not be obtained solely by interviews.

# 3.5.3. Stimulated recall interviews

Stimulated recall interviews (see Appendix C) were conducted, in Vietnamese, with each participant within $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ of them teaching their lesson to assist the participants in more accurately recalling their thoughts and decision-making processes (Gass and Mackey, 2017). Each participant watched the recording of their teaching, stopping at points they considered critical in their lesson, to discuss their actions and intentions and to add any further reflections. In addition, critical points that needed further confirmation or clarification were prompted by the interviewer, based on her observation field notes. These focused mainly on the rationale for the pre-service teachers’ on-the-spot decision-making, their judgements on their plans, and their evaluations of their first ESP teaching experience.

# 3.5.4. Reflective journals

Participants also completed reflective journals (see Appendix D). This helped to record aspects of participants’ belief changes that may not have been identified in interviews due to their ability and/or willingness to articulate their beliefs

(Phelps, 2005). Participants were provided with an individual booklet containing instructions, guiding questions, and space for reflective journal entries at the start of each of the two research phases. These critical reflections could be written in whichever language participants preferred, Vietnamese or English.

# 3.6. Data analysis

The data were analysed reiteratively. Data analysis was initially undertaken simultaneously with the data collection, which helped the subsequent data collection be more focused and efficient. Once all the data collection had been completed, more comprehensive data analysis was conducted with the help of the qualitative analysis software package, NVivo (11). As Vietnamese was used in all interviews and most of the reflective journals, the first author, whose native language is also Vietnamese, translated coded pieces of data into English during the data analysis process. The focus of the translation process was on “generating insightful, credible, and meaningful data” (Marshall and Rossman, 2016, p. 210).

In working across data sources, methodology and time perspectives of triangulation (Paltridge, 2019) were used. The data from the in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted before and/or after each phase were compared and contrasted with data from participants’ reflective journals to gain a deeper insight into their beliefs regardless of whether they were expressed explicitly or implicitly. Where contradictions were found, the context was considered and other sources (i.e., observations and stimulated recalls) were referred to, to ensure that tacit beliefs were interpreted correctly and that an identified contradiction was part of a participant’s belief change process. Due to the primary role of data from semi-structured interviews, the participants’ explicit beliefs that were identified tended to be prioritized over their implicit beliefs.

Data for each participant were analysed chronologically, inductively and deductively, as recommended by Bogdan and Biklen (2007) and Merriam (2009). Within-case analysis started with the first interview to answer the first research question about a participant’s initial beliefs about ESP teaching. This was followed by analysis of the first reflective journal and the second interview, with a view to identifying the participant’s beliefs after the methodology course. This analysis process continued with subsequent data, ending with the data of the final interview taking place after the practicum. A participant’s beliefs at different times were categorized under Objectives, Methodology, Teacher competencies, and Who should teach ESP. These beliefs were then compared over time. The sub-nodes of belief changes emerged as a result of both comparative and inductive analysis of each participant’s data. Under the two broader nodes of Changes after methodology course and Changes after practicum were sub-nodes including Confirmation (or no change), Modification, Fluctuation, Elaboration, Reprioritization, and Reversal, which will be discussed further below.

# 4. Results

The findings on the three cases presented in this article focus on highlighting the most distinctive beliefs that each of these pre-service ESP teachers held and how these changed over time, thus illustrating their different change processes.

The three cases, My, Chau and Tra (pseudonyms), had not learned or taught ESP before entering the ESP teacher education programme. Their initial beliefs about ESP teaching originated from their learning experiences predominantly gained from the five ESP courses provided in the programme. Each participant took three compulsory ESP courses (i.e., English for Mechanical Engineering, English for Electricity and Electronics, and English for Information Technology) and two elective ESP courses (see Table 3). Despite having similar teaching and learning experiences, they each held different initial beliefs which changed in different ways over time.

# 4.1. My: Beliefs formed and strengthened

After the ESP teaching methodology course, My’s initial beliefs changed dramatically to align with her improving understanding of ESP teaching. Initially, she stated that ESP focused on teaching “discipline-related terms and grammatical structures,” and thus ESP should be taught by subject teachers. She also held a belief that ESP required teachers to use specialized teaching techniques which were different from those used in EGP classes. However, after the theory lesson which “provided new knowledge different from what I had thought about ESP,” My modified her initial belief about ESP objectives, stating that “ESP teachers teach learners how to convey their subject knowledge in English language.” Accordingly, she changed her initial belief about who should teach ESP, saying that “English teachers are more suitable for teaching ESP [than subject teachers].” My’s belief about ESP methodology was also reversed after her observation of classmates’ practice ESP lessons. She came to believe that ESP did not need a specialized teaching methodology and could be taught using EGP teaching approaches.

Table 3 Participants’ teaching experiences and elective ESP courses.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Participants</td><td>Teaching experiences</td><td>Elective ESP courses</td></tr><tr><td>My</td><td>Private tutor of EGP</td><td>English for Environmental Technology. English for Nutrition and Food Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Chau</td><td>EGP teaching assistant at an English language centre.</td><td>English for Environmental Technology English for Business</td></tr><tr><td>Tra</td><td>Private tutor of EGP</td><td>English for Environmental Technology English for Nutrition and Food Technology</td></tr></table></body></html>

Practicum provided My with ESP teaching experiences which fitted with the beliefs she formed after the ESP teaching methodology course. During the practicum she observed ESP lessons taught by both subject and English teachers and identified what she considered to be the differences in their teaching. She shared that “whereas the subject teachers mostly focused on subject knowledge, the English teachers’ limited subject knowledge kept them from going beyond developing learners’ language competence.” Hence, My had the impression that English teachers were more likely to help students to attain their ESP learning goals, which confirmed her recently formed belief that English teachers were more suitable for teaching ESP than subject teachers.

The planning and teaching of an ESP lesson to real ESP students in the practicum, which My considered as “real ESP teaching experiences,” also strengthened her existing beliefs about ESP objectives, methodology and who should teach ESP. In the practicum she taught a single ESP lesson about grammar to students majoring in Mechatronics and later reflected that “there was no difference between ESP and EGP lessons regarding the lesson procedure and teaching techniques.” This indicates that she confirmed her belief that ESP teaching focused on the English language used in specific professional contexts, reconfirming the belief after the methodology course.

# 4.2. Chau: Beliefs strengthened and changed

Chau held strong initial beliefs about ESP objectives, learners, and teachers over the time of the ESP teaching methodology course and practicum. She initially believed that ESP courses should be taught by subject teachers to enable English major students to have “deep insight into specific fields” so that they could teach ESP after graduation. These beliefs, originating from her experiences with ESP courses included in the ESP teacher education programme, became stronger after the ESP teaching methodology course. This was reportedly because, in the micro-teaching session of this course, “most of my classmates replicated ESP lessons we had learned [in ESP courses].” In other words, what Chau observed in the course was almost the same as her ESP learning experience.

Chau’s initial beliefs became stronger after she had planned and taught an ESP lesson during the practicum, when she had teaching experiences similar to her own prior ESP learning which had informed her initial beliefs. As her ESP learners were unreal ESP students (i.e., third-year pre-service ESP teachers) who had limited subject knowledge, she focused her lesson on teaching subject knowledge rather than on developing language skills. Her mentoring teacher also encouraged her to explain subject knowledge explicitly. Consequently, teaching this practicum lesson strengthened Chau’s initial beliefs that ESP teaching aimed to provide subject knowledge for pre-service ESP teachers and that ESP teachers should be subject teachers who had expert subject knowledge.

However, while reflecting in the interview after the practicum, Chau changed her previously strongly held beliefs about ESP teaching. This change was triggered by her sudden awareness that prospective ESP teachers were not real ESP learners, as she had initially thought. Instead, she realized that ESP learners were more likely to be non-English major students who had already gained adequate subject knowledge before taking ESP courses. As a result, Chau changed her original belief about the primary aim of ESP, stating that ESP teaching should “focus on discipline-related terms or the language that [non-English major] students will use in their academic or professional fields.” This sudden change in Chau’s belief about ESP objectives appeared to contribute to the later fluctuation in her beliefs about ESP teachers, where she vacillated between prioritizing the importance of teachers’ subject knowledge and their language competence, as well as between who was best to teach ESP, English teachers or subject teachers. These vacillations imply that Chau had become confused as she tried to adjust her initial beliefs about ESP teacher competencies and who should teach ESP, in an attempt to be consistent with her emerging beliefs about ESP learners and objectives.

# 4.3. Tra: Confusion and strengthened beliefs

Tra’s initial beliefs changed dramatically after the ESP teaching methodology course. Initially, she believed that ESP needed “special teaching approaches that should be different from those of EGP.” However, this belief was weakened after the course. She appeared to be confused about whether ESP needed a specialized teaching approach. She shared that “I was not quite sure about ESP methodology” because she became aware that teaching ESP and teaching EGP “are more similar than different.” Additionally, Tra no longer considered that “ESP teachers ultimately have knowledge of the field [that their ESP courses serve]” and that teachers’ knowledge of discipline-specific terms was more important than their language competence, as she stated in the first interview. Instead, she emphasized in the post-course interview that ESP teachers’ knowledge of learners’ needs was the most important, and thus considered teachers’ subject knowledge the least important aspect, after their pedagogical competence.

After the practicum, Tra appeared to hold strong beliefs about ESP teaching which differed from those she held after the ESP teaching methodology course. Changes in her beliefs about ESP methodology and teacher competencies resulted from her active involvement in wider professional activities during the practicum. In particular, Tra observed ESP lessons taught by peers and ESP teachers who were both subject teachers and English teachers, from which she reportedly learned how to explain subject content, involve students, and encourage them to learn independently. Subsequently, in planning her single ESP lesson in the practicum, Tra spent a lot of time researching terms on the internet and locating resources such as pictures, videos, and examples to illustrate the meaning of these terms. With this preparation, Tra’s real ESP students were motivated to explore the meaning of terms in groups, which she believed deepened their understandings. For her, this procedure worked better in facilitating students’ long-term learning than the traditional deductive lessons in which teachers were “knowledge providers” and students were “passive listeners.” Consequently, Tra emphasized that inductive teaching, as part of EGP teaching methodology, was suitable for ESP and that ESP teachers’ subject knowledge and pedagogical competence were of utmost importance.

# 5. Discussion

The findings from these three cases indicate how individual beliefs of the pre-service ESP teachers changed in specific ways after the ESP teaching methodology and after the practicum. Six categories of belief change, including confirmation, fluctuation, modification, elaboration, reprioritization, and reversal, were identified over the study. In Figure 2 below, these six discrete categories of belief change are placed on a continuum, illustrating the degree of stability or changeability of each belief change. For example, confirmation was placed at the stability end of the continuum, indicating that no new beliefs emerged but the existing beliefs might change in strength. Reversal was placed at the changeability end of the continuum, indicating the biggest level of difference between a participant’s prior and new beliefs.

In addition, two main motives fostering these individual belief changes were apparent when analysing the categories of change: (1) the pre-service teachers’ interpretation of the new input, and (2) their perceptions of the similarity or difference between the new input from the teacher education programme and their existing beliefs. This explains why they changed their beliefs in different ways, despite being provided with similar input.

The contrasting cases also illustrate how various new influences were integrated into the beliefs of each of the three preservice teachers. The participants acquired new knowledge about ESP teaching, which was then filtered by the initial or existing beliefs they had previously formed during the teacher education programme. Their individual perceptions of the level of consistency between the new input and their existing beliefs then determined the nature of the changes in their subsequent beliefs. As shown in Figure 3, when convergence occurred between existing beliefs and the new input this led to confirmation and elaboration, whereas when divergence occurred between existing and new beliefs this led to fluctuation and reversal. In addition, in cases where initial beliefs and the new input included both convergent and divergent components, the new input tended to supplement and integrate with existing beliefs and knowledge and, as a result, modification and reprioritization emerged.

These findings are particularly significant because, although previous studies (e.g., Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000; Yuan and Lee, 2014) identified discrete categories of belief change, they did not address the reasons behind these changes in any depth. The current study adds to existing understanding by illustrating how various belief categories arise from different perceived levels of convergence and divergence between the pre-service teachers’ initial or existing beliefs and new input.

Each of the six categories of belief change, together with why these changes took place, are discussed in more detail below.

Figure 3. The primary reasons for different categories of belief change.

# 5.1. Confirmation

Confirmation was placed at the stability end of the continuum in Figure 2 illustrating that although a participating preservice teacher’s belief appeared the same as her initial or existing belief, the belief had become stronger. Confirmation was likely to occur when the ESP teaching methodology course and the practicum provided knowledge and experiences that were in line with and supported initial or existing beliefs. For example, My’s beliefs about ESP objectives, methodology and who should teach ESP were strengthened after the practicum because what she observed and experienced converged with the beliefs she formed after the ESP teaching methodology course. This insight aligns with the findings of Cabaroglu and Roberts (2000) and Yuan and Lee (2014) who also highlight the convergence or consistency between pre-service teachers’ previously-held beliefs and the newly-provided information in describing this change. For My, despite not initially being a significant change, confirmation was important for her development because it showed that she had become more confident in her understanding of ESP teaching. Similar to findings noted by Li (2012), she seemed to feel that she had become more like those who were “knowers of teaching and learning” (p. 51).

As a contrast to My, where confirmation supported her belief development, Chau appeared to be selective when provided with new information, ignoring experiences that did not converge with her initial beliefs. In particular, after the ESP teaching methodology course, her belief that ESP should be taught by subject teachers who could provide subject knowledge was strengthened by her classmates’ peer-teaching lessons. It appears she had ignored the input from the theory lesson which indicated that English teachers are more suitable as ESP aims to equip learners with English language competence to communicate in professional contexts. In this regard, the confirmation of Chau’s initial beliefs did not necessarily lead to belief development, contrary to My’s experience and the process suggested by Cabaroglu and Roberts (2000) and Li (2012).

# 5.2. Fluctuation

In the current study, beliefs fluctuated when a pre-service teacher was wrestling with a perceived divergence or discrepancy between her initial or existing beliefs and newly-provided information from the teacher education programme, as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, this study provides a deeper insight into this belief change than previous studies (e.g., S¸ ahin and Atay, 2010; Yüksel, 2014), in which belief changes were traced quantitatively, and beliefs were found to fluctuate as their strength decreased and increased over the time of the research. This is different in nature from the fluctuation identified in this study, as discussed in more detail below.

As soon as Chau realized that ESP learners were students of different disciplines and the aim of ESP courses was to enable them to use English in discipline-related work contexts, she struggled to create consistency across her beliefs about ESP learners, objectives, and teachers. Nevertheless, her existing beliefs about ESP teachers were too strong to be changed right away. This finding indicates that a pre-service teacher who holds conflicting beliefs may experience what Clark-Goff and Eslami (2016) described as “cognitive disequilibrium or dissonance” (p. 23). In this study, Chau was unable to determine whether she should maintain, modify, or reject her pre-existing beliefs, and that led to her holding conflicting beliefs. Therefore, fluctuation has been placed between confirmation and modification in the continuum in Figure 2 as it refers to the instability in Chau’s beliefs that occurred during the teacher education programme.

Ingeneral, however, fluctuationinbeliefsinthecurrent study tended to bea transitional stage, which implies thatanother belief change might take place after a pre-service teacher gains sufficient knowledge and experiences to support one of her conflicting beliefs. Tra was a case in point as her fluctuating belief about ESP teaching methodology that emerged after the ESP teaching methodology course was resolved after she received sufficient input and experiences from the practicum. Chau and Tra, therefore, seemed to be in a stand-by mode, which is different from “the active process of balancing pre-existing beliefs and present reality” that Nettle (1998) described as belief stability (p. 200). It is possible that Chau and Tra were struggling to mediate a solution to the conflict.AccordingtoBrownleeetal. (2001), evenifpre-serviceteachers espousenew knowledgerather thanactually holdingonto new beliefs, this change is still critical to their learning and teaching during the teacher education programme. In this sense, fluctuation could ultimately be beneficial in the long-term for both Tra and Chau, as the uncertainty they experienced during fluctuation seems to have encouraged ongoing reflection which may impact their future beliefs and teaching practice.

# 5.3. Modification

Modification was placed near the middle point of the continuum in Figure 2, as it represents movement towards a significant level of change in beliefs, as evidenced in My’s case. My integrated her new knowledge that ESP courses enabled learners to communicate in their future work contexts into her initial belief about ESP objectives being discipline related terms and grammar. This integration resulted in a modified belief. My then believed that ESP focused on developing learners’ broader discipline-specific language competence because she was aware that learners could not communicate at work with only the knowledge of relevant terms and grammar. Therefore, modification indicated the alteration of her beliefs about an aspect of ESP teaching, through the integration of her pre-existing belief(s) and the new knowledge and experiences she had gained from the teacher education programme, as shown in Figure 3.

Modification of beliefs about ESP teaching was found to require My to integrate new information into her existing beliefs. Integration thus played a pivotal role in this change as it led to constructive modification of existing beliefs. However, there have been different views about this process in the literature. Cabaroglu and Roberts (2000) identified linking-up as the matching of two constructs with each other resulting in a modified version of a pre-service teacher’s existing belief. However, they did not discuss the rationale for this change process in depth. Similarly, while Yuan and Lee (2014) considered that integration and modification were two discrete categories of belief change, they were not concerned about the difference between new and prior beliefs as a result of integration. Instead, they suggest that disagreement can lead to modification, despite having defined disagreement as the rejection of previously-held beliefs and movement toward new beliefs. In fact, My disagreed with part of her existing belief about ESP objectives, resulting in modification of this belief. Thus, disagreement can be considered as a challenge to My’s attitude toward her existing beliefs rather than a complete belief change, which will be discussed in more depth in Section 5.6.

# 5.4. Elaboration

Elaboration was placed toward the changeability end of the continuum in Figure 2, indicating a significant difference between new and prior beliefs. Tra learned from the methodology course that ESP teachers should have knowledge of learners and pedagogical competence. She was then able to elaborate on the information in her existing belief system about ESP teacher competencies, resulting in her ultimately building a more inclusive belief system about ESP teacher competencies by the end of the study. This example illustrates that elaboration can lead to the expansion, deepening and/or enrichment of existing beliefs when new concepts are encountered in the ESP teaching methodology and in the practicum. A similar change has been identified in the literature (e.g., Borg et al., 2014; Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000) where it is sometimes termed as addition (Cabaroglu and Roberts, 2000) or expansion (Li, 2012). In the current study, the term elaboration is preferred, which is also used by Yuan and Lee (2014), to refer to when a pre-service teacher adds new information or knowledge that they have found useful to their existing beliefs. According to Li (2012), an expansion change indicates not only “a process of knowledge acquisition” but also “an attitude to be open and an opportunity to evaluate the pre-existing beliefs” (p. 51). These features were also found in the way that My and Tra elaborated their beliefs about ESP objectives. However, in these cases, they were both expanding as well as deepening their understanding. Therefore, the term elaboration in this study indicates that a participating pre-service teacher’s belief system can become more inclusive or complex as a result of openness to change. Nevertheless, it should be noted that pre-service teachers may more readily add new concepts to their belief systems when new knowledge and experiences supplement, rather than contradict, their existing individual beliefs, as shown in Figure 3.

# 5.5. Reprioritization

In this study, reprioritization occurred exclusively in the rearrangement of beliefs about the importance of specific competencies of ESP teachers. For example, when Tra considered ESP teachers’ subject knowledge and pedagogical competence as the most important competencies after the practicum, she lowered the importance of their language competence as well as their knowledge of learners. This change implies that Tra’s belief system was comprised of many individual beliefs about different competencies that she believed ESP teachers should have. When she reprioritized a discrete ESP teacher competence, there was an alteration in her beliefs about the importance of other concepts in her wider belief system. This finding is consistent with that of Cabaroglu and Roberts (2000) and Debreli (2012) who identified a similar phenomenon in pre-service teachers’ belief change. Reprioritization was placed between elaboration and reversal on the continuum in Figure 2, because when Tra reprioritized her beliefs, she did not reject her existing beliefs, and still believed that ESP teachers needed specific competencies. Rather, she changed her beliefs about the importance of these competencies due to a clearer understanding of the role of each ESP teacher competency. In other words, as shown in Figure 3, reprioritization resulted from the integration of existing beliefs and the new input from the teacher education programme, a process which has not been mentioned in previous studies on teacher beliefs. As a result, while the perceived priority of some beliefs changed, some priorities could be expanded to include new beliefs. This finding suggests that a pre-service teacher’s reprioritization may reflect increased insights into the requirements of ESP teaching and thus the effectiveness of the ESP teacher education programme in achieving its aim of deepening pre-service teachers’ understanding of the nature of teaching (Eilam and Poyas, 2009).

# 5.6. Reversal

Reversal was placed at the changeability end of the continuum in Figure 2, indicating the most significant change in the pre-service teachers’ beliefs about ESP teaching. This change was identified when a participating pre-service teacher rejected an initial or existing belief and adopted an opposing belief. For example, after the ESP teaching methodology course, My changed her belief that subject teachers were better suited to teach ESP as she began to see English teachers as more appropriate. This finding is in line with previous studies on preservice teachers’ beliefs (e.g., Debreli, 2012; Tanase and Wang, 2010). For instance, Tanase and Wang (2010) reported on a pre-service teacher who rejected her prior belief that teaching was simply knowledge transmission, and adopted a new belief that knowledge could be actively constructed. Thus, reversal suggests a dramatic shift in the pre-service teachers’ beliefs about two conflicting concepts.

Reversal happened when My’s belief system encountered dichotomies, such as a choice between specialized ESP teaching methodology and EGP teaching methodology, or between subject teachers and English teachers. This finding supports the assertion of Cabaroglu and Roberts (2000) that reversal is an extreme form of conceptual disagreement which they consider as a discrete category of belief change. However, the current study views conceptual disagreement as a pre-service teacher’s changed attitude toward an existing belief due to the conflict between that belief and the new input received. Therefore, conceptual disagreement could also be considered as a transitional step that ultimately either leads to belief reversal or belief modification. This insight indicates that, as shown in Figure 3, reversal can resolve a conflict or disagreement arising between the participating pre-service teachers’ existing beliefs and the new information, knowledge or experiences gained from the teacher education programme.

# 6. Conclusions and implications

The current study has shed light on the previously unexplored area of pre-service ESP teachers’ beliefs and widened current knowledge about changes in pre-service teachers’ beliefs. This article has shown how the beliefs of three pre-service ESP teachers about ESP teaching changed in six different ways, including confirmation, fluctuation, modification, elaboration, reprioritization, and reversal, adding to the currently limited literature on pre-service teachers’ belief change. These changes were found to result from reactions to the perceived convergence or divergence between initial or existing beliefs and new input from the ESP teacher education programme. This indicates that pre-service teachers’ beliefs may be open to change when they receive new input, and that their belief development process is comprised of different belief changes occurring at different times in their teacher education programme. This finding, therefore, challenges earlier views that belief change is the “instantaneous process of deliberate confrontation with new, discrepant information” (Tillema, 1998, p. 220).

Through employing a wide variety of qualitative data collection tools, as suggested by the related literature (e.g., Kane et al., 2002; Pajares, 1992), the current study contributes valuable insights to the field of teacher education. Understanding the nature of changes in a pre-service teacher’s beliefs, as well as the process underlying these changes, encourages teacher educators to provide, design or improve their programmes to support pre-service teachers in developing their beliefs over time. As pre-service teachers’ belief change is an important goal of teacher education (Tillema, 2000), positive changes in preservice teachers’ beliefs can be used to indicate the effectiveness of a teacher education programme.

As with all research, this study has some limitations. Although the changes reported here were observed in the three preservice teachers, additional changes in beliefs might be found in a larger sample. Furthermore, as the ESP pre-service teachers in this study did not have prior ESP learning experiences, their initial beliefs about ESP teaching are likely to be more changeable than the initial beliefs of pre-service teachers who are influenced by their “apprenticeship of observation” over their schooling (Lortie, 2002). The time allocated for the teaching methodology course and the practicum was short within this teacher education programme and thus opportunities for these pre-service teachers to be exposed to ESP teaching theory and practice were limited. Therefore, the emerging belief changes noted in this study might not be maintained over time and ultimately later changes may also influence long-term teaching practice. Further research could focus on the following aspects: exploring the beliefs of a larger number of pre-service teachers in different teacher education programmes and other cultural contexts, including the entire duration of a teacher education programme, or even extending the research to include a few years of their initial teaching practice.
