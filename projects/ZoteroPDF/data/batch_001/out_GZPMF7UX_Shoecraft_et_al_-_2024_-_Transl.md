Internationalisation of higher education has increased the number of EAL students studying in Anglophone countries, including Australia. Required English language proficiency tests (e.g., IELTS) do not reflect discipline-specific terminology nor prior learning necessary for successful study. Furthermore, anatomy study, the focus of this paper, requires an extensive terminology, predominantly derived from Latin or Greek, that creates significant learning challenge for all students, particularly EAL students.

This pilot study was based in a large first-year anatomy course at an Australian university, with ${ > } 3 0 \%$ EAL students. To address challenges for EAL students (as identified by teaching staff), translanguaging pedagogies were implemented through repeated cycles of action research. Translanguaging approaches, beyond simply translation of resources, employ EAL students' full linguistic repertoire in the classroom to support acquisition of discipline content and the target language.

Collaboration between the teaching team, a translanguaging expert and past EAL students identified specific translanguaging strategies for implementation. These strategies included a translanguaging workshop for teaching staf, encouragement of students' use of home languages and targeted translated documents. A mixed methods approach was applied to evaluate the implementation. Initial findings show a positive response from both staff and students with additional reflections for future implementation and transferability to similar educational contexts.

# 1. Introduction

In association with ongoing internationalisation, larger numbers of international students are undertaking higher education in Anglophone countries, including within Australian universities (Laad & Sharma, 2021). Concurrently, there appear to be two key misconceptions regarding the expected English language standards for these international students. Firstly, the term Intenationdl is problematic in that international students may speak English as a first language, and similarly some domestic students may speak English as an Additional Language (EAL). Therfore, in this paper we use the term EAL students, rather than the term Inenational. The term additional is preferred (compared to second or foreign) as it encompasses the translanguaging approach of adding language t the individual's existing repertoire. Secondly, EAL students' prior contact with Academic English can be diverse and this datais not accurately caured by E exams, nor dos i accuratly reflet th level f English, disciline-spcific tminlogy, or prior content knowledge necessary for successful first-yer undergraduate study (OLoughlin, 2011). Moreover, eaching staf (and felow students) often make assumptions about EAL students' English ability and, by extension, their knowledge of content.

Generall, discussions on EAL students in higher education take a deficit viewpoint and focus on language dificultie (hang & Mi) 2009) and the English problem (Heugh et al. 2017). This viewpoint is what Ruiz (1984) refers to as language as a problem. To exacerbate this isue, universty courses, including English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses, continue to maintain English-only policies entrenched in monolingual ideologies (e.g., Chen, 2020; Galante, 2020; Willamson, 2023). The impact of English-only policies and learning environments is intensified for students learning and engaging withfirs yer undergraduate anatomy and physiology courses. Introductory level anatomy courses require student engagement, understanding and usage of an extensive, discipline-specific terminology and vocabulary, which can result in information overload even for experienced medical students (Cheung et al., 2021). For example, Lucas et al. (1997), reported that students in a medical anatomy course were introduced to approximately 2000 new anatomical terms in their first 10 wees of semester, with the index of the prescribed anatomy textbook listing approximately 6000 terms.

This extensive discipline-specific vocabulary poses considerable challenge for ll anatomy students, but more so for EAL students, since modern English anatomical terminology has extensive $( 8 6 \% )$ linguistic roots derived from Classical Latin and Greek, in addition to a range of other languages, including French (Turmezei, 2012). Successul engagement and lerning of anatomical terminology are necessary for scaffolding deep leaning, which in turn enhances the students capacit for application and transfer of knowledge to clinical application and pathophysiology (Cheung et al., 2021). Thus, EAL students studying anatomy in English face increased challenges (Kaliyadan et al., 2015).

Experienced anatomy educators at an Australian University, whilst aiming to enhance their students engagement and success with introductory anatomy and physiology study, also recognised the additional challenge experienced by EAL students. These challenges related to students simultaneously learning anatomical content and academic English language skill development which correlates strongly with student performance in health degees (Alhamami & Almelhi, 2021) and anatomy study (Kaliyadan et al, 2015; Langtree et al., 2018). To address this challenge, translanguaging pedagogy was chosen as a potential method for supporting EAL students with their anatomy and physiology study. An action research methodology was adopted to explore how translanguaging could be most suitably applied in the 2023 course offering, and to evaluate the implementation of this approach.

This paper begins with an overview of translanguaging pedagogies as a developing field within educational contexts, ollowed by the methodology for this pilot project. Next, the repeated action research cycles are presented to demonstrate the iterative process for implementation and evaluation of the translanguaging approach - including initial findings of the pilo project. Finally, conclusions are presented with considerations for future implementation and transferability to similar educational contexts

# 2. Translanguaging pedagogies

In contrast to the language defit view mentioned previously, translanguaging approaches view language as a resource (Ruiz, 1984) and encourage the use of EAL students fllinguistic reertoires to acces content and improve their English academic skill (Garcia & Wei, 2014). The creation of translanguaging paces (Li, 2011) can encourage the use of individual students linguistic repertoires, whilst the use of multiple languages in the clssroom can encourage allstudents to engage in meaning-making acros languages, which can be a "transformative experience" (Galante, 2020).

Following the uptake of translanguaging as an everyday practice for multiligual individuals, the focus of translanguaging-based research has tuned to practical applications in classrooms and evaluation of these approaches. For example, Ollerhead's (2019) study on translanguaging in a multiligual, Australian, secondary schol suggested that \*the use of multimodal and multilingual resources effectively interates students' culture and language into classrom lerning, bringing about increased participation, engagement and confidence when doing iteracy work" (p.120). As a relatively recent pedagogical approach, the aplications of translanguaging in classrooms is continuing toevolve. These applications range from Wilims intil application for changing language from one process (e.g., reding) to another (e.g., writing) (Lewis et al., 2012) to Garcias advocacy for social justice approach and the removal of named languages (Garcia & Wei, 2014). As a further example, Cenoz and Gorter (2021) propose a third option in betwen William's and Garcia's approaches.

As the adoption of translanguaging pedagogies continues, expanding niches are being explored across a range of educational context, including higher education. Indeed, recent studies on translanguaging in EAP programs in higher education have explored multilingual students' use of translanguaging practices, as wellas the outcomes of implementing these pedagogies in classroom practice. Chen's (2020) study in an EAP program in Canada found that despite the monolingual ideologies and the English-only policy, Chinese students utilised their primary language in their own learning. For example, they used bilingual dictionaries, took notes in both English and Mandarin, selectively translated new terms and vocabulary into their primary language, and used their primary language during interactions with pers (inside and outside the classrom) to clarify content and support each other. Williamson (2023) reported that hinese international students in an EAP course in Australia utilised simila strategies. Students engaged in these activities despite the monolingual, English-only, policies in existence and the evidence of teachers' resistance to implementing translanguaging practices.

Teacher resistance has been attributed to a combination of their own language learning experiences, belief, classroom policy and institutional constraints (Burton & Rajendram, 2019) as well as a concern that using languages other than English would be counterproductive to the goal of the student successully studying in English (Tan, 2017). Despite teacher resistance to embracing multilingual clasrooms, numerous studies have demonstrated the various ways of applying translanguaging and the benefits of these approaches for multilingual students in higher education settings. For instance, a study reporting on a Canadian EAP program by Galante (2020) demonstrated how translanguaging approaches not only validated students everyday language practices but supported students to develop their understanding of translanguaging practices - as both a resource and to develop their multilingual competencies. Galante (2020) summarised that \*translanguaging opened up possibilities for students to develop metalinguistic awareness about similarities and differences in meaning as well as usage across languages' (p.309).

Within an EAP context in an Australian university, Heugh et al. (2017) implemented a translanguaging approach to writing tasks in an Academic English course. Their study explored the Chinese Mandarin-speaking students' use of a variety of translanguaging strategies in their written work and the correlations with the students' academic proficiency in thir primary language. Heugh et al. (2017) concluded that maintaining a high level of proficiency of academic sills inthe primary language, as well as the development of bilingual proficiency, is benficial for the overall development of Aademic Enlish skill. Furthrmore, bilingual proficiency in future health related careers is beneficial as multilingual translanguaging within Medical English improves patient communication and is important for better patient outcomes (Ortega & Prada, 2020).

Together, the studies mentioned above highlight benefits for multilingual students when they can incorporate their ful linguistic repertoires into classroom practice and their studies. This brief overview of previous studies confirms that a range of methods and approaches can be used for adopting and adapting translanguaging pedagogies to suit leaner and academic context. Importantly, there are also studies emerging that investigate context specific or niche applications of translanguaging practices and approaches in discipline-specific courses in higher education. For instance, He et al. (2016) reported on educator translanguaging strategies in a mathematics education course in a Hong Kong universty. Similarly, Mazak and Herbas-Donoso (2014) documented the translanguaging approach of an educator in a bilingual universty in Puerto Rico. Despite the studies presented here, there is a lack of research (and potentially the implementation) of translanguaging pedagogies in the broader range of higher education contexts (Caruso, 2018), particularl in Austalia (Wliamson, 2023). To further such insights, Langman et al. (2021) have recetly highlighted the lack of awarenes of faculty and students in Science, Technology, Enginering and Maths (M) asto the benefits of utilising their linguistic repertoires in higher education, particularly within the persstent monolingual lens that exists in English education.

The study presented here aimed to contribute to discussions on the benefits of translanguaging practices in higher education specifically to support EAL students learning human anatomy. This niche discipline is recognised for its extensive, discipline-specific vocabulary, that increases the challenge for EAL students beyond academic English skil deelopment, ften within their first semester at university.

The project used an action research approach, that provided the opportunity for an iterative, adaptive approach to implement and evaluate translanguaging pedagogies to optimise student engagement. Moreover, adoption of action research approaches by other educators may further expand the exploration of translanguaging strategies to support EAL student learning within other discipline specific contexts.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Action research

The purpose of action research is to systematicall investigate our own teaching/learning facilitation practice with the dual aim of modifying practice and contributing to theoretical knowledge" (Norton, 2018, p.1). The action research pedagogy used in this project aimed to systematicl inestigate this overarching question: I th translanguaging approach efectve in supporting EAL students when studying human anatomy?

As previously mentioned, the anatomy discipline is well recognised for the learning challenge it generates for l students (Lucas et al., 1997). This challenge is magnifie for EAL students even when they are highly successful academic learners (uch as medical students) (Kaliyadan et l., 2015). Within this project, translanguaging approaches were implemented in anatomical education at an Australian universty to improve teaching practice and better understand and enhance EAL student engagement and approaches to learning another discipline-specific language. To evaluate the implementation of translanguaging strategies, we adopted Arnold and Norton's (2018) IPIER action reearch cycles, using simplified teminology (se Fig. 1). The simplified stps are: (1) Identify ssues, (2) Plan interventions to inform action, (3) Implement action, (4) Evaluate data and, (5) Reflect on learning to inform the next cycle of action.

This project used an overarching IPIER cycle of action research that included the following stages:

Identify challenges that EAL students experience studying Anatomy.   
Plan interventions to inform our action.   
Implement supplementary translanguaging approaches.   
Evaluate translanguaging strategies implemented within this Anatomy course.

Fig. 2. Evolving action research cycles.

Reflect on the pilot project, areas of focus for the next iteration.

The project team realised that multiple IPIER cycles of action reearch allowed for rapid adaptation and change in the course, as per Cresswel's (2012, p.584) assertation that action research \*occurs through spirals f reflection and action'. Thus, each stage of the overarching cycle became an individual cycle, spiralling and connecting to inform the next stage of the overal action research cycle (Fig. 2)

This scaffolded series of action research cycles has sequentially progressed our understanding of the initial challenges experienced by EAL students studying human anatomy and physiology and evidenced the impact of the translanguaging approach implemented. Each of the individual IPIER cycles and their outcomes are described later in this paper.

# 3.1.1. Mixed methods (evaluation)

This project utilised a mixed methods approach to collect multiple sources of data for evaluation of the five interlinked IPER action research cycles described below. This approach is recognised to provide an efective evaluation of the action research project (Cresswel, 2012) as it permits inclusion of multiple voices. In this study, these voices included those from current and pas students, sessional and permanent staff, as wellas quantitative data analytics of students accessing specific course materials.

Qualitative data included focus groups with students and tutors (past and present) and anonymous student responses from a university-wide course evaluation survey. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using content analysis and thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2022). These analyses utilised atranslanguaging lens to explore challenges EAL students experience, specific use of languages and resources, cultural considerations and interactional aspects related to the anatomy and physiology course (A&P) course. Quantitative data on student engagement with translated resources was retrieved from course analytics embedded within Canvas (the Learning Management System). Further details on these methods are presented in the relevant Stages below.

# 3.1.2. Project ethics

This project was approved by the Universty's Human Research Ethics committe (rotocol number 2022/799). All focus group participants volunteered to contribute to the study, after receiving and reading a project information sheet. Each focus group participant provided their informed consent and was explicitly advised that their involvement with the project would not impact their grades or universty standing and that they could leave the study at any time. Focus groups involving past EAL students and sessional tutors were scheduled prior to resource development, whilst current student (2023) focus groups were scheduled afer course grades were finalised.

# 3.2.  Course overview

This project was undertaken within a first-year, introductory A&P course that contributes to 19 undergraduate bachelor's degree programs in Health, at an Australian universty. It is a 12-week core course, often completed in the initial trimester of university transition from high schoo. Successul completion of the course requires all students to learn the discipline-specific language of anatomy.

Over 700 students, on average, undertake this course and learn human anatomy and physiology through a series of six modules of content: 1: Skeletal system, 2: Muscular system, 3: Nervous system, 4: Special Senses (e.g., vision, hearing, tate, touch), 5: Endocrine system, and 6: Reproductive system. Modules are delivered in mixed mode using a combination of on-campus laboratories and tutorials suported by on-line video and technology-enhanced learning resources. Al recorded minilectures are accompanied by English transcripts and lecture slides in portable document format. Additional formative larning activities are embedded within the course site, including an interactive E-learning tool with feedback bult in Articulate 360 that inks visual representations to anatomical terminology for common structures (in English) (see Kenway & Karaksha, 2022).

Students are expected to preview the relevant minilectures prior to on-campus participation in weekly 2-h tutorials, during which they work collaboratively on worksheets and expand their understanding through guided discussions. In addition, weekly 2-h labo ratories in the Anatomy Facility provide students further opportunity to consolidate their knowledge using models and human cadaveric specimens, guided by the sessional teaching team. The sessional tutors' anatomical knowledge was excellnt all achieved ${ > } 9 5 \%$ during their studies), they had all previously taught within the course and were second year post-graduate students in Medicine (at the time of this project implementation).

In the current 2023 cohort (735 students), $3 3 \%$ self-identified as EAL compared to the 2022 cohort (892) and $3 0 \%$ , respectively. Korean and Chinese (Mandarin) were both consistently amongst the most frequently spoken, non-English languages within each cohort (See Table 1).

# 4. Action research cycle descriptions

The proces and intial findings of this action research project are presented through the lens of the IPIER action research cycle - with the five stages explained in the order they were performed, including implementation methods and evaluation of data which informed the reflection and scaffolded the subsequent action research cycle. As illstrated in Fig. 2, these interconnected cycles progressed the project toward the overarching goal of supporting Anatomy learning for EAL students and to inform the overarching question: Is the translanguaging approach effective in supporting EAL students studying human anatomy?

# 4.1. Timing of IPIER stages

Stage 1 was inspired by the convenor and A&P teaching team reflections after completion of the Trimester 1 course, 2022. The team identified that EAL students demonstrated poor understanding of course content in exams, they ofen hesitated to contribute to classrom discussions and appeared disengaged and confused during laboratory sessions. When teaching staff larified if they understood the task, the students explained they were having difficulty with several things: the complexit of anatomical terminology, learning in English and the volume of course content to digest at first year university level. Stage 2 was completed during Trimester 3, 2022 and prepared translated resources prior to Trimester 1, 2023. Stage 3 implemented the translanguaging pedagogy and resources during the course ofering in Trimester 1, 2023. Stage 4 commenced after Trimester 1 course grade publication and included qualitative evaluation of fous goup conversations and quantitative analysi of aces totranslated reources using course analytics. Stage 5 is ongoing as the authors continue data analysis and reflet on the overall impact of translanguaging pedagogies on EAL students' engagement when studying human anatomy.

# 4.2. Stage 1 IPIER - Identify

Identify: Anatomy discipline experts and all students studying anatomy and physiology recognise the significant cognitive chal. lenge for anyone learning the extensive discipline-specific language. After the 2022 course, the teaching team identified that EAL students experienced additional challenges in accessing prepared content and engaging with course activities as mentioned above. This stage focused on establishing the action research project and verifying with an advisory board the benefit of piloting a trans languaging approach to support EAL students learning anatomy.

Plan: An Advisory board for the project including two anatomy discipline experts and one translanguaging expert was formed to discuss, develop, and design the project. This group undertook an early project planning meeting, scoping Human Research Ethics requirements, funding opportunities and potential activities aimed to benefit EAL students. Subsequently, focus group structure and question prompts were identified.

Implement: Human Research Ethics approval was sought and approved, prior to project commencement, along with strategic institutional grant funding for initil resource development. The Advisory board meeting identified and discussed potential trategies for translanguaging and how these may benefit EAL students studying anatomy, with future expansion considered.

Evaluate: The Advisory board supported establishment of the translanguaging project recognising wider potential benefits for EAL students beyond anatomy learning, including psycho-social and emotional responses. Board members considered that despite the initial additional resource burden for EAL students, translanguaging would be a valuable support.

Reflect: Student focus groups were needed to identify the ideal resource types and priority order for content module translation. Timelines and staff required for resource development were planned.

# 4.3. Stage 2 IPIER - Plan interventions to inform action

Identify: Stage 2 aimed to identify how to best implement the translanguaging pedagogy to support EAL students' engagement in

this course.

Plan: This stage used Stage 1's cohort demographic data and planned focus groups with past EAL students and tutors from the 2022 cohort. Korean and Chinese Mandarin were predominant home languages in the 2022 cohort (Table 1). Therefore, students with these home languages were selected to participate in focus groups to investigate the challenges students experienced during the course and to identify existing strategies being used by EAL students.

Implement: Korean and Chinese (Mandarin)-speaking tutors and students from the 2022 cohort participated in focus groups to review the EAL challenge and help inform the translanguaging approach design. Focus groups were held in person and online, with all discussions recorded and transcribed.

The Mandarin-speaking focus group consisted of two tutors and two students, whilst the Korean-speaking focus group included two students. Focus group questions asked participants to: 1) reflect on the leaning challenges they faced whils studying in the course, 2) rate the 6 module in order of diffcult (explaining why) 3 identif which resources they ased the most (both within the course or external) that helped their learning and 4) identify which resources they believed would be most benefical for translation into their home language. The tutors responded using their experiences as students of the course themselves and their observations whist teaching within the course, during 2022.

Evaluate: Past students identified the modules that were the most challenging, which provided a range of responses. Four of the six participants identified the initial skeletal and muscular system modules as a priority due to their large content and vocabulary load, making them somewhat overwhelming. Special senses and endocrine system modules were also considered more challenging by 2 participants as they required a beter understanding of physiological mechanisms. One student explained that these concepts were harder to imagine [visualise] and thus more challenging to understand and remember. The teaching team recognised that complex vocabulary as well as complex systems in anatomy created increased challenge for students, particularly EAL students.

The student and tutor focus groups identified various translanguaging activities they had used to support their own and each other's learning. The translanguaging activities used (and observed) included: writing notes in their home language; using translation dictionaries to explain terminology; watching anatomy YouTube videos in their home language and; sharing and explaining ideas to peers in their home language.

The existing English transcripts of the pre-recorded videos - describing and explaining the required anatomy content - were identified as the most beneficial resource for home-language translation. Participants described how cognitively chllenging and timeconsuming it was for them to fullycomprehend the anatomy content - particularly if translating into their own language for understanding.

Reflect: This stage confirmed that translanguaging pedagogies, utilising home languages to support anatomy study, would likely support EAL students' learning. Furthermore, these focus groups confirmed our original observations that EAL students were already using translanguaging strategies ike those described in previous EAP/higher education contexts (Chen, 2020; Wiliamson, 2023)

# 4.4. Stage 3 IPIER - Implementation of translanguaging

Identify: Following identification of the specific translanguaging strategies for implementation in the course in 2023 (Stages 1 & 2)

![](img/b4ab78ad7a6b4068f2234f43e3ce4a9697dbbc9fba07f0c810a8dc96b50c892d.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Sample of organisation of resources available in the course website.

Stage 3 identified project timelines to ensure timely completion of resource development and planning of project implementation.

Plan: This project aimed to encourage translanguaging practice within clas activities by normalising the expectations and translanguaging practices of the teaching team, EAL students and students with English as their home language to create a supportive culture. This planning fous reulted i provision of a raslanguagg workshop for ssional teching taff (ttors), stf name badges that included languages spoken, and a short introduction about the project to the entire 2023 student cohort.

Implement: The implementation of the translanguaging approach involved four specific actions. These actions were translation of the English transcripts into Korean and Mandarin, delivering a workshop on translanguaging for sessonal tutors, developing name badges for tutors that showed the languages they spoke, and performing an information session for students on the translanguaging approach.

1. Resource preparation: English transcripts of 28 videos, covering 4 of 6 content modules, were translated into Korean and Chinese (Mandarin), initilly vi the auto-translation tol in Microsoft Word. These modules were identified as the most challenging by past EAL students (IPIER Stage 2). The translated transcripts were made available in the course website alongside the English transcripts for the recorded videos (See Fig. 3).   
2. Translanguaging workshop for sessional tutors: To develop a shift from the monolingual mindset to a multilingual translanguaging approach, it was important to optimise students comfort and upport all multilingual students to utilis their full inguistc repertoires in the classoom, not just those from Mandarin or Korean backgrounds. To inform and engage the teaching team with the project, a 1-h workshop was designed and presented by the translanguaging expert. This teaching team included 23 sessional tutors,   
1 academic staf member and the course convenor. The sesson explained the translanguaging approach and rationale using classroom focussed examples (see Fig. 4).   
3. Staff name badges showing spoken languages: Traditionally, the teaching team wore name badges during laboratories, thus any team members who self-identified as bilingual or multilingual could add their known languages to their name badge. This purposeful inclusion of aditional languages further normalised the translanguaging approach and valued multilingual class members and their home languages. Students who spoke the same languages as the teaching team could more readily connect and confi. dently communicate using their home languages.   
4. Introduction of the translanguaging project o students: The translanguaging approach was explained to al students enrolled in the course during a compulsory introductory laboratory session, which included both English and EAL learners (Fig. 5). Students were encouraged to interact with all resources, including translations during weekly wrap-up emails and teaching staff encouraged students' use of home languages throughout the course.

Evaluate: With allsessional tutors participating in the translanguaging workshop, translanguaging strategies were supported positively and consistently acrossall laboratory sessions. The initial translations of video transcripts using an auto-translation tool (Microsoft Word) required review due to dificulties with the translation of anatomical and medical terminology. Select tutors, fluent in Mandarin or Korean, reviewed and modified the transcripts for further accuracy.

Reflect: This translanguaging project went beyond simple translation of resources, as it aimed to influence the monolingual mindset of all involved in supporting EAL students studying anatomy. The sessional tutor raining workshop in translanguaging pedagogy was well-received and helped develop an inclusive and supportive environment for multilingual students. It was recognised that the creation of this type of resource required significant time and budget and future resource development would focus on the explanation of key terminology and core concepts.

4.5. Stage 4 IPIER - Evaluating translanguaging in anatomy

Identify This stage investigated whether implementation of the translanguaging pedagogy was successful in supporting EAL students' engagement in the anatomy course using the following questions:

1) Did students access translated documents?   
2) How did students use translated documents?   
3) How were translanguaging activities encouraged during the course?

Plan: A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the implementation of the translanguaging pedagogy. Quantitative data consisted of course analytics showing the aces frequency for translated documents, in comparison to the number of EAL students identifying aspeaking Korean or Mandarin. Qualitative data was cllate from anonymous student evaluations of the course and focus groups with tutors and students.

Implement: Following the completion of the course in 2023, focus groups were conducted in person and online with Korean and Mandarin speaking students, and sessional tutors. They were recorded, transcribed and analysed to evaluate the translanguaging approach. This paper includes the sessional tutor focus group data (de-identified) from five tutors (4 in person and 1 online). The student focus group feedback and analyses were unavailable during preparation of this article.

The sessional tutors shared thir observations on the 2023 students use of languages and interactions with the translated material. During the focus group, these staff also refected on their own actions, related to the project's translanguaging approach, and their beliefs on its benefits and challenges. This transcript was coded and analysed for specific themes (Braun & Clarke, 2022) related to various aspects of the translanguaging pedagogy implementation. Tutor descriptions, including self-description of their known languages and course teaching experience, is shown in Table 2.

Evaluate: Evaluation of the implementation of translanguaging incorporated both quantitative and qualitative data analyses, which are reported separately below.

Quantitatie data reporting the number of students acesing the translated video-transcripts and the number of page views for each translated module topic were obtained via the course analytics within the Canvas learning management platorm. Data from Korean and Mandarin-speaking students were combined, and the average number for each are presented for each human body system (Module) translated and shown in Table 3.

49 EAL students, who spoke either Korean or Chinese Mandarin were identified using course site data (see Table 3) and represent the maximum number of students speaking these languages. It i important to note that students may also speak English and their home language fluently and it was not possible to differentiate this group.

Although the number of transcripts translated for each module diffred, the initial two modules, Skeletal and Muscular systems, were accessed most frequently by more students on average, as evidenced by the average number of page views and average number of students acessing transcript, respectively. This confirmed Cycle 2 evidence that past EAL students rated these systems as more difficult.

Additionally, past EAL students identified special senses and endocrine system modules as also being challenging. These latter transcripts were also accessed during the course but not as frequently. Almost $2 5 \%$ of the EAL students continued to access the translated resources throughout the trimester, although the number of page views fell by almost $6 0 \%$ . Therefore, the availability of transcripts may have provided a time-saving strategy early in the course, for modules with additional terminology, whilst students may have become more confident with anatomical terminology later in the course, particularly in modules with fewer unfamiliar anatomical terms.

# 4.5.2. Qualitative data

Qualitative data for this intial reflection process was collated from comments in anonymous student evaluations of the course and the tutor focus group after course completion.

4.5.2.1. Anonymous student evaluations on the course. Allstudents within the course were invited to fer anonymous feedack viathe standardised university-wide Survey of Student Experience at the completion of each course. This university-managed process does not permit dfferentiation of EAL student reponses from the cohort. Furthermore, despite no specific questions regarding this project being asked, students offered the following unsolicited feedback regarding their experience.

Multiple resources and learning options for students. I think it is very lovely that there are also options for those that have english as their second language".

"I was blown away with the effort that had been put into creating the course content. The Video's, lesson plans, booklets and translations were some of the best teaching aids I have ever seen".

"As an international student, it was so good to have the lecture scripts'.

"Translated script helped me to save time so much!!! I really appreciate it" (emphasis added).

# 4.5.2.2. Tutor focus group

The five tutors expressed general enthusiasm, despite some initial concerns, for the translanguaging project. They confirmed it encouraged their noticeable reflection on their understanding of learner diffrences and interactions with students, whilt increasing their awarenessof students' use of languages. Tutors discussed their conversations with EAL students regarding use of the translated resources and they actively encouraged students to use their home languages.

4.5.2.3. Interactions with students. Tutor name tags with their spoken languages identified were recognised as helpful for connecting and engaging with other sessional staf and EAL students. For example, the name tagstimulated student questions about their language, and appeared to increase EAL student willingness and confidence in speaking about their own languages and selves with the

tutors, further building confidence and rapport.

The name badges potentally encouraged one specific student to talk to Tutor 1 (Mandarin speaking) about being from Korea but having studied in China. This student was observed making notes in both Korean and Chinese (detailed further below). An additional comment on building rapport was made by Tutor 4 who mentioned speaking Spanish with one student. \*They were very, very good in English, so it was really just for fun'. Tutor 4 continued to say it was a nice way of including students' home languages.

4.5.2.4. Learner diferences. During the focus group, the tutors mentioned how the project encouraged them to consider and action assistance for EAL students. For example, tutors had made several adjustments to support one Korean-speaking student who had struggled with the course work. These actions included offering to provide further explanations a the end of classand translating key ideas in a Korean conversation. Ultimately, the tutors recommended that the course convener facilitate the student transferring into a tutorial led by Korean-speaking tutor (Tutor 3). That tutorial also provided the student more opportunity to engage in the content due to smaller class size.

Although noticing improvement in the student's understanding of the course content, the tutors observed the student continued to experience dificulties. These observations resulted in considered discussion that perhaps factors other than language may be impacting the student. This reflection on individual learner differences was the result of their heightened focus on translanguaging, informed by their observations of comparisons with other Korean-speaking students who were not experiencing the same levels of difficulty in the course.

The tutors also commented on cultural differences that could affect students engagement in the course, particularly with speaking up during laboratories and tutorials. For example, Tutor 3(Korean-speaking) commented that Koreans are generally very introverted, prompting Tutor 3 to express their desire to find ways to encourage these students to participate more actively in class.

4.5.2.5. Increased awareness. Completion of the translanguaging workshop, and participation in the project supported the tutors to develop an awarenes of students existing practices with multiple languages, as well as more reflection on cultural dfferences. The tutors talked about noticing students using other languages in their notes. Tutor 4 explained that when they noticed students drawing diagrams and writig the labels in other languages, they would sugest that the students add the English as well This tutor would also encourage pair and group discussin in other languages: "[use] whatever language is comfortable for you, use that, but always bring it back to English'. Tutor 4 was quite incredulous that they had never noticed this use of other languages before:

I've taught here for seven years now. And this was the first year, I was like oh wow, people are writing notes in other languages and diagrams in other languages. Wow. How have I not picked up on that. I've probably taught, what, probably going on 10 thousand students now, and I've only just started noticing."

Tutor 5 commented that the use of idioms and analogies to asist learning anatomy was very useful for Australian students. However, for EAL students:

these sorts of tols, often tend to get lost i translation, um, because the default is that they try and literally translate what said. And i doesn't make any sense. Because all of a sudden I'm starting to talk about elephants, and it's you know and, they're so confused."

This discussion on the benefits of analogies for local, Englis-speaking students and the chllenges they posed for EAL students led to reflections on additional resources to include in the course.

Tutor 2 made interesting observations about a group of Korean-speaking students in their laboratory sesson. This group would generallytlk to each other quite actively- in Korean and English. One member of this group was very confident in their work and had a high level of English. The tutor said that on one occasion this student did not how up and the rest of the group were dead quiet. The tutor reflected that, because they're from the same background, they're more like willing to speak Englishcontent t each other... [which gives] the confidence of actually speaking".

1.5.2.6. Obserations o students use of translated resources. The tutor in the focus groupnoted students were teling them how useful he translated documents were, or specifically how they used them to support their own study. Tutor 2 said,

I was getting told that they would usually, like, skim through the long Korean transcripts before actually looking at the lecture because, because it's the native language you can skip through it really quickly and get a reall brief understanding of what's happening. And once they have that understanding the English lecture makes more sense to them. Because when they don't understand certain words, they can kind of guess based on the content they already know, like what this is about. So they would just do a quick scan.

Tutor 2 continued to say that these students were using the English transcript to study, but skim reading the translated documents Jave them confidence. This sentiment of building confidence was reiterated by Tutor 3, who continued tosay that they were concerned he translated documents wouldn't help students achieve the required university standard, but:

"getting that feedback [on the helpful translations] helped me realise that, you know, it's till reaching that same standard but it's just putting a few more, staircase . stepping stones in between. It makes it easier to, to reach that same standard."

he tutors noted that students with other language backgrounds (for example, Vietnamese) were asking if they could have the documents translated in their languages as well as they recognised the benefit of these translations for increasing understanding. Reflect: At this reflection stage, the data presented above were used to answer the following research questions.

4.5.3. Question 1. did students access the translated documents?

Based on the data available in the course site (Table 3), between 12 and 19 Mandarin and Korean students (of 49) were accessing the translated documents and continued to do so throughout the course. The unsolicited responses in the student evaluation data and comments from the tutors also indicated that students were accessing and valuing these resources.

4.5.4. Question 2. How did students use the translated documents!

According to the tutors' observations and interactions with students, the translated documents were used to support students understanding of the related content. Student evaluation data mentioned how the transcripts saved time, supporting tutor observations that students usedthe transcripts to get the gist ofthe module content before engaging in videos and transcripts in English. Therefore, assuming the students spent lesstime focused on translating the English anatomy content they used the opportunity to use other strategies, such as inferencing, to learn the content. Building students' confidence was another important observation of how students engaged with these materials. Self-belief (leading to increased motivation) is akey factor in learning, specificall language learning (Eisenchlas & Shoecraft, 2023) and potentiall provided aditional support to EAL students engagement in the course. As noted by Tutor 3, it appears that these translated documents were additional caffolding (or stepping stones) to support EAL students i reaching the standard expected at university. In other words, these translated documents helped the project aim, to level the playing field.

4.5.5. Question 3: How were translanguaging activities encouraged during the course?

The insights offred by the tutors provided evidence of a developing translanguaging culture as identified in several ways. Tutors were more aware of the language practices of students and actively encouraged them to continue and build on these practice, such as speaking to prs or tutors in home languages to clarify meaning, using home languages to make note, ading English descriptions with translations of terminology and diagrams. Furthermore, students utilising these multilingual resources were potentially becoming more aware of their own linguistic practices.

These initial reflections, afer analysis of the presented project data, will be expanded in future, to include reflections from th analysis of student focus groups, to provide further insight into the EAL students' use of the multilingual resources.

4.6. Stage 5 IPIER - Reflection on learning to inform the next cycle of action

Identify: This stage identified future action reearch cycles for 2024, to investigate modification of translanguaging implementation and additional data sources to investigate EAL students' engagement and prior experience studying in English.

Plan: The teaching team used the data to inform initial reflections to improve future translanguaging implementation.

Implement: Stage 4 data were analysed for key emerging themes and results to indicate the efectiveness and impact of specific translanguaging strategies. This cyclical action research evaluated the original initiative and informed reflcive design modifications to progress and improve the strategies for continuation of this translanguaging project in 2024.

Reflect: Together, this partnership sought to level the playing fied for EAL students studying anatomy whilst incresing teaching staf and non-EAL student awareness of the additional chllenges experienced by EAL students. This approach was consistent with the transformative principles of action research (Creswell 2012). Active inclusion and proect information sharing betweenal teaching staff,convenor, and the student cohort for the course over the teaching trimester influenced attitudes and response to supporting AL students.

Five key emerging themes were identified from this project. First, existing translanguaging practices of EAL students were enhanced by explicitly implementing translanguaging pedagogy within the cohort. This is evidenced by student use of the translated documents in a variety of ways depending on the individual), and the tutors' acceptance and encouragement of EAL student's languages to support their engagement and learning. Next, the project supported development of a more inclusive clas culture, with heightened awareness of students' languages helping teaching staff transition from a deficit, monolingual viewpoint. Indeed, the additional languages were valued and celebrated, via name badges, interactions, and translated documents. A third feature was an increased awarenes that individual learning differences and cultural differences may influence EAL students engagement/success in class was evidenced by tutor discussions. Fourth, document translations were beneficial for individuals with these specific home languages but is predictably not sustainable for all languages and/or course resources. That said, students from other language backgrounds commented that they would also like translations of key concepts and terminology in their languages. These students did not appear to feel disadvantaged, but rather recognised the benefit of these types f resources. The proect's deliberat restriction of translation to the core learning resources that are subject to minimal change over time, aims to enhance long term sustainability and potential for inclusion of aditional languages. Finall, additional demographic data collection from students in 2024, is needed to better inform utilisation and impact of translanguaging support for improving anatomy learning engagement and success.

These initial reflections identified potential project changes for implementation in the following year and wil be further reviewed following completio of student focus group (2023) analysis. Firstly, the translanguaging pedagogy and approaches described here wil continue, with additional emphasi n cultural differences in EAL student engagement prioritie. The Advisory Board, informed from 2023 EAL student feedback, will consider additional language translations and consider whether additional translated resources are needed. New resources such as a guide to common analogies used in anatomy learning may be developed, to asst tutors and students, including EAL learners. Finally, the research team will identify and review additional student data sources to expand their investigation of translanguaging implementation and its impact on anatomy learning success.

# 5. Conclusion

This paper describes the authors journey of developing an evolving, ongoing action research project to support EAL students in a first-year anatomy course in an Australian university. As outined, the action research process was not simple and involved a progressive and sequential series of action research cycles. These cycles informed reflexive adaptation and improvement of our understanding of the EAL learner and educator perspectives in applying translanguaging pedagogies to support student engagement in anatomy learning. This is acontinuing project that aims to support and improve classroom experiences and learning outcomes for EAL students in the A&P course. In the longer term, this action research may contribute to developing a model for applying translanguaging to support EAL students within other universty courses that require extensive technical language. The translation of specific resources should be targeted where applicable (and viable) for course content that i highly technical (such as anatomy) and unchanging through future course iterations, to maximise sustainable and affordable EAL student support.

Arnold and Norton (2018, p. 5) stated that, \*in addition to evaluating actions, action research should raise questions, and change and challenge the assumptions that underpin practice'. The translanguaging pedagogical approach presented here challenged the monolingual bias that is often present in English peaking countrie (articularly in Australia). Participants in the project developed an awarenes of students' linguistic repertoires and recognised individual diffrences (both cognitive and cultural. This approach encouraged educators, as well as students,to shift away from a defit view of EAL students to a strength-based aproach that valued and celebrated languages and cultures to maximise the benefits of their multilingual superpower.
