# ‘Discourse communities’ and ‘writing apprenticeship’: an investigation of these concepts in undergraduate Education students writing

Robyn Woodward-Kron University of Wollongong, Australia

# Abstract

This paper examines the concepts of discourse community and writing apprenticeship in the context of undergraduate education students’ writing. Drawing on an integrated research methodology using marker feedback on student assignments and interview data, the paper addresses to what extent the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship can be applied to the disciplinary context of teacher education. The findings suggest that tertiary literacy practitioners need to be critical in adopting these concepts to specific disciplinary contexts, but also that the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship provide rich contextual frameworks for investigating the social practices that shape students’ writing. Furthermore, this paper provides a detailed methodological framework for exploring the extent to which marker feedback attempts to socialise students’ writing to the discursive practices of the discipline.

# 1. Introduction

For researchers into student writing, the concept of discourse community provides an important means of exploring the social practices that shape students’ writing. According to Hyland and Hamp-Lyons (2002) one problem with the concept of discourse community, however, is that researchers and practitioners have difficulty in conceptualising the participants, texts and knowledge building practices that contribute to a discourse community. This has implications for the extent to which academic writing teachers can fruitfully adopt the concept of discourse community to contextualise student writing. Without adequate means of conceptualising a discourse community, academic writing teachers also risk making connections and generalisations about student writing that may be inaccurate and misleading for specific disciplinary contexts.

This paper aims to contribute to current understandings of the relation of discipline specific undergraduate student writing to its discourse community. It also aims to provide a methodological framework for exploring some of these relations. The context of the research is undergraduate teacher education in a Faculty of Education at one Australian university. The research methodology is an integrated one incorporating linguistic analysis of the tutors’ feedback on the students’ writing, and interview data with students and their tutors. While the majority of participants in the study are of English speaking backgrounds, the findings have relevance for tertiary literacy practitioners working primarily with English speaking background students as well as for EAP practitioners working with non English speaking background (NESB) students. A better understanding of the variables, tensions, and practices impacting on discipline specific student writing can provide valuable contextual information for literacy teachers working with students and academics in discipline specific contexts. Such knowledge is also valuable for practitioners such as EAP teachers working in language centres who have little access to disciplinary contexts, but who nevertheless strive to provide an accurate social framework for their teaching of academic writing.

The main questions addressed in this paper are:

(i) What is the relation of the students’ writing to the mature discourse community of the discipline? When considering the writing of trainee teacher students, how relevant are the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship?   
(ii) In their marker feedback on students’ assignments, do the tutors attempt to influence the students in any socialisation process?

# 2. Literature overview

The following section provides an overview of the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship and their application to the tertiary learning context. The role of marker feedback in inducting students into a discipline’s discursive practices is also considered.

# 2.1. Discourse communities

In research into academic discourse, academic disciplines are frequently described as discourse communities (for example, Bazerman, 1988; Berkenkotter,

Huckin, & Ackerman, 1991; Bizzell, 1982, 1992; Swales, 1990). The term discourse community foregrounds the linguistic and contextual dimensions of disciplinary knowledge. Members of academic discourse communities are seen to share certain language using practices, canonical knowledge and approaches to interpreting experience (Bizzell, 1992). While members may have shared beliefs, academic discourse communities are unlikely to be homogeneous sites of consensus. As Bazerman (1992) has pointed out, they are more likely to be sites of ‘‘heteroglossic contention’’ (p. 63), as researchers debate the merits and shortcomings of research findings and theories. These knowledge building practices have important consequences for the ways in which language is used to make knowledge claims. Professional academic writing involves mobilising a range of linguistic resources to negotiate with prior texts and persuade the community to accommodate new and possibly conflicting claims (Bazerman, 1992; Hunston, 1994; Hyland, 2000). One concern of this paper is whether these discursive practices are considered to influence student writing.

Hyland and Hamp-Lyons (2002) caution against framing discourse communities as static, autonomous and predictable. The discursive practices of a discipline can be influenced by a broad spectrum of participants. For example, discourse communities can include vocationally oriented participants such as school teachers as well as academics involved primarily in research. Furthermore, participant engagement within the discourse community can vary considerably as can duration of participation. Undergraduate Education students studying to be teachers, for example, may only briefly experience the discipline of Education as a field of study, a discipline which in itself includes other disciplinary strands such as Sociology, Psychology and the Philosophy of Education. While the concept of ‘community’ suggests belonging, consensus and homogeneity, the variety apparent in the Education context is a recurring theme in several ethnographic studies into specific disciplines, as are issues of power relations, and exclusion (Casanave, 1992; Prior, 1995; Starfield, 2001). These ethnographic studies provide a critical dimension to the concept of discourse community by bringing to the foreground the complexity of social relations in these contexts.

# 2.2. Learning the discourse of a discipline: The apprenticeship metaphor

Much of the research into how students experience and learn the discursive practices of their disciplines draws on the metaphor of apprenticeship (for example, Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Drury & Webb, 1991; Freedman, 1987). The apprenticeship metaphor implies that students work together with an experienced member of the discourse community in order to learn the specialist disciplinary ways of meaning. This process has been interpreted as similar to the one Lave and Wenger (1991) describe as ‘legitimate peripheral participation’ in communities of practice. The result of the apprenticeship process would be that students gradually shift from peripheral participation to become fully-fledged members of the discourse community.

Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995) adopt the apprenticeship metaphor and refer to the process of disciplinary learning as a ‘cognitive apprenticeship’. They contend that the learning of disciplinary genres is similar to the process of second language acquisition, ‘‘requiring immersion into the culture and a lengthy period of apprenticeship and enculturation’’ (p. 13). However, Berkenkotter and Huckin argue that while the cognitive apprenticeship model is valid for graduate students, it does not accurately describe the ways undergraduate students experience the disciplinary discourse. According to Berkenkotter and Huckin, this is because undergraduates mostly learn via pedagogic genres, genres which only share some of the features of the disciplinary genres.

Berkenkotter and Huckin’s cognitive apprenticeship model has been criticised by a number of researchers, as has the apprenticeship metaphor. Belcher’s (1994) research into the writing environment of graduate students has caused her to question the validity of the concept of cognitive apprenticeship. She argues that within the cognitive apprenticeship model mentors are considered to automatically model the discipline’s discursive practices. Belcher reports, however, that some graduate advisors fail to provide the necessary scaffolding for graduate students. Similarly, Candlin and Plum (1999) argue that the validity of the apprenticeship metaphor needs to be tested by considering participant accounts and perspectives. In their study of undergraduate Psychology students, Candlin and Plum found little evidence in the students’ focus group discussions that students considered themselves as being ‘apprenticed’ in the discipline of Psychology. Candlin and Plum conclude that the psychology students in their sample lacked opportunities for any legitimate peripheral participation. These findings are echoed by Gollin (1998) in her study of computing students’ writing. Candlin and Plum (1999) propose the term induction to describe the mediated but not unproblematic process of educating undergraduate students in the discursive and epistemological practices of the disciplines.

# 2.3. The role of marker feedback

One practice that can influence students’ induction into a discipline’s discursive practices is providing marker feedback on student assignments. Providing marker feedback is an opportunity for the experienced members of the discourse community to frame the discipline’s discursive practices for novice participants (Plum, 1998; Spinks, 1998; Tang, 1999). Spinks (1998) found that in her data collected from Psychology, some tutors’ comments encouraged students to identify with psychology as an intellectual community by engaging with issues and taking risks within the discourse.

While marker feedback can play a socialising role in students’ disciplinary learning, it is also likely to restrict and exclude ways of writing which are not valued by the discipline. The distinctive ways in which discourse communities construct knowledge raise questions about the extent to which their discourses can exclude the prior experiences of novice participants, particularly those who may not share the same beliefs and values of the discourse community. Lillis (1997) found that academic discourse marginalised her non-mainstream students and their experiences, findings that have been echoed by Cadman (1997); Casanave (1992); Farrell (1996, 1999); Ivanicˇ (1998) and Ivanicˇ and Simpson (1992).

# 3. The institutional and disciplinary context of the study

The data for this research into the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship are drawn from a naturalistic, longitudinal study into students’ writing development undertaken in a Faculty of Education at one Australian university from 1999 to 2001 (Woodward-Kron, 2002). The university attracts a considerable number of non-English speaking background (NESB) students. While the number of NESB students enrolled in primary teacher Education at the time of the study was small, demographic data collected by the Faculty indicate that approximately one third of the 1997 and 1998 students enrolled in Primary Education were from lower socio-economic backgrounds. In the Education Faculty, considerable attention is given to the development of the students’ literacy. The researcher observed that the Education academics attempted to encourage critical thinking through their choice of assignment tasks and learner-centred approaches to pedagogy. The Faculty also attempted to make its writing requirements explicit by incorporating writing guidelines and assessment criteria in the Faculty Handbook. Discussions with tutors indicated that explanations about writing requirements were frequently initiated in tutorials by the tutor before writing assignments were to be submitted.

# 4. Design of the study

In research into student writing, text analytical approaches have been combined with ethnographic research to investigate the assumptions that inform tutors’ approaches to student writing (Hewings, 1999; Hyland, 2000; Ivanicˇ, 1998; Lea & Street, 1999; Plum & Candlin, 2002). In order to investigate the relations between the Education students’ writing and that of the mature discourse community, an integrated research methodology was adopted. The main data to explore the influence of the Education tutors on the students’ writing is marker feedback on fortyfour first year essays written in March 1999, and forty-four essays written by the same students in June 1999. The marker commentary is analysed using an analytical framework informed by Halliday’s (1979, 1994) metafunctional model of language. The marker commentary data are supplemented by interview data conducted with five tutors as part of the longitudinal study. Four of these tutors marked the essays referred to in this study. In addition, interviews were conducted with seven of the forty-four participating students in the first year of the study and with three of the seven interviewees in the third year of the study. For logistical reasons, two of the three third year interviews were conducted via email. The third year interviews are drawn on in this paper to provide a student perspective on the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship. The discrepancy in time frames of the data allows for the interviews to provide a reflective account of the participants’ perceptions of the discipline’s discursive practices. The marker feedback provides a snapshot of how these practices were realised at one stage of the students’ studies.

# 4.1. Description of the marker commentary data

This student cohort were recruited in a core first year subject, Education 1 (Child Growth and Development) according to ethics guidelines which stipulated the condition of anonymity for the participating students and their tutors who marked the assignments. The students’ texts were collected and photocopied after they had been marked and graded. The assignment questions and grades awarded are shown in Table 1. The grading scale used by the Faculty is: $\mathrm { P a s s } = 5 0 – 6 4 \%$ (P); Credit $=$ $6 5 \mathrm { - } 7 4 \%$ (C); Distinction $= 7 5 \mathrm { - } 8 4 \%$ $( \mathrm { D } )$ ; High Distinction $= 8 5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 \%$ (HD).

No demographic data were available for the student participants. However, lexicogrammatical choices in the students’ texts suggest that all the participants in the study were fluent speakers of English. Conversely, the surnames of a considerable proportion of the participants suggested that they were second generation NESB migrants.

The marking of the cohort’s essays was shared between four tutors who are identified with the pseudonyms Mike, Pat, Kasia and Therese. The term ‘tutor’ is used in this paper to reflect the participants’ function in the tutorials. All the tutors taught in the first year subject and all had considerable experience teaching in the core strand of subjects. Pat, Kasia and Theresa had long held their doctorates and Pat was a senior faculty staff member. Kasia was a NESB academic. Theresa was a semi-retired faculty member. The tutors were aware of the researcher’s intention to copy a selection of the students’ essays prior to marking; however, they did not know which students’ essays were to be collected.

# 4.1.1. Description of the marker commentary analytical framework

The analysis of the marker feedback distinguished between the tutors’ marginal comments and their summarising comments. ‘Marginal’ refers to annotations which the tutors added in the margins and text of the student assignments. ‘Summarising’ refers to concluding comments accompanying the grade at the end of the student assignments.

Marker commentary that attempts to socialise students towards the discursive practices of the disciplines is likely to attend to a range of lexical and grammatical choices across several dimensions. One dimension is the representational aspect of language: how students represent, define, classify, establish causal relations, and so on through language. Another dimension is the interpersonal: that is, how students use language to interact with their reader, to negotiate meanings, evaluations, and so on. A third dimension is the way students use language to organise their meanings, their arguments, propositions etc. into texts. In order to distinguish the types of meanings the markers attended to in their comments, the analysis was informed by Halliday’s (1979, 1994) metafunctional view of language. Halliday (1979) describes the semantic system of language as being organised into systems which correspond to the functions that language has evolved to serve. Halliday refers to these functional modes of meaning as experiential, interpersonal and textual. An analytical framework that distinguished between these types of meanings was developed. This framework is elaborated below with examples from the students’ texts. Marker commentary which attended to punctuation features and spelling was not included in the analysis, nor were broader comments on the issues covered in the students’ essays.

4.1.1.1 Experiential meanings. Analysis of marginal marker commentary attending to experiential meaning in the student assignments pointed to two types of intervention. These interventions were categorised as either replacement or augmentation.1 Replacement refers to the replacement of one term for another term that has a more technical or specific meaning in the discipline. Replacement includes the highlighting of non-specialist/technical terms. Augmentation refers to the expansion of nominal groups and verbal groups in the students’ writing for greater precision. This often includes the addition of classifying information in the nominal group: for example, Piagetian theories.

Examples of marker commentary on the experiential dimension of the student writing are shown below. The tutors’ highlighting of inaccurate terms is represented by underlining in the text excerpt. Additional comments made by the tutors are in bold italic script.

# REPLACEMENT:

– are intertwined to produce child development; to enhance child development – developmentalists; theorists – Distinguish between philosophers (Rousseau and Locke) and psychologists (Skinner, Piaget, Vygotsky)—general ideas vs particular ideas in education

. AUGMENTATION

– some forms of cognitive maturation   
– Piagetian theories   
– according to research statistics, fraternal twins relatedness   
– the child can be moulded by the environment

4.1.1.2 Interpersonal meanings. Analysis of marginal marker comments focussing on the interpersonal function of language suggested four types of intervention. These were categorised as i) modifications of high modality to a lower modality, ii) modifications of strong expressions of thinking and feeling, iii) modifications to the use of the personal pronoun, iv) and highlighting everyday language or informal language.

. MODALITY otherwise a negative environment will be; could be

EXPRESSIONS OF THINKING, FEELING AND ATTITUDE we therefore need to realise; it is therefore essential I would say about $3 5 \%$ disagree completely

PERSONAL PRONOUN we can; avoid personal pronouns

EVERYDAY AND INFORMAL LANGUAGE

– these days more and more people are coming to believe; today much greater credence is attributed to   
– us humans

4.1.1.3 Textual meanings. Analysis of marginal marker commentary attending to textual meanings suggested four concerns: i) paragraph structure ii) cohesive features such as reference and conjunction, and iii) spoken patterns of discourse (e.g. numerous clause complexes, run on sentences, comma splices). Marginal commentary on the intertextual aspect of the disciplinary discourse, that is iv) referencing of sources and the technicalities of referencing, was also included in this category.

# . PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE

# avoid points in an essay—and no one sentence paragraphs

. COHESIVE FEATURES

– contrary to the theories mentioned above; contrary to these theories (grammatical reference) – One example does not prove the rule; conversely (conjunction)

SPOKEN PATTERNS OF DISCOURSE

Watson and Bandura theories are important issues, environment does shape child development but it is only half of the picture hereditary is also of equal importance; Watson’s and Bandura’s theories raise important issues, namely that environment does shape child development. However, heredity is also of equal importance.

INTERTEXTUAL REQUIREMENTS – you must link the quote with the text – Piaget stated; Reference? (lack of references) – Weiten cited in Berk

It should be noted that grammatical realisations of experiential, interpersonal, and textual meanings are not discrete grammatical elements, rather they are ‘‘interwoven in the fabric of the discourse’’ (Halliday & Hasan, 1985: 23). This means that the same word or phrase can contribute to more than one functional meaning. Occurrences of marginal comments relating to experiential features, interpersonal features or textual features of the students’ writing were counted in each essay. The type of commentary for each language function was distinguished and counted according to the identified subcategories. However, as the amount of marker feedback for many subcategories proved to be minimal, a total of the number of comments per essay for experiential features, interpersonal features, and textual features was established to provide a quantitative result. The detailed analytical framework with its subcategories was retained, however, in order to provide a means of classifying and describing the types of socialising commentary the markers made on the students’ assignments. Marker variability was taken into consideration by grouping the essays into tutor groups. This procedure was followed for both essays. The tutors’ summative comments were also analysed in terms of their orientation to experiential, interpersonal and textual meanings. These findings were compared to the marginal commentary findings.

# 4.2. Tutor interviews

Interviews were conducted throughout the longitudinal study with tutors who taught in the subjects in which the students’ assignments were collected. The purpose of the interviews was to determine the types of writing practices the tutors valued, and to examine the tutors’ perceptions of the role of writing for learning. The interviews were informal and structured around focus questions, and were recorded and transcribed. For the purposes of this paper, interview data are only included from the third year interviews with five tutors in which questions of discourse community and writing apprenticeships were directly addressed. Kasia, Mike and Pat, three of the tutors who marked the first year papers, participated in the third year interviews. The additional interviewees, Sally and Penny, had doctoral level qualifications and had taught the targetted core subjects for numerous years.

The focus questions relevant for this study were:

a) What genres2 do you require your students to write?   
b) Do you see any link between the students’ writing now that they are in third year and professional academic writing?   
c) In the literature on students’ development as writers, particularly in regards to postgrads, the process of learning to write is often described as one of apprenticeship. I wonder if you think from your experience and practice if it is an accurate metaphor to describe the process of students’ learning to write?

# 4.3. Student interviews

Interviews with a small number of volunteer students were conducted in the first and third year of the longitudinal study. These students’ texts also formed part of the textual data. In the first year seven students were interviewed, while in the third year it was only possible to interview three of the original seven students, and two of these three interviews had to be conducted via email. For the purposes of this paper, only excerpts from the three third year interviews are included which addressed issues related to discourse community and apprenticeship. One of the three students, Anna, was interviewed in an informal face-to-face interview structured around focus questions, while the other two interviews, Kate and Louise, were conducted via email due to logistical difficulties with meeting on campus. While email correspondence is less spontaneous and open-ended than an informal interview, the email format allowed the interviewees more time to consider their responses. Anna was the highest scoring student in the study, and Kate too had maintained high grades throughout her Education studies. These two students had only recently completed high school. Louise received a High Distinction and

Distinction for her first year assignments, and Credits for her second and third year assignments. Louise was a mature age student and the mother of young twins. The interview questions were as follows:

1. Do you think your writing has developed over the course of the three years? If so, in what ways?   
2. As you progress through your teaching degree there is more emphasis on students engaging with primary research when they write assignments. For example, the journal article review assignment this year required students to read journal articles. Why do you think there has been this emphasis on undergraduate students engaging with primary research?   
3. Do you still find your tutors’ written feedback on your assignments helpful? If so, in what ways?   
4. When you were in first year, I asked you what you thought tutors were looking for in your assignments. Now that you are in third year, do you have a clearer sense of your tutors’ expectations when you write an assignment?

# 5. Results and discussion

# 5.1. Results and discussion of the marker commentary

# 5.1.1. Markers’ marginal comments

For the March 1999 essay, the average number of marginal comments for each tutor per essay for the three functions of language, that is, experiential, interpersonal and textual, is given in Fig. 1. For the June 1999 essay, the average number of comments per tutor for each of the three language functions is given in Fig. 2.

The analytical framework informed by Halliday’s metafunctional model of language provided a means of classifying the types of commentary the four tutors made on the students’ assignments. The results show that the tutors attended to experiential, interpersonal and textual meanings in the students’ writing. In terms of experiential meanings, all four tutors deleted terms used by the students which did not accurately reflect the knowledge building practices of the disciplines. For example the tutors replaced terms such as ‘writings’ with ‘research’ or ‘evidence’. Similarly, the tutors also attempted to help the students’ distinguish between issues, arguments and theories in cases where students had confused these. For example, the nature-nurture theory, was replaced with the nature nurture debate. In the subcategory augmentation, the tendency of marker commentary was to attempt to make the students’ nominal groups more precise by including classifying information. For example, in several instances learning theory was modified to include the classifier social learning theory, while maturation was expanded to include cognitive maturation. This adding of classifying elements to the students writing suggests that the tutors’ comments function to help the students build up a more accurate semiotic map of the discipline.

Fig. 2. Marker feedback on discursive practices of the displine (essay 2).

In terms of interpersonal meanings, the tutors’ commentary adjusted degrees of modality in the students’ writing. In other words, absolute claims were frequently modified to include a degree of hedging. For example, clauses such as ‘this proves the nature theory’, attracted comments such as ‘proves is rather strong’. This type of commentary can be seen to reflect an important socially motivated practice of the mature discourse community. That is, academic writers frequently hedge knowledge claims in order to accommodate conflicting propositions or to allow a degree of uncertainty about research findings (Hyland, 1994). Therese tended to modify students’ explicit expression of feelings or opinions (for example, I think, I believe) so that these were expressed through more impersonal constructions such as it is essential; it seems. Such impersonal expressions of feelings and attitudes are a feature of mature academic discourses, in which arguments and propositions tend to be expressed impersonally. In terms of textual meanings, the tutors’ commentary also attempted to increase the level of intertextuality in the students’ texts by advising on the referencing of sources and technicalities of citation. Intertextuality is a salient feature of mature academic discourses since writers build up knowledge claims by drawing on the explanation of other authors as well as giving authority to knowledge claims by referring to published research. Finally, another socialising dimension of the marker commentary had to do with the logical relations in the students’ texts. As Drury and Gollin (1986) point out, textual features of academic discourse include logical relations between ideas in the text as well as the text’s rhetorical structure. The tutors also made modifying comments on the students’ texts to improve the cohesion between ideas and clarify the logical relations.

The results show that tutors made comments across the three areas of meaning and that many of these comments had a socialising dimension. However, the quantitative results show that the average amount of marker feedback focussing on experiential, interpersonal or textual features of the student writing was relatively small. That is, the largest amount of marginal marker commentary was approximately nine interventions on a 1500 word essay (March, 1999) and eighteen interventions on a 2000 word essay (June, 1999). In the March 1999 essays, Therese made the highest amount of comments per essay. Her comments focussed on experiential features with an average of only 4.1 comments per essay. For the second essay, which was approximately 2000 words in length, Therese again made the highest amount of comments. Again, experiential features attracted the most attention with an average of 8.7 comments per essay.

Therese’s greater attention to experiential features of the student writing for both essays is in contrast to the other three tutors’ greater attention to textual features, particularly intertextual ones, in essay one. This result is slightly different for essay two (Fig. 2), in which experiential features and textual features receive approximately the same amount of attention. For both essays, commentary on interpersonal features such as personal expression of opinion received least attention.

# 5.1.2. Markers’ summarising comments

Summarising comments which functioned to induct students into the disciplinary discourse made by Therese, Kasia, Mike and Pat tended to reiterate the comments the tutors had made throughout the students’ essays. However, Kasia’s summarising comments included a number of comments which acknowledged and allowed language features which would not be considered typical for mature writers in many academic disciplines. Her comments related in particular to interpersonal meanings. For example:

[Kasia] You successfully combine a good academic style in an emotional and artistic way to express your ideas and feelings. . . .Your approach to the task shows a marked degree of originality and insight. (Essay 1, grade awarded, HD)

In the second set of essays, only Pat made a summarising comment which acknowledged a personal style not typically associated with mature academic discourses:

[Pat] Your ideas are passionately argued, . . .I don’t have a problem with the personalisation of your comments but you must refer to evidence to support your ideas. (grade awarded, P)

The presence of these inclusive types of comments focussing on interpersonal meanings shows that in the Education Faculty a personal, subjective style of writing is permissible for undergraduate writers. Furthermore, recurring interpersonal features which are not typical of mature academic discourses, and which were not underlined or crossed out by the tutors, occurred in slightly less than half of the essays in set one (17 essays from 44), and approximately one third in set two (15 essays from 44). In some instances these interpersonal features were positively acknowledged with a tick by the tutor. Interpersonal features are highlighted in the following example:

[Kasia] For example, the theories of Case 1992, Fischer & Farrer 1987, argue that competencies develop with age which extend over time and depend on both biological development and experiences with different types of knowledge and tasks (Berk L, 1997). Personally this is a theory which I really believe in (grade awarded, HD-)

In regards to any correlation between grades awarded and extent of atypical language features in the student writing, no clear pattern was evident in the data summarised in Figs. 1 and 2. However, one tendency which is evident from extensive reading of both sets of essays is that tutors value students’ application of child development theories to the students’ own environments. This is evident in the tutors’ ticking or writing ‘good ’ next to passages in the students’ assignments which linked theory to the students’ lived experiences. Through the applications of child development theories to the students’ teaching situations and their own environments, the students began to engage as practitioners.

Providing marker feedback allows markers to frame the discursive practices of the discipline for novice students. This study of marker feedback on the first year students’ essays echoes Spinks (1998) findings that marker feedback did attempt to socialise students into the discursive practices of the discipline. However, in this study the amount of marker commentary with a socialising dimension was found to be relatively small. The findings show that marker feedback attended more to experiential and textual meanings, focussing on how the specialist knowledge of the discipline was constructed. Interpersonal meanings received least attention, and indeed personal evaluations and applications of theories seemed highly valued.

# 5.2. Results and discussion of the tutor interviews

This section reports on the interviews with the tutors, Mike, Pat, Kasia, Sally and Penny, conducted in the third year of the study. The first question attempted to establish the types of assignments students were required to write and why. An overview of the assignment genres required in the subjects investigated is shown below.

# Genres

Journal article review   
Essay

In response to this question, Mike, Sally and Penny reported that they preferred the essay format with Sally explaining that the essay format required the students to develop an argument. Commenting on inclusion of the research report as an assignment genre in the second year subject, Penny assumed that it had been included in order to encourage students to undertake self-directed learning. Furthermore, she found that the research report was ‘‘a way of moving the theory into practice’’:

[Penny] The research report was also a way of moving theory into practice. A practice which involves reflecting and interpreting, and doing analysis through the theory. I think the report format is a useful tool for researching, reflecting, analysing and interpreting material.

Pat and Kasia focussed their responses on the journal article review required in the third year of the students’ studies. According to these tutors, the purpose of selecting this learning genre was to engage the students in primary research. Students should read primary sources rather than only secondary ones in order to gain some sense of ‘‘where theory comes from’’. With regards to the research report, these two tutors emphasised the need for students to take a critical approach to research findings, to question the credibility of the findings, and to make connections:

[Pat—on why students were asked to write a journal article review] Um for a couple of reasons. One is because most of their training in terms of other subjects they do is dealing with secondary texts rather than primary sources. So that’s one of the reasons. To get them to try and understand where theory comes from. Not all theory is based on research, um, in terms of what they do as researchers, they will be consumers of research. They’ll get directives from the department or from where ever, saying this is the only way to teach. You know, you’ve got to stop doing what you’ve been doing for the last twenty years in reading, and now you have to teach it like this. To me, that kind of thing, if they don’t have an understanding of how research is conducted, and have some kind of critical understanding of the limitations of research, they can be too easily buffeted by the winds of change. So I want them to be able to, to be actually in their teaching practice to be critical consumers of research that comes out. To question how, where this finding came from, how credible it is, and so on. How it compares. So if they support it, or dismiss it, it’s in an informed way, rather than a knee jerk reaction.

The second question was as follows:

Do you see any link between the students’ writing, now that they are in third year, and professional academic writing?

This question drew mixed responses from the tutors. All tutors hesitated and thought carefully before responding with two of the tutors commenting that they had not really thought about this aspect before. Mike responded that he marked with the view that he was training the students to be academic writers. Pat, one of the most senior academics, pointed out that she drew on her own experiences as a writer of academic papers to assist students in coming to terms with academic writing. She made parallels with her own writing in order to point out to the students that the process of writing can aid understanding. Kasia said that she considered the skills or practices she was attempting to develop in the students, such as distinguishing between fact and opinion, were life skills rather than academic skills.

The third question raised the metaphor of apprenticeship:

In the literature on students’ development as writers, particularly in regards to postgrads, the process of learning to write is often described as one of apprenticeship. I wonder if you think from your experience and practice if it is an accurate metaphor to describe the process of students’ learning to write?

This question again drew mostly ambivalent responses. The tutors tended to respond that they did not know because they had not considered how they would describe the process of students’ writing development. Once the metaphor of apprenticeship was introduced into the discussion, several of the tutors explored the implications for their own practice and for the practices of the Faculty. For example:

[Kasia] In my class? I don’t think so. Because we practically don’t write anything together. But I’ve thought about it, and it would be very good. Some of them ask for it. But it is not regarded, I suppose as, . . .but at this stage I don’t feel confident to do it. Some ask ‘‘Do you have an example of a good essay?’’ ‘‘Can I borrow it’’. And I always feel, umm, I’m not sure. I have some examples—I’ve kept them. But it’s so personal and if you give them some model, what would they do? Sometimes you really feel, it’s much harder after you’ve read something because you wouldn’t escape that. You wouldn’t escape the form of logic. But somehow I think it’s a good way, you know, umm, to do some modelling.

The tutors participating in this study were hesitant to draw on the metaphor of apprenticeship to characterise the process of their involvement in the students’ writing development. The tutors’ perception of their engagement with the students’ writing was insufficient to refer metaphorically to the process as a writing apprenticeship. As Kasia explained, ‘‘we practically don’t write anything together’’.

The interview questions aimed to identify contextual influences on the students’ writing; however, the tutors tended to highlight the cognitive dimension of writing in their responses. This can be partly attributed to the tutors’ disciplinary orientation to psychology in their own education and profession. The tutors’ responses tended to emphasise the desired outcomes for the individual student, such as the development through writing of reflective learning and critical analysis.

Another insight from the tutor interviews concerns disciplinary knowledge making practices. Through their choice of assignment genres, the tutors attempted to introduce students to the ways in which theories and knowledge are constructed. Learning to view knowledge as constructed, and how it is constructed, was explained by most of the tutors as being crucial for the students in their teaching practice, in which the students were primarily ‘‘consumers of research’’.

# 5.3. Results and discussion of the student interviews

The first question on students’ perceptions of their writing development drew mixed responses. Kate and Louise commented that their writing had improved and that they had a greater sense of the tutors’ expectations. On the other hand, Anna, the highest scoring student, felt that there had not been any improvement. She felt that she had maintained a standard which she had achieved in first year. Furthermore, she considered her writing to have lost much of its originality, and that her academic writing was not really her own:

[Anna] No, I don’t particularly think my essay writing has developed over the three years. In first year, my tutor made his and basically academics’ expectations extremely clear to me, and I achieved success in those first assignments. Accordingly, I have continued to complete my essays in this fashion, and have continued my achievement of good marks. I don’t believe my vocabulary or sentence structure has developed over the years. If anything, I probably feel that my writing has begun to lose some of the originality and style that I had developed during my high school years, when the emphasis was on personal opinion, substantiated through interpretation of the text (i.e. English). Over the three years, I have become increasingly reliant on academic works to structure and complete my essays, and therefore my essays have lost some of what made them ‘mine’. I mean, I still prefer my high school essays on, for example, Hamlet, to just about any of my essays from uni. They were, in my opinion, easier to read, and carried a greater sense of the person writing them than do my essays from uni. . . .

The responses to the second question on the reasons for undergraduate students engaging with primary research show parallels with several of the tutors’ reasons for requiring students to read primary research. Kate and Louise made links between theory and practice, and considered implications for the classroom. For example:

[Louise] I think they want us to be aware of the diversity of children out there, the theory covers what to do with all types of students but the journal articles actually provide real life examples and solutions of these situations.

Anna, on the other hand, saw the journal article review as a form of induction into the discursive practices of the discourse community, not as a consumer of research but as a participant. Reading primary research was considered by this student as a means of becoming accustomed to the format and the ‘‘lingo’’ of the research article.

[Anna] I think in third year there’s a definite push to encourage us to think of ourselves as researchers and reflective practitioners, and to encourage us to think of doing Honours. I guess by making us use research for our assignments we become accustomed to the format, the lingo, the subject matter. It doesn’t seem out of our reach then.

The next question was concerned with marker feedback. The three students responded that they always took their tutors’ written feedback into account, and that they found it helpful in their writing development. The final question was concerned to probe the students’ understanding of discursive practices in the discipline and their tutors’ expectations. In regard to understanding their tutors’ expectations of student writing, Kate and Louise commented that now they were in third year they had a clearer idea of their tutors’ expectations. Louise elaborated as follows:

[Louise] I think in first year I felt that it was more about what the theory was about, now in third year I know that the lecturers I have had really want you to know the theory but have your own opinion on each theory and they really want you to write about your opinion of the theory.

Kate commented that she thought that tutors were looking for well thought out arguments and careful proofreading. These students also stated that they felt there had not been a change in their tutors’ expectations as ‘‘tutors have always expected a high quality of writing’’ [Louise]. Anna, on the other hand, reiterated a comment she had made in the first year interview, stating that she did not have a very clear idea of the tutors’ expectations. In her response she also revisited her earlier comment on the restrictive nature of academic writing. These aspects of her comments are in italics:

[Anna] No, I can’t say that I do. Now we’re in third year, more of the assignments are framed in much looser terms. In first year, they had a sense of being prescribed, and there was always a chance to clarify, and support was offered to all students within the context of the class. As we’ve got older, that support has been reduced, as it should be. However, with that reduction in support has come a reduction in the structure of the questions, but this has not created a greater sense of freedom or self-expression in the assignments. I still feel under the constraint of having to back up everything said with the opinion of an academic, and now have to seek further afield to do this.

A feature of the students’ responses to this question on tutor expectations was uncertainty. While the participants were aware of the distinctive nature of academic writing, they were unable to confidently describe what they considered their tutors valued. This finding has important implications for tutor and faculty initiatives aiming to make explicit to students the expected and valued discursive writing practices of their disciplines. Despite the Education Faculty’s and the tutors’ attempts in this study, the valued writing practices of the discipline remained for the participants intangible for hazy concepts.

One reason for this situation may be due to the students’ incomplete understandings and misconceptions about two influential factors: the multi-layered context in which they were writing, and ways in which disciplinary knowledge is constructed. There also seemed to be a sense of frustration about disciplinary knowledge building practices: for example, Anna’s comment: ‘‘I still feel under the constraint of having to back up everything said with the opinion of an academic’’. Disciplinary knowledge building practices and the contexts in which students are writing seem important starting points from which tutors and faculty writing guidelines can begin to explore with students the reasons for and purpose of some of the discursive practices which are expected of students.

Anna’s comment on the restrictive nature of academic writing echoes the findings of Lillis (1997) and Cadman (1997), who found that their non-English speaking background students experienced academic writing as constrictive, and raised questions of identity for the students. While Anna did not frame her response to academic writing as a member of a marginalised group (for example, as a migrant, as an indigenous student), she articulated a loss of what Ivanicˇ (1998) refers to as her ‘discoursal identity’. Again, one way to address the student’s concerns is to provide a disciplinary context for the student’s writing, and to consider the knowledge building practices of the discipline. This is not to discount the student’s experience of academic writing as restrictive and resulting in a reduction in her creativity; however, it provides one means of both understanding such practices as well as exploring alternatives.

# 6. Conclusion and implications

This exploration into the relation of student writing to the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship provides discipline specific findings as well as general insights for EAP practitioners. In terms of discipline specific findings, the results from the three sets of data suggest that in the context of this study there appears to be a strong division between the consumers and producers of disciplinary knowledge. From the tutors’ perspective it appears inaccurate to describe the pre-service teachers as novice members of the disciplinary community. Instead, consumers of disciplinary knowledge may be a more accurate description. Similarly, none of the tutors considered the metaphor of apprenticeship as a suitable one to characterise the process of students’ learning the discursive practices of the discipline. The results from the marker commentary study suggest that marker commentary only appeared to play a small role in socialising the trainee teachers to the discursive practices of the discipline.

These results could suggest that in response to one of the questions posed at the beginning of this paper, the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship are not particularly relevant when considering the writing of undergraduate Education students. The results from the student interviews, however, reveal disjunctions between the tutor and student perspectives about the contextual influences on students’ writing. The students’ sense of the discursive practices as restrictive and prescriptive is in contrast to the findings from the marker commentary. One explanation for this discrepancy may be due to the nature of the research design for this dimension of the study. That is, the student interview data was qualitative in nature, while the marker commentary results took into account the amount and distribution of commentary. From the students’ perspective, any tutor commentary on their writing style and language choices could well be interpreted as prescriptive. Rather than negotiating and explaining the context that shapes the writing practices, students are commanded, obliged, criticised for their stylistic choices, and so on. For example (examples are from the marker feedback):

# Imperative/Command

theorists have proven (? too general! Identify!) avoid personal pronouns

Style

However, sometimes your interpretation and presentation of Piaget and Vygotsky’s ideas obviously suffer from an oversimplification and distortion for the sake of belletristic style

What is absent from these comments is an explanation of why the requirements are valued. Without an understanding of the disciplinary context and the way it shapes disciplinary knowledge, comments such as ‘‘your style should be more academic’’ are likely to have little meaning for the student, other than a set of rules to which need to be adhered. The student interviews also suggest that the students do not seem to have any tangible sense of the disciplinary context as a dynamic social environment, in which negotiating meanings is an intrinsic discursive practice and that disciplinary knowledge is contested and contestable knowledge.

It is in these areas that the concept of discourse community is relevant for the Education students. Providing a contextual framework would assist the tutors in explaining the discursive practices of the discipline, rather than merely prescribing them. It may also help students to identify areas in which they can position themselves more confidently as participants within that context, and through this process to experience the discourse as less restrictive. While marker feedback is only one aspect of students’ socialisation and learning in a disciplinary context, it could prove a most tangible area from which tutors can explore with their students the relation between language choices, the disciplinary context and learning.

The broader implications of this study are two-sided. From one perspective, the relatively ‘negative’ findings about the participant perspectives of discourse community and apprenticeship suggest that these concepts need to be viewed critically by tertiary literacy practitioners and EAP teachers, particularly in vocationally oriented disciplines. Practitioners who uncritically adopt the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship risk making connections and generalisations about student writing that may be inaccurate and misleading in specific disciplinary contexts. Another perspective, however, is that the concepts of discourse community and apprenticeship provide a rich contextual framework for researching the social practices that shape students’ writing in disciplinary contexts. By investigating participant perspectives as well as practices such as the type of marker feedback tutors provide, tertiary literacy teachers can assist participants to gain a better understanding of the complex practices and influences that exist between student writers and their disciplinary discourse community. This paper has also contributed a detailed methodological framework for investigating the ways in which marker commentary can socialise students to the discursive practices of the discipline.
