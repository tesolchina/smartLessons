# ABSTRACT

In this study, the use of a popular mobile social networking platform (WeChat) is investigated for learning Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) in a beginners’ course at an Australian university. Driven by practical considerations and major issues with previous literature, student engagement and authentic language used in a WeChat class group are investigated. Data was collected through weekly conversation episodes over a semester and from a student survey. Conversation episodes were analysed both quantitatively (by frequencies) and qualitatively (using a discourse approach). The study found that student engagement increased in frequency and complexity towards the end of the semester, and students used Chinese for various authentic purposes in the semi-formal context of class group chats. A microanalysis of transcripts illustrated how the use of Chinese in multilingual and multimodal practices achieved authentic social functions. However, individual differences were observed, and English was frequently used in chats. Recommendations are provided for scaffolding and for utilising different semiotic resources in dynamic group interactions.

# 1.  Introduction

With their media richness and communication facilities, mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) environments can facilitate frequent and meaningful interactions, providing more authentic and engaging learning experiences for students (Kukulska-Hulme, 2009). In particular, interactive social networking services (SNSs) on mobile devices can provide students with access to information according to their interests, enabling them to participate in meaningful conversations (Peng, 2020). Despite the advantages of MALL and SNS environments, researchers have reported practical challenges regarding student engagement and resistance to technology (e.g. Reinhardt, 2019).

In this case study, the use of a popular mobile social networking platform (WeChat) is investigated for learning Chinese. As a teacher– researcher community of practice, we employed WeChat in a beginning-level Chinese course. Learner engagement and authentic language use were two major issues that arose from our teaching practice. When the study reported in this paper was conducted in 2017, WeChat was mainly used outside of the classroom for class administration and casual chatting. We noticed that authentic CFL learning emerged when WeChat groups were used as a social tool. In 2018, with the hope of maximizing the affordances of WeChat for language teaching, the teaching team designed WeChat tasks, which were formally incorporated into the curriculum (see the task design in Tong, An, & Zhou, 2020). Although these tasks facilitated student language practice and wider engagement in WeChat functions, a sharp decline was observed in the number of casual posts made by students in the WeChat groups—they began using it only as an assignment submission platform. We will discuss the (non)participatory and (in)authentic features of formally integrated WeChat activities elsewhere. This article focuses on the dynamics of learner engagement and language practices in casual group chats, since such investigation can offer insights into how active engagement and authentic language use can be promoted by using WeChat for informal learning.

How and to what extent mobile SNSs should be incorporated into curricula is an issue of concern. As argued by Reinhardt (2019), resistance to SNSs can depend on task and learner variables, such as whether activities are imposed top-down. This suggests that future research should build on findings from naturalistic and informal L2 use and learning, which are scarce in the existing literature. Peng (2020) also found that student self-reporting behaviour on WeChat did not accurately reflect their actual, less engaged behaviour in chat records. Accordingly, student perceptions (survey or interview data) alone are not reliable data sources.

To address these issues, we examined naturally occurring conversations over a semester in an out-of-class WeChat group for a beginner’s Chinese course at an Australian university. Results from a student survey were also used to triangulate findings. The overall goal was to identify the features of student engagement and possibilities for authentic language use and to inform MALL pedagogy. Thus, the following questions are addressed:

1. How frequently did students engage in group chats? What was the developing pattern over the semester?   
2. What contributed to authentic language use in the group chats?   
3. How can active engagement and authentic language use on WeChat be encouraged?

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  The affordances of WeChat for Chinese language learning (CLL)

The affordance of an environment was defined by Gibson (1979) as ‘what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill’ (p. 127). Based on Gibson, subsequent scholars conceptualised affordance as ‘the perceived and actual […] fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used’ (Norman, 1988, p. 9), or opportunities for actions (Sanders, 1997). In this sense, the affordances of WeChat for CLL refer to the essential features of the platform that could possibly be used for language learning. Jin (2018) identified four affordances of WeChat for language learning during study abroad (SA): a casual space with easy access to native speakers (NSs) of Chinese, authentic meaning-focused communication with NSs, linguistic resources and multiliteracies, and space for new identity creation. Other studies have also reported the perceived benefits of WeChat in facilitating language acquisition, confidence, motivation, cultural learning, and community building in a variety of learning activities (Chen & Zhan, 2020; Jiang & Li, 2018; Luo & Yang, 2016; Sung & Poole, 2017; Wang, Fang, Han, & Chen, 2016; Xu & Peng, 2017).

Limitations of using WeChat for language learning have also been identified. Sung and Poole (2017) indicated that a lack of Chinese proficiency was the main obstacle to communication on WeChat with NSs. Tong and Tsung (2018) revealed two further limitations in SA contexts: the tendency to use English in chats and a lack of continuity in using WeChat after the SA program. Huang (2019) found that WeChat failed to foster autonomous learning in a moment posting task, and student participation and motivation declined over time.

Although some previous studies have adopted transcript analysis of WeChat conversations, this study has a distinct focus and scope: first, it focuses on the learning experience of beginning-level learners whose linguistic resources are lacking; second, it examines teacher–learner and learner–learner interactions in naturally occurring conversations. In previous studies, WeChat records were analysed by Wang et  al. (2016), although their Chinese learners were third-year students with richer linguistic resources compared to the beginners in our study. Jin (2018)

examined a beginner’s semiotic use on WeChat. However, her study was in a SA context in which the learner had more chances to befriend NSs and chat for authentic purposes. In Xu and Peng (2017), transcripts were used to analyse feedback types and linguistic targets, while WeChat was adopted for a formal oral task.

How beginning-level learners appropriate the affordances of WeChat and use their limited semiotic resources in naturally occurring conversations in class group chats has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the findings of this study can contribute to a fuller picture of WeChat utilisation for interaction and language use.

# 2.2.  Student engagement in L2 learning on social media

The literature above has suggested that although WeChat affords many opportunities for language learning, active engagement from students is not guaranteed (e.g. Huang, 2019; Tong & Tsung, 2018). Further, in the broader field of social media-enhanced L2 learning (Lamy & Zourou, 2013), self-directed learning and learner autonomy are also prominent issues in both formal and informal settings (Reinhardt, 2019).

On the one hand, students may feel reluctant to use social networking tool for formal learning. Lin, Groom, and Lin (2013) examined why many students did not engage in blogging more than required by a formal curriculum or continue blogging after instruction. Although their participants acknowledged the novel and convenient nature of blogging for L2 learning, they were more focused on the assigned, formal nature of the tasks rather than their blog-enhanced quality. Liaw and English’s (2018) comparative study provides further evidence that less interpersonal and textual language was found in formal, institution-supported SNSs compared to unofficial Facebook groups created by the learners, due to the latter’s uncritical quality. Lai, Hu, and Lyu’s (2018) survey uncovered that some learners found social media for extramural learning forced and inauthentic. Hence, participation should be advocated in interest-focused affinity spaces where L2 is the means rather than the goal of interaction.

On the other hand, a lack of monitoring and scaffolding can also cause low engagement (Huang, 2019; Kennedy & Miceli, 2013). Therefore, Reinhardt (2019) suggested that careful scaffolding of SNS resources is necessary for facilitating learners’ gradual claim of ownership, thus increasing their autonomy. Supporting evidence can be found in Yang, Crook, and O’Malley (2014), where the teacher gradually relinquished activity direction to the students, who then autonomously developed regulatory skills for their learning and that of others through the inquiry process. Yang et  al.’s study suggested the need for an input from the teacher to facilitate deeper levels of engagement on SNS and posited that the teacher needs to learn about the students’ interests and potential attitudes and help them identify how their informal experiences could be relevant to learning.

These studies indicate that student engagement in L2 learning on SNSs depends on a balance between maintaining the informal and voluntary nature of activities and providing careful scaffolding and monitoring. The type of activity investigated in this study (informal chats in a WeChat class group set by the language teacher) is a typical ‘semi-formal’ (Reinhardt, 2019, p. 25) context, where learners participate voluntarily with the teacher available for scaffolding. The findings inform WeChat-supported instruction in similar contexts and contribute to the literature on SNS-enhanced L2 learning.

# 2.3.  Authentic language learning in MALL

Some studies have acknowledged the benefits of WeChat for authentic language learning. In Jin’s (2018) study, novice and advanced learners were able to engage in authentic conversations with NSs. While authentic communication for novices meant discussing topics that were relevant, it facilitated real-life solutions (e.g. arranging meeting places and times) for advanced learners. Students in Sung and Poole (2017) study also perceived learning on WeChat as authentic, since they could participate in conversations that ‘meant something’ (p. 108) and errors were only corrected when communication was impeded. In Tong, An, and Zhou (2020), tasks were considered authentic if they were meaningful and relevant to students’ lives and interests. In summation, authentic contexts have one or more of the following features:

Involving Chinese NSs;   
Prioritising meaningful communication over linguistic accuracy;   
Being relevant to real-life contexts or linguistic resources;   
Facilitating real-life problem-solving;   
Having meaning or relevance to the learner.

However, the reviewed studies were not based on a clear definition of authenticity.

In learning science, authenticity ‘lies in the learner-perceived relations between the practices they [the learners] are carrying out and the use value of these practices’ (Barab, Squire, & Dueber, 2000, p. 38). Kearney, Schuck, Burden, and Aubusson’s (2012) pedagogical framework of mobile learning suggests that authenticity comprises two dimensions: contextualisation (realistic/relevant to the learner) and situatedness (participatory/ embedded in a real community of practice). In other words, authentic learning tasks have real-world relevance and personal meaning for the learners (Radinsky, Bouillion, Lento, & Gomez, 2001).

In the MALL literature, Shadiev, Hwang, and Huang (2017) defined a ‘familiar authentic environment’ as ‘familiar and relevant with predictable situations from students’ background and previous experiences’ (p. 285). In such environments, students can apply knowledge to solve real-life problems they encounter many times in familiar and natural contexts (Golonka, Bowles, Frank, Richardson, & Freynik, 2014). Conversely, unfamiliar or infrequently visited learning environments (e.g. local zoos or historical sites) may not provide equally authentic learning opportunities (Shadiev et  al., 2017). ‘Real authentic learning environments’ (ibid., p.296) enable students to select and generate content that is meaningful. Further, learning activities supported by mobile technologies can create familiar authentic environments with rich resources, supported by multimedia tools (Huang, Shadiev, Sun, Hwang, & Liu, 2016).

Informed by these definitions of authenticity, we examine how learners use linguistic and semiotic resources to achieve authentic communicative goals and what affordances of WeChat contribute to these opportunities.

# 3.  Methodology

# 3.1.  Case study method

This research adopted a case study approach, which is useful if the research aims to illuminate a particular situation and establish an in-depth understanding of it (Yin, 2006). The case study method is in line with the purposes of this research, allowing us to make direct observations and collect data in natural settings (Flyvbjerg, 2010).

Although the case study approach has obtained a routinely accepted status as a viable research method, there are some misunderstandings about its generalisability and validity (Flyvbjerg, 2010). However, as Flyvbjerg (2010) argued, a single-case study, though without any attempt to generalise, can certainly be of value in the collective process of knowledge accumulation and it often helps open a path to innovation or theory building (ibid.). While quantitative researchers consider the generalisability of statistical results, qualitative case study researchers are more concerned with the applicability of the findings. The latter may be enhanced through a dense description of the case, sampling strategies and arousing the readers’ interests in, or awareness of, the major issues involved in a case, which may inspire the adoption of the practices in other situations (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2010). Other people may conjecture that the case study method fosters a bias towards expected outcomes. In fact, a case study does not confirm researchers’ preconceptions but sharpens their understanding of things, sometimes even bringing about contradictory interpretations and falsifications (e.g. Ragin, 1992). Following these opinions, the present case study does not aim to predict the use of WeChat in other situations but to identify its potentials, affordances and possibilities, thus adding to the collective efforts on MALL research.

Nevertheless, the criticisms of case studies sensitised us to the methodological limitations of this research. First, the results of the research are highly context dependent, and the findings should be interpreted with much caution. The case reported in this study was selected through opportunistic sampling since it was the one accessible to the researchers. The informants were self-selected because they consented to share their data. However, the likely richness of the available data and the preliminary evidence in the case are also the key criteria for case selection (Yin, 2006). Second, even though this case study can provide more nuanced and in-depth details than the quantitative method, we acknowledge that the latter approach can address some questions that this study is not capable of answering (e.g. identifying statistically significant variables and between-group differences). Finally, while case studies traditionally focus on single cases (Abbott, 1992; Yin, 2009), some scholars believe that multiple cases may strengthen the findings (Yin, 2006; 2009) and improve the applicability of the research (Gall et  al., 2010). We invite well-designed multi-case studies to further our insights into the diverse possibilities of student engagement and authentic language use on WeChat.

While recognising the limitations above, we tried to add rigour to this research through the following strategies, inspired by the methodology literature (Gall et  al., 2010) and previous single-case studies (e.g. Leikin & Rota, 2006; Reinhardt & Chen, 2013). First, data were collected from different sources for triangulation. Second, quantitative/ numeric data were incorporated to facilitate the description and qualitative interpretation of the case. Third, long-term observations were conducted. Fourth, the usefulness and applicability of the findings were demonstrated. As will be explained in more detail below, this research collected data through both WeChat records and a student survey. The WeChat record collection spanned the beginning to the end of one semester. Both numerical and qualitative analyses of the WeChat transcripts were conducted. Finally, we will present implications on how the findings could be applied to other contexts in the Discussion section.

# 3.2.  Research context

The study was conducted in 2017 in a CFL course at a university in Sydney, Australia. The unit schedule consisted of a lecture on Monday $( \mathrm { 1 h } )$ and tutorials on Tuesday (1 h) and Thursday $( 2 \mathrm { h } )$ . The lecture was delivered to the whole student cohort, while the students were divided into five class groups for the tutorials (taught by different tutors). The lecturer and tutors were all (NSs) of Chinese and experienced WeChat users.

The primary goal of using WeChat was to support instant interaction between the teacher and the students in informal settings. Since weekly face-to-face contact was inadequate for language exposure, methods of promoting out-of-class learning were desirable. WeChat groups were established by the tutors for their tutorial groups. Moreover, no formal activities or assessments were designed, meaning student engagement was voluntary and emerged from their own interest. As mentioned in Introduction, formal WeChat assignments were designed in the following year, which created an essentially distinct ecology for student engagement and language use. However, thorough comparisons are beyond the scope of this article.

# 3.3.  Participants and data collection

The participants were beginning-level Chinese learners who had little (or no) Chinese learning experience prior to the course. The demographic data collected through an end-of-semester survey (Appendix A) voluntarily responded to by 81 students $7 4 \%$ of the whole cohort) showed that the students’ ages ranged from 20 to 24 years $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 2 0 . 2 ,$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 7 0 3 )$ ). There were more females $\mathrm { \Delta } \cdot \mathrm { n } = 4 9$ , $6 0 . 5 \%$ ) than males $( \mathtt { n } = 4 2$ , $3 9 . 5 \% )$ ). Most students spoke English as their first language (L1) $( \mathtt { n } = 5 4$ , $6 6 . 7 \% )$ . Other L1s spoken by more than one student were Korean $[ \mathtt { n } = 1 0$ , $1 2 . 3 \% )$ , Cantonese $\left( \mathrm { n } = 7 , 8 . 6 \% \right)$ and Japanese $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 , \ 3 . 7 \% \right)$ .1 The survey indicated that $4 3 . 2 \%$ participants had used WeChat before. WeChat functions were introduced in class to ensure the students could use the application. Since many functions (e.g. friending, chats, and posts) share similarities with other SNSs, few technical difficulties were encountered. However, instruction was provided on changing aliases in group chats and typing Chinese characters and Pinyin using mobile keyboards.

Two sets of data were collected: WeChat history of the first author’s class group (22 students) and the end-of-semester student survey (Appendix A). The survey was administered to the whole cohort (110 students), comprising five groups taught by different tutors (including the first author’s), and was completed by 81 students $( 7 4 \% )$ . We acknowledge that a limitation of this study was the unavailability of WeChat history data from the other tutorial groups due to a lack of formal consent from some teachers and students. Further, since the questionnaires were anonymous, we could not identify the first author’s students and match between their WeChat history and survey responses. However, since the students in all five classes shared similar learning environments on WeChat, the survey results present a general picture of student perceptions. Ideally, between-group differences should be considered since teacher attitudes can influence technology-mediated L2 learning (e.g. Lee & Wang, 2013). However, our survey did not include teacher or group information to protect teacher privacy.

The weighting of methods is considered, as a mixed-method approach was adopted (Padgett, 2008). Since our focus was on naturally occurring data, survey results were used to supplement the findings from WeChat history. Ethics approval was granted by the Ethics Committee at the institution where the research was conducted, and consent was obtained from the participants.

# 3.4.  Analysis of WeChat history data

The WeChat history was examined diachronically over a semester, and the group was created in week 4. The semester comprised 13 study weeks and a week for the mid-term break, meaning chats were recorded over 11 weeks.

The basic units for examination were conversation episodes, defined as ‘discursive events or action sequences, each delimited from prior and subsequent discourse and internally bound together by a coherent topical trajectory and/or a common activity’ (Korolija & Linell, 1996, p. 800). Episodes are ‘suitable units of analysis for (especially) multiparty conversations because episodes are, in general, natural units of social interaction […] held together by a common floor and focus of attention’ (Korolija & Linell, 1996, p. 800). We segmented the WeChat history into episodes by identifying conversations that initiated a new topic (see an example in Appendix B).

Altogether, 61 episodes emerged from WeChat groups, which were analysed quantitatively (for frequency) and qualitatively using a discourse approach.

# 3.4.1.  Quantitative analysis of WeChat history

Frequencies were calculated to measure student engagement and language practices in weekly chats and to identify developing patterns over time, including the following:

1. The overall number of conversation episodes each week;   
2. The number of students involved in WeChat conversations;   
3. The number of episodes initiated by the teacher/students each week;   
4. The number of episodes for different purposes (class management, language learning, casual, see clarification below) each week;   
5. The number of episodes that involved different modes of Chinese (Chinese characters, Pinyin, stickers/pictures with captions, and voice messages) each week.

The categorisations of different purposes were informed by the commonly identified affordances of WeChat in the literature and our teaching practices. The educational affordances of WeChat mentioned in the literature review can be categorised as follows: direct learning purposes (authentic learning, evaluation, and feedback), related to metacognition (administration for learning and resource sharing), and socio-affective processes (collaboration, community building, and motivating environment) (Xue & Churchill, 2019). Further, Lyu and Lai (2019) found that the affordance of SNS-enhanced L2 learning comprised the dimensions of cognition (acquiring language knowledge), metacognition and organization (monitoring learning processes and seeking learning resources), and socio-affect (connecting with others in the community).

Based on these considerations, three broad types of purposes for chatting were examined. Class management occurred when the teacher made announcements or when students asked questions about housekeeping issues. Language learning episodes contained an explicit focus on learning, such as discussing a language point or requesting feedback from the teacher. Casual chatting occurred for socialising, irrelevant to either the practical affairs of class management or explicit language learning.

# 3.4.2.  Qualitative analysis of WeChat history

Numerical data was supplemented by the qualitative analysis of conversation episodes, which revealed more details about actual language practices. The microanalysis of WeChat conversations was guided by a computer-mediated discourse (CMD) analytic approach (Herring, 2001; Herring & Androutsopoulos, 2015; Vandergriff, 2016), which is a method used to analyse typography, orthography, and word-formation processes in computer-mediated communication (Herring & Androutsopoulos, 2015). The goal is to understand ‘the interplay of technological, social, and contextual factors in the shaping of computer-mediated practices’ (Androutsopoulos, 2006, p. 420–421). CMD analysis can be conducted at various levels2 , with the most relevant to this study being multilingual and multimodal practice, because they can help uncover how learners exercise agency in language use.

Multilingual practice refers to how socially conditioned variation of language use in computer-mediated environments reflects the influence of medium and situation factors on linguistic choices (Herring, 2001; Herring & Androutsopoulos, 2015). Multilingual resources were deployed strategically and can be motivated by a range of contextual factors. Therefore, transcript analysis focused on circumstances where learners switched to Chinese. Vandergriff (2016) summarised several functions of code-switching, including ideational function (to facilitate the conveyance of information), stylistic function (to signal transitions between activity types or different foci), interpersonal function (typically to switch to L1 to express emotion), and indexing multilingual identity. Whether (and how) these functions were achieved to facilitate language use in authentic contexts and the associated performance of identities is evaluated.

Multimodal practice involves channels of communication other than (or in addition to) plain text. Although analysing multimodal CMD can overlap with other levels of analysis, multimodality raises additional considerations, deserving a separate discussion (Herring & Androutsopoulos, 2015). Herein, the focus is on the use of Chinese language in different modalities (e.g. typed characters/Pinyin and stickers/pictures with Chinese captions). This excludes pictures without Chinese captions and pure emojis, although our transcript analysis also considers emojis used with text as social cues. The WeChat history was transcribed to improve the presentation of translations (see transcription conventions in Appendix C).

# 3.5.  Analysis of student survey data

The survey comprised two multiple choice and five open-ended questions. Since this was the first time that WeChat had been employed in the course, open-ended questions elicited all possible answers from students. The two multiple choice questions determined students’ frequency and the perceived usefulness of using WeChat for Chinese learning during the course. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and Pearson correlation was conducted to explore relationships. The results helped us examine students’ self-report engagement in WeChat usage and perceived benefits.

The open-ended questions further explored student behaviour and language use, their perceptions and suggestions. The answers were categorised into themes that were ranked on frequency of occurrence, allowing salient themes to emerge. In the findings section, relevant survey results are accessed to complement the analysis of WeChat history. Referenced results are presented in Appendix D to avoid repetition.

# 4.  Data analysis

# 4.1.  Student engagement in WeChat for CLL

4.1.1.  The overall number of weekly conversation episodes As mentioned previously, the basic unit examined in the group chat history was a ‘conversation episode’, which excluded teacher posts that received no response from students. The percentage of such posts decreased tremendously after the first few weeks (Figure 1), indicating that students became increasingly responsive in the group chats.

The number of conversation episodes increased weekly (Figure 2), suggesting that the group became more active over time. The reduced participation in Weeks 9 and 12 could be explained by the reduced amount of attention students gave to their Chinese studies due to their mid-term vacation in Week 9 and the overwhelming number of final assignments in other courses towards the end of the semester in Week 12. Since the final two weeks were the revision and exam weeks for the Chinese course, participation increased again in Week 13.

# 4.1.2.  The number of students involved in conversations

Overall, there was an upward trend over the semester regarding the number of students involved each week (Figure 3).

Some students were more active than others. Seventeen of the 22 students participated at least once during the semester, while five did not engage at all. Table 1 summarises the number of episodes in which each student participated throughout the semester. Students with Asian backgrounds appeared to be more active, perhaps due to their higher confidence in the language; however, there were some exceptions (see S2 and S11 in Table 1). Notably, students with a Cantonese background were all at a beginner level of Mandarin Chinese based on the pre-course language evaluation; thus, their background did not guarantee that they would be more proficient in Mandarin. However, their frequent engagement should be interpreted with caution, as they might have had more access to Mandarin linguistic resources than other students. Future studies could examine in more detail how the presence of Cantonese students in a Chinese language class influences other students’ engagement by interviewing students to determine their perceptions.

The survey results parallel the WeChat history. The students were asked to rate their frequency of using WeChat for language learning on a scale ranging from 1 (very frequently) to 5 (never). The mean was 2.52 $\mathrm { ( S D = } \mathrm { . } 7 4 4 \mathrm { ) }$ ), indicating a level between ‘frequently’ and ‘sometimes’, with $4 9 . 4 \%$ of students choosing ‘very frequently’ or ‘frequently’ and $4 3 . 2 \%$ stating ‘sometimes’ (Table D1, Appendix D). The Pearson’s correlation between frequency of use and perceived usefulness indicate that the positive relationship was significant $\mathbf { \Phi } ( \mathbf { r } = . 5 9 5 $ , $\mathrm { ~ p ~ } < \ . 0 0 1 $ ), suggesting that students who used WeChat frequently found it more useful. However, limited by the small sample and survey design, the survey results cannot validate the statistical relationship between cultural background and WeChat usage to confirm the observation elicited from Table 1.

As will be discussed later, although active students contributed significantly to authentic language use in the group, lack of participation was perceived as a limitation by the students.

# 4.1.4.  Limitations of student engagement on WeChat for CLL

Despite the increasing trend of student engagement frequency, the number of students who actively participated was low (Table 1). Although $5 0 \%$ reported frequent use of WeChat for language learning, $5 0 \%$ used it infrequently (Table D1, Appendix D).

The survey results also reveal that the top category of perceived limitations was ‘inactive student participation’ $( \mathtt { n } = 9 )$ (Figure D2, Appendix D), with a typical response of ‘Only people who usually talk[ed] usually chat[ted], but some members [did] not read from the first to the last [of the semester].’ Some students (Figure D3, Appendix  D) hoped to have more activities on WeChat, use it more often, or even use it for homework.

# 4.2.  Authentic use of Chinese on WeChat

Some responses (Figure D1, Appendix D supported the authentic learning environment on WeChat from the learner perspective, a representative response being ‘WeChat group was a casual learning environment that reflects real-life use of the language’. This section focuses on how learners used Chinese in authentic contexts.

# 4.2.1.  Chinese language use for different types of authentic purposes

All 61 episodes involved some Chinese language use, while the conversation episodes had three main purposes: class management, language learning (inquiring and discussing L2 related knowledge), and casual chats (see Section 3.3.1 for clarification). The weekly trend of these episodes is depicted in the stacked-area chart in Figure 5.

Episodes for class management were the most frequent, while the other two increased towards the end of the semester. Although the WeChat group was initially created for class management, some students gradually utilised it for language learning, and a few started to feel comfortable chatting casually as the semester progressed.

In these episodes, Chinese was used to achieve real-life communicative goals, for making arrangements, discussing language knowledge, or leisure. The process of making inquiries can be perceived as emergent opportunities for language use for problem solving. Although asking questions in Chinese was not compulsory in group chats, many students voluntarily applied what had been learned in the course. In some cases, students only used simple Chinese expressions, such as ‘Teacher, may I ask’, ‘is it’, ‘how to say’, or ‘okay, thanks’ in conjunction with English, while other students proactively experimented with using what was learned in class or beyond.

Figure 5. N umber of episodes for different purposes (WK $=$ week).

Although casual chats were relatively few, they helped construct a welcoming environment for self-expression. Chinese was used to refer to real-life objects, people, and events, or to express personal emotions. Casual chats became more intensive towards the end of the semester as group participation became increasingly active and dynamic. The next sub-section presents a more detailed analysis of how multiple linguistic resources were used for authentic communication.

# 4.2.2.  Chinese language use in multilingual practices

The examples in this section demonstrate that learners switched to Chinese by applying and adapting textbook resources to local contexts or by using resources beyond textbooks.

First, in some cases, students accurately applied linguistic structures in the textbook to local contexts, which can solve real-life problems. Episode 48 provides an example (see the transcription conventions in Appendix C).3

Conversation Episode 48

1 S3: 同学们\~ Oral现在在office还是classroom [Classmates \~ Oral is now at the   
office or in the classroom]   
2 S3:?   
3 S5: Classroom   
4 S5: 从两点在office [at the office since 2 o’clock]   
5S3: $\varpi { \sf S 5 }$ 好.谢谢你…!! [Okay. Thank you…!!]   
6 S5: {Thumb up sticker}   
7 S5: $\textcircled { a } { \mathrm { S } } 3$ 不用谢 [You are welcome]

The structures ‘现在(now)’, ‘在(at)’ and ‘还是(or)’ in Line 1 and ‘从(since/ from)’ in Line 4 were language points in previous lessons, which were perfectly applied to solve a real-life problem related to class management. Peer assistance indicated that students adopted the identity of a legitimate Chinese user who could monitor their learning process in that language.

Second, not all resources in the textbook can be readily employed in an authentic context, and Chinese use should be promoted by recasting (customising to the learner’s level) and code-switching. Episode 42 illustrates the dynamics in authentic language use.

Conversation Episode 42

1 S6: 老师, 我今天不上课, 因为我病了。[Teacher, I today don’t have class, because I’m sick.] I heard we had a sheet that put down the times for oral that we want?

2 S6: Would you mind telling me what time slot I have for the oral please? 谢 谢你 [Thank you.] {smiling emoji} {smiling emoji}

3 Teacher: 是啊！你今天没上课, 所以没有写你的名字. [Yeah! You didn’t come for class today, so your name was not written (you were not signed up for the exam time slot).] Unfortunately, the time slots from $1 2 \mathrm { - } 2 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . are all booked, 你从下午两点到两点半有时间吗？[Are you available from 2:00 to $2 { : } 3 0 \ \mathrm { p . m . ? } ]$

4 Teacher: Are you available from 2 to $2 { : } 3 0 \ \mathrm { p } . \mathrm { m } . ?$

5 S6: 我有时间。[I have time.] Do I come to your office for the oral, or do I just do it in the class?

6 Teacher: 太好了！请来我的office, [Great! Please come to my office,] […]

7 S6: 谢谢 老师 [Thank you teacher]

8 Teacher: 不客气！[You are welcome]

9 Teacher: {Sticker with a caption 不客气}

10 Teacher: 祝你早日康复！[Hope you get well soon!] Hope you get well soon!

11 S6: So do I:)

12 S6: 谢谢 [Thanks]

The exchanges demonstrate real-life use of language relating to a learned topic (making an appointment). Notably, this was not ‘rehearsal’ or simulation; it was language use to achieve a real-life goal. In Line 1, the student used an incorrect expression ‘不上课 (don’t have class)’. Since this did not impede understanding, the teacher did not correct the mistake explicitly and recast it using the correct expression ‘没上 课 (did not have class)’. The teacher’s sentence in Line 3 was deliberately customised to the students’ proficiency level. Instead of using ‘报名’ (a standard, more advanced translation of ‘signing up’), ‘写你的名字 (write your name)’ was used, which had already been learned. As the main interlocutor, the teacher played a role in cultivating a group culture that embraced Chinese language use for authentic purposes. Language not learned was also deployed, as in Line 10. The teacher took the opportunity to demonstrate a formulaic expression used when someone is sick, in conjunction with its English translation. The students’ authentic social identity (a sick person needing to take a leave) was enacted.

Third, to achieve authentic purposes, students may seek external help and use language far beyond the textbook, which might not be comprehensible to other students. Here, maintaining the passion of these students while not intimidating others is important, as demonstrated in Episode 25.

Conversation Episode 25

24 T: 你是一个好学生 [You are a good student]{‘smart’ emoji}   
25 S9: 谢谢老师[Thank you teacher]   
26 S9: {A happy sticker}

The student’s comment on her brother rendered the conversation more casual and informal. The teacher maintained the frame by giving positive responses, encouraging the student to share more about her personal life. In Line 11, S5 was cautious about sending casual chats, perhaps due to his conception that the group should only be used for class-related issues. The legitimacy of casual chatting using Chinese was co-constructed by S9 and the teacher in Lines 15 and 19. In Line 15, S5 sent a long Chinese-only, error-free sentence that was beyond beginner’s level. We speculate that the student used translation software or asked for help from a NS. Since the sentence could not be comprehended easily by the audience (although the in-built translation function of WeChat could be used), from Lines 16 to 18, the teacher implied that the sentence was beyond the requirements of the course, which was accomplished using emojis to soften the tone. The teacher also advocated casual chats in Line 19 in English, code-switching for ideational function. In Lines 20 and 21, S9 confirmed her identity, implying her desire to be recognised as a competent Chinese user. The teacher’s responses from Lines 22 to 27 were purely in Chinese (sometimes in multimodal forms), supporting S9’s construction of a positive language user identity.

In summation, different sources of language were applied, and scaffolding was required to maintain an embracing environment for authentic communication. Choosing Chinese (from a CMD perspective) was mostly associated with interpersonal and affective functions and indexing a competent language user identity, while other non-student, authentic social identities were also activated.

# 4.2.3.  Chinese language use facilitated by multimodality

The use of Chinese employed different modes6 , the most frequent being Chinese characters (used in 58 conversation episodes). Other modes included stickers/pictures (44 episodes), Pinyin (11 episodes), and voice messages (3 episodes). The frequency totalled more than 61 because more than one mode was used in many episodes (e.g. a mix of typed Chinese characters and stickers with Chinese captions). Multimodal use of Chinese was seen in episodes where textual use of Chinese (in characters or Pinyin) was mixed with pictorial modality (stickers/pictures) and/or aural modality (voice messages). Altogether, 44 episodes $( 7 2 . 1 \% )$ used multimodal Chinese. Figure 6 demonstrates the weekly trend of all modes used.

Figure 6 indicates that the WeChat group promoted using Chinese characters, which was supported by the student survey responses (Figure D1, Appendix D). This may also have been because students learned more Chinese characters, which they were then able to use. The number of Pinyin texts and voice messages remained low. Typing Pinyin tones was not convenient when using mobile-phone keyboards, and sending voice messages was challenging due to low proficiency.

The use of stickers/pictures with Chinese captions increased considerably, echoing the survey result that stickers were perceived as useful by some students (Table D2, Appendix D). Chat history revealed that the multimedia functions of WeChat afforded beginners opportunities to engage in conversations and self-expression. Episode 61 occurred in week 14 after the final class had finished, where stickers, emojis, and pictures were used extensively and creatively.

Conversation Episode 61

1 S11: {Clapping hands sticker with a caption “啥也别说了, 鼓掌吧 [Don’t say anything, just clap your hands]”}

2 S12: {Crying emoji}

Figure 6. N umber of episodes involving different modes of Chinese (WK $=$ week).

4 S12: 最后的课! [The final class!]   
5 S5: {Crying cat sticker}   
6 T: {Class group photograph}   
7 […]   
8 T: Thank you again all for the fantastic semester! 谢谢你们！！[Thank you!!] […]   
9 T: 我们保持联系, next semester见！！[Let’s keep in touch, see you next semester!!]   
10 T: {Sticker with a caption “辛苦了 [Thanks for your hard work]”}   
11–13 […]   
14 S7: {Sticker showing a love heart}   
15 S10: {Picture with S7’s photograph and a caption in tone-free Pinyin “zhen   
de ma [‘really’ used as interrogation]”}   
16 S6: 我很爱你的课 [I love your class very much] {dancing penguin emoji}   
17 […]   
18 S7: Ahahaa that 照片 [photograph] ain’t going anywhere   
19 T: {Laughing sticker with a caption “哈哈哈哈” [Hahahaha]}   
20 S3: Semester 2 见\~ [See you semester 2]

Here, S11 used a sticker with a Chinese caption that he would not be able to say in Chinese at his proficiency level: ‘啥也别说了, 鼓掌 吧’, literally meaning ‘don’t say anything, just clap your hands’. S12’s crying sticker and emoji were used to create contextual cues for interpreting her textual utterance ‘最后上课！ (The last class!)’ (Lines 2–5) as sad and emotional. Interestingly, S10 posted a self-made sticker (Line 15) that was created from a classmate’s photograph, with the caption ‘zhen de ma’ in Pinyin meaning ‘really?’ added. This was a way of expressing emotion and an attempt to joke with the class for a sense of belonging. The multimodal practices illustrated the potential of WeChat groups for promoting student agency in playing with language and for creating a sense of ownership for learning experiences.

# 4.2.4.  Limitations of authentic language use on WeChat

The survey results and chat histories indicated that students still used English frequently for communication. The survey asked students to name the language(s) they usually employed on WeChat, as shown in Table 2. Almost $5 0 \%$ of students stated that English was the most frequently-used language, constituting $4 8 . 1 \%$ $\mathrm { ~  ~ \tilde { ~ } n = 3 9 ~ }$ ) of the cohort. Many stated they were not comfortable using Chinese due to their limited proficiency. Further, $3 8 . 3 \%$ of students $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 1 \right)$ ) used a mix of English and Chinese. Although these students were also concerned about their limited Chinese, they continued to practice.

Table 2. S tudent choices of language on WeChat.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Choice of language</td><td>Number of students</td><td>Percent</td></tr><tr><td>English</td><td>39</td><td>48.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Mix of English and Chinese</td><td>31</td><td>38.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese</td><td>7</td><td>8.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>4</td><td>4.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>81</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></body></html>

The limitation of ‘frequent use of English’ was mentioned by some students $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 \right)$ (Figure D2, Appendix D); for example, ‘Knowledge of Chinese [was] still too limited to really create conversations.’ Some students $\left( \mathtt { n } = 5 \right)$ suggested that creating authentic interactions would improve WeChat experiences of language learning (Figure D3, Appendix D). Generally, authentic language learning on WeChat was predominantly constrained by language proficiency.

# 5.  Discussion

The increased WeChat engagement manifested during the course, as evidenced by the diachronic analysis of WeChat history, paralleled Krueger’s (2014) study in which MALL resulted in substantial increases in student motivation. This study found that student engagement became more frequent and complex and involved more students. The challenge related to learner variables found in this study has also been recognised in previous literature. As Reinhardt (2019) notes, the double-edged sword of peer and authentic audiences on SNS empowers some learners while intimidating others. Accordingly, individual preferences should be considered (Huang, 2019; Jin, 2018).

The results are not consistent with Huang’s (2019) study, which found that student motivation and participation in WeChat tasks declined towards the end of the program. This is possibly because WeChat was used in Huang’s study formally, whereas students voluntarily participated for their own purposes in ours. It is reasonable to argue that increased engagement in this study might have been caused by students’ higher language proficiency and increased familiarity with their peers; however, as Huang’s (2019) study illustrates, higher engagement is not always guaranteed toward the end of the semester. The nature of the tools and activities adopted seems to explain the different results. Resistance to using SNS for formal language learning has been reported in previous studies (Kessler, 2009). The dilemma seems to be using SNS for pedagogical intervention while not diminishing the flexibility of the experience. We suggest that out-of-class WeChat discussion groups serve as a ‘semi-formal’ (Reinhardt, 2019, p. 25) use of SNS, having the uncritical quality of informal groups (Liaw & English, 2013) with scaffolding, if required (Reinhardt, 2019). Teacher utterances are also conducive to a welcoming atmosphere, allowing students to express themselves using their full semiotic repertoire.

The results further provide evidence for the use of Chinese to achieve authentic goals. Promoting authentic language use by beginners is a recognised challenge in the literature (Huang, 2019; Sung & Poole, 2017). However, WeChat affords unique resources for novice learners, due to its low-stress environment (Jin, 2018), and enables them to utilise multiliteracies and to identify as competent Chinese language users. Multilingual and multimodal practices extend semiotic resources, facilitating the exploration and expression of identity (Vandergriff, 2016) and the use of Chinese served interpersonal and affective functions. One example of this is the exclamatory expression 真的吗？ (Zhen de ma? meaning ‘Really?’) found on Line 18 of Episode 25 and Line 15 of Episode 61. This term is used in the textbook dialogue and students were guided in class to play with the sound (saying it in an exaggerated tone) to show emotions in different contexts (e.g. surprise, astonishment, excitement, or sadness). It was then frequently employed in WeChat and classroom conversations by students. Affective functions were typically seen when switching from L2 to L1, since people tend to feel more emotional when using L1 (Dewaele & Nakano, 2013). However, we found that learners also switched to L2 to express emotions, signalling rapport and solidarity.

There is a question pertaining to the extent to which group chats could be considered authentic. Teacher–learner and learner–learner interactions in class groups are often considered formal and therefore unauthentic. However, we argue that such interactions can also constitute authentic communication if achieving authentic goals. Although authenticity is occasionally understood narrowly as communication between NSs (Alptekin, 2002), alternative interpretations consider the ‘communicative way of language use’ and ‘the engagement of the procedures for making sense’ (Widdowson, 1983, p. 30). Tensions between teaching–learning situations and real-life communication can be resolved when different types of authenticity, such as authentic materials, purposes, and interactions (Arnold, 1991), are applied simultaneously. In this study, conversations regarding practical class affairs and casual purposes could benefit language exposure, considering the notion of familiar authentic environments into which learners regularly enter (Shadiev et  al., 2017).

Some may question whether authentic language use is possible at the beginner level since beginners often use a mix of English and Chinese. However, this study holds that code-mixing and code-switching do not preclude language from authentic communication. This argument echoes the increased attention given to translanguaging practices in language education, which refers to the complex language practices of bilinguals who use certain features of their one integrated linguistic repertoire for effective communication flexibly and strategically (García & Li, 2014). Many different communication resources used co-ordinately to satisfy communicative purposes are stored in this translanguaging linguistic repertoire (Sun, Qiu, & Zheng, 2021). The traditional view of language isolation (isolation of the target language and considering the use of L1 a failure) poses a paradox because the focus is on monolingualism when the goal is to develop multilingual competences (Cenoz & Gorter, 2020). Therefore, using a mixture of Chinese, English and multimodal resources is considered a translanguaging practice for authentic communicative purposes instead of a mere deficiency in the target language.

These findings have practical implications for teacher–student interactions in WeChat class groups. It has been suggested that teachers carefully scaffold using textbook language for class management, explaining language points and casual chatting. Some thinking time may be necessary before responding to student inquiries to consider whether textbook language could be adapted to match a beginner’s proficiency level. Expressions frequently used for class management and making inquiries can be added as extra resources, as they are useful linguistic resources in familiar authentic environments (Shadiev et  al., 2017). There are substantial emergent opportunities for using these types of expressions in group chats. For some expressions far beyond the learner level, translingual practices are helpful for reducing anxiety, facilitating communication, and creating solidarity in the group. Moreover, multimodal communication on WeChat can promote beginners’ language use (Jin, 2018; Wang et  al., 2016). Students can also be instructed on creating stickers with Chinese captions to express themselves, as demonstrated in Episode 61. Ultimately, a sense of ownership is important for successful MALL environments (Kukulska-Hulme, 2009).

These suggestions all require teacher agency, strategy and mindfulness when scaffolding in the dynamic environment of moment-to-moment interactions in group chats. Our study supports Liaw and English’s  (2013) notion that associating informal activities out of class with formal in-class learning using SNS tools requires considerable commitment and open-mindedness among instructors, as students now have more control over the activities and the pace of their learning. It also echoes Yang et  al.’s (2014) view that since individual students participate in online learning for distinct purposes and do not participate at equal levels, teachers should develop different relationships with the students and play multiple roles using a range of technological features. This study suggests that instructors interested in adopting MALL are required to develop an awareness of the dynamic ecology created by mobile technologies and to consistently explore the fit between the potential of technologies and the local situations (see also Tong, An, & Zhou, 2020).

# 6.  Conclusion

Through diachronic enumeration of chat histories and microanalysis of transcripts, we captured the developing patterns and dynamics of engagement and language practices in casual group chats. The data demonstrated increased participation and Chinese language use in WeChat class groups over a semester. The results also revealed how opportunities for authentic language use were created through multilingual and multimodal practices.

Theoretically, the study contributes to the literature on MALL and SNS-enhanced language learning by addressing debates over its effects on learner engagement and the authenticity of interactions, drawing on semi-formal use of the group chat function. Pedagogically, since out-of-class discussion groups are easily established by tutors and are adopted by many Chinese tutors worldwide, research into the potential of such settings would inform Chinese teaching widely. Although we only focused on one institution in Australia, the insights gained from this case study can benefit other similar programs or inspire teaching practices in other diverse contexts. We also call for multiple-case studies and larger-scale quantitative research to address the limitations of this study mentioned in the Methodology section. Future studies could also compare student participation and language use in informal chats and formally designed tasks since each presents distinct challenges and opportunities for language use and student motivation.

# Notes

1. The languages spoken by only one student as his/her L1 include French, Indonesian, German, Italian, Mongolian, Vietnamese, Burmese, Dari and Polish.   
2. For instance, Herring and Androutsopoulos (2015) suggest that CMD research areas include six broad themes: classification of CMD, discourse structure, meaning, interaction management, social practice (including multilingual practice), and multimodal CMD. Due to space constraints, we cannot consider all levels of CMD and only focus on the most relevant.   
3. In this and subsequent transcripts, each numbered item contains one WeChat message.   
4. AR is the abbreviation of Augmented Reality. A typical camera app using AR is Faceu, which allows users to choose from a variety of stickers or add effects in real-time when taking selfies and videos.   
5. M8 refers to ‘mate’.   
6. Mode is used here instead of modality because Chinese characters and Pinyin are different modes (or forms) of Chinese. Pinyin is the romanisation of characters; hence, users undergo different mechanisms when comprehending or producing these two diverse modes. However, they are both considered textual modality vis-a-vis pictorial and aural modalities.
