This study examines a student's translingual practices and language ideologies in her academic writing process in a transnational higher education (TNHE) context to explore how translingual practices can help increase students' critical language awareness (CLA), which has been found to prevent under monolingual ideologies. A case study was adopted to collect the student's screen recordings, stimulated recall interviews, and written products pertaining to one of her academic writing projects. The findings reveal a translingual feature of her language practices but a monolingual orientation to her language ideologies. This mismatch indicates the necessity of raising students' CLA in TNHE contexts, especially those with an English medium instruction (EMI) policy. Pedagogical implications, such as involving translingual practices in self-reflective writing, discussing social justice issues based on these translingual writing practices, and promoting rhetorical agency by challenging native speakerism/monolingualism, are provided to help increase CLA through translingual practices in EAP writing education. This study enriches the theoretical purport of scholarship on translingual practice (Canagarajah, 2018) and argues for the pedagogical values of increasing CLA through translingual practices in EMI-TNHE contexts.

# 1. Introduction

The rapid development of globalization has expanded and sped the transnational movements of people and institutions (Duff 2015), which are mainly driven by neoliberalism (De Costa et a., 2021, 2022). Ensuing these movements, a large number of transnational universities (universities cllaborated between instutions from different countries or betwen foreign insttions and local governments) emerge worldwide, aiming to cultivate global citizens (Fang & Baker, 2018) and enhance translingual and transcultural competence (MLA Ad Hoc Committe on Foreign Languages, 2007). An English medium instruction (EMI) policy i commonly enacted at these transnational universtie. A widly accted definition of MI is \*the use of the English language to teach academic subjects in countries or jurisdictions where the first language (L1) of the majorit of the population i not English." (Dearden, 2014,p.2). The implementation of EMI policy is due to the neoliberal ideology (Flubacher & Del Percio, 2017; Holborow, 2012), the pursuit of in. tenational reputation (De Costa et al., 2019; iller & Cho, 2013), and the reality that English has become a lingua franca in various academic and economic contexts (Zhang, 2018). However, an EMI policy that emphasizes the hegemonic status of prestigious English varieties (such as American and British English) has elicited concerns from scholars regarding the reinforcement of monolingual ideologies (Bou Ayash, 2016), the retriction of knowledge production in local languages (Kirkpatrick, 2014), the commodification of language education (De Costa et al., 2019), and the issues of diversity, inclusion, equity, and access (De Costa et al., 2021). These studies scrutinize the rationales and problems of an EMI policy implemented i transnational higher education (TNHE) (\*characterized by the transformation of higher education across the globe" (De Costa et al., 2022, p. 80) contexts and build a foundation to investigate this growing domain.

As a rising politico-economic power in the world, China is actively involved in these transnational movements. The Sino-Foreign cooperation in running schools (known as 5/1Ft zhong wai he zuo ban xue) has developed from Sino-Foreign cooperative programs in the late 1990s to Sino-Foreign joint-venture universties in the recent decade, aiming to \*strengthen international exchange and cooperation in the field of education and promoting the development of the educational cause." (MOE, 2003, Article 1). The Sino-Foreign cooperative programs have increased from 71 in 1995 to 2,238 by the end of 2019, covering 29 Chinese provinces and cities and 800 institutions from about 40 nations and regions worldwide (China Education Online, 2020). Acording to this report, there were 88 Sino-Foreign joint-venture (transnational) institutions with more than 150,000 new students each year and more than 600,000 enrolled students in China by the end of 2019, more than $9 0 \%$ of which were in higher education. However, this rapid increase in TNHE in China has not led to a corresponding increase in related language and litracy research (McKinley et al., 2021). In a very small number of related studies, researchers have investigated the historical development (Hayhoe & Pan, 2015; Huang, 2016), the current challenges (Han, 2017; Perrn, 2017), and the pedagogical strategie (Ergenc, 2020; Hiler, 2021) associated with THE in China.

The power relations between English and Chinese have also been explored in TNHE contexts in China. These studies find an asymmetrical power relationship between Chinese students and their English-speaking peers (Ou & Gu, 2021) and a mismatch between an EMI policy and individual language practices in multilingual contexts (Wan & Gao, 2020). Liu (2022) examines the viewpoints of Chinese English Language Teaching (ELT) stakeholders (university students, teachers, and administrators) on native speakerism (\*native-speaker teachers represent a Westen culture from which springs the ideals both of the English language and of English language teaching methodology." (Hllday, 2005, p. 6). He finds that 'most f the participants . conferred upon NS [native speaker] products (teacher, language, culture and teaching methodology) a status superior to that they granted to the NNS [nonnative speaker] counterparts and failed to see the linguacultural and epistemological inequalities between the English speaking West and traditional N countries, inter alia, Chin. native seakrism is sil kicking in China's E. (p. 236). More specifically, u and Gu (2021) investigate Chinese students' language practices attitude, and identitie in an EMI-THE context in China. They find that the power relations between language resources and language users in that context reflect English native speakerism, which silences Chinese students and pushes them into avulnerable Englishas a Second Language (ESL) speaker position. Li and Shen (2021) contend that language education in China indicates a monolingual orientation due to the prevailing native speakerism and the preference for fully immersive learning of the target language; thus, they call for a translingual approach to language education in China. These studies reveal that the power relations symbolized by language ideologies and sociopolitical dynamics are prevented under monolingual assumptions ie, languages as static, discrete, and monolitic linguistic entities and native' language standards as idel learning and teaching goals). Therefore, it i essential to raise students critical language awarenes (CLA) to comprehend the unequal power relations between language resources in EMI-TNHE contexts in China.

Although translingual practices have been proposed and discussed as a critical and resistant approach to language and writing education, there are misconceptions about viewing translingual practices as equal to codemeshing (will be elaborated on later inthis article) (Schreiber & Watson, 2018). In addition, translingual practices in academic writing in EMI-TNHE contexs are underexplored. Therefore, the present study aims to enrich the theoretical purport of scholarship on translingual practice (Canagarajah, 2018) i.e, translingual practices should not be seen merely as the hybrid use of named languages but as the meaning-making process with the assemblage of divers semiotic resources. It also argues for the pedagogical values of increasing CLA through translingual practices in academic writing in EMI-TNHE contexts.

# 2. CLA in writing education

CLA, as aterm, was initilly proposed and developed in the early 1990s to respond to the void of power and ideological relations (Clark et al., 1990) and sociopolitical dynamics (Fairclough, 1992) in language awareness (LA) studies. LA, defined as "explicit knowledge about language, and conscious perception and sensitivity in language learning, language teaching and language use" (ALA), has been questioned for \*ignoring] isues of ideology, subject-positioning, and power, [which] i in danger of complicity with social inequalities maintained by language (Clark & Ivani c, 199, p. 63). These ideology, identity, and power isue that are essential for developing language capabilities, resisting oppression, and taking action for change (Clark et al., 1990) are often unaware in writing teaching, learning, and practicing processes (Fairclough, 1992). Therefore, a CLA approach (Clark & Ivani i, 1997, 1999; Leonard, 2021; Shapiro, 2022) is necessary for writing educators to raise students awareness of how power relations, ideological processes, identity formations, and social justice are intersected with writing practices for meaning-making. Accordingly, a CLA approach is construed as \*the intersections of language, identity, power, privilege, with the goal of promoting self-refection, social justice, and rhetorical agency among student writers." (Shapiro, 2022, p. 4).

Scholars have discussed the principles of a CLA approachto guide writing teaching and learning. Clark and Ivanic (1999) propose three CLA principles, i., socily situated learning, mainstreaming, and a questioning approach. They contend that a CLA approach should situate academic writing practices in intitutional and social contexts, matter o al students rather than the minoritized or racialized students, and question the purpose, the way, the interest, and the power relations behind the writing practice.Britton and Leonard (2020) argue that a CLA approach should help students notice how writing practices are embedded in power relations and ideological processes (noticing), question the prescriptive language and writing norms (evaluating), and recognize the relationship between language, power, identit, and privilege (reraming) (p. 3). Based on these studies, Shapiro (2022) summarizes and elucidates

six principles of a CLA approach, i.e.,

(a)includes students from all language backgrounds, (b) uses language as a bridge into ocial justice learning, (c) engages minds, hearts, and bodies, (d) links awarenessto action, (e) works with tensions around linguistic norms/standards, and (f) builds on best practices for writing/literacy instruction. (pp. 62-71).

These principles provide guidance for enacting a CLA approach in the writing classroom; however, practice details vary vastly by he rhetorical situation (such as audience, purpose, and context). Thus, as Crookes (2021) claims, a CLA approach should be implenented concerning institutional, social, cultural, and individual values and their implications.

Writing activities and teaching goals have been exemplified and illstrated to operationalize a CLA approach. One of the early operationalizations of a CLA approch is Hlary Janks (1993) criticl litracy curriculum in South Africa, which ms to rise students awareness of isues on diversty, inclusion, and oppresion by involving multilingualism, mediacriticism, and peer communication topics in teaching. ther activities, such as comparing readings of readers with different ideologie (Clark & Ivanc, 1997), comparing a written scrnplay with the text of its peformance (Clark, 199), reading and reflcting on different written genre (Huang, 2013), reading, discussing, and writing CLA-related topics (Mendoza, 2018), and analyzing students pre-and post essays (Hankerson, 2022) have been employed under a CLA aproach to raise students' awareness of how writing practices intersect with ideology, power, identity, and privilege. Grounded on these studies, Shapiro (2022) proposes three CLA pedagogical goals, i.e, promoting self-reflection, socil justic, and rhtoricl agncy. She links self-reflection to identitie, experiences, atitdes, and behaviors, associates social justice with privile rejudice, discrimination, and empowerment, and relates rhetorical agency to critical literacy and informed decision-making (p. 59). These activities and goals have inspired scholars and practitioners in diffrent macro and micro contexts. As previously mentioned, a CLA approach is crucial to raising students awarenessof the intersection between language, ideology, power, identity, and privilege; however, it has not garnered much attention in EMI-TNHE contexts where monolingualism still prevails (Bou Ayash, 2016). Translingual practices that have been viewed as les of a choice than an everyday realit of multilinguals' language use (Arnold, 2016) can potentially increase students' CLA in EMI-TNHE contexts.

# 3. Students' translingual practices in writing

Translingual practices, the assemblage of diverse semiotic resources for meaning-making (Canagarajah, 2013, 2018), have been increasingly implemented to facilitate writing teaching and learning. Students translingual practices have been found to be conducive to helping them challenge monolingual ideologies. English monolingualism has dominated writing teaching and learning in and outside Anglo-American contexts (Horner et l., 2010), including THE contexts (De Costa et al., 2021), which has far-reaching effects on students' ideology formation in their writing processes. For example, monolingual ideologies highlight \*native standards" static, discrete, and monolithic) as learning and teaching goals in writing education, which reinforces the deficit view on multilingual writing and writers. Studies that explore students' translingual writing practice, such as poetry writing (Barbour & Lickorish Quin, 2020), translating (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020), and literacy narrative (Hartse et al., 2018) across language resources, have uncovered that translingual practices are beneficial for student writers to challenge monolingualism by viewing language resources other than the dominant one as assets rather than hindrances and considering multilingual writers as agentive, critical, and creative rather than deficit language users. Monolingual ideologies are problematic but til dominant in students writing processes. Translingual practices question and resist this dominance and advocate for an asset rather than a deficit approach to writing education.

Students' translingual practices have also been shown essential to empower them with writer agency in shaping their own lan. guage. The advocacy for writer agency can be traced back to the 1974 Conference on College Composition and Communication statement (Conference on College Composition and Communication, 1974), "Student's Right to Their Own Language", which call for legitimizing English varietes/dialects in students academic writing. Grounded on thiscall different concepts, such as contact zones (Pratt 191), codemeshing (Yong, 2004), and a translingual aproach (Horner e l., 2011), have been proposed to empower student writers to make meaning with their diverse semiotic resources that are stuated in temporal-spatial and sociocultural contexts.In this sense, writer agency is not only manifested in the deviations from language norms and writing conventions but also in every activity in and for the writing processinsomuch as writing i performative, contingent, emergent, synergistic, and negotiated (Canagarajah, 2018; Lu & Horner, 2013, 2016). The examination of students translingual practice in writig, such as multimodal composing with different anguage resources (Gonzales, 2015; Sun et al., 2021), poetry writing with cultural/linguistic/racial-related names (Machado & Hartman, 2020), and telecollaborative writing between two college classrooms in the U.S. and Japan (Kato & Kumagai, 2022), has revealed the benefits of translingual practices for student writers in making active, critical, and professonal voices in academic writing. These studies argue that writing scholars and practitioners hould be more open to and inclusive of students unconventional language use to empower them with writer agency.

Students' translingual practices have been viewed as learning strategies to cultivate their rhetorical sensibility. A rhetorical sen. sibility, a critical wareness of language as a contingnt and emeget, rather than  tandrdized and static, practce (Guerra, 2016, p. 2), has been discussed to respond to the misconceptions between codemeshing and translingual practices. Canagaraah (2013) explains that \*whil codemeshing often charactrizes theend-product of many multilinguals, translingual ractice can lead to products approximating sWE [Standard Written English] also. (p. 188). Therefore, what is important frstudents' translingual practices is not how many named languages or language varieties mesh in the text but how these language/language variety resource are synergistic and negotiated to make meanings in their writing proceses (Gilyard, 2016; Lu & Horner, 2016). Translingual writing activities, such as self-reflective writing (Guerra, 2016), potry writing (Kim & Park, 2020), and digital writing (Schreiber, 2015), have been investigated and discussed to understand writing as translingual practice, i., writing is a meaning-making process with the assemblage of various semiotic resources, individual experiences, and sociopolitical elements. From this perspective, a rhetorical sensibility views code meshing as a mattr f agency (Schreiber & Watson, 2018; Sun, 2022) and advocates for adopting and understanding translingual practices based on dynamic and complex rhetorical situations.

Translingual practices have been increasingly enacted in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) writing classrooms, bringing both benefit and challenge (Sun, 2022). Studies have shown that translingual practices can benefit EAP writing education by challenging monolingualism (Hiller, 2021), advocating for writer agency (Canagarajah, 2015), increasing students rhetorical sensibility (Cavazos, 2017), viewing language resources other than English as assets rather than hindrances (Caragarajah & Matsumoto, 2017), creating open and inclusive educational environments (Flores & Aneja, 2017), and enhancing students' metalinguistic awareness (Kim & Chang, 2022). Albeit with these benefit, there are challenges to implementing translingual practices in the EAP writing classroom, such as the dominance of English monolingualism in both institutional and social contexts (Arnold, 2016), teachers' and students concerns about codemeshing (Kafe, 2020), the lack of guidance in students' and teachers' translingual practices (Bou Ayash, 2016), and the potential to marginalize some linguistically minoritized students (Kuteeva, 2020). These challenges can be mitigated by enacting translingual practices based on rhetorical situations, adopting a process rather than a product approach to translingual practices, and raising students awareness of a monolingual understanding of language norms and writing conventions rather than resisting them in EAP writing education (Sun, 2022. These writing studies have shown the potential of translingual practices in helping increase students CL (i, promoting self-reflection, socia justice, and rhtorical agency). The preent study, ths, adresses the following research question:

How does a student in an EMI-TNHE context in China use and perceive translingual practices in her EAP writing process?

This study aims to enrich the theoretical purport of translingual practice. I is worth noting that this study does not examine a CLA pedagogy in an EAP classroom but argues for the pedagogical values of increasing CLA through translingual practices in academic writing in EMI-TNHE contexts, which will be elucidated with data examples in subsequent sections.

# 4. Methods

This study was conducted with regulations for ethical research approved by the Institution Review Board (IRB) of a research orientated, liberal arts transnational university in China based on a larger case study, which explored a student's negotiations of language difference in her academic writing process. The larger case study, including research foci on EAP writing asessment, feedback, and development, examined how the student used and perceived diffrent language resources in her academic writig process, how she situated her language practices in institutional, academic, and social contexts, why she valued particular resources more than others for particular rhetorical goals, and how the student's language practices, knowledge, and ideologies imply for language and writing education. The present study centers on how translingual writing practices can help raise the student's CLA in academic writing in an EMI-TNHE context. A case study was selected insomuch as investigators can explore real-life phenomena through detailed and in-depth data collection and analysis (Creswel, 2013). A single rather than multiple-case design was selected in that it allowed me to be \*integrally involved in the case (Hitchcook & Hughes, 1995, p. 137) by interacting with the participant periodically during the study. Focusing on a single case is appropriate and practicable for an in-depth exploration of the student's translingual practices and language ideologies in academic writing with detailed data. Therefore, centering on a single participant enabled me to examine the complexity and uniquenes of this case in a real-life context and provide implications for similar cases. The primary criteria for selecting the participant were that s/he was a multilingual student, learning in an EMI-TNHE context, in EAP classes or a process of academic writing, and willing to share his/her views on the matter.

# 4.1. Context and participant

The case examined occurred at a transnational universit established as a partnership between a U.S. university and a Chinese university in eastern China. Following an EMI policy, allChinese students except those who have completed their secondary education in international schools with EMI are required to take and pas first-year EAP courses that aim to cultivate students academic literacy skills and international students take Chinese courses. As a distinguishing feature of undergraduate education at this university, students are encouraged to do research and are required to develop Signature Work (SW) products. Students need to submit their SW proposals in their third year and finish and submit their SW products by the end of their fourth year for gaduation. To prepare students for their SW, two elective advanced EAP writing courses are provided to help students develop SW proposals and papers, respectively, and students can take them anytime from their sophomore to senior years.

The participating student (Tong, a pseudonym) was in the two advanced EAP writing courses I taught when the case study was conducted. During the case study, Tong was also doing an independent study with me to investigate how to develop an interactive and problem-based tutorial system. Tong, from Hubei province of China, was a junior student when participating in this study. She is a speaker of Mandarin Chinese (her "native\*/first language in her own words) and English (her second language) which she has been learning since kindergarten. She viewed herself as an English as a foreign language (EFL) learner with much academic training in this intensive EMI-TNHE context, which helped her be familiar, confident, and comfortable with writing in English for academic purposes. Chinese and English were two primary language resources that Tong used to negotiate and construct meaning in her academic writing process To prepare for her W, she took one of the advanced EAP writing courses to develop her W proposa in all 2021 and took the other to construct her SW paper in Spring 2022. It i necessary to mention the ethical aspect of my dual role as both a reearcher and a teacher in that it may create power imbalances that could afect Tong's decisions on whether to participate or not. To mitigate this ethical issue, besides my oral introduction to the research ideas, I provided a written consent form (based on the IRB protocols) for Tong to understand this research project her right to participate voluntarily and withdraw at any time during the research, and the confidentiality of her private information. In adition, Itrie to minimize my inluence n Tong's behaviors and reponses (Yin, 018) by not introducing her to the concepts of CLA and translingual practices during the data collection process. Intead, Iinroduced the research ideas by informing her that I would investgate how she used and understod diffrent language resource in her academic writing process.

# 4.2. Data collection

Following a case study convention (Creswell 2013), different types of data were collected from an emic (participant-focused) perspective to have an in-depth understanding of Tong's language practice, ideologies, and experiences. The main data types included screen recordings, audio recordings, and textual files. Specificall, all data were collected from Tongs academic writing process pertaining to her tutoria system project, on which she worked with me in the advanced EAP writing classes and the independent study from December 2021 to May 2022. During the data collction period, Tong was asked to record her laptop screen when conducting activities related to her tutorial system project with Zoom and share the screen recordings with me. The recorded activities included searching relevant publications, reading and evaluating articles, organizing materials, outlining written work, and drafting and revising written products (i.e, her SW proposal and paper). Tong did not turn on the camera and microphone during the screen re. cordings; therefore, the data did not include Tong's think-aloud and physical activities. Instead, the screen recordings showcased Tong's language practices, which helped investigate how translingual practices were situated in her academic writing process. The screen recordings lasted $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 1 5 { \mathrm { ~ m i n } }$ , depending on the writing activities conducted. Tong said that she paused the recording when doing irrelevant things or needing a long time to read and think to minimize the lengths and sies of the recordings, which indicated that the shorter recordings did not necessarily reflect the corresponding length of time pent on her academic writing activities.

To understand how Tong perceived and illustrated her language practices, stimulated recall interviews were conducted by watching the screen recordings as stimuli every time she shared the scren recordings. Since I shared a similar ethnic (Chinese) and sociolinguistc (Chinese and English) background with Tong, the stimulated recall interviews were carried out in Chinese as suggested by Tong, and they were audio-recorded for research purposes. The stimulated recall interviews lasted $5 0 { - } 7 8 \mathrm { m i n }$ (the screen recordings were sped up when there were long pauses and repetitie activities during watching). Albeit Tong suggested Chinese, she frequently meshed English and Chinese to construct and negotiate meaning during the stimulated recall interviews. To triangulate the findings, Tong's written products such as outlines and drafts of her SW proposal and paper, were colected to explore how she situated hersef and languag resources in spefic literate situations and how her languag ideologies, identitie, and attitudes were reflected in the writing proces. Classroom observation notes were aso collcted to support the main data. Regarding the power relations between Tong and me, concepts of CLA and translingual practices were not introduced to Tong during the data collection proces (as mentioned above to elicit relatively unbiased pinions. In sum, the main collected data were atgorized into thr tyes (i., video, audio, and textual), see Table 1.

# 4.3. Data analysis

Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the collected data for its flexibility in organizing, identifying, reporting, and analyzing themes across various data types (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Thematic analysis is primarily used in qualitative research to provide a rich, detailed, and complex acount of data, which helps reearchers summarie the key features acros data sets and facilitates reearchers to produce clear, thorough, and well-oranized reorts (King, 2004; Lapadat, 2012). Hwever, thematic analys is concened about its potential inconsistency and incoherence when developing themes identified from the rearch data (Nowell e al., 2017). To promote consistency and coherence and ensure rigorous and reliable analysis, I adopted two analytical methods (deductive coding and inductive coding) to triangulate the findings. The deductive coding was conducted based on the research question, and the inductive coding was carried out following the themes that emerged in the data sets. The data analysis started with deductive coding, during which  familiarized myself wth the overall databy watching the screen recording, listening to and transcribing the stimulated real interviews, reading the participant's written product, and taking notes based on the research question. The inductive coding, then was carried out based on the themes that emerged in the three data sets, which also helped refine the research question.

The deductive and inductive codings were conducted iteratively to identify representative paterns (such as translingual practices in different forms (written and oral, Tong's monolingual ideologies, and the mismatch between Tong's language practices and ideologies). Extracts from the dat ets we seleted bad on their rreenttives to support further dcssion. Spcificlly, the data analysis was conducted based on the following steps, see Table 2..

To ensure the confidentiality of data, a pseudonym was used to refer to the participant. Any identifiable information related to the

The participant consented to the use of video, audio, and textual data.

# 5. Translingual practices in EAP writing

Since the focus of ths study is to examine translingual practices in Tong's academic writing proces, iti necessary to report and discuss language reources used in Tong's writen products first a they ae the most direct indexicals sedimented grammatical status and norms for representing meaning (Canagarajah, 2018)- with which most (potential) readers can interact. The textual data from the 14 Word files show that, from the perspective of language form, Tong's academic writing was dominated by English, and her other primary language resource i., Chinese) did not occur in the text regardlessof whether Chinese characters or Pinyin (see Fig. 1).

Tong stated that \*+, 5-#essay##. #5-+\*. " (ince the first day of my colle life ry essy has to be wrt in Engish. I do not writ i hine, then ranat t into glishor switch them during writing). She further explained that this language use phenomenon in her academic writing was affected by her short-term goals (e.g., academic publication in an international journal), her long-term plan (eg., graduate study abroad), her course objectives (e., learning AP writing), the instittional languag policy (i., MI), and the social expectations (, job requirements for English proficiency or overseas study experiences). Albeit with the dominant role, English used in Tong's academic writing could be regarded as \*translingual English" (Dovchin, 2021; Dovchin & Dryden, 2022).

While English played an essential role in the text, Chines facilitated and supported the production of the English text, which could be viewed as translingual English-- \*transnational migrants' English combined with their translingual backgrounds and skills" (Dovchin & Dryden, 2022, p. 7). Although Tong is not a migrant in ths context, her English use was substantiall affected by her translingual background and skill. For instance she searched China National Knowledge Ifrastructure (CNKI), also known as (zhong guo zhi wang)- the most extensive database in China created to integrate academic resources, to understand the subject matter by locating and reading relevant Chinese articles (see Fig. 2).

She said,

When I do not know a field, I wil start with Chinese. For example, when I do not understand some English professional words or when it is time-consuming to understand the meaning of those words, I will read some Chinese papers to have a basic understanding and then start reading English. That is it wll be easier for me to build up a body of knowledge [through Chinese] before reading English. In fact, there is stilla difference between Chinese and English; afer all, Chinese is my mother tongue. (Translation from Tong's interviews).

Tong's ilustrations about why and how Chinese facilitated her academic writing showcased her translingual practices. In this sense, Tong's language practices that were seemingly separated (Chinese in some reading materials and English in her written text) were actually synergistic in building up a knowledge system of the subject mattr, which facilitated the production of the written text. As mentioned above, translingual practices are not only represented in the hybrid use of language resources and the deviations from the conventional language use but in every language activity in that meaning is constructed and negotiated through the synergy of various semiotic resources that are situated in different temporal-spatial and sociocultural contexts (Canagarajah, 2018; Lu & Horner, 2013). Tong's language practices in the written products and the writing processechoVan der Walt's (2013) findings that students, in specific contexts, use diffrent language resources in the writing process but not necessaril in their written drafts or final text. Therefore, translingual practices ned to be understood ased on rhtorical situations, i., writers, audinces, puroses, contexts, and policies, rather than whether and how many language resources mesh in the text (Sun, 2022; Sun & Lan, 2021a).

The assemblage of different semiotic resources also reflected Tongs translingual practice. For instance, Tong used various learning tols, such as her laptop, the YouDao dictionary, and the Adobe Acrobat PDF software (see Fig. 3) to facilitate her EAP writing.

Fig. 3 shows that Tong tried to follow the IRB protocols to conduct her research by reading the items on a PDF file and under standing the content with the YouDao dictionary on her laptop. Diffeent language resource (i.., English and Chinese) on those tools showcased the assemblage of various semiotic resources (e.g., linguistic, color, and digital) in that they were all in concert with one another to build a knowledge system for reaching the rhetorical goal.

Fig. 3. The assemblage of semiotic resources (screenshot).

Not at all it i all subconscious without considering [how many languages are on those tools]. Sometimes, I thought the system language was English on school computers [thesystem language of her laptop was Chinese], on which I also used Google Scholar. Still, I never noticed the language difference between school computers and my laptop. (Translation from Tong's interviews).

Tong explained that this was due to her rich experience using both language resources in this EMI-TnHE context. From the stimulated recll interviews, Tong also mentioned that, besides reading relevant works in and using learning tools with different language resources she frequently communicated with professors, peers, and writing pecialists by meshing English and Chinese to have a clearer, deer, and broader understanding of her research topic and seek feedback for more focused, coherent, and cohesive EAP writing. With the assemblage of different language and semiotic resources, these writing activitis instantiate translingual practices in Tong's academic writing process.

The power relations between language resources in Tong's EAP writing processreflect native speakerism/monolingualism in this EMI-TNHE context. As mentioned above, Tong's language practices could be viewed as translingual; however, the illustrations of her language practices indicated a monolingual orientation to language norms and writing conventions. For example, when asked about what was more important for EAP wring, Tong answered that

Flow, clarity, grammar, and ways of expression are more important. I think the depth of the content is second; the article should be understandable first .. Sometimes, I ask the native speaker to help read my essays, and they llsay, Hey, your expression is directly translated from Chinese, which is a very inauthentic expression. For example, sometimes, you will directly translate some expressions from Chinese to English. You think there is no problem, but in the view of the native speaker, it is very problematic and will affect your expression. (Translation from Tong's interviews).

Tong's explanation reveals a monolingual understanding of language, ie., languages are static, dicrete, and monolithic linguistic entities and L1 norms negatively affect L2 written production. It is noteworthy that Tong viewed Chinese as a helpful resource to understand the subject matter but as a hindrance to producing English text, which denotes that language norms and writing conventions are essntial for enlarging Tong's linguistic reertoire and achieving her rhetorical goal. However, what is problematic is the monolingual understanding of those norms and conventions (native speakerism), i.e., they are fixed, discrete, monolithic, and detrimentally inluenced by one another. It indicates the urgency of raising students' CLA in EMI-TNHE contexts to challenge native speakerism/monolingualism through translingual practices.

These unbalanced power relations between language resources prevent CLA from pursuing "native competence in EAP writing. As mentioned above, Tong frequently consulted "native speakers' for producing \*native-like" writing. In addition, she also used other technological tols to improve her EAP writing. For example, she used Grammarly (ee Fig. 4) to fix grammatical and mechanical e., typo, spelling, and punctuation) issues.

She stated that these tools could help mitigate the negative influence of her L1 (Chinee in this case) by following English norms and writing conventions in EAP writing. These findings reveal that it i essential to increase students CLA to understand the power re lations between language resources for linguistic justice in EMI-TNHE contexts. As Ou and Gu (2021) argue that "although the ethnocultural groups in multilingual and multicultural universities are permeable, it [linguistic injustice] only happens when the linguisticall vulnerable group accommodate themselves to the more powerful language, ften along with the sacrfice of limiting the use of one's mother tongue." (p. 429). Therefore, teacher-scholars and practitioners need to increase students' CLA through translingual practice to understand the power relations, ideology formations, and identity developments between language users, which can help them face and take action on linguisic justice isues that are elicited by native speakerism/monolingualism in EAP writing education in EMI-TNHE contexts.

Fig. 4. Tong's use of Grammarly for writing issues.

The power relations between language resources project not only the linguistic but also the social justice ssues. For instance, ong was an intern at some prestigious companies in China to put theories learned at school into practice and increase her working experience. She commented that language norms including writing and speaking) are more strictly followed in society than at university. She said,

He [Tong's boss] thinks that some colleagues peak relatively standard English and some colleagues are not at that level, then he will have aslight value bias against this erson in this regard. . He willfeel that this person may not have the ailit to work as well as that person, or that this person does not have global vision. He equates an English accent with an international view... He also says that he prefer[s] intern candidates with study abroad experiences. (Translation from Tong's interviews)

This example reflects monolingual ideologies in specific social contexts and manifests that translingual English discrimination exists not only in English-dominant social contexts (Dovchin & Dryden, 2022) but also in some non-English-dominant ircumstances, such as the one mentioned by Tong. These social justice ssues generated by monolingualism are not exceptional in writing studies (Sun & Lan, 2023), Chinese educational setings (Liu, 2022), and social contexts (Li & Shen, 2021). Tong confirmed these monolingual ideologies by exemplifying that many parents, including hers, view acquiring English \*native" norms as more important than learning professional skills In Tong's words, \*13X##i#,#9iiT#,i#i2#J i#-.  (Many parents feel that way. My mom also tell me that I should improve my Englis kills even though my major courses could not be learned very well. Overall, Tong's language use in her academic writing process showcases translingual practice, her perceptions of translingual practice indicate a mismatch between her language use and language ideologie, and her monolingual ideologies are affected by social environments. These findings indicate a dynamic and complex relationship between Ianguage, power, ideology, identity, and privilege, which is crucial for students to recognize but has been prevented under monolingual assumptions in writing education in EMI-TNHE contexts.

# 6. Increasing CLA through translingual practices

The previous section has exemplified and discussed Tong's translingual practices in her academic writing process, which shows the potential of translingual practice for promoting students CLA (i., self-reflction, social justice, and rhetorical gency) in EMI-TNHE contexts. It i necessary to note again that this study is not to examine aCLA pedagogy in an EAP writing classoom but to explore how language resources were used and perceived in an EAP writing process and discuss how translingual practice can imply the cultivation of CLA that is prevented by monolingualism. Therefore, this section provides pedagogical implications for increasing students' CLA through translingual practices in EAP writing education in EMI-TNHE contexts.

Students CLA can be rased by involving translingual practices in self-reflective writing. Self-reflective writing activities have been increasingly enacted with translingual practices (such as self-reflection on language use across inguistc, cultural, and sociopolitical boundarie to hlp tts critill eflect on thr lauaxpri, a, idties, and jumts. Te stdi (such as Andrew & Fay; 2020; Bou Ayash, 2016) uncover that selfreflective writing with translingual practices can help student writers develop positie, multilingual identities view preexisting knowledge and experience of non-target language as assets rather than hindrances, be more open to and inclusive of unconventional language use, and increase metalinguistic awareness The present study adds supporting evidence to the current literature. For example, I found from the classroom observation that Tong was more active in activities when Chinese was involved in communication (most frequently meshed with English). When asked about this phenomenon in stimulated recall inerviews, Tong explained that involving Chinese in classoom and writing activities equipped her with more linguistic resources, confidence, and knowledge to understand others and reflect on herself. These findings have demonstrated the essential role of translingual practices in balancing the accommodation of and the resistance to the status quo (i., the power of language norms and writing conventions) (Canagarajah, 2013; Flores & Aneja, 2017). In this sense, translingual practices are conducive to enhancing students' self-refection as they can help promote a more just future, while also preparing students for the (often unjust) present." (Shapiro, 2022, p. 59). Tong's language practices, experiences, ideologies, and attitudes in her academic writing proces show a translingual nature of her language use but a monolingual orientation to her language ideologies, which in. dicates the necesst of raising students CLA in EMI-THE contexts to help them understand how language is intersected with power. identty, idology, and privilethrogh transingl practies.  can further inre their awarenessof ow linguistic prudes and discriminations might contribute to or against social justice, which s asociated with the second CLA principle (i.e., social justice).

Students' CLA can be increased by discussing social justice issues based on translingual writing practices. Studies on translingual writing activities, such as academic writing (e.g, Kim & Chang, 2020), digital writing (e.g., Schreiber, 2015), and translating (e.g, Beiler & Dewilde, 2020), have shown the benefits of translingual practices in legitimizing non-dominant language resources and valuing multilingual writing and writers in academic contexts. Translingual practices have been enacted in language and writing education to increase lingustic social justice-- "confronting the inequitable discursive economies that afford disproportionate amounts of social caital to certain language practices over others. (Lee, 2016, p. 176). In other words, translingual practices can help understand why some particular language practices are granted more value than others in relation to sociopolitical powers. This linguistic social justice can help raise students' CLA by "equip[ping] learners to recognize, challenge, and ultimately contribute to changing social inequities inscribed in discourse practice, and thus to be more reponsible citizns. (Clark & Ivanic, 199, p. 64) It is crucial for students to be aware of social justice isues in language and writing learning to act for change. As Tong mentioned, some people even have prejudices about different types of language hybridity; for example, \*#ipaper (I want to read a paper)' is considered more legitimate than readi (1 want to read a paper) (more research is needed to investigate the reasons). Tong's language practices support De Costa et al.'s (2021) claim that translingual realities have characterized transnational institutions. However, Tong's perceptions and experiences of translingual practices indicate a monolingual orientation to language ideologies, which reinforces the perceived necessty of raising students' CLA (potentially through translingual practices) to help them notice, evaluate, and reframe language and writing for social justice.

Students' CLA can be raised by promoting student' rhetorical agency with translingual practices. The third CLA principle is to increase student writers' rhetorical agency--being critical and making thoughtful and informed language decisions. As previously discussed, translingual practices have been implemented to empower writer agency (Horner et al., 2011; Lu & Horner, 2013) and develop a rhetorical sensibilit (Gilvard, 2016; Guerra, 2016). Translingual practices highlight students' agency in shaping their own anguage with their full inguistic repertores and their awareness of the contingent, emergent, ynergistic, and negotiated features of Ianguage, language diffrence, and language use. In other word, transligual practices can help student writers be more critical of dominant language norms and writing conventions and understand how language intersects with power, identity, and ideology to construct and negotiate meanings. Tong's explanation of her preference for using her Chinese rather than English name in this EMI-TNHE context reflected this intersection. A large number of Chinese students use their English names (usuall th firt name) to accommodate their English-speaking pers, professors, and staf in this EMI-NHE context. However, Tong stated that she had an English name, but she preferred to use her Chinese name because that is the name on her official documents (power) (such as her identity card and passort), she is Chinese and grew up in this natio (identity), and she believes that the use of her Chinese name is more professional (ideology). A CLA approach can help students understand this intersection more explicitly and direct them to self-reflect on their language practice, ideologies, attitudes, and behaviors and confront and take action for social justice. And translingual practices can facilitate this process Although Tong had not experienced translingual name discrimination (Dovchin & Dryden, 2022) in this EMI-TNHE context, it might be beneficial to raise her awarenes of this possbility when the power relations change (e.g., study abroad as she planned), which can help inform her language decisions based on rhetorical situations.

The findings ofths study indicated translingual features of Tong's language practices; however, these translingual practices did not lead her to a translingual ideology, i., beliefs in writer agency in shaping their own language, language as contingent, emergent, and negotiated, multilingual writing and writers as assets rather than problems, and heteroglossia rather than monoglossia as the norm. This mismatch compels language and writing teacher-scholars and practitioners in EMI-TNHE contexts to contemplate how to help students elf-rflect on their languag practice, dlogies, idtities, and atitdes, confront and act for social justice, and increase their rhetorical agency through translingual practices.

# 7. Conclusion

This study has discussed how translingual practices were used and perceived by a student in an EMI-TNHE context and how translingual practices could be adopted to raise students CLA. The findings reinforce a translingual reality in EMI-TNHE contexts but reveal the disparity between this rality and the student's language ideologies. Translingual practices have the potential torespond to this disparity and serve as a source for raising students' CLA (i.., self-reflection, social justice, and rhetorical agency), in that translingual practices can help bring students language resources, pre-existing knowledge, social experience, and personal skill into the classroom In this way, translingual practices can help students challenge monolingualism (power), be more confident and agentive as multilingual writr (identity), value non-dominant anguage resource ideology), and criticlly evaluate the hegemony of English in academic contexts (privilege). This prompts language and writing educators in EMI-TNHE contexts to recognize translingual practices as valuable tols to promote diversity, incusion, equity, and aces for asocial justce-centered reframing of Engish language teaching (De Costa et al, 2021) and develop " heightened sense of responsibility, as we understand more deely how language can be used to hurt and divide us, just as it can build connections and promote social healing." (Shapiro, 2022, p. 58).
