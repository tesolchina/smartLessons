# ABSTRACT

This study investigated whether repetitions of a wiki-mediated collaborative writing task with the intervention of consciousness-raising could enhance learners’ attention to past-counterfactual conditional in English and their explicit and implicit knowledge development. Sixty learners worked in pairs to complete the same essay-writing task four times within a 5-week time frame. One group received deductive consciousness-raising after the initial task performance $( { \mathsf { T R } } + { \mathsf { D C R } } )$ ; a second group engaged in inductive consciousness-raising $( \mathsf { T R } + \mathsf { I C R } )$ ; and a third group only repeated the task (TR, control condition). Explicit and implicit knowledge gains were measured via an untimed grammaticality judgment test (UGJT) and an oral production test (OPT), respectively. On the UGJT, the $\mathsf { T R } + \mathsf { I C R }$ led to significant immediate and delayed knowledge gains, while the $\mathsf { T R } + \mathsf { D C R }$ only resulted in immediate enhancement. The $\mathsf { T R } + \mathsf { I C R }$ resulted in gains in OPT and had some advantage over the $\mathsf { T R } + \mathsf { D C R }$ and TR. These findings contribute towards our understanding of the effectiveness of consciousness-raising as a focus on form intervention activity between repeated collaborative task performances with respect to explicit and implicit knowledge at relatively higher levels of second language acquisition.

# Introduction

The development of new technologies presents new ways for language teachers to encourage and foster collaboration in foreign language education. The advent of Web 2.0 tools has provided more opportunities for collaborative writing in the second language (L2) classroom. One such tool is the wiki which can be easily created, viewed and modified using any web browser (Aydin & Yildiz, 2014). The wiki fosters social interaction, mutual assistance, reflection, negotiation, and collaboration— features considered important in Vygotsky’s (1978) socio-cultural accounts for language learning. And practically, the user editability, detailed page history, and transparency of written document to co-writers are the aspects that make the wiki an ideal platform for continuously refining the shared written text, actively reflecting on the process of writing, and becoming more critical of the own and peer’s work (Li & Zhu, 2017). Admittedly, these features of the wiki may enhance the collaborative processes through which learners would be more likely to attend to linguistic features. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how using wikis supports not just the development of explicit, deliberate and conscious knowledge about the grammatical rules (i.e., declarative knowledge) but also knowledge about how to use the rules (i.e., procedural knowledge) (Suzuki & DeKeyser, 2017).

According to skill acquisition theory (DeKeyser, 2015), learners need to engage in practice activities to automatize the procedural knowledge so that it can occur implicitly and automatically with no awareness. Task repetition (TR) is one efficient way to materialize this objective in which “the performance of a task at one time serves as a preparation for the performance of the same task later” (Ellis, 2019a, p. 16). Though still rather limited, a growing number of studies have begun to investigate the role of repeating technology-enhanced tasks in L2 development (e.g., Amiryousefi, 2016; Kartchava & Nassaji, 2019; Kim et  al., 2020, 2021). It is well-acknowledged that collaborative writing in a less pressured and an engaging technology-supported environment reduces learners’ anxiety, promotes collaboration, and consequently leads to enhanced grammatical accuracy (see Su & Zou, 2020 for a comprehensive review). Thus, it is expected that the repeated performances of collaborative writing tasks in less pressured and engaging technological contexts would facilitate interpersonal communication and exchange of knowledge on language use and therefore develop linguistic knowledge. Nevertheless, research findings have indicated that technology-mediated TR can have a positive effect on linguistic accuracy only when it integrates some kind of additional intervention between repeated task performances to effectively raise learners’ linguistic awareness (e.g., corrective feedback in Kim et  al.’s (2020) study and self-assessment in Kartchava & Nassaji’s (2019) study). These findings advocate Ellis’s (2009a) argument that simply repeating a task may not have a measurable influence on language learning unless one type of pedagogical intervention is provided between the repeated task performances.

Recently, Ellis et  al. (2020) have suggested consciousness-raising (CR) activity as an effective example of form-focused intervention between repeated task performances. However, no research, to my knowledge, has examined the impacts of either wiki-mediated TR alone or in comparison with wiki-mediated TR combined with an intervention technique such as CR on L2 learning. Obviously, there is a pedagogical need to investigate the presence or lack of a CR intervention in developing a solid base of explicit knowledge in the wiki environment which could be subsequently proceduralized through repeated task performances. Hence, the present study examined whether the repetition of a wiki-mediated collaborative writing was effective in bringing about explicit and implicit knowledge or whether a CR was needed. It needs to be noted that in line with previous TR studies in L2 writing (e.g., Carver & Kim, 2020; Hidalgo & Lázaro-Ibarrola, 2020; Khezrlou, 2021b; Kim et  al., 2020), task repetition in the current study was operationalized as writing about the exact same topic several times to understand how subsequent performances of the same wiki-mediated task written collaboratively could result in enhanced knowledge of the target structure. In the present study, the explicit and implicit knowledge were measured through an untimed grammaticality judgment test and an oral production test respectively.

# Literature review

# Wiki-mediated collaborative writing

In recent years, collaborative writing has attracted much attention in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). Storch (2013) defines collaborative writing based on three distinguishing features: process, product, and text ownership. Collaborative writing requires a great deal of interaction between all co-authors during the writing process, with the end result being a single text produced jointly. Furthermore, co-authors need to share a sense of ownership over the text they have produced (Storch, 2021). Research has revealed that collaborative writing enhances grammatical accuracy and overall quality of writing (Storch, 2013) and that learners are more likely to actively engage in collaborative activities in computer assisted language learning (CALL) contexts because of the public nature of the information and sense of accountability (Sengupta, 2001). As Kessler (2009) rightly notes, “the evolution of collaborative writing may be intrinsically connected with iterations of technology since new developments provide new opportunities for collaboration” (p. 80). In the present study, learners were engaged in collaborative writing using a wiki platform.

In the field of L2 learning, wikis have been largely utilized for collaborative writing (see Stoddart et  al., 2016 for a review) and as

Godwin-Jones (2003, p. 15) remarks, “wikis are intensely collaborative”. A wiki is defined as a “freely expandable collection of interlinked web pages, a hypertext system for storing and modifying information—a database, where each page is easily edited by any user with a forms-capable Web browser client” (Leuf & Cunningham, 2001, p. 14). Research reported numerous benefits for wiki writing including enhancements in learners’ focus on form (FonF) in terms of language-related episodes (Hsu, 2019), and grammatical accuracy (e.g., Castañeda & Cho, 2013; Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Kuteeva, 2011; Lee, 2010). However, less is known about the potential of collaborative wiki writing in proceduralization of the linguistic knowledge over time. According to skill acquisition theory (DeKeyser, 2015), language development takes place when declarative knowledge evolves into procedural knowledge through practice. That said, the repeated performances of technology-enhanced collaborative tasks are expected to offer the practice necessary to facilitate the proceduralization of explicit knowledge. As Elola & Oskoz (2017) underline, with the aid of technology-enhanced platforms, learners are likely to receive more interactive and meaningful practices with multimodal feedback and become able to monitor the writing progress, attend to language and build joint knowledge in an engaging environment.

# Task repetition

Task repetition is defined as “repetitions of the same or slightly altered tasks–whether whole tasks or parts of a task” (Bygate & Samuda, 2005, p. 43). The impact of TR in terms of freeing up learners’ limited attentional resources (Skehan’s (1998) trade-off hypothesis) has been the subject of an extensive body of research (see Khezrlou, 2020 for a recent review). A basic and widely agreed-upon generalization is that TR improves fluency and sometimes complexity but is less likely to benefit general accuracy, although it may enhance accuracy of specific target structures in the repeated task (see Ellis, 2019a; Sheppard & Ellis, 2018). In the present study, exact TR was used where learners repeated the same wiki writing task four times. It is underscored by scholars that repeating the same task multiple times is a valuable pedagogical technique rather than a mechanical practice. As Bygate (2018), for example, characterizes, “task repetition does not refer to the precise repetition of the language used. […] Rather what is repeated is a given configuration of purposes and a set of content information” (p. 1). Along the same lines, Nitta and Baba (2018) contend that “a task should not be considered as a tool to force learners to follow predicted steps but rather be seen as a pedagogical approach to creating an environment in which they can use and learn the L2 in their own autonomous ways” (p. 310).

These considerations are at the basis of Larsen-Freeman’s (2018) criticism of “the misleading impression that using the same task more than once will elicit the same response each time” (p. 323). Rather, repetition enables learners to “receive practice in adapting their language resources to mutable temporal and spatial contexts, and they construct their own learning paths” (p. 311).

A large number of studies have investigated TR the results of which generally highlight its trivial impacts on the language used in a new task which may be due to a lack of intervention to enhance learners’ FonF. As Ellis (2009a, 2019a) suggests, the maximum value of TR may only be achieved if it is combined with some type of pedagogic intervention between repeated task performances. A small but growing number of studies have attempted to investigate this. Most of these studies used corrective feedback between repeated task performances with some reporting improved complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) in oral (Sheppard, 2006) and written task performances (Khezrlou, 2020), others revealing enhanced target structure accuracy (Van de Guchte et  al., 2016), and yet others showing increased FonF and lexical variety with no impacts on complexity and fluency (Hawkes, 2012). In a study by Sheppard and Ellis (2018), the use of stimulated recall between repeated oral task performances did not induce FonF, yet it brought about durable gains in fluency, which Sheppard and Ellis relate to the nature of stimulated recall as an agent of meaning that directs attention to the content of the task. Corroborating this speculation, Khezrlou (2021a) concluded that the provision of explicit instruction between the same oral narrative tasks could effectively enhance explicit and delayed implicit knowledge development. Overall, then, these studies pinpoint the efficacy of more explicit than indirect, meaning-oriented methods of intervention between repeated task performances.

Research in TR has also recently begun to investigate the flexibilities and affordances offered by technology-enhanced environments in reinforcing effective task performance. For example, Kim et  al. (2020) found enhancements in learners’ written accuracy as a result of TR with synchronous feedback which nevertheless came at the expense of fluency. More positive results were obtained from Amiryousefi’s (2016) study demonstrating the effectiveness of repeating computer-mediated writing tasks in improving CAF, as well as Kartchava and Nassaji’s (2019) study revealing the significant efficacy of TR along with learners’ reflection regarding overall oral task performance. In sum, these studies examined TR using technology-enhanced collaborative tasks, yet no study as of yet has explored the potential of an asynchronous wiki environment in which learners are more prone to pay attention to language and formal issues when they edit or comment on their peers’ wiki writing (Wang,

2016). The immense productivity and the ever-growing popularity of wiki writing necessitates understanding whether repeated wiki writing can reinforce and consolidate the existing L2 knowledge or whether a form-focused intervention is needed to fortify its benefits in terms of knowledge development. In the current study, consciousness-raising was used as a pedagogic intervention.

# Consciousness-raising tasks

As the review of studies on TR with form-focused intervention depicts, there has been no study as of yet to explore the potential of consciousness-raising task as a between-task intervention option. Ellis (1994) defines CR task as “a pedagogic activity where the learners are provided with L2 data in some form and required to perform some operation on it, the purpose of which is to arrive at an explicit understanding of some linguistic properties of the target language” (p. 160). This signifies that although learners work out a grammatical rule, they are also engaged in meaning-focused communication. CR activities can be inductive or deductive. Whereas the former provides learners with the data to figure out the grammatical rule for themselves, the latter presents the rule which is then used for task performance (Ellis, 2002). There are a few studies that have explored the effects of CR tasks, some of which are reviewed here. In a number of early studies by Fotos (1993, 1994) and Fotos and Ellis (1991), CR proved as successful as teacher-fronted grammar instruction in leading to subsequent FonF compared to a control group that did not receive any grammar CR task. Interestingly, CR tasks have proved valuable not just in the enhancement of L2 learners’ explicit knowledge of target structures, but also non-targeted forms, as attested in Eckerth’s (2008) study, as well as in offering rich opportunities for learners’ language engagement (Svalberg & Askham, 2020). A limited number of studies conducted in the Iranian context also suggest the potential of CR in boosting knowledge of both syntactic structures (Fazlali & Shahini, 2019) and pragmatically appropriate language use (e.g., Hosseinpur & Bagheri Nevisi, 2020). Lastly, regarding the effectiveness of CR task types, Mohamed (2001) showed that inductive CR that encouraged rule discovery was as effective as the deductive CR that began with rule explanation. Mohamed (2004) also displayed that learners found both inductive and deductive CR tasks useful in imparting new knowledge about the language. To recap, as Ellis (2019b) underlines, CR tasks offer the means for developing explicit knowledge to help learners resolve their specific and persistent learning problems. In the present study, both the inductive and deductive CR tasks were used to compare their relative effectiveness in reinforcing learners’ noticing the gap in their interlanguage during their wiki writing tasks.

# Explicit and implicit knowledge

Explicit knowledge refers to the conscious and declarative knowledge of the L2 that individuals are aware of using and that they often can verbalize (Basturkmen, 2018). In contrast, implicit knowledge of the second language encompasses the intuitive and proceduralized knowledge that is normally recalled unconsciously in automatic and fluent language use and that cannot be verbalized (Basturkmen, 2018). As the ultimate purpose of instruction, a fluent and confident use of an L2 requires pedagogy to aim at developing implicit knowledge in addition to explicit knowledge (Ellis, 2002). Therefore, one of the most important issues in the field of instructed SLA is the investigation of how these L2 knowledge types develop.

Explicit and implicit L2 knowledge development in instructed learning contexts is the product of instructional conditions which has led to much controversy in the SLA literature. Although some scholars (e.g., Long, 2016) advocate delaying a FonF to task performance using corrective feedback, others (Skehan, 1998) underscore the role of pre-task preparation such as pre-task planning or the inclusion of attention to form before, during and after the task performance (e.g., Ellis, 2009a). The significant point here, as Li et  al. (2016) remark, is that although it is possible to ask learners to plunge immediately into task performance, there is a need to understand how learners can be prepared to carry out a task so as to maximize the benefits of task performance with respect to knowledge development. Theoretically, skill acquisition theory (DeKeyser, 2015) posits that learners need to have declarative knowledge, which can be learned through grammar instruction, proceduralized in subsequent task performances and then automatized through repeated practice. The potential of TR is relevant here since it provides meaningful practice opportunities which can facilitate the proceduralization of explicit knowledge. As already touched on, the only study to examine how the repetition of the same task with the provision of explicit grammar teaching results in explicit and implicit knowledge development is by Khezrlou (2021a) which found that the provision of explicit knowledge between the same oral narrative tasks significantly advanced learners’ both immediate and delayed explicit knowledge development and the development of delayed implicit knowledge. The present study extends this line further by examining whether learners’ writing practices in a technology-enhanced context where they benefit from collaborative meaning making, peer scaffolding and feedback, and knowledge building could bring about the explicit and implicit knowledge of the past-counterfactual conditional structure, or whether CR as one way to explicitly provide linguistic guidance was vital.

# Research questions

The present study was guided by the following research questions:

1. To what extent does repeated wiki-mediated collaborative writing with the intervention of inductive and deductive consciousness-raising tasks affect L2 learners’ explicit knowledge of the past-counterfactual conditional?   
2. To what extent does repeated wiki-mediated collaborative writing with the intervention of inductive and deductive consciousness-raising tasks affect L2 learners’ implicit knowledge of the past-counterfactual conditional?   
3. Do the language related episodes (LREs) during collaborative essay writing and the learning strategies during the consciousness-raising tasks vary across groups?

# Method

# Participants

Thirty-four pairs from three intact English as a foreign language (EFL) classes in a private language institute in Iran formed the initial sample for this study. They had been studying English at the upper-intermediate level based on their prerequisite courses as well as their score on the institute placement test which tests all four language skills including writing. Prior to the study, participants had studied writing as part of their courses; thus, they had already learned basic writing skills such as producing correct sentences, merging sentences into paragraphs and paragraphs into essays. Since collaborative writing constitutes a crucial part of the curriculum in this institute, participants were already familiar with the provision of peer feedback for revising and editing. Furthermore, the results of the Oxford Quick Placement Test (Allan, 2004) that was administered prior to the study showed that 60 learners fell into the B2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and eight learners who scored lower were excluded from the study. Participants’ demographic information is presented in Table 1.

The classes were assigned into one of the TR conditions: task repetition alone (TR, 12 pairs), task repetition with inductive consciousness-raising $( \mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ , 10 pairs), and task repetition with deductive consciousness-raising $( \mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ , 8 pairs). Participants had been learning English for at least 5 years starting from the junior high school. In an interview prior to the study, participants indicated that they were competent users of Web 2.0 technology, involving browsing the internet and using email and text chat. None of participants, nevertheless, had used a wiki before the study; thus, a brief training and practice on how to use it was presented to them.

# Linguistic form

The past-counterfactual conditional structure “which expresses the hypothetical outcome of an event that did not occur in the past” (Shintani, 2017, p. 7) (e.g., If I had not taken my friend’s advice, I would have regretted it later) was the target linguistic form in this study. The rationale behind opting for this form relates to its syntactic complexity since it includes two clauses (an if-clause and a main clause). Furthermore, it is also semantically challenging considering the wide variety of conditional clauses (Celce-Murcia & Larsen-Freeman, 1999). Since learners had at least five years of English learning experience, this structure was not new to them. However, it was expected that learners would have problems using the form accurately and the results of the pretests reported below supported this assumption.

# Materials

# The guided essay-writing task

A guided essay-writing task was adopted from Izumi et  al. (1999, see Appendix A and B). In this task, a writing topic was provided to the learners “which did not use, but called for, the past hypothetical conditional” (Izumi et  al., 1999, p. 429). Participants had to complete the essay on the specified topic (Scholarship Committee) within the determined day that was announced to them before. They could work on and submit their completed essay at any time from 8 am to $8 \mathrm { p m }$ that the language institute was open. This task targets the past-counterfactual conditional by asking learners to put themselves in the place of the committee members to award scholarships to students, which took place last year. Additionally, the fact that participants were asked to use sentences with “if…” directed them more towards the use of the target structure. Nonetheless, participants’ use of suggested sentences to write the essay does not turn this task into a sentence completion task because the main focus was on constructing a standard, cohesive essay. Besides, as a ‘pedagogic task’, although the essay-writing task lacks situational authenticity, it still has interactional authenticity by resulting in language use found in the world outside the classroom. It also incorporates learners personally since they are expected to tailor task content according to their personal ideas and experiences (see Ellis et  al., 2020).

Wiki pages hosted learners’ task performances. Learners worked in pairs to exchange opinions about the scholarship options to come up with a jointly written essay in an asynchronous mode. They were asked to exchange their ideas on content, organization and language with their partners during the writing and to work together to construct their essay on their wiki pages. In addition to being able to provide feedback to each other, learners could edit the content of the wiki collaboratively, share their knowledge and experiences around the topic and organize them into an essay. The activities that participants engaged in verify the genuinely collaborative nature of their writing. For instance, they avoided splitting up the task into subtasks and combining their work into a final wiki; rather, they reflected on the writing by commenting on and modifying their peer’s writing extensively (see below for a more detailed explanation), and they were able to complete their essay well in advance of the delivery time for the project. Figure 1 demonstrates a sample wiki page being constructed by learners and Appendix B presents a completed essay sample.

Learners were not allowed to engage in instant messaging and they exchanged ideas using the commenting facility in the wiki to prevent the intervening effects of other communicative modes and to obtain ordered information from one platform allowing tracing of contributions and generating statistics. Participants were not able to copy and paste their previous writing when repeating the same writing task since no tools such as Microsoft Word, notepad or instant messaging were installed on the computers during the treatment and learners were not allowed to use their phones in the lab. Furthermore, the logic behind the use of a wiki-mediated rather than a face-to-face writing task in the present study was twofold. Firstly, the asynchronous mode of wiki offered learners more time to think and exchange ideas without experiencing interruption. The re-readability of messages, in-situ revision facilities, and change-tracking mechanisms are features of wiki technology that make effective collaboration, feedback, and noticing opportunities more likely. Secondly, the use of wikis in EFL contexts has significant implications for writing pedagogy. Due to the insufficient classroom time, crowded classes and heavy workload, Iranian English teachers are mostly reluctant to teach writing (see Naghdipour, 2016). Besides, when they decide to focus on the writing skill, they lecture about how to write rather than getting learners engaged in writing itself (Naghdipour, 2016). Thus, choosing to use wiki to practice writing could be advantageous in extending the course objectives outside the classroom’s time and space.

Figure 1. S creenshot of a learner’s wiki page.

In this study, each group turned in one joint essay and there was no intervention from the researcher. A number of steps were taken to maintain collaboration in wiki task performances:

It was ensured that the wiki was easy to use for the participants, Participants received training in the use of the wiki along with ongoing technical support throughout the experiment,   
The advantages of improving the writing skill in English and the role of wiki technology in helping learners achieve their writing goals were described,   
Clear guidance was presented about what was expected of learners in terms of the quality of the final essay, and   
Participants were informed that their collaborations and the final essays were assessed.

The researcher emphasized to participants that their purpose was working with their partner to write the best possible essay and they were encouraged to collaborate jointly rather than divide the labor and cooperate. Thus, to ascertain that the task was fully collaborative, the wiki involved no pre-task labor division. Furthermore, the analysis of the wiki log files revealed that the average number of edits per page for the target structure was 64.33 which is considered to be very high and indicates that all pages underwent extensive revisions. Additionally, based on the collaborative framework by Mak and Coniam (2008), participants’ average number of collaborative activities during wiki writing were calculated. Learners added new ideas to contents of their pairs $( M = 5 9 . 3 6 )$ , elaborated on ideas of the pairs $( M = 4 8 . 9 8 )$ , reorganized ideas of the pairs $( M = 6 0 . 2 1 )$ ), and replaced and corrected ideas of the pairs $( M = 6 9 . 6 6 )$ . Overall, the means for these indicators of collaborative behavior confirm that participants actually engaged in wiki-mediated collaborative writing with their partners, providing fidelity of implementation. It needs to be mentioned that participants knew that they were going to write an essay in each session, yet they were not informed about repeated performances. Moreover, as in other exact TR studies (see Manchón, 2020), participants in this study rewrote the original task under the same circumstances. The number of repetitions in this study was selected based on Lambert et  al.’s (2017) suggestion that “up to five performances of a task may be required to prime, activate, and optimize students’ linguistic encoding processes on a task so that they can avoid breakdown and monitor their performance efficiently” (pp. 23–24). Moreover, it is postulated that limited repetition cycles may not be sufficient for converting explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge (DeKeyser, 2015).

# The consciousness-raising tasks

The CR tasks appeared at the post-task stage from which the experimental participants extrapolated the linguistic regularities pertinent to the past-counterfactual conditional structure that they failed to use or used incorrectly when they first performed the guided essay-writing task. The CR tasks included a deductive task and an inductive task (see Appendices C and D)—both performed synchronously with all participants in the wiki. The deductive task had two parts. In the first part, the rules and grammatical information were offered and in the second part, learners were asked to apply the given rules to complete a language activity. Members in pairs were asked to take turns to make sentences for each rule. Regarding the inductive task, although it entailed the same information, it did not provide the rules in their entirety to the learners. Rather, it asked the learners to figure out the rule by themselves from the presented information. The inductive CR in this study was similar to those in previous research (e.g., Mohamed, 2004; Nitta & Gardner, 2005) following the guideline that “the data provided must be adequate to enable the learners to discover the rule that governs the usage” of a target structure (Ellis, 2002, p. 172). Participants worked together only to work out the rule and apply it in their personalized sentences without any collaborative writing between them since production in CR was only limited to fostering the storage of rule as explicit knowledge (Ellis, 2002). The average time assigned for the deductive task performance was $8 . 5 8 \mathrm { m i n }$ and the inductive task group’s average time was $9 . 6 7 \mathrm { m i n }$ which were determined based on a pilot study with 18 learners from the same population but from different classes.

# Tests

# Oral production test (OPT)

An oral production test was used to measure learners’ implicit knowledge of the target form. This test necessitates free production making it an “ideal measure of implicit knowledge” (Ellis, 2009b, p. 28). Ellis (2005) argues that although spontaneous production tests constitute the best measures of implicit knowledge, “we cannot be sure that learners do not access at least some explicit knowledge, especially when the task involves writing” (p. 147). Writing is therefore more likely to make learners exercise more explicit monitoring and control over their production which would not be representative of their internalized linguistic knowledge—also acknowledged by DeKeyser (1995) and Ellis (2005). On these grounds, then, it is deemed that the OPT is characterized as more toward the procedural end of the declarative–procedural continuum. Previous studies have also used OPT to measure learners’ implicit knowledge of conditional structures (e.g., Schurz, 2018; Valeo, 2010, 2013). Following Ellis (2005), a principal component factor analysis of test scores using a two-factor solution to measure two distinct constructs of explicit and implicit knowledge was run. The two factors accounted for $6 9 \%$ of the total variance and OPT loaded at .76 on the implicit knowledge factor and .24 on explicit knowledge factor.

Participants were asked to individually read a story on screen twice and then orally reproduce the story (see Appendix E for a sample story). The text was seeded with six past-counterfactual conditional sentences. Thus, the text created contexts for multiple uses of the past-counterfactual conditional which were necessary for a comprehensive and successful retelling of the story. Based on the pilot study results, participants in the main study were given $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to read the story to avoid any memorization by the learners and five min were allowed at the most for the oral retelling of the story. This test was a computer-delivered test through the DMDX software (Forster & Forster, 2003) and participants’ oral narratives were audio-recorded. Learners were permitted to check the dictionary installed on the computer when they came across unknown words. They could use Microsoft Word to take notes during reading, yet they were required to close the program before retelling the story.

Three versions of this test with different stories but the same format were developed as the pretest, immediate and delayed posttests. The reliability of tests was calculated through the inter-rater agreement during the coding stage. A second rater scored $2 0 \%$ of the transcribed data randomly selected from each group. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the pre-, immediate, and delayed post-tests were .89, .90, and .92, respectively. The use of the conditional was scored using the scoring scheme by Shintani, Ellis and Suzuki (2014) as shown in Table 2.

# Untimed grammaticality judgment test (UGJT)

The untimed grammaticality judgment test was used to measure explicit knowledge. As Vafaee et  al. (2017) indicate, the GJT as a behavioral measure is closer to the explicit end of the continuum. Besides, the choice of UGJT was in line with a number of earlier studies (e.g., Ellis, $2 0 0 9 \mathrm { b }$ ; Hassanzadeh et al, 2019; Kamiya, 2015) in which explicit knowledge of the unreal conditionals was elicited using UGJT. The UGJT in the present study was a computerized test using DMDX which was piloted prior to the study to eliminate any procedural or mechanical problems in taking the test on screen. The test was also piloted on a linguist and two PhD learners in Iran and they all concurred on the appropriateness of items. Before the test, learners read the instruction on screen and were presented with four practice items to familiarize them with the format of the test. They were reminded that the test had no time limit. They were permitted to change their responses; however, after moving to a new item, they could not make any changes. The main test comprised 12 sentences for the target structure and six sentences for distracters. Half of the test items were grammatical and the other half were ungrammatical. Participants were asked to decide whether each sentence shown at the center of the computer screen was grammatical or not, report the certainty of their judgment and the criteria for their judgment, and lastly correct the structure if ungrammatical. The distracters included passive structure, relative clauses, and question tags. The internal consistency reliability indexes were estimated through Cronbach’s alpha for the pretest $\mathbf { \Phi } ( \alpha = . 9 3 )$ ), immediate posttest $( \alpha = . 9 5 )$ , and delayed posttest $\mathbf { \Phi } ( \alpha = \mathbf { \Phi } . 9 0 )$ .

When a participant considered a grammatical sentence ungrammatical and attempted to correct a structure other than the target structure, he/ she in fact had accepted the targeted part of the sentence and therefore scored a point. If an ungrammatical sentence was judged as ungrammatical but the error was not located correctly, no point was awarded. If the error was located correctly but not corrected, 1 point was given and if it was also corrected 1.5 was awarded.

# Procedure

This study was carried out during a period of five weeks in a language laboratory outside regular class time (see Figure 2). The experimental procedures included the pretest, treatment, and two posttests. In Week 1, the placement test and the pretests including the OPT and UGJT were administered. One week later, the treatment began. All participants used PBworks as the wiki website for carrying out the tasks (Figure 1).

It has three key features of creating pages, editing pages and commenting on pages/posts. Initially, the researcher created a trial wiki page where the learners could practice using the basic wiki functions. After the trial, learners were randomly assigned to pairs with two members. The researcher set up separate wikis for each pair and instructed them on how to use the wiki to complete their task. Learners’ interactions were recorded using Camtasia.

Session 4 in Week 2 took place three days after the learners had completed their first essay-writing task (i.e., the Scholarship task). In this session, prior to the repeated task enactment, learners received the CR tasks. Whereas the $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ learners received deductive CR tasks, the $\mathrm { T R + I C R }$ group was exposed to inductive CR, and the TR group received no CR. The CR tasks were uploaded by the researcher to the wiki page and members were asked to work together to complete the tasks. Immediately after they finished their CR activity, learners were invited to repeat the same essay-writing task. Participants repeated the same task two more times in Sessions five and six. Since the purpose of this study was to examine exact task repetition, the same guided essay-writing task was used throughout the experiment. The immediate posttest followed the next day, and in the final week, the delayed posttests were administered.

# Data analysis

The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 20. Alpha was set at .05 for all statistical tests. To answer the first two research questions, a repeated-measures ANCOVA was run, with group (TR, $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ , and $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R } )$ as between-subject factor, test (immediate posttest and delayed posttest) as within-subject factor, and the pretest as covariate. The assumption of normality was checked and confirmed through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test $\left( p > . 0 5 \right)$ . Next, the assumption of homogeneity of equal variances was examined through the Levene’s test of equality of error variance for both the UGJT $\left( p \ > \ . 0 5 \right)$ and OPT $\left( p \ > \ . 0 5 \right)$ . Finally, Maulchly’s test showed that the assumption of sphericity was not violated either in the UGJT, $\chi 2 ( 2 ) = 5 . 5 3$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = . 0 6 3 } \end{array}$ , or in the OPT, $\chi 2 ( 2 ) = 4 . 2 1$ , $p = . 1 2$ . Pair-wise post-hoc comparisons were undertaken using Tukey tests and within-group changes were examined through paired samples $t$ -tests. Between-group effect sizes were calculated as partial eta-squared $( \eta 2 )$ with values of .01, .06, and .14 showing small, moderate, and large effects, respectively (Cohen, 1988). The within-group comparisons also adhered to Cohen (1988) indicating a small effect at .2, medium effect at .5 and large effect at .8.

Lastly, to answer the third research question, the collaborative dialogues between the pairs on the wiki pages including History, Comment and Main Pages were analyzed. Adopting the theoretical framework by Swain and Lapkin (1998), collaborative dialogue in LREs referred to any part of a dialogue showing learners’ discussion over the problems related to the target structure or their self- and peer-corrections. A fellow applied linguist blind coded $2 0 \%$ of the randomly selected extracts. The inter-rater reliability between the researcher and the second coder was calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients for LREs ( $r$ $\begin{array} { r l } { \mathbf { \Psi } } & { { } = \mathbf { \Psi } . 9 3 \mathbf { \Psi } } \end{array}$ ) and strategy use $\left( r \ = \ . 9 7 \right)$ . All disagreements were resolved through discussion.

# Results

# Research question 1

The first research question asked about whether repeated wiki-based task performances with CR tasks could enhance explicit knowledge. Results of descriptive statistics are shown in Table 3.

The results of repeated measures ANCOVA revealed non-significant pre-test differences, $F ( 1 , \ 5 6 ) \ = \ . 0 2$ , $\textit { p } = \ . 8 7$ , $\eta 2 ~ = ~ . 0 0 0$ . There were, however, significant main effects for group, $F ( 2 , 5 6 ) = 3 7 . 2 8$ , $p = . 0 0 0 5$ , $\eta 2 = . 5 7$ , and test, $F ( 1 , 5 6 ) = . 8 . 9 6 .$ , $p = . 0 0 4$ , $\eta 2 = . 1 3$ . Also, a significant interaction between group and test emerged, $F ( 2 , 5 6 ) = 2 . 4 6$ , $\hbar =$ .0005, $\eta 2 = . 3 9$ . The post-hoc Tukey test revealed no statistically significant differences among any of the groups on the pretest $( \mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R - T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ $\mathit { \Pi } _ { p } = . 6 6$ , $d = . 2 8 )$ , $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ -TR $( p = . 4 2 , d = . 4 1 )$ , $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R } – \mathrm { T R }$ $( p = . 9 5$ , $d = . 0 8 )$ ). On the immediate posttest, however, both the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ $( p \ : = \ : . 0 0 0 5$ , [-5.48, −2.09], $d \mathrm { = } 1 . 7 8 )$ and $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ $( p = . 0 0 0 5$ , [-5.35, −1.73], $d = 1 . 4 9 ,$ ) demonstrated the largest effect sizes against the TR. However, the difference between the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ and $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ groups was not significant $\left( p \right. = \left. . 5 7 \right.$ , [-1.63, 2.13], $d = . 0 9 ,$ ). Nevertheless, on the delayed posttest, only the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R } ^ { \circ } s$ advantage over the TR was statistically significant $( p \ : = \ : . 0 0 0 5$ , [-4.49, −1.68], $d { = } 1 . 7 9 $ ). As for the $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ , it did not maintain its high performance on the delayed posttest as compared to the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ $\mathit { \Phi } _ { \mathcal { P } } ~ = ~ . 0 2 8$ , [.15, 3.26], $d$ $\ c = . 7 9 )$ and indicated no statistically significant difference with the TR condition $( p = . 0 7 8 $ , [-.12, 2.87], $d = . 6 7 \mathrm { \AA }$ .

Results of paired samples $t { \cdot }$ -test showed that the $\mathrm { T R + I C R }$ significantly improved from pretest to immediate posttest $( p = . 0 0 0 5$ , $9 5 \%$ CI [-6.51, $- 3 . 2 8 ]$ , $d = 2 . 3 3 )$ and delayed posttest $( p = . 0 0 0 5$ , [-4.95, −2.89], $d = 2 . 2 1$ ), with no significant differences between the immediate and delayed posttests ( $9 5 \%$ CI crossing zero) $( p = . 1 7 ;$ , [-.47, 2.42], $d = . 4 4 )$ . $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ also demonstrated a significant enhancement from pretest to immediate posttest $( p = . 0 0 0 5$ , [-5.71, −2.47], $d = 1 . 5 7 \AA$ ), yet this improvement could not be carried over to the delayed posttest $\left( p \right) = . 0 3 7$ , [.17, 4.72], $d =$ .91). Additionally, the delayed posttest was not different from the pretest $( p \ : = \ : . 0 7 5$ , [-3.49, .18], $d = . 7 0 )$ ). Lastly, no statistically significant differences appeared over the three tests for the control group (pretest-immediate posttest $( p = . 0 8 , d = . 2 1 )$ , pretest-delayed posttest $( p \ : = \ : . 6 7 , \ : d \ : = \ : . 0 6 )$ , immediate posttest-delayed posttest $\mathit { \Omega } ( p \ = \ . 4 3$ , $d \digamma =$ .16)), with effect sizes being marginal.

# Research question 2

The second research question investigated the effect of repeated wiki-mediated writing with or without CR on learners’ implicit knowledge development. Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics for the groups in three tests.

A repeated measures ANCOVA test revealed non-significant effects for pre-test, $F ( 1 , 5 6 ) = . 1 9$ , $p = . 8 2$ , $\eta 2 = . 0 0 7$ , and test, $F ( 1 , 5 6 ) = . 6 0 $ $p \ = \ . 4 4$ , $\eta 2 \ = \ . 0 1 1$ . Nevertheless, there was a significant group effect, $F ( 2 , \ 5 6 ) \ = \ 5 . 6 6 .$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 6$ , $\eta 2 = . 1 6$ , and group $\times$ test interaction effect, $F ( 2 , \ 5 6 ) \ = \ 6 . 8 9$ , $ { p } = \ . 0 0 9$ , $\eta 2 \ : = \ : . 1 9$ . Pair-wise comparisons using the Tukey test found no significant differences among any of the groups on the pretest $( \mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R - T R + D C R }$ $\left( p \right. = \ . 8 2$ , $d = . 2 0 )$ , $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R } – \mathrm { T R }$ $\left( \boldsymbol { p } ~ \right) =$ .94, $d = . 0 9 )$ ), $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R } -$ TR $\left( p = . 9 4 \right.$ , $d = . 1 0 )$ ). All had $9 5 \%$ CI crossing zero. Interestingly, however, the groups displayed different levels of effects on the posttests. On the immediate posttest, $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ significantly outperformed the TR $( p ~ = ~ . 0 4 7$ , $\left[ - 1 . 9 8 , \ - . 0 1 \right]$ , $d \ = \ . 7 3 )$ ). Although the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ was not found to be significantly different from the $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 5 9 \right.$ , [-.03, 2.15], $d = . 8 7 \AA$ ), the large effect size reflects advantages of $\mathrm { T R + I C R }$ over the $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ . Lastly, a non-significant difference was observed between the $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ and TR $\left( p \ = \ . 9 8 \right.$ , $d = . 0 4 )$ . Likewise, on the delayed posttest, only the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ fared better than the TR, with a significance level slightly below .05 $( p \ : = \ : . 0 4 9$ , [-1.94, −.003], $d$ $= . 6 9 )$ . On all other comparisons $( \mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R - T R + D C R }$ $( p = . 1 4 , d = . 6 2 )$ , $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ -TR $( p = . 9 5 , d = . 1 1 ) \rangle$ , $9 5 \%$ CI crossed zero. The within-group comparisons highlighted the significant improvement of $\mathrm { T R + I C R }$ from pretest to immediate posttest $( p = . 0 0 4$ , [-1.46, −.33], $d = . 6 5 )$ . $\mathrm { T R + I C R }$ maintained this significant gain on the delayed posttest $\ l ( p \ = \ . 5 4$ , $d =$ .10) which was itself significantly higher than the pretest performance $( p \ : = \ : . 0 4 4$ , [-1.47, −.02], $d = . 4 7 )$ . $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R } ^ { \circ } s$ pretest performance did not improve on the immediate posttest $( p = . 6 1 , d = . 1 3 )$ or the delayed posttest $( p = . 6 5 , d = . 0 8 )$ , with a non-significant difference also observed between immediate posttest and delayed posttest $\mathit { \Omega } ( p \ = \ . 8 3 $ , $d \ = \ . 0 5 )$ . Similarly, the TR group did not show any statistically significant gains from the pretest to immediate posttest $( p = . 4 1 , d = . 1 8 )$ , delayed posttest $( p = . 1 7$ , $d = . 2 9 ,$ ), or from the immediate to delayed posttest $\left( p \right. = \left. . 6 3 \right.$ , $d = . 0 9 ,$ ), with effect sizes being marginal to small.

# Research question 3

The results of analysis for LREs produced by participants during collaborative wiki writing are briefly overviewed here to reflect learners’ language negotiations. Overall, the raw numbers and percentage scores showed that the $\mathrm { T R + I C R }$ ( $N = 5 5 9$ , $\mathit { p } = 4 0 \mathit { i }$ ) produced more LREs than the $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ $\mathit { \Omega } ^ { \left( N = 4 7 3 \right. }$ , $P = 3 3$ ) and TR $N { = } 3 6 4$ , $p = 2 6 ,$ . In addition, although both the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ $N = 4 3 0$ , $p { = } 7 7 .$ ) and $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ $\mathrm { \Delta } N = 3 0 7$ , $\displaystyle P = 6 5$ ) produced more correctly resolved outcomes, the TR learners mostly produced neglected outcomes $\mathrm { \Delta } N = 1 5 6$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = 4 3 . } \end{array}$ ). TR group also produced more incorrectly resolved LREs $( N { = } 9 7$ , $p = 2 7$ ) and unresolved LREs $\mathrm { N } = 6 3$ , $\mathit { p } = 1 8 $ ) compared to both the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ ( $\left( N = 5 9 \right.$ , $\scriptstyle { p = 1 1 }$ ), $( N = 2 1$ , $p { = } 4$ ) and $\mathrm { T R + D C R }$ ( $( N { = } 6 1$ , $p = 1 3 $ ), $( N = 3 7$ , $p = 8 \mathrm { \AA }$ ) respectively. These findings indicate that the experimental group members who were made aware of the target structure through CR activities could better help each other in effectively finding and correcting their problems in their wiki joint texts. To shed better light on participants’ discussions over the target structure in their collaborative dialogues, a number of excerpts are provided in Table 5.

Moreover, the analysis of experimental groups’ interactions during the CR task completion showed that the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ engaged more in strategies requiring higher cognitive processes than the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ : analyzing the examples ( $( N = 8 0$ , $\mathit { p } = 1 3$ ), ( $\mathrm { \Delta } N = 5 0$ , $\displaystyle { p = 9 } \mathrm { , }$ )), comparing and contrasting each other’s statements ( $( N = 8 8$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = 1 4 . } \end{array}$ ), $( N = 6 5$ , $\displaystyle p = 1 2 )$ ), synthesizing ( $( N { = } 9 4$ , $p = 1 5$ ), $( N = 5 9$ , $p = 1 1 )$ ), and reasoning ( $( N = 1 0 6$ , $p = 1 7 .$ ) , $( N = 7 3$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = 1 3 . } \end{array}$ )). Furthermore, although the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ asked more questions than the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ ( $\left( N = 8 9 \right.$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = 1 4 . } \end{array}$ ) , ( $N = 6 1$ , $p = 1 1 )$ ), both groups corrected each other’s statements ( $( N = 1 1 3$ , $\mathit { p } = 1 8 \check { }$ ), $( N = 1 0 8$ , $p = 1 9 ,$ )). Finally, $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ exchanged more opinions about the rules than the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ ( $N = 1 3 9$ , $P = 2 5$ ) , $\left( N = 5 9 \right.$ , $p = 9 .$ )). These findings, then, lend support to those of statistical tests underscoring the superiority of $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ in bringing about more effective and durable L2 knowledge development.

# Discussion

The current study explored whether repeated wiki-mediated writing with the intervention of consciousness-raising could foster L2 learners’ explicit and implicit knowledge development. Regarding the explicit knowledge development, it was found that when participants in the TR group repeated the same wiki-mediated collaborative writing task, they did not necessarily enhance their knowledge of the past-counterfactual conditional structure. This finding is consistent with those of Kessler (2009) and Arnold et  al. (2009) which indicate that learners attend to meaning more than form in wiki-based and web-based collaborative writing tasks. Based on these arguments, tasks in these environments direct learners to focus on content with a goal of expressing meaning rather than focusing on the grammatical structures of the target language. Kessler (2009) suggests that more explicit practices might be needed to achieve greater FonF in wiki-based environments. Kessler’s recommendation was approved in the present study since the results demonstrated that the provision of inductive CR between repeated wiki performances was successful in leading to both immediate and delayed explicit knowledge gains. Although the deductive CR also resulted in immediate development, its effectiveness diminished on the delayed posttest. These results, then, largely lend credence to the findings of a number of previous studies (e.g., Park, 2008) that repetition of computer-supported collaborative writing does not enhance linguistic accuracy and that some type of intervention is needed between technology-enhanced repeated tasks (e.g., Kartchava & Nassaji, 2019; Kim et  al., 2020). This is because L2 learners have limited attentional resources and thus experience difficulty in attending to meaning and form simultaneously when performing a communicative task (Skehan, 1998). As tasks, by their very nature, emphasize meaning over form in communication, learners are more likely to attend to meaning to complete the task in their first attempt. Although subsequent performances of the same task help learners free up their attentional capacity and balance their attention (Bygate, 2001), it is now widely acknowledged that this is by itself insufficient—even with the versatilities offered by web-based technologies—if the ultimate goal is to promote language acquisition (Ellis, 2009a, 2019a; Khezrlou, 2019, 2021b, 2021c). In support of these claims, the results of LREs attested the significant role of CR in enabling learners to help each other effectively find and correct their problems in their wiki joint texts. Explicit knowledge gained from CR in this study, as Ellis (2009b) contends, was consciously used for “mediating performance and achieving self-control in linguistically demanding situations” (p. 13).

The results for the second research question suggest that the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ did relatively better than the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ and TR in improving their implicit knowledge, which endured for two weeks. Although the significance values for the between-group and within-group comparisons were close to the .05 criterion, the moderate and large effect sizes underscore the effectiveness of inductive CR compared to the other groups. This result bears out those of previous studies (e.g., Eckerth, 2008; Fotos, 1993, 1994; Mohamed, 2001), but contradicts the findings obtained by Fotos and Ellis (1991) showing that the effects of CR were less effective after two weeks. The comparatively better performance of inductive CR over deductive CR can be partly attributed to the test type. Learners in the inductive task are more required to attend to a linguistic structure than in the deductive task because they start the treatment with focused language observation (Schmidt’s (1990) noticing hypothesis). Language observation is also demanded by the GJT. As the Transfer of Appropriate Processing (Lightbown, 2007) posits, the correspondence between the cognitive processes in learning and the retrieval process promotes transfer. Hence, it seems that the cognitive process in the inductive condition and the GJT align well than that in the deductive condition and the test. In the OPT, learners are expected to attend to both form and meaning which is more complex in comparison to the GJT that solely emphasizes form. It is argued that systematic practice is a prerequisite for explicit knowledge to be gradually automatized (DeKeyser, 2015). In other words, explicit knowledge that is consciously stored in short term memory and is accessed through controlled processing needs to be strengthened and consolidated in long term memory through more exposure to language so that it can be accessed through automatic processing. Therefore, considering that learners in the current study engaged in three repeated performances of the same task to put their knowledge into practice, they could benefit from automatizing their explicit knowledge in spontaneous L2 use, thereby better results on the OPT.

Taking this line of thought further, a logical question is: Why did not the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ lead to the development of implicit knowledge after repeated performances? Compared to the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ participants who performed equally well on both the immediate and delayed UGJT, the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ learners’ explicit knowledge gains in the immediate test tailed off when they performed the delayed posttest. Thus, it seems possible that their explicit knowledge was not stable and robust enough to be automatized through practice and help them move from their rule-based system to memory-based system particularly when performing the OPTs under pressure in real time. Participants in the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ , however, achieved a solid explicit knowledge which served to help them carry on noticing the structure in the input, thereby facilitating its subsequent acquisition (Ellis,

2002). The results of the third research question also highlighted that in contrast to the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ in which participants read, memorized and applied the rules to their sentences, learners in the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ participated in rule-discovery, developed and tested hypotheses about the target structure, and checked with their partners about their interpretation of the rules. Indeed, grammar learning is effective when learners are encouraged to take in and change input, develop and test hypotheses, and draw conclusions according to the input and their hypotheses (Haight et  al., 2007). Additionally, constructivist theories of learning (Reagan & Osborn, 2002) call for approaches to teaching and learning entailing problem-solving and active engagement on the part of the learners rather than the learning of facts, rules, and strategies that are often associated with the deductive approach. In line with this theory, participants in the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ benefited from the inductive CR that required them to articulate and test their knowledge in order to solve problems followed by further clarification and refinement of their understanding of the linguistic form through discussion and rehearsal with peers in wiki writing.

Results also showed that the repeated collaborative wiki writing in the TR group without any CR was not sufficient to develop learners’ explicit knowledge not to mention its proceduralization. Furthermore, the results for the third research question verified that the $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { D C R }$ and $\mathrm { T R } + \mathrm { I C R }$ outperformed the TR regarding the overall LREs and particularly the correctly resolved ones, again pinpointing the limited impact of repeated wiki writing in inducing noticing and understanding. This finding re-confirms that wiki-based collaborative writing even when it is carried out repeatedly is limited on its own in boosting learners’ systematic attention to and understanding of the complex past-counterfactual structure during language production. This finding is parallel to those of Kessler (2009), Wheeler and Wheeler (2009) and Aydin and Yildiz (2014), indicating that learners collaborate to improve the content of their wiki writing and do not strive for perfect grammatical accuracy as long as errors do not impede meaning. This again underlines the role of a FonF strategy in drawing learners’ attention to form during wiki writing to reinforce their explicit, metalingual knowledge, which can then be gradually automatized through practice. Given that the present study is one of the first of its kind to explore the role of CR in learners’ implicit knowledge development, it provides evidence in support of the weak interface hypothesis (Ellis, 1994), acknowledging the possibility of explicit knowledge playing a role in the development of implicit knowledge. Accordingly, the learned knowledge can optimize the hypothesis testing process, thereby helping learners proceduralize rules more rapidly (Ellis, 2002). The findings of this study are also in favor of skill acquisition theory (DeKeyser, 2015), underscoring the essence of developing explicit knowledge before automatizing such knowledge through practice.

# Pedagogical implications

Pedagogically, this study lays the groundwork for teachers to incorporate wiki-mediated collaborative writing in their classes. The wiki is especially valuable in creating environments outside the classroom to practice collaborative writing as there are limited opportunities to develop the writing skill in EFL settings. Learners in this study could successfully collaborate with each other through scaffolding and feedback to develop joint essays. Thus, this study underscores the affordances of wiki as an alternative way to extend collaborative writing beyond the classroom through meaningful tasks. However, in order for learners to reap all potential benefits of task performance in the wiki environment, they need to be provided with FonF options. In other words, because learners may not strive for total accuracy during the wiki-based writing process, there is a need to direct their attention to the gaps between their knowledge and the target linguistic features. Thus, teachers are encouraged to use CR particularly in its inductive form between repeated wiki writing performances to help learners consolidate their L2 knowledge. Another issue pertains to the type of task that learners carry out through the wiki. This study revealed that the essay-writing task in the wiki was not sufficient by itself to direct learners’ attention to form, and thus there was a need for intervention to facilitate the form-meaning balance. Since in the wiki the task takes on a crucial role to advance collaboration among learners (Lee, 2010), teachers are recommended to complement meaning-oriented collaborative tasks with a FonF option.

# Conclusion

The present study shed some novel insights into the role that repeating wiki-mediated writing alone or with CR plays in enhancing L2 learners development of explicit and implicit knowledge. Results revealed that although the wiki engaged learners in collaborative writing endeavors, it could not effectively attract learners’ attention to form, resulting in unchanged explicit and implicit knowledge performances. In contrast, when the wiki entailed CR, learners’ attention to form and in turn explicit knowledge gains were significantly promoted, albeit only the inductive CR learners extended their enhanced attention to subsequent task performances and achieved durable explicit and slightly better implicit knowledge gains. This means that CR particularly if it demands cognitive processing as in the case of inductive CR is an effective intervention option to figure between repeated task performances. At the risk of sounding repetitive, one needs to consider that the significance values for the implicit knowledge were close to the .05 significance level and consequently there is a need for further replication studies to verify the results of this study particularly in terms of implicit knowledge development.

As with many studies, this study also has some limitations. Firstly, this study was conducted with upper-intermediate learners, targeting a complex linguistic structure. Future research may investigate whether the results of this research will be accomplished at lower levels of learning and with less complex linguistic structures. A further limitation concerns the use of a guided essay-writing task. This task is advantageous in directing learners towards the use of the past-counterfactual conditional along with the freedom of what learners are allowed to express. Nevertheless, different results may be achieved if more controlled tasks such as picture-description writing task and text-reconstruction task are employed. These task-related issues, therefore, obviously deserve further examination in future research. Additionally, although the OPT was selected due to its effectiveness in measuring implicit knowledge, its modality contrasted the treatment tasks. Hence, future studies are encouraged to replicate this study using a writing test such as a spontaneous timed writing. Finally, future qualitative studies are needed to examine learners’ wiki writing experiences and their engagement.

# The guided Essay-Writing task

# Scholarship committee—you decide!

Imagine that there had been a large amount of school funding designated last year to help part-time ESL students with tuition. A committee made up of students, teachers and administers decided who to give the scholarships to. Some of your classmates received enough money to pay for their whole tuition bill.

The committee members had different opinions about how the scholarship money should be distributed. These were some of their ideas:

Some people thought that the money should go to students who receive excellent recommendations from their teachers. They said, “The opinion of one teacher is enough.”   
Others considered grades to be the main factor, instead of financial need. These people said, “Academic potential is the main factor here. We have to give money to those we know will be successful students.”   
Some of the members felt that involvement in college activities should be considered primarily. They said, “Students who care about college take the time to get involved. They show community service qualities.”   
Various members of the committee suggested that students who work and study should be the only ones considered for the scholarship. They argued, “We have to appreciate the effort our part-time students make when they work all day and study all night. They deserve a break.”

# Scholarship Committee-You decide!

Scholarships are very important for the academic life of students at all levels. Last year, a committee decided on the allocation of scholarships to a number of students and some of my friends were lucky to receive this big payment I did not get the scholarship and became very upset. Perhaps, if I were on the committee last year, I could have make some different types of decisions.

Firstly, I strongly think that grades are not very important in making decisions. For example, our teachers always used tests in the class that were stressful and terrified us. So if teachers have used other things like helping us with the activities that we do in class, I would have more chances to learn and increase my scores and so get the scholarship. Our teacher also did not tell us that involvement in college activities have a positive effect on getting a scholarship. If the teachers had told us about these, we could have participated more in these activities. I also think that if I had been a committee member, I would have focused more on the students’ financial situation. Some students can’t continue their education because of not having enough money. For example, last year, I wanted to go to an English class but it was very expensive.. If the committee members had more information about students’ difficulties, they would have made more correct decisions. I also think that the student is important too. For example, one of my friends that got the scholarship last year is a very hardworking person. She lost it for two years but never gave up. If a student really wants it, she or he should work for it. And so if I was on the committee, I would have given the scholarship to my friend too. Also, if I had decided, I would select the students that had some disabilities. Studying is very difficult especially with no scholarship for disabled students. I can understand this better than any other person because I am hard of hearing and studying and working is very difficult especially with little financial support.

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that committee should have more information about students’ difficulties and be familiar with their situation to fairly give the scholarships. I would have done this. After all they change lives!

# Deductive CR task

Directions: check out your task cards for the information about the third conditional along with the correct and incorrect sentences showing the rule. Then, type your own sentence using the rule and take turns exchanging your sentence for each rule.

Task Cards (two to each member)

# Task card 1

Rule 1: A conditional sentence has two clauses. In the third conditional, the if clause is the imaginary situation in the past, and the main clause is what could have hap

pened (but didn’t happen) as a result. We make the third conditional with $\mathbf { i f } +$ past perfect, and modal verb (e.g., would, could, might) $^ +$ have $^ +$ past participle.

Examples

a. If I had known it was your birthday, I would have bought you a present (correct). b. If the taxi arrived on time, Jack would not miss the plane (incorrect).

Now make your own sentence using this rule.

# Task card 2

Rule 2: The two clauses can come in any order. When we write, we put a comma between the if clause and the main clause. You don’t use a comma when the main clause comes first.

Examples

a. If they had had any extra time, they would have visited the Tower of London (correct).   
b. They would have visited the Tower of London if they had had any extra time (correct).   
c. They would have visited the Tower of London, if they had had any extra time (incorrect).

Now make your own sentence using this rule.

# Task card 3

Rule 3: when you want to answer a third conditional question, you use the modal verb in short answers.

Examples

a. If you had needed help, would you have asked me? Yes, I would have. / No, I wouldn’t have (correct).   
b. If there had been any snow, would you have gone skiing? Yes, I had. / No, I hadn’t (incorrect).

Now make your own sentence using this rule.

# Task card 4

Rule 4: If is sometimes omitted in conditional unreal clauses. And, when this happens, the subject and verb are reordered.

Examples

a. Had she planted the flowers earlier, they would have been in bloom for the garden party last week (correct). b. I had completed school, I could have found a better job (incorrect).

Now make your own sentence using this rule.

# The lottery prize

James had been buying lottery tickets for 30 years. Last year, he was lucky enough to win the lottery prize. But he didn’t know how to spend his multimillion dollar lottery win. First, he wanted to invest in the stock market. But he didn’t have enough knowledge about Economy. If he had invested in stocks, he could have added even more money to his wealth. His next idea was to create a TV show. But he didn’t want many people to know him. If he had created a TV show, he would have become very famous. His children wanted most of the money. But he thought that it could distort them to find their own ways in life. If he had given most of his money to his children, he could have improved their lives. James then thought maybe he could buy a lot of luxury cars that he always dreamed of. But then he assumed that an expensive car parked along the street can be a much nicer target for theft. If he had bought several luxury cars, he might have made his car collection dream come true. His other idea was to travel to the Moon. But he was afraid of the space travel dangers. If he had travelled to the Moon, he might have had a memorable experience. Next he thought about starting a successful chain of restaurants. But he found that he couldn’t handle many different responsibilities of managing several restaurants. If he had started a chain of restaurants, he would have had much power and prestige. Finally, he decided to travel the world. Since winning the fortune, James has been to Egypt and Japan, and plans to visit Paris to celebrate his 50th birthday.
