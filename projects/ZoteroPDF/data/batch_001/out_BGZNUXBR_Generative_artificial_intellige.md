# Generative artifcial intelligence and ELT

Benjamin Luke Moorhouse

In this series, we explore technology-related themes and topics. The series aims to discuss and demystify what may be new areas for some readers and to consider their relevance for English language teachers.

Key words: generative artifcial intelligence (GenAI); ChatGPT; large language models (LLMs); conversational AI

Since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, there has been intense wonder, surprise, excitement, concern, and worry about the capabilities of generative artifcial intelligence (GenAI) tools and their rapid adoption into our personal and professional practices. Indeed, ChatGPT is the fastest-growing internet application in history. GenAI tools have begun to be integrated into almost all felds and disciplines including ELT (Jeon and Lee 2023; Crompton and Burke 2024). When well-prompted, these tools can efciently and (often) accurately perform many tasks commonly associated with human intelligence, including text generation, text summarization, translation, analysis, as well as image, code, audio, and video generation. However, releasing these tools has raised signifcant ethical issues that users should be aware of so they can use them critically (Moorhouse, Yeo, and Wan 2023). This article aims to provide an accessible introduction to GenAI tools and their application for ELT. It will defne GenAI and give an overview of the types of GenAI tools, consider the utility of GenAI for ELT purposes, and raise some issues language teachers should consider when integrating GenAI into ELT. It concludes by proposing some fundamental knowledge that ELT professionals need to interact with GenAI tools efectively.

GenAI is a type of artifcial intelligence (AI). In general, AI is a term used to describe computer systems that use algorithms to imitate human intellectual abilities and skills and are capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence (e.g. recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns) (Ali et al., 2024). Previous AI tools

utilized in ELT, such as chatbots and grammar checkers, were designed to perform preset tasks using predefned algorithms and rules (Lee et al., 2020). This meant they had narrow functionalities, but the input could predict the output.

GenAI is a term used to describe a large and complex variety of AI models and architecture that have been developed for diferent generative purposes. The most relevant to ELT are large language models (LLMs), of which generative pretraining transformers (GPTs) are a type. LLMs leverage deep-learning techniques and draw on large datasets, the internet, or customized knowledge bases to generate new and unexpected written content in response to varied and complex prompts (e.g. scenarios, images, instructions, questions) (Lim et al. 2023). Rather than deploying predefned rules, LLMs use the underlying patterns and relationships in the data to create statistically probable content (Nah et al. 2023)—for example, efectively predicting the next token or word in a sentence to create a coherent text. The ability of LLMs such as GPTs to ‘learn’ means they can be deployed in varied situations to engage in many natural language processing tasks without explicit instruction (Ali et al. 2024). However, the generative capability also means that the content they generate is not entirely predictable. Other models have been developed for handling visual and audio data (e.g. generative adversarial networks). GenAI tools work incredibly quickly—usually producing content in seconds.

Types of GenAI tools

It is difcult to classify GenAI tools neatly. This article focuses on three broad categories of GenAI tools most relevant to ELT: conversational AI; visual, audio, and video generators; and tools with embedded GenAI functions. It focuses on tools developed for general purposes and a broad user base, rather than specialized tools for professionals (e.g. medical diagnostic tools).

Conversational AI

Conversational AI is a term used to describe LLM types of GenAI tools. They are characterized by their interface, which simulates human-like conversations. This category of tools includes ChatGPT (developed by OpenAI), Gemini (developed by Google), and Claude (developed by Anthropic). All these models can respond to written text prompts, with some (e.g. GPT- $^ 4$ Turbo with vision, Gemini-Pro) able to accept multimodal inputs (text, images, and videos); however, they provide written text outputs. They can perform a wide range of human-like tasks. Below are some examples of tasks conversational AI can perform:

Content creation. These tools can create a vast array of human-like texts. Users can specify the genre, audience, topic, length, style, and any other desired features, and the tools will generate a text. This can include creative works such as poems, songs, and stories (Figure 1), as well as texts for personal and professional communication, such as e-mails, letters, or social media posts (Figure 2). It can also include lesson plans and learning/teaching materials.   
Conversation partner. These tools can engage in coherent ‘back-and-forth’ conversations on diferent topics and scenarios. They can assume roles (e.g. job interviewer, customer, friend) and respond within that role. Some tools can imitate famous historical people and respond in the spirit of their thoughts and mannerisms.

• (Multimodal) Text evaluation, summarization, and analysis. Users can input text, fles, images, and videos into conversational AI tools and ask them to evaluate, summarize, or analyse any aspect of them (Figure 3). For example, a user could input a story and evaluate its lexical complexity, and then suggest ways to improve the writing quality or increase its originality.   
• Translation and interpretation. LLMs can translate and interpret texts relatively accurately depending on the languages being translated. There are also specialist translation tools that are built on GenAI models (e.g. DeepL).

Conversational AIso can ‘remember’ and ‘recall’ previous prompts and maintain coherent conversations with the user. However, each model has a specifc ‘context window’ that limits how many tokens—the smallest building blocks, like part of a word, image, or video—the model can process at once. If an input text is too long, or the interaction a user has with the tool goes beyond the tool’s ‘context window’, then it will ‘forget some of the information it needs to complete the task. Some tools allow users to set the ‘temperature’ value the tool operates under. The temperature value determines the randomness or the creativity of the model’s responses.

Visual, audio, and video generators are designed to generate a specifc kind of content. Tools such as DALL-E, Stable Difusion, and Midjourney can create visual content, illustrations, and artwork. Other tools can be used to create audio texts—for example, Jukebox for generating music, or Speechfow can you create a tweet for an upcoming special issue of English language teaching journal that explores the use of generative Al in language teaching

AI for natural-sounding speech. While others can be used to generate or alter video content (e.g. Sora AI). Often the interface is built on an LLM, which means users can use natural language to request image, audio, or video content, and the tool then converts the user's prompt into more sophisticated instructions for the generator (which the user does not see).

Tools with   
embedded GenAI   
functions

GenAI models and functions are being increasingly embedded into many existing digital tools (e.g. Microsoft Copilot). These features are designed to increase the automation of the tools, therefore, enhancing productivity and the speed of task completion. Digital-game-based platforms and quiz platforms (e.g. Kahoot!, Mentimeter) have begun to embed GenAI functions to help users generate questions or to thematically analyse responses to open-ended questions automatically. It is likely that this technology will continue to be embedded in many existing tools.

In addition, the development of GenAI has spurred new tools for specifc purposes and groups of users, for example, CallAnnie (an AI conversational animated chatbot), Magicschool.ai (a GenAI platform for teachers), and DeepL (language translation).

# GenAI for ELT purposes

Given the generative capabilities of GenAI tools, there has been intense interest in how they can be utilized in ELT to assist language teaching and learning. Below several uses are proposed.

Knowledge resource and developer

ELT professionals can utilize GenAI tools as a knowledge resource and developer. LLMs can provide information on a wide range of topics, methodologies, and languages. Teachers can ask conversational AIs to

# Summary:

Benjamin Luke Moorhouse conducted a study on the impact of the CoviD-19 pandemic on the use of digital technologies by primary-school English-language teachers in Hong Kong. The pandemic forced a shift from in-person to online teaching for about nine months, leading to a significant change in the way teachers approached their teaching practices.

Data were collected from sixteen experienced teachers through in-depth interviews.The study found that the period of online teaching resulted in a greater and more integrated use of digital technologies in the classroom. Teachers adopted various technologies, such as learning management systems, digital noticeboards, interactive worksheets, quizzes, and presentation software, and continued to use these tools after returning to in-person teaching.

# Key Practical Implications for English Language Teachers:

1. Integration of Digital Tools: Teachers should consider incorporating digital technologies into their regular teaching practices to enhance student engagement and support learning.   
2. Professional Development: Ongoing professional development is important for teachers to become more comfortable and proficient with technology.   
3. Pedagogic Goals: Digital technologies should be used purposefully to address specific pedagogical goals and not just as an add-on to traditional teaching methods.   
4. Sustained Practice: The continued use of digital tools after a period of forced online teaching suggests that integrating technology can lead to sustained changes in teaching practices.   
5. Resource Sharing: Utilizing video conferencing and screen sharing tools can help teachers demonstrate and share teaching materials and student work effectively.   
6. Innovation and Adaptation: The pandemic has shown that teachers are capable of innovation and adaptation in challenging circumstances; this mindset can be leveraged for future teaching improvements.   
7. Student-Centric Tools: Teachers should focus on digital tools that support language learning outside of the classroom, such as games, book creation apps, and online libraries.   
8. Inclusivity and Accessibility: Ensure that the digital technologies used are accessible to all students, taking into account different learning needs and environments. Figure 3

Certainly In English,family member terms are quite straightforward with very few variations based on age or gender.In contrast, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese) has a complex system of kinship terms that convey not just the family relationship but also the relative age, gender, and lineage.

# English Family Terms

Mother: Refers to one's female parent.   
Father Refers to one's male parent.   
Brother Refers to a male sibling.   
Sister:Refers to a female sibling Grandmother Refers to the mother of one's parent.   
Grandfather Refers to the father of one's parent.   
Uncle: Refers to the brother of one's parent or the husband of one's aunt.   
Aunt Refers to the sister of one's parent or the wife of one's uncle.   
Cousin Refers to the children of one's aunt or uncle regardless of gender.

# Chinese Family Terms

In Chinese terms are much more specific,and there are distinct names for almost every family relationship.Here are some examples in Mandarin:

muqinMother.   
fuqinFather.   
gegeOlder brother.   
didiYounger brother.   
(jiejieOlder sister.   
\*meimei):Younger sister.   
zumuor nainaiPaternal grandmother.   
waizumuor laolaoMaternal grandmother.   
zufuor yeye:Paternal grandfather.   
waizufuor laoye)Maternal grandfather.   
(jiujiu:Mother's brother.   
shushu:Father's younger brother.   
boboFathers older brother.   
ayiMother's sister or father's sister-in-law (guguFather's sister.

Cousins are also distinguished by gender and whether they are on the mother's or father's side:

tang xiongdi)Male cousin on father's side.   
t\* tang jiemei)Female cousin on father's side.   
biao xiongdiMale cousin on mother's side.   
t\* biao jiemei)Female cousin on mother's side.

In Mandarin,prefixes like  da)meaning bigor J xiao)meaning littlecan be added to the terms for brother and sister to indicate relative age among siblings.

Figure 4 An example of how GPT-4 (via poe.com) can help language teachers research the diferences and similarities between languages (OpenAI. 2024).

# Examples:

daboEldest uncle on father's side.   
J (xiaoshuYoungest uncle on father's side.   
dajieEldest sister.   
xiaomeiYoungest sister.

This complexity reflects the importance of age hierarchy and lineage in Chinese culture, which is less emphasized in English-speaking cultures.The precise terms also facilitate clear communication about family relationships.

activities, designing cross-language learning materials, or providing translations of task instructions.

GenAI tools have great potential in supporting teachers’ preparation and planning (Crompton and Burke 2024). Teachers can use conversational AIs as ‘peers’ asking for teaching ideas, ‘bouncing ideas’ of them, and ‘talking’ through possible issues that might arise during implementation, etc. Their generative capabilities mean teachers can create tailor-made, authentic-like texts on diferent topic ideas, at diferent profciency levels, quickly and efciently. Their conversational ability means teachers can ‘work with’ conversational AIs to fne-tune the content they produce. This could include things such as reducing the lexical demands in a text or creating multiple texts on the same topic at diferent levels of complexity. LLMs can create virtually any language teaching and learning materials/activities and exercises, including reading comprehension questions for a text, cloze passages, multiple-choice quizzes, word banks for writing tasks, to name a few. Teachers can also use conversational AIs to generate lesson plans, or work with them to refne and improve them and eventually evaluate the lesson plan to check the accuracy of the content and whether the activities achieve the objectives.

Visual generators can be used to generate tailored images that illustrate specifc language items, or act as stimulation for discussion or writing tasks (Figure 5). Audio generators can be used to expose students to diferent English language varieties and support the teaching of listening and speaking.

GenAI tools have the capability to support personalized learning (Meniado 2023). As mentioned above, this can be from teachers being able to generate tailored materials and instructions. However, it can also be through the direct interaction of students with GenAI tools. In the language classroom, students can be tasked with interacting with a conversational AI either in written text, or orally (if a text-speech add-on is used), on specifc topics, in specifc roles, or to simulate specifc scenarios (Hwang and Chen 2023; Javier and Moorhouse 2023) (Figures 6 and 7). The GenAI tool can be prompted with information about the learner (e.g. age, profciency) to help it tailor its responses to the learner’s needs. Learners can also be taught ways to use LLMs to support their language learning in and out of the classroom. These tools are available $2 4 / 7$ so students can use them for language practice, explain language concepts and rules (in diferent languages), check the accuracy of their language production, and suggest study plans.

GenAI tools can support language assessment and feedback practices (Barrot 2023). Teachers can use conversational AIs to create items for language assessments and task rubrics as well as assignments for specifc learners. A lot of attention has been placed on LLMs’ abilities to give feedback to students’ productive work. Their ability to evaluate, summarize, and analyse fles and text means they can provide tailored feedback to students’ productive tasks. For example, teachers or students can input a piece of work into an LLM and ask it to give feedback on language, organization, or content related to the audience, purpose of the text or

![](img/1e1572f40524874ecd4a1902d30694f333b131b1e3dda403837b835f37f7668d.jpg)

Figure 5

Dall-E-3 that could be used to illustrate the uses of   
the past and present tense (OpenAI. 2024).

the task rubric. Some tools can also give feedback on verbal production, including fuency and accuracy (e.g. CallAnnie).

Importantly, many of the above suggestions are yet to be empirically tested. GenAI tools are clearly powerful and ofer the potential to support language teachers to achieve their pedagogic goals. However, they have limitations, can be used improperly, and have created ethical issues and real-world impacts that practitioners need to be aware of (Ali et al. 2024).

Issues to consider when integrating GenAI into ELT

First, GenAI tools can produce inaccurate content, often called hallucinations (Rudolph et al. 2023). The output can look plausible and convincing, but can be factually inaccurate. Diferent LLMs have varying degrees of hallucination with all LLMs providing disclaimers about the issue.

Second, GenAI tools can create biased content. As GenAI tools are trained on a large body of human data, which contains various kinds of bias (e.g. gender, political, cultural, and racial), then the output can refect these biases. Equally, some regions or groups may be underrepresented in the data sets, afecting the accuracy of the responses for these regions or groups (Javier and Moorhouse 2023).

Third, privacy issues have been raised about GenAI tools (Ali et al. 2024). Some LLMs collect and retain various kinds of user data, including prompts and interactions. It is important to check the security and privacy statements carefully.

Fourth, GenAI tools can be used improperly. The tools can be used to plagiarize and cheat. Students can submit work generated by GenAI tools as their own work. Indeed, the line between proper and improper use of GenAI is becoming blurred and will likely be dependent on the task assigned (Moorhouse, Yeo and Wan 2023). Outside of education, the improper use of GenAI poses a great risk to society as they can be used to spread misinformation, create deepfakes, and impersonate anyone.

Fifth, GenAI tools may have been trained on copyrighted data. Although most GenAI tools developers do not provide details of the content of their datasets, users of the tools often fnd responses that suggest that copyrighted data is within the tool’s dataset. For example, if you ask an LLM to create a story in the style of a particular author, it will lead you to postulate that it has access to the works of that author.

Sixth, GenAI tools could impact learner motivation. Because GenAI tools have the potential to make asynchronous and synchronous interlanguage communication easier, the need to learn English may be reduced. In addition, learners may not see the value of learning in formal language learning environments if they fnd GenAI tools equally efective in supporting their language learning. There is also a concern that learners may become overreliant on these tools and they therefore may become a hinderance to language learning.

Seventh, access to GenAI tools is not equal. Current GenAI tools are incredibly costly to develop and maintain. Although most developers have provided freeware options, these are usually less advanced models which can be limited by the number of tokens or prompts. Unlimited functionality and more advanced models are usually only available to paid users. This can create an AI divide in classrooms, and in the wider world.

Eighth, some GenAI tools have been found to lack creativity and originality in the content created (Ali et al. 2024). This could lead to similar content being created in response to similar prompts.

Ninth, GenAI tools have confused the idea of authorship. The generative capabilities of these tools mean they can produce texts or ‘author’ texts. However, as they are machines, they cannot be accountable for the texts they ‘author’. This means the current consensus is that the use of GenAI tools should be acknowledged, but they cannot be seen as ‘authors’. However, what uses of these tools should be acknowledged and what uses are unnecessary to declare, is still unclear.

Tenth, it has been suggested that GenAI tools have a negative impact on the environment (Crawford, 2024). Because of the computing power needed to develop, train, maintain, and operate these tools, they consume vast amounts of energy and fresh water.

Teachers must understand that GenAI is a tool, and they are responsible for checking the content created. It is important to formulate guidelines around the use of GenAI tools with emphasis placed on transparent and fair use (Hockly 2023). Teachers can communicate with their students about the risks posed by using GenAI tools, the limitations of the tools, the implications to their learning efectiveness and personal integrity if tools are used improperly, the importance of the learning process and academic struggle, and the wider impact GenAI could have on society and the world (Moorhouse, Yeo, and Wan 2023). In this way, teachers and students can use these tools more critically. Some of the limitations can be addressed through careful prompting and prompt refnement (See below).

Most GenAI tools have simple intuitive interfaces that are easy to use. However, to maximize the potential of the tools for ELT purposes, there are some essential skills and knowledge teachers should develop.

First, to use LLMs efectively, users need to be able to construct an efective prompt—a strategy called prompt engineering. There are now several prompt-engineering frameworks available to help users construct prompts (Cain, 2024). Most of these suggest that prompts should:

1) Be specifc: be as detailed as possible.   
2) Include context information: provide background information and include as much data as possible.   
3) Use simple language: write in clear and direct language.   
4) Give steps: breakdown complex tasks into steps.   
5) Involve an iterative and refnement processes: review responses from initial prompts and engage in ‘back-and-forth’ conversation until you get the desired content. (See Figure 8 for an example prompt and response.)

Second, users need to be able to compare and select GenAI tools based on their needs. For example, there are signifcant diferences between LLMs and their versions (e.g. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). They difer in terms of the ‘knowledge base cut-of’—when their training stopped; the context windows—how much they can remember during one period of interaction; the kinds of texts they can analyze (written, images, video); their speed of

Can you create a short story about an exciting day a ten-year-old boy had in Hong Kong.It should include an interesting plot and a clear climax.Please aim for the text to have a Flesch reading score of 80.0-70.0 suitable for a US 7th grade student.The story should be 200 words long.

Absolutely! Here's a short story crafted with those specifications in mind:

Ten-year-old Jack bolted through the bustling streets of Hong Kong, his heart racing.Today was no ordinary day; it was the day of the Great Dragon Boat Race,and his uncle was the star paddler.

Skyscrapers towered above, gleaming in the sun, as Jack weaved through the market. Aromas of dim sum and sweet egg tarts filled the air. But he couldnt stop; the race was starting soon.

He arrived breathless at the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront just as the boats lined up, their dragon heads and tails proudly displayed.The crowd's cheer was like a roaring wave.Jack spotted his uncle, who winked and waved.

The starting horn blared and the boats shot forward.Paddles sliced through the water in perfect rhythm.It was neck and neck, and Jack's uncle's boat was in the lead!

Suddenly a rival boat edged up, their paddles a blur.Jack's heart thumped.The finish line was in sight!

With one final, mighty heave, his uncle's team surged ahead and broke the ribbon.Victory! The crowd erupted,and Jack cheered loudest of all. It was an exhilarating end to an unforgettable day in Hong Kong.

The story should align with the target Flesch reading score, incorporating simple language and shorter sentences to ensure it's accessible to a 7th-grade student

Can you give the main character a Chinese name common in Hong Kong

response; and the number of parameters the tool considers when making a response—afecting the quality and speed of responses. Some LLMs have access to real-time information from the internet, while others do not. Language teachers should explore diferent models and even select diferent models depending on their purpose or task.

Third, some LLMs allow users to create customized bots that can be programmed using natural language to behave in a certain way or complete a specifc task. Language teachers could develop custom bots for their students to use, or to support their own professional work. For example, language teachers can create a bot to take on a specifc identity in a role play activity, give consistent feedback to students’ work using a specifed rubric, or act as a critical peer to give advice on teaching ideas or materials. Figures 9 and 10 show examples of a custom bot designed to provide information about a vocabulary item the user gave as an input.
