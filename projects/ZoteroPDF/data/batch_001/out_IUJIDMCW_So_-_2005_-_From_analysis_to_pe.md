# Abstract

This paper discusses the possibility of using newspaper genres and genre-based pedagogy to teach intermediate ESL learners to write school genres. Students’ typical writing problems reveal the inadequacy of the typical composition classroom instruction. Then two texts regarded as typical representations of the editorial and the school argumentative essay are analysed to demonstrate the different extents to which they resemble and differ from each other. It suggests newspaper genres can be used as resources to write school genres provided that students’ linguistic awareness is developed by using a series of metalinguistic activities. Students need to be made aware of text–function relationship, generic conventions, as well as overlaps and distinctions between genres. Transferability of genre knowledge from one genre to others is possible if students learn how to use metacognitive and discursive procedures in new situations and genres.

# 1. Introduction

In Hong Kong, students are expected to be exposed to a wide variety of genres, and as a result be able to produce a range of genres. According to English Language Syllabuses for Secondary Schools (Secondary 1–5, 1999, p. 14), “it is important that learners are introduced systematically to a good variety of text-types.” It also highlights the need to help learners to identify purpose and audience, to recognize the typical characteristics of beginnings and endings of a particular text type, and to develop and structure a text.

In reality, however, many students are only able to produce a limited range of text types and their work generally display problems as generalized by Fulwiler (2002, pp. 350–351), namely, learners’ attitude (motivation, interest), mechanical skills (spelling, punctuation), reasoning ability (thinking, logic), organizational skills, style (conventions appropriate to task and audience), and knowledge (something to write about). Such problems, except for learners’ attitude, are also highlighted in the Markers’ Reports of the English Subject in two public examinations, the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination and the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination for the Hong Kong Secondary 5 and Secondary 7 students.

Many candidates are unable to ‘organise their points logically’, ‘express ideas clearly and coherently’, ‘show an awareness of even the most basic of structures’ or ‘understand their audience and the reason for writing’ (HKCEE Examination Report, 2000, p. 118).

Candidates’ essays display ‘a limited range of arguments’ and their ‘unfamiliarity with social issues’. ‘.in a great many cases, they place too much emphasis on form and not enough on content in their essays, whether they provide arguments, discuss an issue, or simply tell a story.’ (HKALE Examination Report, 2000, p. 492)

The problems can be attributed mainly to two factors. First, inadequate emphasis is placed on genre learning. Regardless of the variety of genres expected to be learnt by secondary school students, the curriculum and the textbooks do not lend enough weight to genre teaching. Texts in course books are often simplified or adapted versions of authentic texts, as well as specially written texts with a view to covering particular grammar items and suiting students’ linguistic competence. Such texts do not represent the target genres, as simplified versions often compromise the generic integrity of the original texts. Moreover, learners are not sensitized to the generic conventions, the interactants, their purposes, why the texts are written as they are and how they work. In this regard, Bhatia (1997, p. 318) aptly points out “grammatical competence has traditionally been given the most important place” in the teaching of languages, but generic competence has always been overlooked.

Second, as Freedman (1995, p. 136) says, the typical composition classroom “rarely has any richly elaborated discursive context of the disciplinary classroom”. In Freedman’s (1995) view, the teacher’s first and foremost role is to establish the discursive and semiotic context by delivering lectures, designating reading, enabling discussion in seminars or groups, and indicating through a range of cues what should be imported and what needs to be excluded from the outside culture. Beaufort (1998) also regards subject matter knowledge as necessary for achieving success in writing tasks, apart from generic, rhetorical and writing process knowledge.

Therefore, what is required is a socioliterate classroom, as visualized by Johns (1997), that includes careful selection of authentic, complete and teachable texts, careful design of writing assignments that require different genres in different contexts and offer intertextual experiences. Street (1999) also points out that explicitness of genre instruction is important, or variety will become a problem rather than a resource. This suggests the necessity of a genre-based pedagogy that helps learners realize how schematic structure and linguistic features are related to social context and purpose. In addition, newspapers are good sources of authentic texts because of their accessibility, variety, standard language use and their coverage of different topics including current issues.

As part of a larger study which aims to develop a framework for a flexible genre-based writing curriculum for intermediate ESL learners, this paper is intended to show how explicit analysis of newspaper genres can be used to develop genre knowledge, which can be transferred to other genres, say in this case, school genres. Two texts seen as typical representations of these two genres will be analysed. One of them is an authentic editorial as an instance of a newspaper genre while the other is a school argumentative essay as an instance of a school genre. The two share in very broad terms a common communicative purpose, as both of them are argumentative in nature. The analysis is intended to establish typical generic characteristics in terms of communicative purposes, schematic structures and linguistic features of the newspaper genre and the student written argumentative essay to demonstrate the extent to which insights from these analyses can be utilized to teach relevant school genres in Hong Kong classrooms. The paper claims that linguistic awareness can facilitate the successful cycling of linguistic resources from some of the newspaper genres to school genres, such as argumentative essays. Such awareness, in the long run, can improve life-long skills that can help learners to cope with new situations and new genres.

# 2. Analytical framework

The analytical framework adopted here is a modified version of Tribble’s (2002) that includes contextual and linguistic analyses. To examine the relationship between language use and context of situation, the notion of metafunctions of language (Halliday & Hasan, 1989) is incorporated.

The relationship between the context of situation and the text is summarized in Table 1. Analysis also covers intertextuality as all texts incorporate voices of other discourses and genres (see Fairclough, 1995; Lemke, 1995). It means the analysis also involves studying the ways in which other genres and discourses are drawn upon—whether texts are explicitly cited, quoted, embedded and mixed or implicitly used in the text.

The analytical framework, which synthesizes Tribble’s framework with the notion of metafunctions of language and intertextuality, is shown in Table 2.

# 3. Genre analysis

The two texts selected for preliminary analysis are an editorial and an argumentative essay written by a Hong Kong Secondary 6 student. They are both on the same issue, Hong Kong parents’ loss of confidence in the school system.

Appendix A is an editorial that was published on September 5, 2001 in the South china Morning Post (SCMP), an English broadsheet in Hong Kong.

Appendix B is an argumentative essay written by a Secondary 6 student after a series of reading and metalinguistic activities in the writing classroom in December 2001 in response to the following instructions.

Many parents are sending their children to study overseas. As a committee member of your school’s Student Union, you want to put an article on this issue in the next newsletter. In the article, explain the rising trend of studying overseas, discuss the pros and cons of studying overseas and conclude with some advice for your schoolmates.

The analysis and comparison involve the following stages:

1. To analyse the generic conventions and structures of the texts and see how they are related to their contexts;   
2. To find out their overlaps and distinctions;   
3. To discuss what student writers can draw from the newspaper genres when doing a designated writing task, in terms of content, form and organization.

# 3.3. Comparison: overlaps and distinctions

Comparing the two instances of argumentative genre, the following points regarding their overlaps and differences in terms of language and schematic structure can be made. In general, the two texts indicate more overlaps than tensions as they share argumentation as their main rhetorical function and generic value (see Bhatia, 2002). Their similarities emerge from the following:

1. Purpose: both genres are used to express opinions, to evaluate and to make recommendations.

2. Schematic structure: both genres generally begin with the introduction of the issue in question, which is then followed by a sequence of arguments (which may include explanations, evaluations and recommendations interwoven with facts), and then ends with a conclusion which is normally the author’s recommended action or a restatement of the authors’ stand.   
3. Participants mostly being general: the issue is discussed generally, usually without focus on a particular individual. They mostly involve general participants, for example, ‘most local schools’, ‘students’ and ‘most parents’.   
4. Non-attributed opinions interwoven with facts: unlike news stories where information, particularly evaluations and views, is usually attributed to sources to maintain their objectivity and create a sense of factuality, both the editorial and the school argumentative essay can be explicitly subjective as their purpose is to argue. Their views and opinions are their own, not others, so it is important to retain authorship rather than give principalship to others. However, to make their arguments convincing and persuasive, it is necessary to back them up with facts.   
5. Dominance of interpersonal meaning language: both these genres have a large number of linguistic features for realizing interpersonal meanings, such as evaluative lexis, modality, involvement strategies like the use of ‘we’ and rhetorical questions.   
6. Connectives for reasoning: as the purpose of the two genres is to argue, connectives for reasoning are essential to reveal the causal relationship between clauses, sentences or large stretches of the texts.

However, there are some differences between them as they are two genres situated in different contexts. In terms of Tenor, an editorial is supposed to be written by the editor for the general readers and so it has a much higher degree of formality. A school argumentative essay, on the other hand, is written by a student to a simulated audience such as schoolmates (though in reality the teacher), so it is more personal and involves the use of personal mental clauses, such as ‘I think’ and ‘I suppose’. Even when ‘we’ is used, as in the editorial as an involvement strategy, it does not refer to the reader and the writer, but the general public.

The overlaps and distinctions between the two genre texts are summarized in Fig. 1.

# 4. Discussion and implications

The above comparison reveals that the editorial overlaps quite significantly with the student written argumentative essay in terms of their communicative purpose, schematic structure and a number of lexico-grammatical features. It suggests the benefit of using the editorial to help students write argumentative essays, as there are so many similarities. The reading of an editorial on a relevant topic can lead to transfer of not only content and lexis, but also structure and linguistic features such as modality, connectives for reasoning and involvement strategies.

The advantages of modelling have been revealed by some researchers (Charney & Carlson, 1995; Smargorinsky, 1992; Stolarek, 1994). There have been genre-based approaches making use of ‘parallel texts’, texts of the same genre, which show learners what can be ‘borrowed’, such as the approach suggested by Flowerdew (1993) and Martin/Rothery curriculum cycle (Cope & Kalantzis, 1993; Martin, 1999). Effectiveness of genre-based approaches have been reported (see Cope, Kalantzis, Kress, & Martin, 1993; Knapp, 2002).

![](img/2e03b9e275c6ad642b1fe07dea8b4010616a3d4099fb4981534ef290e8ef7e97.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Overlaps and distinctions between editorial and school argumentative essay.

Despite the fact that the editorial and the school argumentative essay are embedded in two very different situational contexts, one as part of the newspaper world, and the other embedded in the classroom, they share a number of characteristics, which can provide a basis to facilitate an appropriate transfer of genre from one context to the other. In this case, an editorial can provide utilizable content knowledge, on the one hand, and schematic structure, on the other. In addition, a writing curriculum can also develop students’ sensitivity to the use of lexico-grammatical features, some of which they can utilize while other they should avoid.

Since genre knowledge seems to be a key contributor to the development of writing ability, one of the main recommendations of the paper is to use genre analysis as a tool in writing instruction. Although in language teaching, especially in writing activities, analytical skills have a great potential, they have rarely been exploited to make learners aware of the writing conventions, which include content, lexico-grammar, and genre structuring. One may argue that the analytical framework used here involves a number of abstract levels and technical terms, which may not be accessible to intermediate ESL learners. However, analysis need not be detailed or technical. It is always possible to begin with situating a text in a typical context of situation and activating learners’ schemata in terms of both content and form. Similarly, placing the text in a typical communicative context and then referring to stages to achieve this communicative purpose through a set of stages can be least technical. Likewise, context of situation can be discussed in very general everyday terms, without use of such terms as field, mode and tenor. The important point is that learners should be able to relate content, language and context in a meaningful way to determine how one relates to the other. Once the learner understands this, the choice of lexico-grammar becomes easy and meaningful. Topic-related and evaluative lexis, modality, connectives all assume real meanings for the learner. What one needs to remember, however, is that depth of analysis needs to be adjusted to the needs and competence of the learner.

Another important implication of this genre-based relationship between real-life genres and school genres is that it allows the learner naturally to take note of intertextual and interdiscursive experiences. As a matter of fact, mingling of texts and genres in real life discursive activities is a common thing, though it is rarely taken up seriously in school genres. Intertextual writing tasks, which require students to draw upon other texts or genres, are becoming increasingly common as part of school and public examinations nowadays. In Hong Kong, for example, in Practical Skills for Work and Study of the HKALE Examination, students need to complete writing tasks based on a number of texts of various genres in a data file. Without adequate genre knowledge, many candidates usually copy chunks of information regardless of the need to adapt most of the data they use, To enable students to cope with a wide range of genres in today’s world, it is important to help them acquire not only the knowledge of the rhetorical context, audience, generic conventions, as well as generic overlaps and distinctions, but more importantly also the knowledge and understanding of intertextuality and interdiscursivity in genre writing.

Given the provision of adequate metacognitve and discursive activities to facilitate development of linguistic awareness, other newspaper genres, in addition to the editorial, can be used to create a discursive context in the writing classroom. News stories, for instance, are often read by secondary school students for keeping abreast of current issues and increasing their range of vocabulary. News stories can be analysed and compared with other genres, and the linguistic data in terms of content and lexis can be transferred to students’ writing of different genres. For instance, the content of a news story can possibly be cycled into the writing of a story, a play script, a friendly letter, an argumentative essay or a letter to the editor. It, however, necessitates an awareness of text–function relationship, why a text is written the way it is, how language use is related to communicative purpose, and other contextual factors such as field, mode, and tenor, as well as generic overlaps and distinctions. Newspaper genres can be used to create a rich discursive context for the writing lesson; however, if students are not sensitized adequately to their generic conventions, these newspaper genres can create more problems than benefits.

In other words, a genre-based pedagogy is requisite if we want to provide our students with reading material of other genres, say newspaper genres, for creating a rich discursive context for the writing lesson rather than just the target genre that students eventually need to write. The genre-based pedagogy can be synthesized with a process writing approach, as suggested by Badger and White (2000) and Coe (1994), to incorporate a sequence of metalinguistic activities in the following way.

1. Newspaper articles on a specific theme, for instance ‘suicide’, can be provided as reading material to establish a discursive context. Students can be asked to read and then discuss the articles based on the teacher’s guidelines so as to strengthen their understanding of the issue, to provoke thoughts and to provide a chance for sharing opinions.

2. Students can then be provided with a selection of metalanguage and an analytical framework, with which they conduct contextual and textual analysis of the texts so that they can get to know how the schematic structure and lexico-grammatical choices are related to purpose and context.   
3. Students then discuss how they can draw upon the given genre texts for completing a given writing task. They should decide whether they can borrow the schematic structure and some linguistic resources such as lexis and rhetorical strategies, with which they can express their own ideas. This is not intended to make students produce uniform work as they should have different ideas. This is a stage to discuss possible variations as well.   
4. Students produce their own texts based on the task demands and the given situation.   
5. Students consult their peers and teachers for feedback, based on which they revise their writing.   
6. Students’ writing is assessed and then returned to students, who then edit and rewrite it according to the teacher’s written feedback, In order to raise students’ generic awareness and grammatical competence, their common errors can be discussed, and good writing can be shared.

Drawing on Feez and Joyce’s Teaching and Learning Cycle cited in Feez (2002), Fig. 2 represents the sequence of activities discussed above.

This paper has identified two important potential contributors to school curriculum writing activities: establishing a rich discursive context, and using a genre-based pedagogy to offer intertextual experiences.

![](img/29fcaee732ed9e0ddd12bbd0f852566e035c283f7bfc97c1bcb0d6b53c855430.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Genre instruction cycle (Feez, 2002).

The purpose of teaching is not just to help students to cope with various task demands in school, but also to prepare them for other real world genres they come across outside school and to develop life-long skills to cope with various unfamiliar genres in new situations, and new genres in this fast developing world of information. A genre-based approach can help achieve this purpose and facilitate transfer of genre knowledge to new genres and new situations, Bazerman (1997) rightly points out, “if we provide some analytical vocabulary to reflect on how genres relate to the dynamics of situations, they will be able to observe and think about new situations with some sophistication and strategic awareness.” Similarly, Beaufort (1998) thinks that to facilitate transfer of learning, it is necessary to allow students to see how abstract concepts such as rhetorical context can be applied across a variety of writing situations and to cultivate metacognitive thinking to increase opportunities for high road transfer from one situation to the next. Fairclough (1995) also seems to echo a similar concern when he claims that awareness affects language capabilities.

Linguistic awareness can be more effectively developed with purposeful language practice and critical analysis of genres. All in all, transferability of genre knowledge is only possible with such linguistic awareness that can be effectively developed through explicit genre instruction.

# Appendix A. Text 1: crisis of confidence

A Chinese University survey has confirmed what many have long noticed—middleclass parents have lost confidence in the SAR’s school system and would rather send their children overseas or to local international schools.

What has so far escaped serious attention is the researchers’ warning that if that trend continues, local schools will become the ‘second best’ option for those who can afford to put their children in alternative systems, and that will be socially divisive.

Before 1978, only $30 \%$ of primary students could go on to receive a subsidized secondary education, and they had to take a competitive examination and fight for a place. The system was ruthless, but selection was completely based on academic merit. Regardless of their backgrounds, gifted children from poor families could get into the best schools and study alongside those who were equally bright but might have richer parents. Schools were a melting pot then.

To a lesser extent, they still are today. But the sad fact is that many parents, who have risen from rags to riches because they were fortunate enough to have been educated at socalled elite schools, are finding that their alma mater is no longer providing a quality education for their children. They are pulling their children out because, with a few exceptions, the schools have failed to change with the times to impart knowledge in new ways and to equip students with skills needed in the Modern world. In time, that must diminish the integrating function of the top local schools.

The international schools may caution that they are not suitable for all local children. After all, they are not designed for second-language learners, and there is a vast difference in the needs of native and non-native speaking children. Nor is going to an overseas boarding school a suitable option for all. For some, it works; for others, living away from their parents when they are so young can be emotionally devastating.

Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa is aware of the urgent need to reform our schools, a problem left over from the colonial administration. Unfortunately, while the lofty ideals of his reform blueprint raise little objection, it will take years before the changes bear fruit. And the clumsy way in which his Government managed the mother-tongue education policy—a main source of complaints among the middle class—and the benchmark test for English teachers have not helped to inspire confidence in the reforms.

But reform we must, as the SAR’s future rides on its success. For the long-term prosperity of Hong Kong, everyone must put aside his or her vested interest to ensure the majority of children whose only option is to study at local schools get a quality education.

# Appendix B. Text 2

Many parents are sending their children to study overseas today and this tendency is growing. Why? I suppose that the students and their parents have lost confidence in the education system.

Firstly, the education system is too exam-oriented. Most local schools are bound by the syllabuses of HKCEE and HKALE, so most schools mainly focus on exam preparation. Students bury their heads in a pile of books and exercises in order to get good exam results. Moreover, teachers are spoon-feeding and cramming them with the content of books. They are just like empty containers slowly filled with selected knowledge. Memorization is emphasized but not critical and independent thinking.

Secondly, most of the parents do not like the mother-tongue education policy implemented after 1997. Now most of the secondary schools are CMI schools (schools that use Chinese as the medium of instruction). However, most parents think that English is very useful nowadays and if their children cannot be admitted in an EMI school, they will consider sending their children overseas.

Thirdly, the education policies, in many people’s view, are changing too fast. Parents, students as well as teachers find it difficult to cope. The education system seems chaotic. For instance, the change in the banding system from classifying Primary 6 students in 5 bands to just 3 makes the Form 1 intake of each secondary school more diverse in terms of standards. The implementation of the mother-tongue education policy has also drawn a lot of criticisms. At first, secondary schools were told to use Chinese to teach and then some schools were permitted to exempt from this. Then after a year or two, the Education Department said it was investigating the feasibility of teaching some subjects in Chinese while others in English.

Studying overseas has both pros and cons. Studying overseas can make children more independent and mature since they need to take care of themselves. Moreover, it can widen their horizons. They can know more about a foreign culture, such as their lifestyle. They can meet more people and such experience will be valuable for life. If they study in an English-speaking country, such as the US, they can improve their English standard.

On the other hand, studying overseas has some disadvantages. When children are away from their parents and friends, it can be emotionally devastating. It may be difficult for them to adapt to a new environment especially if their adaptability is weak. If their English is not very good, then they may have lots of communication problems. All these problems take time to solve.

Finally, I would like to give advice to those who want to study overseas. Before making a decision, you must consider it carefully. You need to know whether you want to study overseas and whether you have confidence in coping with all the foreseen problems you will come across at least when you first get to that foreign country. Then you need to look for information about the school you intend to study at, for example, its location and school fee. However, your learning attitude is the most important factor for success. Regardless of where you study, you must work hard enough.
