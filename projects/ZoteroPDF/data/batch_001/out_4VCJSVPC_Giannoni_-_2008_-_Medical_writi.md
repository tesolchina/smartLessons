# Abstract

English has gradually become the lingua franca of medical publications and conferences across Europe, with scholars from ‘smaller’ languages opting for English because of the greater scientific impact and prestige associated with a wide international audience; at the same time, however, this transition has disrupted well-established textual traditions, hybridising local written and spoken practices. The case of Italian medical journals is especially enlightening, as shown by entries in PubMed (U.S. National Library of Medicine) over the last two decades. The rhetorical implications of this shift are investigated in a sample of medical editorials consisting of Italian texts, NNS English texts from Italian journals, and NS English texts from Anglo-American journals. Cross-linguistic variation in the genre appears to be particularly noticeable in the wording of opening and closing sentences and in the frequency/referent of first-person markers. The analysis of such features suggests that insecurity and decontextualisation are experienced by Italian editors writing in English and that the structural demands placed on NS English texts are more stringent than those placed on their NNS and Italian counterparts. In a way, NNS editorials may thus be seen as intertexts mediating between two different NS models.

# 1. Introduction

The advancement of medical knowledge would be impossible today without scientific networking across national/ cultural boundaries and, accordingly, researchers in the field constitute one of most globalised communities of practice in academia. As a result, English has gradually established itself as the preferred language of medical communication across Europe (cf. Maher, 1986; Taavitsainen & Pahta, 2003; Tardy, 2004), with scholars from ‘smaller’ languages opting for it because of the prestige and impact associated with an international readership.

# 1.1. The role of medical editorials

Unlike other fields of learning, medical science attributes a special function to editorial content, as shown by the frequent presence of several such articles (each dealing with a separate issue) within the same issue of a journal.

Medical editorials (hence MEDs) perform no less than three functions: they act as expert introductions to relevant topics dealt with in the journal; they offer critical commentary on events of interest to the medical community; and finally they provide guidelines for practitioners, helping them to recognise best practices and suitable references in the literature. The last function is reflected in Salager-Meyer’s (2002, p. 73) classification of MEDs as ‘‘debatefocused essay-like metatexts.’’

Though not directly mentioned by Swales (2004) in his latest taxonomy of academic genres, editorials appear to belong in the ‘Shorter Communication’ category, among published research communications e although their length is in fact extremely flexible. The main difference between editorials and other academic genres is that the former contribute to knowledge validation rather than knowledge creation and for this reason are not counted as ‘publications.’

The impact of MEDs can hardly be understated, as they bridge the widening gap between researcher and practitioner, enabling authoritative experts to monitor the medical community’s line of thought and behaviour (Carnet & Magnet, 2006; Giannoni, 2008). The highly asymmetric writer/audience relationship encoded in this genre, combined with its frequent engagement in controversial aspects of medical practice, accounts for the fact that e compared to research papers and clinical case notes e MEDs are ‘‘the freest in form, the most heavily attitudinally marked, and syntactically and linguistically the most complex’’ text found in medical journals (Adams Smith, 1984, p. 32).

The special prominence of editorials in medical journals and science makes them an interesting choice for studying discoursal variation across the centre-periphery continuum, viewed here in linguistic terms rather than as a socioeconomic criterion separating high-income, technologically advanced countries from their counterparts (as in Canagarajah, 2002). The limited relative power of Italian as an international language of science means that its discourse community constitutes a ‘smaller culture’ (as defined by Holliday, 1999) than that associated with English. A similar condition is experienced by scholars in Spain, Portugal, Hungary and Slovakia, who are part of the centre from an economic standpoint but are disadvantaged and therefore peripheral linguistically speaking (Lillis & Curry, 2006).

Considering the historical vicissitudes of Italy and its accession to full independence only in the latter half of the 19th century, it could also be argued that Italian scientists are heirs to a peripherality that reaches at least back to the Enlightenment (Gavroglu, 1999). The shift to English is also an opportunity to redress the balance by putting authors in this country on an equal footing with other NNS authors in Europe.

# 1.2. Italian scholars and English-medium publications

Despite underfunding and a highly centralised academic bureaucracy (Ugolini & Garrucciu, 2005), Italian researchers have risen to prominence in many disciplinary fields, with internal medicine, space research, physics and haematology at the forefront: according to a recent study (Breno, 2006) they rank second in the world for productivity. The scientific impact of such research, however, remains oddly low and places Italian authors only in 16th place in terms of citations of their work. Ugolini & Casilli (2003) estimate at somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 the number of scientific/technological journals published in Italy, only 73 of which (all English-medium serials) were indexed in the 2000 edition of Journal Citation Reports; with one exception, the most cited titles in this list are all medical journals.

It is a well-known fact that the pervasiveness of English as a lingua franca of research does not affect all disciplinary areas to the same extent. This applies also to the Italian scientific community, as indicated in a recent report commissioned by the Ministry of University and Research (Cuccurullo, 2007). Its findings, summarised in the diagram below, show the language(s) of choice of publications submitted to CIVR (the Italian Research Review Body) for evaluation. Medicine ranks fifth in the list for its almost total reliance on English rather than Italian and is preceded only by mathematics, food quality, chemistry and nano-technology. Italian holds its ground in the social sciences and humanities (Fig. 1).

# 2. Language trends in medical literature

In order to assess the linguistic status of Italian scholars in relation to the medical literature, it is helpful to know how far the national language is being replaced by English and whether similar trends are affecting other European languages. For this purpose, bibliographic evidence was collected from PubMed (2006), the most comprehensive and authoritative database consulted by medical researchers and practitioners. This online service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine covers over 16 million citations in 5,000 biomedical journals from the US and 80 other countries (wherever English abstracts are available) since the 1950s. The total number of entries published in English and other languages was therefore extracted for each year between 1986 and 2005 and plotted in Fig. 2.

Fig. 1. Language of publication of Italian research by discipline (Cuccurullo, 2007, p. 6).

While the overall number of medical publications more than doubled over the twenty-year period (from 340,105 to 683,578), those in other languages decreased from 76,752 to 65,363. This means that the proportion of non-English publications is now only $10 \%$ of the total, compared to $23 \%$ in 1986. It is also clear from the graph that such figures are the result of a steady trend over time.

PubMed was then probed for parallel variations in four European languages (Italian, French, Spanish and German) during the same period. The results show a dramatic decline of their overall share, which fell to $3 . 8 \%$ of all PubMed entries in 2005 from $9 . 9 \%$ in 1986. Turning to the number of entries for each language (Fig. 3), it is worth noting that while Spanish saw a slight increase $( + 1 5 \% )$ in publications, the figure is down $12 \%$ for French, $40 \%$ for German and

$60 \%$ for Italian. As this dramatic erosion is not a result of decreasing productivity on the part of non-Anglophone medical researchers, the phenomenon graphically illustrates their gradual shift to English over the last two decades.

The PubMed search options do not allow users to identify contributions by genre, so it was not possible to measure what proportion of these medical publications are editorials. Information of this sort can be obtained from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE, 2006), which covers 5,900 journals in 150 scientific disciplines. A search for ‘editorial matter’ originating from Italy during each year since 1990 (the earliest recorded date available), yielded the results summarised in Table 1. The proportion of editorials in Italian was $5 . 9 \%$ in 1990 but has now fallen to $0 . 2 \%$ , while English has become the language of no less than $9 9 . 7 \%$ of all cited publications from Italy.

In order to be ‘noticed’ and achieve international recognition, Italian biomedical researchers and scholars in other experimental/applied sciences employ English almost overwhelmingly, while the national language is reserved for publications of a more local nature that do not appeal to the concerns of a global audience. Despite the omission of publications that do not even include an English abstract (and cannot therefore be submitted for indexing), these figures suggest that one day Italian medical discourse may lack the critical mass, at least in its written textualisations, to survive as a fully-functional medium for public communication.

# 3. Analysis of a bilingual sample of MEDs

To evaluate similarities/divergences between English MEDs written by Italian and NS researchers, a bilingual sample of recent texts was assembled from six peer-reviewed Italian journals with online content. A comparable number of English NS texts was also included as a control. For NS English, the sources are the Journal of Clinical Investigation and British Journal of Plastic Surgery; for NNS English, the Italian journals Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale and Italian Heart Journal; for Italian, Recenti Progressi in Medicina and Giornale Italiano di Cardiologia. The five latest available editorials, published between 2002 and 2006, were then extracted from each journal (for further information refer to the Appendix).

# 3.1. Titles and opening sentences

The opening lines of a text are of special rhetorical significance as they introduce the topic in a way that seeks to engage the reader’s attention. In the research article (RA) and other academic genres, this move is widely referred to as establishing a territory and generally unfolds through ‘‘topic generalizations of increasing specificity’’ (Swales, 2004, p. 230). It was therefore decided to investigate the constituents of opening sentences in the MED corpus, taking especially into account the functional-semantic links with the titles that precede such sentences. Though often neglected in RA studies, the relationship between title and first sentence is a valuable source of information on how different cultural and/or disciplinary communities organise their information and may help to uncover divergences between the three parts of our corpus.

The recurring constituents identified are these:

- Linked events, developments within in the life of the journal, the scientific community or society at large that are somehow linked to the object of the article, as defined in the title.   
- Relevance, any explicit reference to the importance, popularity or appropriateness of the topic introduced in the title.   
- Calls for action, more or less urgent requests for action on the part of the community or outsiders, often in response to some kind of crisis.   
- Modified items and repeated items, words/phrases that appear in the title and recur in the opening sentence of a MED either in a modified form (e.g., a synonym, metonym, superordinate or hyponym) or repeated verbatim as in the title.

Table 2 illustrates the relative frequency of these opening-sentence constituents across the corpus, counting also repeated instances within the same sentence. Though only indicative of general trends in Italian and English (NS vs. NNS), the figures indicate certain similarities: most notably, the fact that with the exception of ‘Calls for action,’ all the categories are represented in the three subcorpora; secondly, an identical number of ‘Modified items’ and almost equal numbers of ‘Relevance’ instances can be observed across the corpus.

On the other hand, there are some interesting differences: the presence of ‘Calls for action’ only in Italian and the reluctance of NNS English to include ‘Linked events,’ while ‘Repeated items’ are twice as frequent. The main difference, therefore, appears to be in the NNS sample, which seldom contextualises the topic by linking it to events that are familiar/relevant to the editor and her/his audience; instead, the wording tends to tread safer ground by ‘recycling’ elements used in the title.

Examples of these categories are given below. In the NS sample, the opening sentence contains two linked events (recent uproar/comments. made by Harvard University President), partly overlapping with four relevance markers (recent/uproar/much needed attention/issue of great importance), and a semantically modified item (sex and the university system women in science).

# (NS) Sex and the university system

The recent uproar over comments about women in science made by Harvard University President Dr. Lawrence Summers has helped focus much needed attention on an issue of great importance.

Table 2 Opening-sentence constituents (total occurrences) of medical editorials in Italian (ITA) and in English written by non-native speakers (NNS) and native speakers (NS)   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Linked events</td><td>Relevance</td><td>Calls for action</td><td>Modified items</td><td>Repeated items</td></tr><tr><td>ITA</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>NNS</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>-</td><td>11</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>NS</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>-</td><td>11</td><td>4</td></tr></table></body></html>

In the next example, taken from a NNS journal, there is only one very vague linked event (evidence has grown in the last decade), a relevance marker (has grown) and a modified item (angioplasty, instead of thrombolysis primary angioplasty (PPTCA) is superior to thrombolysis) with three reiterations (primary angioplasty/thrombolysis/acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction)

(NNS) Primary angioplasty, instead of thrombolysis, for all patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction? Evidence has grown in the last decade, showing that primary angioplasty (PPTCA) is superior to thrombolysis (TL) in the treatment of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI).

Judging from these figures, similarities are stronger between Italian and English NS discourse, which is more highly contextualised and stylistically accomplished than the NNS sample. Admittedly, the choice of constituent will depend also on the kind of topic, which in MEDs may range from broad discussions of advances in clinical practice to engagement in burning healthcare policy issues.

# 3.2. First-person markers

Marking first-person involvement, whether in the singular or plural, has been widely investigated in professional and disciplinary discourses. Fløttum (2006), for example, found relatively few of these items in Norwegian, French and English medical RAs. In a recent analysis of personal pronouns in English vs. Ukrainian/Russian conference abstracts, Yakhontova (2006, p. 165) warns that ‘‘while the demonstration of differences between English texts and those in other languages can indeed be of great help, the efforts to explain them in sociocultural terms may not be necessarily important.’’ The presence of different proclivities can be simply indicative of textual traditions within speech communities. Bearing this in mind, the corpus was scanned for first-person markers (not only personal pronouns but also possessives and, in Italian, first-person inflected verbs) which were then classified by referent. The results, normalised to 10,000 words for each subcorpus, are summarised in Table 3

The most noticeable pattern is the progression from Italian to NNS to NS English, with the last of these containing the highest number of markers in all categories e apart from a negligible number of impersonal cases. The overall count is more than ten times higher in NS English compared to Italian (218.2 vs. 20.5) and this disparity becomes most evident when the referent is the journal itself. There is also a stark prevalence of author-marking in Italian and NS English, whereas NS texts are more likely to mark the community.

It is difficult to say whether the higher presence of these items in NNS is due mainly to the use of English or rather to the different potential audience targeted by a global language. The latter interpretation might be more plausible if one considers the prevalence of community-marking in NNS, which may be a reaction to the greater uncertainty experienced when addressing a faceless international audience. The NNS texts also contained more self-citations (6) than the Italian (2) and NS sample (1), perhaps in an effort to project/promote the editor’s previous publications beyond the national medical community.

Table 3 First-person markers by referent (occurrences per 10,000 words)   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Author(s)</td><td>Community</td><td> Journal</td><td>Nation</td><td>Global</td><td> Impersonal</td><td>ALL</td></tr><tr><td>ITA</td><td>9.9</td><td>7.2</td><td>2.1</td><td>-</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.7</td><td>20.5</td></tr><tr><td>NNS</td><td>20.3</td><td>43.8</td><td>2.1</td><td>0.8</td><td></td><td>3.7</td><td>70.7</td></tr><tr><td>NS</td><td>96.6</td><td>75.9</td><td>41.1</td><td>3.9</td><td>0.7</td><td>-</td><td>218.2</td></tr></table></body></html>

In single-authored MEDs (i.e., when first-person singular is an option), a considerable disparity is observed between NS English realisations and the other two categories of text (Table 4). While ‘I’ forms account for $3 1 . 5 \%$ of markers in the former, they are less than $10 \%$ in the latter (virtually none of the plural forms were instances of academic ‘we’).

Table 4 First-person singular and plural markers in single-authored EDs (occurrences/10,000 words)   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>&#x27;we&#x27;</td></tr><tr><td>ITA %</td><td>8.6</td><td>91.4</td></tr><tr><td>No.</td><td>0.6</td><td>6.4</td></tr><tr><td>NNS %</td><td>5.2</td><td>94.8</td></tr><tr><td>No.</td><td>6.1</td><td>110.9</td></tr><tr><td>NS %</td><td>31.5</td><td>68.5</td></tr><tr><td>No.</td><td>65.1</td><td>141.3</td></tr></table></body></html>

These results suggest that NS editorialists are particularly prone to take a personal stance in single-authored MEDs. Italians, on the other hand (whether writing in their language or in English) tend to avoid direct self-reference in such cases. Vassileva (2006) found a similar gap between NS English and other European languages (i.e., German and Bulgarian) in an academic RAs.

The NNS sample was only slightly more liable to contain ‘I’ forms but much more likely to use ‘we’ marking, with 110.9 occurrences vs. only 6.4 in Italian. Compared to the figures in Table 3, the number of occurrences is very similar here for NS while it is much higher for the other two groups. When publishing a MED single-handedly, Italian editorialists make an increased use of ‘we’ markers e almost as if to offset the relative isolation experienced by members of smaller, more peripheral scientific communities.

# 3.3. Communicating closure

As different parts of the corpus were scanned for linguistic data, one of the features that became evident was the variety of options used in the closing moves of MEDs. The next step, therefore, was to investigate whether the last sentence in such texts communicates ‘closure,’ i.e., a signal that the text has reached its rhetorical conclusion. Closure is a standard feature of structured, written genres, where it performs ‘‘the ritual signing-off’’ of the writer/reader relationship (Hyland, 2003, p. 256). As most MEDs, predictably, contained this element, they were subdivided according to the functional/semantic content deployed in the closing sentence (Table 5).

While all the NS English MEDs signal closure, two NNS and one Italian text lacked this element altogether. ‘Call for action’ is the preferred option across the corpus. The ‘Implications’ option reflects the step (Move 11.2. Indicating research implications) identified by Nwogu (1997) at the end of medical RA Conclusions. On the other hand, only two instances e both in Italian e were found of the step (Indicating a knowledge gap) found by V-azquez y del Arbol - (2005) at the end of Spanish and English MEDs. A statement of commitment occurs in one NS English text.

# 4. Discussion and conclusions

Medical communication is a case in point of the benefits and drawbacks of opting for English as a lingua franca for disciplinary communication, with $90 \%$ of indexed publications using this medium and those published in other languages often limiting their scope to local audiences and concerns. Coupled with this is a huge imbalance in the distribution of resources allocated to healthcare provision/research internationally (cf. Sumathipala, Siribaddana, & Patel, 2004). No less than $98 \%$ of articles published in the 50 top biomedical journals, for example, are written by researchers working in the US, Canada, Western Europe or Japan (Soteriades, Rosmarakis, Paraschakis, & Falagas, 2006). Those from non English-speaking backgrounds are of course faced with the further challenge of crafting linguistically acceptable publications for international journals and may complain that language editing absorbs time otherwise available for research (Hwang, 2005). In some cases (cf. Gibbs, 1995) the option is to delocalise peripheral publications by shifting to English or even hiring a native speaker as an editor. Italy is no exception to such trends and it is the norm today to read and publish medical research in English, rather than Italian. The sharp decline in Italian PubMed entries since 1986 bears witness to the marginalisation of the language, which is increasingly uncommon even in journals targeting a largely domestic audience.

Table 5 How closure is signalled in MEDs   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Call for action</td><td>Implications</td><td>Knowledge gap</td><td>Commitment</td><td>No closure</td></tr><tr><td>ITA*</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>NNS</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>NS</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr></table></body></html>

One text is not included here because it is the transcript of a conference talk.

From this comparison of features of medical discourse in MEDs taken from Anglo-American journals for NS English and from Italian journals for NNS English and Italian, a number of aspects have emerged which suggest the gradual peripheralisation of Italian, combined with a hybridisation of English. In terms of first person-marking, the NNS realisations may operate as ‘intertexts,’ mediating between two native-speaker models, with total occurrences averaging 20.5 in Italian, 70.7 in NNS and 218.2 in NS English. At the same time, the prevalent use of markers in NNS texts to indicate the medical community rather than the author could be interpreted as evidence of the insecure membership status perceived by Italian editors addressing an English-speaking readership.

A simple analysis of the opening sentence of MEDs indicates again that the NNS discourse is decontextualized, in comparison to its NS English and Italian counterparts. Events linked to the topic to be dealt with are seldom mentioned, as if editorialists were unsure of the schemata available to readers. At the other end of such texts, the signalling of closure, though mandatory in NS English, was found to be occasionally absent in the Italian and NNS samples, as if their structural-rhetorical norms were looser and still evolving.

Bearing in mind the caveat that ‘‘occurrence, acceptability, preference, and prescription are different things, and that we should not take the occurrence of a variant as undeniable evidence of its acceptability’’ (Shaw et al., 2004, p. 398), this investigation of intertextual variation in MEDs suggests that the shift to English in medical writing operates in two opposite directions. On the one hand it brings features of the L1 and L2 discourse to converge within NNS realisations, e an example of the discoursal interference observed in translation (Zauberga, 2001). At a deeper level, however, the wider membership and projected audience issuing from a change of language disrupt both the source and target discourse. It would be interesting to monitor such developments and establish whether, in perspective, they are preliminary to a stabilisation of academic lingua franca English or are merely a symptom of the heterogeneous repertoire that characterises NNS writing also in educational settings.
