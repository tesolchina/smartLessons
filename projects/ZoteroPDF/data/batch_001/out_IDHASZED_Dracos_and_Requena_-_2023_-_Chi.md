# ABSTRACT

The Spanish subjunctive mood (SUBJ) is said to be highly vulnerable in heritage language (HL) acquisition. However, there is little controlled research on HLspeaking children acquiring the various Spanish SUBJ contexts, so we do not have a clear picture of when, how, or why heritage speakers (HSs) develop in the SUBJ as they do. This study tests the development of the SUBJ in two of the earliest acquired contexts by monolingual children—SUBJ with volitional clauses and adverbial clauses with future reference. Through an oral sentencecompletion task administered to 50 school-aged child HSs, this study observes whether language-internal factors (modality, variability) and speaker factors (age, exposure/use, or morphosyntactic proficiency) influence acquisition of the SUBJ in the examined contexts. Although SUBJ is categorically used in the first-generation input the child HSs receive at home, school-aged HSs exhibit elevated optionality; the majority show a pattern of use typical of very young monolingual children, and there is wide variance among the child HSs across all ages. Overall, they exhibit slightly more optionality within epistemic modality (adverbials) than deontic modality (volition). Crucially, exposure to and use of Spanish and, even more so, a standardized measure of Spanish morphosyntactic proficiency were strongly associated with SUBJ use in both contexts by the child HSs. We argue that the observed vulnerability in these early-acquired SUBJ contexts follows from an interaction between the child ${ \sf H S 5 ^ { \prime } }$ engagement with the HL environment (including their resulting command of the HL grammar) and linguistic factors common to all SUBJ contexts.

# 1. Introduction

The Spanish subjunctive (SUBJ) appears to be particularly vulnerable in heritage language (HL) grammars (Montrul 2016, 2021). Heritage speakers (HSs)1 are simultaneous or early sequential bilinguals acquiring both a minority HL and a majority language (Benmamoun, Montrul & Polinsky 2013; Polinsky & Scontras 2020; Valdés 2000), and research suggests that their Spanish SUBJ use differs quantitatively and qualitatively from that of first-generation speakers. Quantitatively, secondgeneration adult HSs as a group exhibit elevated optionality compared to first-generation speakers (e.g., Montrul 2007, 2009; Giancaspro 2019; Perez-Cortes 2021a, 2021b; Silva-Corvalán 1994), and rates of SUBJ undergo a marked decrease across generations (e.g., Lynch 1999; Silva Corvalán 1994; Viner 2016, 2018). Qualitatively, “many adult HSs display morphological and syntactic errors typical of early language development in monolingual children” (Montrul & Polinsky 2019:423), and some individual HSs may not produce the SUBJ at all in certain grammatical contexts (Silva-Corvalán 1994). Presumably, these differences in HS SUBJ use stem from the dynamics of exposure and use during childhood (Silva-Corvalán 2018), and it is known that HSs can differ in their exposure to and use of the HL. Further, although second-generation HSs are typically surrounded by the HL in the home throughout their early years, they tend to be exposed to more of the majority language and less of the HL throughout their school-aged years.

Although there is broad agreement about this general picture in adult HS use of the SUBJ, there is what Montrul (2018) calls a “missing link” in the research. In general, research on HS adults “has uncovered a number of structural properties characteristic of HL,” but without research on bilingual children, “the origin of these recurrent properties” remains unclear (Polinsky 2018:548). Presently, there is little research on the development of mood selection in bilingual children, particularly during the school-aged years (but see, e.g., Merino 1983 for HSs of Spanish and Flores et al. 2017 for HSs of Portuguese). Therefore, although research on adult HSs’ SUBJ use shows that it does differ from that of the first-generation input, without research on language development throughout the school years, we do not have a clear picture of when, how, or why these changes in HSs’ Spanish mood selection occur.

Addressing this gap in the research is a laborious task. First, researchers need to observe child participants’ HL exposure, their development in the HL, and the quality of their input (e.g., SUBJ use by first-generation speakers). Next, there are many distinct SUBJ contexts that develop over a protracted period. Although monolingual Spanish-speaking children begin producing SUBJ forms with volitional and adverbial clauses around ages 2–3, they do not master these contexts until around age 5 (Blake 1980; Dracos, Requena & Miller 2019). Yet it takes them until ages 7–10 to master the more complex uses of SUBJ with relative clauses or sentential complements (Pérez-Leroux 1998; Dracos, Requena & Miller 2019; see also Jesus, Marques & Santos 2019 for monolingual development in Portuguese). Thus, there is consensus in the monolingual literature that the acquisition of the SUBJ follows a particular developmental path, summarized in (1).

(1) volitional clauses $>$ adverbial clauses $>$ relative clauses $>$ sentential complements

Moreover, the research with adult HSs suggests that the earlier-acquired SUBJ contexts in (1) pose considerably less difficulty for adult HSs as compared to later-acquired contexts (e.g., Montrul 2009, 2021; Pascual y Cabo, Lingwall & Rothman 2012; Perez-Cortes 2021b; van Osch, Sleeman & Aalberse 2017; Van Osch & Sleeman 2018; Viner 2016, 2018). This has led researchers to consider what linguistic features make certain contexts more straightforward to acquire than others. For instance, earlieracquired contexts may exhibit higher frequency of use, reduced syntactic or semantic (modal) complexity, or lack of variability (i.e., SUBJ is obligatorily selected under certain predicates). In addition, the fact that child HSs are more likely to be exposed to extensive amounts of the HL in the early years could offer advantages for the earlier-acquired contexts among monolinguals. Indeed, the protracted monolingual development of the various SUBJ contexts occurs during the period in which HSs typically undergo shifts in their HL exposure and use (i.e., the school years). Accordingly, research on how, when, and why HSs develop in the SUBJ as they do must examine the acquisition of SUBJ in each particular SUBJ context while simultaneously observing the child HSs’ experience with (exposure/use) and knowledge of (proficiency) the HL as well as the characteristics of their input (provided by first-generation speakers).

The present study begins this extensive research project. Believing that early-acquired SUBJ contexts (among monolinguals) present the best test of whether child HSs develop the SUBJ, this study examines child HSs’ SUBJ development in volitional clauses and adverbial clauses with future reference. Although prior research suggests that HS adults perform better in these early-acquired SUBJ contexts than in later-acquired ones, this study examines the topic developmentally. Do HS children, like monolinguals, master these SUBJ contexts early on or, instead, exhibit development in them throughout the school-aged years? We address this question through an elicited production task administered to 50 school-aged child HSs of Spanish (ages 5–14) from central Texas. Further, we compare the child participants to 23 first-generation adult speakers from the same community, and the study controls for factors that may be conditioning their SUBJ usage—modality, variability, exposure/use, and morphosyntactic knowledge in English and Spanish. Consequently, this study provides what we believe to be the most detailed account of Spanish-English bilingual child develop ment of these Spanish SUBJ contexts predicted to be some of the easiest to acquire.

# 2. Background

# 2.1. The Spanish subjunctive and considerations for its acquisition

Since this study examines child HS development in the Spanish subjunctive (SUBJ) with volitional clauses and adverbial clauses with future reference, it is necessary to detail a few linguistic factors that may make these some of the earliest acquired SUBJ contexts (see 1). To do so, (i) we will survey the grammar of the Spanish SUBJ and its various contexts, and (ii) we will explore factors that may modulate their acquisition.

While the indicative (IND) mood is usually taken as the default mood for assertions like el niño audiciona (IND) para la orquesta ‘the child auditions for the orchestra,’ the Spanish SUBJ mood is a grammatical means to instantiate various propositional attitudes or, that is, modality (e.g., Deen 2016; Fábregas 2014; Kempchinsky 2009). Examples (2) through (5) illustrate contexts where the SUBJ instantiates different modal meanings.

(2) Volitional clause:

La madre quiere que el niño audicione para la orquesta. The mother want.3SG.IND that the child audition.3SG.SUBJ for the orchestra ‘The mother wants the child to audition for the orchestra.’

(3) Adverbial clause:

(a) Cuando la orquesta busque violinistas, el niño se presentará. When the orchestra look.3SG.SUBJ for violinists, the child try out.3SG.FUT ‘When the orchestra looks for violinists, the child will try out.’   
(b) Cuando la orquesta busca violinistas, el niño se presenta cada vez. When the orchestra look.3SG.IND for violinists, the child try out.3SG.IND each time ‘Every time the orchestra looks for violinists, the child tries out.’

(4) Relative clause:

La orquesta busca niños que to can/to quen el violín. ‘The orchestra look.3SG.IND for children that play.3PL.IND/SUBJ the violin ‘The orchestra looks for children who play (definite referent/indefinite referent) the violin.’

(5) Sentential complement:

La madre no cree que su hijo se anime/se anima a to car en la audición. The mother not believe.3SG.IND that her son dare.3SG.SUBJ/IND to play in the audition ‘The mother does not believe her son would dare (default)/dares (only felicitous if the speaker believes the proposition that the mother does not) play in the audition.’

In these examples, it is evident that Spanish SUBJ use involves more than mood morphology. Spanish SUBJ use includes mappings between mood morphology, diverse semantics, syntax, and (sometimes) pragmatics.

First, the SUBJ mood expresses propositional attitudes, but there are semantic differences among the Spanish SUBJ uses. Scholars often sort the SUBJ uses into the following three modalities (e.g., Chung & Timberlake 1985; Lozano 1995; Palmer 2001; Pérez-Leroux 1998):

● Deontic modality—degrees of obligation. Here a speaker expresses how she (or someone else) wants the world to be (e.g., in 2), or how she (or someone else) feels it should or must be.

● Epistemic modality—degrees or types of beliefs in a proposition. A speaker may think a future discrete event could, might, or will occur (e.g., in 3a). More intricately, a speaker may (e.g., in 4) express that some NP has an indefinite referent (e.g., does not exist or could not exist). Epistemological modality—explicit statement of an individual’s degree or type of belief in a proposition. A speaker may (as in 5) report on someone else’s lack of belief in a proposition while the speaker remains neutral on it (Harrington & Pérez-Leroux 2016; Pascual y Cabo, Lingwall & Rothman 2012).

Accordingly, whereas other morphological forms may represent a one-form-to-one-meaning relation (e.g., preterite $=$ finished past action), the SUBJ involves a single morphological form (mood morphology) corresponding to many distinct semantic meanings (Montrul 2009).

Second, the Spanish SUBJ is used to instantiate modal meanings in specific syntactic environments, typically in subordinate clauses selected under particular predicates or the scope of a modal or negation (Harrington & Pérez-Leroux 2016). For example, volitional clauses, like (2), occur under subordination with non-co-referential subjects and always take the SUBJ. Similarly, as exemplified in (3a), “in temporal subordinate clauses, when they are oriented towards the future from the time of utterance or from the perspective of the event expressed by the main verb in the clause, Spanish needs subjunctive” (Fábregas 2014:17). However, it is important to note that Spanish speakers may employ alternative and felicitous grammatical constructions to instantiate the modal meanings. For instance, in addition to SUBJ with querer ‘to want’, as in (2), Spanish speakers have a myriad of ways to express volition with other linguistic constructions. They can, for example, use a sequence of sentences including periphrases of obligation (such as tener que $^ +$ inf ‘have to’ or deber $^ +$ inf ‘must’) in the IND (as in 6), make use of polite imperatives (as in 7), or embed commands into a reported speech construction that does not require the SUBJ (for evidence of some of these alternatives in adult HSs, see Perez-Cortes 2021a). Moreover, in lieu of a complex sentence with the adverbial cuando ‘when’ followed by SUBJ, as in (3a), a speaker can relay a sequence of events and futurity with distinct IND sentences, as in (8).

(6) El niño tiene que audicionar para la orquesta. Eso es lo que quiere su madre. The boy have.3SG.IND to audition for the orchestra. This is what want.3SG.IND his mother ‘The child has to audition for the orchestra. This is what his mother wants.’   
(7) Por favor, audiciona para la orquesta. Please, audition.2SG.IMP for the orchestra ‘Please, audition for the orchestra.’   
(8) La orquesta [va a buscar] violinistas. Entonces, el niño se presentará. The orchestra [go.3SG.IND to look for].PERFUT2 violinists. At that time, the child try out.3SG.FUT. ‘The orchestra is going to look for violinists. At that time, the child will try out.’

Therefore, these given modal meanings can be instantiated with the SUBJ mood in specific syntactic environments, or they can be instantiated felicitously through alternatives.

Third, the SUBJ is sometimes categorically and sometimes variably selected under certain predicates. For instance, querer ‘to want’ (with non-co-referential subjects) and the adverbial antes de ‘before’ always express desire or belief about what is to come and categorically take the SUBJ. Other predicates variably select the SUBJ or IND. Although both moods are grammatical in such contexts, SUBJ and IND express distinct semantic meanings. In these cases, mood selection is determined pragmatically. For example, if a speaker uses cuando ‘when’ to introduce a temporal clause with future orientation (3a), this adverbial selects the SUBJ. However, cuando selects the IND if it does not express future reference and carries present habitual or past reference (3b). Relative clauses and sentential complements, exemplified in (4) and (5), are also variable. Accordingly, where categorical mood selection is determined by lexical triggers, mood selection in variable contexts depends on the association of a specific pragmatic context (e.g., future versus habitual reference in example 3) with the specific mood morphology (SUBJ vs. IND).

Turning now from the general grammar of the Spanish SUBJ to considerations for its acquisition, the intricate mappings involved in Spanish SUBJ contexts are not always transparent for learners (Montrul 2009:266). Indeed, the Spanish SUBJ mood’s connections with diverse semantics, syntax, and (sometimes) pragmatics could contribute to development in the SUBJ lagging behind the IND and protracted development across the SUBJ contexts (see 1).

Researchers point to three differences among the SUBJ contexts to account for the acquisition of some SUBJ uses before others. First, some SUBJ contexts are more frequently used than others (e.g., Silva-Corvalán 1994, 2014). For example, SUBJ with volitional and adverbial clauses may be more common in the input than SUBJ with relative clauses or sentential complements. Second, researchers have observed that children acquire deontic modality before epistemic and epistemic before epistemological, perhaps because the distinct modalities require different Theory of Mind (ToM) development (e.g., Pérez Leroux 1998; Perez-Cortes 2021b). For example, desires or beliefs about what is to come may be within the grasp of a child’s early emerging ToM, but relative clauses or the negative polarity SUBJ may implicate more sophisticated abilities to evaluate false beliefs, motives, and others’ beliefs as well as intentions (Wellman 2014; Pérez Leroux 1998; Dracos, Requena & Miller 2019). Third, since variable contexts require speakers to determine a pragmatic rule regulating mood selection out of variable input, researchers have hypothesized that variable contexts are more linguistically complex than categorical contexts for learners (e.g., Montrul 2009; Van Osch & Sleeman 2018; Pascual y Cabo, Lingwall & Rothman 2012). Moreover, mood selection with variable relative clauses and sentential complements pivots around the aforementioned subtle and cognitively taxing distinction, which could make them even more difficult to acquire (e.g., Silva-Corvalán 1994).

Accordingly, volition (2) and adverbials (3) (the focus of this study) appear to be among the most linguistically simple Spanish SUBJ contexts. In comparison to SUBJ with relative clauses or sentential complements, the SUBJ with the predicates querer ‘to want,’ antes de ‘before,’ and cuando ‘when’ are relatively common in the input, express a relatively simple modality, and are categorical or variable with a strong, apparent semantic distinction. Such relative linguistic simplicity may contribute to these SUBJ contexts being mastered before other contexts (see 1). Nonetheless, there is a modal-semantic distinction between querer (deontic) and antes de and cuando (epistemic), and selection of the SUBJ is categorical with antes de but variable with cuando. These factors could, in turn, affect acquisition of the SUBJ in these conditions, and we will examine them in the present study.

However, SUBJ with volition and adverbials being earlier acquired (by monolinguals) than other SUBJ contexts does not mean that they are devoid of complexity. Instead, all SUBJ contexts exhibit features that make them more complex or later acquired than the IND and other Spanish morphosyntactic structures.

# 2.1.1. Availability in the input, morphosyntactic complexity, and communicative value

Acquisition of SUBJ forms could be modulated by SUBJ being less frequent in the input than the IND, regardless of tense or aspect (e.g., Collentine 2010; Fábregas 2014, Montrul 2016; Pérez-Leroux 1998). For instance, an analysis of 2,085,990 spoken and written verb forms in the Corpus del español revealed that the SUBJ, whether in the present or the imperfect, accounts for only about $7 . 2 \%$ of all verb forms (Biber et al. 2006; see also the summary in Collentine 2010).

Moreover, the Spanish SUBJ typically appears in longer sentences requiring embedding (nominal, adjectival, or adverbial subordinate clauses). These complex sentences have an IND verb (in the main clause), include tense and aspect, and contain other morphosyntactic features. Accordingly, the Spanish SUBJ occurs in grammatical contexts containing many morphosyntactic layers that make SUBJ sentences relatively difficult to process and produce (e.g., Collentine 2010; Montrul 2021; Peréz-Leroux 1998; Silva-Corvalán 2014). As Montrul (2021) recently highlighted, “subjunctive is required in complex sentences, so learners need to have the syntax in place to support subjunctive morphology” (p. 545).

Regarding communicative value, as mentioned, Spanish has many alternative and felicitous ways to express modality, which are constructed out of earlier acquired grammatical structures (e.g., IND and imperatives). Moreover, the Spanish SUBJ often occurs in scenarios in which surrounding lexical items or context obviate any semantic content expressed with the SUBJ mood morphology, and the modal meaning would thus be conveyed despite innovative IND usage (traditionally considered ungrammatical or nontarget). For predicates that categorically select the SUBJ like querer ‘to want’ and antes de ‘before,’ the modal meaning of the SUBJ is already contained in the matrix verb or temporal adverbial expression, and SUBJ is therefore semantically redundant (e.g., Collentine 2010; Giancaspro 2020; Lantolf 1978). Although SUBJ with the variable cuando contributes novel semantic meaning (i.e., futurity), these sentences can and often do include other temporal expressions or contextual cues that render the future reference carried by the SUBJ redundant. Therefore, the Spanish SUBJ has low communicative value because felicitous alternatives and innovative IND usage can reliably express modal meanings.

In conclusion, all SUBJ contexts, even some of the earliest acquired ones including volitional and adverbial clauses, are linguistically complex relative to the IND and other grammatical features on account of being less available in the input, exhibiting more morphosyntactic complexity, and having low communicative value. These features common to all Spanish SUBJ contexts suggest a general dynamic for the SUBJ’s acquisition. Language learners who have not received sufficient input in the target structure or developed sufficient morphosyntactic knowledge will resort to felicitous alternatives or innovative IND to express modality. This dynamic can be seen clearly in monolingual development of the Spanish SUBJ with volitional and adverbial clauses.

# 2.2. Previous research on the monolingual acquisition of Spanish SUBJ with volitional and adverbial clauses

The present study examines the development of Spanish SUBJ with volition and adverbials among child HSs. Although monolinguals should not be considered the baseline for HSs (Pascual y Cabo & Rothman 2012; Polinsky & Scontras 2020; Serratrice 2020; see also Method section 3.1), a review of monolingual development in these conditions provides a good point of comparison for this study on HS development in these SUBJ contexts.

In various ways, very young children begin to express desires for and beliefs about the world being one way rather than another. Monolingual children in English, Greek, Turkish, Finnish, and Portuguese begin producing modals to express deontic modality around age 2 (Dean 2016; Brown 1973; Stephany 1986), and epistemic modals expressing future reference tend to occur later around age 3 (Deen 2016; Choi 1991, 1995). The case is the same for monolingual Spanish-speaking children. The first uses of the SUBJ are with negative imperatives (Han 1999) and volition, occurring around age 2 (Aguirre 2000; Hernández-Pina 1984; López Ornat 1994). Consider examples (9–10) produced by Magín at 1;10 and 2;04 (Aguirre 2000).

(9) no te asustes (SUBJ), papá. ‘Don’t be scared, dad.’HT (011027, line 535)   
(10) porque no tero [: quiero] ten(g)a (SUBJ) frío. ‘Because I don’t want (him) to be cold.’HT (020425, line 2234)

Similarly, monolingual children begin to produce the Spanish SUBJ mood in temporal clauses at a young but slightly later age, around their third birthday (Hernandez-Pina 1984; Aparici et al. 2001), as in (11) from Gonzalez (1978:38).3

(11) Cuando venga (SUBJ) Benito, voy a volar la huila. / When Benito comes, I’m going to fly the kite. (3;03)

Therefore, children at a very young age possess the requisite ToM to grasp the difference between mere assertion and expressing a desire or belief about discrete future events.

Nonetheless, although very young children “seem eager and willing” to express modality, they do not always use the same forms that adults would use to express the same meanings (Deen 2016:384). Children express, for example, deontic modality in a variety of ways. Children of German, French, and Icelandic languages recruit root-infinitives to express deontic modality through age 3. Similar-aged Italian children rely on imperatives (Salustri & Hyams 2003), and Greek children exhibit an admixture of imperatives, SUBJ, and innovative IND uses (Stephany 1986). Although these childlike ways of expressing modality may seem full of errors, the children express modality through the morphological devices available to them. Accordingly, while children grasp the relevant deontic and epistemic modalities very early, they do not achieve target-like expression until later, probably between ages 4–6.

The available experimental research on monolingual acquisition of Spanish SUBJ with deontic modality supports the findings from other languages. As seen in Table 1, the studies report different SUBJ usage rates, and this difference follows from distinct methodologies. The studies that observed lower rates employed a question-answer elicitation task. For example, Morgan, Estrepa & Azuza (2013) reported that the children would sometimes not respond in the target structure and resort to alternative (and felicitous) responses, such as the infinitive. It is unclear whether these alternative responses reflect a lack of facility with the SUBJ in this context or a mere preference for alternative responses.

In contrast, studies that show (near) categorical SUBJ selection employ a sentence completion task (Blake 1980; Dracos, Requena & Miller 2019). Consider (12):

(12) Es la hora de acostarse para el niño. Eso es lo que quiere el papa. El papá quiere que el niño . . . Target response: ‘ . . . se acueste (SUBJ).’ ‘It’s time for this child to go to bed. That’s what dad wants. The dad wants that the child . . . Target response: ‘ . . . goes to bed (SUBJ).’

By providing the matrix clause, the subordinating conjunction (que ‘that’), and the subject of the subordinate clause (el niño ‘the child’ in 12), the participant is forced into a grammatical context that uniformly selects a finite verb in the SUBJ mood. Thus, any response other than the SUBJ is nontarget and indicates a lack of command of the SUBJ. Blake’s (1980) pilot study reported target-like SUBJ use with volitional clauses (querer ‘to want,’ ser necesario ‘be necessary,’ and esperar ‘to hope’) at 4;00. Blake’s follow-up study (1980, 1983) found that just after age 6;00 all children used SUBJ at adult levels. Nonetheless, Blake does not break down results by verb and only has one trial per verb. Dracos, Requena & Miller (2019), whose design was adapted for this study, shows target-like categorical SUBJ by 5;00 with querer. In fact, 16/21 four-year-olds also selected the SUBJ categorically with querer in their study. Accordingly, although children may still prefer felicitous alternatives to the SUBJ in naturalistic conversation, we conclude that monolingual children by age 4–5 categorically select the SUBJ if and when they produce the querer construction in this volitional context.

Note. Blake (1980), Sánchez-Naranjo & Pérez-Leroux (2010), and Dracos et al. (2019) tested additional conditions not summarized here. An in-text discussion is provided for adverbial conditions examined in Blake (1980) and SánchezNaranjo & Pérez-Leroux (2010). \*Rate obtained through personal communication.

Less research is available for SUBJ with adverbials. Blake (1980), using a sentence-completion task with several adverbials (antes de ‘before,’ cuando ‘when,’ para que ‘so that,’ hasta ‘until,’ después de ‘after’), reported a few errors occurring around age 4;00 $7 \% - 1 1 \%$ across the pilot and follow-up study) and suggests full acquisition of the SUBJ with adverbials occurs shortly after that. However, again, no breakdown of results by particular adverbials is given. Other studies find lower SUBJ rates for cuando (with future reference), but these studies employ a question-answer task that allows for non-adult-like but still grammatical nonclausal responses consisting of an NP, PP, and AdvP (Sánchez-Naranjo & Pérez-Leroux 2010; Castilla-Earls et al., 2020). For example, although the children in Sánchez-Naranjo & Pérez-Leroux’s study produced many of these alternative responses early on, by age 5;00 their SUBJ usage did not differ significantly from controls (10-year-olds) in the variable cuando condition (in the present tense), which suggests advanced facility with the SUBJ in this context. However, their results with categorical antes de (in the present tense) are difficult to interpret. Although the children aged 3–5 rarely responded with innovative IND uses, they also rarely responded with the SUBJ. Most responses were alternative responses or nonresponses (i.e., could not be coded for mood). Due to the study’s design, it is unclear whether this indicates a lack of facility with the SUBJ in this condition or a strong preference for alternative responses. Though, given everything said previously regarding monolinguals of other languages and some results from HSs (see the following), we think the latter is more likely.

The aforementioned research suggests a clear developmental picture that we will assume henceforth. First, by ages 2;00 and 3;00 respectively, children have developed the cognitive abilities needed to grasp desires for and beliefs about future events. They immediately begin to express such in a way that corresponds to their present grammatical knowledge—some SUBJ but also nontarget innovations and target-like alternative means of expressing modality. Second, by 4–5, they have developed the morphosyntactic knowledge and been exposed to enough input to know that volitional clauses always take the SUBJ. Withstanding some lingering doubts about antes de, similar error-free usage of SUBJ in temporal adverbial clauses occurs simultaneously or shortly after that. At this stage, although they still may use felicitous alternative responses in naturalistic conversation, they know how to instantiate the modality with the SUBJ in these contexts.

# 2.3. HSs and Spanish SUBJ with volitional and adverbial clauses

Figures 1 and 2 present the results from pertinent naturalistic or elicited production studies on adult Spanish HSs’ usage of SUBJ to express volition or beliefs about future events. Aside from the somewhat surprising fact that Lustres, Garcia-Tejada & Cuza (2020) and Dracos, Requena & Nuñez (2021) do not find any significant difference between HSs’ usage in the variable cuando and the categorical antes de, the results are what we would expect. First-generation speakers exhibit nearly categorical use of the SUBJ. Second-generation HSs still strongly prefer SUBJ use, albeit slightly less so for adverbials with futurity.

However, upon closer inspection, the results from the research on adult HSs suggest a complex picture. To begin, a strong preference for SUBJ use in these contexts is not categorical use. Overall, second-generation HSs do diverge from baseline, which some may interpret as incomplete acquisition, and others, such as Viner (2016), argue to be evidence that these contexts are becoming a variable mood grammar. Moreover, there are individual differences among second-generation HSs. Supporting Montrul’s (2007, 2009) findings, Perez-Cortes (2021b), also using an adapted version of the DELE proficiency test, showed that high-proficiency HSs exhibited little optionality $( 9 6 \% )$ compared to intermediate- $( 7 3 \% )$ and low-proficiency HSs $( 2 3 \% )$ . Viner (2016) found that self-reported Spanish proficiency level was the only external variable significantly correlated with the participants’ SUBJ use. Accordingly, even for some of the earliest acquired SUBJ uses among monolinguals, all but perhaps the highest proficiency adult HSs exhibit optionality, and the low-proficiency ones strongly prefer the IND.

What is the child HSs’ developmental trajectory in these early-acquired (by monolinguals at least) SUBJ uses? Moreover, if children begin to express desires and beliefs about future events at a very young age and first-generation speakers (the input providers) still exhibit uniform usage in these SUBJ contexts, do child HSs follow along? If not, what factors modulate early SUBJ use? Flores et al. (2017) examined HS school-aged children acquiring various SUBJ contexts in European Portuguese and reported that acquisition is delayed compared to monolingual speakers and conditioned by exposure/ use of the HL. Unfortunately, there is no comparable study of Spanish SUBJ in school-aged HSs growing up in communities where the majority language is English (a language without extended SUBJ use) and in a context like the one found in central Texas.

Silva-Corvalán’s (2014) pioneering study with preschool children points in the right direction. She observed two English-dominant Spanish-English bilingual children—Nico and his younger brother Brennan (ages 1;06–5;11) growing up in California. Like the previous description of monolinguals, when Nico and Brennan are very young, they produce SUBJ forms (including the ones examined in the current study), but their use is not systematic. Nico is said to develop initially like a typical “monolingual child,” and an observational study on a few HS children ages 2–5 from Texas’s Rio Grande valley (i.e., near TexasMexico border) also suggests very early acquisition (González, 1978). However, Silva-Corvalán reports that innovative IND and alternative use still characterize Brennan’s mood selection, and he even exhibits a weakening command on some SUBJ uses. Silva-Corvalán argues that the differences in the two boys’ SUBJ use come down to a distinction between them. As time went on, more English was being spoken in the home and in other family situations, which decreased Brennan’s exposure to and proficiency in Spanish. Although this longitudinal study is trailblazing and suggestive, it does not break down results by type of SUBJ use, has only two participants, and, most importantly, does not encompass the school-aged years.

A few studies touch on school-aged HS children’s use of SUBJ with volitional clauses. Brisk (1972), using a sentence repetition task with seven New Mexican children (age 5), shows that some of these HSs changed the SUBJ in the sentence to an infinitive structure, which Brisk interprets as resulting from issues with subordination. Morgan, Restrepo & Auza (2013) employed a questionanswer task with volitional and directive predicates that categorically select SUBJ (including querer ‘to want’) and found that by age 5;03 Spanish-English bilingual children use SUBJ at a $6 4 \%$ rate, infinitives at $2 9 \%$ , and IND at $8 \%$ . No data on just the querer condition is provided, and no separate proficiency measure was administered. Using the Bilingual English Spanish Assessment (BESA) question-answer elicitation task (Peña et al. 2014), Rodriguez et al. (2017) reported that children in kindergarten selected the SUBJ at a rate of $3 5 \%$ with querer, and children in the first grade did so at $5 0 \%$ . Merino’s (1983) study used the Bilingual Language Acquisition Scale (Merino 1976) to test knowledge of the SUBJ among bilingual children from kindergarten through fourth grade with three delayed imitation items (one volitional with querer ‘to want,’ one purposive with para que ‘so that,’ and one dubitative with tal vez ‘maybe’). Although results are not reported by item, Merino found a reduction of SUBJ use between test $( 7 0 \% )$ and retest two years later $( 5 5 \% )$ . Note that the SUBJ use rates observed in these studies tend to be lower than those reported for adult HSs, and Merino suggests that these low rates are subject to attrition.

Only one study addresses child $\mathrm { H S s } ^ { \prime }$ acquisition of SUBJ with temporal adverbial clauses, and it is also the one study that administered a proficiency measure that was independent of the main task eliciting SUBJ use.4 Castilla Earls et al. (2018), examining bilingual children $( 4 ; 0 5 -$ 8;00), found that accuracy rates were $8 3 \%$ among Spanish-dominant children and $7 5 \%$ among balanced bilingual children. The authors interpret their results as suggesting no early effect of Spanish proficiency on SUBJ use with adverbials, which could emerge later due to “sustained reductions in language exposure” (p. 81). Therefore, where the research on HS children’s acquisition of mood selection with volitional clauses reports low rates of SUBJ and suggests the possibility of attrition, Castilla Earls et al. (2018) suggests high SUBJ usage rates in adverbial clauses and finds no effect of proficiency.

In short, there is no clear picture of the developmental trajectory of school-aged HS children’s Spanish SUBJ use with volitional or adverbial clauses, much less a clear picture of what may be conditioning that trajectory. This study aims to fill this gap by addressing the overarching question of how school-aged, second-generation HS children acquire SUBJ in two of the earliest acquired contexts by monolingual children (volitional clauses (querer) and adverbials (cuando, antes de). The three specific questions that guide our investigation are:

RQ1: Does SUBJ use by school-aged child HSs in some of the earliest acquired contexts (volitional and adverbial clauses) differ from that of monolingual children (examined in previous studies) and adult first-generation speakers (living in the same community as the child HSs)?   
RQ2: Do speaker factors such as age, language exposure/use, or Spanish and English morphosyntactic proficiency influence the acquisition of SUBJ in these contexts?   
RQ3: Does the modal difference between volitional clauses and adverbials influence their acquisition? Within epistemic modality, does cuando being variable affect their mood selection compared to the categorical antes de context?

Based on the research findings summarized thus far, we hypothesize that although there will be more optionality in SUBJ use among the child HSs as compared to mood selection by first-generation speakers in their community (whom we predict will use SUBJ near categorically), the children’s use of SUBJ will be relatively high in these early-acquired contexts. Compared to monolingual development in these contexts, we expect that we might find similar patterns, but that acquisition in these contexts could be delayed due to the reduced HL exposure and use that characterizes most childhood bilinguals even in the early years. That is, contrary to Merino’s (1983) findings of attrition and following those of Flores et al.

(2017) with Portuguese HSs, we expect to find an age effect and observe HSs (overall) progressing toward target-like SUBJ use in these contexts. However, we expect that there will be considerable variation among the group in the degree to which these HS children use SUBJ. Following Silva Corvalán (2014) and Flores et al. (2017), we expect SUBJ use to be conditioned by exposure and use in the HL. Additionally, following prior research on HS adults (Montrul 2009; Perez-Cortes 2021a; 2021b), we would expect that the child HSs’ morphosyntactic proficiency would be a strong predictor of their SUBJ use, perhaps particularly in the older children (see Castilla-Earls et al. 2018). From the perspective of cross-linguistic influence, proficiency in English (the majority language) could be expected to result in decreased SUBJ use in HL Spanish, since, unlike other Romance languages (or German, for example), the IND-SUBJ mood contrast is almost nonexistent in English. However, Silva-Corvalán’s (2014) comparison of Nico and Brennan during the preschool ages suggested it was crucially the reduced exposure to Spanish rather than direct influence from English that accounted for the difference in SUBJ use between the boys. Therefore, we do not anticipate a large effect for English morphosyntactic proficiency in our HS child participants.

Concerning the language-internal factors of the SUBJ, we expect that the modal distinction between SUBJ with volitional clauses and adverbials (deontic vs. epistemic) will have a small effect on the HSs’ SUBJ usage. Since adult HSs produce slightly higher rates of SUBJ following volitional clauses (deontic) as compared to adverbials (epistemic) and monolinguals tend to master SUBJ with volition (age 4–5) before adverbials (age 5–6), we expect to see the HS school-aged children do slightly better with volition. Next, although many have proposed that SUBJ production in variable contexts is more vulnerable than SUBJ use in categorical contexts, recent studies on adult HSs have shown no effect for variability when modality was controlled within deontic (Perez-Cortes 2021b) and epistemic (Lustres, García-Tejada & Cuza 2020) predicates. Therefore, we do not expect to find significant differences in the SUBJ rate between the adverbials cuando ‘when’ (which is variable) and antes de ‘before,’ which both fall within epistemic modality. Accordingly, we predict the effect of modality or variability on mood selection to be minimal and thus insufficient to account for the optionality we predict the child HSs to exhibit in these conditions. We instead propose that the primary drivers of increased optionality in the observed contexts are likely the speaker factors mentioned previously interacting with the language-internal factors common to all SUBJ contexts—availability in the input, morphosyntactic complexity, and low communicative value.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Participants

Fifty typically developing child HSs of Spanish ages 5;01–14;10 ( $M = 7 ; 5$ , $S D = 2 ; 0 6$ ) and 23 firstgeneration adults were recruited from a bilingual community in central Texas to participate in this study (see Table 2 for all participant information described in this section). The children were born in the United States, except for one child born in Mexico who arrived in the United States before 2;00. All child participants had at least one parent who migrated to the United States from Mexico $( 9 6 \% )$ or Honduras $( 4 \% )$ after age 15. All the first-generation adults lived in the same bilingual community as the children. These adults were born in Mexico and migrated to the United States after age 15 (mean length of residence in the United States was 14.6 years), and several of them $( n = 8 )$ ) were parents of some of the children tested $( n = 1 1 )$ ). The adult group was selected as the baseline because they are a primary source of input for the second-generation HS children, and previous research highlights the importance of comparison across bilingual groups living in the same community (e.g., Pascual y Cabo & Rothman 2012; Polinsky & Scontras 2020; Serratrice 2020).

A questionnaire was sent home with each child to be filled out by his or her parents (see Requena & Dracos 2021). Data collected from it were used to determine children’s estimated percentage of exposure to and use of English and Spanish outside school as well as the language spoken with particular family members. This information was then captured via separate 5-point Likert scales for (a) Language Exposure Outside of School, (b) Language Use Outside of School, and (c) Language Spoken with

\*One child HS was born in Mexico, but she moved to the United States before age 2;00 and had resided in the United States for almost eight years at the time of testing. \*\*The proficiency scores for the HS children are mean standardized proficiency scores expressed in terms of standard deviations.

Close Family and Friends. An additional Likert scale was created for (d) Current Exposure and Use at School. In these four Likert scales, higher scores indicate more Spanish exposure/use (see Appendix A in the Supplemental Materials for the complete scales).5 Since the scores for Exposure $M = 4 . 1 0$ , $S D = . 8 1$ ) and Use ( $M = 3 . 7 8$ , $S D = 1 . 0 1 $ ) were strongly correlated positively $[ r = . 7 7 , p < . 0 0 0 1 ]$ , we combined them into a Spanish Exposure and Use variable, following in Shin et al. (2019) (see “Mean Spanish Exposure/ Use” in Table 2). This mean score indicates that the average child tested was exposed to Spanish $5 0 \%$ of the time outside of school. The mean score for Language Spoken Close Family and Friends indicates that the average child spoke only Spanish or both languages with most members of the family and close friends (and speaks in English only with a minority of family members and close friends). In addition, the mean score for Spanish Exposure/Use in school (during last academic year) (d) indicates that the average child was exposed to Spanish half of the school day.6

We assessed morphosyntactic proficiency in English and Spanish by using the morphosyntactic subtest from the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment (BESA) (with child participants up to age 6;11) (Peña et al. 2014), and the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment—Middle Extension (BESA-ME) (with child participants ages 7 and up) (Peña et al. 2016).7 These standardized tests provide a valid and reliable measure of language ability in Spanish-English bilingual children. To establish a continuum of proficiency scores regardless of whether participants took the

BESA or the BESA-ME test, we standardized the children’s raw scores on their respective tests based on the national raw score means provided by the test creators. To accomplish this, we subtracted the mean for the appropriate age group of the national sample ( $n = 7 5 6$ for BESA; $\ n \ = \ 5 4 4$ for BESA-ME) from the participant’s score and then divided it by the standard deviation of the national scores. The result was a mean score of 0.63 $( S D ~ 2 . 8 4 )$ for English Proficiency (range: $- 3 . 3 7 \mathrm { - } 7 . 2 5 )$ and a mean score of $- 0 . 4 0$ $\left( S D \ 2 . 8 4 \right)$ for Spanish Proficiency (range: $- 6 . 0 4 \substack { - 6 . 1 2 } ,$ ). We, therefore, observed that overall the children display greater morphosyntactic proficiency in English than in Spanish, yet the range indicates considerable variability.8

Adult participants completed the Spanish translation of the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q) (Marian, Blumenfeld & Kaushanskaya 2007), which offered a self-reported measure of exposure/use and proficiency. Other proficiency measures were a Spanish proficiency test (adapted from a version of the DELE, a test designed by the Spanish Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte (Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sport, http://diplomas.cervantes.es/en) and an English proficiency measure (adapted from a version of MELICET, a test designed by the University of Michigan English Language Institute, http://www.michigan-proficiency-exams.com/melicet.html). The adult group reported using more and being more proficient in Spanish compared to English.

# 3.2. Materials and procedure

A sentence-completion task was adapted from Dracos, Requena & Miller (2019) to test mood selection use in three conditions, to which we will refer as (i) Volition (with querer ‘want’), (ii) Adverbials (with antes de ‘before’ and cuando ‘when’ with future meaning), and (iii) Control (with saber ‘know’). The first two conditions were designed to elicit categorical SUBJ continuations. The Control condition was designed to elicit IND continuations. There were four trials testing SUBJ use in the Volition condition and two testing IND use in the Control condition, adapted from Dracos, Requena & Miller (2019), by replacing lexical items with those used in the Mexican Spanish variety spoken within the community examined. We created six new trials for the Adverbial condition, four testing SUBJ use with antes de ‘before’ and two testing SUBJ use with cuando ‘when’ with future meaning (adapted from SánchezNaranjo & Pérez-Leroux 2010:240). A sample trial with antes de appears in Figure 3 (for sample trials with Volition and the Control condition, see Dracos, Requena & Miller 2019).

Parental consent and child assent were collected prior to testing child participants. The testing session began with unstructured conversation, which included playing time using Disney™ character figures with children ages 8 and under. After that, the experiment began with two practice trials that did not require mood selection and helped familiarize children with the task. Each experimental trial began with the experimenter showing a large color drawing depicting a situation involving two characters and introducing the situation to the participant. Next, the experimenter introduced a prompt that required participants to finish a sentence using a finite verb (either in the IND or SUBJ) to complete a subordinate clause. Although the participants could complete the sentence with any subordinate verb, the picture and prompt primed the use of specific verbs (see Figure 3). Within each condition, the participant chose the order of trials by selecting cards at random, which varied the order of presentation across participants. The procedure was identical for all participants.

We coded the data for type of sentence continuation response. Responses were coded as SUBJ (the expected response across the experimental conditions) or as an alternative response, which included present IND mood, an infinitive, future responses with va a ‘go to’ $^ +$ infinitive, as well as responses that lacked a verb or included an English verb. Semantic anomalies were very few and were kept in the data set, given that they mainly occurred in the alternative responses. The five cases of semantically

Figure 3. Sample trial.

This child likes jumping into pools, but this pool is very deep and he could drown. The mom sees that the child wants to jump and she rushes to grab him

# Prompt:

Completa lo que digo: La mama debe agarrar a su nino antes de que el nino...

Complete what I say: The mom must grab her son before the son...

Possible responses: \*salta-IND /salte-sUBJ a la piscina jumps into the pool.

anomalous responses with SUBJ involved negation with a SUBJ verb. Even though negation changes the interpretation of the sentence, the fact that SUBJ mood was used signaled that the participant knew the mood selection restrictions of the operator being tested. We therefore kept these trials in the data set.

# 4. Results

Table 3 presents the mean rate of SUBJ use for the first-generation adults and the HS children with each matrix verb/adverbial expression examined here. The first-generation adults produced SUBJ categorically following querer, antes de, and cuando with future events, as would be expected with monolinguals, and they produced only IND in the Control condition following saber. Since they performed at ceiling in the SUBJ conditions, we will not include the first-generation adults in the statistical analyses.

The child HSs demonstrated their ability to use IND when appropriate, evidenced by only a $5 \%$ rate of SUBJ use and $9 5 \%$ IND use in the Control condition with saber. However, the HS children as a whole used SUBJ at much lower rates than the categorical usage of the first-generation adults from their community. This was the case across the SUBJ conditions, although the mean rate of $5 8 \%$ SUBJ use for Volition (querer) was slightly higher than the $4 9 \%$ SUBJ use following Adverbials with futurity (antes de and cuando).

The rate of SUBJ use and the variability based on SDs were identical for the two adverbial operators. We therefore ran a chi-squared Pearson correlation test to determine the independence of antes de and cuando. The results showed a strong relationship between the two variables, $\chi 2 ( 1 , \ N \ : = \ : 3 0 0 ) \ : = \ : 0 . 9 3 5$ , $p \ = \ 0 . 0 0 6 7$ . Each cell of the two-way table has a $0 . 0 ~ \chi 2$ contribution to the statistic. Accordingly, there was no significant difference between antes de and cuando, and we will henceforth consider them together as one condition called “Adverbials.” The fact that these two predicates equally triggered the SUBJ is consistent with what has been found for adult HSs (Lustres, García-Tejada & Cuza 2020).

Notably, the large standard deviations in Table 3 indicate great variation in SUBJ use by the schoolaged HS children. Thus, we examine mood selection based on potentially important speaker factors. We ran generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a logit-link and binomial error distribution in IBM SPSS Statistics version 26 (with graphs outputted by Stata/SE version 15.1). The random effect structure included a random intercept for Participant and a crossed random effect for Trial. Since some models would not converge due to the crossed random effect of Trial, for consistency, Trial was removed from the random structure of all our models. We ran models with Condition (Volition and Adverbials) and the following predictor variables: Age (in months), Language Exposure and Use Outside of School, Language Exposure and Use in School, Language Spoken with Close Family and Friends, English Proficiency, and Spanish Proficiency. We entered predictors as well as all viable interactions into the models in a stepwise manner and excluded any that were nonsignificant and did not improve the model fit based on model comparison tests using Akaike information criterion [AIC] and Bayesian information criterion [BIC].

Results revealed Spanish Proficiency and Spanish Exposure and Use Outside School to be key predictors of SUBJ use by the HS children. The other variables examined (Age,9 English proficiency, Spanish Exposure and Use in school, and Language Spoken with Close Family and Friends) were all nonsignificant in models that included them and did not improve model fit. The two best-fit models included Spanish Proficiency and Condition in one model, and in the other Exposure/Use Outside of School and Condition. When we ran a model including both Spanish Proficiency and Exposure/Use Outside of School, we found these two variables confounding. In addition, the AIC/BIC values revealed two separate models to be a much better fit. Although not strongly correlated $( r = . 3 6 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ ), the confound attested between Spanish Proficiency and Spanish Exposure/Use Outside School could mean that these two factors may have the same relationship to the dependent variable (SUBJ use). Although the two variables are related, there is value in analyzing the role of each factor separately, given the distinct insights each can provide. Although Spanish Proficiency is a more objective measure of global morphosyntactic ability, Language Exposure and Use reflects the HS children’s communicative preferences and ability in the HL during everyday interaction with family and friends. To be able to compare the odds ratios of these two variables to see the relative impact of these two measures of HL ability on the dependent variable when run in separate models, we $z \cdot$ -standardized (group mean centered) them before running the models. The model results are summarized in the following, and we provide the complete output in Appendix B of the Supplemental Materials.

The model including Spanish Proficiency and Condition revealed a significant main effect for Spanish Proficiency, $F ( 1 , 7 8 ) = 4 1 . 5 8 , p < . 0 0 1$ , and for Condition, $F ( 1 , 4 9 7 ) = 5 . 9 7 , p = . 0 1 5 .$ . There was no interaction between Spanish Proficiency and Condition included in this best-fit model, as it was nonsignificant and removed from the prior model that included it. Regarding the effect of Condition, the estimated odds ratio (OR) is 1.77 $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 1 . 1 2 , 2 . 8 0 )$ , which indicates that a participant is 1.77 times more likely to produce SUBJ in the Volition condition than in the Adverbials condition. Moreover, regardless of the condition, increased Spanish Proficiency strongly corresponds to increased SUBJ use. Specifically, the OR is 5.63 ( $9 5 \%$ $\mathrm { C I } = 3 . 3 0 $ , 9.59). In other words, a participant is 5.63 times more likely to produce the SUBJ for each standard deviation increase in Spanish Proficiency. This result shows a large effect size for Spanish Proficiency.10 The rather wide CI for this OR is potentially reflective of the considerable variability in performance.

The model including Exposure and Use Outside of School and Condition revealed a significant main effect for Exposure/Use, $F ( 1 , 4 0 ) = 6 . 6 8$ , $p = . 0 1 4 $ , and for Condition, $F ( 1 , 4 9 7 ) = 5 . 8 4 $ , $p = . 0 1 6$ . There was no interaction between Exposure/Use and Condition included in this optimal model, as it was nonsignificant and removed from the prior model that included it. For Condition, the OR is 1.75 $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 1 . 1 1 , 2 . 7 5 )$ , indicating the same increased likelihood found in the previous model of producing SUBJ with Volition than with Adverbials. Concerning Spanish Exposure/Use, the OR is 2.05 $( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 1 . 1 7 , 3 . 5 9 )$ , which means a participant is 2.05 times more likely to produce the SUBJ (regardless of Condition) for each standard deviation increase in Spanish Exposure/Use. This result shows a medium effect size for Spanish Exposure/Use. Thus, if we compare these two reported models, we see that while both Spanish Proficiency and Spanish Exposure/Use influence SUBJ production, Spanish Proficiency has a greater effect on the likelihood of the child HSs producing the SUBJ.

To further elucidate the role of Spanish Proficiency and Exposure/Use, we divided the participants into categorical groups based on their Spanish morphosyntactic proficiency (High-, Mid-, and LowProficiency) and on their exposure to and use of Spanish (High-, Mid-, Low-Exposure/Use).11 Using these groups we then: (i) compared SUBJ use between the child HS groups and the first-generation adults, and (ii) explored response types across groups as well as individual tendencies of participants in each of the groups.

To address (i), we followed a similar procedure to that outlined previously to first find the best-fit model containing the categorical predictor Spanish-Proficiency groups and then the best-fit model containing the categorical predictor Exposure/Use groups. The only difference in procedure is that all models run included one of the variables already found to condition SUBJ use when examined continuously. The best-fit model containing the categorical Spanish-Proficiency group variable revealed a significant main effect for this predictor, $F ( 2 , 4 5 ) = 2 0 . 3 6$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , and as with the models reported above, the main effect for Condition was significant, $F ( 1 , 4 9 6 ) = 5 . 9 6 $ , $p = . 0 1 5$ . Also consistent with the models reported previously, all other predictors were excluded from the final model as they did not improve the model fit and were nonsignificant in models that included them. Pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni adjustment indicated that the High-Proficiency group displayed a greater probability of producing SUBJ compared to both the Mid-Proficiency group (Contrast estimate ${ } ^ { 1 2 } = . 3 1$ $S E = . 0 9$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $9 5 \%$ ${ \mathrm { 6 } } \mathrm { C I } = 0 . 1 2 ,$ 0.50) and the Low-Proficiency group (Contrast estimate $= . 7 0$ , $S E = . 0 7$

$< . 0 0 1 , 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = 0 . 5 3 , 0 . 8 7 )$ , and the Mid-Proficiency group displayed a greater probability of producing SUBJ than the Low-Proficiency group (Contrast estimate $= . 3 9$ , $S E = . 1 0$ , $p = . 0 0 1$ , $9 5 \%$ CI $= 0 . 1 5$ , 0.63). See Figure 4.

The best-fit model containing categorical Exposure/Use groups revealed that this predictor was not significant, although it only slightly exceeded the significance cutoff, $F ( 2 , 3 8 ) = 3 . 2 2$ , $p = . 0 5 1$ . As with the models reported previously, the only other predictor included in the best-fit model was Condition, which was significant, $F ( 1 , 4 9 6 ) = 5 . 8 6 , p = . 0 1 6 .$ Pairwise comparisons with the Bonferroni adjustment indicated that SUBJ use was not significantly different between the High-Exp/Use and Mid-Exp/Use children (Contrast estimate $= . 0 8$ , $S E = . 1 4$ , $p = . 5 7 7$ , $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = - . 2 1 ,$ .37), but the High-Exp/Use group produced SUBJ significantly more than the Low-Exp/Use children (Contrast estimate $= . 4 1$ , $S E = . 1 5$ , $\dot { p } = . 0 2 4 , 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } = . 0 4 , . 7 9 )$ . The Mid-Exp/Use children did not produce significantly more SUBJ than the Low-Exp/Use children, but the difference did approach significance (Contrast estimate $\qquad = \ . 3 3$ , $S E = . 1 6$ , $ { p } = . 0 8 4$ , $9 5 \%$ ${ \mathrm { ~  ~ \Gamma ~ } } ) { \mathrm { ~ C I } } = - . 0 4 ,$ .70). See Figure 5.

Based on the predicted probabilities of SUBJ use by the High-Proficiency and High-Exp/Use groups in Figures 4 and 5, it is clear that the High-Proficiency child HS group most closely approximated the categorical SUBJ usage by first-generation adults from the same community. The picture is less clear with Exposure/Use. We only see group differences for the Low-Exp/Use group, and the Mid- and High-Exp/Use groups’ predicted probability of SUBJ use was not as high as that of the High-Prof group.

To elucidate comparisons between the child HS groups based on Proficiency and Exposure/Use and to the first-generation adults, Tables 4 and 5 provide the rates of SUBJ use and alternative responses for each group per condition (point ii).

Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the distribution of responses across the child HS groups (based on Spanish Proficiency and Exposure/Use). Note that all non-SUBJ responses produced by HS children involved the use of forms considered ungrammatical in these conditions in monolingual Spanish. The vast majority $( > 8 0 \% )$ of the High-Proficiency group’s responses in both conditions were SUBJ (as noted in model results). When those in this High-Proficiency group did not use the SUBJ, they predominantly produced present IND, with only a few instances of infinitive use (Volition condition) and No verb (Adverbials). The SUBJ use rate decreased significantly in the

Note. The number of participants in each group were as follows: Low Exposure/Use $( n = 1 3 )$ ); Mid Exposure/Use $( n = 1 8 )$ ; High Exposure/Use $( n = 1 9 )$ ); First-generation adults $( n = 2 3 )$ ).

Mid-Prof and then Low-Prof groups, and these groups also produced an increased number of alternative responses when they did not use the SUBJ. The pattern was particularly evident in the Low-Proficiency group, where $2 6 \% { - } 2 8 \%$ of responses in each condition consisted of forms other than SUBJ or IND.

Turning to the distribution of responses across the Exposure/Use groups, we see a notable difference across the two conditions. Within the High-Exposure/Use group, a large majority $( 7 0 \% )$ of the responses in the Volition condition consist of the SUBJ. On the other hand, the High-Exposure/ Use group uses the SUBJ only a little over half of the time in the adverbials condition. There is not a remarkable decrease in SUBJ use from High- to Mid-Exposure/Use for both conditions; nor is there much increase in the types of alternative responses the participants in these groups entertain (most are present IND). In the Low-Exposure/Use group, however, the rate of SUBJ use drops substantially in both conditions, and we see a notable increase in non-IND alternative responses used, particularly infinitives, English verb forms, or lack of a verb entirely.

To examine the individual variation within groups, we conducted an individual analysis for the Spanish Proficiency groups and the Exposure/Use groups (same groups as previous). The objective was to compare how many children in each group used SUBJ categorically versus optionally versus not at all in each condition. See Figures 6 and 7.

As seen in Figure 6, the majority of the High-Proficiency HS children used SUBJ categorically in both conditions, appearing identical to the first-generation adults. With Volition, 12/15 HighProficiency children produced SUBJ categorically, and 10/15 did so in the Adverbials condition. Only one High-Proficiency child in each condition produced no SUBJ, and the remaining few produced it optionally across the trials. In the Mid-Proficiency group, the majority of the children are variably producing SUBJ across the trials in both conditions, but some in this group are target-like producing SUBJ categorically, especially with Volition (6/17). In contrast, none of the Low-Proficiency children are using SUBJ categorically with Volition or Adverbials; the majority are using it optionally, and about a third of the group is not using it at all.

Figure 7 reveals that, even among the group with the highest Spanish exposure and use, less than half of the HS children produced SUBJ categorically in the Volition condition $( 4 7 \% )$ and less than a third with Adverbials $( 3 2 \% )$ . We see only minor differences in individual tendencies between the High- and Mid-Exposure/Use groups, with a large percentage of participants using SUBJ optionally in this condition and a few not using it at all. The most noteworthy difference between these groups and the group with the lowest Spanish exposure/use is that only one child in this group uses SUBJ categorically, with the vast majority using it optionally and almost a third of the group not using any SUBJ at all across the trials in each condition.

The results presented here indicate an association between SUBJ use in the two conditions examined (Volition and Adverbials) and overall morphosyntactic proficiency. Individual variance in morphosyntactic proficiency also correlates with rates of SUBJ use. Our sample results indicate that some child HSs resemble the first generation in SUBJ use, while others differ from their input. The HS children with the lowest overall proficiency in the heritage language treated SUBJ as optional or not required in the conditions tested here. Spanish Exposure and Use showed a similar, albeit weaker, association to SUBJ use compared to Spanish Proficiency. These results held for both conditions: Volition with querer and Adverbials with futurity. Other factors explored here (such as age and English proficiency) did not significantly affect SUBJ use by the HS children in our sample. Therefore, the main finding is that variance in SUBJ use is conditioned strongly by morphosyntactic command of and experience using the heritage language.

# 5. Discussion and conclusion

This study examined HS children’s mood selection in two of the earliest acquired Spanish SUBJ contexts—SUBJ of volition with querer and SUBJ of futurity with adverbials antes de and cuando, all in the present tense. As predicted, the first-generation adults exhibited categorical SUBJ usage in these conditions. On the other hand, the HS children produced considerably lower SUBJ rates with volition $( 5 8 \% )$ and adverbials $( 4 9 \% )$ . However, this general, overall finding obscures many important patterns of use that are only observable when we consider differences among participants.

First, the overall findings underline the common observation that HSs can differ greatly from one another. There was wide variance among the observed HS children. On one extreme, we find some approaching or achieving target-like, categorical usage of the SUBJ in these conditions. On the other extreme, some do not use the SUBJ, using the IND or other less frequent alternative responses (infinitive, periphrastic future, no verb, or an English verb) instead. In between, we find the majority who sometimes use the SUBJ and other times use alternative responses, mainly the present IND. Therefore, for most child HSs in this study, their SUBJ rate and use patterns are comparable to those of monolingual children ages 2–3.

Further, the older HS children in this study were no more or less likely to select the SUBJ than the younger children. There was no effect of age. Contrary to Merino (1983), in the two conditions tested here, we see no direct evidence that the child HSs (as a whole) are moving away from target-like usage (i.e., attrition). Moreover, contrary to Flores et al.’s (2017) findings with Portuguese HSs and our prediction, we see no direct evidence that the child HSs are moving toward target-like usage (i.e., delayed acquisition). However, with a larger sample size of older child HSs (our study only included $n = 1 0$ children aged 10 or older), we might find, like Flores et al. (2017) does for child HSs of European Portuguese, a developmental trend during these later school-aged years. Nonetheless, where monolinguals become adult-like in these conditions around age 5, we observe that wide variance in the HS children’s mood selection is already present during the earliest school-aged years, which suggests that the variance among them emerged at a very young age (Silva-Corvalán 2014). Further, this wide variance among the child HSs appears to persist up to the later school-aged years tested.

In addition, this study examined various factors that could be conditioning the HS children’s SUBJ use in interacting with relevant features of the SUBJ contexts. First, like Silva-Corvalán (2014), we found that increased English proficiency did not affect task performance (see similar results about relative proficiency between English and Spanish in Castilla-Earls et al. 2021). Therefore, our study does not provide direct evidence for cross-linguistic influence from English. Instead, SUBJ use seems to develop independently from English proficiency.

Next, our study found that within epistemic modality, fixed selection of SUBJ with antes de did not result in increased SUBJ use compared to variable selection with cuando. This finding is consistent with Lustres, García-Tejada & Cuza (2020) and Perez-Cortes (2021b), who report no effect of variability for adult HSs in either epistemic or deontic modality contexts respectively. However, this study suggests that school-aged HS children exhibit slightly but still significantly more optionality within epistemic modality than deontic modality. Although very young monolingual Spanish-speaking children have the cognitive ability to grasp and express deontic modality before epistemic modality using the SUBJ mood, their facility with the latter catches up to the former by around age 5. In the present study, however, the HS children’s ability to instantiate epistemic modality through the SUBJ does not catch up to their productive command of SUBJ in deontic modality. Given that child HSs of the ages tested here have the cognitive ability to grasp the modality in both constructs and given our null finding for variability within epistemic modality, we hypothesize that SUBJ use with volitional clauses, which is common and occurs earlier than SUBJ with adverbials, may become more entrenched during the preschool years and before the child $\mathrm { H S s } ^ { \prime }$ language environment shifts. In line with Perez-Cortes’s (2021b) findings for adult HSs, our study suggests that modality, more so than variability, is an important factor in child HSs’ development of mood selection in the contexts examined here.

However, the majority of the variance among the child HSs in this study corresponds to two other factors. Similar to the findings in Flores et al. (2017) with school-age children acquiring European Portuguese and Silva-Corvalán’s (2014) with preschool children acquiring Spanish as a HL, this study found a significant effect of Spanish exposure/use on SUBJ production. The effect was especially notable among those with low exposure/use, who used the SUBJ the least and displayed the greatest array of alternative responses. Next, like prior research that found variance among HS children’s tense and aspect development (e.g., Anderson 2001; Requena & Dracos 2021; Silva-Corvalán 2003), this study found wide variance in the HS children’s morphosyntactic proficiency and reveals that this variance corresponds strongly with a large variance in their SUBJ use. Indeed, a one standard deviation increase in Spanish morphosyntactic proficiency corresponded to an almost six times greater likelihood of producing the SUBJ overall, regardless of condition. This suggests that general morphosyntactic proficiency is critical for child HS development in the SUBJ. This finding supports research proposing a crucial role for proficiency in modulating adult Spanish HSs’ mood selection in deontic predicates, with alternative options increasing as HL proficiency decreases (Perez-Cortes 2021a; 2021b; Perez-Cortes, Putnam & Sánchez 2019). The present study illustrates that the strong relationship between proficiency and mood-selection is already apparent in child HSs and then seems to persist up to adulthood. Therefore, we conclude that, in general, there is a strong connection between HSs’ exposure/use and, more so, proficiency in the HL and their SUBJ use in the observed early-acquired contexts. Two points, we believe, follow from these findings concerning exposure/use and morphosyntactic proficiency. First, the observed wide variance of exposure/use and morphosyntactic proficiency among the child participants suggests no “typical” HL environment for HS children in central TX. Following Montrul & Polinsky (2019), it is probable that even within this same central Texas community, differences in linguistic practices at home or within social networks, affective or attitudinal factors, or sociopolitical and ideological influences condition HL exposure/use and thus acquisition of the Spanish SUBJ. Therefore, there is a need for research that closely investigates how such factors condition exposure and use and ultimately HL development within and across HS populations (see also López-Beltrán & Carlson 2020).

Second, since only some structures are vulnerable in heritage language acquisition, why do differences in HL environment yield such variation in SUBJ use in even some of the earliest acquired SUBJ contexts? As argued, relative to the IND and other morphosyntactic phenomena, even these relatively easier SUBJ contexts are less available in the input, are morphosyntactically complex, and have low communicative value. Our study suggests that the majority of observed HSs are not receiving sufficient input with the target structures or not developing sufficient morphosyntactic knowledge to master mood selection in even some of the earliest-acquired SUBJ contexts. Like very young monolingual children generally, the majority of the HS children seem to express modality in accordance with the grammatical means available to them and continue frequently to use the IND or alternative means (e.g., infinitive, imperative, a phrase without a verb, an English verb) to express modality.

As we see it, the findings of this study suggest that Silva-Corvalán’s (2014) longitudinal study on Nico and Brennan (ages 1;06–5;11) is playing out in a larger cross-sectional sample of child HSs in central Texas. A minority are like Nico and develop initially like monolinguals. Early on, they express indirect commands or desires and beliefs about future events (modality) with some SUBJ, IND, and other alternative ways. This group of child HSs’ language environment tends to surround them with the HL during the early years and thus provides adequate exposure to the target structures and fosters the morphosyntactic knowledge needed to process and produce them. In turn, they achieve (or nearly achieve) baseline-like, categorical SUBJ usage in the examined contexts in or around the early school years. Most of the child HSs ages 5–14, however, look like Brennan. They, this study suggests, have not been surrounded by as much Spanish. Through a combination of not receiving enough exposure to Spanish overall and to the SUBJ in the examined contexts, and by not developing high overall morphosyntactic proficiency, they do not conform to the first-generation baseline and produce SUBJ categorically in the relevant grammatical contexts. Unlike monolinguals or the highproficiency child HSs, they do not seem to develop out of the tendency to variably express modality with SUBJ, IND, and other alternatives.

Although this study suggests the possibility of divergent acquisition by some HS children, this is only one side of the interpretive coin. Recall that the children in this study are still communicating with others in Spanish, and they must be communicating modality to one another. Indeed, as Serratrice (2020) acknowledges is often the case, the child HSs in this study also receive input from other second- and third-generation HSs. Therefore, if the results of this study are representative, there is a growing population of HSs who resort to innovative IND uses or alternative means to express deontic or epistemic modality. Where once volition (querer) and adverbials with future reference (antes de and cuando) uniformly selected SUBJ, we would now see widespread optionality and unpredictability as the norm. Following Viner (2016), it may be that HSs in central TX are in the process of creating a sort of variable mood grammar for SUBJ with volition and adverbials.

In conclusion, it is correct to say that the Spanish SUBJ is extremely vulnerable in a HL context because this study shows that even some of the most straightforward and early-acquired SUBJ uses are vulnerable or subject to language change in heritage language acquisition. Our study on SUBJ with volitional and adverbial clauses shows that child HSs in central Texas exhibit lower overall SUBJ use rates, where the majority’s way of expressing modality in these contexts resembles that of very young monolingual children, and there is vast variance among the HSs in terms of mood selection. We have argued that these phenomena are not primarily explained by the SUBJ’s modal character or potential variability. Instead, most HSs do not receive sufficient input in the target structures or develop sufficient morphosyntactic knowledge to push them away from the tendency to use IND or alternatives to express modality. This dynamic will be generalizable to all SUBJ contexts. For any SUBJ context, high levels of optionality, distinct patterns of use, and vast variance in mood selection among HSs can result from an interaction between the HL environment and linguistic factors present in all SUBJ contexts: relatively lower availability in the input, morphosyntactic complexity, and low communicative value. Therefore, in addition to examining what effect modality or subtle variability may have on mood selection, future research should: (i) examine speaker, environmental, and social factors that may predict the frequency of the SUBJ in the HL; and (ii) attempt to articulate the precise sort of morphosyntactic knowledge that is needed to develop the SUBJ mood successfully.

# Appendix A: Language exposure/use items in background questionnaire

The child’s score for Language spoken with particular family members was determined as follows:

(1) Speaks Spanish or both languages with only one person (with the majority they speak only English) $= 1$ point.   
(2) Speaks Spanish or both languages with less than half of the members of the family (with the majority the child speaks only English) $= 2$ points.   
(3) Speaks only Spanish or both languages with most members of the family (with the remaining minority the child speaks only English) $= 3$ points.   
(4) Speaks only Spanish or both languages with all members of the family $= 4$ points.   
(5) Speaks only Spanish with all members of the family $= 5$ points.13

The variables Language exposure outside school and Language use outside school were assigned a score as follows:

(1) Average Spanish heard/used is $0 \% { - } 1 9 \%$ on weekdays/weekends $= 1$ point.   
(2) Average Spanish heard/used is $2 0 \% { - } 3 9 \%$ on weekdays/weekends $= 2$ points.   
(3) Average Spanish heard/used is $4 0 \% - 5 9 \%$ on weekdays/weekends $= 3$ points.   
(4) Average Spanish heard/used is $6 0 \% { - } 7 9 \%$ on weekdays/weekends $= 4$ points.   
(5) Average Spanish heard/used is $8 0 \% { - } 1 0 0 \%$ on weekdays/weekends $= 5$ points.

The variable Current exposure and use of Spanish at school was assigned a score as follows:

(1) $5 \% { - } 1 9 \%$ of the school day spent exposed to or using Spanish $= 1$ point.   
(2) $2 0 \% { - } 3 9 \%$ of the school day spent exposed to or using Spanish $= 2$ points.   
(3) $4 0 \% - 5 9 \%$ of the school day spent exposed to or using Spanish $= 3$ points.   
(4) $6 0 \% { - } 7 9 \%$ of the school day spent exposed to or using Spanish $= 4$ points.   
(5) $8 0 \%$ or more of the school day spent exposed to or using Spanish $= 5$ points.
