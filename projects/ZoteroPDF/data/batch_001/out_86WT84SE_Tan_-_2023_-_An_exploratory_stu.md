This study explores how English as a Second Language (ESL) students make reference to outside sources and incorporate textual repetition using multimodal resources in a video project. ESL students' source use and citation practices have been studied extensively in the context of traditional text-based writing. However, little attention is paid to the issue of making citations in multimodal writing, despite the fact that multimodal writing has been a popular topic in recent decades. The current study bridges this gap by analyzing the cases of multimodal citation in 14 videos created by ESL students in a first-year composition course, accompanied by insights from two students. The analysis yields three patterns of incorporating sources--concurrently afforded, verbally afforded, and visually afforded citations--that employ different combinations of visual and audio resources. Direct quotations are incorporated as part of the narration as well as the visual representation. These multimodal citations and quotations fulfill three broad rhetorical functions: attribution, exemplification, and establishing links between sources. There is also evidence of knowledge transfer across genre and cultural boundaries. This study provides insights into how modal affordances could be leveraged to acknowledge propositional content in creative and rhetorically effective ways. It provides pedagogical ideas for designing multimodal assignments to engage students in the critical discussion of audience, intertextuality, and discourse community.

# 1. Introduction

A salient feature of academic writing i the systematic way of indicating intertextuality, as academic writers not only producetext that \*plausibly represents an external reality," but also use language \*to acknowledge, construct, and negotiate social relations" (Hyland, 2005, p. 173). Explicit reference to prior literature is of vital importance in academic writing because it signifies how a text depends on and contributes to the colaborative construction of knowledge (Hyland, 1999). In addition, acknowledging precedent works also helps the writer establish ethos and display the identity as a legitimate member of a discourse community (Hyland, 199)

In recent decades, "writing" has been conceptualized broadly to include the use of a wide variety of semiotic resources, as communication nowadays is often mediated by various digital tols and a wide range of semiotic resources (Yancey, 2004). Writing teachers, driven by the multimodal turn of composition, have thus designed pedagogical activities that encourage language learners to make the full use of semiotic power (Yi, 2017). While previous studies have shown that English as a Second Language (ESL) students are skillful at mobilizing multimodal resources to construct agument, negotiate identitie, and engage audiences (Cimasko & Shin,

2017; Cummins et al., 2015; Haner, 2015), it i not clear how they draw on available resources to indicate intertextual relationships and acknowledge the use of outside sources in their multimodal works. Of course, reference-making is not always a necessty in multimodal composing; some genres, such as digital storytelling, are primarily concerned with developing a personal voice through narrative (Bloch, 2018; OSskoz & Elola, 2016). But in argument-based multimodal asignments where students are expected to draw on various sources (e.g., Howell, 2018), neglecting the issue of making references might encourage uncritical or even unethical text-borrowing practices. Examining such an issue in the context of multimodal composition also contributes to the discussion of authorship and inertextuality in digital ommunication (Belcher, 2001, 2023). Taking a social semiotic perspective (Kres, 2003), this study investigates how the citation' practices, including the use of direct quotations, are realized in 14 proposal videos created by first-year ESL students in a five-week multimodal project..

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. ESL students' citation practices in traditional academic writing

One of the most extensively explored topics in the field of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) s students' citation practice, as it plays an important role in determining the successof ESL students academic writing. Following proper citation practices could help minimize the risk of plagiarism (Cumming et al., 2016). The use of ctation as a social practice also indicates the degree to which a writer has been successfully socialized into the academic discourse community (Friedman, 2019).

Previous studies examining the citation features by ESL students have focused on the forms and functions of citations and the use of reporting vers (.., Le et al., 2018). Two of the frequently studied citation features are integral and non-integral citations (Swales, 1990. The former incorporates the name of cited authors in the citing sentence, while the ltter downplays such information by putting cited authors in parentheses or replacing them with superscript numbers (Swales, 1990). Choosing betwen integral and non-integral structures ist decide whether it is the author or the message that needs to be emphasized (Hyland, 199; Samraj, 2013; Swales, 2014). These citations fulfil a wide range of rhetorical functions, the most frequent of which include attribution, exemplifi cation, evaluation, and statement of purpose (Lee et al., 2018; Petric, 2007; Samraj, 2013). Reporting verbs have also received much attention in research, as they can indicate the writer's epistemological assumptions and their stance toward the reported message (Hyland, 1999; Swales, 2014).

Previous studies have shown that students of different skill levels tend to demonstrate different patterns of indicating source use. For example, Lee e al.'s (2018) study on first-year ESL students suggested that integral citations were favored over non-integral ones, while Mansourizadeh and Ahmad's research (2011) on final-year master students in chemical engineering showed quite the opposite. Nevertheless, these studies have all agreed that the use of "author $^ +$ reporting verb' is prevalent in students' writing and that the dominant function of citation is to indicate attribution (Lee et al., 2018; Lombardi, 2021; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011).

Research looking into the use of reporting verbs has shown that inexperienced ESL writers tend to have a narrow selection of vocabulary, one that overlaps lttle with expert writers lexical repertoire (Lee et al., 2018; Liardet & Black, 2019; Lombardi, 2021). Lombardi's research (2021) on writers of four proficiency levels suggests that advanced writers tend to select a wider range of reporting vers and develop a more \*writerly" way of expressing their ealuation of the cited materials. Previous research has shown that the development of academic writing entails not only expanding one's vocabulary repertoire but als fostering a keen awareness of when and how to use certain words (Liardet & Black, 2019; Lombardi, 2021).

Lastly, the use of direct quotations by ESL writers has also atracted some research attention. Studies have shown that direct quotation is acommon practice among ESL students of allevel (Le et al., 2018; Lombardi, 2021), with advanced writers quoting more frequently and integrating shorter egments of source materials into their own writing (Lombardi, 2021; Petric, 2012). On the other hand, beginner writer tend to quote longer texts and demonstrat  poorer command ofeffctively framing the quoted materials (Docherty, 2019; Liardet & Black, 2019; Wang, 2016). Overal, the litrature has shown that citing properly proves to be a major challenge of academic writing for ESL students, partl because ESL students are imited in their linguistc abilities to indicate the nuances in atitude, stance, and engagement (Cumming et al., 2016; Leet al., 2018; Luzon, 2015). Another potential source of challengi the cultural dfferences that inflence how studnts perceive the rhetorical situation and how they nact writing strategies to solve the problem (Wang, 2016).

# 2.2. Citations in multimodal contexts

With the increasing use of digital tools and media in academic communication, scholars have called for greater attntion to the emergent multimodal genres and practces that draw on a broad range of semiotic resources to convey meanings (OHalloran et al. 2016), such as video method article (e.g., JoVE) and video abstract (e.g., CellPres). Encouraged by the changes in academic communication, many teachers have adopted a multimodal approach o writing pedagogy that allows students to make the ful use of their semiotic toolkit (Belcher, 2017; Yi et al., 2020).

In teaching multimodal composition, some teachers have observed the ways in which students appropriate textual materials in their multimodal work (Gynne & Bagga-Gupta, 2015; Tan, 2023; Zacharias, 2021). Gynne and Bagga-Gupta (2015) reported that some students used the same sentences from textboo in their presentations and animated videos without indicating the sources. Zacharias (2021) noticed that the focal participant, a first-year ESL speaker, copied directly from online texts in constructing her multimodal argument design without making necessary adjustments or atribution. Perhaps not coincidentall, Tan (2023) observed simila source use behaviors among her ESL students who were tasked to create a video, with one student demonstrating different attitudes toward the use of sources in different assgnments. Such behaviors are interpreted by Gynne and Bagga-Gupta (2015) as "a form of entex. tualization and remiotization that features the "relocalization of linguistic and multimodal resources from different sources ino a task-as-finished product (p. 521). Nevertheless these observations also raise the question of whether the concepts of authorship and ownership should be reconceptualized in a digital context where the interaction between reader, writer, and text has been revolutionized by the introduction of modal hybridity (Belcher, 2023; Mirovic et al., 2019).

While the empirical studies on reference-making in the multimodal context are scant, several second language writing scholars have expressed the need for such an inquiry. umming et al. (2016) argued that the act of writing from sources should be viewed at the multimodal level as it frequently involves the interaction with multimodal sources of information. On the same note, Bloch (2021) proposed that images used in making arguments nd to be acknowledged by generating a lit of "references" at the end of a video, as a way of compensating for the lack of explicit mentioning of creators' names..

The current study intends to bridge the gap by exploring how various semiotic resources are orchestrated to make reference to outside sources in multimodal texts created by ESL students. More specifially, this qualitatie study seeks to answer three research questions: 1) How are the uses of outside sources acknowledged in the proposal videos created by ESL students? 2) How are direct quotations incorporated in the proposal videos created by ESL students?3) What rhetorical functions are fulfilled by the use of multimodal citations and quotations? By analyzing the multimodal citation patterns, hope to demonstrate the creative ways of using multimodal resource to navigate the networks of onine texts. In light f th findings, I ill discuss how multimodal asignments could be designed to facilitate the learning of source use and citation.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Data collection

The multimodal texts analyzed in this study were produced by ESL writers enrolled in a first-year composition course at a large state university (pseudonym:  University). The five-week multimodal project, designed by the researcher as part of a dissertation project, aims at fulfilling the learning outcomes endorsed by the XU writing program, which emphasizes critical thinking, rhetorical knowledge, and composing processes. In this multimodal project, students were asked to produce a three to 5-min video, in which they identify a sustainabilit issue on campus and propose solutions. Video is chosen as the medium for multimodal composition becase it allows students to have in-depth conversations with the audience (Yeh et al., 2020). This video project was placed in between two other writing projects and was taught by an experienced ESL writing teacher Ajay (pseudonym).

To help studentsccesully create the video, various assgnments were put in place the scaffold the learning process. Students started by analyzing Vox videos' on YouTube that advocate for a more sustainable lfestyle. Students were also guided through the processof brainstorming ideas and collecting information from the internet. They were then tasked to find credible online sources and complete an annotated bibliography asignment. Before students set out to create videos, they were introduced to the storyboard template (Table 1) that was intended to help them manage the video-making proces. Throughout the project, students received feedback from the instructor and their peers. Instructor feedack was provided in face-to-face individual conferences while peer feedback was facilitated by the use of a peer-review worksheet. Both focused on content, language use, structure, and rhetorical appeals. In addition, workshops focusing on video-editing skills were held to help students tackle technological issues.

It is important to note that there were no explicit instructions on how to acknowledge the use of outside sources in videos, since such an issue was sparsely discussed in the literature of multimodal writing and thus not brought to the atention of the researcher While designing the assgnment. At the time when the video project was designed, citation practices were not part of the pedagogical focus. Instead, emphasis was placed on developing rhetorical awareness conducting online research, and practicing persuasive skil. The instructor Ajay has encouraged students to include a list of references at the end of the video but faiing to do so wil not result in any penalty. Al 17 students enrolled in the course have ucessully submitted their videos, 14 of which agreed to contribut heir works to this study. The length of these videos varied from 59 seconds to 7 minutes and 21 seconds. Although limited in size, the 14 videos are varied enough to demonstrate the different ways of making citations in multimodal texts.

To gain a better insight, students were invited to an online interview about their citation practices in the video. Two students (S5 and S8) agreed to take the interview, during which they were directed to watch their own videos and explain in English the design features and intentions behind each citation instance. They were also asked about their general approach to multimodal citation and other unidentified cases of source use. The two recorded interviews lasted 20 minutes and 23 minutes respectively.

# 3.2. Data analysis

The data analysis was divided into three stages: identifying citation cases, multimodal transcribing, and qualitative coding. First all citation segments in the videos were identified. In the context of traditional writing, citations can be identified by the use of extratextual tools (i.e, parenthesis and quotation marks) based on a set of formal citation systems. In the multimodal writing context, when such a system is asent and when the different media and modes support diferent ways of meaning-making, a renewed definition needs to be developed. In this study, multimodal citation refers to the atribution of propositional content to another source using visual and/or audio signal. The direct quotation refers to the verbatim use of others words in voice-over narration and/or visual representation. For video segment to be considered a citation/quotation, it has to show the designer's attempt to attribut the ideas and/or language to another source. In that case, using copyright-fre images in one's video does not count as a citation, nor does the act of using online texs in one's video without proper indication, as noted in the literature review. While the nature of the later is open to discussion, it is excluded from analysis because of the lack of intentional effort to attribute the language.

To ensure research validity and reliabilit, I invited my colleague, an experienced ESL writing teacher, to help me identify multimodal itations. Together we watched four videos and discusse all the possile segments until we reached a full agreement. . then processed the rest of the videos by myself.

The data analysis was informed by Kress (2003) social semiotic theory that conceptualizes modes as \*culturally and socially fashioned resources for representation and communication'\* (p. 45). Central to the theory is the concept of affordance, which refers to the limitations and potentials of each mode determined by the material in which it i realized (Kres, 2014). To transcribe the selected segments, a transcript template se Table 2) has been developed following Bezemer's (2014) five steps for developing multimodal transcripts. In the template, audio and visual designs were transcribed separately: the narration of the video was transcribed verbatim, While the visual representations were described in written language by the researcher. Notes and screenshots were also added whenever ncessary. The basic unit for analysis in the current study is shot (Iedema, 2011), defined as the \*uncut camera actions" (p. 188). In the Findings section, the ilstrative students examples are also presented on the basis of the shots of the video segments. The two recorded interviews were also transcribed verbatim in English.

When all citation sements ave been transcribed, I imported the transcripts into MAx QDA, a professional qualitative data analysis software. The transcripts were coded inductively using the constant comparative method (Glaser, 1965) to identify the various ways of combining modes in reference-making and the diffrent rhetorical functions. To answer the first and second research question, multiple rounds of oding were conducted. At the initial stage, I compared individual citation segments with each other to identify the traits and characterisics of the multimodal citations and quotations. I coded specifically for resources that could inform the viewers of the original source. For example, using the linguistic phrase of "according to so and so' in voiceover is marked as an act of verbally citing the outside source. This was followed by grouping the rest of the segments into the existing groups, while also keeping the classications open to change. In other words, the coding and theorizing took place side by side, which allowed for maximum flexibility in theory-building.

The coding processfor the third research question was informed by Petric's (2007) typology of rhetorical functions of citations, which includes atribution, exemplification, further reference, statement of use, pplication, evaluation, establishing links between sources, comparison with sources, and other. Codin from the top down, I firt identified function catgories that could broady fit into Petric's typology (2007). In the second round of coding, I further classfied the use of semiotic resource into subcategories that could achieve the same rhetorical function. The interview data was used whenever necessary to triangulate the data and ilustrate the findings with students' perspectives. To ensure research rigor, member checks with the two students were administrated.

# 4. Findings

A total of 35 cases of citations and 4 cases of direct quotations were identified in the corpus. Seven of the 14 videos have provided a reference ist at the end. The data analysis generated three types of multimodal citations: concurrently afforded citations, verbally afforded citations, and visull affordd citations. The main feature that distinguishes the thr tyes of cittions isthe mode or modes that afford the act of referencing information to its original source. In terms of rhetorical functions, three broad categories- attribution, exmplificatio, and establishing links between sources-were identified, with th first one having an overwhelming dominance in the current corpus.

# 4.1. Concurrently afforded citations

In the firs category (13 cases), citations are aforded by the use of both verbal and visual resources. Concurrentlyafforded citation is realized by directly showing the original sources on par with the explicit mentioning of the source in narration. The original sources could be displayed either as static screenshots (8 cases) or dynamic screen recordings (5 cases).

The following example by S2 shows a well-executed case of how the citation could be anchored in both verbal and visual repre sentation (Table 3). When analyzing XU's ffort to reduce waste, S2 first shows the animated action of fliping the pages of the Annual Report, an important source from which he received the statistics. As S2 reports the percentage of unrecycled campus waste, the imagery zooms into a pie chart in the lower left corner that exhibits the waste division. 2 also added a finger icon pointing toward the percentage of the landfill to foreground the key information. Concurrently, the narration states that $^ { 5 6 . 9 \% }$ of the wastes in XU are not being recycled. Compared to use of static screnshots, the dynamic display of online source draws the viewer's attention to a specific part of the original source that corresponds with the information emphasized in the voiceover narration.

# 4.2. Verbally afforded citations

In the second category (14 cases), verbal language is the only mode that affords citation. The narration isacompanied by various visual representations, including videos of students talking in front of the camera (5 cases), scenic photos (2 cases), written texts (4 cases), tables/graphs (4 cases), and a website link (1 case). While visuals are incuded in the verbally afforded citations, these visuals unlike the ones in concurrently afforded citations, do not provide any reference to the original source of information. In other words While the visuals in the concurrentl afforded citations are direct visual reresentations of the source material captured in creen shots or animations, the visuals in the verbal afforded citations may not reflet straightforwardly where the content information comes from.

In the first example (Table 4), S11 attempts to orally \*cite" a study. In the voiceover, S11 reports the scientific findings on the harmful effct of plastic wastes in the oceans, while the images show marine animals being entangled in plastic products. What is particularly noteworthy aout this sement is that at the bottom of the screen, S11 provides a wesite ink, whichsems to indicatehis attempt of making an atribution. At the first glance, it is unclear whether the student intended to show the original source of the research or the image. A closer look suggests that this should be the ink to the online pictures. For this reason, the example was classified as an instance of verbally afforded citation, instead of concurrently afforded.

The use of written texts seems to correspond to verbal information in two ways. In some cases, the key information in the narration is presented in written language to provide viewers with an additional visual input. For example, in the video segment by S10 (Table 5), the key information that the student wishes to highlight-the proper name and important tistics-are typed out in bright colors against the background image that speaks to the theme of the video. In other cases, however, the written texts on screen provide more information than what isicluded in the narration. In S6's video segment (Table 6), the narration discusses the ring trend of food insecurit and the percentage f household uffrin from the problem. he written texts, however, offer extra information about how the familie in Arizona acquire their fod. t is unclear whether the texts were generated by S6 or borrowed from online sources.

Lastly, the analysis of students narration transcripts generates interesting insights into how language is used to verbally foreground sources in the firt two types of citations. The finding shows that th "according to structure is most prevalent, appearing 17 times in 10 students' videos. This is followed by the $^ { \ast \ast } \mathrm { x } +$ reporting verb' structure that occurred nine times in the data set. Less frequent is the use of other structures, such as \*by $\mathbf { X } ^ { \ast }$ (3), "as $\mathrm { ~ X ~ } +$ reporting verb' (1), and \*in X' (1). Eight different reporting verbs have been identified, among which "estimate" and "show' have occurred twice. The other six reporting verbs (accuse, claim, suggest mention,

admit, say) appeared only once in the data.

In both concurrently and verbally aforded citations, the source of information is emphasized by using specific linguistic structures that foreground the agency. But at the same time, I have noticed that in some cases vague language is used to reference sources. For example, thre students (S1, S6, and S9) used acronyms in their videos without specifying what hese acronyms stand for. S9 narrates in his video that \*According to swm, optimized water use tends to reduce water extraction from local water resources .." but it is unclear what sswM stands for. A counterexample is from the same video, where the same student narrates, The study conducted by USDA, the US Department of Agriculture, shows that this method can hel reduce the use of millons of gallons of fresh water." The inconsistency in referring to outside sources could signal the student's emerging, yet not fully developed, audience awareness.

# 4.3. Visually afforded citations

Visuall afforded citations in this study are those that rely solely on visual resources to make reference to the outside source.  total number of eight cases have bee identified as visuall afforded citations. Inall but one ca students employd visual repreentations of the original source to enact citation. The single exception includes an MLA-formatted reference entry as part of the visual representation.

A typical example of visuall afforded citation is shown in S5's segment. In Table 7 the screenshot of an online article appears simultaneously with the statement about XU's sustainabilit ranking, providing the viewers with direct visual clues of where the information comes from. In the interview, S5 explained his reason for making the citation: I cited the XU News, because that is a fact. And you know, I can't be blamed if this information is wrong because I have used this information from this source."

Apart from pointing to a single source, one student also derived information from multiple sources. Table 8illustrates how S14 provides support to her argument that the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RsPO) has been accused of engaging in the act of greenwashing. Instead of explicitly stating who made such an accusation, 14 uses the passve voice to mphasize the fact that RPO is under suspicion and accompanies the narration with two screenshots of what appear to be news artice. The tites of the two sources suggest that they could have contributed to the student's understanding of the isue. In this instance, S14 seems to have drawn the conclusion about RPO from more than one source, which is analogous to the practice of synthesizing information in traditional academic writing.

Finall, there is also a singular case where the student includes an MLA-formatted citation as part of the visual representation (Table 9). In the narration, S4discusses the example of using recyclable take-out boxes in Japan. Shown on the screen are the student's face in the background and formatted citation item in the front. The act of inserting areference entry inthe midde of the video could indicate S4's attempt to acknowledge the source of information..

# 4.4. Direct quotations

Of the four cases of quotation, two are identified in S2s video and two in S8's video. In all four cases, the direct quotations are included both in the voiceover and visuall represented. In the cases of direct quotations found in s8's video, the quoted words are typed in black leters and framed in quotation marks (Table 10). Meanwhile the student also incorporated the quoted materials in her narration, using signal phrases, such as \*said David Hondula." Moreover, S8 also explained in the interview that the quoted written texts shown in Table 10 were purposefully configured in such a way to mimic the visualeffect of " newspaper article being scanned" (S8, interview).

In S2's video, the quotations were contextualized and configured using different multimodal resources. As shown in Table 11, s2 first discusses the rising cost of recycling nationwide; simultaneously it shows the scren capture of the original source. As the student transitions to talk about the consequence of such atrend, the screen dims down, and a quoted text appears on a dark background. The written text on the scren partilly corresponds with the student's narration. Worthy noticing is that parts of the written quotation (\*pay more" and "discard the waste") are highlighted in yellow, whil no noticeable vocal changes are made in the speech.

# 4.5. Rhetorical functions

The analysis yielded three broad categories of rhetorical functions that are fulilled by the use of multimodal citations and quotations: atribution, exemplification, and establishing lins with source. Attribution reers to the act faributing information or activity to the original source. In multimodal citations, the act of making attribution is realized by using linguistic cues (e.g., \*according to") in the voiceover and/or displaying the screnshot of a single source. When these two are combined in concurrently afforded citations, the rhetorical purpose of making attribution is further enhanced by the visualization of source material see Table 3). As S5 also clarified in the interview, including the screnshots of the online article gives his video "a more persuasive ook"

Under the broad category of attribution, three sub-categories were assgned depending on the use of visual cues: attribution with visual aid, atrbution with emotional appeals, and atribution with viewer rapport. The first one refers to those that employ tables, graphs, and/r texs to rovide an altenative fom f rereenting the inforation coverd in spech t i likely that thee visuals were devised to help viewers pay attention to, proces, and remember the information, as S8 reasoned in the interview:

when you show the words visuall, the mind retains it more than jus saying it. If you had a video just talking, you wouldn't remember the statistics. But if you saw that once, you'd probably remember it. So maybe that was my intention behind, you know, just giving out the numbers. (S8, interview)

The second subcategory is seen in citations that include emotionally provoking images alongside the verbally attributed message, such as the images of marine life being traped in plastic wastes in Table 4. Lastly, the third subcategory features students talking directly intothe camera and verball attributing the information to an outside source. In those cases, the direct gaze of the narrator could be viewed as a way of trying to establish a rapport with the viewer.

It i important to note these subcategories are not mutually exclusive; instead, multiple rhetorical purposes could be achieved at the same time through the orchestration of multimodal resources. For example, in Table 5, the student appeals to emotions by showing mountains of textile waste in the background, while providing aitional visual asistance by highlighting the key information in written words.

The second broad category of rhetorical function is exemplification, identified in S4's video (Table 9). In this case, the citation is proceded by the signal phrase for example" to provide information that llustrates the previous statement. As shown in Table 9, s4 gives a concrete example of how take-out boxes could be effectively recycled by pointing to a scholarly source for support.

The last rhetorical function, also identified in only one case, is to establish lins between diffrent sources by grouping them together to make a statement (Petic, 2007).I tradtional text-ased writing, this could be done by listing the sources out following the statement. In the current multimodal context, the list of citations is replaced by a series of screenshots displayed one afer another, as shown in Table 8. Instead of pinpointing her statement about RSPO to a specific online article or website, S14 derives the information from multiple sources, which indicates the student's attempt to make connections between these sources.

# 5. Discussion

The study investigates how ESL students \*cite' outside sources and incorporate direct quotes in videos created for a firs-year composition course. The analysis yields three patterns of incorporating sources concurrently afforded, verall afforded, and visually affordd citationsthat employ differnt combinations of visual and linguistc reources t fulfil dferent rhetorical functions. Direct quotations are incorporated as part of the narration as well as the visual representation.

The study suggests that a variety of semiotic resources are mobilized by ESL students to enact multimodal citations. For example, screen captures have ben employed in 20 cases to make avisual reference to the original source. This is sometimes anchored by the explicit mentioning of sources in narration, which further trengthens the intertextual ties between students' works and outside sources. The availabilit of semiotic resources in video allows students to achieve multiple rhetorical goals at the same time. For instance, while verball attributing scientific facts and statistcs to the original sources, S10 and s11 included appalling images that demonstrate the implications of such facts and statistics in a more straightforward and emotionally provoking way. The interview data from S5 and S8 suggest that at least for the two individuals, the orchestration of speech, wrien language, and images was purposeful and strategic to some extent The variations in citation patterns and rhetorical functions are indicative of students making complicated decisions based on their understanding of the rhetorical situation, citing and genre conventions, as well a the contextual and media constraints, which corresponds to theremix and resemiotization practices that were observed among the ESL students in Hafner (2015) and Cimasko and Shin (2017).

In terms of using linguistic recourses, the study shows lear preference for the according to stucture in rporting sources, hich shares similarity with traditional academic writings produced by ESL students (Le et al., 2018; Liardet & Black, 2019). However, the flexibilit to choose multiple semiotic resources i citation-making creates room for students to show their stance toward and engage with others' arguments in nuanced ways. While some students tend to highlight the source of information by explicitly stating the name and incuding the visual rersetations (., 2 in Table 3and11), others chooseto focus more on th message in the narration (e.g., S14 in Table 8). Although it is unclear to what degree the students were intentional and conscious about the decisions made during the deigning proces, the current study shows that the multimodal writing context presents potentials for fostering a deeper understanding of stance-taking. Previous research has suggested that engaging students in the discussion of language-image relations could help them develop a metalanguage of semiotic systems (Shin et al., 2020). Future research could explore how multimodal affordances can be leveraged to help students beter understand the complicated issues of stance-taking in constructing academic arguments.

Only four cases of direct quotations in two students videos have been identified in the current study. Considering the smallsize of the corpus, it is unclear whether the findings run counter to the previous observations that beginner ESL students tend to quote excessively in academic writing (Dochert, 2019; Wang, 2016). It i quite likely that students in ths study have included the verbatim use of others words in either their narrations or as part of visual representation without framing them as such (Gynne & Bagga-Gupta, 2015; Tan, 2023; Zacharias, 2021). These observations call for more research on students' practices of recycling, repurposing, and recontextualizing textual materials during the multimodal project, which could help us better understand how students conceptualize authorship in the multimodal context.

Besides the common patterns, there are also some idiosyncratic ways of citing and quoting multimodally. For example, S4 pre. sented a bibliographic entry formatted in MLA style (Table 9). In the video by S8, the quoted words are visually presented in a dynamic manner, flying acrossthe creen verticlly from the bottom up (Table 10). These instances suggest that students might have drawn on their previous literacy practices and knowledge whil creating the videos. Table 9 could be interpreted as an instance of knowledge transfer from text-based academic writing to the multimodal context while Table 10 might reference quoting conventions across genre and cultural boundaries. These examples corroborate with previous findings that ESL students bring in their prior genre knowledge when introduced to composing in a new medium (Hafner, 2015; Kang, 2022; Shin et al., 2020). This finding also opens the iscussion of whether multimodal writing pedagogy needs to be situated in a particular (academic) discourse community and require students to adopt conventions that are widely accepted in that community.

The study is limited in the following ways. irst, the corpus comprises only 14 videos produced by students of the same class, thus the citation patterns identified here could only be interpreted when situated in this particular context. Sinceths stud is exploratory in nature, the different types of multimodal citations are not meant to be een as representative features f ESL multimodal text. Seond students started the video project by analyzing Vox videos on YouTube, which might have had an impact on their ways of indicating outside sources. Lastly, the study focuses primarily on the analysis of multimodal products; only two students were interviewed about their views of designing the multimodal itations. As a result, the rhetorical functions and effcts perceived by the viewer might not match those intended by the students. Future research could investigate students motivations and intentions behind the multimodal designs, in order to understand how they transfer prior knowledge, navigate conventions, and approach intertextuality in multimodal composing.

# 6. Conclusion

This study explores how ESL students indicate citations in videos through the use of multimodal resources. The analysis generated three patterns of \*multimodal citations that take advantage of modal affordances to make arbution, provide example, and establish links btwen soure. The study soidentifie four casf diet qtations where textal retion is prentd in writen anguage and reinforced in speech. The findings contribute to the scholarship of multimodal writing in academic context by investigating a less studied aspectndicating intertextual relations through the use of semiotic resources. While citing sources was not a focus of teaching in the current assignment design, the study suggests a need to discuss and address this issue in future pedagogy.

The findings lead to several pedagogical implications. First, writing instructors could consider situating the discussion of source integration and citation in a larger context beyond the established academic citing conventions. For example, teachers could engage students in the critical analysis of how citation and reference-making are instantiated across contexts and media, which in turn helps students understand the rationales behind academic citing conventions. Second, teachers could extend the discussion to the ethical dimensions of using different types of sources in video making, with the hope of fostering appropriate and responsible practices of using sources (Hafner, 2015). Finall, having students reflect on and justify their use of different semiotic resources in multimodal citations creates an opportuity to teach the nuanced ways of indicating attitudes toward a propositional statement and establishing an authorial voice in writing.
