LQUI metaphors, usually used to conceptualize core concepts in economics, tend to be realized linguistically to be chunks or multi-word expressions in form (such as cash flow) and to be more or less technical in meaning. Yet few studies have been conducted on how far uQup metaphorical chunks in business discourse, consisting of a word from the source domain Lquid and a word in the target domain related to Business, are technical and what their technicality is associated with. This study aims to explore the association between their technicality and frequency, collocational strength, concreteness asymmetry, and construction type, using corpus analysis, multinomial logistic regression and chi-square tests. Results show that their technicality is significantly correlated with their frequency, collocational strength, concreteness asymmetry, and construction type. uqup metaphorical chunks with low frequencies, low collocational scores and high concreteness asymmetry scores are likely to be more technical than those with high frequencies, high collocational scores and low concreteness asymmetry scores. Those in the constructions of N (Source)-N(Target) and A(Source)-NP(Target) are likely to be more technical than others. The findings may shed light on how far learners and practitioners grasp technical vocabulary and metaphorical chunks in business communication.

# 1. Introduction

The central role that metaphor plays in business or economics discourse was first proposed by two economists, Henderson (1982) and McCloskey (1986). \*[E]conomic theorists were themselves not only profusely using metaphor, but were highly conscious of doing so and were even making it an oject of theoretical relection (Herra-Soler & White, 2012, p. 2). What water is t human life, money is to busines. The LQU/wArER concept, usually used to metaphorically understand the concept MoNEY/rINANcIAL REsources, plays a noticeable role in theoretical development of conomics. In the inluential textbook Principles of Economics, for instance, \*the circular-flow diagram is a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms"; the international flow of goods and capital is one of basic concepts of open-economy macroeconomics (Mankiw, 2021, pp. 20, 640).

The uquD metaphor (also called wareR/wareRy metaphor) has bee identified as one f four frequently used metaphors in (English) economic texts (like financial articles and economic textbooks) (Tomoni, 2012), providing cognitive routes for the conceptualization of some teinolos such as market liqudity, liquid asst, net captl outlow, cash flow and csh pooling. hese teinologies, usually consisting of source domain words (flow) and target domain words (cash), are frstrfrred to as metaphorical chunks in our study. In form, metaphorical chunks are mult-word expressions characterized by their fixedness in terms of semantic and grammatical co-occurrence of lexical items (collocational strength and construction type). In meaning, the source domain word is believed to be more concret than the target domain word. In use, the tend to be more or les technica or secialized, cutting across frequency levels (being high, mid or low frequency vocabulary, Nation, 2016).

Metaphorical chunks, as multi-word units, play an essential role in creating meaning and structure in academic discourse" (Wood & Appel, 2014, p. 9), and as technical words, \*have become conventionalized in the language of economics (Charteris-Black, 2000). However, few studies have been conducted on metaphorical chunks, and the technicality of chunks received esattention than that of words (e.g. Ha & Hyland, 2017; Hatt et a., 2020). In al much more work is needed in the area of specialized vocabulary in both multi-word units and metaphor' (Coxhead, 2018, p. 62).

Therefore, this study aims to explore the association among features of uqu metaphorical chunks in business discourse on the level of form, meaning and use, namely collocational strength, construction type, concreteness asymmetry, frequency and technicality, using corpus analysis, multinomial logistic regression and chi-square tests, thereby extending the research on technicality of meta phorical chunks and contributing to the acquisition of business terminologies for EAP and ESP learners.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Lqu metaphor in business discourse

Metaphor, regarded as cross-domain mappings between conceptual domains which organizes conceptual structures in human mind (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), plays avital role in constructing new theories and new conceptions of economic phenomena, and in un. derstanding the concepts related to business and economy (Burgers & Ahrens, 2020; Henderson, 1994; McCloskey, 1986; Skorczynska & Deignan, 2006; Sun & Jiang, 2014; Sun et al., 2018; eng, Burgers, & Ahrens, 2021). Since "a basic conceptual frame in neo-classcal economics is that resource use is flexible and that resource are mobile" (Henderson, 2000 p. 172), iquid movements can be used as a basis for modelling the economy as a whole interms of notions such as ump-priming, th injectin of liqudty and flotingxchange rates" (Charteris-Black, 2004, p. 162). In particular, features of the source domain uqup, namely \*immediate accessbility" and \*transferability" are transmitted to the target domain money in order to help promote the idea of fluidity (O'Connor, 1998).

The uQUD metaphor, such as mONeY s LQUID and MONEY rRANSFER s FLUID MOTION, has been identified as one of four frequently used metaphors in busines/economics discourse (Tomoni, 2012) It \*ill beflly exploitedwhen dealing with money . which inspired the flow diagrams that can be found in every economics textbook" (Resche, 2012, p. 92). Besides, it occurs frequently in financial reports (Charteris-Black & Ennis, 2001; Cheng & Ho, 2017), businessjournalism (Cai & Deignan, 2019; Popescu, 2017), business English textbook (Skorczynska, 2010), and thus enters specialist business dctionarie and glosaries (Silaski & Kilyeni, 2011). Moreover, few differences are found in comparative studies of qup metaphor use in English, Serbian and Romanian economic terminologies (Silaski & Kilyeni, 2011) and in British and Romanian business newspapers (Popescu, 2017).

# 2.2. Lquw metaphorical chunks

The uqu metaphor in business/economics discourse tends to be realized linguistically by the combination of source domain words (such as flow) and taret domain words (such as cash), such as liquid aset, capital utlow, market liquidit, cash flow and cash pooling which are firs called metaphorical chunks i our study. They are described i terms of three components: orm, meaning, and use, following Nation's (2013, p. 49) description of vocabulary knowledge.

In form, metaphorical chunks are mult-word expressions characterized by the semantic and grammaticalco-occurrence of words Semanticlly, the co-occurrence or collocation strength of words constituting chunks, ften determined on the basis of a \*mutual information score" (MI score), is calculated by \*comparing expected to observed frequencies to establish whether the observed frequency of certain co-occurrenceis greater than what one would expect tofind by chance given the frequencies with which each of the words that form the pair occur' (Divjak & Caldwell-Harris 2015). Grammatically, they align infive syntactic constructions: A-NP, N-N, NP-of-NP, V-NP, and X is Y (Lederer, 2019) such as liquid sset, and cash flow. There was  high proportion of nouns in scientific writing, and A-NP and N-N constructions are frequently used in academic genres (Singkhachan & Ward, 2016; Ward, 2007.

In meaning, source domains words of metaphorical chunks are supposed to be more concrete than target domains words because Conceptual Metaphor Theory argues source domains (uQu) are generall thought tobe more concrete than targets (money) (Koveces, 2010, p. 329). Moreover, metaphorical chunks can be semantically either transparent, compositional (such as cash flow) or opaque, non-compositional (such as iceberg cost).

In use, uquw metaphorical chunks are more or less technical because they are mostly theory-laden. A number of what were originally metaphors have ecome conventionalized in the language of economics, and can now better be considered as technical terms than living metaphors' \*Charteris-Black, 200). For instance, market volatilit and offshore FDI are intuitively more tchnical than sources of finance and surge in export.

Though there are some researches on multi-word expressions in academic discourse such as business and engineering university textboos and EAP textbooks (Ackermann & Chen, 2013; Coxhead et al., 2017; Wood & Appel, 2014), and multiword expressions could be figurative and encode some metaphors per e (Baldwin & Kim, 2010) litte atention has been given to metaphorical chunks, not to mention Liquid metaphorical chunks in business/economics discourse.

# 2.3. Technicality of vocabulary

Technicality is \*the resource a discipline uses to name and order its emic [i.e. meaningful or relevant] phenomena in a way distinctive to that field (Wigel et al., 1989. Techniclvocabulary, \*eferring to words used in a pecific subject for communicating subject-specific knowledge, includes both high-frequency and academic words that are used with a specialized meaning in a specific subect as well as those low/lower-frequency words that apear almost exclusively in a subject Liu & Lei, 2020, p. 114). echnical vocabulary is not limited to individual words, but also includes chunks.

Measuring technicality of vocabulary has been a continuing concern. For instance, disciplinary experts were interviewed to annotate technicalit of words, which is laorious proces and ften ris excluding tems through subjective judgements Chung & Nation, 2004). Next, corpus-based keyword analysis was used to extract words that ocr significantly more frequently in the technical corpus, which are regarded as technical words (e.g. Sutarsyah et al., 1994). In addition, the Technicality Analysis Model with four factors (sense, frequency, polysemy and literal meaning) was designed to categorize the technicalit of words (Ha & Hyland, 2017). In this model, the w is rd s mrchl if is s  s mrerts  se  cr  qeny, and it is monosemous.

Technicality of vocabulary may be associated with frequency, word class, colocational strength, among others. Firstly, technical words usually occur less frequently than non-technical ones. They \*could provide coverage of up to $5 \%$ of the running words in a text" (Coxhead & Nation, 2001, p. 252), which is relatively a smallproportion (Ward, 2007). They can be high, mid and low frequency vocabulary, a category of words cuing across frequency levels (Nation, 2016). Secondly, technical words "are usually nouns (Maton & Doran, 2017). Chunks with N-N and A-N constructions have higher degrees of technicality than chunks of other constructions (Hyland, 2008; Singkhachan & Ward, 2016). Thirdly, technical chunks in academic discourse tend to be "perfectly natural combnations of words" and even "restricted collocations (Paquot, 2018). Chunks with greater colocational strength usually include \*infrequent words that re evidence of the broad lexical repertoire" while those with lower collocational strength include "relatively frequent words that are more typical of the basic' or sufficient' vocabulary skill required at the beginner and intermediate levels (Paquot, 2018).

There is a high percentage of technical vocabulary in specialized language, such as EAP and ESP (Liu & Lei, 2020, p. 119) and chunks represent technicalization more than single words do (Ward, 2007). However, previous studies focused more on technicalit of words than that of chunks, and more ontechnicality of words in medical, biomedical and health discourses than in business discourse (e.g. Ha & Hyland, 2017; Hatty et al., 2020). Besides, few studies have been conducted on how far metaphorical chunks are technical and what their technicality is asociated with in Chinese and English business/economics discourse. Overall \*much more work is needed in the area of specialized vocabulary in both multi-word units and metaphor' (Coxhead, 2018, p. 62).

# 3. Research methodology

# 3.1. Data collection

The corpus used in the study was self-built based on the concept of specialist discourse defined as communication with a relatively high degree f specialization in language features, but also in topic, audience, and production circumstances (Hermann & Sardina, 2015, p. 5). Texts in the corpus were produced by professionals and experts of busines communication using more or les specialized languages, including articles from economics journals, business legal contracts, business speeches, annual reports, corporate social responsibility (CR) reports and investment reports (se Table 1 for details). I is noteworthy that the study focused on similarities of LQUD metaphorical chunks in business discourse instead of intending to conduct an English-Chinese comparative study.

# 3.2. Research Procedures

The analysis consists of six stages. In Stage 1 (formulating the candidate ist of the uqup metaphor), the first step was to compile a word list of the semantic field uqup based on Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (McArthur, 1981) and A Thesaurus of Modem Chinese (Su, 2013), which bring together words with related meanings and is them in sets of words organized according to meaning areas instead of listing words in the alphabetical order. The second step was to check whether words on the list have a conceptual node in one of the following classes (Liquid Motion Liquid Fluid, Water, and Water Area) by using the ontology and frame semantics tools SUMO, WordNet(Ahrens & Jiang, 2020), as described in Table 2. As a result, there are 32 English words and 38 Chinese words as candidates of the Liqup metaphor as listed in Table 3.

In Stage 2 (identifying uqu metaphorical chunks), the first step was to upload the corpus into the online corpus tool Sketch Engine (Kilgarrif e l., 2014), famous fo it unction of the word skech for cllocation, and then to generate collocations of u metaphor candidates, such as fow + cash. The second step was to identify collocates with busines meanings based on Oxford Business nglish Dictionary. If collocates (cash) of uqup metaphor candidates (flow) are semantically businessrelated, those candidates would be considered potentially metaphorical. Afterwards, we further checked whether they were linguistic metaphors (metaphorical vehicle terms) based on the Metaphor Identification Procedure at VrijeUniversiteit (MIPvu) (Steen et al., 2010). Then, chunks made up of

LQuD metaphor candidates flow) and collocates with business meanings (cash) were extracted as metaphorical chunks (cash flow), in which flow is the source domain word and cash is the target domain word. Their frequencies and collocational cores automatically calculated by the Word Sketch function were retained for further analysis. The trength of collocation is expresed by the logDice score, an updated and lexicographer-friendly substitute for MI-Score (Rychly, 2008).

In Stage 3 (rating concretenes of metaphorical chunks), concreteness of metaphorical chunks indicates the degree to which source domain words are concrete compared to target domain words (Littemore et al., 2018), measured by concretenes asymmetry scores (the concretenes score of the source domain word minus that of the target domain word). Concreteness scores were given to source domain and target domain words of metaphorical chunks based on the concreteness database of English words (Brysbaert et al., 2014) There is no large-scale database for the concreteness of Chinese words until now. Following the method of a cross-lingual knowledge transfer to adapt English word abstractnessknowledge to Chinese, which proves to be feasible to measure Chinese word astractness (Jia et al., 2017), we first translated Chinese metaphorical chunks using a Chinese-English Dictionary and a LDC (Linguistic Data

Consortium) English-Chinese Wordist and then measured their concreteness based on concretenes scores of English equivalents of their source domain and target domain words.

In Stage 4 (analyzing metaphorical constructions), the construction type and predictability of metaphorical chunks were annotated based on Lederer (2019), who argues that "given a lexeme's origin - source or target -- when used in source-target metaphors. syntactic aligment can be predicted. Whilecs low is metaphorical, flow cash i not. Table 4 lists 10 possible constructions and si of them follow predicted syntactic alignments.

In Stage 5 (analyzing technicalit), an adjusted Technicality Analysis Model (ig. 1) based on Ha and Hyland (2017) was designed to measure technicality of metaphorical chunks by two strands of meaning: specialization and dificulty (Ward, 2007). Chung and Nation (2004) found that the approach of identifying technical vocabulary was quite straightforward in that the dictionaries had already been developed using decisions about what was technical and what was not, and that it was about $8 0 \%$ accurate. Thus, their specialization was measured to check whether chunks are in specialized dictionaries while their difficulty was measured to check Whether source domain words of chunks are in specialized dictionaries. The general English dictionaries referenced in this study include Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary and Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English while the dictionaries for special/- business purposes include Oxford Business English Dictionary and Longman Business English Dictionary.

If a metaphorical chunk is only included in specialized dictionaries, then it is considered as very tecnical, such as sunk cost, zijin chi cash poo). f one includd in both f neral and pilzditionaries, th i is considd s modrty tchncal, such as cash flow. If one is not included in either genralized or specialized dictionaries, then there are two situations. If the source domain word (volatilit of the chunk (market volatility) has business meaning in pecialized dictionaries, the meaning of metaphorical chunk is difficult to understand for non-specialists, and thus itis considered as most technical. f the source domain word (source) of the chunk (source of finance) has no business meanings in specialized dictionaries, the meaning of metaphorical chunk i easy to understand for non-specialists, and thus it i considered as least technical. Similarly, technicality of Chinese metaphorical chunks was measured after they were translated into English. When measuring technicalit, we did not conduct iner-coder reliability tes. For one thing, we need to measure a relatively small number of metaphorical chunks (about 500). For another, it is comparably objective to identify moderately techncal and very technical chunks because they are included in dictionaries according to the model. Only most technical and least technical chunks need to be manually identified. Thus, al the authors worked together to measure their technicality one by one based on the above criteria, discussed and resolved ambiguous cases to reach exact agreement using the "negotiated agreement" strategy (Campbell et al., 2013, p. 305).

In stage 6, herarchical multinomial logistc regressions were conducted to asses the relationship among frequency, collocational strength, concreteness asymmetry, and technicality of metaphorical chunks. Afterwards, the chi-square cross-tabulation was also conducted to asses the association between technicality and construction type. The data used in this study have been carefully considered to met the requirement of chi-square statistical tests (Tay, 2015). In other words, both variables are categorical, independent, and \*mutually exclusive and exhaustive (Tay, 2015, 2018). They also meet the requirements of minimal sample size of chi-square test. In the above statistical analysis, this study used IBM SPss Statistics (version 23.0).

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. An overview of uqu metaphorical chunks

Table 5 lists the top five Chinese and English Lqup metaphorical candidates (source domain words) with the largest number of collocate types (taget domain word types). For instance, surge collocates with 26 target domain word types such as capital, debt, and import, and #liutog (flow) with 23 target domain word types such asjioyi (transaction), chanye (industry), and AE renminbi (RMB'). However, flow and #liuliang (volume') are ones with the largest number of collocate tokens respectively in English and Chinese. In other words, flow and #liuliang (volume') are words constituting the largest number of metaphorical chunks.

We have identified 251 English and 311 Chinese uqus metaphorical chunks (types), such as cash flow and /\*Apaomo jingj (bubble economy'). Table 6 shows the top five frequently used metaphorical chunks with their collocation strength scores.

Table 7 shows concretenes asymmetry scores of some uqud metaphorical chunks. The higher theasymmetry score is the larger the gap between the concreteness of the source domain word (pool) and that of the target domain word (risk) of the chunk (risk poo) is, and vice versa. In other words, the high asymmetry score of such chunks seems to substantiate the claim that source domains are typically more concrete than target domains in the conceptual metaphor.

Table 8 shows results of construction types of Lqud metaphorical chunks. In BEC, most of them $( 9 5 \% )$ are nominal chunks in the form of N(Target)-N(Source), NP(Source)-of-NP(Target) and A(Source)-NP(Target), which accords with the prediction made by Sul. livan (2013), indicated by $\surd$ in Table 8. N-N chunks occur frequently in both general texts (Martin, 2001) and academic texts (Hyland, 2008; Ward, 2007).

Table 9 shows results of the technicality of uqun metaphorical chunks. In general, the number of very and most technical chunks (types and tokens) ismaller than that of moderately and least ones (types and tokens). It is reported that few in technical word lists could be strictly technical and many more are technical expressions whose \*technical sense may not always be apparent Fraser, 2009).

suggests that $6 7 . 5 \%$ of variance in the dependent variable \*technicality" is associated with the predictor (independent) variables "frequency, collocation strength, concreteness asymmetry".

In this study, the estimated cofficients of the logistic regression are reported in odds ratio terms, i.e. the exponentiated form of B (Tay, 2021). The definition of an odds ratio tell us that for every unit increase in Collocore (take the predictor Colloscore as an example), the odds of the chunk being moderately technical compared to the odds of being leas technical) increase by a factor of 7.152. Compared to the degree of east technical metaphorical chunks, as is suggested in Table 11, the odds of being very and most technical chunks are increasingly higher as frequency decreases $\mathbf { \vec { O R } } = 0 . 9 9 1 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.989, 0.994]; $\mathrm { O R } = 0 . 9 1 6$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.900, 0.932]), while the odds are increasingly higher as both concreteness asymmetry scores $( \mathrm { O R } = 1 . 4 4 0 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [1.26, 1.65]; $\mathrm { O R } = 2 . 0 0 2 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [1.72, 2.33]) and collocational scores increase $\mathrm { ~ \ G R } = 1 . 5 2 1 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [1.42, 1.63]; $\mathrm { O R } = 1 . 4 1 0 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [1.31, 1.54]). Next, the odds of being moderately technical chunks are increasingly higher as concreteness asymmetry scores decrease $\mathbf { \mathrm { O R } } = 0 . 3 0 6$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.21, 0.45]), and frequency $( \mathrm { O R } = 1 . 0 0 7 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [1.00, 1.01]) and collocational scores $( \mathrm { O R } = 7 . 1 5 2 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [5.73, 8.92]) increase. Given results of regression analyses, it i found that the metaphorical chunks with lower frequencies and higher concreteness asymmetry scores are more likely to be more technical than those with higher frequencies and lower concretenes asymmetry scores.

Table 12 shows the relationship between technicality and construction type of chunks with cel counts, expected counts and adjusted residuals. The results show that the technicality-construction association is significant $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 7 6 6 . 0 3 2$ $\operatorname { d f } = 1 2$ $p = . 0 0 0$ Cramer's $V = 0 . 3 3 9$ . This means that technicality varies significantly according to construction type. To further examine the nature of this variation, we ooked at the expected and observed frequencies in each cell via achi-squared analysis. The greater the iference between observed and expected frequencies, the larger the residuals would be (Tay, 2015, 2017, 2018). Adjusted residual is \*the standardized residual divided by the standard deviation of al residuals", which reflets \*the degree of deviation of the observed frequencies from the expected frequencies and thus the significance in each cell' (Zeng et al., 2020). In a normal distribution, $9 5 \%$ of the values are within the mean plus or minus 2 tandard deviations. If the absolute value of the adjusted residual is more than 2, the probability of observing this value by chance will be less than $5 \%$ , thus the residual is significant' (Zeng et al., 2020). Variations on technicality are indicated in the values of the significant adjusted residuals which are highlighted in light grey (residual ${ > } 2$ ) and dark grey (residual $< - 2 )$ . The significant residuals indicate that chunks of N(Source)-N(Target) and A(Source)-NP(Target) constructions are likely to be more technical than expected by chance and those of both N(Target)-N(Source) and V(Source)-NP(Target) constructions are likely to be les thnical. Overall the reult suppors the idea hat the onstuction of mtaphoricl chunks is asociated with their technicality.

Similarly, the frst efect we tested is the overall association among frequency, collocational strength, concreteness asymmetry score and technicality. Then we continued to examine variables influencing the technicality of metaphorical chunks. The hierarchical multinomial logistic analysis operates a forward stepwise proces shown in Table 13, starting at tep 0 by tentatively entering constant and assesing the fit of the data. When all three predictor variales are onsidered together, they significantly predict the degree of technicality, the likelihood ratio shows the final fit of the model is $\chi ^ { 2 } = 1 2 9 1 . 3 7 5$ , df $= 9$ $p < . 0 0 1$ , indicating that this model provides an adequate fit with the data.Thecollinearit stistics indicate that multiollinearity is not concern in this study (Freq, Tolerane $=$ 0.29, $V I F = 3 . 4 3$ ; ColloScore, Toleranc $\gtrsim = 0 . 2 9$ $V I F = 3 . 4 4$ ; ConcScore, Tolerance $: = 0 . 9 0$ $V I F = 1 . 1 1 $ ). The Cox & Snell pseudo $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ estimates (0.318) suggest that approximately $3 1 . 8 \%$ of variance in the dependent variable "technicality" is associated with the predictor (independent) variables "frequency, collocation strength, concreteness asymmetry".

Table 14 suggests that, compared to the degre of least technical metaphorical chunks, the odds of being moderately, very and most technical are increasingly higher as frequency decreases ( $\mathbf { \mathrm { O R } } = 0 . 9 9 7 $ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.997, 0.998]; $\mathrm { O R } = 0 . 9 9 5$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.994, 0.996]; OR $= 0 . 9 5 1$ 3 $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.942, 0.960]). The odds of being very and most technical are increasingly higher as collocational scores decrease $( \mathrm { O R } = 0 . 9 9 5$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.903, 1.097]; $\mathrm { O R } = 0 . 8 5 3$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.763, 0.954]). And the odds of being moderately and most technical are increasingly lower as concreteness scores increase $\mathbf { \tilde { O R } } = 0 . 6 9 3$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.621, 0.773]; $\mathrm { O R } = 0 . 3 5 5$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [0.301, 0.418]), but the odds of being very technical are increasingly higher as concreteness scores increase : $\mathrm { { O R } } = 1 . 1 8 5$ $9 5 \% \mathrm { C I }$ [1.039, 1.353]). Considering esults of regresion analyses, it i found that the metaphorical chunks with lower frequencies and collocational scores are predicted to >e more technical than those with higher frequencies and collocational scores.

Finall, the chi-square cross-tabulation (see Table 15) shows that the construction type of metaphorical chunks i significantly associated with their degree of technicality $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 5 4 3 . 1 5 9$ $d f = 1 2$ $p = . 0 0 0$ , Cramer's $V = 0 . 2 3 3$ . The significant residuals indicate that chunks of N(Source)-N(Target) and A(Source)-NP(Target) constructions are likely to be more technical than expected by chance and chunks of N(Target)-N(Source) to be less technical.

# 4.3. Discussion

This study aims to explore the association among technicalit, frequency, collocational strength, concreteness asymmetry, and construction type of uquw metaphorical chunks in business discourse. The statistical analyses show that the technicality of LQUD metaphorical chunks in both Chinese and English business discourse are correlated with their frequency, colocational strength, concretenes asymmetry and construction type in some ways. Metaphorical chunks with low frequency, low collocational cores and high concreteness asymmetry scores, and in the forms of N(Source)-N(Target) and A(Source)-NP(Target) are more likely to be more technical than those with high frequencies, high collocational scores and low concreteness asymmetry scores.

First of all, the technicalit of uqup metaphorical chunks was found to be negatively corrlated with their frequencies. In other words, metaphorical chunks with low frequencies are predicted to be more technical than those with high frequencies, which cor. roborates the finding that technical words or chunks usuallyoccur esfrequently than non-technical ones (Coxhead & Nation, 2001, p. 252). Though words constituting the chunks (such as iceberg and cost) are high frequency words, chunks taking on technical meanings by virtue of their combination (such as iceberg cost) may occur lessfrequently. Though it is generally not advised to spare much attention to learning low-frequency words, low-frequency ESP words should require moreattention and time (Xhaferi, 2010). To deal with these words, Nation (2001) advocates focusing on learning strategies, such as guessng their meaning, drawing on word part knowledge, or using dictionaries.

Secondly, the technicalit of uqu metaphorical chunks was also shown to be negatively correlated with collocational strength of words constituting chunks, als calle contextualize frequency (ivjak & Caldwell-Harris 2015, p. 58). I other words, metaphorical chunks with low collocational cores (MI scores) were predicted to be lesstechnical than those with high ones. A possble explanation could be that low collocational scores, meaning low-frequency colocations, result from the idiosyncratic collcation between the source domain word and target domain word, and thus poor compositionality and semantic transparency, such as bank pool,sunk cost. Since semantictransparency is naturall likely o inluence the learnabilit of a given chunk (Bors, 2020, p. 144), particular attention should be given to the semantically opaque synergistic technical Mwus [chunks] where the combination of the literal senses of their constituents diffrs from the simple combination of individual terms" in ESP and EAP teaching (Ha & Hyland, 2017). Furthermore, it is worth noting that word partnerships of low frequency words can also yield very high MI scores" (Boers, 2020, p. 144). Thus, frequency thresholds as well a collocational trength should be considered among the criteri for inclusion in compiling the ESP or EAP vocabulary list.

Thirdly, the technicalit of uqun metaphorical chunks was revealed to be positively correlated with their concretenessasymmetry scores. In other words, source domain words of technical chunks tend to be more concrete than target domain word, such as asset bubble, /\*jingji paomo (economy bubble'). The formation of technical metaphorical chunks seems to follow the concrete-toabstract principle in the Conceptual Metaphor Theory. Typicall, source domains are more concrete than taget domains, which are typically more abstract and subjective from the cognitive linguisti perspective (Koveces, 2010, p. 329). This finding suggests that teachers nd to enhance ESP or EAP learners metaphorical awareness by drawing their atention to the source domain or to the origin of unfamiliar figurative expressions in order for student to cope beter with the specialized reading of business dicours (Boers, 2000).

Fourthly, metaphorical chunks of N(Source)-N(Target) and A(Source)-NP(Target) constructions tend to be more technical than those of other constructions. Technical ocabulary is mostly represented by compound nominal forms because nouns usually convey specific and compact meanings (Hyland, 2008; Singkhachan & Ward, 2016; Ward, 2007). Moreover, technical terms as nominal phrases usually have a Classifier $^ +$ Thing construction (Pueyo & Val, 1996). For instance, liquid in liquid assets (A(Source)-NP(Target)) acts as a classifier.

In addition, our findings may help us understand the global perspective of English for academic or specific purposes. From the viewpoint of needs analysis, teaching metaphorical chunks in busines discourse necessarily entail the teaching of these concepts themselves and the asic assumptions which underlie them (Chartri-Black, 200). In terms of materials development, itis necessary to build towards a repertoire of discipline-specific vocabulary lists for EAP teaching and learning that incorporates not only words but also chunks, particularly classified based on their frequency, technicality, and construction type.

With regard to teaching methodology, useful trategies in teaching metaphorical chunks as technical vocabulary include identifying technical terms with the aid of corpus methods, direct list learning of "adding the new words (mostly nouns and verbs) to their existing system' (Gu, 2020, p. 275), and leaning and checking the meanings of the target technical words in their 1 (Liu & Lei, 2020). In teaching metaphorical chunks as businessvocabulary, the incidental approach is preferred by providing students with massive exposure to authentic language use for them to take in the use of the vocabulary (Zhang & Sun, 2018). In teaching metaphor, conitive intervention may be necessary to explicitl activate students awarenessof business metaphors by explicitl presenting conventional conceptual metaphors in business iscourse, such as money s uqub, and guiding the students to search the linguistic metaphors in a Business English corpus (Zhang & Sun, 2018). Vverall this study may help learners and practitioners of Business English recognize the importance of metaphorical chunks and their technicality.

# 5. Conclusion

The study reported in this paper conducted an analysis of the relationship among technicality, frequency, collocational strength, concretenes asymmetry, and construction type of uqu metaphorical chunks. With the aid of corpus and tatistical analyses, we found that the semantic and syntactic features of uqup metaphorical chunks in English and Chinese businessdiscourses share many similarities since "tquw metaphors are mainly dead metaphors in economic terminology (Silaski & Kilyeni, 2011). It was found that technicalit isignificantly correlated with frequency, collcational strength, concretenessasymmetry and construction type. Spe. cifically, metaphorical chunks with low frequency, low collocational scores and high concreteness asymmetry scores will be more technical than those with high word frequency, high colocational scores and low concretenes asymmetry scores. Metaphorical chunks of N(Source)-N(Target) and A(Source)-NP(Target) constructions are likely to be more technical than expected by chance.

Admittedly, this study has a few limitations. First of al we limited the analysis of uqu metaphors to the discussion of some features of metaphorical chunks in business discourse, excluding others. A more generalized predictive model could be further dis cussed, and more linguistic features could be considered in the future to beter predict their technicality. In addition, annotating technicality and concreteness asymmetry of Chinese metaphorical chunks are largely based on the database designed for English words, which may influence the findings about thir technicalit. Despite these limitations, the study might be the first to put forward the concept of metaphorical chunks and to explore potential features associated with their technicalit. In addition, the findings may shed light on why and how to teach metaphorical chunks and their technicality in EAP and ESP, and thus contributing to both of learners and practitioners in the field of business communication.
