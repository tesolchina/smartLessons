# Discovering the hidden treasure on the Internet: using Google to uncover the veil of phraseology

Formulaic speech has been notoriously difficult to define and identify despite its crucial importance to native-like fluency and idiomaticity. In this article, I introduce a way of identifying phraseological units in a running text. I am interested in recurrent fragments like charged with crimes against humanity in texts which involve multiple word collocations in a fuzzily fixed' lexico-syntactic frame. I suspect these kind of phraseological fragments not only add to the fluency and idiomaticity of texts, save text production time, but actually constitute milestones in the generation of text and sentences. No currently well known corpus seems large enough to provide adequate instances of prefabricated chunks like this for closer investigation. It is proposed here that Internet as a gigantic corpus and a search engine like Google can help identify and retrieve these phraseological units for linguistic research and language teaching and learning.

# Introduction

The importance of habitually co-occurring word groups in language is now widely recognised in linguistics research and language education. Habitual word combinations come in all shapes and have been variously labelled as collocation, lexical phrase, formulaic sequences, prefabricated items, and so on. The most well explored area is certainly collocation, where the extensive research has led to publications of collocation or phrasal dictionaries of all kinds and a proliferation of CALL applications. For word combinations larger than the two or three word units (e.g. completely redundant, put up with), existing research often focus on formulaic speech consisting of well formed phrases (e.g. by the way) and clause (e.g. $I t$ was nice talking to you), emphasising their pragmatic functions and their implications for time management in speech processing. Phraseological units identifiable in text whose forms and boundaries are less clear like that highlighted in text (1) are relatively less explored.

A baby boy positively identified by DNA testing decades after he died when the Titanic sank has now been named as someone else. (BBC News 2007a, my emphases)

For each of the highlighted fragments in (1), Google has found 1040, 8820, and 8850 documents respectively which bear exactly the same fragments. When looking up BNC (British National Corpus), although twelve examples of the collocation positively identified were found, only one example of the sequence positively identified by was found, and no example of positively identified by DNA was found. Neither of the other two highlighted sequences in (1) can be found in BNC. This article will argue fragments like these are abundant in native-speaker writings. They are important not only because they save the writer's processing time and increase the fluency and idiomaticity of the text, they may be playing a central role in sentence and text production as well. Through a method I recently developed, I will show how Google can be used to locate word sequences like this on the Internet and how this core technology can be further developed into various CALL and language technology programmes.

This article is divided into three main parts. In the first part, I review some key concepts in the research of formulaic sequences and identify the specific type of phraseology I am most concerned with in this essay. The second part of the article is then devoted to explaining the Google-based method for verifying formulaic sequences. Finally, the third part explains how this methodology can contribute to computer assisted language learning.

# Typology of formulaic sequences

There are some conventional thoughts about types of formulaic sequences in linguistic circles. A recent summarisation of these thoughts can be found in Allerton (2004), where phraseology is classified into six kinds:

compounds: single lexemes like policewoman, fire-engine;   
collocations: two-word combinations where one is 'specially selected...to fit the semantics of the other one' (p. 91), e.g. heavy rain, night falls;   
. phrasal verbs: combinations of verbs and adverbs, like cut down and use up;   
idioms: an expression whose meaning cannot be derived from its constituent words in a regular fashion, e.g. by and large, spill the beans;   
. metaphors: instances of a particular mode of interpretation' (p. 98), e.g. clamour for attention, denying all light to [the seed];   
proverbs and minor fixed expressions: full sentences having a fixed form and often including 'verse-like rhythm' (p. 101), e.g. There's many a slip twixt cup and lip.

It is clear that such a conventional phraseological framework can hardly account for the formulaic sequences like those found in text (1). First of all, these word combinations are not compounds or collocations because they are multiple-word units. They are not simply phrasal verbs. They are not idioms because their meanings are extremely transparent. They are certainly not proverbs or metaphors because they don't have any obvious features of figurative language. To find a reference point for the recurring sequences shown in (1), we need to look elsewhere for some non-canonical paradigms.

A somewhat less recent work, Nattinger and DeCarrico (1992), actually offers a framework likely to accommodate the formulaic sequences we are interested in. The authors distinguish between four kinds of 'lexical phrases':

polywords: short phrases functioning like single lexical items, e.g. in a nutshell, by and large;

institutionalised expressions: individual utterances used for social function, e.g. How do you do? Nice meeting you,   
phrasal constraints: semi-fixed short or medium-length phrases, e.g. as far as I , what with (and all);   
sentence builders: a framework to construct whole sentences, e.g. My point is that

'Phrasal constraints' and 'sentence builders' are flexible enough in structure to be like the formulaic expressions we highlighted in (1), especially the latter. However, the examples Nattinger and DeCarrico provide are still highly traditional', in the sense that the fixed portion is relatively familiar to native speakers at a conscious level, and the constraints on the flexible part, on the other hand, have not been satisfactorily analysed in multiple linguistic domains (i.e. lexico-semantic, pragmatic, syntactic, etc.) for us to understand the nature of these phraseological units. For a more complicated view of this kind of semi-fixed sequence, we need to look into two relatively new corpus-based approaches to words and phrases: Stubbs' (2002) Extended Lexical Unit and Hoey's (2005) Lexical Priming theory.

Stubbs (2002) proposes the term Extended Lexical Unit (ELU) for a kind of lexicosemantic structure which exhibits distinctive collocational, colligational, semantic, and discourse properties. A good example is the word undergo. A brief Internet research shows the word to collocate with words like surgery, examination, makeover, training, change, and so on, which mostly contain the semantic features of 'pain', 'effort', 'transformation' etc., and there is normally an unpleasant sense, or discourse prosody, associated with this phraseology. Moreover, in terms of grammatical features, we often find undergo appearing in the V Adj N frame, for example, undergo minor surgery, or undergo extreme makeover. According to Stubbs, an ELU does not have a fixed form, but does have some typical realisations. For example, from Google search we can identify typical expressions revolving around undergo like so:

Cheney will undergo minor surgery Saturday morning he will undergo prostate surgery tomorrow Brown is scheduled to undergo shoulder surgery this morning

That is, a prototypical ELU involving undergo is often in future tense, associated with a certain unpleasant event, and followed by a specified date. This will not always be the case. It is only a representative usage of this extended lexical unit.

Stubbs' (2002) framework seems to be especially suitable for analysing the highlighted chunks in text (1). For example, for the fragment positively identified by DNA, we can identify the collocation positively identified to be the core of this phraseology. The semantic preference of this ELU is (though not necessarily always) the forensic, medical, or scientific domain, and the discourse prosody is usually a kind of hopeful indication of the uncovering of some kind of mystery. Some typical examples via Google search are:

He was positively identified using DNA samples taken from his son   
SARS virus positively identified by Mark Johnson April 17, 2003   
The botanical species of Fingerprinted herbs are positively identified by the sophisticated Thin   
Layer Chromatograph

In grammatical terms, the phraseological unit revolving around positively identified often appears in a passive structure, especially when used as a title of a news report. Thus, we have the potential of getting a relatively complete picture of this extended lexical unit, including its collocational, colligational, semantic, and discourse properties using Stubbs' (2002) approach.

Another recent work which can shed light to the analysis of word combinations like those found in (1) is Hoey (2005). Hoey uses the term lexical priming' to explain how language is acquired and used. He insists that each individual has a unique set of 'mental concordances' for every word, which dictates how this word is used in terms of its collocations, colligations, semantic and pragmatic associations. For example, word is primed for many people to collocate with communication words like say or hear. This is its semantic preference. This combination then has the pragmatic value of expressing negative values, for example:

o I would never say a word against you o I would not hear a word against her

Hoey (2005) and Stubbs (2002) have made an important contribution to the recent research on phraseology: They have separately come up with a cogent theory about the nature of a fuzzy kind of phraseology which is multidimensional and powerful. This kind of phraseological unit usually has a recognisable core sequence and fuzzy extensions which are bound by semantic, grammatical, discoursal or pragmatic conditions. The highlighted word sequences in (1) may well be the kind of phraseology Hoey and Stubbs have in mind. These phraseological units are still relatively less explored and understood. It is the aim of this article to introduce an analytical method for this kind of formulaic sequence to help clarify their existence in texts.

# Google-based phraseology research

With its powerful engine and the gigantic web-based corpus, Google can offer solutions to many of the research questions in phraseology which even a billion-word corpus can hardly handle. I will illustrate in this section a method I have developed for identifying formulaic sequences in text via the help of Google. A longer text is used for this purpose as quoted in (2) below.

Cattle at a farm in Surrey have been found to be infected with foot-and-mouth disease.

Some 60 animals on the farm close to the village of Wanborough near Guildford have tested positive for the disease which wreaked havoc in 2001.

A $3 \mathrm { k m }$ protection zone has been put in place around the premises and a UK ban imposed on movement of all livestock. (BBC News 2007b, my emphases)

Let us look at the fragment have been found to be infected with in the first place. If we look up Google for the frequencies of the consecutively diminished subsets of this word group, we can get very interesting and informative results. Table 1 has recorded the results of my Google searches at the time of writing.

The frequencies alone can tell a good story about the relations between words and word groups within this fragment. For example, we can see there are approximately three bands of frequencies between the seven word groups: there are two in the billions, three in the millions, and two in the thousands. The 'net' topped-up words in the same frequency bands (e.g. found to be in 3-5) seem to have a closer bond with each other than with other words in the fragment. Now, if we take $\log _ { 2 }$ out of these frequency numbers and make a chart, as Figure 1, the picture becomes even clearer.

The numbers (1-6) on the x-axis in Figure 1 correspond to the respective number of words in Table 1. Y-axis shows the base-two logarithms of the frequencies for the respective seven word groups, the mathematical transformation which I find to best capture the frequency fluctuations as the number of words increase in the fragment. Figure 1 shows word numbers 1-2 to be on roughly the same frequency level (32-31), and the same is true for word numbers 3-5 (24-21) and 6-7 (14-13), as previously observed from Table 1. The chart also tells us some other things, namely:

when the number of words increase in a fragment, the frequency of the overall fragment decreases;   
when a new word is added to a fragment and the frequency line remains stable (i.e. level), that word is closely bound to the word within a fragment which it is attached to, and the overall fragment may be considered formulaic;   
when a new word is added to a fragment that causes the overall frequency to precipitate, the overall fragment can no longer be considered formulaic.

Based on these principles, we can say have been, found to be, and infected with are closely bound to each other/one another respectively within the group. The entire fragment is reasonably formulaic (which is generally assumed to be a matter of degree, rather than all or none. See Pawley 2007, p. 17, for example). If we replace infected with contaminated, the frequencies from word group 6-7 change slightly upward, as Table 2 shows, although the rounded-up logarithms do not reflect much of this change.

Table 1. Frequencies for have been found to be infected with.

Figure 1. Frequency chart for have been found to be infected with.

This new set of data is likewise made into a chart, shown as Figure 2.

This tells us that in this particular phraseological environment, choosing either contaminated or infected will make a reasonable formulaic sequence. If we choose a synonym of one of these two words, say polluted, the frequency count will dramatically drop and the overall frequency line will precipitate. These are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3 respectively.

This seems to tells us that polluted is not particular suitable for this phraseological unit. This is an issue of complicated collocation rather than semantic preferences, as polluted means roughly the same as contaminated. It is not a simple matter of the frequency count of contaminated being higher than polluted either. Although we cannot conveniently calculate the strength between elements in the extended lexical unit as we do a $t$ -score for collocations, because an ELU involves far too many words, yet simple frequency counts can reveal some categorical differences. Table 4 shows how the words infested, contaminated, and polluted compare with one another in terms of individual frequencies and the overall frequencies when they are attached to the same word sequence have been found to be __ with.

Table 2. Frequencies for have been found to be contaminated with.

First of all, Table 4 shows consistent frequency ranking among the three words in question from both BNC and Google results: infested is the most frequent, followed by contaminated, with polluted being the most infrequent among the three. When they are each subsumed in the frame have been found to be _ with, however, contaminated apparently stands out as a prominent member of this phraseological unit, and polluted falls disproportionably behind.

Earlier we mentioned Stubbs' (2002) ELU theory, for which collocation is only one factor. If we were to temper the parameter of semantic preferences by, for example, replacing infected with a common word filled from a different semantic field, then we get an even more surprising result, as Table 5 and Figure 4 jointly show.

With the past participle changed to filled (a relatively frequent word with 191 million Google hits compared to the 33 million hits of contaminated), the overall frequency line drops dramatically at that particular point. Why? Presumably we can say something like The buckets have been found to be filled with water which is perfectly grammatical and meaningful, but we find very few such examples by Google. This is, in fact, what phraseology is all about. It is not grammar which controls what we actually say, but phraseology, and phraseology has preferences at all levels. This also implies that when people want to talk about X being infected/contaminated by Y, then $X$ have been found to be infected/contaminated by $Y$ is probably one of the limited number of phraseologies people match their concepts onto, instead of exploring all the grammatical possibilities. This is very much what Hunston and Francis (2000) mean when they insist that patterns have meanings and that words (and therefore concepts) only map into certain patterns particular to them. This also shows how important it is for language learners to acquire a large number of phraseologies and patterns in order to be admitted into a discourse community, the wish to blend in.

Figure 4. Frequency chart for have been found to be filled with.

Next we have a likely formulaic sequence of close to the village of. Its Good statistics and frequency chart are shown in Table 6 and Figure 5 respectively.

Table 6. Frequencies for close to the village of.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>No. of Words.</td><td>Fragment</td><td>Google Hits</td><td>Log2</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>close</td><td>898,000,000</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>2 </td><td>close to</td><td>297,000,000</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>close to the</td><td>95,600,000</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>close to the village</td><td>237,000</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>close to the village of</td><td>96,600</td><td>17</td></tr></table></body></html>

Figure 5. Frequency chart for close to the village of.

Again we can see a drop in frequency where village is first introduced into the sequence. Up to the point though, the line has been relatively level, signifying close to the as part of a good phraseology. If we keep the $\mathbf { N }$ of structure following it and look up the sequence 'close to the \* of' in Google ( $^ *$ means 'anything'), we get the resultant statistics and chart in Table 7 and Figure 6 respectively.

As can be seen from Figure 6, the overall pattern of close to the \* of is a rather respectable formulaic sequence since the adding of each element does not change the frequency too much in terms of the $\log _ { 2 }$ line which we have previously established to be a good indication of phraseology. If we look at the actual instances of this pattern fetched by Google, we can know why close to the village of does not maintain a relatively straight phraseological line - most of the nouns in this frame are in fact a kind of geometry nouns', like so:

close to the edge of a river   
close to the surface of the spinning orb   
close to the centre of Skovde   
close to the limit of what those technologies can do   
close to the heart of the corrupt Confederacy   
close to the brink of collapse   
close to the centromere of chromosome 16   
close to the boundary of the given aftershock zone   
close to the midpoint of depletion   
close to the onset of the magnetic order

Thus, close to the village of, often followed by the actual name of the village, seems to be of a different type than the mainstream usage of the unit close to the of. This we discovered by creatively manipulating the Google query phrase. This is also an example demonstrating the usefulness and insightfulness of a more complicated and comprehensive view of phraseology like that offered by Stubbs (2002) ELU approach which encompasses collocational, colligational, semantic and discourse dimensions. In this case, we have close to the as the core collocation of a phraseological unit, which prefers to attach to a geometrical noun'. The typical usage of this phraseology is in scientific explanation or giving directions. The discourse prosody could be negative if this expression collocates with 'corruption', 'collapse', limit' and so on. In sum, the investigation of the fragment close to the village of with Google has resulted in the discovery of a more general pattern which is implicational to linguistics research and language learning.

Table 7. Frequencies for close to the \* of.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>No. of Words</td><td>Fragment</td><td>Google Hits</td><td>Log2</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>close</td><td>898,000,000</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>close to</td><td>297,000,000</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>close to the</td><td>95,600,000</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>close to the * of</td><td>12,900,000</td><td>24</td></tr></table></body></html>

Figure 6. Frequency chart for close to the \* of.

The next fragment, have tested positive for the disease, likewise offers us a chance to extract the relatively fixed core of a formulaic sequence and to explore its fuzzy peripheral elements.

What Table 8 and Figure 7 jointly tell is a rather credible story: namely, tested positive for could be the core of a phraseology judging from the level frequency line spanning word numbers 2-5. It is understandable that this line should drop dramatically from word one since there are too many possibilities after the word have. Moreover, the conspicuous frequency fall at the point of disease also tells us that there are plenty of other possibilities for this particular slot, one of which is virus. In fact, Google search with have tested positive for \* disease OR virus' has produced 81,300 hits (about one third of the frequency of have tested positive for, meaning for every three instances of have tested positive for, one is followed by disease or virus with or without some words between them). Studying the actual examples fetched by Google will again reveal certain truths about this phraseology.

have tested positive for SARS corona virus have tested positive for Whirling Disease have tested positive for H5 influenza virus have tested positive for feline leukemia virus have tested positive for rabies virus have tested positive for Herpes B virus have tested positive for Huntington's Disease have tested positive for canine influenza virus have tested positive for Johne's disease have tested positive for HIV virus

Figure 7. Frequency chart for have tested positive for the disease.

A point worth commenting on about this phraseology is that it most often takes animals as its subjects, such as cats, dogs, monkeys, herds and so on, although it also takes inanimate objects such as swimming pools and blood samples, and occasionally also human beings, as in the case of HIV virus. Given this well established formulaic framework capable of expressing a complex conceptual structure, it is no wonder that when a new instance of foot-and-mouth disease occurs in the UK, the BBC reporter chooses to implement the framework which seems to accommodate the new message in a quite proficient manner.

Next we look at the fragment protection zone has been put in place from a phraseological point of view. In this case, the increase of number of words (or the decrease of frequency counts) from the left-hand side will not make much sense. Although the half-million Google hits (i.e. 548,000) for the collocation protection zone is reasonable, yet the frequency of the fragment precipitates to just 777 when has is introduced. The phraseology investigation thus grinds to a halt. It is more fruitful in this case to start from the right-hand side, i.e. from the word place. The results are shown in Table 9 and Figure 8.

Table 9. Frequencies for protection zone has been put in place.

Figure 8. Frequency chart for protection zone has been put in place.

Briefly, the interpretation of Figure 8 is as follows:

. The high frequency word place unsurprisingly generates one billion Google hits.   
o In place is a strong combination as it takes up about one fifth of all possible combinations of place with other words. Put in place only accounts for about $1 \%$ of all possible instances of in place. Has been put in place is a reasonably good phraseology as witnessed by the level frequency line (21-21-19) in Figure 8.   
Neither protection zone has been put in place nor [some kind of] zone has been put in place is a good phraseological unit judging from the fall of the frequency line at their respective points.

Further investigations via Google shows the phraseological core from the above fragment, i.e. has been put in place, likes to attach itself to words denoting 'action plans' such as arrangement, process, procedure, programme, operation, rule, strategy and so on. This somehow reinforces the phraseological status of the unit.

The final fragment left for investigation from BBC text (2) is ban imposed on movement of, whose analysis is jointly offered by Table 10 and Figure 9.

Unfortunately, this set of statistics and chart only shows imposed on to be close allies, as they maintain a somewhat level frequency line (18-16) between themselves. The same is true with movement of, although the actual frequencies are too low to be consequential. We can only conclude that in this case, we fail to discover any meaningful phrase-long formulaic sequences, although we do find one or two possible collocations.

Figure 9. Frequency chart for ban imposed on movement of.

In this section, I have shown how Google can be used to verify the phraseological status of a sentence fragment, by diminishing the fragment one word at a time and recording the frequency of the remaining portion. I have also demonstrated how subsequent research of relevant examples fetched by Google can reveal more structural, semantic, or pragmatic properties of the phraseology in question. In the next section, we will discuss why phraseology is important to language learners and how the method developed here can help distinguish native speaker writings from learner compositions.

# Phraseology and language learning

According to Wray (2002), there are two central functions of formulaic sequences: to achieve successful interactional events and to save processing efforts. Although these functions are more relevant to oral communications, in written language formulaic expressions should have similar function of making the text fluent and idiomatic, as well as speeding up the writing processes by mapping certain fixed conceptual structures to phraseology directly, saving time for other more creative conceptualising tasks. Pawley (2007) endorses this theory by saying that formulaic sequences do not have to be generated and so free the encoder to attend to concurrent tasks' (p. 22).

Pawley (2007) rightfully claims that most adult second language learners seem to have particular difficulty with certain kinds of formulaic language ... even when they are otherwise completely fluent' (p. 25). This point is echoed by Wray's (2002) note that 'advanced learners struggle to sound idiomatic' (p. 191). The Google-based method developed in the previous section can allow us to see the 'degree of idiomaticity' of a piece of writing in an objective and informative way. It can therefore allow us to spot the differences between a learner text and a native-speaker text. Let us examine the extract from a Chinese college student's English writing in (3) below.

First of all, the most usual function of the mobile phone is that people can reach you all the time as long as you didn't turn off the mobile phone.

We can ignore first of all, as it is a standalone fixed expression. Although it no doubt gives the learner some credit in the ability to use formulaic expressions, nevertheless the phrase does not carry out any phraseological function with the ensuing words. To analyse the rest of the text using the Google-based method we developed earlier, we first divide the text into several fragments, and then make their frequency tables and charts. A possible way of distinguishing the fragments is as follows:

(4) 1. the most usual function of the mobile phone is 2. people can reach you all the time 3. as long as you didn't turn off the mobile phone

Let us now make a synthesised table and a synthesised chart for the three fragments in (4), as Table 11 and Figure 10 respectively.

As we can see from the chart in Figure 10, no level sections of the frequency line (except the meaningless zero or close-to-zero frequency bands) exist in any of the three fragments. This means no elements of phraseology seem to be represented in the learner's writing except the cliche kind (i.e. first of all, as long as). In contrast, let us consider a text written by English native speakers on the same topic, in (5):

Figure 10. Overall frequency chart for fragments in text (4).

Mobile phones are used by people to decide how and when they communicate with the rest of the world, say researchers. (BBC News 2003)

Again, we split the text into some fragments based on intuitively judged likelihood of each fragment being part of a phraseological unit. This appears in (6) below.

1. are used by people to   
2. decide how and when they   
3. communicate with the rest of the world

The initial mobile phones are omitted to avoid giving the native speaker writing an unfair disadvantage as are used by people to could well be a formulaic expression in its own right. If it doesn't start its own frequency block but instead were attached to mobile phones, then it would have very little chance of establishing itself as a phraseological unit based on frequencies. The Google frequency counts of the text in three blocks and the overall frequency line are given in Table 12 and Figure 11 respectively.

A strong overall impression when comparing Figure 11 (native speaker text) with Figure 10 (learner writing) is that the three blocks of frequency line in the native speaker chart are much smoother. They are not only more relatively level but they also generally function at higher frequency level - they don't have portions that go down all the way to the bottom and remain inactive there at zero frequencies, like the learner's frequency line.

The above comparative analysis not only shows the difference between native and nonnative speaker writings in terms of formulaic expressions, it also has implications in terms of language production. A currently standard speech production model like that promoted by Levelt (1989) claims that sentences are produced via the conceptual to the lemma route. That is, a conceptual structure activates certain lemmas (lemma being a more abstract kind of word). Lemmas then use the grammatical features associated with each of them to construct a syntactic frame (See Bock & Levelt, 1994). This means the generation of sentences and text are word based. If the phraseological analyses conducted by this research are believable, however, it is very likely that text production is phraseology based rather then word based. This is most clearly witnessed by Figure 11, where formulaic sequences come in spurts, eventually constituting the whole sentence. We may all be thinking and writing in phraseology'.

# GALL

This work has relied on the use of the web as a huge corpus to extract phraseological units using Google as a tool. The implication for language teaching and learning is similar to those brought about by corpus linguistics. In the past decade, from Wichmann, Fligelstone, McEnery, and Knowles (1997) to O'Keeffe (2007), numerous attempts have been made to translate the results of corpus linguistics research to the theory and practice of language teaching. Unfortunately, well developed large corpora such as British National Corpus and Bank of English still remain closed systems (i.e. peculiar to their interfaces and not freely available in their full forms) and cannot be easily integrated into a teaching or learning platform. With more and more people using Google including the language learners, the web as a free corpus and Google as a matching concordancer could become an easily accessible and surprisingly empowering learning aid. Indeed, GALL (Google Assisted Language Learning) may sooner or later become a distinct branch of CALL, similar to ICALL (Intelligent CALL).

Hockey (2004) correctly points out the problem of using Google for research (or teaching, for that matter) when she says, Much of what Google finds is delivered in a format that is meant to be read rather than analysed or manipulated further' (p. 10). What we need is an intermediate programme able to translate Google's findings into research or teaching-friendly interfaces. This is already happening or beginning to happen. WebCorp, for example, is an online system which hitherto has relied on commercial search engines like Google to fetch data and present them like concordance lines (Renouf & Banerjee, 2005). Guo and Zhang (2007), on the other hand, develop a simple interface using ActiveX commands to harness the results of Google-based collocation search.

The methodology proposed in this article can be applied to CALL, or GALL, by following one of three strands:

developing a fully automatic phraseology identification and verification programme;   
. designing a separate interface to allow the user to conveniently explore phraseological units on the web; compiling self-access instruction material for learners to explore the web with Google within the environment of a regular web browser.

A fully automatic phraseology writing aid will require an algorithm using the Googlebased formulaic sequence checking method developed in this article to help the learner identify phraseological units in his or some other people's writings. It should also be able to accept word or phrase queries from the learner and find relevant formulaic sequences from the web. Similar ideas have been implemented in other fields, for example, the automatic extraction of biomedical information from the web using Google (Satre, Tveit, Steigedal, & Lagreid, 2005). The methodology proposed in this article does not involve semantic information or natural language processing, so the procedure is expected to be simpler and the result more reliable.

Figure 12.  A Google-based online phraseology analyser interface.

Another way to use the machinery introduced here is to adopt Guo and Zhang's (2007) approach, that is, designing an interface dedicated to the look-up of formulaic sequences on the web via Google. Figure 12 is a possible example.

The final mode of implementation of this model is just to strip off all programming elements and offer the learner only guidance and instructions with possibly matching work sheets or writing tasks where they access Google via a regular web browser. This is similar to Kaur and Hegelheimer's (2005) approach, which uses online concordancing and online dictionary to enhance students' knowledge in vocabulary while performing a writing task. Arguably, adding a phraseological component will certainly increase the fun of the discovery processes and take the corpus-based learning one step forward.

# Conclusion

This article is mainly concerned about a fuzzy kind of phraseological fragment whose closest definition is Stubbs' (2002) Extended Lexical Unit. These formulaic sequences do not have a fixed form, but do have a more or less fixed core collocation and possibly some prototypical expressions. Despite this structural fuzziness, these phraseological units are pervasive in texts, and have strong semantic and pragmatic preferences which divulge their intimate links with human conceptual structures. This has strong implications for both psycholinguistic research and language learning. In this article, I have suggested a way of identifying this kind of formulaic sequence via Google search. The method I introduced can be applied by any linguistic researcher or language learner with access to the Internet and a search engine. Examples of formulaic sequences found via this method not only represent valuable recourses for phraseology research but also provide second language writers with models of idiomatic expressions which are presented in a comprehensible way. Finally, I have also indicated how this phraseology discovery machinery can be applied to CALL, namely, via an automatic and intelligent system, using a dedicated web interface, or simply implemented in a classroom or self-learning setting with a regular web browser.
