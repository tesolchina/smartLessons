Graduation paper

Against the background of increasing L2 writing strategy research from a sociocultural paradigm in recent years, writing scholarship has been focusing on L2 learners' writing strategies in various writing tasks. Undergraduate students' graduation paper in the Chinese context, however, has yet to receive sufficient attention. Informed by Activity Theory framework (Engestrom, 1987, 1999), this paper adopted a case study design and investigated a Chinese undergraduate student's writing strategies in the graduation paper writing activity. Drawing on interviews with the student and the advisor, the student's paper, and supplementary documents (e.g., paper guidelines), this study showed that the student utilized artefact, rule, community, and role mediated strategies to complete the writing task. Contradictions within and beyond the activity system also existed, which constrained the successful mediation of some of the writing strategies and posed challenges to the student's writing activity. Implications for research and pedagogy are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

The recent years have witnessed an epistemological turn of aproaching second language (L2) writing from the cognitive to the sociocultural paradigm (Block, 2003; Lantolf, 2006; Lei, 2008), which accentuates that writing activity cannot be separated from its social, historical, and political contexts (Prior, 2006). This sociocultural turn in L2 writing reearch has influenced approaches to and understanding of writing processes and strategies. Cognitively-oriented L2 writing strategy research has tended to focus on individual writers' mental operations, such as planning, reading, rehearsing, drafting, revising, and editing (Chien, 2008; Cumming, 1989, Kellogg, 2008; Limpo & Alves, 2013; Raimes, 1985; Wong, 2005; Zamel, 1983); from the sociocultural lenses, however, writing strategy use is intricately connected to the larger social contexts in which writing is embedded (Lei, 2008). Under this social turn. Activity Theory (AT) (Engestrom, 1987, 1999), which emphasizes the object-driven and socially-mediated nature of human activity, provides a powerful framework for examining strategy use during writing processes.

While writing strategies may be examined in various tak environments, research in contexts where novice writers perform new and challenging tass can be particularlyilluminating ince such research can provide a fuller picture of how students use various resources to mediate their writing and cope with related challenges. One such task facing novice writers in the Chinese EFL context is the graduation paper, a data-based research paper required of all English majors in their senior year. Despite of its importance for English majors in the Chinese EFL context, the graduation paper represents one of the "disciplinary genres that are currently not well represented in the research literature (Lee & Chen, 2009, p. 283). Littl is known about how students mediate their writing as they complete the graduation paper. Capturing novice writers writing strategies on this underrepresented task in their social context would extend writing strategy research and provide insights to inform EAP pedagogy. In the sections below, we report a case study examining one Chinese EFL undergraduate's writing strategies related to her graduation paper.

# 2. Theoretical and research background

# 2.1. Activity theory and L2 writing strategy research

From the sociocultural perspective, human activities are situated in social, cultural, and historical contexts. Activity Theory originated from Vygotsky's (1978) works where the notion of mediation was introduced and the dialectical relationship between human and society was brought up (Cole & Engestrom, 1993). However, Activity Theory does not represent a single theoretical approach (Kaptelinin, 2005). One key AT approach, developed by Engestrom (1987, 1999, 2001), provides a framework for examining human behaviors in collectie activity systems. In ths activity system, as llustrated in Fig 1, human activity consis of ix eential components. Subject refers to the agent(s) of the activity, and object refers to the \*problem space toward which the activity is directed. It should be noted that \*the motive is embedded in the object of the activity" (Engestrom, 2000 p. 964), which drives the activity. The activity entails transforming the object into an outcome and is mediated by artefacts including sigs and tools as well as rules (e.g., norms, rubrics, and guidelines), community such as university and program, and division of labor such as advisors and peers. Rules, community and division of labor underlie the contextual and social dimensions of an activity. In an activity system, all mediators and mediated actions are intertwined and should be viewed in a holistic manner (Lei, 2008). Activity systems are not static; they undergo ongoing changes and transformation through interactions (Russell, 1997).

Key to Engestrom's (1987, 199) activity system analysis isthe notion of contradictions, which manifest themselves as \*problems ruptures, breakdowns, clashes" (Kuutt, 1996, p. 34). Activit systems are filled with contradictions, which either exist within an activity ystem (.e., within an activity system component or between components), or between different activity systems (Engestrom, 1987, 1999). For instance, a person's identity as an L novice writer in their discipline may be in conflict with the need to writ like an expert required of their assinment task (Li, 2013). Contradictions can motivate indviduals toward different directions, and can cause problems to the activity. However, resolutions of the contradictions serve as the sources of change and development. As Li (2013) puts it, "Internal dissonance fundamentally characterizes an activity system and fuels changes in the system" (p. 74).

The application of AT to L2 writing research has been increasing in recent years. For example, AT perspective has guided an examination of an international student's PhD process (Zhu, 2016) where the process was conceptualized as evolving and entailing two phases: the initial learning cycle and the disertation cycle, each with distinctie contradictions. A contradiction evident in the dissertation cycle of the PhD process, for example, existed between the problem space/object (ie, connections between computer-mediated pre-writing discussion and writing) and the lack of readily available analytical framework (mediating artefact to investigate the problem space. Scafolded by relevant research, the PhD student was able to resolve the contrdiction by creating an analytical procedure which captured both the levels and the strengths of textual connections betwen students computer-mediated pre-writing discussions and subsequent writing. The resolution of the contradiction contributed to the PhD student's learning and development as a researcher. AT has aso provided a theoretical lens for examining the writing for publication processby three Chinese science postdoctoral researchers in America (Li, 2012). The mediational trategies were artefact-mediated (using various tools and L2) rule-mediated (adhering to the publication norms), community-mediated (socializing with people from academic and editorial communities), and role-mediated (being an author and researcher).

AT has afforded a new conceptualization of writing strategies and has inspired and informed a growing body of L2 writing strategy research. More specificall, from an AT perspective,strategies that mediate writing (i.e, mediational strategies for writing) are conceptualized as mediated actions or use of mediational resources afforded in activity systems (Lei, 2008). Emphasizing the socio cultural and sociohistorical dimensions of learning, these strategies go beyond the traditionally reported L2 acquisition strategies which focus on affective, cognitive, and metacognitive strategies (e.g., Lee, 2010; O'Malley & Chamot, 1990; Oxford, 1990).

Fig. 1. Activity system (based on Engestrom, 1999).

AT-informed writing strategy research focuses on how participants use resources aforded by the various mediators (artfacts, rules community and division of labor) in the activity system to transform the object of their activity into the outcome and/or to resolve contradictions in the activity. Notably, Lei (2008) focused on two Chinese proficient undergraduate students' assgnments from a writing course and analyzed the ways the two students mediated their writing processes with diverse resources. Lei identified four types of strategies, namely, artefact-mediated (Internet, use of literary works), rule-mediated (evaluation criteria, time), community-mediated (campus community, society community), and role-mediated strategies (author, language learner).

In another study, Lei (2016) investigated writing strategies in skilled and les skilled English majors at a Chinese university and found the two groups used the same artefact-mediation (e.g., literary works, Internet, L1, and L2) and rule-mediation (e.g., rhetoric, critria for good writing, and exam rules but difered in role and community-mediated strategie. While silled writersassumed roles of language learners and authors who took responsibilit for their writing and tried to learn L2 through writing, les siled writers acted as task doers, only aiming to finish the task (role mediation). Further, les siled writers were found to communicate only with their teachers and peers while more skilled writers aso reached out to other social agents (community mediation). Li (2013) studied three undergraduate ESL learners source-based writing in the context of a political science course. The study revealed that i order to achieve the outcome, i.e., the policy paper in question, the students utilized numerous strategies, such as rule-related strategies (assignment guidelines; academic conventions), community-related strategies (class and institutional culture), and division of labor-related strategies (instructors giving assignment and feedback and student completing assignment).

AT-informed L2 writing strategy research has also provided insight into strategies employed by graduate students to accomplish academic writing tasks. Park and De Costa (2015) analyzed writing strategies used in academic papers written by an MA student from Nepal studying at an US university. Their study concluded that the student adopted various tool, rule, and community-mediated strategies which were driven by her goals and motives. Further, the strategies interacted with each other in the context of the stu. dent's social and cultural environments, whilecontradictions were also found in the participant's writing activity. For example, she knew it was desirable to use diverse expressions but her language proficiency prevented her from doing so. Kesser (2020) focused on the digital composing proces of two Chinese ESL doctoral writrs as they completed courseassignments in the first semester of their studies. He found that in regard to technology use, the two students employed multimodal strategies (highlighting, colored font) as well as tool mediated strategies for language (online dictionary) and content (Mendeley, Wikipedia) development.

2.2. Graduation thesis of English majors in China and academic writing research on Chinese EFL undergraduate.

Per the Curiculum Standards of English Teaching for English Programs in Tertiary Instittions (Education Department of China, 2006), English majors in China have to complet a research paper in English of between 3000-5000 words to met one of the graduation requirements. Acording to the graduation thesis guidelines of the universty where the participant of the study was enrolled, the Whole process lasts for two semesters. In the fall of the senior year, students start with topic selection and the proposal. At the beginning of the spring semester, they submit the initial drafts t their advisor, and then revise based on feedback and comment for a few rounds. Toward the end of spring, the students are expected to submit the final drafts and defend their theses. The task requires students to write data-driven research paper, which is considered the most substantial project English majors would undertake during their undergraduate studies. The principles students are supposed to follow when selecting topics are that topics need to closely relate to the courses taken and/or that topics address current social events and phenomena.

There has ben a rather extensive amount of research investigating Chinese EFL undergraduates academic writing, mostly focusing on argumentative and expository genres (.g., Bychkovska & Lee, 2017; Liardet, 2018; Liu & Braine, 2005; Pei et al., 2017; ang & Sun, 2012; Zhang & Zhan, 2020; Zha0, 2017). Research focusing on data-based research writing in Chinese L2 context is very limited. Lee and Chen (2009) and Hyland (2002) examined undergraduates' graduation papers in English employing corpus tool t investigate the linguistic features rather than probing writing strategies. Given the scarce attention paid to writers research-based writing at the undergraduate level, we have littl understanding of the writing trategies novice writer use to mediate their writing. How this group of writers apropriate available resources during their research writing activity in their sociocultural context remains an underexplored area in the current academia. AT focuses on human activity in its sociocultural context and provides a useful framework for examining mediation and mediational resource inthe activity system. Further, AT emphasies the inteconnectednes and interaction of the components of an activity system. Using AT as the theoretical framework allows us to investigate how students utilize medational resources in the activity system to mediate their graduation paper writing activity and how the interaction of the activity system components influences their activity, thus leading to a deepened understanding of graduation paper writing. Therefore, inspired by previous AT-informed studies on writing strategies, this study aims to investigate the following questions:

1) What kinds of mediating strategies does a Chinese undergraduate EFL writer use in her graduation thesis writing?   
2) What contradictions exist in the student's writing activity?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Context

This study took place at a key public universty in China, which offrs four-year undergraduate program in English. The program designates a range of courses aiming to foster students' ability in listening, speaking, translation, reading, and writing. Courses specificll centering on writig are general English writing courses corresponding to thre levels (basic, intermediate, and advanced), which primaril focus on argumentative writing of around 300 words. The English Academic Writing course, however, i offered inthe freshman year. The course is not specifically designed for graduation thesis writing. It mainly covers the format of research-based academic papers, such as the citation format and the structure frame of academic writing. The undergraduate program requires English majors to write a graduation thesis of at least 600 words in the main body part based on research. The areas of focus encompass English linguisics translation studies, British and American literature, and English language pedagogy. During the two semesters when the students work on the paper, no courses related to academic reading and writing are offered.

# 3.2. Participant

In summer 2021, the first author (Ren) reached out o a former colleague f hers who is a lectrer at the university. At that time, she was supervising two senior students graduation theses. Ren then sought the two students consent to participate in a study related to their graduation theses. Both agreed to participate. The participant reported i the current study, Wendy (pseudonym) was selected, because interviews with her offered richer data.

At the time of data collection, Wendy was 22 years old. She was a senior English-major student at the university. She started learning English in elementary school. Wendy was admitted into the English department ater the College Entrance Exam in 2017. She scored $^ { 8 0 + }$ out of 100 in the TEM-4 (Test for English Majors - Band 4), which exceeded scores of most of her peers. Wendy's English writing experience mainly revolved around course assgnments and project, with lite experience related to reearch writing; furter, she barely received feedback regarding those assgnments from the writing teachers except scores ranging from 88 to 90 out of 100, which indicated that her English writing proficiency was at the advanced level. Ater graduation, Wendy would continue to study for her master's degree specializing in English linguistics at another key university in China.

# 3.3. Data collection

Multiple sources of data were utilized in the study: a background interview (BI), an interview about the paper (PI), and an advisor interview (AI). During the interviews, Ren constantly asked clarification questions to ensure the accuracy of the data. For example, after conducting the background interview, Ren found Wendy's ideas toward her writing classes unclear, so in the subsequent interview, she prompted Wendy to recount those ideas and to compare the writing classes she took. All the interviews were semistructured, and were conducted virtuall in Chinese and audio-recorded. The interview guidelines can be found in the Appendices. Textual data materials include Wendy's graduation thesis and the thesis guidelines. The timeline of data colection is displayed in Table 1.

Background interview (BI): The main aim of the background interview was to get to know the profile of the participant's English learning experience, with a particular focus on writing. The themes covered included Wendy's learning and writing history, interest, goals of studying English, courses taken, and self-assesment of weaknesses and strengths in English. The information about Wendy writing the graduation paper was briefly elicited inthe background interview. The background interview was conducted with Wendy before she sent Ren her paper.

Interview about the paper (PI): After reviewing Wendy's graduation thesis, an interview regarding the paper was conducted. The questions revolved around the specific reasons for topic selection, words selection, the difficulties and challenges encountered during writing, efort to deal with them, and so on. Two rounds of follow-up interviews (Fl) were conducte toclarify information obtained in the interview.

Advisor interview (AI): In order to understand Wendy's thesis writing from diffrent perspectives, Ren conducted an interview with the advisor, who was highly involved and played an indispensable role in the process. Questions were mainly concerned with the advisor'sevaluations of Wendy's writing, her expectations, her foci when giving fedback, her considerations when advising students, and so on.

# 3.4. Researcher positioning

It is generally expected that the qualitatie case study report incudes some discussion about the researchers reflexivity concerning different aspects of the reearch, such as the researcher's elationship with the reearch phenomenon and the participants (Duff, 2008, 2014). As sated, the first author contacted the participant and collected the data. As a researcher who used to be an English major at a Chinese universty and who went through the undergraduate thesis writing process she viewed herself as an insider of this writing task. The experience cultivated her interest in approaching this writing activity from a researcher's perspective. Sharing this expe rience, she was able to empathize with Wendy. Similar inguistic and learning background helped Ren build rapport with Wendy during the data collection process Beides, Ren assumed the dual role of reearcher-s-befriender and reearchr-s-resource Candin Sarangi, 2003); the first helped create a relaxing atmosphere encouraging the participant to talk freely and reflectively about her writing experience. Ren also offred to proofread for Wendy in the future and to discuss questions Wendy may have in her future graduate studies.

# 3.5. Data analysis

The interviews were first transcribed using online tools (https://app.xunjiepdf.com/voice2text/); then the rough transcriptions were reviewed and corrected by the first author. When reporting the results, th original interviews were translated into English. Based on information from the background interview, Wendy's profile, presented under the "participant" section, was built.

Data collected from Wendy constituted the main data sources, which were analyzed iteratively to answer the research questions. At the initial stage, Ren read the transcriptions a few times in order to get an overall grasp of the interviews and adopted an inductive approach to assgn codes to the interview transcripts (Dornyei, 2007). For example, in the paper interview, Wendy reported that to write a part of her paper, she referred to news reports from a news agency, which generated a code named "news report mediated strategy" In the background interview, Wendy stated she could only think in L2, even when writing the abstract of her graduation paper where a Chinese version was also needed. This was categorized as "L2 mediated strategy". Next, Ren grouped related codes emergent from the data, with a particular focus on those that arerelevant to the AT framework. Data were recursively examined until all related codes were included. Then, the identified codes were mapped onto the activity system framework (Engestrom, 1987, 1999) to understand Wendy's thesis writing activity and writing strategies, namely artefact-mediated, rule-mediated, community-mediated, and role-mediated strategies (Lei, 208). For instance, the above mentioned two examples ultimately fell under the category of artefact mediated strategy. Wendy's purpose/goal statements in the interviews were analyzed to understand her motive for the writing a. tivity. The statements regarding gaps in knowledge, challenges in writing, and her frustrations provided data for the examination of contradictions in her thesis writing activity.

The interview with the advisor provided additional insights into Wendy's graduation paper writing activity. We particularly focused on the advisor's observations and evaluations of Wendy's writing activity to triangulate the student's strategy use. For instance, that the advisor commented on advising the students to consult writing models supported Wendy's reported use of this strategy. Wendy's graduation paper was examined in regard to its rhetorical structure, language use, and format, and features noted were probed in the interview about the paper. For example, Wendy exclusively used we for self-representation, and questions related to this were asked during the interview.

In order to address the trustworthiness of the study (Lincoln & Guba, 1985), we employed several strategies including data triangulation, peer checking, and respondent feedback (Dornyei, 2007). Multiple sources of data were employed to triangulate the analysis, and the rearchers iscussed data analysis, with the codes verified by the co-author. Further, when relevant, the irst author confirmed her understanding and interpretations of Wendy's interview comments with Wendy.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Graduation paper writing: A challenge for the novice writer

Wendy's graduation paper revolved around hedges used in news reports extracted from an Australian newspaper. Wendy chose this topic because she thought this one was relatively easy afer skimming through articles for potential research directions. Around the time of her writing the paper, the Belt and Road Initiative policy advocated by the Chinese government was vetoed by Australia, which aroused heated discussion. Wendy selected 50 pieces of news about this issue as the data to keep up with the contemporary social situation. Her paper (main body) consisted of 11,525 words, and encompassed eight sections: introduction, literature review, theoretical framework, methodology, research results and discussion, pragmatic functions of hedge, realization of pragmatic functions from adaptation theory, and conclusion.

As a novice writer, Wendy encountered numerous difficulties in this writing activity. She wasat a los how to write the paper (PI) particularly due to difficulties related to understanding her advisor's fedack, finding a \*pefect paper exemplar that could scaffold her writing the literature review, and applying rules specified in the thesis guidelines, which willbe discussed below. As a novice academic writer lacking sufficient conctual knowledge of reearch writing, to et into a discourse [she can only partiall imagine" (Bartholomae, 1986, p.19) was fraught with distress, sense of self-doubt, and confusion.

# 4.2. The object of Wendy's activity

In Wendy's writing activity, the "problem space" was the graduation paper of 600 words minimum, which is a complete research paper that follows conventional empirical research writig procedures and structure. Specificall, the focus of Wendy's paper was on the analysis of hedges used in news discourse, as stated in Wendy's thesis:

This study trie to explore the realization of the pragmatic functions of hedges used, taking 50 pieces of news reports about the Belt and Road Initiative from The Australian as language data. (final paper)

Wendy's primary motive was instrumental - she aimed to complete the graduation paper, sucessfully defend it, and graduate on time: \*When  wrote it, just wanted to get i done, revise and submit i, and then pass the evaluation. I didnt ivet too much thought"

(PI).

Wendy employed various strategies in her graduation paper writing activity.

# 4.3. Artefact-mediated strategies

Wendy used multiple artefact-mediated strategies when writing the paper. As artefact-mediated strategies can be further cate. gorized into ign- and tool-mediated strategies, it was found that Wendy mainl resorted to L2 as sign-mediated strategies, and drew on published journal articles, MA theses, and news reports from the Xinua News Agency as tool-mediated strategies. These strategies are explicated in this subsection.

# 4.3.1. L2-mediated strategy

L2 played an important mediating role when Wendy completed written assgnments in English. Realizing the differences between English and Chinese, Wendy stated that writing in her L1 posed challenges instead of bringing benefit to her English writing. Wendy indicated that she could use L2 to organize ideas and express meaning more accurately,

Ihave a habit - if I write English compositions, I have to write in Englis firs. If I writ in Chinese first, then I dont know how to translate it back to the English words I want. So I try to think in an English way, which can reflect more what I want to expres. (PI)

With regard to her graduation paper, she specificall offered an example of the Abstract, which required both Chinese and English versions. Wendy reorted she had to write the English version firs: \*When I wote my graduation paper, such as the Astract .I have to write the English version first. f Iwrite in Chinese irt, I don't know how to writ a complete version of the English abstrct (PI).

# 4.3.2. Journal article mediated strategy

As Wendy's paper focused on the use of hedges in news discourse, adopting a framework with which to interpret the pragmatic functions of hedges was important. Wendy resorted to journal articles focusing on different kinds of discourse to frame the pragmatic functions. From the journal articles consulted, she was able to integrate aframework and apply it to her paper. The mediation of journal articles in Wendy's writing activity is illustrated in the following extract:

When writing the pragmatic functions in Chapter 6, I referred to a Chinese scholar's research back in around 2010, which centered on legal discourse. He summarized several pragmatic functions. I also referred to some scholars studies that focused on news discourse, and its language functions. I synthesized six functions based on those studies. (PI)

# 4.3.3. MA thesis mediated strategy

Besides journal articles that offered rich information in terms of theoretical underpinnings, Wendy stated that fllowing her advisor's feedback, she resorted to MA theses extensively for the purpose of gaining an understanding of the rhetorical tructure and components of a graduation paper. Wendy's use of MA theses as mediating resources for the rhetoricalstructure of her paper perhaps reflected learning from her advisor, who atached great importance to the model paper/s her students used and who employed model papers as pedagogical tools. The advisor tated during the advisor interview: \*They have model papers. I would teach them how to analyze the papers and what they are expected to write (Al). For Wendy, the most important model paper was an MA thesis whose topic was also on hedges: The MA thesis also focused on hedges. It was from xx Universty .. I mainly followed the structure of the thesis"; in particular, Wendy noted she "wrote the methodology and analysis sections based on that thesis" (PI).

For a novice writer of the empirical research paper genre, this model paper scaffolded Wendy's understanding of the rhetorical structure and conventions of research writing. She noted that she observed strategies for writing the resuls section from the MA thesis and emulated those stratgies in her own writing: The rhetorical structure of Wendy' reults section was highly retitive; esntiall it involved presenting one or two examples at a time, followed by interpretation of the example/s.

# 4.3.4. News report mediated strategy

Wendy did not only resort to academic discourse when writing her graduation paper. Since her paper concentrated on news reports she referred to a newspaper ssued by an officia hinese news agency. As she was asked to insert her personal opinions regarding the news reports she selected for her paper, she built her ideas on information from this official news platorm. Wendy explained this mediation process \*My advisor asked me t add China's atitudes. I ccidently saw the news from Xinhua News Agency, so I wrote it in my paper accordingly" (PI).

# 4.4. Rule-mediated strategies

The data revealed that Wendy's paper was shaped by two rule-mediated strategies: the specific rules set by her program and the generally-recognized rhetorical conventions she was expected to follow when writing a data-based research paper.

# 4.4.1. Program guidelines

Wendy's undergraduate program prescribed sringent rules regarding the format of the paper, which was synthesized in a PDF file and distrbuted to the students. The rules stpulated the format of a successul paper, including front page, table of content, indentation, font, word limit, reference list,cittion styles based on APA format However, detailed as the guidelines semed to be, when it came to the rules of citations, they did not scesfully mediate Wendy's writing activity, as she thought they were to specific and complex. They brought her more frustrations when she tried to conform to the program rules only to end up with geting more disoriented. Wendy commented on her difficulty with complying with citation-related rules: There definitely are a lot of mistakes in References, because the APA format was difficult. Some words should be italicized. The year of the ited published works was probably mistaken too" (PI).

# 4.4.2. Academic conventions

In order to write her graduation paper, Wendy tried to follow the conventions concerning the rhetorical structure of research writing from the broader academic world. However, her paper showed only partiallysuccessful mediation of this writing strategy. As mentioned, Wendy's paper consisted of eight sections, demonstrating the essential rhetorical components of her paper. However, two chapters named Pragmatic functions of hedges and Realization of pragmatic functions from adaptation theory were presented afer Results and discussion. When reflecting on this somewhat unconventional structure in the follow-up interview, Wendy remarked, Now that I recal .. I think they belong to the Results and discussion. I should have included them in the results" (FI).

# 4.5.  Community-mediated strategies

Wendy actively communicated with her peer when writing the paper, and she also received feedback and comment from more established figures in her community including her advisor, the reviewer, and the commitee. These two groups underlay the community-mediated strategies Wendy resorted to.

# 4.5.1. Comments and feedback from senior researchers

According to Wendy, she received feedback and comments mainly from three groups of readers: her advisor, one reviewer from blind review and the commitee, which was composed of instructors specializing in English linguistics from her department. As stated by Wendy, among comments from these thre groups, the ones provided by the advisor were the most thorough and beneficial" (PI). The modes of feedback provision ranged from adding comments in the electronic document of the drafts to oral comments in revising sessions in the teacher's ofice. Assuming akey rol of feedack provider in Wendys writing activit, the advisor primaril focused on 'the meaning of sentences and sentence connections, the prominence of the key points, use of citations to support or rebut an argument, the structure of the paper, the analysis, and relevant theory and research' (Al). She also made suggestions on Wendy's inter pretation of the data used. One piece of the advisor'sfeedack was about the neutralit of the news reports analyzed in Wendy's paper. She suggested that Wendy add interpretations on the news extract from China's perspective. Wendy fllowed the suggestion, and wrote in the implication section,

This move not only violates the spirit of the contract, but also highlights Australia's irationality, which will undoubtedy worsen relations between the two countrie .. It is necessary for Australia to correctly look at China's development, reduce misunderstandings and prejudices, strengthen mutual understanding and trust. (final paper)

Though Wendy thought her advisor's feedback helped mold her writing extensively, she could not full understand the comments sometimes, so she actively engaged herself in the revision process and sought clarifications from the advisor: \*My advisor said itll be better if you write this way.' But that was not clear to me .. I had to revise a few times. Eventually therell be one version that's acceptable (PI). The advisor aso commented: Afer I gave comments on Wendy's draft, next time when we met, she'd write down some questions and show me her revision. She'd doublecheck with me, To me this means this, right?" (AI).

The comments from the blind reviewer were more focused on citation formats. For example, Wendy did not specify the source of the graphs she borrowed from previous studies, which was circled by the reviewer, and Wendy revised acordingly. The thesis defense, however, was a brief and simple event that did not focus much on the details of Wendy's study. The commitee mainly focused on the format such as the presentation of the graphs, which helped Wendy work on those minor issues after the defense.

# 4.5.2. Peer collaboration

Peer collboration helped mediate Wendy's paper writing, though to a lesser degree. Wendy sought a peer's help to code some words whose pragmatic functions she was uncertain of when analyzing the data. She reported that \*When I categorized my dat .. I had to ask for my per's opinions .. ecause language can be very subjective. f she agreed with me, I would label those words in the corresponding category" (PI). The advisor commented on this per scaffolding, saying ". the other student (another advisee of the advisor's) helped Wendy with the analysis .. It's heartening to see they were helping each other'" (AI).

What is worth pointing out is that Wendy's collaboration with her peer was only limited to data coding. Her peers were not involved in checking language use in the paper, even though her advisor recommended that the students proofread for each other. Wendy explained that asking for peers' help with language use would only bring each other more burden:

My teacher asked us to do that (proofread for each other), but reading my own paper already gave me a headache. And our language use styles are different, so maybe you find others papers odd. How can I expect them to prooread for me? Probably the most they could do is to look for some grammatical mistakes. (PI)

Moreover, not asking for peers' help had been a taken-for-granted rule in Wendy's peer community. She shared that when they were asked to profread for each other in a writig clas it could not ttain the expected effect: .. at that time, no one was really talking about your writing. Mostly they were just chatting or saying, Oh, here you did a very good job'. So you relly can't expect to make improvements through asking peers to proofread for you' (BI).

# 4.6. Role-mediated strategies

Wendy's writing activity was mediated with two roles she identified herself with: as a Chinese citizen and an undergraduate student.

# 4.6.1. Role as a Chinese citizen

Wendy's paper focused on the hedges used in an Australian newspaper and analyzed how this linguistic device was used to attain rhetorical and pragmatic purposes. Wendy commented that this newspaper was based in Australia; therefore, the language choices were more favorable toward Australia rather than China. Being a Chinese citizen prompted Wendy to take into account the inter. national situations and to take a stance she perceived to be desirable for China and Chinese people. She said, \*Toward the end of the paper .. my advisor asked me to add some analysis from China's perspective .. s a hinese student writing a paper in China, I should write something in favor of the country' (PI).

Her identification as a Chinese citizen was made clear by the pronouns she chose. In her paper, she used we" and "our to point out the position she aligned herself with. For example, she wrote,

... we can try to analyze Australia's policy towards China and then foster our political sensitivity.

Taking hedges used in Australian newspaper as an entry point, we can speculate something about Austrlia's attitude towards China's Belt and Road Initiative. (final paper)

# 4.6.2. Role as an undergraduate student

Realizing her identity as an undergraduate student, Wendy consciously avoided the use of assertive modal verbs, since she was concerned this would probably position her as an arrogant writer. Instead, hedges such as "may", "appear to'" and "to some extent' were selected:

1 this way, China's attitude may be misunderstood, and may sound aggressive to some extent.

Hedges may appear to enjoy different functions, as well as frequencies in different linguistic data. (final pape

Wendy commented on her use of hedges:

You can see that .. I used a lot of may or could, because as a student I dare not use must. I will use some expressions that are acceptable, so you willnot get the feling that how come this student is so arrogant and use words like must etc. I use more moderate tones. (PI)

# 4.7. Contradictions in Wendy's writing activity

The analysis of data revealed that contradictions existed both within the graduation thesis writing activity system and beyond the activity system. The difficulties posed to Wendy in this activity were reflected in those contradictions. In this section, we present the contradictions to address the second research question.

# 4.7.1. Contradictions within the writing activity system

Rule mediation and object. One contradiction existed between the rule-mediated strategies and the object. As Wendy was a novice academic writr, she was aware that there was a whole set of aademic conventions she was expected to follow. Although the rules were explicitly pelle out by her program in the guidelines, the complexties of correctly aplying those rules to her writing tharted Wndys effrt. fer trying but ending up with falure, Wendy gave up on thefforts to make her paper eror fr t was so nnoying tht thee ws so much that nede to be reised . and odiffilt .somany rouns of eisions and unscesul effrt. didn't want to revise further (PI). As mentioned in the rule-mediated strategie section, mistakes were not completely eliminated in References, because the citation rules were too complicated to follow for her.

Another contradiction was reflected in \*rules" not available to Wendy but were nevertheles important to writing activity. Lack of concetual knowledge of the norms of target iscourse impacted Wendy's perception of a successul graduation paper, which affected her own writing: "I'm only $5 0 \%$ satisfied with the paper, because I don't know how to write it. I don't know what the norms are. I couldn't find a paper that's exceptionally good. You don't have a norm. Without it I fel not confident with my own writing" (PI).

Thus, on the one hand, rules provided by the program did not effectively mediate Wendy's writing activity. On the other hand norms that could have mediated Wendy's transformation of the object were not available to her.

Artefact mediation and object. Contradictions did not solely exist on the lines of rule-mediated strategies. Wendy referred to journal articles when writing the literature review, but she found it extremely difficult t synthesize the literature. The help she could acquire from using this artefact-mediated strategy was limited, since it was not clear to Wendy how jounal articles as a genre, were similar to the genre she was required to perform: \*My advisor asked me to continue reading journal articles published in English, such as learning from them how to cite, how to writ literature review, which wil be helpful. But that's journal artice. How to write an undergraduate paper? I still don't know" (PI).

The unsuccessful artefact mediation in Wendy's writing the Literature review was also reflected in the advisor's comment on this section. By and large, the advisor found the paper satisfactory, but she was sightly critical of the litrature review: \*She is good in general. But, as to literature reading and writing, she didn't do very well' (AI).

Role mediation and object. In Wendy's eyes, as a senior undergraduate student, she did not have adequate research writing skils and expertise to writea full-scale research paper. To her, she did not understand what stances she should ssume in the paper or what should be conveyed through the paper. \*About witing the paper ..Ifel... what should I express I couldn't find it. I jus wrote the paper. For students like us, undergraduate students, are we voicing ourselves in the paper? Everybody seems to write the same way' (PI).

# 4.7.2. Contradictions beyond the writing activity system

In addition to the contradictions demonstrated within Wendy's writing activity, a contradiction across activity systems was conspicuously manifested in the data. That Wendy found it dificult to write her graduation thesis was related to the course infra structure in the program. Her program offered a one-semester academic writing classin her freshman year although itintroduced the structure frame of academic writing, it paid scare attention to language or the rhetorical structure of academic writing on a microscale level: -We didn't learn (academic) language in that course .. we didn't even learn the wording or phrasing, or how to write a paragraph. I just don't understand (how to write an academic paper) (PI).

As mentioned earlier, the course was not designed for graduation paper writing. In the course, Wendy was required to submt academic writing of 300-400 words which were completed during class According to her, the writing asignments did not sucessuly mediate her thesis writing activity because of the diffrent nature of the two tasks: The papers we wrote in that clss were like the length of an eay - 300-400 or les than 500 words . but the graduation paper is way longer, so the assinments couldn't necessarily reflect the graduation paper, because structurally, you can't scale up the former to get the latter" (FI).

Another factor that contributed to the contradiction i the time this course was taught in Wendy's program. Taking the EAP writing course in the freshman year and writing the graduation paper thre years ater minimized the possbility of positive transfer: The course . probably didn't play role because it'sbeen three years before we started writig the graduation paper. The direct inluence is very little' (FI).

Taken together, Wendy's activity system is llustrated in Fig.2, which represents the application of the Activity Theory framework displayed in Fig. 1 to Wendy's graduation paper writing. Fig. 2 presents the components of Wendy's activity system and the specific mediating rources (., mediating strateies)Wendy usd in hr writing activity, as cussed above in the Rults sectin. ote that the curved lines in Fig. 2 indicate the contradictions within and beyond Wendy's graduation paper writing activity.

# 5. Discussion

As the results reveal, driven by the goal to pass the evaluation, Wendy adopted artefact, rule, community, and role mediated strategies to write her graduation paper. The community-mediated strategies she used (seniors feedback and peer's help) were partill congruent with thoseof the more experienced writers (namely graduate students as reported in previous AT-informed studies (e.g., Kessler, 2020; Park & De Costa, 2015). However, compared with the participant in Park and De Costa's study who attempted to use other community resources in the broader institutional context (., writing center on campus) but eentuall faile to aes this service, Wendy sought to use a more limited set of community-related resources bound to the advisor and her peer. Rule mediations in

Fig. 2. Wendy's graduation paper writing activity.

Wendy's case were similar to those found in Park and De Costa's study: both students followed the rules from the writing guidelines and writing conventions in the larger academic environment.

Similarities and differences can also be found between this study and previous AT-informed L2 writig strategy research examining undergraduate student writers (e.g, Li, 2013). For example, Wendy's rule mediations were consistent with those used by one indvidual in Li's study (in terms of following both assgnment guidelines and conventions of academic writing). However, some of Wendy's strategies differe from those of other studie. Per feedback was found to be a common strategy to tackle languag isues in previous research (Kang & Pyun, 2013). The locus of pr feedback i the current study, however, sems different as Wendy employed this strategy exclusively to code data, which reflected the nature of the writing task. As far as the artefact-mediated strategies are concerned, Wendy reported that she exclusively thought in and used L2 when she composed in English. This i different from Lei's (2008) study where two junior undergraduates writing activity was the focus, and where both students used L1 extensively as the mediating artefact. Language proficiency may have played a role here since Wendy was at a more advanced level of undergraduate study compared to the participants in Lei's study. Additionall, individual differences may have also contributed to the writers different employment of artefact-mediated strategies.

It is evident that Wendy's mediating strategies were not emergent in a vacuum but were informed and shaped by the larger social. political and academic contexts. One strategy not previously reported but emerged from the data concerns how Wendy's role as a Chinese citizen mediated her paper writing. This finding indicate that the roles a student ssumes in the Division of Labor component of a writing activity system encompass those beyond the academic writing environment, and the roles index the multi-dimensions of writer identities. Viewed from the perspective of Ivanic's (198) writer identity framework, being a citizen is one's autobiographical self (one's real-world identit), which influences the discoursal self, the identity emergent from one's writing. In Wendy'scase, the citizen role contributed to the manifestation of her writer identity in her paper. Further, as the writing activity was embedded in a particular academic context, Wendy's reluctance to ask for peer's help for proofreading resulted from observing a practice in the community environment, which also demonstrates the influence of contextual factors on writing activity and writing strategy use.

From the perspective of Activity Theory, mediating strategies are oriented by the goals a subject has. Therefore, writing strategies should be "analyzed in reference to the goals people have to motivate and guide their task performance" (Cumming et al., 2002, p. 193). In Wendy's case, her primary goal for this graduation paper was performance-oriented (Cumming, 2006; Storch, 2004): She simply aimed to complete the paper, pass the evaluation and successully obtain her bachelor's degree. This goal influenced her adoption of writing strategies and the outcome of the activity. For example, in order to write a paper that was deemed acceptable by the discourse comunt ie., the committe, she made someffort to follow the rules precribed y the program (i.e, ule-mediated strategy). Paradoxically, the motive of just to do an adequate job to pass the evaluation, along with the complexties of the program rules, also prompted her to stop short of applying those rules in her paper thoroughly and successfully.

According to Activity Theory, contradictions are inevitable in an activity system and can arise both within and across activity systems. This was demonstrated in Wendy's case. Within-system contradictions, namely inner contradictions, lay between the object and the mediators (artefact, rule, and role). Wendy did not flly understand the norms regarding the graduation paper or the academic writing rules she was expected to apply in her paper, and she was not confident in her identity as an underraduate student to complete such a reserch project Further, Wendys graduation paper writing activity was in conflict wth her coursework activity in the program since coursework in her program did not adequately prepare students for writing the graduation thesis. This contradiction was beyond Wendy, an undergraduate student, or her graduation thesis writing community to resolve. Contradictions provide a source of learning if uccessully resolved (Engestrom, 1987, 1999). However, in Wendy's case, the contradictions were not resolved but persisted, constraining her transformation of the object of her writing activity into outcome and, perhaps equally importantly, her transformation and development as an academic writer.

This study contribute to the current body of L2 writing strategy research in several ways. First, adopting Activity Theory as the analytical lens, it has extended L2 writing strategy research by examining an undergraduate student undertaking a data-driven research writing task in the Chinese EFL context, a phenomenon underexplored in current research. An AT-informed examination provided insights into the strategies the novice writer used to mediate her performing a new research writing task in a specific so. ciocultural context, as well as the intrcate connections between strategy use, writer's goal, and the context in which the writing activity was embedded. Second, this study has shed light on the writer's societal role in the writing activity and thus revealed complexities of role mediation, indicating the multilayerednes of role that could influence the transformation of the object e., writing outcome). Third, the in-depth analysis of one case brought to light the deep-seated contradictions not only within the writing activity, but also between related activity/ies. In particular, the contradiction between the student's writing activity and the coursework infrastructure was not reported previously and deserves atention. Findings of the study also raise some important questions: How can we help students indentify and utilize mediational strategies when they are fist introduced to a writing task? When students are unable to resolve the contradictions, what roles can advisors/program play to facilitate the resolution of contradictions?

However, this study has it limitations. Despite efforts to collect multiple sources of data, the final paper and the interviews constituted the primary data sources for the study. As graduation paper writing i a proces, a longitudinal design tracking Wendy's mediating trategies and contradictions across dferent phases and draft of writing may have offeed aditional insights and a fuller understanding about her writing strategies and development as a writer. Future studies may adopt longitudinal designs and also consider investigating advisors' perceptions of and attitudes toward the undergraduate graduation paper and students use of strategies during the writing process to gain more insights. The present study was based on data from one participant in one specific context; future research may include more participants and focus on other writing contexts to examine variations in strategy use.

This study offers several pedagogical insights for advisors, writing programs, and writing teachers to consider. Although going through the proces of writing a research-based graduation paper could be beneficial for undergraduate, particularly those who would pursue apostgraduate degre, composing a full-blown research paper for the first time is an arduous task for novice writers and may e fraught with confusion and frustration. As such, advisors, writing programs and teachers may pay more attention to how to supporthe student witers so that they can carry out their witing ctivity successully. Wendy's case reveals that novice writers need knowledge of the norms and conventions pertaining to the writing task to perform it. To support students knowledge development, writing programs can design their curricula more effctively to ensure that course content and sequencing address the needs of the students. Advisors, writing teachers, and writing programs may also consider how to provide more effective rule mediation. In Wendy's case, although rules were provided by the program, their complexities preventedWendy from implementing them fully This indicates that simply providing a set of rules (guidelines) may not constitute efective mediation. How to introduce the rules in a meaningful and contextualized manner meris consideration. One strategy may be to offer examples in academic writing classes and provide students with opportunities to practice applying the rules in class. After-class workshops can also be used to provide additional support for novice writers. Teachers could also offer more individualized feedback on citation rules based on students ability. Overall, advisors could consider how to provide more scaffolding in the area of citation format of academic conventions, as this seems an aspect which undergraduates need to be extremely conscientious about.

# 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented Wendy's writing strategies in graduation paper writing through the lens of Activity Theory. As the results demonstrated, Wendy's writing activity was mediated by a variety of trategie including artefact, rule, community, and role related strategies. These strategies were rooted in her sociocultural context, and were inextricably related to the motives and goals Wendy held for her paper. Further, contradictions were found between the object and the various mediators within the activity system and between the research writing activity system and courseinfrastructure. By focusing on the graduation paper writing activit,this study highlights that students efoming ew rerch writing task may mee difficulties that ae byond their capacit to reolve, as they may not have the full range of mediational resources they need, and resources available to them may not alleffectively mediate their writing. Contradictions may exist extensively, which impede the writing actvity, affct writing quality and dampen students writing enthusiasm. Continued research would provide further insights into novice writers' research writing strategies and activities.
