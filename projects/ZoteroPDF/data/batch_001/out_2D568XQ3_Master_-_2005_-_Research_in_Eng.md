# INTRODUCTION

The domain of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) has had a strong research tradition since its inception in the 1960s. This chapter delineates the current research concerns of ESP in order to gain a sense of the direction in which the field is moving, with a special focus on the years 2000-2002. The information is gleaned primarily from the pages of the flagship journal of the field, English for Specific Purposes, which editors of the journal have often used as an indicator of major trends in the field (e.g., Dudley-Evans, 2001; Hewings, 2002; Master, 2001). The chapter surveys data-based studies as well as descriptions of ESP programs and environments, such as shadowing a business manager. It then examines current issues that concern the field and concludes with an investigation of the most significant research question that can be asked about ESP: Does it work?

# RESEARCH DOMAIN

ESP is a division of English Language Teaching (ELT), the only other member of which is English for General Purposes (EGP) (Strevens, 1988; Master 1997a). Johns & Dudley-Evans (1991) provide a broad definition of ESP as “the careful research and design of pedagogical materials and activities for an identifiable group of adult learners within a specific learning context” (p. 298) whose principal distinguishing characteristics are needs assessment and discourse analysis, though Brown (1995) maintains that discourse analysis is a requirement for determining the needs of any language education enterprise. Discourse Analysis is a field unto itself, comprising an important discipline within the field of Linguistics. In terms of ESP, where it seeks to weigh the importance of various elements in the genuine language situations English language learners will encounter, discourse analysis is concerned with microlinguistic elements such as frequency counts (i.e., tense/aspect, mood, information structure, and other text linguistic devices) as well as macrolinguistic concerns such as genre, levels of discourse in rhetorical subsections of texts (e.g., Swales’s notion of “moves” or steps that “make a paper coherent to genre-experienced readers,” 1990, p. 190), and learner interactions with discourse within specific disciplines.

English for Specific Purposes also comprises the largest representative of an international movement known as Languages for Specific Purposes (LSP). The current concerns of the LSP movement are exemplified by a recent call for papers for an international conference on the subject. The topics of the 6th International Conference on Languages for Specific Purposes (http://www.upc.es/eupvg/cilfe6/index.htm,9-26-02), held in Spain in early 2003 and entitled “The Role of Information Technology in LSP Research and Pedagogy," included the use of networks (especially the Internet) and multimedia in LSP teaching; E-learning applications and experiences; information technology in educational research; interaction in virtual learning environments; information technology and materials development; information technology and learner autonomy; lexicology, lexicography, and terminology; translation; and discourse and genre studies (corpus-based studies). The primary difference between LSP and ESP is the former’s inclusion of translation, which ESP is obviously not concerned with.

Research in ESP thus occurs within the overlapping domains of English language education for specific purposes and discourse/genre analysis.

# DEVELOPMENTS, TRENDS, AND TRADITIONS

In an analysis of research trends in four western Applied Linguistics (AL) journals between 1985 and 1997, Gao, Li & Lü (2001) found that there has been a general shift in AL to qualitative methods such that “qualitative research has gained essentially an equal footing with quantitative research as a major research paradigm” (p. 10). In the TESOL Quarterly, one of the four journals Gao, et al. analyzed, the qualitative research over the 12-year period consisted of ethnography $( 3 2 \% )$ , verbal reports $( 2 5 \% )$ , text analysis $( 2 2 \% )$ , narrative accounts $( 1 7 \% )$ , and classroom interaction analysis $( 3 \% )$ . In the other three journals (Applied Linguistics, The Modern Language Journal, and International Review of Applied Linguistics), text analysis was the dominant subtype.

Gao et al.’s (2001) data provide a useful comparison for research in ESP. Hewings (2002) provides an overview of ESP research as reflected in English for Specific Purposes, published by Elsevier. Table 1 shows the topics of published papers over the $^ { 2 0 + }$ year history of the journal. It is clear from Table 1 that text/discourse analysis has dominated the pages of the journal since its inception and continues to increase into the present decade. Program descriptions, on the other hand, sharply diminished after 1986, primarily because submissions in this category were too often descriptions of local programs without sufficient generalizability to other ESP contexts in the world. (When I was a co-editor of the journal between 1995 and

Table 1. Topics of Papers (Hewings 2002)

2002, the most common rejection letter I wrote concerned the lack of universal application of the description of a local program). Needs analysis and syllabus design also decreased in the 1990s after it had been made clear early in the decade that the views of the students (clients or subjects) being taught ESP comprised an essential element of the needs analysis. Materials and methods, on the other hand, continue to be developed in response to specific needs analyses.

Hewings (2002) also shows the ESP subarea represented by articles published in English for Specific Purposes, which apply to some degree to ESP research as a whole. Over the 20-year history of the journal, English for Science and Technology (EST) and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) have dominated and continue to dominate, while articles concerned with General ESP have fallen from $20 \%$ in the early years of the journal to less than $5 \%$ in recent years. English for Occupational/Professional Purposes (EOP/EPP) continues to hover around $10 \%$ . Hewings notes that, although the interest in Business English has dramatically increased in the last decade (accounting for almost $20 \%$ of what foreign students study in the US, cf. Open Doors, 2002), the Business English research base is still in its infancy and will remain underrepresented in the pages of the journal until it is taught in universities.

Hewings also provides a closer analysis of the text/discourse analysis category, including mode of communication and concern with professional vs. student products. Mode of communication refers to whether the data analyzed were written or spoken. Between 1997 and 2001, analyses of written text comprised $8 6 \%$ of this category, the remaining $1 4 \%$ spoken. In the early 1980s, the ratio was $73 \%$ written to $2 7 \%$ spoken, the spoken variety decreasing steadily ever since. Hewings believes this may be partially due to the fact that written text is easier to analyze, even though it is clearly more important for the ultimate user of ESP to be able to speak than to write. It is also partially due to the increasing importance of genre analysis to the field, which tends to focus on written rather than spoken genres. Similarly, there has been a much greater concern with professional products (most recently $7 5 \%$ professional, $1 5 \%$ student, and $10 \%$ interaction between professional and student in generating a product), though analyses of interactions have increased slightly over the years. Hewings believes this is a natural state of affairs since professional product data has a far wider application in ESP than does data gained from student products or their interactions with professionals in producing them.

One of the strengths of research in ESP is its international character. Hewings shows that there has been a steady increase in the number of international authors published in English for Specific Purposes with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of authors from the UK and the US. In the period from 1997 to 2001, international authors accounted for $6 9 \%$ of the articles, with $1 9 \%$ for the US and $12 \%$ for the UK, whereas in the early 1980s, the ratio was 39%US, $2 5 \%$ UK, and $3 6 \%$ other countries. Hewings believes this is a testament to the growing acceptance of ESP around the world and, consequently, its validity as a subject for research. It also reflects the fact that ESP is generally more likely to be carried out in non-English-speaking countries than in English-speaking ones and that ESP goes under different guises in the US, such as content-based instruction (CBI) or Workplace ESL (Master 1997b). Hewings shows that the 1990s were marked by a substantial increase in papers from two regions of the world outside the US and the UK: Central and South America, and China and Hong Kong.

The gender of authors in English for Specific Purposes is also of interest. In the last decade, female authors have been slightly better represented than males, most recently $5 5 \%$ female and $45 \%$ male, the percentage of females rising from a low of $4 2 \%$ at the beginning of the 1980s. Hewings notes, however, that the authors cited in English for Specific Purposes articles are overwhelmingly male.

Hewings concludes his overview of English for Specific Purposes by speculating on what the future holds for the field of ESP. He believes that while increasing specificity is a primary characteristic of ESP research today, the field will have to become more concerned with English as an International Language. “The growing use of English as the means of communication in interaction between non-native English speakers seems likely to have a major impact on the kinds of ESP programmes we provide and the type of research needed to underpin those programmes” (Hewings, 2002, unpaginated).

Similarly, Dudley-Evans & St. John (1997) believe that cross-cultural issues will be increasingly important research issues, especially “what language is culturally appropriate in different situations” (p. 232). They also think that critical approaches to research will affect the development of ESP as they question the norms of ESP teaching.

With regard specifically to English for Academic Purposes (EAP), Jordan (1997) states that future research will undoubtedly focus on genre analysis at different levels, computerassisted language learning (CALL), disciplinary cultures (i.e., the “insider” culture of specific discourse communities), learner independence, and collaboration between EAP teachers and subject specialists (pp. 279-280). These categories are also of interest to ESP, and topics such as genre analysis, CALL, and learner independence are concerns of the entire ELT teaching profession.

# CURRENT RESEARCH

The primary focus of current ESP research is specificity, i.e., detailed explications of the nature of the language used or required to communicate in specific academic and occupational settings, usually accompanied by specific pedagogical applications for nonnative speakers of English. Current research in ESP as reflected in English for Specific Purposes continues to be

concerned with specificity in three broad areas of focus: 1) macro-linguistic concerns such as writing, authenticity, and oral communication, 2) micro-linguistic elements such as vocabulary and grammatical categories, and 3) descriptions of various types of ESP programs. In the articles published in the last three volumes of the journal (2000, 2001, and 2002), as shown in Table 2, $60 \%$ had a macrolinguistic focus, $2 1 \%$ had a microlinguistic focus, and $1 9 \%$ dealt with program descriptions. The categories of ESP that these articles concerned are described in Table 3.

Table 3 shows that articles concerning academic, science/technology, and business topics continue to dominate the journal, accounting for two-thirds $( 6 9 \% )$ of the articles published. It should be noted that English for occupational/professional purposes includes six BE articles and one on a new area of focus in EOP: English for textile and clothing merchandisers.

The topics and the results of these studies are summarized by category in the next section. They provide a detailed view of the research focus in ESP over the last three years.

# English for Academic Purposes (EAP)

The macrolinguistic concerns in EAP included academic assessment, authenticity, data gathering, negotiating in the classroom, writing, and use of the Internet. $\diamond$ Macdonald, Badger & White (2000) questioned the validity of authentic materials in EAP classes, finding relevant texts less motivating than interaction with a speaker, and EAP instructors’ live simulations of lectures more effective than taped authentic lectures. ◊ Okamura & Shaw (2000) analyzed letters accompanying papers submitted for publication and found that academics, both nativeEnglish speakers (NES) and nonnative English speakers (NNES), used appropriate rhetoric and language, but that undergraduate students and overseas English teachers used inappropriate rhetoric and language, suggesting that the status of the learner must be considered in the teaching of writing. $\diamond$ Braine (2001) reported on the difficulties encountered in acquiring data on undergraduate writing tasks in Hong Kong, apparently because of the sources’ uncertainty about their levels of English proficiency. $\diamond$ Feak & Salehzadeh (2001) described a video listening placement assessment for EAP courses at the University of Michigan. ◊ Gao, Li & Lü (2001) compared recent trends in research methods in applied linguistics in China and the West, as described earlier. $\diamond$ Hyon (2001) found that genre-based instruction was remembered to some extent over time but noted that certain approaches to genre may not aid students’ understanding of genre variation and complexity. $\diamond$ Mavor & Trayner (2001) designed a genrealigned framework for teaching EAP courses in a Portuguese university. ◊ Vasileva (2001) examined English and Bulgarian linguistics research articles and found that they were similar in the quantity of hedging and boosting but different in the distribution of hedges and the degree of deference to the discourse community. $\diamond$ Basturkmen (2002) focused on the negotiation of meaning in the language of interaction in college classrooms. ◊ Paltridge (2002) suggested broadening the range of thesis/dissertation types analyzed in teaching EAP students to generate the genre. $\diamond$ Slaouti (2002) argued for the inclusion of critical awareness regarding authority and academic status in teaching college students to use the World Wide Web.

The microlinguistic concerns in EAP included academic use of lexicogrammatical items and agency. $\diamond$ Green, Christopher & Mei (2000) analyzed a corpus of academic texts written by Chinese speakers for the use of topic-fronted devices and sentence –initial logical connectors and found an overproduction of marked themes, leading to an overly emphatic tone. $\diamond$ Lindemann & Mauranen (2001) analyzed the roles of just in spoken academic discourse and found that the mitigating sense of the word involved a phonologically reduced version whereas the sense of “exactly” tended to use a full vowel and be stressed, supporting the need for phonetic detail in EAP. $\diamond$ Moore (2002) researched the frequency and type of agentive elements (Halliday 1994) in sociology, physics, and economics textbooks and found economics to be closer to physics than sociology (even though economics is considered a social science), perhaps to give it scientific credibility.

The academic courses focused on architecture, reading, and the use of textbooks. $\diamond$ Spector-Cohen, Kirschner & Wexler (2001) developed an EAP reading program at the University of Tel Aviv in Israel. $\diamond$ Swales, Barks, Ostermann & Simpson (2001) described an EAP course for Master’s of Architecture students at the University of Michigan. $\diamond$ Yakhontova (2001) discussed the use of a US-based EAP textbook in a Ukrainian university course.

English for Science and Technology (EST)

The macrolinguistic concerns in EST included scientific/technical reading, writing, and use of transparencies. $\diamond$ Chimbganda (2000) reported that first year Bachelor of Science

students who used risk-taking strategies such as restructuring discourse to clarify the intended meaning wrote better than those who used other strategies. $\diamond$ Diaz-Santos (2000) described the advantages of reading “technothrillers” such as Jurassic Park in EST classes as a basis for orienting students to the concerns of the scientific discourse community. $\diamond$ Halimah (2001) compared the Arabic and English scientific writing of 100 Arabic-speaking students, and found that the mechanics were acceptable but not the rhetorical style, which he attributed to the lack of focus on such matters in the classroom. $\diamond$ Ward (2001) found evidence that Thai engineering students evaded reading English language textbooks by concentrating only on the applications, especially the examples (so that they could pass examinations), while ignoring the background knowledge of physical systems that is essential for an engineer. $\diamond$ Lahuerta (2002) found rhetorical organization to play a significant role in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students’ comprehension of EST text. $\diamond$ Rowley-Jolivet (2002) noted the importance of slides and transparencies in structuring the discourse at international scientific conference presentations. $\diamond$ Samraj (2002) analyzed the introductions of research papers in wildlife behavior and conservation biology using Swales’ CARS (create a research space) model, in which she found variation and the need to modify the model.

The microlinguistic concerns in EST included the scientific/technical use of grammar, lexical phrases, and self-reference. $\diamond$ Gledhill (2000) examined the collocations of highfrequency words in introductions to cancer research articles, revealing that semi-preconstructed phrases (e.g., patients who received drug X) abound in scientific writing. $\diamond$ Hyland (2001) investigated the occurrence of self-reference (self-citation and first person pronouns) in 240 research articles in the hard and soft sciences, finding that self-reference occurs at points where the authors “are best able to promote themselves and their individual contributions. Their intrusion helps to strengthen both their credibility and their role in research, and to help them

gain acceptance and credit for their claims” (p. 223). $\diamond$ Martinez (2001) looked at transitivity in the physical, biological, and social sciences, finding that the revelation and concealment of agency allows the author to negotiate the tension between objectivity and personal impact on the scientific community. $\diamond$ Soler (2002) analyzed adjectives in scientific research articles, which are far less frequent than nouns and verbs, and found them to occur most often in the Discussion section, where they play an important role in modulating objectivity, certainty, and evaluation.

The scientific/technical courses focused on teaching in South Africa and Malaysia. $\diamond$ Parkinson (2000) described a theme-based language course for EST students at a South African university. $\diamond$ Ching (2002) reported on an EST writing course at a Malaysian university.

English for Occupational/Professional Purposes (EOP/EPP)

The macrolinguistic concerns in EOP/EPP included professional/occupational authenticity, oral and written communication, and workplace needs. $\diamond$ Brett (2000) questioned the use of authentic materials when students using a CD-ROM based on authentic spoken Business English (BE) lost enthusiasm for self-study on computers and questioned the relevance of the materials. $\diamond$ Gimenez (2000) compared email and formal business letters from the same company and found that the standard business letter format taught in Business English classes would not prepare students to generate appropriate email correspondence. ◊ Li & Mead (2000) focused on the workplace needs of textile and clothing merchandisers for EOP courses at two educational institutions in Hong Kong. $\diamond$ Gimenez (2001) analyzed cross-cultural nonnativespeakers of English engaged in business negotiations, finding that “[t]he way which prices are negotiated appeared to be more related to the status-bound behaviour of the negotiator than to culture” (p. 183). $\diamond$ Henry & Roseberry (2001) analyzed a computerized corpus of 40 job

application letters at the level of strategy rather than move or genre register and found a range of discourse and syntactic features that were not described in textbooks on the genre. $\diamond$ Upton & Connor (2001) used a hand-tagged computerized learner corpus analysis to determine the politeness-strategy “moves” in professional job application letters in three cultures (US, Belgian, and Finnish), finding that the US writers were more formulaic, the Belgians more individualistic, and the Finns exhibited both traits to lesser degrees. The study supports the need for computer investigations that go beyond lexico-grammatical patterning. $\diamond$ Louhiala-Salminen (2002) shadowed a Finnish international corporation manager, revealing the interplay between speaking and writing and how English functioned as the medium of communication in a multinational environment. $\diamond$ Pinto dos Santos (2002) analyzed the rhetorical moves in business letters of negotiation.

The single microlinguistic concern in EOP/EPP was the use of occupational/professional metaphors. $\diamond$ Charteris-Black & Ennis (2001) studied linguistic and conceptual metaphors in financial reports in Chilean and British newspapers, finding the former to prefer psychological health metaphors and the latter nautical metaphors.

# English for Business and Economics (EBE)

The macrolinguistic concerns in EBE included business authenticity, metaphoric awareness, student socialization into the field, and written and spoken communication. $\diamond$ Boers (2000) found that enhanced metaphoric awareness in reading economics texts helped students to remember figurative expressions to recognize their inference patterns. $\diamond$ Charteris-Black (2000) made a case for basing ESP vocabulary teaching for economics students on words that reflect the underlying metaphors of economics, with animate metaphors (e.g., growth) to describe the economy and inanimate ones (e.g., slide) to describe movements of the market.

$\diamond$ Hemais (2001) found that marketing journals depend to a greater extent on insights from practice than they do from research. $\diamond$ Northcott (2001) was concerned with the socialization of international students into a business program at the University of Edinburgh. $\diamond$ Crosling & Ward (2002) questioned the focus on formal business presentations in university business classes when the primary need in the business world is for communication in informal contexts.

The single microlinguistic concern in EBE was the business use of anticipatory it. $\diamond$ Hewings & Hewings (2002) used computerized corpora to analyze anticipatory it in published business research articles and L2 student business dissertations and found the latter not to sufficiently modulate their knowledge claims.

The business courses focused on teaching in Botswana and Hong Kong. $\diamond$ De Beaugrande (2000) reported on a pilot project to teach business at the University of Botswana. $\diamond$ Jackson (2002) compared the use of case studies in two business courses at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

# English for Medical Purposes (EMP)

The single macrolinguistic concern in EMP was medical communication. $\diamond$ Frank (2000) studied the language and communication problems between international students and university student health center staff members, which they found to derive primarily from medical vocabulary and from pragmatic difficulties arising from differing cultural and procedural expectations and affective notions such as prejudice, manner of speaking, and the value of patience and kindness.

The microlinguistic concerns in EMP included medical collocational frameworks and communication. $\diamond$ Marco (2000) studied collocational frameworks such as the  of, a  of, and be  to in medical research papers and found the collocates that fill these slots to be genre-dependent. ◊ Ferguson (2001) examined if-conditionals in medical discourse and found that in spoken consultations they allow politeness and sensitivity, whereas in research articles they provide operational definitions. $\diamond$ Ibrahim (2001) analyzed the questions that doctors in the Arabian Gulf countries use in consultations and argued for consideration of the cultural underpinnings of doctor-centeredness.

The medical courses focused on teaching in Cuba, Hong Kong, and the US. $\diamond$ Maclean, Betancourt & Hunter (2000) described the 15-year evolution of an EMP program in Cuba. ◊ Shi, Corcos & Storey (2001) used videotapes of clinical training sessions to help medical students acquire oral communication skills in an EMP course at the University of Hong Kong. $\diamond$ Bosher & Smalkoski (2002) described an EMP oral communication course at the College of St. Catharine in Minnesota.

English for Academic Legal Purposes (EALP)

The macrolinguistic concerns in EALP included legal writing and the use of computermediated materials. $\diamond$ Feak, Reinhart & Sinsheimer (2000) argued that EALP (English for Academic Legal Purposes) students should learn to write legal research papers (“notes”) rather than primary research reports as preparation for working in legal contexts. $\diamond$ Candlin, Bhatia & Jensen (2002) justified the need for a computer-mediated resource bank of language and discourse-based materials for teaching English for Academic Legal Purposes (EALP) since they found the 37 EALP books currently available to be too context-specific and of little use outside that context.

There was no microlinguistic focus in the EALP articles, and the single legal course focused on teaching in Hong Kong. $\diamond$ Bruce (2002) reported on an EAP course for first-year law students at Hong Kong University.

This survey of articles makes it clear that specificity is the primary focus of ESP research, manifesting in a variety of macro- and microlinguistic concerns in the six major areas of ESP. Other areas of ESP, such as English for the Arts/ Art and Design, English for Sociocultural Purposes, and Vocational ESL (Master 2000) have seldom been represented in the journal, but it is hoped that research in these areas will appear in the future.

# CURRENT CONTROVERSIES

Current controversies in the field of ESP include the extent of subject knowledge the ESP practitioner needs to have, the value of genre-based instruction, and the charge that EAP is “accommodationist.” A major concern, though one that has not yet been labeled a controversy as such, is the efficacy of ESP itself.

# Subject-Matter Knowledge

The question of how much subject-matter expertise the ESP practitioner must have has been a controversy since the early days of ESP. Schachter (1981), representing one extreme of a continuum of views on this matter, believed that EST teachers were primarily ESL teachers making good use of content-specific materials in order to impart communicative competence in English. As a result, she saw teacher knowledge of content as a potential obstruction to the teacher’s true role and even recommended that EST instructors stop teaching a particular area of science or technology after a certain time because they would be unable to resist the temptation to teach content. The other extreme is an entirely content-based curriculum in which linguistic knowledge is subordinated to subject content instruction. Mackay (1981), for example, noted that “some major ESP projects prefer to hire teachers of science who also happen to have some ELT [English Language Teaching] experience or training.”

The issue was aired in two articles in the “Issues in ESP” column in TESOL Matters.

Taylor (1994) argued that “given a solid base of ELT experience, the critical factors for the ESP teacher are attitude and interest, not content knowledge” (p. 14). She believed that “ultimately, helping students express themselves in a content area is easier for an outsider than for a content expert, who usually takes linguistic and content knowledge for granted and has difficulty seeing his or her discipline from the non-English-speaking student’s point of view” (p. 14). Troike (1994), on the other hand, maintained “It is far easier, and more efficient, to train subject-matter specialists in the basics of ESL than to try to train ESL teachers in the technical content of the ESP subject” and “if we try, or even pretend, to teach ESP without knowing the subject matter, we are seriously fooling ourselves or shortchanging our students, or both” (p. 7).

In my view, the degree of expertise of the ESP practitioner depends on the nature of the ESP being taught. In most academic and occupational settings, I side with Taylor’s belief that the ESP instructor is usually better prepared to deal with the real needs of the ESP student than a content instructor. However, in highly technical contexts, such as air traffic control or CAT scan technology, a trained subject-matter specialist is essential, especially when human lives are at stake. Team teaching (Johns & Dudley-Evans, 1980), i.e., the presence of both a content and a language instructor in the classroom, is an effective way to resolve the issue, but it is generally too expensive a solution and not widely practiced, though a successful example is described in Master (2000).

# The Value Of Genre-Based Instruction

Since the publication of John Swales’s Genre Analysis in 1990, considerable attention has been devoted to the notion of genre in the field of ESP. The issue concerns not the value of genre as a construct but whether or not genre specifications should be explicitly taught. The

American New Rhetoric position is that they should not. With its detailed ethnographic descriptions of genres in science, medicine and business, this school focuses on genre as social action (cf. Miller, 1984) and “provide[s] the field of ESL with rich perspectives on what actions genres perform in various communities and how these groups come to value certain text types” (Hyon, 1996, p. 713). It is the understanding of these social contexts that is important, and not the specifications of the genre. “[W]hat has to be attended to...are features of the situation....Knowing the gross surface features is the easy part, and insufficient on its own” (Freedman & Medway, 1994, pp. 11-12, cited in Hyon, 1996, p. 699). Teaching applications are therefore not emphasized, though some New Rhetoricians are beginning to work out means of applying their theories in the classroom, e.g., by having university students specify the purpose, audience, and circumstances of writing a text at the top of an assignment and then assessing how well the writing responds to this context (Coe, 1994, cited in Hyon 1996).

The Australian school of systemic functional linguistics, on the other hand, believes that genre specifications should be explicitly taught. Based on Halliday’s (1978) notion that language form is shaped by social context (i.e., the activity going on, the relationships among participants, and the channel of communication), Martin, Christie, & Rothery (1987, cited in Hyon, 1996) describe genres as structural forms used by cultures for various purposes in certain contexts. The Australian school was concerned that immigrant primary and secondary students (and now adult migrants in the workforce) were not being given the school genres required for social success.

The two schools of thought are aimed at different populations. The New Rhetoricians are concerned with helping university students and professionals to function in sophisticated academic and professional milieus, whereas the Australian school aims to foster the survival of immigrant children and adult migrants in the school and the workplace. ESP practitioners have tended to apply the Australian notion of genre to all non-English-speaking students, including those in academic and professional contexts, leading to accusations in some quarters that the teaching of genre specifications stifles creativity, and raising the issue of whether genre teaching is ultimately a scaffold or a straitjacket.

# Accommodation in EAP

Critical theory is concerned with “questioning the status quo to probe beyond conventional explanations of why things are the way they are” (Benesch, 2001, p. 64). Inspired by Freire (1998) and Foucault (1988), critical EAP encourages students to “assess their options in particular situations rather than assuming they must fulfill expectations” (p. 64). In this light, the longstanding effort of EAP practitioners to aid their students by helping them to learn the requirements of the disciplines and develop their academic communicative competence (Swales 1990) has been called accommodationist (Benesch, 1993) and assimilationist (Pennycook, 1994) by critical EAP theorists. Alison (1994) challenged these theorists, calling them ideologist and imperialistic in their effort to dominate other viewpoints and arguing that EAP pragmatism did not presume an unexamined status quo. Ultimately, the EAP pragmatists agreed that criticism could be constructive (Alison, 1996), while the critical theorists acknowledged the struggles EAP practitioners have had in trying to develop better programs for academic nonnative speakers (Benesch, 2001).

In my view, all educational enterprises, though especially those within the English teaching profession (including not just EAP but the entire field of ESP), need to constantly and rigorously question themselves. Not to do so is to run the risk that, while benignly helping students to acquire access to better job opportunities and greater academic success, ESP practitioners are unwittingly promoting the interests of those already in power (Master, 1998).

Widdowson (1980) warned of the danger of providing a servant with just enough language ability to serve a master, describing it as “the curse of Caliban.” Critical EAP theorists have reminded the field of ESP that education is a political act no matter how innocently pragmatic we claim to be. For this reason, language teachers have to “remain vigilant in regard to all voices, including their own” (Fiumara 1990, paraphrased in Master, 1998, p. 724).

# The Efficacy of ESP

When statistical analysis appeared in the 57 published articles summarized in the previous section, it was invariably of the descriptive variety, i.e., “a set of concepts and methods used in organizing, summarizing, tabulating, depicting, and describing collections of data” (Shavelson, 1981, p. 9). More than half of the articles used simple descriptive statistics such as percentages, means, and in one case standard deviations; two reported chi square values; and two reported correlation coefficients.

The category of research that appears to be missing in ESP research is quantitative studies, i.e., experimental or quasi-experimental designs supported by inferential statistics. The most obvious topic that such research might be applied to is the efficacy of ESP itself. Calls for such research have been made for over 30 years. Mackay (1981), for example, noted that "the euphoria of the innovative phase in ESP programs has died down" (p. 108), leaving the field open to several questions of accountability:

1. Do these ESP/EST programs work?   
2. Are they more effective than previous programs aimed at general language   
proficiency?   
3. If so, in what ways are they more effective?   
4. Are there any ways in which they are less effective?

5. Can the expense be justified?

6. Should we spend money on continuous quality control of ESP courses?   
7. Is there any evidence that syllabus planners are performing at least as well now, in terms of serving their clients' needs, as they were prior to the ESP epoch?   
8. Are there any unintended or unforeseen outcomes resulting from the use of any given ESP program? (cited in Master, 2000).

Johns and Dudley-Evans (1991) found that, even though the case for ESP had been accepted internationally, “few empirical studies have been conducted to test the effectiveness of ESP courses” (p. 303). They described the principal areas of concern in ESP to be how specific ESP courses should be, whether they should focus on a particular skill or integrate them all, and whether an appropriate ESP methodology could be developed. They noted that EAP was still dominant internationally, but that as ESP moved from its traditional EAP base, there would be “an increasing need for research into the nature of discourse, written or spoken, that must be produced or understood by those enrolled in ESP courses” (p. 307).

One of the few attempts to seriously address the efficacy of ESP instruction was the Reading in EST (REST) Project (under the auspices of UCLA) at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico (Hudson, 1991; Lynch, 1992; Lynch 1996). Lynch (1992) found that a group of thirdyear chemical engineering students (Pretest $\mathsf { n } = 1 1 1$ ; Posttest $\mathsf { n } = 1 0 3 \cdot$ ) who received an EST reading curriculum that focused on previewing, sampling, comprehending, and analyzing the rhetorical and grammatical structure of “authentic chemical engineering texts that were being used in the students’ other courses” (p. 65) over a four-month period made statistically significant improvement ${ \bf \langle p = . 0 0 0 \rangle }$ on an English language test (the UCLA English as a Second Language Placement Examination, or ESLPE, whose reliabili ty value for the Kuder-Richardson 21 formula $[ \mathsf { K R } _ { 2 1 }$ )ranged between .71 and .81 for the four administrations) compared to a control group (Pretest $n = 6 1$ ; Posttest $\mathsf { n } = 5 4$ ) of pharmacobiology students at the same university who received “no English instruction whatsoever, not even traditional EFL classes” (p. 90). In the editors’ postscript to Lynch (1992), Alderson & Beretta (1992) described the study as “one of the first thorough attempts to evaluate an EST programme in a university setting” (p. 96). Unfortunately, as the author himself notes, the absence of a treatment for an equivalent control group “reduce[s] the question of treatment effect to ‘is the REST curriculum better than nothing?’” (p. 90) and thus allows no empirical proof of the efficacy of ESP to be drawn.

In another promising study based on the same program, Hudson (1991) investigated the effect of EST content (reading) comprehension on general language acquisition. The content, also drawn from the field of chemical engineering, was based on journal articles concerned with such themes as materials and properties, electronics, and physical and mechanical processes. Using a test that examined reading grammar, reading comprehension, and general reading ability (with $K \mathsf { R } _ { 2 0 }$ reliability coefficients ranging from .84 to .90 for the three forms of the test), Hudson found significant improvement in all three areas after the experimental group $( \mathsf { n } = 1 5 2 )$ had received two years of academic instruction compared to a control group ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 2 1 2$ ) that had received no instruction (labeled “uninstructed” in Tables 1 and 2, pp. 93-4). The absence of a treated control group means that this study also provides no evidence of the efficacy of ESP, nor of content-based instruction (CBI), though it had the potential to do both.

Brown (1996) used an EST program (also conducted under the auspices of UCLA) begun in 1980 at the Guangzhou English Language Center (GELC) at Zhongshan University in Guangdong Province in the People’s Republic of China as one of two examples (the other is the University of Hawai’i) of a systematic approach to program development. In the chapter on program evaluation at GELC, he stated, “It turned out, in general terms, that students who learn English for science and technology appear to gain systematically in their overall proficiency as measured by tests like the TOEFL” (p. 240). On further examination, I was not able to ascertain any additional information supporting this conclusion.

Kasper (2000) provided indirect evidence for the improved performance of high intermediate to advanced EAP students who were given sustained content-based instruction using the Internet as a resource in either business or environmental science compared to the rest of the ESL program at the same level (who presumably did not receive sustained content based instruction). Based on reading and writing examinations, $7 3 . 3 \%$ of the treatment group were able to skip a level (i.e., from ESL 91 to ESL 93, bypassing ESL 92) and move to ESL 93, a course for both native and nonnative speakers, whereas only $2 1 . 4 \%$ of the students at this level “in the program overall” (p. 67) were able to do this (chi-squared $= 2 8 . 4 7$ ; $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ ). Unfortunately, since the study was not designed as an experiment, the data are entirely post hoc. No pretest score was reported to provide an assessment of the level of the students prior to the treatment, and the number of subjects is not indicated. The testing instrument is not described, statistically or otherwise, nor are the criteria for skipping a level. Finally, it appears that the treatment group was included as part of the control group in the comparison. These factors remove the possibility of empirical results.

Despite these potentially promising leads, empirical proof of the efficacy of ESP thus remains elusive. Echoing the need for research into ESP, Duff (2001) cites Jordan (1997) and Zamel & Spack (1998) in maintaining that “insufficient research has examined language learning, discourse socialization, and assessment at more advanced levels of secondary and postsecondary education for various academic or occupational purposes” (p. 606). She provides four major research questions to address what she finds to be lacking. Those that best reflect the issue of the efficacy of ESP are (p. 607):

• What kinds of preparation, intervention, and assessment are most effective in assisting ESL learners in these [i.e., ESP] settings to attain their own goals as well as reach established external standards?

• What factors contribute to underachievement or attrition among particular ethnolinguistic groups of L2 students in academic/occupational programs, and what interventions might improve completion rates and other desired outcomes for these groups?

• What is the impact of ESL program completion on participants’ language abilities and identities within their academic and professional communities?

Dudley-Evans (2001), in his farewell editorial, notes how focused and specific ESP work has become.

The specificity I have noted is not necessarily of a subject-specific nature; it is rather that, as ESP research becomes more sophisticated and the range of its activity much broader, it has inevitably developed a much more focussed approach that looks at more detailed questions” (p. 311). “[A]lready in 10(1) [1991] the trend in English for Specific Purposes towards articles presenting analysis rather than pedagogical issues and syllabus design was apparent. ...While not in any way rejecting the need for theory and analysis in ESP, I do feel that we are reaching a stage where we need to consider how effective the courses that are developed from this research are. Are we really delivering in the ESP classroom? Are students in ESP classes more motivated than those in General English classes? I look forward to reading some more papers on these topics in future issues” (p. 312).

In short, despite 30 years of calls for empirical research demonstrating the efficacy of ESP, not a single published study has appeared to this end. All we really have is what Bowyers (1980, cited in Johns and Dudley-Evans, 1991) called “war stories and romances.”

# CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

ESP has enjoyed more than a 30 year history of acceptance based on anecdotal successes and the obvious motivational inspiration it provides for English language learners, not only in academic and occupational settings but also in sociocultural contexts such as literacy and citizenship programs, prisons, and AIDS programs (Master 1997b). It needs to heed the repeated calls to establish its empirical validity as a viable means of second language acquisition. There is also a dire need for research in the occupational and sociocultural aspects of ESP as well as the training of ESP practitioners.

The field will no doubt continue to provide detailed descriptions of specific instantiations of ESP like those that have characterized the last three years of English for Specific Purposes. In this regard, Hewings (2002) believes that China and Hong Kong will continue to be substantial contributors to the journal in the coming years, along with Eastern Europe and Spain, where ESP is becoming of particular interest at the university level.

It is hoped, too, that the field will begin to see the publication of experimental studies based on inferential statistics. While it is difficult to measure the effects of syllabi and methodologies, one can imagine controlled studies in which NNS are taught skills using fieldspecific material and comparing their performance to a similar group using non-field-specific material. For example, NNS science majors could be taught reading skills based on journals in their fields (like the REST study) while a control group of NNS science students is taught reading skills using English literature or material from some other field such as psychology; their

performance on a common reading test could then be measured and compared. An EOP example might be teaching a group of NNS manufacturing employees a VESL/EOP class based on a careful needs analysis of their on-the-job language requirements while a similar group receives general instruction in survival English, and comparing their performance on a number of measures, such as a language test, a criterion-referenced skills test, or an objective measure such as number of reported “rejects” (i.e., flawed products that must be discarded) by each group on the manufacturing line over a given period of time.

At the same time, it is hoped that the field will continue to remain keenly aware of the power of the double-edged sword ESP practitioners wield in representing the most powerful nations on the planet while addressing the increasing demand for instruction in English as the lingua franca of the learning and working world.
