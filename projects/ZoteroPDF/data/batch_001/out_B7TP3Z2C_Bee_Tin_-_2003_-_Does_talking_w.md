# Abstract

The use of group work and group discussion tasks is widespread in Higher Education, the underlying assumption being that group talk helps learning. Many studies have identified features of effective talk for learning, but a belief in the importance of talking for learning is itself questionable and culture-specific. As Stubbs [(1976) Language, schools and classrooms (p. 104) London: Methuen says: ‘‘this equation of learning with talking is widely held in our society, but is by no means universal.’’ In this article, I will examine the extent to which talking helps learning in convergent group discussion tasks, where the students’ goal is to construct pre-determined ‘‘true justified knowledge’’. The article will analyse instances where the same group of Malaysian students, studying on a Higher Education programme in the UK, both succeeded and failed to arrive at the truth. Although the analysis confirms the value of exploratory talk in the construction of valuable knowledge, we need to consider what causes students to engage in exploratory talk. In convergent tasks exploratory talk may not be triggered unless the expert knowledge required to solve the problem is already at the students’ potential or developmental level. Recommendations are made for the use of group discussion tasks in pedagogy and EAP classes.

# 1. Defining convergent tasks as opposed to divergent tasks

Depending on the nature of the goal or outcome that students are required to obtain, group discussion tasks can be divided into two types: convergent tasks and divergent tasks (e.g. see Duff, 1986). In closed convergent tasks, only one outcome is expected or is true; and the interactants need to converge towards a single goal. For example, two plus two is four and can never be five. Only one single answer or outcome is true. In open divergent tasks, more than one outcome is possible, and the interactants may often end up maintaining their own opinion, even after listening to those of the other participants (Pica, Kanagy, & Falodun, 1993). For example, debates and opinion-exchange tasks belong to that category. Depending on the argument put forward, there are many possibilities and view-points that can be accepted. While novelty, originality and creativity are important features of valuable ideas and knowledge (outcome) required in divergent tasks, justification and truth/accuracy are important features of valuable knowledge required in convergent tasks [see Tan (forthcoming) for detailed discussion of what counts as valuable knowledge in convergent tasks and divergent tasks].

# 2. The role of talk in learning

Group work and group discussion tasks are commonly practised in many higher education programmes. An assumption underlying this practice is that group interaction and talk has a role in engaging students in the process of constructing knowledge and learning. This assumption is also supported by the Vygotskian view of interaction and learning.

In the Vygotskian (1978) view of learning, group work or group interaction can create opportunities for learning. ‘Cognitive processes are the result of social and cultural interactions’ (Vygotsky, 1978, cited in Lunt, 1993, p. 156) and ‘interaction is good only when it proceeds ahead of development’ (Vygotsky, 1956, cited in Wertsch and Stone, 1985, p. 165). A good characteristic of learning, according to Vygotsky, is that ‘it creates the zone of proximal development’ (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 90), i.e. an opportunity for learners to extend their actual developmental level, and to discover their potential developmental level.

The ZPD is defined as ‘the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers’ (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86). This definition of ZPD indicates the importance of guidance from ‘more capable peers’ or ‘adult/expert guidance’. Moreover, for learning to take place, the interaction needs to take place in the ZPD. The goal or the outcome that a task requires learners to obtain should be in their potential developmental level and learners need to collaborate with more capable peers or experts to achieve this goal. Vygotsky’s definition of ZPD indicates that just interacting or talking is not sufficient. The assistance and help from a capable peer (expertise) and the need for the target knowledge to be in the learner’s potential developmental level are important.

# 3. Studies of the features of interaction or talk desirable for learning

Following this Vygotskian view of interaction for learning, many educational studies have been conducted, investigating and identifying the features of talk desirable for learning. These various studies can be divided into two broad categories according to the type of interactions they study.

On one hand, there are studies (e.g. Bliss, Askew, & Macrae, 1996; Jarvis & Robinson, 1997; Wood, Bruner, & Ross 1976) which investigate the nature of interaction between the teacher and students, or between the adult and the child, or between the expert and the novice. Interactants in such studies have unequal relationships in terms of the knowledge they possess (a higher power distance). In such interactions, the teacher, the adult or the expert, generally speaking, possesses the expertise required for the successful completion of the task and helps the novice to complete the task.

A major finding which has arisen from such studies of interactions involving a higher power distance is the characteristic of ‘scaffolding’. Wood et al. (1976) introduced the metaphor of ‘scaffolding’ to depict the nature of the support that an adult provides in helping a child to learn how to perform a task that, alone, the child could not master. Scaffolding refers to ‘‘the steps taken to reduce the degrees of freedom in carrying out some tasks so that the child can concentrate on the difficult skill she is in the process of acquiring’’ (Bruner, 1978, p. 19). Studies within this category have identified some ‘scaffolding’ techniques used by the teacher, a more capable peer, or the expert to help a student, a less capable peer, or a novice to transform what is in the novice’s potential developmental level to his/her actual developmental level.

The other type of interaction commonly practised in pedagogy is the interaction between peers or between students. In such interactions, the role relationship in terms of expertise is not clear-cut or fixed as in the previous type of interaction, and there is a low power distance. Generally speaking, students differ in the knowledge they possess and in the different sources of knowledge they bring to the task, and can thus act as experts at different points in the problem solving task.

Many educational studies have been conducted investigating the nature of such interactions between peers. Among them, the seminal work of Fisher (1993) and Mercer (1995) have identified three types of talk: disputational talk, cumulative talk and exploratory talk. While ‘disputational talk’ is mainly characterised by ‘‘disagreement and individualised decision-making’’ (Mercer, 1995: p. 104) and ‘‘there is little evidence of either partner attempting to build on the other’s ideas’’ (Fisher, 1993, p. 250), in ‘‘cumulative talk’ the speakers ‘pick up and add to previous statements, apparently accepted without challenge’’ (Fisher, 1993, p. 253). ‘Exploratory talk’ is claimed to be a desirable type of talk which ‘‘offers a potential for learning not obvious in the other two types’’ (Fisher, 1993, p. 255), and is described as a kind of talk in which ‘‘the initiation may be challenged and counter-challenged, but with suggestions which are developments of that initiation. Progress then rests on the joint acceptance of one of the suggestions, or of a modification of what has been put forward’’ (Fisher, 1993, p. 255, my emphasis). The features of exploratory talk desirable for learning identified by such studies can be seen as reflecting the requirement of convergent tasks where students are expected to arrive at one single goal through reaction and justification.

# 4. The features of talk desirable for the successful completion of convergent tasks

In convergent tasks, the learners work towards a single correct goal. The ZPD in such tasks is the distance between the incorrect outcome that learners will arrive at when they work alone independently and the correct outcome that they will arrive at when they work collaboratively with more ‘capable’ peers. In such convergent tasks, the discovery of truth is important. The term ‘capable’ refers to the notion of capability in terms of the possession of and ability to discover true knowledge required for the successful completion of the task.

Convergent tasks require students to discover the truth, which is ‘already there’ (i.e. already predetermined truth) through reasoning and justification. The knowledge required by convergent tasks fits in with the traditional Western philosophical epistemology of knowledge as ‘true justified beliefs’ (e.g. see Audi, 1998; Sosa, 1991), which has its origin in science. This knowledge is a kind of scientific knowledge where truth, accuracy, justification and reasoning are important. Whether talking helps learning in such tasks is to be judged in terms of the correctness of knowledge students arrive at through interacting with peers.

When interacting in convergent tasks, there are many possible ways of arriving at the truth. There are cases in convergent tasks where students chance upon correct guesses without real justification. Such ‘lucky guesses’, in terms of philosophy, do not count as knowledge. In philosophy, for a knowledge claim, a belief is required not only to be true but also to be justified. ‘‘A false belief is not knowledge. A belief based on a lucky guess is not knowledge either, even if it is true’’ (Audi, 1998, p. 214). (An example of such lucky guesses can be seen in the extract 1 in the next section.)

This does not, however, mean that justification is always necessary especially when the truthfulness of a given piece of knowledge is apparent and commonly accepted by the group. Hence, there are cases when students arrive at the true, correct answer easily. In such cases, the knowledge required for the task seems to be already in their actual developmental level. It is already given and shared among the group. In such cases, one student’s offer of the correct answer is readily accepted by the group and justification for the choice of the truth is made redundant, as the truth is already transparent to the group. The task is too easy to create an opportunity for learning or to help students to discover what is in their potential developmental level. In other words, the task is oriented at their actual developmental level but not at their potential developmental level.

On the other hand, there are cases where problems are not immediately solved; and the knowledge required to solve those problems does not seem to be in the students’ immediate conscious awareness or in their actual developmental level yet, although it may be in their potential developmental level. The task in such cases is oriented beyond the students’ actual developmental level. In the Vygotskian view, such tasks are important for learning as ‘‘the only ‘‘good learning’’ is that which is in advance of development’’ (Vygotsky, 1978: p. 89). Analysing such cases or episodes can help us understand the role of talk in learning or helping students to discover the true justified knowledge required for the successful completion of convergent tasks.

My discussion on the role of talk in the search for truth in convergent tasks in the next section will focus on two such cases where the target knowledge is not an immediate part of the students’ given and shared knowledge and students engage in the discovery of true target knowledge, both successfully and unsuccessfully, through interacting with one another.

# 5. Does ‘talking’ help learning? The need for expertise, justification and convergence

This section compares two episodes in a convergent task: a successful episode in which students engaged successfully in the process of discovering true justified ideas desirable for the successful completion of the convergent task, and an unsuccessful episode in which the same group of students failed to arrive at the truth.

The two extracts are taken from a convergent task recorded in a module called ‘Grammatical Descriptions’1 for BEd TESOL students at University College Chichester, UK. There were five Malaysian students in the group: Y (male); S (female); Ti (female); Li (female); and A (female). The task had both text input and task questions as its input. The students were provided with a written text with 15 grammatical errors underlined and also with a set of task questions (see Fig. 1). The task questions required them to discuss the underlined errors and write suitable corrections; and to indicate the grammatical area which provides some form of explanation of the correct usage for each mistake. The task (in particular question 1) is convergent as the students are expected to work convergently towards the correct answer for each grammatical error underlined. Although in some cases more than one answer is possible, the number of correct answers for each error is very limited or closed.

The analysis in this section draws upon the analytic framework and the taxonomy of idea framing proposed in an earlier paper (Tan, 2000). In that paper, I proposed a taxonomy of idea framing and identified various conceptual links through which an idea can be generated in association with other ideas.

On the basis of the ‘true-false’ nature of ideas, the paper (Tan, 2000) proposed two major types of idea framing—additive and reactive framing—and their sub-categories. If an idea has a truth-value of being either true or false, once such an idea is uttered, it can be responded to as either being true or false (or relatively false). When two ideas have an additive link, the second idea is an addition to the first idea without judgement, evaluation or comment on the quality, truthfulness, or validity of the propositional content of the first idea. In contrast, when two ideas have a reactive link, the second idea is an addition to the first idea with judgement or evaluation or comment on the quality, truthfulness or validity of the propositional content of the first idea. While in additive framing, the truthfulness of the previous idea is taken for granted and accepted, this is not the case with reactive framing. Under additive framing, there are different idea frames: ‘adding’, ‘explaining’, ‘expanding’, ‘concluding’, ‘diverging’, and ‘converging’. The idea frames under reactive framing are ‘contrasting’, ‘contradicting’, ‘counteracting’, ‘challenging’, and ‘evaluating’ (see Tan (2000, forthcoming) for definitions and features of each category).

As discussed above, convergent tasks require students to work towards a single goal, and accuracy and justification are important. The requirement of one single goal will require students to examine the accuracy, truthfulness and justification of various ideas contributed and finally to converge towards a single correct answer. In other words, the truthfulness of the ideas proposed needs to be ‘challenged’, ‘contradicted’, ‘explained’, and finally the various ideas contributed need to be ‘converged’. Consecutively, ‘contradicting’,2 ‘explaining’3 and ‘converging’4 are thus very important for the successful completion of convergent tasks.

Fig. 1. Grammar correction task.

Following this framework of analysis, I will first examine the extract where the students failed to arrive at the correct solution (Extract 1) and then the extract where they succeeded (Extract 2).

# 5.1. ‘after so long’

In extract 1 in Table 1, the discussion was focused on identifying what was wrong with ‘after so long time’ in the letter students were given on their handout. The true target knowledge required for the students to find out was ‘after such a long time’. In this extract, students failed to discover the true justified knowledge required for the task. They failed to build upon each other’s ideas and contributions, to offer significant justifications for their choices and contributions. Ideas were framed competitively towards divergent goals rather than collaboratively towards a convergent goal.

The extract began with S (246–248) ‘adding’ two possible alternatives: ‘after so long a time or after a long time’, neither of which were the correct choice required. Y (256–257) then ‘added’ another possible alternative: ‘after so long’ (‘I don’t put ‘time’ at all’). S (264) also ‘added’ another alternative ‘after such a long time’. Although it was the correct answer, this seemed to be a ‘lucky guess’ without any justification. As can be seen in the lines that followed, this ‘lucky guess’ was not noticed by S and the rest of the group, and was not mentioned again later in the discussion. Perhaps the structure ‘such a long time’ was in S’s potential developmental level, but there was no more capable peer to help her transform that into her actual developmental level.

We can also see Y constructing his own ideas competitively rather than collaboratively with S. For example, while S was proposing ‘after so long a time’, ‘after a long time’, or ‘after such a long time’, Y’s (268, 274) attempt to continue talking about his choice (What is ‘so long’? What word class?) can be seen as ‘diverging from S’s contributions, rather than building upon her ideas.

Although they attempted to ‘expand’ or ‘explain’ the grammatical alternatives they proposed and made some attempt to react to each other, the ideas generated were insignificant and incorrect and they failed to arrive at the target truth due to the lack of required expertise. For example, Ti’s (354–358) ‘challenge’ of S’s choice (‘after a long time’) as ‘awkward’ was not elaborated further by herself or the group. Y’s (374–376) description of ‘after a long time’ as ‘more posh’ and ‘so long a time’ as ‘more exquisite’ was not a sound justification or a significant idea either. S (378–379) also jumped to the decision that they would, therefore, replace ‘so’ in ‘after so long time’ with ‘a’ (‘after a long time’). It was apparent that none of the students had the expertise; i.e. the grammatical knowledge concerning the structure ‘such a long time required for this particular problem.

There was not much attempt to build upon each other’s ideas and to construct knowledge collaboratively towards a convergent goal. Many competing choices [‘after so long a time’, ‘after a long time’, ‘such a long time’ (S) and ‘after so long (Y)] were proposed, but they failed to explore the specific features of these various grammatical items and the reasons for their choices, and they also failed to find the relationships between these items (e.g. the differences between these various choices).

The type of talk found in this extract where various alternatives were ‘added’ without much criticism or discussion is somewhat similar to what Fisher (1993) and Mercer (1995) call ‘cumulative talk’. ‘‘[I]nitiations are accepted either without discussion

5 In addition to the core categories of additive and reactive framing, there are also other categories (Meta-text, Meta-task, Meta-help) are coded in my analysis. These categories do not carry ideational content required for the task and are more concerned with the management of the task. ‘Meta-text’ refers to instances where specific reference is made to the text input on which the discussion is based as an attempt to find answers. ‘Metatask’ refers to instances which are concerned with managing the flow of the task (e.g. let’s move on to the next one). ‘Meta-help’ refers to instances where students seek external help (e.g. from the teacher).

or with additions or superficial amendments’’ (Fisher, 1993, p. 255). ‘‘Speakers build positively but uncritically on what the other has said’’ (Mercer, 1995, p. 104). This type of talk, as they note, is not very effective for the construction of knowledge. The above extract confirms this view where convergent tasks are concerned.

# 5.2. ‘I enjoy very much’

Unlike the previous extract, extract 2 in Table 2 is an example of the same students successfully arriving at the true justified knowledge required for the task. This extract shows how the group collaboratively constructed knowledge together. It also illustrates the important role of ‘contradicting’, ‘explaining’, and ‘converging’, and the cumulative effect of additive framing in the construction of true justified knowledge.

Table 2. Extract 2 I enjoy very much'   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Iable z. I enjoy very ndcnl META-TEXT S: sometimes I wish to be a student...&#x27;/ : : TI: META-TEXT S[T] S: /`Usually, I enjoy very much but sometimes I wish to be a student once</td></tr></table></body></html>

In this extract, the discussion was on identifying what was wrong with ‘I enjoy very much‘. The target knowledge was ‘I enjoy myself very much’ or ‘I enjoy my work very much’. The students were required to decide what was wrong with the error, how to correct it, and which section of the grammar book to refer to.

The extract began with S (894–895) ‘adding’ a possible alternative ‘I am enjoying myself’ as a correction for ‘I enjoy’. Y (897–898) ‘contradicted’ S (‘it’s not right’) and his repetition of the continuous tense (‘I am having fun’) emphasised the continuous tense, the part where it did not sound right. A (904–905) developed Y’s idea and ‘explained’ why it was wrong by referring to the word ‘usually’ in the text (‘it’s ‘usually’), implying that with the word ‘usually’, the simple present is more suitable. These contradictory ideas led S (907–908) to modify her initial idea ‘I am enjoying myself very much’ to ‘I enjoy myself very much’, ‘converging’ the ideas contributed by herself, Y and A.

Y (911) also justified S’s choice of ‘I enjoy myself’ when he ‘explained’ that ‘‘enjoy’ needs something’. This generated a series of ‘adding’ and repeating. We can see Y, A, and S (911–928) ‘adding’ similar ideas together (‘you enjoy what? ’, ‘enjoy doing’, ‘it needs an object’) and repeating each other’s ideas. The ideas repeated and added finally had the cumulative effect and accumulated into a new significant idea ‘so, we have to look up in the transitive verb’ from Li (930–931). This idea of Li’s can be seen as a generalised idea of all the preceding specific similar ideas, but quite significantly different from them at the same time. This new idea (‘transitive verb/ intransitive verb’) which was inspired by the collective addition of similar ideas (‘enjoy does not stand on its own’, ‘enjoy needs something’, ‘enjoy is a verb that does not stand on it own’, ‘it needs an object’) was evaluated as a significant idea by S (935–936) (‘umm, smart. This is intransitive verb, yeah?’).

This extract shows the important role of ‘converging’ contradictory ideas into a single goal and the cumulative effect of additive framing in the construction of knowledge in convergent tasks. We can also see the students in this extract acting as capable peers pooling their knowledge sources to solve the problem collaboratively. There was an attempt not only to ‘contradict’ given ideas (e.g. Y’s contradicting S’s choice ‘I am enjoying myself’) but also to justify them with ‘explanations’ (e.g. A’s justification of Y’s contradiction) and to modify given ideas by incorporating and ‘converging’ the alternative ideas proposed.

In this extract the same students who failed to find the correct answer in the previous extract successfully arrived at the ‘truth‘ through talk and through the use of both additive and reactive framing. The type of talk in which they engaged in this extract can be called ‘exploratory talk’ (Fisher, 1993; Mercer, 1995). Exploratory talk is a type of talk in which statements and suggestions offered ‘may be challenged and counter-challenged, but challenges are justified and alternative hypotheses are offered’ (Mercer, 1995, p. 104) and ‘[p]rogress then rests on the joint acceptance of one of the suggestions, or of a modification of what has been put forward’ (Fisher, 1993, p. 255).

Exploratory talk is considered to be the most effective type of talk (Fisher, 1993; Mercer, 1995) in comparison with the other two types of talk (cumulative talk and disputational talk). The above extract also seems to confirm the value of exploratory talk in the construction of valuable knowledge in convergent tasks. However, what we need to consider here is what causes students to engage in such exploratory talk and whether it is exploratory talk which causes the discovery of truth and expertise or whether it is expertise and knowledge of truth which leads to exploratory talk.

In the two extracts, the same students working on the same discussion task at times engaged successfully through exploratory talk in the discovery of truth and at other times failed to arrive at the truth. This seems to imply that when they failed, it was not because they did not know how to reason or how to engage in exploratory talk, but probably more because none of them had the expert knowledge in such cases to trigger them to engage in exploratory talk. Unless required knowledge and expertise is already in their potential developmental level, and unless there is a more capable peer to help the students to move from the potential developmental level to the actual developmental level, the use of additive and reactive framing alone will not help them discover the true justified knowledge required for the successful completion of convergent tasks. The use of exploratory talk is unlikely to be triggered either.

On the other hand, when they succeeded, it is likely that the knowledge required for the task was already in their potential developmental level (e.g. S’s knowledge of the fact that ‘enjoy’ needs something, Y’s and A’s knowledge of the need for the present simple tense). Together with these various knowledge sources, another contributing factor for their success was that they worked collaboratively towards a single goal, using various types of idea framing—such as ‘contradicting’, ‘converging’, ‘explaining’, and ‘concluding’—to justify their choices and discover the truth. Knowledge sources in their potential developmental level were pooled together and converged towards a single goal, their truthfulness being reacted to and justified.

From the examination of the above two extracts, it is possible that the success of convergent tasks depends on the possession of expertise and knowledge by the group, together with their ability to justify and react to the truthfulness of ideas, and the ability to work collaboratively towards convergent goals by accumulating and building upon each other’s ideas. Learning in convergent tasks is discovery of a truth, which is already predetermined. As Vygotsky (1978) notes, students cannot discover truth which is well beyond their potential developmental level; nor can they discover it without collaborating with more capable peers or experts. It is possible that without expert knowledge required to solve the problem, exploratory talk is unlikely to be triggered.

# 6. Implications for EAP and pedagogy

EAP courses can be seen as promoting two types of competence: communicative competence and academic competence.

In the former, students are trained in ‘those communication skills in English which are required for study purposes in formal education systems’ (ETIC, 1975 cited in

Jordan, 1997, p. 1). In terms of EAP for speaking skills, examples of such skills are communication skills required for participating in seminars or group discussions such as ‘getting clarification’, ‘questioning’, ‘disagreeing’, ‘expressing opinion’, ‘signpost expressions’, ‘responding to questions’ etc. (e.g. see Lynch & Anderson, 1992; Rignall and Furneaux, 1997). EAP programmes conducted for NNS students often take this view and such communicative skills form the major part of many EAP materials and EAP examinations for NNS students.

In the latter, students are trained in the use of effective study and academic skills, an aspect of EAP that has been widely implemented in many programmes for NS students, but not so much in those for NNS students. ‘There is a vast array of literature of all kinds aimed at helping pupils and students, whose mother tongue is English, with aspects of study skills’ (Jordan, 1997, p. 15) but they are seldom referred to in books for NNS. Academic competence and study skills are not something acquired instinctively and the development of academic competence should be considered in academic programmes for both NS and NNS students. In terms of EAP for speaking skills, examples of skills which are concerned with academic competence are skills required for taking part in effective talk for learning, and for the discovery of valuable knowledge. For example, in convergent tasks, the ability to engage in exploratory talk and interact in the ZPD will be considered as important characteristics of successful academic performance.

EAP programmes are rich in reading and writing skills but not so much in academic speaking skills. The type of speaking skills found in those materials often aims at improving communicative skills for participation in discussions and seminars rather than improving students’ academic competence for the successful completion of tasks or the discovery of valuable knowledge required for tasks. As argued above, just participating and talking cannot be equated with learning and successful academic performance (also see Stubbs, 1976). In other words, just equipping students with communicative skills such as taking part in discussion, interrupting, etc. does not guarantee successful academic performance.

Academic speaking skill programmes should take into consideration the importance of raising students’ awareness of academic competence and characteristics of effective talk for the construction of valuable knowledge. Although exploratory talk is desirable for learning, as noted by many researchers, the analysis in this article suggests the possibility that exploratory talk is unlikely to be triggered without expertise and knowledge especially where convergent tasks are concerned. This indicates the importance of nurturing academic strategies not in isolation but in combination with academic knowledge and expertise. In her discussion of language learning strategies, Bialystok (1990) argues that strategies are the outcome of language competence and processing. This suggests the need to nurture communication strategies not in isolation but in combination with language knowledge. Applying this to EAP, it is important to nurture academic strategies not in isolation but in combination with academic knowledge as it is possible that exploratory talk is the outcome rather than the cause of knowledge. This in turn suggests the need to integrate EAP programmes with students’ academic subject programmes more closely.

It is also important to put students with diverse expertise and knowledge together in the same group so that they can bring their various knowledge sources to bear on the tasks. In this way, knowledgeable participants can act as more capable peers at various stages to help the group solve the problems and complete the tasks successfully.
