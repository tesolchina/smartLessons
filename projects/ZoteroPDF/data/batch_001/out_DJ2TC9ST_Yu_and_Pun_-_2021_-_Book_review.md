# The Secret Life of English-Medium Instruction in Higher Education: Examining Microphenomena in Context, David Block, Sarah Khan (Eds.). Routledge, London/New York (2020). p. 148 pp 9780367437725, 9781003005667. Hbk: UK37.59, eBo0k: UK13.59

English-medium instruction (EMI) is now a global phenomenon in higher education (HE) institutions and has provided the impetus for an increasing number of research programs exploring the implementation of EMI in HE (e.g., Macaro, Curle, Pun, An, & Dearden, 2018; Richards & Pun, 2021). Edited by Block and Khan, this book furthers the discussion by investigating how EMI iscrred out in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects at two Catalan universities in Spain: the Universtat de Lleida (UdL) and the Universtat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC). The book presents four empirically based chapters organized around an overarching theme of the secret life of EMI, which refers to minute aspects of the implementation of EM in HE that often go unnoticed by administraors and EMI practitioners. Together, these comprehensible and compelling chapters adopt an ethnographically oriented, microscopic view of EMI in action, documenting examples of current practice and offering research-base recommendations relevant to HE around the world..

In the opening chapter, Block and Khan set the scene by providing background information about the book. Chapter 2, by Arno Macia and Aguilar-Perez, identifies the reasons behind students' and lecturers' choice of EMI or L1-medium instruction, illstrating the role of language in mediating advanced disciplinary content. In Chapter 3, Moncada-Comas presents a multimodal analysis of a brief episode of classroom interaction from the perspective of social identity, and this multimodal focus is maintained in Chapter 4, where Sabate-Dalmau examines students resistance to the English monolingual norm of EMI. Chapter 5, by Block and Mancho-Bares, investigates how EMI lecturers occasionally act as English language teachers despite claiming to be deliverers of only disciplinary content. The book closes with Khan's reflection, which revisits the major themes identified by the contributors as pivotal to EMI.

A significant theme to emerge from the book is the perpetuation of social inequalit, which is mentioned frequently not only in European-based EMI research (Macaro, 2018), but also further afield in Asia (Hu & Lei, 2014; Pillr & Cho, 2013). Arno and Aguilar (Chapter 2) and Sabate-Dalmau (Chapter 4) are in agreement with existing literature on the elitist nature of EMI and claim that EMI benefits only a small segment of the student population. Given the heighted polarization caused by EMI, their studies highlight the need for pre-EMI language support, social and academic counseling, and esential in-classcaffolding (e.g, multilingual matrials, classrom interaction, form-focused instruction, diversifying evaluation) to mitigate these inequalities. The contributors further extend the focus on equality to include EMI lecturers, investigating whether lecturer self-selection for EMI is a standard practice resulting from intitutional policy and educational goals. They demonstrate that EMI courses appear to be bottom-up and depend on lecturers willinns t tech in Enish, rathr than top-dw policy drien. Ahough differing in yr f xperience, the ecturers were alltrilingual (Spanish, Catalan, and English), had reached at least a C1 (CEFR) level of proficiency in English, had had inter. national teaching experience, and firmly supported EMI and internationalization. Existing social inequalities seems to determine the kind of lecturers that volunteer for EMI, in the same way that EMI excludes many students.

By bringing to light the issue of inequality, the contributorsto this volume draw atention to how principal educational agents (teachers and students) perform their role in an EMI classoom. Working from a critical sociolinguisics perspective, Sabate-Dalmau (Chapter 4) demonstrates that both parties embody neoliberal identities advocating internationalization and regarding English as pivotal to empoability and caer successin sciece. In practie, however, both techer and tudnts are foundto distance themseles from these neoliberal identities and the English-only norm by interacting in local languages and non-standard forms of English. This highlights the plurilingual nature of the EMI classroom, where the agents employ thir multilingual esources in classroom tasks to avoid breakdown and gaps in communication. As a result, the study reinforces the importance of promoting use of multilingual languages in an EMI classroom and readjusting the idea that EMI stands for English-only' instruction. In addition, other communi. cative modes are also at play in an EMI clasroom. Moncada-Comas (Chapter 3) focuses on the multimodal nature of EMI students interaction with each other (body gestures, eye contact, gaze facial expressions), which illstrates how students alternate between frontstage doing education' role (students engaging in academic discourse, using expert language, answering the lectrer's questions, and explaining discipline-rlated content to peers) and backstage being a student role students refraning from interactional dynamic of the classoom, showing a decrease in enthusiasm and initiating a parallel side talk on-topic interaction with peers. These two chapters offer a more fine-grained understanding of how lecturers and students employ plurilingual and multimodal resources to make sense of their EMI experience and facilitate in-class communication.

In line with existing EMI research (e.g. Hellekjaer, 2006; Jiang, Zhang, & May, 2019), the chapters of this book that draw on empirical research further demonstrate that the use of plurilingual and multimodal resource is associated with the challenges brought by disciplinary complexty and infrequent use of English by students. In Arno and Agular's study (Chapter 2),both lecturer and students see the subject dificulty levels as a strong deterrent for enrolment in EMI courses. In Chapter 3, Moncada-Comas finds that English is being used to teach disciplinary content and has limited use and input, while L1 languages are frequently used in peer-to-peer interaction in an EMI class As the two contributions suggest, efective EMI requires a delicate balance between getting disciplinary knowledge acrossin English, and providing students with English-learning opportunities o practice becoming proficient in speaking and writing in the discipline. Based on the understanding of these challenges, Mancho-Bares and Block (Chapter 5) focus readers' attention on the topic of assesment, llustrting how EMI lecturers incorporate language parameters into evaluation of students' oral presentation. Their study encourages readers to contemplate the more fundamental questions; namely, what role language plays in education and how language molds lecturing and learning regardless of the subject being taught.

One issue that could be further addressed throughout the volume i the impact of EMI on English language and content learning. As with the majorit of EMI in HE research, the empirical chapters of this book ground their analyses in case studies carried out within single institutions, and are therefore unable to account for the extent to which EMI may facilitate English language learning while \*not demonstrating any excesive cost toconten lening (Macaro et a., 2018, .38). One possible way of gaining accessto this issue is to encourage contributors to collaborate on comparative studies among HE institutions (in this case, UdL and UPC), evaluating the impact of EMI and drilling down into reasons for the finding. One topic scarcely discussed in the book is possible variable in stakeholders perceptions of EMI such as gender, different disciplines, and different year levels. Although this is perhaps beyond the scope of the volume, there is a clear need for future research to explore variability in students backgrounds before reaching any general conclusions concerning the introduction and implementation of EMI (Macaro et al., 2018).

All i all this book provides a snapshot coverage of the implementation of EMI in STEM contexts at two Catalan universities in Spain, with an appropriate emphasis on teachers' and students perceptions and atitudes towards EMI, and real-life classroom interactions. While it focuses on a specific sociocultural context, this volume i rich in insights into EMI practices at a time when MI seems to provide HE teachers and students with more challenges than opportunities (Macaro et al., 2018). The challenges and pedagogical implications presented are valuable guiding sources for worldwide HE institutions implementing EMI. Given its inno. vative and detailed content, the book is especially beneficial to a wide range of audiences, including researchers wanting to keep themselves informed on the latest developments of EMI in HE, EMI practitioners willing to have a critical reflection on their professional practice, EMI policymakers seeking to promote qualit learning and teaching practices, and research students interested in the role and use of English in HE worldwide.
