# ABSTRACT

Adopting a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach, this study explored the impact of electronic writing portfolio on writing performance in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. Two intact classes were first selected and randomly assigned to an electronic writing portfolio group (22 EFL students) and a conventional (i.e. paper-based) writing portfolio group (23 EFL students). To collect the quantitative data, timed writing tasks were administered before and after the electronic and conventional writing portfolio courses, and to collect the qualitative data, the students’ peer writing mediations were tracked during the courses and an individual semi-structured interview was conducted at the end of the electronic writing portfolio course. One-way ANCOVA and Pearson Chi square were applied to analyse the quantitative data and microgenetic method and thematic analysis were run to analyse the qualitative data. The findings showed both electronic and conventional writing portfolio instructions developed the EFL students’ writing performance. In addition, the electronic writing portfolio group outperformed its conventional counterpart in developing writing performance. The qualitative data analyses, used to explain the quantitative findings, further revealed the EFL students’ microgenetic development of writing content, writing organisation, and language use in the electronic writing portfolio group, as well as the students’ positive perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio course. Pearson Chi-square analysis also indicated that the distributions of content-, organisation-, and language-related peer writing mediations between the two groups were significantly different which confirmed that the electronic students provided more content-, organisation-, and language-related peer writing mediations during the collaborative writing activities. Practical implications are discussed next.

# 1.  Introduction

In recent years, there has been a fundamental shift from a product-oriented to a process-oriented approach of writing instruction. In a process-oriented approach, students are involved in such process writing stages as pre-writing activities, planning, drafting, revising, and editing before achieving the final writing draft (Carless & Boud, 2018; Krashen, 1984; Lee et  al., 2016; Seow, 2002). A process-oriented approach to writing instruction requires a process-oriented assessment that offers a monistic view of writing instruction and writing assessment. According to Poehner (2008), ‘a monistic view of assessment and instruction is providing learners with mediation, or appropriate forms of support, in order to simultaneously understand and promote their abilities’ (p. 12). One form of monistic writing assessment is writing portfolio (Earl, 2013), which refers to a purposeful collection of students’ writing drafts that shows students’ progress and achievements in writing (Lorenzo & Ittelson, 2005; Paulson et  al., 1991).

It is argued that the time allotment which is usually given to process writing restricts students’ writing portfolio in the class (Seow, 2002; Wolf et  al., 1991). That is, as process writing is a time-consuming activity, instructors do not follow it in the class and students are reluctant to spend a long time completing their writing tasks. Online applications help students manage the time allotment given to the process writing activities and provide a convenient and user-friendly space for students to work on their writing tasks collaboratively and/or individually both in and outside the class (Adnan, 2017; Ebadi & Rahimi, 2017, 2018, 2019; Fathi & Rahimi, 2020; Rahimi & Fathi, 2021, 2022; Wang et  al., 2018; Wanner & Palmer, 2015; Yeh et  al., 2011; Zou & Xie, 2019). Similarly, electronic portfolios (online portfolios) could advance conventional portfolios (paper-based portfolios) by incorporating more audios, videos, images, and hyperlinks for students’ further learning improvements (Cummins & Davesne, 2009).

Employing an online platform, instructors can share electronic material and writing assignments, assign deadline to assignment submissions, take quizzes, and monitor students’ writing progress (Holland & Muilenburg, 2011; Trust, 2017). In the electronic writing portfolio environment, different folders could be created for different groups’ collaborative writing activities so that students can upload and store their different collaborative writing drafts within the related folders through their own account for future references. The related materials, instructional videos, and links to different websites are further provided within the same folders to help students improve their collaborative writing tasks. Additionally, electronic writing portfolio allows students to provide comments, feedback, and edit and evaluate the collaborative writing tasks, and provides a more effective and permanent learning environment by tracking students’ writing performance (Trust, 2017). Electronic writing portfolio, along with face-to-face instruction, can create a blended learning environment (Pardede, 2012). In such a blended learning environment, students can check the online materials before the class time and engage in collaborative learning activities during the class time. However, there is a lack of research in EFL context, especially in EFL university context, exploring the impact of electronic writing portfolio on EFL undergraduate students’ writing content, writing organisation, and language use (i.e. grammatical range and accuracy, lexicon, & writing mechanics).

In EFL university context in developing countries, instructors still employ conventional teaching procedures in writing courses. This means that incorporating online applications for portfolio writing, collaborative writing activities, formative writing assessment, and other process-based strategies are absent from the majority of writing classes. As a result, an electronic writing portfolio course may help such EFL students accomplish their collaborative writing activities more effectively, since language learning tasks and other related materials are regularly uploaded and used on this platform and it can track students’ activities, assignments, and their progress (Lam et  al., 2018). The present study, therefore, attempted to explore the role of electronic writing portfolio on EFL students’ (i.e. undergraduates) writing performance by focusing on the students’ writing content, writing organisation, and language use. Moreover, the EFL students’ peer writing mediations were tracked and their attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio were explored to further clarify the impact of electronic writing portfolio on the EFL students’ writing performance at the university level. The findings propose effective instructional procedures and useful techniques to develop EFL students’ writing performance (their writing content, writing organisation, and language use).

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Social constructivist theory

The theoretical framework of the present study is based on Vygotsky’s (1984) social constructivist theory of learning. According to Vygotsky (1984), individuals’ cognitive abilities are subject to collaborations with other capable peers. Vygotsky argues that students’ interactions with other capable peers can gradually lead to their internalisation and autonomous functioning of higher forms of consciousness. In Vygotsky’s social constructivism, the difference between students’ other-regulation, which occurs in interaction with more capable peers, and self-regulation, which is the internalisation of cognitive abilities, is conceptualised as students’ zone of proximal development (ZPD) (1984). Therefore, for students to achieve their potential level of functioning (i.e. their ZPD) and self-regulate the new skills, collaborative assistance (i.e. mediation) needs to be provided by more capable students through the process of other-regulation (Donato, 1994; Lantolf & Thorne, 2006; Neumann & McDonough, 2015; Vygotsky, 1978).

It is claimed that students’ other-regulation is not only limited to interactions between less and more capable individuals, but also interactions among all students (with different proficiency levels) in pair and group work activities. This is due to the fact that all students can act as more capable and less capable individuals in order to support each other in collaborative learning tasks (Donato, 1994; Kim, 2008; Storch, 2002; Swain & Lapkin, 1998; Teng, 2021). It is argued that students have different language skills and knowledge which can share with other students in pair and group work activities to collaboratively accomplish the required tasks, co-construct their language skills, and achieve their ZPD (Donato, 2004; Kim, 2008; Neumann & McDonough, 2015; Rahimi & Fathi, 2021; Teng, 2021). According to Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994), students, engaging in collaborative writing activities, can provide and receive more explicit mediations only if they are not able to address their writing issues through more implicit mediations. Students who are relied on only minimal or implicit peer mediations are closer to their self-regulation and automatisation in learning (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994).

In the present context, Vygotsky’s social constructivism was followed in both electronic and conventional writing portfolio classes to involve the EFL students in co-constructive writing activities. It was supposed that reflecting on writing portfolios (students’ writings from pre-writing activities to final writing drafts), students gradually internalise what they learn in collaborative writing activities and achieve their ZPD (Vygotsky, 1978). The difference between the two groups in the current study, however, was running either electronic writing portfolio or conventional writing portfolio to explore and compare the impact of these two forms of instruction on the students’ writing performance in EFL context.

# 2.2.  Electronic writing portfolio

A portfolio could be defined as ‘a systematic and selective collection of student work that has been assembled to demonstrate student motivation, academic growth, and level of achievement’ (Norton & Wiburg, 1998, p. 237). Portfolios are thought to promote students’ motivation (Lee,  2017), self-regulated learning (Lam, 2017), self-reflection (Paulson et  al., 1991), self-efficacy (Martínez et  al., 2022), and self-evaluation (Tierney et  al., 1991). In particular, writing portfolio integrates writing instruction and writing assessment and aims at developing students’ writing performance (Lam, 2014; Panadero & Romero, 2014). Writing portfolios consider students active participants in both learning and assessment processes, since can determine their writing goals and activities, and at the end, understand about their long-term achievement and significant accomplishments (Wolf et al., 1991). According to Hamp-Lyons and Condon (2000), a writing portfolio comprises three main elements of collection (i.e. collecting, tracking, and improving writing drafts), reflection (i.e. self-assessing and self-regulating), and selection (i.e. choosing writing drafts that students are most satisfied with). There are two types of writing portfolio: conventional or paper-based portfolio uses papers to collect and present students’ writing drafts, and electronic portfolio utilises various online applications and programmes to collect and present students’ work (Chiu et  al., 2021; Genesee & Upshur, 1996; Godwin-Jones, 2008; Lam, 2017; Lorenzo & Ittelson, 2005).

The audio-visual features of electronic writing portfolio provide students with a stimulating online environment forcollaborative writing activities. In addition, electronic writing portfolios help students organise their writing drafts in different formats without occupying much space online, and help them upload and download their writing drafts whenever and wherever they think is appropriate (Godwin-Jones, 2008; Meyer et  al., 2010). A number of social networking websites and online applications have been used to conduct electronic writing portfolio courses (e.g. Aydin, 2010; Barrot, 2016, 2021). Barrot (2016), for instance, examined the effect of Facebook-supported writing portfolio on first-year EFL students’ writing performance through a self-report questionnaire. The findings indicated that Facebook-based writing portfolio helped the students monitor their progress, reflect on their writing drafts, and practise more writing. It was also revealed that the online environment made the students more cautious about their writing content, writing organisation, and language use. Furthermore, some challenges of Facebook-supported writing portfolio instruction, such as difficulty in typing and reading texts, were reported by the EFL students.

Kongsuebchart and Suppasetseree (2018) explored the impact of electronic writing portfolio on EFL undergraduate students’ writing skills on the one hand, and their perceptions towards the weblog-based electronic writing portfolio course on the other hand. Adopting a pre-test, post-test research design, and reflective journals and a questionnaire for collecting the required data, the findings indicated that electronic writing portfolio was an effective instructional procedure for improving the EFL students’ writing skills. Moreover, the findings revealed that the students held positive perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio course. For instance, the students claimed that weblog-based electronic portfolio helped them improve their writing skills, collaborate with their peers and instructors conveniently, access information for their writing tasks, and accomplish the engaging exercises. The students also stated that they easily did the process writing online, since the stages for process writing were well-organised and they received useful and adequate feedback from the other peers and the instructor.

There are different online platforms which could be used for electronic writing portfolio courses. In the present study, Edmodo (https://new. edmodo.com/), which is a free online platform (i.e. it is not used for any commercial purposes), was applied in the electronic writing portfolio class. Edmodo was introduced in the United States in 2008 as a free and safe educational learning network to offer a simple venue for educators. Edmodo allows instructors to construct and manage an online classroom community, and helps learners connect and work with their peers and the instructor synchronously and asynchronously (Charoenwet & Christensen, 2016; Kongchan, 2008; Krutka et  al., 2014; Lam et  al., 2018; Mills & Chandra, 2011; Won et al., 2015). Edmodo is a cloud-based social and interactive learning platform which is used for instructional purposes and allows students to view and make modifications on the required learning tasks anywhere and anytime (Chang et  al., 2016). Edmodo has 12 subject communities (e.g. Language Arts & Computer Technology) that create an online environment for instructors to connect with other instructors for exchanging subject-specific ideas, resources, and skills. Edmodo, particularly, helps learners and instructors get connected, exchange ideas and electronic materials, and deal with challenges in language learning. Instructors are able to assign and mark learning tasks on Edmodo and learners can receive assistance from the whole class on this secure learning environment.

Creating an Edmodo-based online class, instructors are provided with a code that they can share with students to invite them to the class so that students can safely interact with other peers and the instructor in a private online environment. Instructors and students can share different files, such as images, hyperlinks, videos, audios, assignments, and other multimedia and electronic materials. Students’ assignments/tasks and their related explanations could be uploaded on the webpage and other group members can be requested to submit their own assignments regularly according to a schedule and also contribute to other peers’ tasks. Edmodo, as a great platform for students’ collaborative learning activities, can also track students’ activities, assignments, and their progress, which could be accessible through an Excel file (Won et  al., 2015).

# 3.  Purpose of the study

Although the review of the literature showed the positive influence of electronic writing portfolio on EFL students’ writing performance (Barrot, 2016; Lam et  al., 2018), the impact of electronic writing portfolio on students’ writing content, writing organisation, and language use (i.e. grammatical range and accuracy, lexicon, & writing mechanics) has not been sufficiently examined in EFL context. In order to explore this research lacuna more deeply, the present study employed a mixed-methods approach to initially examine the impact of electronic writing portfolio on EFL undergraduate students’ writing content, writing organisation, and language use quantitatively. Following Vygotsky’s social constructivism, the EFL students’ microgenetic writing development in three areas of writing content, writing organisation, and language use was also tracked qualitatively to show how EFL undergraduate students’ peer writing mediations on collaborative writing activities in the electronic writing portfolio group were gradually changed from other-regulation to self-regulation. Additionally, the undergraduate students’ attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio were explored qualitatively at the end of the course to further support the findings of the study. That is, individual interviews were conducted with some of the participants in the electronic writing portfolio class to further find out about the electronic-based affordances and procedures which helped the EFL students do the collaborative writing tasks more effectively. To accomplish these objectives, the following research questions were formulated:

1. Compared to conventional writing portfolio (i.e. paper-based writing portfolio), how effective is electronic writing portfolio in developing EFL undergraduate students’ writing performance?   
2. What attitudes and perceptions do EFL undergraduate students hold towards electronic writing portfolio?

# 4.  Method

# 4.1.  Design of the study

The present study employed a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design (Creswell et  al., 2003; Ivankova et  al., 2006). To this aim, quantitative data were initially collected and analysed, followed by qualitative data collections and analyses. To explore the impact of electronic writing portfolio on EFL students’ writing performance, data were first collected and analysed quantitatively. Next, microgenetic writing development and an individual semi-structured interview were carried out with the group that outperformed the other one in writing performance to further explain the quantitative findings. That is, subsequent qualitative data collections and analyses were conducted to explain and clarify the initial quantitative findings.

# 4.2.  Context and participants

Adopting a convenience sampling method (Dörnyei, 2007), a total of 45 EFL students, whose native language was either Kurdish or Persian, formed the participants of the present study. The participants were undergraduate students, included both male and female learners, and their age ranged from 20 to 24 years old. The participating students were in two intact classes which were randomly assigned to an electronic writing portfolio group (i.e. experimental group) and a conventional writing portfolio group (i.e. control group) and were taught by the same researcher/instructor who was both familiar with and interested in applying online platforms to EFL classes.

Although concerns regarding sample size might be raised, following ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages) (2010), a class size should be around 15 students, especially in student-centred classes in order to provide adequate collaborative learning activities. This means that students can have adequate collaborative learning activities in a class of no more than 15 students (ACTFL, 2010). Therefore, following the position statement by ACTFL, we deemed the number of EFL students in both groups appropriate to both implement sufficient collaborative writing activities during the class time and obtain more reliable and valid findings.

A small number of the participants had already experienced portfolio in writing instructions, but no one had ever experienced electronic writing portfolio. Therefore, some general explanations regarding the instructional design of the electronic writing portfolio were given to the participants before conducting the treatment. Furthermore, prior to conducting the treatment, Oxford Placement Test (OPT) (Allan, 2004) was used to ensure the homogeneity of the two groups with respect to their general English language proficiency level. An independent samples t-test, applied to examine the differences between the two groups, showed no initial significant differences between the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups in terms of English language proficiency $\left[ t \ \left( 1 , \ 4 3 \right) \right. = \left. - 1 . 0 8 \right.$ , $p \ : = \ : . 2 8 ]$ .

The participating EFL students were taking a beginning writing course at the university which was a two-credit course in the bachelor’s programme presented 2 hours each week for one term long (approximately 12 weeks). During the Bachelor of Arts (BA) programme, EFL students are required to pass two writing courses which are called beginning and advanced writing courses. In the beginning writing course, students are introduced to the structure of writing and they are taught paragraph writing. During this course, students get familiar with various types of paragraphs, such as descriptive, process, and comparison and contrastive paragraphs. In the advanced writing course, EFL students work on more advanced essay writings. The EFL students were taking the beginning writing course at the time of the current study.

# 4.3.  Materials and instruments

# 4.3.1.  Academic writing: from paragraph to essay

The book Academic writing: from paragraph to essay by Zemach and Rumisek (2003) was used as the coursebook in both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups to improve essay writing of the EFL students. Following Zemach and Rumisek (2003), this book is aimed at developing intermediate EFL students’ paragraph writing. As the book comprises focused writing lessons, exercises, and practice opportunities, it is often selected and applied as an effective writing coursebook for EFL students.

# 4.3.2.  Oxford placement test

OPT, developed by Allan (2004), was used to check the English language proficiency level of the students in both groups before embarking upon the study. OPT comprises 200 items measuring listening and reading skills, and grammar and vocabulary sub-skills. Allan (2004) argues that OPT could be administered to any English students to make sure about accurate and reliable grading and placing of students into different group levels. According to Allan (2004), the English language proficiency level of OPT was checked by comparing it with such major international examinations as Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and Cambridge ESOL (English to Speakers of other Languages) Examination.

# 4.3.3.  Timed writing essays

Two 50-minute writing tasks, adopted from the book TOEFL writing: Topics and model essays by Du Hoc (2010), were used as the pre- and post-tests of the study. The writing tasks included two general topics that did not require the students to have any particular background knowledge. The topics of the pre- and post-tests were as follows:

a. Pre-test topic: Should a city try to preserve its old and historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.   
b. Post-test topic: Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.

These topics were comparable for writing performance, since both topics required the students to express their opinions, beliefs, and ideas about particular subjects. The students could use modal auxiliary verbs, such as might, would, ought to, etc., transition words, like initially, after that, eventually, etc., and connectors of cause and effect to express and support their opinions.

To mark the students’ essays, Jacobs et  al. (1981) writing scale (see Appendix A), which follows an analytical marking procedure, was adopted. This rubric comprises a 100-point scheme based on which 50 points are allocated to the content and organisation of writing, 25 points to language use (mainly syntax), 15 points to lexicon, and 10 points to writing mechanics. Totally, 50 per cent of the marks allotted to the writing quality pertains to global aspects (writing content and writing organisation) and 50 per cent to language use (grammatical range and accuracy, lexicon, & writing mechanics). The inter-rater reliability of the essay marks was checked not only by the researcher/instructor but also by another independent, trained rater. All the students’ writing tests in both groups were made autonomous and randomly given to the raters to mark them. The assigned marks of the two raters were checked by Cohen’s Kappa’s inter-rater reliability test, reporting a reliability index of 0.84.

# 4.3.4.  Interview

As sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach was conducted, qualitative data collections were also carried out with the experimental group, which outperformed the control group, to further explain about the quantitative findings. In addition to the students’ peer writing mediations, an individual semi-structured interview was conducted with 10 students (see Appendix B) to explore the attitudes and perceptions of the EFL students towards the electronic writing portfolio course. The interview questions were developed based on a thorough analysis of the literature. The developed interview questions were given to some experts and experienced researchers in applied linguistics to add and/or delete questions and modify the wording of the questions, if needed, and also to confirm the validity of the questions. Following Flick (2004), for the individual semi-structured interview, the structure of the predetermined interview questions changed from highly-structured to highly unstructured questions and the interviewees could proceed in their own way.

Caution was exercised to select a range of EFL students who received low, mid, and high marks in the writing post-tests. In addition, all the students were volunteered to participate in the individual semi-structured interview. The interviews were conducted in the students’ first language (i.e. Kurdish or Persian) and each took around 30 minutes. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then translated into English. The credibility of the interview data was checked through member checking techniques (Creswell, 2007). To this aim, to ensure the accuracy of the responses in the interview sessions, the questions were further clarified for the participating EFL students during the interview session. Furthermore, the transcribed interviews were sent back to the participants to check for their accuracy. S1, S2, …., and S10 were used as the EFL students’ pseudonyms to protect their identities.

# 4.4.  Procedures

First, the students in both the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups took the timed-writing essay task as a pre-test which was evaluated in the areas of content, organisation, and language use (grammatical range and accuracy, lexicon, & writing mechanics) using Jacobs et  al. (1981) marking rubric. Both groups were taught by the same researcher/instructor according to the same curriculum on the same paragraph types by using the same main materials; however, the control group received writing instruction in paper-based writing portfolio, whereas the experimental group received electronic writing portfolio instruction. Classroom-portfolio model by Hamp-Lyons and Condon (2000) was followed in both groups. The main focus of this model is on learning rather than final assessment and the portfolio procedures consists mainly of collection, selection, and reflection.

The tenets of process-oriented writing instruction were followed in both groups. After being introduced to each paragraph type, students in both groups were required to produce a sample as an assignment. For each paragraph type, the students were provided with the related theoretical information and some related writing samples. The students wrote the first draft of each assignment; they received feedback on the first draft; and they wrote the subsequent and final drafts. In both groups, a great portion of the students’ final mark was allocated to their writing assignments and the rest of the mark was devoted to their final writing exam and their class performance. Therefore, this motivated the students in both groups to do their best for the writing activities. A step-by-step explanation of the procedures followed in both groups is presented next.

# 4.4.1.  Electronic writing portfolio

In the electronic writing portfolio group, an Edmodo class was initially created, then, the participants were invited through a link to become members of the online class. A sample educational video, selected from YouTube, was presented to the students to provide them with a step-bystep guideline on how to partake in an electronic writing portfolio on https://www.edmodo.com and how to publish materials online. At the beginning of each session in the class time, the EFL students were introduced to the basics and theoretical principles of the paragraph type they were supposed to accomplish. The researcher/instructor modelled a sample paragraph, showing the students how to choose a topic and how to structure that specific target paragraph. The students also discussed the sample paragraph with the researcher/instructor and other students in the classroom. Next, the vocabulary items and structures relevant to the target paragraph type were introduced and practised. The researcher/instructor also shared some relevant website links on Edmodo in order to provide a condition for the students to learn more about the topic of the writing task. The students could choose whatever websites to check in their convenient time and they were asked to reflect on their experiences and publish their thoughts online.

Afterwards, the students used different techniques, like brainstorming and freewriting, to choose a writing topic and plan what they were going to write (pre-writing stage). The pre-writing stage was done during the class time but other stages of the writing process were accomplished by the students online. Afterwards, the students wrote the first draft of their assignment and uploaded it in a related folder on Edmodo. Each student was also required to read their friends’ writings on Edmodo and provide peer writing mediations (i.e. comments, feedback, and editing) related to writing content, writing organisation, and language use. After the students’ initial comments and feedback and their revisions of the first writing drafts, the researcher/instructor further helped the students provide more comments and feedback on the second writing drafts. Finally, the students were required to revise their writing tasks based on the comments and feedback they received and write and publish the final writing draft. The final writing drafts were supposed to be marked and analysed by the researcher/instructor and another experienced researcher at the end of the writing course. The students were further asked to write a reflection of their writing processes with regard to the target paragraph type and put it in the related folder on Edmodo. The processes involved in accomplishing a writing paragraph collaboratively and its subsequent online storing have been demonstrated in Figure 1 as an example.

# 4.4.2.  Conventional writing portfolio

The main principles of the process approach for teaching writing, which were followed in the electronic writing portfolio group, were also used in the conventional writing portfolio group. The students in the conventional writing portfolio group also received the same amount of paragraph writing instruction. This denotes that the same writing activities followed in the electronic writing portfolio group were conducted in the conventional writing portfolio group as well. However, the difference between the two groups was that unlike the conventional writing portfolio class, the students’ writing portfolio in the experimental group was conducted electronically. The students in the conventional writing portfolio group were not required to use the Internet to publish their writing assignments and they were not supposed to visit relevant websites which contained activities on paragraph writing. Although in the electronic writing portfolio class, electronic-learning materials were used to develop the EFL students’ writing performance and in the conventional writing portfolio class, the conventional print format was used, the content in both classes remained the same. The EFL students in the conventional writing portfolio class were asked to keep all their writing drafts and final versions of their writing assignments in one document so that they were marked and analysed by the researcher/instructor and another experienced researcher at the end of the writing course.

Figure 1. T he processes involved in doing a writing paragraph in the electronic writing portfolio class.

At the beginning of the term, the researcher/instructor introduced the purpose and design of the writing portfolio assessment. The conventional students wrote about the same writing topics and genres followed in the electronic-based writing portfolio group. The coursebook also provided the students with writing structures and format, some generated ideas related to writing topics, key words, and writing model, which showed the students how to write appropriately. From the second session on, the students were asked to write the required essay at home and bring it to the class next session. In the class time, the students were supposed to provide feedback and comments on their peers’ different writing components: writing content, writing organisation, and language use (grammatical range and accuracy, vocabulary, & writing mechanics). The students, addressing their peers’ feedback and comments, revised and submitted the writing assignments back to the peers for more evaluations. Finally, the researcher/instructor provided more feedback and comments on the students’ writing tasks so that the students could revise their writing one more time before delivering the final draft. The processes involved in completing a writing paragraph have been presented in Figure 2 as an example.

The writing courses in each group lasted for one term, which was equal to twelve weeks. The students in each group received 30 hours of in-class writing instruction and five writing tasks were accomplished in each group. At the end of the writing courses, the second timed-writing essay task was administered as a post-test to measure the differences between the two groups’ writing performance. The EFL students’ peer writing mediations in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups were further identified, transcribed, and analysed. Furthermore, an individual semi-structured interview was conducted with 10 participants of the electronic writing portfolio group on the last day of the course in order to help the students verbalise a retrospective reflection of their experience with the electronic-based writing portfolio course. The reason was that the electronic writing portfolio group outperformed the conventional writing portfolio group in writing performance, as corroborated in the result section, and following the sequential explanatory design of mixed-methods approach, more qualitative data collections and analyses (in this study, individual semi-structured interviews) needed to be conducted with the more-successful group to further explain about the findings.

# 4.5.  Data analysis

# 4.5.1.  Quantitative analysis

In the quantitative section of this study, continuous marks were assigned to the EFL students’ writing performance in both groups. In addition, checking the normality of the writing pre- and post-test data via Kolmogorov-Smirno test, it was found that the data for both pre- and post-tests in both groups were normal. As the significance values of Kolmogorov-Smirno test was more than 0.05 $( \mathrm { S i g } \ > \ 0 . 0 5 )$ and there were no outliers, it was confirmed that the data for both pre- and post-writing tests were normally distributed. Thus, parametric test of one-way between-groups analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) (Pallant, 2013) was adopted to examine the students’ writing performance in general and writing content, writing organisation, and language use in particular in both groups.

That is, for investigating the impact of the electronic and conventional writing portfolio instructions on the EFL students’ writing performance, and writing content, writing organisation, and language use and to examine the differences between the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups in this regard, ANCOVA was applied. The electronic writing portfolio instruction was considered the independent variable and the EFL students’ performance on the post-tests (i.e. the 50-minute writing task), investigating the EFL students’ writing performance, writing content, writing organisation, and language use were considered the dependent variables. The students’ pre-test marks were regarded as covariates; as a result, they were controlled to check any pre-existing differences between the two groups.

ANCOVA offers a statistical method for adjusting the pre-test marks as covariates for any post-test differences (Dörnyei, 2007). Johnson and Christensen (2004) argue that in comparison with analysis of variance (ANOVA), ANCOVA offers more accurate results, since by using ANCOVA, the initial group differences would be diminished by controlling the pre-tests as the covariates. The covariates refer to certain group differences that are related to the dependent variable. In this study, the covariates referred to the pre-test differences between the two groups which were controlled using ANCOVA.

# 4.5.2.  Qualitative analysis

4.5.2.1.  Language-related episodes.  Following Lantolf (2000), microgenetic method was adopted to analyse the transcribed peer writing mediations among the EFL students in both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups on the three areas of writing content, writing organisation, and language use. According to Lantolf (2000), microgenetic method tracks students’ moment-to-moment language-related episodes (LREs) when involved in collaborative learning activities with other peers. LREs are ‘any part of a dialogue where students talk about the language they are producing, question their language use, or peer- or self-correct the language production’ (Swain, 2001, p. 287). In this study, the EFL students’ momentto-moment comments, editing, and revisions on the collaborative writing tasks (i.e. their LREs) were tracked in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups to reveal their microgenetic development in writing. This could showcase how the students’ reliance on peer writing mediations changed from other-regulation to self-regulation (see, for example, Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994). Following Creswell and Miller (2000), another expert EFL researcher checked the EFL students’ LREs and the uncovered mediations to ensure the credibility of the emerged peer writing mediations; any discrepancies were discussed and resolved.

The distribution of the generated peer writing mediations related to writing content, writing organisation, and language use were also counted and compared in both groups. Pearson Chi-square analysis was run to check the differences between the two groups’ peer writing mediation distributions regarding writing content, writing organisation, and language use categories.

4.5.2.2.  Thematic analysis.  To analyse the semi-structured interview data, a thematic analysis (Boyatzis, 1998), following a reiterative and bottomup approach, was applied. To this aim, the transcribed interviews were first coded based on open thematic coding to recognise the main themes about the EFL students’ attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio instruction. Following axial coding, the identified themes were clustered based on their interrelationships. Finally, each cluster was labelled based on the generated codes within that cluster. The processes of open coding, axial coding, and labelling were subjected to interrater reliability (Gass & Mackey, 2000). To this aim, another expert EFL researcher examined the whole processes of open coding, axial coding, and labelling one more time and discussed any discrepancies with the researcher/instructor.

# 5.  Results

In the present study, a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach for both data collections and data analyses were adopted. In this section, the quantitative and qualitative findings are presented.

# 5.1.  The quantitative analysis

First, descriptive statistics was run to indicate the pre- and post-test mean scores in the EFL students’ writing performance, and writing content, writing organisation, and language use in both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups. The results are presented in Table 1.

As evident in Table 1, little differences were observed between the pre-test mean scores of both groups regarding their writing performance, and writing content, writing organisation, and language use. However, it is evident that there were some improvements in the post-test mean scores of both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups’ writing performance, and writing content, writing organisation, and language use.

One-way ANCOVA was applied to see if there were any significant differences between the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups’ improvements in writing performance, and writing content, writing organisation, and language use. First, ANCOVA, examining the two groups’ writing performance, showed that the changes in the writing performance of both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups were significant, indicating that the students’ writing performance was improved in both groups to a great extent. In addition, it was indicated that after controlling for the pre-test scores of writings as the covariates, there were significant differences between the two groups’ post-test scores in writing performance, signifying that the EFL students’ writing performance in the electronic writing portfolio group outperformed that of the conventional writing portfolio group $[ F ( 1 , \ 4 2 ) \ = \ 1 2 . 7 $ , $p \ < \ . 0 1$ , ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 2 3 ]$ .

One-way ANCOVA was also run to examine the differences between the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups in improving the EFL students’ writing content. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the two groups’ post-test marks of writing content, after controlling for the pre-test marks $[ F ( 1 , \ 4 2 ) \ = \ 3 8 . 1 2 ,$ $\textit { p } <$ .01, ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 2 4 ]$ . This indicates that the electronic writing portfolio group was more effective in improving the EFL students’ writing content than its conventional counterparts. One-way ANCOVA, examining the differences between the two groups’ writing organisation, also indicated that after controlling for the pre-test marks of writing organisation, there were significant differences between the two groups’ post-test marks of writing organisation $[ F ( 1 , \ 4 2 ) \ = \ 7 6 . 1 3$ , $\textit { p } < \ . 0 1$ , ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 3 0 ]$ , signifying that the electronic writing portfolio instruction was more effective in developing the EFL students’ writing organisation than the conventional writing portfolio instruction. One-way ANCOVA, investigating the differences between the two groups in developing the EFL students’ language use, further indicated that after controlling for the covariates, there were significant differences between the two groups’ post-test marks of language use $[ F ( 1 , \ 4 2 ) \ : = \ : 4 4 . 8 5$ , $p < . 0 1$ , ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 4 2 ]$ , confirming that the electronic writing portfolio instruction improved the EFL students’ language use more effectively than the conventional writing portfolio instruction.

# 5.2.  The qualitative analysis

Further to quantitative data collections and analyses, qualitative data collections and analyses were applied to clarify the quantitative findings. In the quantitative analysis, the electronic writing portfolio students outperformed the conventional writing portfolio students in writing performance, and writing content, writing organisation, and language use. As a result, qualitative data collections and analyses were run in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups to shed more light on the findings.

# 5.2.1.  Peer mediations

LRE, exploring the EFL students’ moment-to-moment peer writing mediations (writing comments, editing, and revisions) in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups, was adopted to track the students’ microgenetic development in writing. The peer writing mediations were checked against the students’ writing content, writing organisation, and language use (i.e. grammatical range and accuracy, lexicon, & writing mechanics). Table 2 demonstrates the generated peer writing mediations, along with their distributions, under the three main categories of writing content, writing organisation, and language use in both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups.

As shown in Table 2, four peer writing mediations were uncovered under the writing content category; only one peer writing mediation was uncovered under the writing organisation category; and 18 peer writing mediations were uncovered under the language use category. In addition, the four uncovered peer writing mediations under the writing content category appeared 92 times in the students’ collaborative writing activities in the electronic-based writing portfolio class and they appeared 52 times in the conventional writing portfolio class. Pearson Chi-square analysis indicated that the distributions of content-related peer writing mediation between the two classes were significantly different: electronic vs conventional writing portfolio classes: $\chi 2 = 5 4 . 3 4$ , $\operatorname { d f } \ = \ 1$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0$ . This signified that the students in the electronic writing portfolio class provided more content-related peer writing mediations while they were engaged in collaborative writing activities, which could be a reason behind the electronic students’ better writing performance in comparison with their conventional counterparts.

Table 2. G enerated peer writing mediations in the two groups, addressing writing content, writing organisation, and language use.   

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Distributions of peer writing mediations</td></tr><tr><td>Categories</td><td>Peer writing mediations</td><td>Electronic</td><td>Conventional</td></tr><tr><td>Writing content</td><td>Clarity of message</td><td>59</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5"></td><td>Topic development</td><td>19</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Relevance of message</td><td>10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Synthesis of information.</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>92</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Writing organisation Idea sequencing</td><td>16</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Language use</td><td>Total</td><td>16</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Word choice</td><td>68</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Singular/plural</td><td>35</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Articles</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Coordination</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tense</td><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Verb form</td><td>40</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Part of speech</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Subject/verb agreement</td><td>13</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Word order</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Prepositions</td><td>14</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Unnecessary word</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Punctuation</td><td>12</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Superlatives</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Active/passive</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Relative clauses</td><td>12</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Subordination</td><td>9</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Comma splice</td><td>11</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Spelling</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>278</td><td>153</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 2 also shows that idea sequencing, which was the only uncovered peer writing mediation under the writing organisation category, appeared 16 times in the students’ collaborative writing activities in the electronic writing portfolio group. However, idea sequencing appeared 9 times in the conventional writing portfolio group. Pearson Chi-square analysis, conducted to check the differences between the two groups in terms of the distributions of idea sequencing, indicated significant differences between the two groups: electronic vs conventional writing portfolio classes: $\chi 2 = 3 6 . 8 5$ , $\operatorname { d f } = 1$ , $p = . 0 0$ . This reveals that in comparison with the conventional students, the students in the electronic writing portfolio class provided more organisation-related peer writing mediations during their writing collaborations, which could also clarify the electronic students’ better writing performance.

Moreover, Table 2 indicates that the 18 uncovered peer writing mediations related to the language use category appeared 278 times in the students’ collaborative writing activities in the electronic class and they appeared 153 times in the conventional class. The differences between the two classes in terms of the distributions of language-related peer writing mediations, checked through Pearson Chi-square analysis, reached significance: electronic vs conventional writing portfolio classes: $\chi 2 = 1 0 2 . 7 4$ , $\operatorname { d f } = 1$ , $p = . 0 0$ . This corroborates that the electronic students also provided more language-related peer writing mediations during their collaborative writing activities which further confirmed the electronic students’ better writing performance than conventional students.

Although most of the peer writing mediations were correctly resolved in the electronic-based class, not all peer writing mediations were correctly addressed by the other peers, especially by the students in the conventional class. For example, the following two excerpts in Table 3 show how the students’ mediations of their peers’ writing content in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups, respectively, were resolved or unresolved by other peers.

As indicated in Table 3, Peer 1 only provided an implicit peer writing mediation for the other peer’s writing, and Peer 2 changed the writing content to address the ambiguity of the sentence. However, the other writing collaboration between the two peers revealed that an implicit peer writing mediation was not adequate for the other peer and they did not resolve the content-related writing issue.

Table 4 also indicates how the EFL students correctly resolved or neglected other peers’ mediations related to writing organisation issues in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups, respectively.

Table 3. P eer writing mediations for writing content.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Writing content Example</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Correctly resolved</td><td>Original text: Due to globalisation and communication among various nations, we like to see the importance of learning a foreign language..

Make it longer to support what is going to be discussed in the body. Peer 2: Umm, no, I think it is long enough and it mentions the blueprints clearly. Revised text: Peer 2 did not revise the paragraph.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 4 indicates that Peer 2 resolved the writing organisation issue after receiving an explicit peer writing mediation from Peer 1. However, the other writing collaboration showed that Peer 2 could not address the writing organisation issue after receiving an implicit peer writing mediation from Peer 1.

The following excerpts from the peers in Table 5 further revealed how the EFL students correctly resolved, incorrectly resolved, unresolved (neither of the learners could resolve the writing issue), or neglected other peers’ mediations of other language-related writing issues in the electronic writing portfolio group.

As evident in Table 5, one of the peers provided an explicit peer writing mediation (after providing some implicit peer writing mediations) and the other peer resolved the language-related writing issue based on the explicit mediation. On the other hand, the other writing excerpt indicated that upon receiving an explicit peer writing mediation, the other peer incorrectly resolved the writing issue. The other episode revealed that the peers were not able to identify the writing issue and they denied addressing the writing issue. The last excerpt also showed that an explicit peer writing mediation provided by one of the peers was neglected by the other peer; that is, they did not address the writing issue based on the peer writing mediation.

To further clarify the findings of the study, the correctly resolved, incorrectly resolved, unresolved, and neglected peer writing mediations were counted in both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups. Table 6 presents the number of such peer writing mediations in both groups.

Table 6 indicates that the correctly resolved peer writing mediations in the electronic writing portfolio group occurred more frequently than the conventional writing portfolio group, signifying that the electronic EFL students were more successful in addressing the peer writing mediations than the conventional students, and this substantially contributed to the electronic students’ writing performance in general and their writing content, writing organisation, and language use in particular.

Comparing the other peer writing mediations occurred in both groups, it is corroborated that the electronic students were more successful than their conventional counterparts in dealing with their peers’ writing mediations, which further highlighted the effectiveness of electronic writing portfolio instruction.

Tracking the students’ peer mediations of writing content, writing organisation, and language use in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups, it was indicated that some of the students needed more explicit peer writing mediations in order to revise their writings which signified their low level of ZPD. These students were more dependent on their peers’ regulations (other-regulation) to address their writing issues. The EFL students sometimes ignored their peers’ mediations or had partial response to their peers’ mediations. Such learners needed less implicit and more explicit peer mediations in order to address and revise their written texts which revealed that they were still reliant on other-regulations. However, some of the students addressed the other peers’ implicit mediations appropriately and revised their written texts accordingly which indicated their high level of ZPDs, and hence, their self-regulation in writing. As the electronic students addressed most of the peer writing mediations correctly, they improved their writing and achieved their self-regulation in writing sooner than their conventional counterparts.

Additionally, the students’ moment-to-moment peer writing mediations in the electronic writing portfolio group highlighted that the peer writing mediations occurred frequently between the students in the electronic writing portfolio group and the students’ writing mediation types rapidly changed from the most explicit peer mediations to the most implicit peer mediations which indicated the students’ highly efficient move from other-regulation to self-regulation of writing. The user-friendliness of the electronic writing portfolio course seemed to have provided a favourable condition for the EFL students to reach their high level of ZPDs and self-regulation of writing as swiftly as possible which is an indicator of the students’ further development in writing performance in the electronic writing portfolio group in comparison with the conventional writing portfolio group.

# 5.2.2.  Student perceptions

At the end of the course, the EFL students’ attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio instruction were explored through an individual semi-structured interview to further clarify the findings. It was due to the fact that the electronic students outperformed the conventional students in writing performance in the quantitative and peer-writing-mediation sections of the study so that an individual semi-structured interview was conducted with some participants in the electronic writing portfolio class in order to shed more light on the findings of the study. The transcribed interviews were checked through thematic analysis and a number of themes and categories were emerged addressing the EFL students’ positive and negative perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio course.

5.2.2.1.  Positive student perceptions.  The students, experiencing the electronic writing portfolio course, highlighted a number of positive points which could be also supportive of the quantitative and peer-writing-mediation findings of the study. Table 7 summarises the emerged themes and categories along with an exemplary quote for each theme.

Table 7. E merged themes and categories, addressing the electronic students’ positive attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio.

S3: The instructor could send us visual files or supplementary material that were helpful for our writing development.</td></tr></table></body></html>

As revealed in Table 7, three categories and 10 themes were emerged addressing the EFL students’ positive attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio course. The EFL students, for instance, highlighted that the electronic writing portfolio contributed to their writing content, like helping the students get familiar with writing paragraphs appropriately. The participants also emphasised the role of the electronic writing portfolio in helping their writing organisation, such as the cohesion and coherence of their writing paragraphs. The students’ particular attention to language-related issues of their collaborative writing processes in the electronic writing portfolio was further emphasised through the individual interviews. This means that the online affordances helped the EFL students provide more relevant peer writing mediations for improving their writing performance in the three areas of writing content, writing organisation, and language use.

The electronic writing portfolio also provided a lot of engaging out-ofclass activities for the EFL students to improve their writing performance. The abundant peer feedback provided through the electronic writing portfolio course also engaged the students in further collaborative writing activities. They argued that the electronic writing portfolio even contributed to their individual writing skills, while they were engaged in collaborative writing activities. This can highlight that electronic writing portfolio facilitates in- and out-of-class collaborative and also individual writing activities.

The students also emphasised the online platform convenience and ease of use with writing portfolio. They reported that the electronic writing portfolio helped them track their writing development, since their writing assignments were saved in the electronic environment. In addition, the participants highlighted the user-friendliness of the electronic writing portfolio in helping them with their writing tasks. They referred to the immediate accessibility of the online platform in different places and different times. They reported that they checked and rechecked the online material and writing tasks wherever and whenever they thought was convenient for them. The participating EFL students also pointed out that the electronic writing portfolio course provided a favourable condition for them to be in touch with the researcher/instructor conveniently. This communication between the students and the researcher/instructor further helped the researcher/instructor provide the students with more electronic supplementary material.

Generally, based on the above-mentioned results of the individual semi-structured interview, the electronic writing portfolio made writing important, easier, and engaging for the EFL students and helped them improve their writing performance by using different affordances of the online environment.

5.2.2.2.  Negative student perceptions.  It also needs to be noted that the EFL students raised a number of issues with the electronic writing portfolio. The emerged themes and categories along with an exemplary quote for each theme are presented in Table 8.

Table 8 indicated that two categories and six themes were emerged addressing negative attitudes and perceptions of some EFL students towards the electronic-based writing portfolio course. The students mostly addressed the issue of working with other peers which they thought were frustrating, and they mostly preferred the researcher/ instructor contributions. The students’ negative attitudes and perceptions would sometimes originate from their poor writing performance which frustrated the students when they saw the other peers highlighted their writing issues. In a similar line, the students’ writing anxiety caused their negative attitudes and perceptions towards the collaborative writing activities online. This indicated that a part of the students’ negative attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio originated from their poor writing abilities which affected their performance in the electronic writing environment.

Table 8. E merged themes and categories, addressing the electronic students’ negative attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio.

Some of the students also had negative attitudes and perceptions towards some affordances of the online platform, like uploading and downloading some electronic files. As they did not have enough experience about online classes, they sometimes highlighted the difficulties of such instructional procedures. Finally, the students highlighted the problems with the low-speed Internet connections which made the electronic writing portfolio instructional procedures difficult to follow. Such negative attitudes and perceptions towards the electronic writing portfolio course could be related to the immediate context of the study which failed to provide the EFL students with online learning experiences.

In general, based on these negative attitudes and perceptions, sometimes, some of the students did not feel comfortable working with other peers and being taught online and they preferred teacher-centred and face-to-face instructions which were due to their lack of English proficiency or their desire to maintain the status quo and not change the processes of learning and teaching.

# 6.  Discussion

# 6.1.  The impact of electronic writing portfolio

Following Vygotsky’s social constructivism, the present study first examined the impact of electronic and conventional writing portfolios on

EFL students’ writing performance quantitatively. The results showed that both electronic and conventional writing portfolios developed the EFL students’ writing performance and the electronic writing portfolio outperformed the conventional writing portfolio in developing the EFL students’ writing performance. Barrot (2016, 2021) and Mills and Chandra (2011) showed the positive impact of electronic writing portfolio on writing performance of EFL students, the results which support the findings of the present study. According to Yeh et  al. (2011), technology-based collaborative writing contributes to students’ systematic, dynamic, and rhetorical engagement in English language writing. For instance, students can be motivated to accomplish collaborative writing tasks, have comments and give feedback, edit the writing tasks, create collaborative agendas and plans, participate in collaborative brainstorming activities, make collaborative writing outlines, and co-construct their writing tasks in technology-based environments. It could thus be argued that the online platform in the current study provided adequate options for the electronic portfolio students to accomplish their collaborative writing tasks more effectively.

The findings of the study might be due to the nature of the students’ collaborative writing activities in the electronic writing portfolio group. Following Vygotsky’s (1984) social constructivism, the online environment provided a user-friendly condition for the students to provide and receive peer writing mediations appropriately and improve their writing performance effectively. Different peers contributed to the collaborative writing tasks while using different affordances of the online platform, such as accessing related electronic materials, websites, videos, and other accomplished collaborative writing assignments. Moreover, the students edited and had comments on the writing tasks asynchronously; that is, wherever and whenever they thought was appropriate, which prepared the students for better peer writing mediations. Consistent with such findings, Lam et  al. (2018) claim that online platforms help EFL learners do the writing tasks collectively with other peers and have more peer feedback on the writing tasks. In agreement with the findings of the present study, Lam et  al. (2018) also argue that EFL learners are not restricted by time and place to check and address the peer writing feedback.

Such availability feature of the electronic platform increased not only student-student interactions, but also student-instructor interactions both in and outside the class, paving the way for extended collaborative writing activities in the electronic environment. In addition, since peer writing mediations and the researcher/instructor’s instructions and explanations were recorded on the online platform in text-based mode, the students had access to the peer writing mediations and other writing explanations for future reflections and references. The students’ writing drafts were stored in specific folders in the platform and they reviewed the writing drafts before starting their collaborative writing tasks. Due to such affordances, the EFL students in the electronic class became more engaged in the collaborative writing tasks in comparison with those in the conventional class. Charoenwet and Christensen (2016), in this regard, argue that an online environment encourages students’ participation and collaboration with other peers.

Supporting the above-mentioned findings, the students’ peer writing mediations in the electronic writing portfolio group were first provided implicitly, as revealed in the qualitative findings of the study; however, these types of writing mediations would have changed to explicit peer writing mediations if the peers had needed more help. The students relied less on explicit writing mediations during the later stages of the course which led to their self-regulation. Being consistent with Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994) microgenetic development (i.e. moving from other-regulation to self-regulation), the online context played a central role in this regard, since it helped the EFL students provide an abundant peer writing mediations on the collaborative writing tasks in three areas of writing content, writing organisation, and language use in a favourable electronic environment (as was confirmed by the distributions of peer writing mediations). Therefore, the electronic writing portfolio course, as supported by Aljaafreh and Lantolf ’s (1994) claim, helped the EFL students reach their ZPDs and self-regulation of writing (i.e. they moved from other-regulation to self-regulation in writing). In a similar vein, Teng (2021) argues that technologies help EFL students provide and receive more effective writing mediations, which subsequently, develop students’ writing performance to a great extent. According to Rahimi and Fathi (2021), an important element of peer writing mediations is to help EFL students internalise their writing skills. This indicates that by providing and receiving peer writing mediations during collaborative writing activities, students can gradually internalise the required writing skills and act autonomously. The online platform in the present study helped the EFL students gradually become more responsible for their writing tasks, since they could internalise the required writing skills during the collaborative writing activities by applying different affordances of the electronic writing portfolio.

However, because of the restricted time in the conventional writing portfolio class, there was not sufficient time for student-student and instructor-student interactions when discussing, editing, and revising the required writing tasks. Despite the students in the electronic writing portfolio class who had access to their writing tasks anywhere and anytime, the students in the conventional writing portfolio class did not have access to their writing drafts anywhere and anytime. The ubiquitous nature of the online platform in the electronic writing portfolio group enabled the students to check their writing tasks wherever and whenever they liked and even have more extended discussions with their peers and the researcher/instructor online. In the conventional writing portfolio group, the interactive activities between the students and their peers and the researcher/instructor and students only occurred orally, whilst in the electronic writing portfolio class the student-student and researcher/ instructor-student interactions occurred not only orally, but also in text-based mode, which made the recorded files available for future reflections and references.

# 6.2.  Student perceptions of electronic writing portfolio

As in Mills and Chandra’s (2011) study, the students’ appreciations of the collaborative writing activities in the electronic writing portfolio environment motivated the students to further peer mediate the other peer’s written texts and develop their writing performance. On the other hand, the EFL students, possessing various writing abilities, contributed differently to the writing tasks to co-construct their writing skills and achieve their ZPDs, as corroborated by Donato (2004) and Neumann and McDonough (2015). The interview findings also supported the aforementioned quantitative findings in which the EFL students expressed their positive attitudes and perceptions towards the prominent role of different affordances of the electronic environment in improving their writing performance. Krutka et  al. (2014) in this regard, argue that electronic environments foster students’ satisfaction and interactions. Kongchan (2008) also claims that social learning networks are perceived to be wonderful platforms for both instructors and students. The interview part of the study also highlighted that the less capable peers became more engaged in the collaborative writing activities in the later stages of the electronic writing portfolio course which were due to the other peers’ provision of writing self-regulatory strategies during the collaborative writing activities.

As revealed in the qualitative part of the study, the EFL students’ writing performance, which was in three areas of writing content, writing organisation, and language use, were due to other factors, like writing portfolio, which the students believed was facilitated through the electronic affordances. As the students thought, the electronic writing portfolio developed their independent writing performance, such as writing self-correction and writing self-evaluation. Following Hamp-Lyons and Condon (2000), the students in this study, conveniently collected and tracked the written texts and reflected on different parts of the written texts for self-evaluation and self-regulation purposes which subsequently helped them enhance their writing performance in the electronic environment.

Moreover, as the students claimed, they had access to the collaboratively written texts anywhere and anytime. As a model, they used the written texts that they were most satisfied with and accomplished the subsequent writing tasks in the electronic environment. These findings are in line with those of Lam et  al. (2018) who claim that EFL learners can have access to the writing samples online and they can check the written texts whenever they think is appropriate. According to Trust (2017), students and instructors can create different folders for storing different collaborative tasks on electronic platforms, like Edmodo environment, for future references. Related resources can be also uploaded within the related folders to contribute to students’ collaborative tasks. Trust (2017) believes that instructors and students can track their improvements based on their previous tasks in the related folders online. The availability of the previous writings, in this study, gave the students some helpful hints to frequently mediate the other peers’ subsequent writing tasks in the electronic environment. Such peer writing mediations helped the EFL students reach their potential level of functioning by decreasing reliance on peer writing mediations and gradually gaining self-regulation or automatisation in writing (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994).

# 7.  Conclusion

By collecting and analysing the required data through a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach, the present study indicated positive roles of electronic writing portfolio in developing the EFL students’ writing performance. The findings imply that EFL students can engage in portfolio-based collaborative writing activities on electronic environments to provide and receive peer writing mediations and improve their writing performance. EFL students can gather and track the writing drafts using online space, reflect on the writing drafts, and select the best writing drafts as models for subsequent collaborative writing activities. The findings can also help EFL teachers conduct an electronic writing portfolio course and contribute to EFL students’ writing performance.

Despite the implications of the study, there were some limitations that may encourage researchers to conduct further research. For example, the findings of the current study need to be generalised with caution, since the sample size included only 23 and 22 EFL undergraduate students in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups, respectively, which is still small for quantitative analyses. Thus, EFL researchers are encouraged to replicate the study and recruit a large sample of EFL undergraduate students in order to generalise the findings more confidently. Furthermore, we did not check the EFL students’ attitudes and perceptions towards the conventional writing portfolio course. The reason was that we adopted a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach to collect and analyse the required data. To this aim, we carried out further qualitative data collections and analyses (i.e. individual semi-structured interviews) with the group that outperformed the other group in writing performance, and writing content, writing organisation, and language use (i.e. the electronic writing portfolio group) following the quantitative and peer-writing-mediation findings. However, conducting individual semi-structured interviews with the less effective group (in this study, the conventional writing portfolio group) and comparing the findings with those of the electronic writing portfolio group, may yield further insight into how EFL students perceive the two instructional procedures. Therefore, other EFL researchers are recommended to replicate the present study and explore both electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups’ attitudes and perceptions towards the the electronic and coventional courses to check the similarities and differences. Moreover, if the interviews be conducted at different stages of the courses (e.g. at the beginning, middle, and end of the courses), the findings might shed more light on the literature.

In addition, this study just took one term (i.e. 12 90-minute sessions) to explore the EFL students’ writing performance in the electronic and conventional writing portfolio groups which might not be a sufficient time to explore all the details. EFL researchers are suggested to explore the same factors in a longer period of time to more deeply and extensively explore various factors involved in EFL students’ writing performance in electronic and conventional writing portfolio courses. Additionally, the researcher/instructor conducted both electronic and conventional writing portfolio classes in the current study, whilst two different instructors and more than two classes could have been recruited to control the researcher/instructor’s possible biased influence on the electronic writing portfolio group’s better writing performance on the one hand, and enhance the internal validity of the study on the other hand. Finally, EFL researchers can explore the impact of electronic writing portfolio on other writing skills and strategies to further investigate its plausible effects.
