The present study explored the development of writing performance and discourse organization in Chinese as a second language (L2) writing, focusing on the effects of genre and learning context. Tracking an L2 Chinese learner’s written production in two genres (i.e., narrative and argumentative) across four learning contexts (i.e., pre-study abroad, study abroad, post-study abroad, and delayed post-study abroad) longitudinally over four years, this study revealed that holistic ratings and discourse organizational devices showed distinct patterns in different genres and across learning contexts. Narrative essays generally received lower ratings than argumen tative essays. Ratings of narrative essays remained relatively stable across four learning contexts, whereas those of argumentative essays displayed an omega-shaped pattern over the four-year period. Among six discourse organizational devices, subordinate clauses, textual connectives, and grammatical metaphors were used more in argumentative essays, but coordinate clauses and topic-prominent constructions were used more in narrative essays. The six discourse organiza tional devices exhibited discrete developmental trends throughout the four years of learning. This study provides a deeper understanding of writing performance and discourse organization in L2 Chinese development.

# 1. Introduction

Second language (L2) writing is a cognitively complex, socially situated process that requires L2 learners to construct meaning by using language in particular ways according to writing tasks and topics (Biber et al., 2016; Johns et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2015). This aligns with a fundamental principle of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) that language use is genre-based (Halliday, 1985; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014). Different genres have distinct conventional patterns that learners must master to write effectively in an L2. Despite a few L2 English studies investigating how writing performance indices or specific lexico-grammatical patterns vary according to genres (e.g., Staples & Reppen, 2016; Yoon & Polio, 2017), the genre effect on L2 writing has yet to be widely examined (Ortega, 2015).

During the writing process, L2 learners need to make decisions about how they should present information flow to produce cohesive and coherent discourse. Developing such discourse competence may require a substantial amount of input over extended periods or explicit instruction, given that discourse organizational devices tend to be less salient and more nuanced than other grammatical features (Sorace, 2011). Theories that emphasize the roles of input and noticing, such as usage-based theories, input processing theory, and the cognitive-interactionist approach to L2 acquisition, regard study abroad (SA) as an ideal environment for enhancing L2 writing abilities and discourse competence. This is because SA is believed to provide ample opportunities for learners to implicitly learn discourse organizational devices through authentic discourse input in various genres outside the classroom or to explicitly learn these subtle discourse organizational devices through explicit instruction if the SA program offers a formal writing class (Vallejos & Sanz, 2021). However, very few SA studies have been conducted to examine the development of discourse organizational devices in L2 writing (Vallejos & Sanz, 2021).

Of particular paucity are studies exploring the effects of genre and learning context on writing performance and discourse orga nization in a less commonly taught language, such as Chinese. Chinese presents unique challenges in writing and discourse organi zation for L2 learners due to various linguistic and cognitive factors, including the logographic writing system, topic-oriented discourse features, and first language (L1) influence. Therefore, research on L2 Chinese writing can provide more profound insights into L2 writing development. In addition, capturing the long-term development of writing performance and discourse organization influenced by genre and learning context is particularly informative for L2 Chinese writing instruction and assessment, which necessitates a longitudinal research design (Norris & Ortega, 2009; Ortega, 2003; Vallejos & Sanz, 2021). Thus, this study aims to fill the gaps in the current literature by exploring the effects of genre and learning context on an L2 Chinese learner’s development of writing perfor mance and discourse organization over a four-year period.

# 2. Genre and contextual effects on L2 writing

The effect of genre on the use of linguistic constructions has primarily been investigated in L2 English. Studies have shown that L2 English writers generally use longer clauses and sentences as well as more coordinate phrases and complex noun phrases in argu mentative essays, in comparison to narrative and expository essays (Lu, 2011; Staples & Reppen, 2016; Yoon & Polio, 2017). In addition, argumentative essays have been found to elicit more subordinate clauses (Lu, 2011), particularly conditional adverbial clauses (i.e., $i f .$ -clause; Staples & Reppen, 2016). However, Yoon and Polio (2017) reported no genre effect of argumentative and narrative writings on the use of subordination and coordination by L2 English learners. Similarly, other studies revealed common lexico-grammatical patterns across genres, such as various lexical and syntactic complexity indices, suggesting certain core mecha nisms underlying L2 writing products in different genres (Zhang & Lu, 2022; Zhang et al., 2022).

Two explanations have been proposed for the higher level of linguistic complexity observed in argumentative writing. One explanation is based on the Cognition Hypothesis (Robinson, 2003), which predicts that argumentative writing involves more eval uation, reasoning, and argumentation, thus necessitating higher cognitive demands and eliciting a higher degree of linguistic complexity (e.g., Staples & Reppen, 2016). The other is grounded in SFL: the communicative and functional differences between genres give rise to different language use (Halliday, 1985; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014). In support of argumentation, argumentative essays often employ complex noun phrases that encode more lexical information than simple nouns, as well as adverbial subordinate clauses that establish complex inter-clausal relationships instead of verb/noun complement clauses (Staples & Reppen, 2016; Yoon & Polio, 2017).

Findings of the SA effect on L2 writing development have been largely inconclusive (Vallejos & Sanz, 2021). Some studies reported significant improvements in L2 writing abilities over SA (e.g., Godfrey et al., 2014; Sasaki, 2007; Zaytseva et al., 2022), whereas other studies revealed no gains (e.g., Llanes & Munoz, ˜ 2013). The length of SA seemed to play a critical role in L2 writing proficiency gains (Sasaki, 2011; Xu, 2019), given that some measures of writing performance (e.g., accuracy, lexical richness, and syntactic complexity) did not show significant improvements until the end of one-year SA (Serrano et al., 2012). However, other studies demonstrated that after one semester of SA, learners were able to improve their use of cohesive devices and referencing systems and produce more coherent content, better argument structure, and more appropriate writing style (Godfrey et al., 2014; Storch, 2009; Whittaker et al., 2011). This may be attributed to the differential effects of SA on different aspects of language use. Writing fluency, lexical accuracy, and lexical diversity generally showed greater improvement SA than grammar during SA (Godfrey et al., 2014; P´erez-Vidal & Juan-Garau, 2009; Sasaki, 2007; Serrano et al., 2011; Zaytseva et al., 2022).

Despite the discrepancies in the findings, L2 writing research has demonstrated that the benefits of SA may diminish over time. For instance, P´erez-Vidal and Juan-Garau’s (2009) study discovered that L2 English writers failed to maintain their gains and even experienced losses in writing fluency, lexical accuracy, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity (i.e., increased use of coordinate clauses) in 15 months after returning from a three-month SA program. This longitudinal research may shed light on the effect of SA on the progression and regression of L2 writing performance and certain linguistic constructions. Notwithstanding the fruitful findings of the genre and contextual effects in L2 English writing, such investigation on L2 Chinese writing performance and discourse organization is currently lacking, especially using a longitudinal research design.

# 3. Chinese discourse organization

Discourse organization is generally characterized by two interrelated concepts: cohesion and coherence. Cohesion refers to the lexical and grammatical linking utilized to connect propositions within a text to create a comprehensible text. Coherence pertains to the degree to which the connected propositions within the text can be effectively understood by the reader (Crossley et al., 2016a, 2016b). In this respect, cohesion reflects the writer’s intentional use of linguistic devices to form a cohesive text that is intended to be perceived as coherent by the reader. According to Crossley et al. (2016a, 2016b), cohesive devices can be categorized into three levels: local (i.e., devices between clauses or sentences, such as connectives), global (i.e., devices between paragraphs or larger text units), and overall text (i.e., devices across the text, such as information flow, referential system, and lexical repetition).

Chinese discourse features many unique cohesive devices at all three levels. Unlike English, which is a subject-prominent language and typically constructs discourse upon sentences containing a subject and predicate, Chinese organizes discourse around the state ment of a topic and its comments. The comments describe the topic that represents the information being discussed (Li & Thompson, 1981; Sun, 2006). Chinese highlights several topic-prominent constructions (TPs), some of which are idiosyncratic in their form and function (Sun, 2006). The most representative topic-prominent construction is the topic–comment sentence. As sentence 1 illustrates, the topic (这家餐馆 zh\`e jia ¯ cangu ¯ ǎn) occupies the sentence-initial position, followed by a comment that contains a subject–predicate clause (中国菜很地道 zhonggu ¯ o ´ cai \` hˇen dìdao) to elaborate on the topic. The topic–comment sentence appears to have two subjects and is also referred to as the double-subject construction (Li & Thompson, 1981).

1.这家餐馆中国菜很地道。 Zh\`e jia ¯ cangu ¯ ǎn zhonggu ¯ o ´ cai \` hˇen dìdao。 this restaurant Chinese dish very authentic Chinese dishes in this restaurant are very authentic.

Despite the so-called canonical SVO word order in Chinese, an object in a sentence can be moved to the sentence-initial position as a topic, yielding an OSV word order, as shown in sentence 2.

2.中国电影我喜欢看。 Zhonggu ¯ o ´ di\`anyǐng wǒ xǐhuan kan\` 。 Chinese movie I like watch I like watching Chinese movies.

An object can also be topicalized in the Ba-construction (see sentence 3). Syntactically, $B a$ -construction requires a preverbal object following the preposition Ba and a verbal complement that specifies the effect of affectedness or disposal of the object caused by the verb. Semantically, the verb in a Ba-construction must possess the properties of transitivity and telicity to convey the result, change, and completion imposed on the preverbal object (Liu, 1997; Sun, 2006). Because of its syntactic position and the semantic emphasis placed on it, the preverbal object is also considered a secondary topic (Chu, 1998).

3. 我把书放到书架上。 Wǒ bǎ shu ¯ fang \` d\`ao shuji ¯ a \` shang \` 。 I Ba book put bookshelf above I put the book on the bookshelf.

In existential sentences, a noun phrase expressing location can be topicalized in the subject position and is commonly followed by verbs 有 yǒu (have) and 是 shì (is) to indicate that the object fills the location. The locative noun phrase is also usually followed by action verbs, such as 挂 gua \` (hang), to emphasize the durative state of the object in the location (see sentence 4).

4. 教室墙上挂着一幅画。 Ji\`aoshì qiang ´ sh\`ang gu\`a zhe y¯ı fù hua\`。 classroom wall above hang one painting A painting is hanging on the wall in a classroom.

Additionally, Chinese discourse tends to rely more on parataxis than English discourse. In other words, Chinese discourse utilizes more coordinate clauses (CCs) as opposed to subordinate clauses (SCs). Textual connectives (TCs) are often optional or unnecessary to mark paratactic relations in Chinese, while hypotactic relations usually need to be signaled by TCs in English (Li & Yu, 2021; Tse, 2010). In Chinese discourse, topic can extend its semantic domain over multiple clauses, which allows multiple CCs with a shared topic to form a topic chain (Li, 2004). In a topic chain (see sentence 5), the shared topic usually appears at the beginning of the first clause and is omitted in the subsequent clauses. Unlike English, Chinese is a pro-drop language, which allows for null subjects (NSs) if they can be pragmatically or grammatically inferred from the context. The clauses within a topic chain are threaded through the shared topic and paratactic relationship, rather than TCs (Li, 2004).

5. 那家餐馆离学校不远， $\varnothing$ 比较便宜， $\varnothing$ 有几个拿手菜不错， $\varnothing$ 值得推荐。 Na \` ji¯a c¯anguǎn lí xu´exiao \` bùyuǎn, $\varnothing$ bǐjiao \` pianyi,´ $\varnothing$ yǒu jǐ ge nash ´ ǒu cai \` bú cuo,\` $\varnothing$ zhíd´e tu¯ıjian\` 。 that restaurant from school not far, comparatively cheap, have several specialty not bad, worth recommend That restaurant is not far away from the school, relatively cheap, and has several specialties. It is worth recommending.

Grammatical metaphor (GM) refers to the incongruent realization of a given semantic configuration in the lexico-grammar (Halliday, 1985; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014). For instance, when a causal relationship is expressed by a cause-and-effect complex sentence, possibly marked by causal connectives such as 因为 y¯ınw\`ei (because/since), it is a congruent realization (see sentence 6). However, when a causal relationship is not conveyed by a cause-and-effect complex sentence, but rather by causative verbs such as 导 致 dǎozhì (lead to/cause) in a simple sentence, it is an incongruent realization (i.e., GM; see sentence 7).

6. 因为学生数量减少了，所以学费增长了。 Y¯ınw\`ei xu´esheng shùli\`ang jiǎnshǎo le, suǒyǐ xu´ef\`ei z¯engzhǎng le。 because student quantity decrease, so tuition increase

Because the number of students decreased, the tuition increased.

7. 学生的减少导致了学费的增长。 Xu´esheng de jiǎnshǎo dǎozhì le xu´ef\`ei de z¯engzhǎng. student decrease cause tuition increase The decrease in students caused the increase in tuition.

In addition to the condensation of causal relationship in a complex sentence into a causative verb, GM occurs when an event or action is incongruently realized by a noun phrase rather than a verb phrase. The events 学生数量减少 xu´esheng shùliang \` jiǎnshǎo (the number of students decreased) and 学费增长 xu´ef\`ei z¯engzhǎng (the tuition increased) in sentence 6 are encoded in noun phrases 学生的减少 xu´esh¯eng de jiǎnshǎo (the decrease in students) and 学费的增长 xu´ef\`ei de z¯engzhǎng (the increase in tuition) in sentence 7, respectively, instantiating two GMs. As a discourse organizational device, these nominalization-based GMs help enhance discourse cohesion through lexical repetition and make the discourse more lexically condensed (see sentence 8). In sum, TPs, NSs, TCs, SCs, CCs, and GMs permeate all three levels of cohesion, reflecting the distinctive nature and characteristics of Chinese discourse organization. Consequently, in the present study, L2 learners’ ability to organize Chinese discourse is operationalized as the use of these discourse organizational devices.

8. 学生数量一直在减少，… 学生的减少导致了学费的增长。

Xu´esheng shùliang \` y¯ızhí z\`ai jiǎnshǎo, … xu´esheng de jiǎnshǎo dǎozhì le xu´ef\`ei de z¯engzhǎng。 student quantity constantly decrease, … student decrease cause tuition increase The number of students is constantly decreasing, … the decrease in students has caused the increase in tuition.

# 4. Discourse organization in L2 Chinese writing

Studies of L2 Chinese writing have examined how learners at various proficiency levels use these discourse organizational devices. Utilizing various data collection methods, such as oral interviews, storytelling tasks, translation tasks, free compositions, and picturecued writing tasks, several studies consistently showed that English-speaking learners underused TPs (e.g., topic–comment sentences, existential sentences, and Ba-constructions) in comparison to native norms but used TPs increasingly more as they became more proficient (Jin, 1994; Wen, 1994, 2010; Xiao, 2004). In particular, this trend was corroborated in the use of topic chains and NSs in L2 Chinese writing (Hu et al., 2022; Jin, 2007; Lu & Wu, 2022).

Corpus-based studies examining the use and development of TCs in L2 Chinese found that English-speaking learners mainly relied on a narrow range of frequently used TCs, such as 但是 danshi ̀  (but), 因为 yi‾nwei ̀ (because), and 所以 suoyi ̌  (so), and tended to overuse these TCs in their written production (Cao, 2013; Yang, 2013). Specifically, Liao’s (2020) study examined the relationship between the quality of writing and the use of additive, contrastive, causative, and conditional connectives in descriptive essays written by English learners of Chinese. Among these connectives, only conditional connectives appeared more frequently in high-quality essays, and the misuse of these connectives decreased as the writing quality improved.

SCs and CCs have commonly been utilized as indices of writing development and performance in L2 research. Based on SFL, Norris and Ortega (2009) proposed distinct stages of syntactic complexification along L2 development: coordination is employed at the beginning level, subordination at the intermediate level, and phrasal elaboration at the advanced level. However, empirical studies have yielded conflicting evidence. In support of this proposal, some studies demonstrated that L2 learners’ use of subordination increased with their proficiency growth, and coordination decreased or showed no change toward higher proficiency levels (Barrot & Agdeppa, 2021; Khushik & Huhta, 2020; Kisselev et al., 2022; Verspoor et al., 2012). However, other studies rejected this proposal by revealing that the use of coordination positively correlated with learners’ proficiency, and subordination showed a negative or no relationship with proficiency (Bult´e & Housen, 2014; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Lu, 2011). In L2 Chinese writing, Jin (2007) revealed that CCs exhibited a linear growth pattern as English-speaking learners of Chinese became more proficient, while the use of SCs did not show significant differences between different proficiency levels.

As SFL claims, GMs are employed as a primary lexico-grammatical resource for constructing more advanced, more objective/ impersonal discourse, particularly in argumentative and explanatory writings (Halliday, 1985; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014). L2 German learners with relatively higher proficiency levels tended to use GMs more frequently in argumentative essays than in narrative essays, showing the awareness of discourse functions of GMs in relation to genre (Byrnes, 2009). Similarly, L2 English learners’ use of GMs became more frequent and more sophisticated with increased proficiency, indicating a better control of GMs as a tool for discourse organization (Liard´et, 2013, 2015, 2016).

Based on L1 Chinese corpus data, Yang (2011) reported that GMs were used more frequently in explanatory/expository texts than in reports and in university textbooks than in secondary school textbooks. The nominalization of verbs was found to be the most commonly employed type of GMs in Chinese (Yang, 2011). It is assumed that producing GMs is less syntactically challenging in Chinese than in English, because the nominalization of verb phrases in Chinese requires no change in word order or morphological variation to mark lexical categories as in English (Yang, 2008, 2011). However, contrastive analyses indicated that English discourse utilized GMs more frequently than Chinese discourse (Yang, 2008, 2011). Moreover, Pan’s (2023) research documented sporadic use of GMs in narrative and expository essays written by L2 Chinese learners at different instructional levels. Despite the existing findings on these discourse organizational devices, they remain under-researched in L2 Chinese writing. Furthermore, little is known about the effects of genre and learning context on their development.

# 5. The present study

The present study aims to fill several gaps in the current literature. Firstly, despite extensive L2 Chinese research investigating discourse organization devices individually, a detailed investigation of these devices collectively across different genres and multiple learning contexts is warranted. Secondly, existing L2 Chinese writing research primarily adopts a cross-sectional design, leaving some key questions unanswered about the developmental trajectories of writing performance and discourse organization. A longitudinal approach enables researchers to track the development over time and aids time-wise analyses of trends. Thirdly, L2 writing research on this topic has mainly focused on Indo-European languages; however, research on Chinese is conducive to a better understanding of genre, learning context, writing performance, and discourse organization in L2 development. Thus, this study investigates an L2 Chinese learner’s writing performance and discourse organization in two genres across four learning contexts over a period of four years. Specifically, two research questions are formulated:

1. What are the effects of genre on writing performance and discourse organization in L2 Chinese?   
2. What are the effects of learning context on writing performance and discourse organization in L2 Chinese?

# 5.1. Method

# 5.1.1. Participant

When the study began in fall 2017, the participant (pseudonym: Henry) was a 20-year-old European-American male in his sophomore year, double majoring in electrical engineering and Chinese language and literature at a public university in the Mid western United States. Henry spoke English as his native language and did not have any exposure to Chinese or receive any instruction in Chinese until the summer prior to college. During the summer of 2016, he began to learn Chinese in a one-month intensive Chinese language program in the United States. He enrolled in the first- and second-year Chinese courses at the home institution in the 2016–2018 academic years. In the 2018–2019 academic year, he studied abroad at a Chinese university in Northeast China. After this one-year SA, he took the fourth-year Chinese course at the home institution in the 2019–2020 academic year. Because of the one-year SA and his major requirements in electrical engineering, Henry needed a fifth year to complete his undergraduate study. After a onesemester interruption in fall 2020, he resumed Chinese learning by engaging in an advanced individual study session with a Chinese instructor in spring 2021. The study concluded when Henry graduated and landed an internship at a joint American–Chinese company in the United States in fall 2021.

# 5.1.2. Learning contexts

Throughout a four-year period of data collection from fall 2017 to fall 2021, Henry experienced four different learning contexts. (1) In the pre-SA context, he received L2 Chinese instruction in a formal classroom setting (i.e., second-year Chinese course), in which the classes met five times per week for approximately 50 minutes per class period. (2) In the SA context, he took intensive language classes (e.g., vocabulary, speaking, and reading) and culture courses for four hours on weekdays. Although no language class focused spe cifically on writing, assignments, emails to classmates and professor, and messages to friends were mostly written in Chinese. (3) In the post-SA context, he enrolled in the fourth-year Chinese course, which met twice a week for 75 minutes each time. This course did not include any specific instruction targeted at writing skills, but the course required students to write bi-weekly essays on topics related to the learning content in the classroom and to revise these essays according to the written feedback provided by the instructor. (4) In the delayed post-SA context, he met individually with an instructor to read passages or news articles in his major (i.e., electrical engineering) and those that piqued his interest in other fields (e.g., politics) and to discuss about the topics raised in the reading materials in one-hour weekly sessions.

# 5.2. Data collection

A total of 30 essays were collected at 15 half-semester intervals over the course of four years, excluding the 2020 Fall semester. At each data collection point, a pair of narrative and argumentative essays were administered with the genres alternated to diminish the practice and fatigue effects. In the first 11 data collection points, 22 essays were collected in 11 different pairs of narrative and argumentative writing tasks. The remaining 8 essays were collected using the last 4 pairs of narrative and argumentative writing tasks at data collection points 12–15 to investigate the delayed post-SA effect in comparison to the post-SA effect. No essay was collected between data collection points 11 and 12, when Henry did not take any Chinese course. The data collection timeline, writing tasks, and learning contexts are displayed in Table 1. For each writing task, Henry was given a maximum of 45 minutes to handwrite the essay in Chinese characters without external assistance. Henry was encouraged to write Chinese characters but allowed to use Pinyin (Romanized system for Mandarin Chinese) to substitute for any Chinese character that he did not know how to write, given that writing Chinese characters often poses challenges to L2 Chinese learners.

The narrative writing tasks required Henry to narrate a story based on the given pictures with details about the event, characters, time frames, and surroundings. The argumentative writing tasks required Henry to take a stance on a topic and explain the stance with evidence and reasoning. The essay topics were non-technical and closely related to American college students’ daily life experiences. The writing tasks within each genre were carefully designed and aligned in terms of topic familiarity, cognitive difficulty, and the format of writing prompts, by consulting with L2 Chinese writing experts and referring to the content of the textbooks used by Henry. Sample narrative and argumentative writing tasks are presented in Appendix A.

Henry’s demographic information was obtained from a survey completed before writing two essays at the first data collection point. Five interviews were conducted individually with Henry in English over the four-year data collection period, with the first interview at the end of spring 2018, the second at the beginning of fall 2018 (pre-SA), the third at the end of spring 2019 (post-SA), the fourth at the end of spring 2020, and the fifth at the end of spring 2021. The interviews were semi-structured to include certain themes, such as Henry’s learning experiences before and after SA, interactions with local people outside the SA program, insights on the development of language skills (including writing) and linguistic items in different learning contexts, perceptions of the writing tasks, and the topics that Henry initiated or piqued his interest. Each of the interviews lasted approximately 30–40 minutes.

# 5.3. Rating and coding

Writing performance on the 30 essays was holistically rated, using the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Writing Proficiency Guidelines (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 2012). The guidelines describe five major levels of proficiency: Distinguished, Superior, Advanced, Intermediate, and Novice. The major levels of Advanced, Intermediate, and Novice are further divided into three sublevels of High, Mid, and Low. The description of each major level specifies the tasks, content, context, accuracy, and discourse types that writers can handle at that level. The 30 essays were rated in a randomized order and independently by two raters, a certified rater of the ACTFL Writing Proficiency Test and a certified tester of the ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview. The two raters achieved an agreement rate of $7 0 \%$ (21/30) in their ratings. Six discrepancies were resolved by the discussion between the two raters. For the remaining three discrepancies, a third rater, an experienced researcher in L2 Chinese development who is a certified ACTFL trainer and very familiar with ACTFL Writing Proficiency Guidelines, was invited to evaluate the essays and resolve the remaining discrepancies through discussion.

In addition to the holistic ratings, the 30 essays were coded for six target discourse organizational devices: TPs, NSs, TCs, SCs, CCs, and GMs. TPs included five sub-constructions: topic–comment sentence, topic chain, existential sentence, prepositioned-object sen tence, and Ba-construction. TCs consisted of intra-sentential local connectives, such as 如果 rúguǒ (if) and 就 jiù (then), and intersentential global connectives, such as 最后 zuìhou \` (finally). The raw frequencies of six discourse organizational devices and the total number of clauses were tallied for each essay. In Chinese, a clause usually consists of a subject and a predicate but can come in various forms, given that the subject can be omitted if it can be inferred from the context, and the predicate can be a verb phrase, adjective phrase, or noun phrase (Li & Thompson, 1981; Sun, 2006). Thus, in this study, a clause was operationalized as “minimally consisting of a predicate of various forms” (Chu, 1998, p. 354).

Two coders independently coded the 30 essays and reached a high level of intercoder reliability (in Pearson correlation coefficients)

for the total numbers of TPs $( r = . 8 7$ , $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ ), NSs $( r = . 8 2$ , $p < . 0 0 1 \ r .$ ), TCs $( r = . 9 2$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ), SCs $( r = . 9 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ), CCs $( r = . 9 1$ , $p$ ${ < . 0 0 1 } \mathrm { \dot { \Omega } }$ ), GMs $( r = . 9 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1 \ r .$ ), and clauses $( r = . 9 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ) per essay. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion between the two coders. The measures of TPs, NSs, TCs, SCs, and CCs were further normalized by calculating their relative frequencies per clause in each essay. Due to the low frequency of GMs in the essays, the raw frequency and type of GMs were separately recorded. The measures of writing performance and discourse organizational devices are presented in Table 2.

# 5.4. Analysis

Means and standard deviations were calculated for the five measures of discourse organizational devices (i.e., TP/C, NS/C, TC/C, SC/C, and CC/C) in two genres and across four learning contexts. To better examine the effects of genre and learning context in a single-subject study, the effect size and its $9 5 ~ \%$ confidence interval were calculated for these measures between the genres and learning contexts (Olive & Smith, 2005). When comparing the means between the pre-SA context and three other contexts, Hedges’ g was used due to the unequal numbers of essays collected in these contexts; when comparing the means among the SA, post-SA, and delayed post-SA contexts, Cohen’s $d$ was used. Effect sizes were interpreted using the benchmarks of small $\stackrel { \cdot } { d } = 0 . 4 0 \stackrel { \cdot } { }$ ), medium $\ Q =$ 0.70), and large $\zeta d = 1 . 0 0 \AA$ ) in L2 research, as suggested by Plonsky and Oswald (2014). Boxplots were generated to visualize the developmental trends of these discourse organizational devices along the learning contexts. The means and total numbers of GMs were displayed for the two genres and four learning contexts to examine its association with the genre and learning context. All GMs were extracted from the participant’s writings to closely investigate its usage in L2 Chinese writing.

# 6. Results

# 6.1. Research question 1

Research question 1 investigates the effects of genre on writing performance ratings and discourse organizational devices. Table 3 displays the holistic ratings in the two genres and four learning contexts. As shown in Table 3, holistic ratings in argumentative essays were generally higher than those in narrative essays. This difference was particularly conspicuous in the SA and post-SA contexts. Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics of discourse organizational devices for genres. As shown in Table 4, NSs did not differ significantly between narrative and argumentative essays. TPs and CCs were used more frequently in narrative essays than in argumentative essays, whereas TCs and SCs were used more frequently in argumentative essays than in narrative essays. All the differences in TPs, CCs, TCs, and SCs showed large effect sizes. GMs were exclusively used in argumentative essays, with a total occurrence of 14 times.

# 6.2. Research question 2

Research question 2 examines the effects of learning context on writing performance ratings and discourse organizational devices.   
As shown in Table 3, holistic ratings in narrative essays remained at a relatively stable level around Intermediate-Mid throughout the   
four learning contexts. However, holistic ratings in argumentative essays exhibited an omega-shaped pattern. They initially started at   
Intermediate-Mid in the pre-SA context, then rose to Advanced-Mid during the SA context. This higher level was maintained until the   
early post-SA context, after which the ratings declined back to Intermediate-Mid for the rest of post-SA and delayed post-SA contexts. Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics of discourse organizational devices for learning contexts. The developmental trends of   
discourse organizational devices are illustrated in Figs. 1-5, respectively. TPs were used more frequently in the post-SA and delayed   
post-SA contexts than in the pre-SA and SA contexts, with small to large effect sizes. NSs were used less frequently in the SA context

than in the pre-SA, post-SA, and delayed post-SA contexts, with the largest effect size in the mean difference between the SA and pre-SA contexts. TCs demonstrated a relatively stable pattern without any significant differences across the learning contexts, yielding small effect sizes. SCs exhibited an omega-shaped pattern, peaking in the SA context and then declining, with medium to large effect sizes in the mean differences between the SA and post-SA/delayed post-SA contexts. CCs showed a linear growth trend across the learning contexts, with small effect sizes in the mean differences between adjacent contexts. Table 6 lists the 14 GMs used in the essays. The GMs began to emerge in the SA context and continued through the post-SA and delayed post-SA contexts. Most of the GMs were realized through the nominalization of verbs and adjectives; however, two instances of GMs were realized by the causative verb 导致 dǎozhì (lead to/cause) that lexicalized the cause-and-effect relationship.

# 7. Discussion

The present study explores the effects of genre and learning context on writing performance and discourse organization in L2 Chinese. The results reveal that the holistic ratings of argumentative essays are generally higher than those of narrative essays. Additionally, argumentative essays tend to generate more TCs, SCs, and GMs, whereas narrative essays generate more CCs and TPs in L2 Chinese. No discernible effect of genre on NSs is observed. These findings corroborate and extend previous research indicating that L2 English learners use more subordinate clauses (Lu, 2011; Staples & Reppen, 2016) and complex noun phrases/nominalization (Lu, 2011; Staples & Reppen, 2016; Yoon & Polio, 2017) in argumentative writing. However, these findings contradict Yoon and Polio’s (2017) results regarding the lack of genre effect on subordination and coordination in L2 English writing and Lu’s (2011) discovery of more coordination in L2 English argumentative writing. It is worth noting that Lu’s (2011) coordination measures are based on co ordinate phrases and T-units per sentence, whereas the present study relies on coordinate clauses per clause. This distinction in measurement methods may contribute to the divergent findings and warrants further exploration.

# 7.1. Genre effect

The genre effect on discourse organizational devices found in this study can be explained by the genre characteristics within the framework of SFL (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Yoon & Polio, 2017). In narrative writing, writers are required to narrate a series of events. This typically draws writers’ attention to the characters, their actions, and surroundings in the events. Thus, writers tend to employ topic–comment sentences to highlight the appearance and traits of the characters, $B a$ -constructions to provide specific spatial and resultative information about the actions, existential sentences to describe the physical environments, and topic chains to establish sequential connections between the actions. Also, topic chains usually consist of multiple coordinate clauses. This genre requirement may lead to higher frequencies of both TPs and CCs in narrative essays.

On the other hand, TCs, SCs, and GMs occur more frequently in argumentative writing, because writers need to present arguments, discuss opinions and beliefs, and persuade the reader, which entails more expressions of complex semantic relations, reasoning, and hypotheses. These semantic relations commonly encompass causal, concessive, conditional, and contrastive relations, most of which are signaled by TCs and realized in the form of SCs (e.g., 因为 y¯ınw´ei because-, 虽然 su¯ıran ´ although-, and 如果 rúguǒ if-clauses). In addition, to articulate coherent arguments and ensure a smooth flow of information, textual elements need to be introduced, repeated, referenced, and abstracted over extended stretches of discourse, which can be achieved by GMs (Liard´et, 2013). Particularly, GMs through the nominalization of verbs allow writers to avoid mentioning the agent in discourse, thus creating a more impersonal, objective stance in expressing opinions and beliefs (Yang, 2011). This gives rise to the exclusive use of GMs in argumentative essays, especially with the growth of writing proficiency.

No discernible difference in NSs between the two genres is observed, indicating that some discourse organizational devices are more prone to demonstrate invariance across different genres than others (Zhang & Lu, 2022). However, a close examination of the linguistic environments in which NSs are employed provides evidence in favor of the genre effect. In narrative writing, NSs mostly occur in topic chains where a series of actions are described and linked, and subjects in the coordinate clauses are omitted to avoid repetition of the topic in the first clause (see sentence 9 written by Henry). Conversely, in argumentative writing, NSs are associated with hypothetical arguments and stance-taking statements, allowing Henry to maintain an impersonal, objective tone in these ex pressions without using pronouns such as you, we, or it (cf. Liao, 2020; see sentence 10 written by Henry). In sum, the use of discourse organizational devices in the two genres is closely associated with the spatial-temporal nature of narrative writing and the logical and causal reasoning featured in argumentative writing, respectively.

Alternative explanations for the findings in this study, underpinned by the Cognitive Hypothesis, may also be plausible (Robinson, 2003; Staples & Reppen, 2016). The higher level of logical thinking and causal reasoning demanded in argumentative writing tends to elicit language with greater complexity and sophistication (e.g., SCs and GMs). When discussing the level of writing task difficulty in different genres, it is crucial to consider learners’ perceptions. Henry has claimed that narrative essays are more restrictive in terms of using specific and precise words to describe the actions and details depicted in the pictures (fifth interview at the end of spring 2021). These words are less frequently used and may not be commonly taught in the classroom. In contrast, argumentative essays provide more freedom in choosing vocabulary at one’s disposal. When feeling unconfident or hesitant about using certain words, learners can always seek to circumvent them by using other familiar words.

This is directly relevant to the writing task characteristics identified in Robinson’s (2011) triadic componential framework of L2 task complexity and difficulty. This framework provides a detailed description of task demands placed on L2 learners and distinguishes resource-directing and resource-dispersing task characteristics. Resource-directing characteristics allow learners to focus their attentional resources on producing more complex and accurate language, whereas resource-dispersing characteristics diffuse learners’ attentional resources, making it harder for them to produce complex and accurate language. It seems that more linguistic choices and higher topic familiarity in argumentative writing tasks function as resource-directing characteristics, enabling Henry to focus his attention on the production of more complex and advanced language and engage in higher-order processes, such as idea development, content organization, and editing. In contrast, difficulties presented by narrative writing tasks, particularly in the dimensions of lexicon and topic familiarity, may involve Henry in lower-order processes, such as formulating, encoding, and translating, thus reducing the holistic ratings of his narrative essays.

However, both native English writers and L2 English writers use more complex language in argumentative essays in Yoon and Polio’s (2017) study. This leads the authors to argue that the observed differences in language use between argumentative and narrative essays should be attributed to the genre effect, rather than the Cognitive Hypothesis, because native speakers are presumably not subject to the cognitive and linguistic constraints imposed by the writing tasks. Overall, the current literature provides inconclusive empirical findings on which account is more convincing. It is worth noting that, as in the present study, genres and other writing task characteristics (e.g., writing prompts) are often inextricably intertwined. Therefore, it is highly possible that many interrelated factors jointly shape L2 writing processes and products. Further investigation is needed to determine which factors, such as genre, cognitive demand, attentional resources, and topic familiarity, contribute the most and how these factors interact to influence L2 written production (Johnson, 2017).

# 7.2. Contextual effect

With regard to the learning context effect, the holistic ratings of narrative essays remain relatively stable throughout four learning   
contexts; however, the ratings of argumentative essays show a remarkable increase during the SA context, followed by a gradual   
decline in the post-SA and delayed post-SA contexts. The writing proficiency gains made during the SA context are not maintained after   
SA, which aligns with the attritional effect of post-SA phases on L2 writing performance found in P´erez-Vidal and Juan-Garau’s (2009)   
study. The findings of no significant effects of the learning context on narrative ratings and TCs partially support previous findings that   
SA experiences may not have noticeable effects on certain aspects of language (e.g., grammar) in L2 writing development (e.g., Godfrey   
et al., 2014; P´erez-Vidal & Juan-Garau, 2009; Sasaki, 2007; Serrano et al., 2011; Zaytseva et al., 2022). Henry demonstrates solid intermediate-level proficiency in L2 Chinese writing in the pre-SA context and begins to achieve

![](img/3a981ebf00096b368957401a6d22956c5e55b431ee072254edb8334a036514c0.jpg)  
Fig. 4. Subordinate clauses across learning contexts.

advanced-level ratings in the SA context (see Table 3). As for holistic writing performance, it is well established that progress in L2 writing typically takes a long period of time (e.g., Ortega, 2003; Serrano et al., 2012). The specific words and expressions required for narrative essays, which are usually more subtle and less frequently used, need much longer time and a large amount of authentic input exposure to acquire and accumulate. It may be difficult to manifest improvement in holistic ratings within one year of SA. In contrast, Henry has control over the language he chooses to use in argumentative essays, paving the way for him to demonstrate the more complex and advanced words and expressions he has learned during SA.

Similarly, it is highly likely that Henry’s mastery of TCs enters a stabilized phase in the pre-SA context. Research shows that L2 learners often acquire a limited set of the most commonly used and simple connectives at the earliest stages of interlanguage development. Subsequently, they tend to adhere to these early-acquired connectives at later stages (Cao, 2013; Liao, 2020; Lu, 2019; Yang, 2013). In Henry’s essays, several additive connectives (e.g., 而且 ´erqiˇe [also]), contrastive connectives (e.g., 但是 danshì \` [but]), causative connectives (e.g., 所以 suǒyǐ [so]), and conditional connectives (e.g., 如果 rúguǒ [if]) are consistently used across the learning contexts. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the use of TCs fluctuates within a narrow range throughout the four learning contexts. In other words, TCs are no longer sensitive enough to contextual factors to show noticeable gains or losses.

Prior to SA, Henry has completed the second-year Chinese course, in which most, if not all, TPs have been taught. However, a majority of TPs are very subtle and non-salient. These TPs are further consolidated and internalized in the immersive environment of SA and become more productive after SA. Thus, SA appears to have a postponed, rather than an immediate, effect on the use of TPs. In contrast, Henry uses less NSs in the SA context; that is, more overt subjects are used in the SA context. This is probably because during SA, Henry employs more overt subjects to make his essays clearer and easier for the reader to track referents in the discourse.

The trends observed in CCs and SCs are particularly intriguing, as the measures capture the subtleties of their trajectories across the learning contexts. The finding of a linear increase in CCs over time (see Fig. 5) contradicts Norris and Ortega’s (2009) proposal of syntactic complexification stages, which suggests that coordination may cease to grow or even decline toward higher levels of development. Instead, this finding aligns with the growth of coordination documented in some L2 English studies (Bult´e & Housen, 2014; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Lu, 2011) and L2 Chinese studies (Hu et al., 2022; Jin, 2007; Lu & Wu, 2022). This finding suggests that Henry gradually develops an awareness of the preference for coordination over subordination in Chinese discourse, especially in Chinese narratives.

![](img/c0a50a4dd490f987a7464c7efc58a35cf65964cb68c22d9f11607b4dfc82093a.jpg)  
Fig. 5. Coordinate clauses across learning contexts.

However, the use of SCs resonates with Norris and Ortega’s (2009) proposal of syntactic complexification stages. SCs display an inverted V-shaped pattern throughout the four learning contexts (see Fig. 4), roughly mirroring the trajectory of holistic ratings for argumentative essays. This pattern may be elucidated by several reasons. As a writing strategy to enhance the complexity or perceived quality of essays, Henry may take advantage of subordination and use it more extensively during the SA phase. However, as Henry becomes more attuned to the paratactic nature of Chinese discourse and incorporates more coordination, a trade-off between coordination and subordination leads to a decrease in the use of subordination. Furthermore, according to Norris and Ortega’s (2009) proposal, subordination is likely to give way to phrasal elaboration, such as complex noun phrases and nominalizations in GMs, at more advanced levels of L2 development (Biber et al., 2011; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Hu et al., 2022; Lu & Wu, 2022; Wu & Lu, 2024). Subordinate clauses expressing causative relationships may also be substituted with causative words via GMs (Byrnes, 2009; Liard´et, 2013, 2015).

The effect of learning context on the use of GMs can be observed from the second half of SA until the end of the delayed post-SA context. Aligned with the universal phenomenon that nominalization accounts for a predominant majority of GMs (Liard´et, 2015; Yang, 2011), most GMs used by Henry are derived from the nominalization of verbs and adjectives. As mentioned previously, Chinese lacks morphological variations to mark nominalization (except for the derivational suffix -性 xìng in instance 13 in Table 6), thus rendering the nominalization of verbs and adjectives straightforward and easy for L2 Chinese learners (Yang, 2008, 2011). As Byrnes (2009) states, “GM use is at once an indicator of expanding lexico-grammatical capacity, of discursive-textual competence, of topic competence and genre-based literacy, and ultimately related to how a writer wishes to position himself/herself,” and thus, GM use reflects a writer’s capability of integrating “all linguistic meaning-making resources” (p. 60). Indeed, after one semester of SA, Henry is able to manipulate the lexical categories of words, enhance textual referencing, create more coherent argument structures, and adopt appropriate writing styles (Godfrey et al., 2014; Storch, 2009; Whittaker et al., 2011).

This is exemplified in the two-sentence discourse below (see also instances 1 and 2 in Table 6), which entails multiple hypothetical cause-and-effect relationships. The first sentence states a hypothetical cause-and-effect scenario in which a public school’s decision to install luxury facilities may attract prospective students and improve their living conditions. The second sentence proposes another hypothetical scenario based on the first one: luxury facilities may cause an increase in tuition; if luxury facilities do not affect tuition, it is not a problem. Henry uses the pronoun 这 zh\`e (this) in the initial position of the second sentence to refer back to the hypothetical scenario proposed in the first sentence. This pronoun is embedded in a cause-and-effect relationship withiin the second sentence. Instead of using a causal connective to construct a subordinate causal clause, Henry chooses to employ the advanced causative word 导 致 dǎozhì (lead to) to convey the causal relationship in the second sentence, where the second hypothetical scenario is proposed. Meanwhile, rather than using the verb phrase 提高学费 tígao ¯ xu´ef\`ei (to increase tuition), which parallels the verb phrase in the first sentence 提高他们的生活水平 tígao ¯ tamen ¯ de sh¯enghu´o shuǐpíng (to improve their living conditions), Henry opts for the nominalized phrase 学费的提高 xu´ef\`ei de tígao ¯ (the increase in tuition) as the object of the causative verb 导致 dǎozhì (lead to). These lexical-grammatical choices create a more condensed and coherent argument.

Written production can be better understood as the outcome of interplay between L2 development and instruction (Ortega, 2015). The L2 instruction that Henry received may provide a complementary perspective to better explain the effect of learning contexts on writing performance and discourse organization in this study. The curriculum, whether during SA or at the home institution, primarily focuses on lexico-grammatical features that are more commonly taught and arguably more salient and overt in linguistic form (e.g., TPs, TCs, and NSs), while lacking dedicated writing instruction for discourse organizational competence that emphasizes the use of more opaque discourse organizational devices (i.e., SCs, CCs, and GMs). As previously discussed, Henry may have initially acquired the features of TPs, TCs, and NSs through classroom instruction before SA. In contrast, the awareness and control of SCs, CCs, and GMs have gradually developed via implicit and incidental learning in immersive SA environments.

# 7.3. Pedagogical implications

This longitudinal case study may offer insights into L2 Chinese writing instruction. As suggested by the findings, genres and discourse organizational devices are mutually interwoven. Effective writing instruction may involve genre-based writing tasks that both raise learners’ awareness of genre characteristics in L2 writing and foster the development of linguistic features pertinent to specific genres in Chinese (Harman, 2013; Hyland, 2007; Yasuda, 2011, 2015). This approach can promote the synergy between learning-to-write and writing-to-learn dimensions of L2 writing (Manchon, ´ 2011). In particular, form-focused techniques, such as metalinguistic explanation and corrective feedback, can be integrated into genre-based writing instruction to facilitate the learning of certain opaque and subtle discourse organizational devices (e.g., TPs, NSs, GMs, and CCs). Research has shown that explicit instruction facilitates L2 learners’ use of topic chains in various writing tasks in Chinese, and more crucially, the facilitating effect is long-lasting (Zhou & Lü, 2022).

As some previous studies have shown, the observed improvement in writing performance on argumentative essays during the SA context suggests that immersion in a target language environment may significantly contribute to the development of writing skills and genre awareness. L2 Chinese educators may benefit from incorporating opportunities for students to engage in argumentative writing tasks during SA to capitalize on this boost. On the one hand, the sustained peak level of writing performance in the early post-SA context indicates a potential long-term positive effect. On the other hand, learners’ writing skills require continued support upon their return from an SA program. The finding that the holistic ratings of narrative essays remain stable around Intermediate-Mid and show no improvement during and after SA underscores the need for more comprehensive yet targeted instruction. Such instruction should exploit the affordances of SA environments to equip learners with the linguistic abilities necessary to perform better on narrative writing tasks, which is a key learning objective in SA programs to enhance L2 Chinese learners’ discourse competence across diverse communicative contexts.

# 8. Conclusion

The present study explored the effects of genre and learning context on writing performance and discourse organization in an L2 Chinese learner’s written production. The results reveal that narrative writings generally receive lower holistic ratings than argumentative writings and remain at the Intermediate-Mid level across four learning contexts over a period of four years. In contrast, the ratings of argumentative essays increase from Intermediate-Mid in the pre-SA context to Advanced-Mid during the SA context, with a sustained peak level in the early post-SA context and a subsequent decline to intermediate levels in the later post-SA and delayed postSA contexts. Additionally, genre effects are evident in TPs, TCs, SCs, CCs, and GMs, with TCs, SCs, and GMs being more prevalent in argumentative writing, while TPs and CCs are more frequently used in narrative writing. However, no discernible effect of learning context on NSs is found. These findings contribute to the existing body of literature on L2 writing by highlighting the distinctive developmental trajectories of writing performance and discourse organizational devices in response to genre and learning context. Accordingly, the integration of genre-based writing instruction into L2 Chinese curriculum may be conducive to learners’ ability to use appropriate discourse organizational devices in diverse genres, ultimately improving their discourse competence and writing proficiency.

It should be noted that these findings and their pedagogical implications are based on a case study, and that L2 writing is inherently an individualized endeavor. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution when generalizing these findings to learners from different language learning backgrounds or contexts. Future research should consider recruiting participants with more diverse backgrounds, such as heritage language learners, and exploring varied learning contexts, such as domestic immersion programs, to determine whether the learning context and genre effects observed in this study are consistent. Furthermore, other uninvestigated factors, such as writing prompt presentation, rater background, rating criteria, learners’ cognitive styles, and L1 writing proficiency, may have influenced the findings. Further investigation is needed to understand how these factors interact with genre and learning context to affect L2 Chinese writing performance and discourse organization.
