Keywords: Academic writing L2 English writing Effects of instruction Noun phrase modifiers NP modification Syntactic complexity

While previous research on syntactic complexity development in academic writing recommends incorporating instruction on complex noun phrases into L2 writing curricula, little is known about the effects of such teaching. Therefore, this study examined writing by undergraduate students enrolled in L2 writing courses to determine whether explicit teaching of complex noun phrases could lead to more register-appropriate use of these features. Specifically, this research compared diagnostic and final in-class writing produced by 30 students who received explicit noun phrase instruction and also conducted a separate analysis of 30 papers by writers who did not experience such teaching. Since prompts were found to be a mediating factor in previous research, this variable was also considered in the analysis. The results demonstrate that while both groups displayed patterns of development, targeted instruction led to more frequent use of complex noun phrases in general and of noun phrase modifiers associated with advanced stages of syntactic complexity development. Additionally, while prompts had an effect on some noun phrase fea. tures, overall trends in development remained unchanged. These findings support claims from previous research that explicit teaching of complex noun phrases may benefit writers' syntactic complexity development.

# 1. Introduction

The main goal of any second language (L2) composition course is to asst writers in developing the knowledge and skills necessary for effective wrtten communication for academic purposes. From a linguistic perspective, this development is usually supported and assesed in terms of accuracy, fluency, and complexty (Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki,  Kim, 1998). While writing curricula tend to focus on the first two components more often, complexity - and specifically syntactic complexity - may be often overlooked in writing instruction and pedagogy-oriented research. For example, an examination of the conference programs from five TEsoL conventions (2015-2019) revealed that only five presentations focused on complexity in academic writing, with only two explicitly mentioning grammatical or syntactic complexity. This number is rather low considering that TEsOL conventions feature more than a thousand presentations each year. At the same time, the focus on syntactic complexity can be reasonably expected at pedagogy-oriented conferences since this construct has recently been challenged and reconsidered in research (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011).

Traditionally syntactic complexity has been operationalized in terms of large-grained measures (see reviews and meta-analyses by Lan, Liu, & Staples, 2019; Ortega, 2003; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998). This approach includes measures of average length of T-units (i. e., the main clause withattached dependent clauses), clauses, and sentences as well as the ratio of these units to one another and to other structures (e.g., coordination) (Hunt, 1965; as cited in Lan, Liu, & Staples, 2019). More recently, however, large-grained measures have received criticism, and instead, a different conceptualization has been proposed. Biber et al. (2011) argued that large-grained measures confound multiple grammatical features that have specific functional and distributional patterns in academic discourse. As ault, these masures fail to capture pcific feres that ontribute to the ength of certain units. ntr litationof large-grained measures is that they often reflect complexity in terms of dependent clause embedding, which is in fact common for spoken reisters rather than academic prose (Biber e al., 2011). The later, however, was found to rely more on complex noun phrase. which allow writers to compress nformation and produce concise discourse with dense meaning (ee detailed discussion of limitations as well as distinction between spoke registers and academic prose in terms of clausal and phrasal complexity in Biber et al., 2011, and Biber, Gray, Staples, & Egbert, 2020). Therefore, relying on findings of previous large-scale corpus research on occurrence and co-occurrnce of grammatical features in various registers (e.g., studies based on Biber's, 1988, multidimensional analysis; Biber, Johansso, Leech, Conrad, & Finean, 199), Biber etal. (2011) have proposed to consider normed frequencies f noun phrase features as a measure of syntactic complexity development in academic writing. This group of researchers also hypothesized that writers progress through specific developmental stages with a shift from reliance on dependent clause constituents to greater use of noun phrase modification.

The importance of noun phrases for academic writing development was confirmed in multiple descriptive studies that tested Biber et al's (2011) framework directly (Biber, Reppen, Staples, & Egbert, 2020; Lan & Sun, 2019; Lan, Lucas, & Sun, 2019; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples, Egbert, Biber, & Gray, 2016) or followed other conceptualizations f syntactic complexity (e.g., Casal & Lee, 2019; Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Lu, 2011. As a result, many of these studies recommend that noun phrases be explicitly taught in L2 writing clarooms as a means of supporting student' syntactic complexity development. It is unclear, however, whether such teaching may indeed lead to more register-appropriate use of noun phrases, which would reflect conventions of academic writing register. The purpose f this study is to empiriclly test the validity of the recommendations to integrate noun phrase teaching into L2 writing curcula by investigating the effects of such instruction. Since most L2 writers' experince with academic writing within an ESL seting begins with a first-year writing (FYW) course, this study focuses on this student population and compares noun phrase use in their diagnostic and final writing. YW courses may be properly positioned for noun phrase instruction since the goal of such courses is to prepare students for writing at the university level. onsidering that university writers were found to use compressed noun phrase features more rquentl as they progres through educational lels (., Biber, Reppen, et a., 2020; Staples e l., 2016), it may be useful to raise students awarenes of complex noun phrases during introductory writing courses in order to asst them in developing syntactic complexity in writing.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Role of phrasal features in syntactic complexity development.

Biber et al. (2011) hypothesized stages of syntactic complexity development, which move from finite dependent clauses to non-finite clauses and then to phrases (in terms of grammatical structures) and from clause constituents to noun phrase modifiers (in terms of syntactic functions). This progression towards reliance on phrasal features as noun modifier, or "compressed noun phrases", was confirmed by descriptive studies comparing writig at different academic levels. For example, in a cross-sectional study, Staples et al. (2016) examined writing by students who used English as their first language (L1) at four levels (frst, second, final-undergraduate, and graduate) and found that students used compressed noun phrase features (e.g., aributive adjectives, nouns as premodifiers) more frequently and relied less on dependent clause features (e.g., verb $^ +$ that-clauses, finite adverbial clauses) as their academic level increased. The use of these features was also mediated by discipline (e.g., humanities writing relied on clausal features to a greater extent than social or life sciences) and genre Similar resuls were found in a longitudinal study by Biber, Reppen, et al. (2020), who examined writing by 22 L2 Englishstudents at two points of time with a two-year interval. They focused on two dependent clause feares (i., adverbia clauses and relative clauses) and to phrasl noun modifiers (i., atriutive adeties and nouns as premodifiers and found that the use of clausal features declined or remained unchanged while the use of phrasal features, especially nouns as premodifiers, increased. These findings confirm the hypothesizd progression of students moving from reliance on dependent clauses to phrasal features as noun modifiers.

While not testing the framework directly, other longitudinal studies on student writing revealed that a shift to greater use of noun phrase features may happen even within a short period of time. Bulte and Housen (2014) found an increase in the length of noun phrases when examining development that occurred over a semester-long EAP course. Even within one month, Mazgutova and Kormos (2015) found that the mean length of T-units and clausal embedding decreased, and the frequency of phrasal features increased in both lower and higher-level proficiency groups. The changes prompted by this short EAP course happened without any explicit instruction on syntactic features. Crossley and McNamara (2014) also identified that by the end of a semester-long EAP course, students used more modifiers in a noun phrase, more words before the main verb (both measures of phraal complexity), and fewer clauses. These studies have demonstrated that an increase in noun phrase features was a part of linguistic development prompted by a month- or semester-long EAP course, even if no explicit instruction had been provided on these features.

The importance of noun phrases for complexity development was also confirmed by research examining the association between syntactic omplexity features and writing quality or proficiency.  greater rliance on noun phrase modifiers was found to distinguish higher-rated writing present in placement tes for undergraduate international students in the U.S. (Taguchi, Crawford, & Wetzel, 2013) and source-based research essays in the FYW context (Casal & Lee, 2019). A complementary line of research that focuses on building statistical models that predict essay scores also found that select noun phrase features explained variation in higher- and lower-scoring essays in TOEFL iBT (Kyle & Crossey, 2018), undergraduate argumentative essays for a national ontest (Xu, 2019), and argumentative essays writte for graduate matrculation in Thailand (Thongyoi & Poonpon, 2020). Only a few studies did not find an association between the greater reliance on noun phrase modifiers and scores, including the research on TOEFL iBT writing by Biber, Gray, and Staples (2014). This finding was explained by the nature of scoring rubrics that placed little emphasis on lingustic feature use. Overall, however, the majority of research investigating syntactic complexity in relation to writing quality and proficiency identified the important role of noun phrase features.

# 2.2. Noun phrases and the hypothesized development

Considering the established importance of noun phrases in academic writing development, several studies focused specifically on the subset of noun phrase modifiers from Biber et al's (2011 framework to test the proposed progression. Table 1 presents this framework that includes elements of noun phrase pre- and postmodification together with the developmental stages of syntactic complexity with which each modifier is associated.

The studies that tested this progression at the noun phrase level generally confirmed the hypothesized development. Examining this sequence in writing by international EAP and MA TES0L students, Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) found that EAP students relied more on atributie ajectives and les on other phrasal modifiers , nouns, preositional phrases, ppositive) in comparison toMA TESOL students. Since atributive adjectives correspond to Stage 2 of the developmental framework and other features to more advanced stages, tis study confirmed the proposed developmental progressin. Also, argumentative essays in FY courses were found to contain noun phrases with more advanced modification if they were wrtten by more proficient writers, as evidenced by student TOEFL scores (Lan & Sun, 2019; Lan, Lucas, & Sun, 2019). Given that the developmental progression proposed by Biber et al. (2011) received some validation in previous research, it is also adopted in the current study.

# 2.3. Pedagogy-oriented research on syntactic complexity development

Having determined the importance of noun phrase structures for writers' complexity development, multiple descriptive studies have pointed out in their pedagogical implications that teaching complex noun phrases should be introduced in L2 academic writing courses. For example, Lu (2011), who identified complex nominalsper clause as a measure distinguishing writing at two adjacent undergraduate academic levels, sugested that \*instructors may wish to help students improve the ability to engage complexity at the phrasal level as they progress to advanced proficiency levels" (p. 59) Larsson and Kaatari (2020), who found that select noun phrase features distinguished learner and expert writing, noted that t would sem important for novice writers wishing to start an academic career to be made aware of these more or les explicit standards and expectations" (p. 10). While similar recommendations were provided by many other researchers (Casal & Lee, 2019; Lan & Sun, 2019; Lan, Liu, & Staples, 2019; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015), it is unclear whether such explicit instruction has indeed become a common focus of L2 writing curricula (as evidenced by the survey of TESOL conference presentations). Only one recent qualitative study by Casal and Lu (2021) reported incorporating instruction on complex noun phrases - among other syntactic complexity features - in an L2 graduate EAP course. Apart from this study and Musgrae and Parkinson's (2014) pedagogy-oriented article, there seems to be littl guidance for teachers on incorporating noun phrase in. struction into writing classrooms.

At the same time, the efects of complex noun phrase instruction have not been empirically tested. Considering that composition teachers already need to cover multiple writing-related topics and that the development of noun phrase use occurs without explicit instruction (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014) it is crucial to understand whether providing such instruction is eficient or necessary. Casal and Lu (2021), who examined L2 graduate students' perspectives on engaging in complexity-focused activities, found that participants positively evaluated such activities, reporting raised awarenessof complexity features in academic writing. While these qualitative insights help us understand writers perceptions of learning about complex noun phrases, it is unclear whether instruction may lead to quantitative changes of noun phrases in student writing. To address this gap, the present study investigates whether explicit noun phrase instruction embedded throughout a FYw course may lead to more register-appropriate production of these features in L2 writers' texts. In thistudy, "registr-appropriate" use is operationalized as more frequent use of noun phrases in general, of modifier associated with more advanced stages of Biber et al.'s (2011) developmental framework, and of compressed noun phrase features. This operationalizatin was based on findings from the previously discussed research on complexity development in academic writing (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Crossey & McNamara, 2014; Lan & Sun, 2019; Lan, Lucas, & Sun, 2019; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples et al., 2016; Biber, Reppen, et al., 2020). While the functional aspect is clearly an important component of "register-appropriate" production, this dimension, which requires detailed qualitative analysis, is out f scope of this study and needs to be addressed in future research.

Register-appropriate use is examined in writing by students who received instruction on complex noun phrase features, and specifically in their diagnostic and final in-cassesays. The essays were the first and last writing inthe course and could thus provide insights into the instruction effects. To have a relative point of comparison, writing by a different group that reeived no noun phrase instruction is also examined. The described data are used to address the following research question: Does explicit instruction on complex noun phrases in an undergraduate L2 writing course lead to more register-appropriate use of these features?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Research design

It i mportant to establish that this study did not adopt a true experimental design with an experimental and control group from the same student population. Instead, the main focus of this study was on the group that received explicit instruction on complex noun phrases, and specifically the comparison between this group's diagnostic and final writing. However, since previous research has demonstrated that the shift towards more register-appropriate use of noun phrases happens even without targeted instruction (as discussed in Literature Review), it was necessary to include a group that fllowed a curriculum not focusing on noun phrases and observe the degre of development occurring within this group. This group was included only as a relative benchmark: the participants, while being enrolled in aFYw course, were from a different university and had slightlydifferent demographic background characteristics (see Section 3.2 for more details). The two groups were therefore not directly compared statistically.

# 3.2. Participants

The total of 60 undergraduate multlingual students enrolled in L2 FYW courses in the U.S. produced essays analyzed in this research. 30 participants comprised the group that received instruction on noun phrases as a part of a FYw curriculum at alarge suburban university in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. This group wil be referred to as the Noun Phrase Instruction (NP-1I) group. Minimum requirements for course enrollment included scoring 80 on TOEFL iBT with a minimum of 18 in each subsection. L1s of the participants included a variety of languages, including Arabic (13), Chinese (7), Vietnamese (2) as well as Bulgarian, Dutch, Finnish, Korean, Malayalam, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish (1 each). The second group, which will be clld the Regular Instruction (Reg-) group comprised 30 students enrolled i the firt of the two courses in the sequence of FYW for multilingual and international students at a large rural university in the U.S. Midwest. Students were placed into this course if they scored a minimum of 68 on TOFL iBT with the writing subsection score between 17 and 24. The students' 1s included Chinese (25) and Arabic (5). As can be seen, the Reg-I group had lower minimum TOEFL score requirements' and less varied L1s (mostly Chinese). Considering the impact of TOEFL scores on noun phrase feature use identified in previous research (e.g, Lan & Sun, 2019; Lan, Lucas, & Sun, 2019) and the specific nature of noun phrase structures in different languages (e.g., in Chinese, nouns can only take premodification, as mentioned in Ruan. 2018; or in Spanish, nouns cannot modify nouns, as was relevant in Parkinson, 2015), these variables should be considered when interpreting the results. To prevent the inroduction of construct-irrlevant variance due to these variable, the two groups were not directly compared in the same satistical model. The focus was on the change within each group rather than the comparison between the groups.

Each group consisted of students who weretaught by two instructors. In the NP-I goup, 19 students were enrolld in courses taught by the researcher and 11 students in a course taught by a diffrent instructor. In the Reg-I group, 14 students were taught by the researcher, and 16 stdents were instucted by adiffernt teacher. At each instittion, the reercher and the ther instuctor folowed the pre-determined curricula (which are described in the next section); thus, students received similar instruction within one institution, although they took classes with different instructors.

# 3.3. Instruction

Both groups followed standardized curricula within their corresponding institutions. In general, apart from the focus on nour phrases within one institution, the currcula were similar since they were designed to develop students rhetorical, proces, and linguistic knowledge and skills. Major asgnments in both goups went through revisions over the drats based on peer and instructor comments. These assignments included two analytical summaries and a synthesis paper for the NP-I group, and a summary, summaryresponse, and argumentative source-based essy for the Reg-I group. The main difference in the instruction was that students from the NP-I group engaged in learning about complex noun phrases and applying this knowledge throughout the semester (the detailed description of this instruction is presented below).? While the Reg-I group received instruction on various grammatical features, the teaching of complex noun phrases was not integrated into the curriculum.

The noun phrase-related activities and assinments that the NP-I group completed throughout the semester are listed in Appendix A (other routine writing-related topic covered in the curriculum are not included in the appendix table) First, students were introduced to the notion of syntactic complexity and the role of noun phrases in syntactically complex writing. Students learned the grammatical structure of noun phrases represented by four slots (i.e., determiner, pre-modification, head noun, and post-modification) along with the grammatical features that can take each slot. It is important to emphasize that these features were not presented in relation to stages in Biber et al. (2011). This was done to prevent potential misinterpretation of the framework (e.g., students choosing to use Stage 5 modifiers only). Instead, students were simply inroduced to the range of features that could be used as pre- or postmodifiers. After completing multiplecontrolled exercises aimed at practicing noun phrase component identification, students engaged in noticing noun phrases in course texts. These texts included published per-reviewed research articles provided by instructors and were used as a basis for writing two analytical summaries, major course assignments. A part of the analytical summary ssignment was the analysis of several noun phrases that referred to the main concepts of the article tudents had to determine what meaning was packaged into noun phrases and how this meaning helps writers add new information to or specify the main concept. After noticing and analyzing noun phrases in published texts, students proceeded to noticing use or lack of use of noun phrases in their own writing and transforming clauses into noun phrases where it was functionally appropriate. While students were encouraged to use noun phrases in their writing, they were not directly evaluated on the frequency of this feature use to avoid the perction that the quantity of noun phrases alone makes academic writing more efective. Focus on complex noun phrases was sustained throughout the course through activities, major assinments, and instructor feedack. As much as 250 minutes of cass time during the 15-week semester were devoted to various activities related to noun phrase use in addition to homework tasks.

# 3.4. Essays

In order to determine the effect of explicit noun phrase instruction on the production of these features, this study examined diagnostic and final writing within the context of L2 FYw. These two types of texts were chosen because they were the first and the last writing that students produced in a course. A total of 120 timed in-classource-based essays were examined: 60 by the NP-I group and 60 by the Reg-I group. Within each group, halfof the essays were diagnostic writing, and the other half were final writing that was produced by the same writers within an interval of 15 weeks. The information about the essays can be found in Table 2.

While data were collected from two institutions, the requirements for the diagnostic and final writing were similar. Both types of writing represent the register of timed in-class source-based writing. The diagnostic test required students to read a short excerpt and then respond to an open-ended question based on the source information. The same format was used for the final in-class writing, but this time students had to incorporate evidence from two provided sources and demonstrate the skill acquired in the course. The texts were written in response to three sets of prompts one set of diagnostic and final writing for the NP-I group and two sets of prompts for the Reg-I group (see Appendix B). While having one set of prompts in each group would be methodologically preferred, it was not possible in the case of the Reg-I group due to low enrollments in L2 FYW courses at that universty, which used new sets of prompts every semester. owever, the statistical compariso i., independent samples -test) of thesays written on two prompts revealed no significant differences in the use of most target features, which suggested that ittle additional variance was introduced due to the prompt differences within the Reg-I group. Inthe course taken by the NP-I group, on the other hand, the same set f prompts was used over multiple semesters, which allowed for more consistent data collection.

# 3.5. Feature identification and analysis

To identify whether explicit instruction on complex noun phrases led to more register-appropriate use of these features, the developmental framework by Biber et al. (2011) wasfllowed. Specifically, I focused on the subset of noun phrase features from Table 1 to identif frequencies of specific noun phrase modifiers. The framework, however, only partilly accounted for instances when a head noun had more than one modifier; therefore, as will be discussed below, I introduce an aditional classfication to determine the frequency of complete noun phrases and their structural types. In sum, this study examined the frequency of specific noun phrase modifiers associated with a particular developmental stage as well a complete complex noun phrases. This analysis was conducted twice to also determine prompt effects.

# 3.5.1. Noun phrase modifiers

As Table 1 demonstrates, several changes were made to Biber et al.'s (2011) framework in this study. First, in the original framework, quantifiers containing of were a part the of-phrase category. However, considering their distinct grammatical function and the fact that they may be frequent in L2 writing (Bychkovska & Le, 2017), quantifiers were separated into their own category in the present study. tis worth noting that if a quantifier was aditionally modified, it was trated as aregular noun phrase. For example, number of was clasified as a quantifier, but a considerable number of was not considered a quantifier due to the aditional modification. The second modification to the framework was the exclusion of appositive noun phrases, which belong to Stage 5 in the original classfication. This feature was excluded because its use in the current study was institutional context dependent. Appositives were mostly used by the Reg-I group to introduce experts from the provided texts (in most cases verbatim), which was a course requirement for the Reg-I group, but not for the NP-I group. Therefore, inclusion of the appositive category would not accurately reflect student development. A total of 11 modification features were examined, and while instances of adverbs modifying attrbutive adjectives appeared in the data, they were excluded from the analysis since these features was not in Biber et l's (2011) framework, whichthis study focused on.

Note: Ave. length $=$ average essay length; $s D =$ standard deviation; Range $=$ minimum-maximum values.

Before identifying the target features in the essays, thee texts were manually pre-processe y removing headers, tites, reerences and parenthetical elements of in-text citations i.., a yer in inteated citations; both the author and yer in non-integrated citations). Direct quotations were also removed from texts to ensure the focus on the language produced by student writers. In the cases when students used phrases from the provided text(s) but did not place quotation marks to identify citation boundaries, direct quotations" were operationalized as text strings of five or more words identical to the provided source text. Also, instances with non-standard spelling (e.g., back ground or team work) were changed into standardized forms (i.e., background or teamwork) to ensure consis tency. Consistency was aso ensured through: removing first names if writing contained both a first and last name of a person (e., Michael Jackson was changed into Jackson) reducing names of institutions into an abbreviated form (e.g., Ohio State University was changed into OsU); and changing the United States of America into the USA.

After the pre-processng stage, the texts were tagged for part of speech using the Biber Tagger software (Biber, 198), and Antonc (Anthony, 2019) was used to retrieve target features from Table 1. The retrieval was done through searching for a specific tag (for attrbutive adjectives, relative clauses, nonfinite relative clauses, and complement clauses) or regular expressions (for nouns and possessive nouns as premodifiers, prepositional phrases, and preposition. $^ +$ nonfinite complement clauses). Ungrammatical instances (e.g., people on Sydney instead of people of/in Sydney) were included in the analysis as long as the meaning was interpretable.

Since the modifiers were retrieved automatically, precision and recall are reported. $1 0 0 \%$ precision was ensured by manually checking concordance lines with automaticlly identified items and removing incorrctly identified features. For recall, a manual analysis of $1 0 \%$ of the texts revealed a $1 0 0 \%$ accuracy for most features with $9 3 \%$ for attributive adjectives and $9 5 \%$ for nouns as premodifiers; due to this high percentage, no further manual tag fixing was conducted. One feature, prepositional phrases other than of, required further manual coding: each instance was checked to ensure that it was indeed a noun postmodifier (e.g., Students in particular majors need to ...) rather than an adverbial (e.g., They built a stadium in a small town). $1 0 \%$ of the instances were coded by a second rater, and after two rounds of coding and discussion, inter-rater reliability was over $9 0 \%$

Finally, according to the framework in Table 1,prepositional phrases as postmodifiers may have 'concrete/locative' or abstract meaning. For this classfication, the framework by Biber and Gray (2016, p. 193) was followed. Concrete/locative meaning referred to several sub-categories: location inside a body part (e.g., pain in his knee), location inside/on the surface of an object or substance (e. 8., the ol n the themeter), graphc ocation ., our ohecaries in England), and tetual location , hi judgment nd candor in his writings). In the current study, given the prompt topics, two aditional categories were aded: online location (e.g., fake news on Facebook) and reference to human beings (e.g., news about Clinton). Other prepositional phrases were classified as 'abstract'.

# 3.5.2. Complete complex noun phrases

While conducting the analysis it became apparent that several patterns that emerged in the data were not addressed in Biber et al. s (2011) proposal. The original framework did not specify how to treat some of the instances when a noun phrase ontains more than one modifier. The framework did account for two types of complex modification (i.e, More phrasal embedding in the noun phrase: atributive adjective, nouns as premodifiers at Stage 4 and Extensive phrasal embedding in the NP: multiple repositional phrases as postmodifiers, with levels of embedding" at Stage 5), but it was unclear how to treat instances when, for example, a head noun had both pre- and postmodification.

Therefore, in addition to counting the frequency of each modifier, this study also separately identified the frequency of complete complex noun phrases. This separate focus is necessary since it takes into account the complete structure of a complex noun phrase, which may contain more than one modifier. A complex noun phrase, thus, may belong to one of the eight possible structural types (see Table 3). Simple pre- or postmodification refers to structures containing a noun head with only one modifier, while complex pre-or postmodification has two or more modifiers. The eight structural types were manuall identified in this study by examining concordance lines of each individual modification and matching them with other modifiers for the same noun phrase.

# 3.5.3. Effects of prompts on complexity features

Another important aspect that stood out during the analysis of the participants' texts was the repetition of noun phrases from the prompts. This repetition was expected because prompt noun phrases were the key terms in the esays. Considering that the prompts for the diagnostic and final writing were slightly diffrent within both groups, it was important to identify whether prompts had an efect on the observed differences.

To determine whether the prompt language had an effect on the noun phrase use, a second set of analysis was conducted. Whil the first analysi included all complex noun phraes, the second analysi excluded exact noun phrae from the prompt f they were used in the texts see Appendix C for the lis of noun phrases excluded from the second analysis). An example of the exact comple noun phrase is undergraduate students) from the prompt Isi important for undergraduate students to view themselves as scholars? Why or why not?" Another example is major intenational sporting event(s) and World Cup from the prompt " ., what factors do you think a country needs to consider before deciding to host major international sporting events (e.g., World Cup, the Olympics)" A noun phrase the Olympic Games, while not being the exact phrase from the prompt, was also excluded in the second analysi ecause it was full version of the Olympics The other exception was a phrase Sydney Olympics in 2000 that corresponds to the exact prompt phrase 2000 Sydney Olympics. In the cases where an exact phrase from the prompt was additionally modified, the original noun phrase was treated as one unit (e.g., the phrase wonderful mjor intemational sporting events was analyzed as having only one premodfication wonderful, and major international sporting events was considered a head of a noun phrase).

While it i clear that effect of prompts extend beyond the use of exact prompt language, as evidenced by previous reearch (Hinkel, 2002; Lan, Lucas, & Sun, 2019; Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015; Yoon, 2017), and the relation between a prompt and syntactic complexity is considerably more complex, the approach taken in this study is an attempt to minimize that effect and not completely eliminate it.

# 3.6. Statistical analysis

Frequencies of noun modification types and complex noun phrase structures in each text (rather than the whole corpus) were irst normed per 1,000 words (ptw) to account for variation in text length and allow for dispersion identification. Most of the features followed a normal disribution, and since parametric and non-parametric tests run on all features produced identical results, the decision was made to present the results of the parametric tes to ensure consistency. A series of paired samples t-tsts was conducted to compare noun phrase features in diagnostic and final writing for every student within the NP-I group and separately within the Reg-I group. Considering that multiple comparisons were performed for each analysis type (i.e., 12 for noun phrase modifiers and nine for noun phrase structures), Bonferroni correction was employed to control for Type I eror. The alpha level was adjuste to.004 (.05/12) for modification types and to .006 (.05/9) for complex noun phrase structures. The same analysis was repeated after the exact noun phrases from the prompt were excluded to determine whether the effect of instruction would change with prompt effcts minimized. Effect sizes, Cohen's $d$ values, were examined to identify the magnitude of the difference in the noun phrase use between the diagnostic and final writing. Following Cohen's (1988) guidelines, $d$ values were interpreted as small for $\sim . 2 0$ , medium for $\sim . 5 0$ , and large for $\sim . 8 0$ While both statistical significance and effect sizes were used to identify meaningful differences, ultimately, more focus was placed on $d$ values since they 1) indicate the extent of change rather than if the change occurred, 2) are independent from sample size, which was rlatively smal in this study, and 3) can be used to make comparisons between different populations. Thus, use of stan. dardized effct sizesalowed for the comparisons between the NP-I and Reg-I group despite their not being included in one statistical model.

# 4.1. Effect of instruction on noun phrase modification

To determine the effects of explicit instruction on complex noun phrase production, I first examined frequencies of modifiers associated with specific developmental stages from Biber et al. (2011) framework. Table 4 demonstraes the decriptive statistics and results of paired samples t-tests that compared frequencie of noun phrase modifiers in diagnostic and final writing by the group that received explicit instruction. As can be seen, the average frequency of almost all modifiers increase from diagnosticto final writing. The only modification type that was used lessfrequently is quantifiers, which may in fact indicate writer development since this change was mostly caused by a decrease in the colloquial phrase alot of I addtion to the increase in the average frequency of most modifiers, statistically significant differences were found in the total use of modifiers and nouns as premodifiers.

Table 3 Complex noun phrase structures.

The magnitude of difference between the NP-I group's diagnostic and final writing was medium to large for most modifiers. The highest efft i was ntifd fo th differe in us  all odfiers cobid lge), flow  noun as rmdfies medu to large) and by the features assciated with more advanced stages f syntactic complexity development (i.e, prepositional phrases having abstract meanings and noun complement clauses) with medium effect sizes. These modifiers crrespond to Stages 3,4, and 5 of the developmental framework by Biber et al. (2011. The idetified changes are llustrated in the following example from the same student's diagnostic and final writing (only the first three sentences from texts were included; modifiers are underlined):

Diagnostic writing: Ithink it is important for undergraduate students to view themselves as scholars. For example the article says: [quotation]. And I think feling fake is not good for your elf-trust and it may gie reult in your grades and it can make you think that you don't belong here. However, you do belong here because you graduated high school, so students just have to think like that. (NP-I_F1906_pre).

Final writing: I think undergraduate students should publish research. According to Jungck, undergraduate students' lives are changing in a positive way, because the experience could be a dream coming true and the students may also have an opportunity to be a contributor to the creation of scientific knowledge. Although there isa chance that undergraduate journals might not have significant benefit to science, the publication of the article would also put pressure on the faculty members. (NP-I_F1906_post)

In this example, the frequency of modifiers noticeably increased, and features from later stages of complexity development wer. used (e.g., a nonfinite relative clause, two complement clauses, two prepositional phrases with abstract meaning).

It is also important to highlight that with the exception of noun complement clauses, al features that underwent change with small to-medium or medium-to-large efect sizes (i.., previously mentioned nouns as premodifiers and prepositional phrases with abstract meaning as well as atributive adjectives, posessive nouns, prepositions with nonfinite complement clauses) are considered "compressed" noun phrase features according to Staples et al. (2016).

In contrast to the NP-I group, changes in the use of noun phrase modifiers in the Reg-I group were less consistent (see Table 5, note that the groups were not directly compared statisticall ecause they originated in diffeent populations). There was a large efect ize associated with the overall increase f total modifiers in the NP-I goup in comparison to small inthe Reg-I group. Average frequencies of some features in the Reg-I group increased (i., atributive adjectives, relative clauses, nonfinite relative clauses, prepositional phrases with abstract meaning, prepositions with nonfinite complement clauses, and noun complement clauses), while others decreased (e.g., nouns as premodifiers posessive nouns, quantifier, and preositional phrases with concrete meaning) or remained the same (i. of phrases). No significant ifferences were found between Reg-I group's diagnostic and final writig, and effec sizes ranged from medium to small Effect sizes for attributive adjectives and prepositional phrases (concrete meaning) were medium; for possessive nouns and nonfinite relative clauses between medium and small, forall other features small. Some of these trends, and specificall the increase in attributive adjectives and decrease in possesive nouns, are illstrate in the following example from the same student's diagnostic and final writing:

Diagnostic writing: According to Jenings, it states if or not fake information wil influence people, and how to handle with fake news in general. In ths article, some sociologist think that people only open the article they intest in, so a fake information willnot change a person's mind to many. I disagree with that, because I am easy to believe and change my mind from other people's views no matter the information is right or wrong. (Reg-I_F17549_pre).

Final writing: Nowadays, even though people actuall know what are some differences between fake news and real news, people still believe fake news. According to articl, motivated reasoning and naive realism are two constructs in psychological way. Firstly, motivated reasoning means that people are wiling to believe what they already thought, and this belief is subjective wishes. (Reg

Interesting developmental trends emerged when both groups were examined descriptively side-by-side. As Fig. 1 demonstrates, the NP-I and Reg-I group started with different frequencies of modifier use in their diagnostic writing and then followed different trajectories. It should also be noted that all comparisons revealed a high degre of variation among individual lerners, as evidenced by large standrddiations. The differnes were likely du ombintion f diffeent facors  instction type, ut ao different minimum TOEFL requirements for enrollment, L1 backgrounds, topics). In the Reg-I group, most change seemed to have occurred in the use of atributive adjectives assciated with Stage 2 of syntactic complexity development, while the increase in modifier use in the NP-I group was more consistently spread throughout ll stages. The most notable increase in NP-I can be seen on the right side of Fig. 1, for features associated with Stage 4 and Stage 5.

Another noteworthy trend is that while the groups use of some features was considerably iferent in diagnostic writing, by the end of the composition course, in their final writing, the average frequency of most features associated with Stage 3 (i.e., nouns as premodifiers, possessves, prepositional phrases with concret meaning) ecame similar. Whil the decrease in the use of these features in the Reg-I group may initiall be sen as a lack of development, after a closer examination it may be argued that slightly les frequent use of possessve nouns and prepositional phrases with concrete meaning may in fact be evidence of development in academic writing. It is suggested that \*academic discourse privileges impersonal language that moves away from naming or describing the actors (Liardet, 2016, p.27). Thus, since possessve nouns typically refer to human beings and concrete prepositional meaning i this study was operationalized as a reference to locations or human subjects, the decrease in the use of possessve nouns and concrete prepositional phrases suggests a shift from naming actors to the discussion of abstract entities, which academic prose tends to rely on.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that despite the shift towards more register-appropriate noun phrase use occurring in both groups, the group that received explicit instruction on complex noun phrases underwent more advanced development. First writers in the NP-I group increased their use of all modifiers (excet quantifiers), whil the Reg-I group displayed less consistency. There was a large efect size associated wit the overall increase of total modifiers in the NP-I group in comparison to small inthe Regroup. In terms of premodifier use, the NP-I group had a significant increase in the frequency of nouns, assciated with Stage 3 of syntactic complexity development. The Reg-I group demonstrated a decrease in nouns as premodifiers, and instead, the highest in. crease occurred only at tage 2 with attributive adjective. Finll, in the NP-I group, the frequency f features significantly increased at Stage 4 and 5, while no such changes were observed in the Reg-I group. Thus, the findings suggest that explicit instruction on complex noun phrases led to more frequent use of modifiers related to more advanced stages of syntactic development.

# 4.1.1. Effect of instruction on noun phrase structure frequency

The second part of the analysis aimed to identify whether explicit noun phrase instruction leads to more frequent use of complete complex noun phrases. Table 6 demonstrates descriptive statistics and results of the pared samples t-tests for the differences in the noun phrase use between diagnostic and final writing in the NP-I group. It can be observed that just as noun phrase modifiers, l types of noun phrases were used more frequentl n final writing. Sigificantly dfferent were results for noun phrases that contained simple premodification and for the total frequency of noun phrases. Effect sizes were medium for four types of structures (i.e., simple pre modificatin, simple postmodification, simple pre- and postmodification, and simple premodification with complex postmodification) and large for the total number of noun phrases. This demonstrates that in addition to using noun phrases with one modifier more frequently, the NP-I group started adding multiple modifiers before and after a head noun, thus packaging more meaning into noun phrases. t is important to acknowledge that despite medium eect sizes, some structures had quite low frequencies in thecorpora .g, simple premodification with complex postmodification in Table 6); therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting the results.

In the Reg-I group, however, only half of the specific noun phrase structures were used more frequently in the final writing with no significant diffrences (Table 7). While the total frequency of noun phraes incrsed from diagnostic to final writing, this change had a medium effect size in comparison to the large effect size seen in the NP-I group.

Fig. 2 demonstrates that both groups mostly relied on noun phrases that contained only one modifier. Interestingly, however, the Reg-I group commonly used nouns with simple premodification, while the NP-I group relied both on simple premodification and on simple postmodification in a more balanced way. This greater reliance on premodification within the Reg-I group was observed for complex modification as well The fourth most common category, noun phrases with simple pre- and simple postmodification, displays a trend observed previously with noun phrase modifiers: the groups' use of this type difered in the diagnostic writig but became similar by the end of the semester.

In summary, the reults reeal that both groups increase their totl usef complex noun hrases, but the effct sies differed: arge for the NP-I group and medium for the Reg-I group. For individual noun phrase structures, the magnitude of increase was also higher within the NP-I group. Considering the differences in effect izes it may be argued that explicit instuction on complex noun phrases led to more frequent use of these features.

# 4.2. Impact of prompts on the instruction effect

Considering that the two groups responded to diffrent sets of prompts and previous research showed that prompts may impact complexity feature use, it was important to determine whether the effect of instruction differed from the initil findings when the influence of prompts was reduced. The statistical results of the diffrences between the diagnostic and final writing with reduced prompt effects can be found in Appendix D. In the NP-I group, virtually no changes occurred ater noun phrase from a prompt were removed from student writing. This can be explained by the fact that both the diagnostic and final prompt contained only one complex noun phrase undergraduate students. As a result, the only difference was that the change in simple premodification lost it statistical significance, and the effect size slightly decreased (from $d = . 5 5$ to $d = . 4 2$ . Also, a small increase was found in the effect sizes for the total number of noun phrases (from $d = . 7 9$ to $d = . 8 1$

More noticeable efects of prompts were identified in the Reg-I group. First, the diffrence in attributive adjective use became significant with the considerably increased effect size (from $d = 0 . 4 3$ to $d = 0 . 6 8 \mathrm { \mathrm { ~ } }$ . This change may be due to the exclusion of the phrase major intnational sporting events that was a part of a diagnostic writing prompt. This phrase contains two atributive adjectives, which conribute to greater use of this feature in the initial analysis and thus to smallr differences between the diagnostc and final writing before it was excluded. Second, changes in the effect sizes for prepositions with concrete meaning (from $d = - . 4 3$ to $d = - . 2 1 { \dot { } } .$ - occurred due to the exclusion of fake news on Facebook/social media from the diagnostic. In terms of complete noun phrase use, the overall difference became significant with an increased effect size (from. $d = . 4 7$ to $d = . 5 9$ . In specific structural categories, effect sizes for simple premodification with simple postmodification changed from $d = - . 3 0$ to $d = . 0 4$ and in complex premodification from $d = . 3 2$ to $d = . 4 3$ The changes were due to the reasons explained above.

Fig. 2. Differences in the use of noun phrase structures by the NP-I group and Reg-I group.

Overall, theseresults demonstrate that prompts had an impact on the ffect of noun phrase instruction. I is worth noting, however, that despite some changes in significance and effect sies all trends within goups remained unchanged the increse in the features (i. e., modification types and noun phrase structures from diagnostic to final writing was preserved when prompt noun phrases were excluded. A simila trend was observed for features that decreased or remained table in the intial analysis. Therefore t ppears that hile wording from the prompts inluence the instruction effect for some feature, overall trends in differences of feature use from diagnostic to final writing remained the same.

# 5. Discussion

This study examined complex noun phrases in L2 writing within FYW courses and found that both groups, regardles of receiving explicit instruction, increase their use of thee features from dianosticto final writing. These reults support findings from previous Iongitudinal and cros-sectional research that documented greater reliance on noun phrases as writers progress in their development (e.g., Biber, Reppen, et al., 2020; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples et al., 2016) and that these changes may ocur within a short period of time (Bulte & Housen, 2014; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015). This study found, however, that the group that received explicit noun phrase instruction showed a greater shift towards register-appropriate use of these features.

First, while both groups increased the use of aributive adjectives associated with Stage 2 of syntactic complexity development, only the NP-I group had asignificant increase in nouns as premodifier (with a medium to large efect siz), associated with Stage 3.A similar developmental trend was found by Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) who compared pre-matriculated graduate students and enrolled MA students: $5 7 \%$ of all modifiers for EAP students were attributive adjectives, while the MA group relied more on other features, inudig extive use f nounsas prmodifier. milaly, ignficant incrase nnouns as rmodifiers t not atributive adjectives) was found in a longitudinal study examining the same universty students writing with a two-year interval (Biber, Reppen, et a., 2020). As previous research found the development in noun as premodifier use at more advanced academic levels, the findings of this study (i.e., asignificant increase of nouns as premodifiers in the NP-I group with a medium to large effect size) may suport the claim that explicit instruction had a positive efect on writers' shift towards more register-appropriate use of noun phrases.

Another modifier at Stage 3, possesive nouns, was also used with increased frequency in the NP-I group. In previous research, more frequent use of this modifier distinguished writing by MA writer from that of pre-matriculated students (Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014). This may indicate NP-I group's movement towards syntactically more advanced writing. While the Reg-I group's use of possessives decreased, it should be noted that this group's use was noticeably high in diagnostic writing. Thus, it could be argued that decreased use of posessives led to les frequent naming of human actors and relying more on abstract information, which could be evidence of register-appropriate use in the group that received no instruction. The use of possessives became similar in both groups in the final writing, suggesting that while the groups started at different point, explicit and implicit instruction led them to similar frequencies of use.

Another finding of this study is that the NP-I group increased their use of several modifiers at advanced Stages 4 and 5, while no such effect was found in the Reg-I group. One of these feature, prepositional phrases with abstract meaning (Stage 4) was found to distinguish a more advanced group in previous research (Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014). Another observation was that almost all features in the NP-I group that increased with small-to-medium or medium-to-large effect sies were compressed noun phrase except for noun complement clauses), while in the Reg-I group no such consistency was identified. The change in the NP-I group goes in line with Staple et al. (2016) who found that compressed noun phrases increased as university writers progressed through educational levels. These findings together with the fact the average frequency of nearly all modifiers for the NP-I group increased from diagnostic to final writing (while no such consistency was found in the Reg-I group) and that increas for total modifier use had a large efect size in the NP-I group and small in Reg-I may be considered aditional evidence for the effectiveness of explicit complex noun phrase instruction.

Apart from modification, complete noun phrases were also examined. The results indicate that the use of the majority of specific structural types increased in the NP-I group with medium effect szes in comparison to inconsistent changes in the Reg-I group. The NP. group demonstrated a balanced increase in pre- and postmodifiction (usedas single modfier or together with ther modifiers withn one noun phrase), while the Reg-I group increased premodification use only. The total use of noun phrases in the NP-I group underwent a significant increase with large effct sies in comparison to medium effect i inthe ther group. These differnces again point to a greater shift towards register-appropriate use of noun phrases within the group that received explicit instruction.

When prompt efects were minimized through the exclusion of prompt noun phrases, some impact was revealed for both groups, with more noticeable differences in the Reg-I group. These findings align with previous research that found that topics impact complexity feature production (Lan, Lucas, & Sun, 2019; Yang et al., 2015; Yoon, 2017). However, despite diferences in several modifiers or structural noun phrase types, overall trends in changes within each group remained unchanged. This suggests that while prompts had some effect on noun phrase complexity features (at least as it was operationalized in this study), other factors (e.g, minimum TOEFL scores, L1s, previous writing experiences) could have had a greater impact on the differences in developmental trajectories observed from diagnostic to final writing.

The findings overallpoint to the possibility that noticing noun phrase structures and functions in expert texts could have increased NP-I writers' awareness of the importance of these features and led students to incorporate more noun phrases into their writing. Controlled practice of clause-to-phrase transformations might have also encouraged deliberate experimentation with noun phrase structures that students rarely used before and as a result led to the expansion of writers repertoires of linguistic choices. Overall, the instructionseemed to contribute to the shift in student writig from relying on elaborated discourseto producing more compressed and information-dense prose.

# 6. Pedagogical implications

When considered together, the results of this study suggest that complex noun phrase instruction embedded throughout a FYW course may lead to a greater increase in noun phrase frequency and complext, and thus these findings support claims from previous research on the importancef integrating such instruction into 2 writing curricul. Therfore, the present study also recommends that L2 composition instructors consider including noun phrase-focused discussions and activities into their courses in order to support the syntactic complexity development of university-level writers. Introductory undergraduate writing courses may offer an appropriate venue for such instruction, but focus on noun phrases may be even more valuable for advanced undergraduate and especially graduate writers. Consulting theelements of instruction preented in this stud (se Appendix ) and other articles (Casal & Lu, 2021; Musgrave & Parkinson, 2014) may be the firs step for instructors or curriculum designers who wish to develop such activitie. It ems important to inform writers about the role that noun phrases play in academic writing complexity, discuss noun phrase structures and functions, provide opportunities for noticing and analyzing these features in model texts and student own writing, offer controlled clause-to-phrase transformation exercises, and encourage integrating noun phrases into students' writing. While the curriculum dis cussed in ths study did not focus on the relation of noun phrase modifiers to hypothesized developmental stges (Biber et al., 2011) and did not draw students attention to the importance of compresed noun phrases (Staple et al., 2016) discussing these topics with writers might help foster a more nuanced understanding of phrasal complexity in academic writing. This focus on form and functions of complex noun phrases may help writers meet the conventions of academic writing register more effectively.

# 7. Conclusion

The effect of explicit noun phrase instruction as a means of assisting writer in using them in a register-appropriate way were examined in the context of FYw courses. The results indicate that while some developmental trends were observed in the group that received no explicit instruction on noun phrases, a more consistent increase in the use of noun phrase modifiers and complete noun phrases was identified in the group that was instructed on the rol of noun phrases in academic discourse. This group also displayed an increased use of noun phrase modifiers associated with more adanced stages of complexity development and compressed noun phrases. When the effects of prompts were minimized, the overal trends within groups remained unchanged. Having empirically tested the validity of recommendations from previous research to integrate noun phrase instruction into writing curricula ths study confirms that such instruction may indeed benefit academic writers syntactic development at the phrasal level and lead to more register-appropriate use.

While this study was one of the first to test the validity of claims in previous research about the necessty of teaching complex noun phrases, it has several limitations. It is possible that differences in institutional contexts, other elements of instruction, minimum writing proficiency scores, 1 backgrounds, and topics might have had an effect on the results of the study. Future research should adopt a tre experimental design in which the efect of these variable i minimized as well s include a delayed post-test to determine Whether the impact of instruction has a long-term efect. It isaso possble that a developmental level may have an impact on student receptiveness to the instruction. For example, writers with lower-level English or writing proficiency might be les rcetive to complex noun phrase instruction or the opposite could be the case. More research i needed to determine how instruction on complex noun phrases impacts writing of students at other proficiency and educational levels and also with specific linguistic backgrounds. Another direction for future research is to test the effects of dierent types of complex noun phrase instruction. In this study, ful. semester instruction was implemented; however, it is also important to determine if shorter-term interventions could have a similar efect. Finally, as mentioned earlier in the study, this rearch foused on the frequency aspect of rester-appropriate use, but the functional dimension i.e., whether noun phrases were used in a functionally apropriate manner) should be explored in more detail. ogether these lines of reearch may advance our understanding of the viability and effectivenessof incorporating noun phrases instruction into L2 writing courses.
