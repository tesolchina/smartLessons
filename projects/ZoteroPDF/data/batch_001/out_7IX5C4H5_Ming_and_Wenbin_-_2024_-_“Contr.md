Academic disagreement is integral to knowledge construction in academic writing. The present study reports on a two-level analysis of academic disagreement in discussion sections from an integration of cross-linguistic and cross-paradigmatic perspectives. Based on a corpus of 80 applied linguistic research articles (RAs), this study examined whether functional components and engagement realizations of academic disagreement differed between Chinese and English RAs and between quantitative and qualitative RAs. Results demonstrated that English RAs negotiated with alternative views more often than Chinese RAs. Quantitative RAs more frequently settled academic disagreement with detailed explanations or supportive evidence than qualitative RAs. Chinese qualitative RAs differed markedly from other RA groups. These differences were attrib utable to culturally preferred discursive strategies, paradigmatically valued epistemological norms, and socially oriented views of the scientific approach. This study sheds light on how to implement interpersonal strategies to manage scholarly disagreement in different varieties of academic writing.

# 1. Introduction

Academic writing is not an objective and impersonal form of argument that demonstrates absolute truth, but a subjective and personal form of discourse in which academics recognize, construct and exchange social relations (Hyland, 2005). This inherently involves a persuasive endeavor to negotiate academic disagreement (AD) and legitimize the new research within the disciplinary community. AD is, therefore, an essential aspect of knowledge-making in applied linguistics. It enables writers to update established knowledge schemata and make an original contribution to the community. Also, it requests them to strategically resolve the tension between the present findings and the prior ones, maintain harmonious interpersonal relationships with disciplinary members, and elicit readers’ positive responses to the new knowledge (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016; Sadeghi & Alinasab, 2020).

Surprisingly, despite its prominent role in scholarly writing, much of the literature has merely regarded AD as constitutive of rhetorical moves/steps in discussion sections (e.g. Nwogu, 1997; Yang & Allison, 2003; Liu & Buckingham, 2018) and examined its distribution in academic writing across genres (Basturkmen, 2009), disciplines (Basturkmen, 2012; Kanoksilapatham, 2015), languages (Ahmadi, 2022), and paradigms (Ash’ari et al., 2023). In contrast, few studies have taken AD as a separate rhetorical act responsible for knowledge construction (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016; Thompson, 1993). Of these studies targeting AD, some have described its functional components and analyzed the engagement resources mapped onto the components in RAs of applied linguistics (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016), while others have investigated the cross-linguistic differences in its functional components between English and Persian RAs (Sadeghi & Alinasab, 2020). Nonetheless, little evidence is available as to how Chinese and English writers negotiate AD with strategic manipulation of engagement resources and confer authority on the new findings. Even less is known about whether Chinese and English writers in quantitative and qualitative research varied in disagreement negotiation and rhetorical practices.

In this context, drawing on a revised framework in Cheng and Unsworth (2016) and the engagement framework in Martin and White (2005), the present study undertook a two-layer analysis of AD from an integrated perspective of language and paradigm. It compared the functional components of AD and their engagement realizations in Chinese and English quantitative and qualitative RAs of applied linguistics. By doing this, this study provides suggestions for novice writers to develop their expertise in using engagement markers to represent and reconcile AD in accordance with the linguistic and paradigmatic conventions.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Previous studies of Chinese and English RAs

The literature on Chinese and English RAs can be broadly divided into two categories. One line of research has applied Swalesian genre analysis (Swales, 1990, 2004) to scholarly publishing and compared the distribution of rhetorical moves and their linguistic realizations in the abstracts, introductions and discussions in Chinese and English RAs (e.g. Deng et al., 2024; Loi & Evans, 2010). For example, Loi and Evans (2010) examined the similarities and differences in text organization between Chinese and English RA in troductions. They found that, except for reviewing literature/findings of previous research and raising a question, Chinese introductions used fewer rhetorical steps than English counterparts, indicating distinctive rhetorical traditions and cultural norms of the two languages. First, Chinese writers avoided raising a critical voice to establish research niches because of the Confucian principle of “zhongyong (i.e. the constant mean)”. Second, there was a relative lack of explicitness in defining the terms, presenting the research background, and announcing the research purpose in Chinese introductions, which reflects high-context communication and reader-responsible awareness. Third, Chinese writers were reluctant to claim the centrality of their research, since it violated the principle of humility in the teaching of Confucius.

Another line of research has investigated the distribution of interpersonal resources in Chinese and English RAs based on the analytical frameworks of appraisal theory (Martin & White, 2005) and metadiscourse (Hyland, 2005). It is revealed that Chinese and English writers, affected by sociocultural factors, varied in their deployment of appraisal and metadiscursive devices (Li & Xu, 2020; Mu et al., 2015; Xu & Nesi, 2019b), including hedges and boosters (Chen & Zhang, 2017; Hu & Cao, 2011; Yang, 2013), author self-reference (Chen, 2020), engagement markers (Hu & Wang, 2014; Xu & Nesi, 2019a), rhetorical hypes (Jiang, 2023), etc. For example, Hu and Wang (2014) examined the variations of engagement markers in Chinese and English journals. They found stronger dialogic expansion in English than in Chinese RAs, as evidenced by the more frequent use of engagement markers in general and acknowledgement in specific in the English RAs. This might be related to the opposing views of language as a vehicle for declaring knowledge in Chinese versus constructing knowledge in English. However, as an exception to this generalization, Chinese RAs featured a less frequent use of contest to contract the dialogue due to the cultural orientations towards face-saving acts and interpersonal rapport. Likewise, Xu and Nesi (2019a) reported the same dialogic expansion and contraction pattern in introductions and conclusions of English-medium RAs by native writers of Chinese and English. There was a higher incidence of entertain in the former but a greater number of endorse in the latter. Additionally, English native writers showed a stronger preference for counter and deny and their combinations with entertain to fend off alternatives and simultaneously open up the dialogue space for opposing views.

# 2.2. Previous studies of quantitative and qualitative RAs

Parallel to the cross-linguistic research is an increasing interest in cross-paradigmatic differences in rhetorical choices to under stand how distinct epistemological norms influence knowledge-making practices in academic writing. The rhetorical features concerned in these studies include interactive metadiscourse (Cao & Hu, 2014), interactional metadiscourse (Hu & Cao, 2015), surprise markers (Chen & Hu, 2020), hedges and boosters (Liu & Tseng, 2021), structural organization (Ash’ari et al., 2023), etc.

For example, the studies by Cao and Hu (2014) and Hu and Cao (2015) have yielded significant differences in metadiscursive use between quantitative and qualitative RAs. With regard to interactive metadiscourse, quantitative RAs used comparative and inferential transitions, non-linear references, sequencers, and reformulators more frequently than qualitative RAs. This was related to epistemological assumptions underlying the two research paradigms (Cao & Hu, 2014). That is, quantitative research is predominated by a (post)positivist epistemology that aims to uncover universal causality, while qualitative research is undergirded by a constructivist and interpretative epistemology that purports to provide contextualized understandings of participants’ personal experiences. To this end, quantitative research reduces abstract human and social phenomena to a small set of variables and establishes causal relations between the variables. Therefore, comparative and inferential transitions were more often in quantitative research to compare results with hypotheses and make causal generalizations. Also, the establishment of universal laws required more reformulators to elaborate on the arguments and limit their generalizations in quantitative research. Additionally, numerical information of the variables was usually presented in tables, and these variables led to empirical results organized in linear sequences, so non-linear references and sequencers were more frequent in quantitative RAs. With regard to interactional metadiscourse, it was revealed that quantitative RAs deployed substantially more hedges, boosters, attitude markers and directives than qualitative RAs (Hu & Cao, 2015). A possible explanation might be that quantitative research hinged on statistical analyses to infer causal relationships. This inferential nature of causal re lations called for more hedges and boosters to modulate the strength of knowledge claims, more attitude markers to comment on the research results regarding whether they (dis)confirm hypotheses, and more directives to refer to tabular data or introduce mathe matical models. Similarly, in a frame-based analysis of surprise markers, Chen and Hu (2020) found that qualitative researchers tended to describe who felt surprised (i.e. Experiencer), while quantitative researchers preferred to explain and resolve the surprise (i.e. Explanation and Resolution), in the case that surprise arose from the conceptual incongruence between the current findings and the research hypotheses. This might be explained by the fact that interpretivism or constructivism highlights detailed descriptions of participants’ attitudes or behaviors and underscores the need to initiate the inquiry without specific hypotheses, whereas (post) positivism takes hypotheses derived from previous studies as the point of departure and places emphases on whether, or to what extent, research findings (in)validate the hypotheses.

However, these results were at odds with the findings of Ash’ari et al. (2023), who compared rhetorical organization and meta discursive markers in qualitative RAs with those in quantitative RAs in prior research. They found that qualitative research had a larger proportion of interactive markers to organize the text, and it displayed a higher frequency of self-mention and engagement markers to involve readers and build rapport with them. In addition, they identified marked differences in rhetorical steps in RA discussions. That is, interpreting the results was more often in the qualitative RAs, whereas comparing results with the literature was more frequent in the quantitative RAs.

# 2.3. Previous studies of AD

AD,1 generally conceptualized as situations in which knowledge claims stand in contrast with those in previous studies (Salager-Meyer, 1999; Thompson, 1993), makes significant contributions to academic knowledge generation (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016). It has been operationalized in the literature in two ways: (i) considering it to be constituents of rhetorical moves in discussion sections (Nwogu, 1997; Liu & Buckingham, 2018; Yang & Allison, 2003), and (ii) projecting it as an isolated rhetorical act with delicate mechanisms at play during the composition process (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016; Sadeghi & Alinasab, 2020; Thompson, 1993). Accordingly, empirical research on AD can be classified into two strands.

One has conceived AD as rhetorical units related to indicating non-consistent observations and explaining specific research moves (Nwogu, 1997), commenting on results move (Basturkmen, 2009, 2012; Yang & Allison, 2003), or consolidating results move (Kanoksilapatham, 2015) in the discussion sections. This research strand has investigated the distribution of the rhetorical moves and their lexico-grammatical features in RAs across genres (Basturkmen, 2009), disciplines (Basturkmen, 2012; Kanoksilapatham, 2015; Lim, 2010), languages (Ahmadi, 2022) and paradigms (Ash’ari et al., 2023).

The other research strand has been concerned with functional and interpersonal realizations of AD as a subtle rhetorical act in L1 and L2 academic writing. Thompson (1993) identified three functional constituents of AD, namely proposed claim (PC), opposed claim (OC) and disagreement resolution (DR). PC indicates a specific result yielded in the study. OC represents a prior result in sharp contrast to the present finding. DR refers to the justification for the conflict. Cheng and Unsworth (2016) complemented Thompson’s (1993) framework and proposed a fourth component, i.e. inconsistency indicator (II), to signal contrastive relations between the present study and the prior ones. More importantly, they described the distribution of engagement markers across the four functional components, and they found that PCs were principally realized by deny and pronounce to highlight the value of the current finding. OCs were mainly instantiated by acknowledge, deny and counter to introduce the alternative voice and accentuate its tension with the present finding. DRs were mostly composed of entertain to discuss reasons for the empirical discrepancy. Based on this modified framework, Sadeghi and Alinasab (2020) found significant differences in AD, II and DR between English and Persian RAs, attributing these variations to the larger number of contrastive markers in English and a lack of genre-based instruction for Persian writers.

Altogether, the aforementioned studies have offered important insights into the ethnolinguistic and epistemological influences on rhetorical strategies in academic writing, and they have greatly extended our knowledge about the structure of AD in RAs. However, much uncertainty still exists in the literature. First, few cross-linguistic studies of move structures have been conducted in discussion sections between Chinese and English RAs. Even less contrastive research between the two languages can be found regarding the use of engagement markers in the highly complex argumentative pattern involved in presenting and negotiating AD. Second, the extant literature has focused on cross-linguistic and cross-paradigmatic variations of linguistic choices in a largely discrete fashion. This research practice, though effective in controlling for extraneous variables, raises questions as to whether paradigmatic and ethno linguistic variables work in tandem to influence academic rhetoric. Therefore, the present study carried out a contrastive analysis from a unifying language-paradigm perspective. Third, the analytical framework in Thompson (1993) and Cheng and Unsworth (2016) was based on rhetorical analyses of English RAs. Its applicability to Chinese academic writing awaits further investigation. Therefore, this study did not strictly adhere to the established framework in data analysis, but tried to be flexible so as not to rule out any variation in

the RA corpora.

To bridge the gaps identified above, this study seeks to examine cross-linguistic and cross-paradigmatic variations of AD in terms of its functional components and engagement markers employed to signal the components. The classification of the functional compo nents and engagement markers will be detailed in Section 3.3.

# 3. Research design

# 3.1. Research questions

This study intends to answer the following two research questions:

(1) What are the differences in the functional components of AD in discussion sections between Chinese and English RAs and between quantitative and qualitative RAs?   
(2) What are the differences in the engagement markers across the functional components of AD in discussion sections between Chinese and English RAs and between quantitative and qualitative RAs?

# 3.2. Corpus description

To address the two research questions, we sampled Chinese and English RAs in applied linguistics with a particular focus on second language acquisition. This subfield was chosen for two reasons. First, previous studies have demonstrated significant rhetorical variations across subfields of the same discipline (Triki, 2021; Hyland & Jiang, 2022). Therefore, it would be essential to separate lan guage effects from disciplinary ones and concentrate on a single subfield. Second, as applied linguists regularly exposed to RAs in leading Chinese and English journals, we possessed the knowledge of rhetorical conventions of applied linguistics. This might be beneficial for data coding.

We attempted to ensure the tertium comparationis (Connor & Moreno, 2005) between Chinese and English journals. The Chinese journals contained Foreign Language Teaching and Research, Foreign Languages and Their Teaching, Modern Foreign Languages, and Foreign Language World, while the English journals included Modern Language Journal, Language Teaching Research, Applied Linguistics and TESOL Quarterly. The equivalence between the two subcorpora was achieved at two levels. First, the Chinese and English journals were listed in the Chinese Social Science Index and Social Science Index, respectively. Therefore, they represented the leading academic journals in the two languages and published the best applied linguistic research in each community. Second, both groups embraced the same amount of quantitative and qualitative research. The research methods were determined with reference to data collection and statistical methods in the reported studies (Hu & Cao, 2015). Then, with a stratified random sampling strategy, we separately selected 20 quantitative and 20 qualitative RAs from English and Chinese journals published from 2017 to 2023.

For the selected RAs, we manually removed their titles, abstracts, tables, figures, notes, and references and kept the post-method sections only (Yang & Allison, 2003). Table 1 presents the descriptive information about the subcorpora.

# 3.3. Analytical frameworks

The present study adopted two analytical frameworks to examine the functional components of AD and their concomitant engagement markers. The former roughly follows Cheng and Unsworth’s (2016) model with necessary revisions so that it is well suited to our samples, while the latter is informed by the engagement system within appraisal theory (Martin & White, 2005).

AD in this study, similar to that in Cheng and Unsworth (2016), consists of four functional components: PC, OC, II and DR. PC is referred to as the new finding, OC as the conflicting finding in the literature, II as the linguistic device signaling contradictory viewpoints, and DR as the justification for the contrastive findings. Nonetheless, slightly different from that in Cheng and Unsworth (2016), DR in this study falls into seven subcategories. These subcategories constitute a continuum ranging from dialogic expansion to restriction, among which four lean towards the dialogically expansive end of the continuum (i.e. No DR, Negative evaluation of PC, Positive evaluation of OC and Explanation), while three tend towards the dialogically restrictive end (i.e. Alignment with literature, Positive evaluation of PC and Negative evaluation of OC). Specifically, No DR leaves AD as it is, so this strategy makes dialogic space for competing voices without suppressing positions on both sides (Example 1).

Negative evaluation of PC acknowledges the limitations of the present study and communicates the writers’ intention to underscore the contentious status of the current knowledge claims, thereby opening up the dialogic space for the alternatives (Example 2).

(2) These findings are in contrast with previous studies (Van Beuningen et al., 2008; 2012). [Negative evaluation of PC Given that our design did not include … our data does not allow us to offer firm conclusions …].

Positive evaluation of OC indicates that the current results partially support the previous findings rather than entirely refute the previous research, so the dialogic space remains expansive (Example 3). Explanation often attributes the contradictory findings to the differences in research methodology, so it launches no attacks on the validity of the present or previous research and makes the dialogic space for all those possibilities (Examples 3).

(3) [Positive evaluation of OC In line with … previous studies focusing on … adults (Azkarai & García Mayo, 2015 …), these children did not make an excessive use of …]. However, … these children employed their L1 more frequently than adults … (Azkarai & García Mayo, 2015 …). [Explanation The differences … might be due not only to … but also to …].

Alignment with literature establishes connections between the proposed study and previously established knowledge. This rhetorical choice isolates OC from the intellectual resources in the community, so it implicitly jeopardizes the legitimacy of the OC and restricts the dialogic space to some extent (Example 4). Positive evaluation of PC justifies the current claim as a significant contribution to the field and provokes readers’ positive reactions to the new knowledge. This practice disadvantaged the opposed study by undermining its value, reducing the dialogic space for the alternative voice (Example 4). Negative evaluation of OC represents that writers criticize the opposed study for their inadequacies or weaknesses, so it closes down the space for dialogic alternatives (Example 5).

(4) These findings refute Truscott’s (2007) contention that …, a significant [Positive evaluation of PC expansion] of Lalande’s (1982) conclusion that … Our contention … is that … [Alignment with literature This proposal is in line with views of some SLA researchers … (e.g., Bitchener & Knoch, 2010b …)].   
(5) [Negative evaluation of OC However, given the methodological issues in many studies resulting in a bias in favor of explicit instruction … (VanPatten, 2014)…]. In contrast to … literature on this topic … the student teachers in the present study were …

The engagement system is helpful to account for the authorial stance to PCs and OCs in the argumentation process of negotiating AD. It deals with linguistic resources that dialogically engage with multiple voices in an expansive or contractive manner (Martin & White, 2005). Specifically, contraction is grouped into two categories of disclaim and proclaim, while expansion is categorized into attribute and entertain. Disclaim includes two subcategories of deny and counter, both restricting the scope of dialogistic alternatives by rejecting or supplanting them. Proclaim is classified into three subcategories, i.e. concur, pronounce and endorse. Concur construes a putative reader who is overtly announced as agreeing with the writer. Endorse communicates the writer’s stance as supportive of external sources. Pronounce constructs the authorial voice as correct, valid or undeniable. Entertain is an expansive category that recognizes the writer’s voice as one among other positions in the community. Attribute, consisting of acknowledge and distance, dis associates the authorial voice from the cited proposition. Acknowledge takes a neutral position and makes no explicit evaluation of what is being cited, whereas distance detaches the writer from the responsibility for the attributed material.

English engagement markers in the corpus were identified based on Martin and White (2005: 92–135). However, Chinese engagement markers were obtained from three sources of information, given that there has been no accessible inventory in the literature. First, we translated as many English engagement markers as possible into Chinese equivalents. Second, considering that not all rhetorical devices can be translated from one language into another (Hu & Wang, 2014), and one-to-one correspondences cannot always be established between English and Chinese markers, we referred to the literature on hedges, boosters, and reporting verbs to expand the wordlist of Chinese markers. This was because, according to Martin and White (2005), various terminologies were traditionally used to designate entertain, including “epistemic modality”, “evidentiality”, “modals of probability”, “interpersonal metaphor” (p. 105), “modal auxiliary”, “modal adjunct”, “modal attribute”, “mental verb/attribute project” (p. 106), “hedge” (p. 108), etc. Attribute is commonly termed “communicative process verbs”, “mental process verbs” (p.111) and “reporting verb” (p. 112) and endorse is associated with the notion of “factivity” (p. 126). Third, in cases where the coding category was hard to determine, we consulted Chinese linguists to make the final decision. The engagement subcategories were instantiated in English and Chinese in Table 2.

# 3.4. Data analysis

AD components and engagement markers were identified and annotated manually in NVivo 12. To minimize the subjectivity of manual annotation, we invited a graduate student familiar with the engagement system to participate in data coding and establish inter-rater reliability. After a training session, the first author and the student drew upon the analytical frameworks to independently identify the functional components and engagement markers for AD in the 80 RAs with NVivo 12. The average kappa coefficient for reliability across all nodes and sources was 0.86. Then, the two coders settled the disagreement by discussing the nodes in question and revising their initial coding.

We built the generalized linear model (GLM) in SPSS 23, using the Poisson distribution in particular, to compare linguistic (i.e. English versus Chinese) and paradigmatic (i.e. quantitative versus qualitative) effects on the frequencies of functional components and engagement markers in our analytical frameworks. This statistical method was chosen for two reasons. First, none of the dependent variables was normally distributed, as revealed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ , but they were shown to have a Poisson distribution $( p > 0 . 0 5 )$ . Second, not all RAs included the complete set of functional components or engagement markers, with one or more of them absent in many RAs. Thus, the dependent variables were discrete rather than continuous data bounded at zero, which made the Poisson model (as opposed to the linear model) fit in with our corpus analysis. Notably, for the independent variables in our statistical analyses, English and quantitative paradigm were set as reference variables for the language and the research paradigm, respectively.

# 4. Research findings

# 4.1. Functional components of AD

Table 3 shows that mean frequencies differed significantly across languages or paradigms for most functional components. The following section will demonstrate the inferential results and provide instances in our corpus whenever necessary.

Based on the GLM with Poisson distribution in Table 4, statistical analyses uncovered similar patterns of AD, OC, PC and II, with a significant main effect of language and paradigm. The interaction between language and paradigm was significant in the cases of AD and PC. As Table 4 presents, the interaction was partly because the qualitative RAs exhibited greater variation of AD and PC between the two languages $( p < 0 . 0 1$ ; $p < 0 . 0 1$ ), compared with the quantitative RAs $\scriptstyle \mathtt { \mathtt { P } = 0 . 3 9 9 }$ ; $p = 0 . 2 5 7 \mathrm  _  \it$ , and partly because Chinese RAs showed considerable cross-paradigmatic differences in AD and PC $( p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; $p < 0 . 0 1 $ ), but English RAs lacked such variation $_ { ( p = 0 . 2 7 2 }$ ; $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 4 6 0 } $ ). This reflects that English writers managed and resolved AD more frequently than Chinese writers, and quanti tative RAs contained significantly more AD to transform current findings into generalized knowledge claims than qualitative RAs.

Regarding DR subcategories, Alignment with literature, Explanation, and Positive evaluation of PC displayed high frequencies in the RA corpus. However, the frequency of Negative evaluation of PC was relatively lower. This coheres with Cheng and Unsworth (2016) and lends support to their claim that explicit dismissal of the opposed studies was not a preferred strategy for applied linguists to resolve AD. Instead, they legitimized their claims by crafting connections with the existing scholarship or unraveling reasons for the discrepancies to mitigate face-threatening criticisms.

Furthermore, comparative analyses of Alignment with literature yielded a significant main effect of language and a significant main effect of paradigm. Also, there was a significant interaction between language and paradigm. The interaction resulted from larger cross-linguistic variance in qualitative RAs $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ than quantitative ones $( p = 0 . 7 3 2 )$ and greater cross-paradigmatic variation in Chinese RAs $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ than English counterparts $( p = 0 . 6 0 2 )$ . This suggests that English RAs, compared with Chinese ones, exhibited a stronger tendency to connect with prior studies as a common strategy to reconcile AD. Additionally, compared with qualitative RAs, quantitative RAs preferred showing consistency with the existing scholarship as an indicator of fitting into the disciplinary network. The statistical analysis conducted for Explanation detected a main effect of paradigm. This indicates that quantitative RAs, in contrast to qualitative RAs, tended to attribute empirical discrepancies to contextual variations and validate the new research through elaborated explanations. Results demonstrated a significant main effect of language on Positive evaluation of PC. This is indicative of English writers’ strategic inclination to assign positive value to the proposed study and thereby strongly advocate the new findings.

# 4.2. Engagement markers across functional components

Table 5 presents the mean values of engagement markers across the four functional components of AD in our corpus. The distri bution of engagement markers in this study aligns with those found in Cheng and Unsworth (2016). That is, PC had a frequent co-occurrence with entertain and pronounce. OC was mainly characterized by acknowledge and endorse but was rarely combined with counter and deny. II was principally realized by counter, such as however, although, but, etc. DR was closely linked to various engagement resources, including entertain, acknowledge, endorse, pronounce, deny and counter.

These results indicate that applied linguistic writers tended to use entertain or acknowledge to take a neutral account of their research results or the opposed findings (Example 6), and employ pronounce to assert their claims (Examples 6 and 7). Also, on some occasions, these writers deployed endorse to report and warrant previous claims in support of the current one (Example 7). Addi tionally, they were disposed to use entertain to provide possible explanations for the inconsistencies (Examples 8 and 9), employ disclaim (i.e. deny and counter) to illuminate the differences in research design (Example 8), and choose pronounce to announce the contextual variations as accredited facts in explanations (Example 9).

However, unlike Cheng and Unsworth (2016), this study found that deny infrequently occurred in PC and II, and distance rarely appeared in OC. One plausible explanation might be that contrastive markers in Cheng and Unsworth (2016) were subsumed under the umbrella of deny, while they were not in the present study. The textual analyses showed that deny was commonly against putative readers (Example 10), and distance usually misaligned the authorial voice with the cited proposition (Example 11). Therefore, their infrequent occurrences in the corpus indicate that Chinese and English writers avoided fending off the possible alternative views or contracting the discourse to maintain a harmonious social relationship. This aligns with the research findings in Section 4.1.

The following section reports the statistical differences in engagement markers between English and Chinese RAs and between quantitative and qualitative RAs. Table 6 illustrates a significant main effect of language and paradigm on the frequency of entertain, and a significant interaction between language and paradigm. The interaction arose from the greater variation between English and Chinese RAs in qualitative RAs than in quantitative RAs. That is, English qualitative RAs used entertain markedly more frequently than Chinese equivalents $( p < 0 . 0 1 )$ . This is not true of English quantitative RAs $\scriptstyle ( p = 0 . 1 3 1 )$ ). GLM yielded a significant main effect of paradigm on acknowledge, indicating a markedly higher frequency in quantitative RAs than in qualitative RAs. The GLM run on endorse showed a significant main effect of language and paradigm, and a significant interaction between the two. The interaction occurred because while there is no significant linguistic variation in the quantitative RAs $( p = 0 . 6 3 9 )$ ) nor paradigmatic difference in English RAs $( p = 0 . 3 8 4 )$ , qualitative RAs displayed much cross-linguistic variation $( p < 0 . 0 1 )$ , and Chinese RAs showed significant crossparadigmatic variation $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ . Furthermore, there was a significant effect of language on pronounce, indicating that English RAs featured more pronounce than Chinese RAs. A significant main effect of paradigm was also found, suggesting that quantitative RAs resorted to considerably more pronounce when reporting AD than qualitative RAs. The GLM on deny found a significant main effect of language, revealing a drastically higher frequency of deny in the English RAs than in the Chinese RAs.

# 5. Discussion

The above results have revealed that English RAs used more AD, II, PC, OC, DR subcategories (i.e. Positive evaluation of PC and Alignment with literature), entertain, endorse, pronounce and deny than Chinese RAs did. Quantitative RAs used AD, II, PC, OC, DR subcategories (i.e. Explanation and Alignment with literature), acknowledge, endorse and pronounce more frequently than qualitative RAs did. There was a significant interaction between language and paradigm in using AD, PC, Alignment with literature, entertain and endorse.

# 5.1. Ethnolinguistic influences

There was more frequent use of AD, II, OC and PC in English RAs than in Chinese RAs, indicating that English writers attached more importance to addressing and confronting contrary positions when partaking in knowledge construction. These results mirror those from cross-linguistic analyses of hedges and boosters (Chen & Zhang, 2017; Hu & Cao, 2011; Yang, 2013), engagement markers (Hu & Wang, 2014; Xu & Nesi, 2019a, 2019b), metadiscourse (Li & Xu, 2020; Mu et al., 2015), etc. These studies have concluded that English writers have a stronger predilection for expanding the dialogic space and enhancing interpersonal communication with external voices than their Chinese counterparts.

This identified discursive preference might partly be attributable to the distinct Anglo-American and Chinese rhetorical norms. Anglo-American rhetorical conventions, originated from Socratic and Aristotelian philosophical traditions, viewed language as a medium of constructing knowledge rather than telling knowledge. This rhetorical belief values a critical stance towards received knowledge, encouraging intellectual inquiry in adversarial modes and engaging in verbal argumentation as a major tactic to generate knowledge (Hu & Cao, 2011). The cultural practices thus dispose English writers to anticipate counterarguments, pinpoint experimental discrepancies or inconsistent findings, and eventually negotiate AD. This thus led to a remarkably higher frequency of AD in English RAs. This result is similar to the findings in Gao (2016) that English RAs used more adversative linking adverbials (i.e. however, on the other hand) to challenge earlier points than Chinese RAs. Furthermore, the need to address opposing views induces English writers to capitalize on entertain to recognize their epistemic claims as one against the heteroglossic backdrop in the current communicative context, thus making the dialogic space for other positions. This finding corroborates the marked preferences for entertain in RA introductions and discussions written by English writers in Xu and Nesi (2019a). It also supports Chen and Zhang (2017), who reported infrequent use of the “I/we $^ +$ non-factive verb” structure (corresponding to entertain) to hedge the concluding statements in the English RAs by Chinese writers. Additionally, this higher level of dialogic expansion in English RAs also increases the demand for rhetorical engagement with viewpoints from the literature, so there was a higher frequency of Alignment with literature in English RAs as a common DR strategy. This account is supported by results from Hu and Wang (2014), who found a higher density of engagement markers in English RAs than in Chinese RAs.

In contrast, Chinese rhetorical practices, rooted in Confucian and Taoist philosophical precepts, were characterized by the prev alent belief that truth is self-evident without the necessity for proof or explanation (Hu & Wang, 2014). These beliefs manifest themselves in Confucian quotes that “I transmit the old truth and do not originate any new theory” (述而不作) (Gu, 2017, p. 134), and “language should be intelligible and nothing more” (辞达而已矣) (p. 350). They are also reflected in Lao Tzu’s words that “Trusty speech is not embellished; Embellished speech is not trusty” (信言不美, 美言不信) (Ryden, 2008, p. 167). Under the influence of such cultural beliefs, Chinese rhetorical norms demonstrate respect for essential knowledge, discourage verbal debate or argumentation, and pay little attention to alternative positions. Accordingly, Chinese writers were less obliged than English writers to communicate with external voices or leave room for counterclaims by mitigating their claims.

However, several findings run counter to the dialogic expansion and contraction pattern identified above. The first exception was that Chinese RAs used remarkably less dialogically contractive pronounce to assert the proposed claims. This might be ascribed to the highly valued ethos of humility in Confucian teaching. That is, “a moral man” (君子) should uphold principles of “deference (humility) $( \ddagger \grave { \ast } )$ , consideration for others (宽), trustworthiness (信), diligence (敏) and generosity (惠)” (Gu, 2017, p. 384). Accordingly, this cultural emphasis on humility hindered attempts to construe the authorial voice as an undeniable fact in Chinese RAs. It also reduced the need for Chinese writers to highlight the value of their work, so Positive evaluation of PC was less frequent in Chinese RAs than in English RAs. These rhetorical practices, functioning as self-denigrating strategies, enabled Chinese writers to avoid the perception of arrogance, create a socially desirable public image of modesty, and eventually foster harmony within the academic community (Chen, 2024). This result is consistent with the findings from Loi and Evans’ (2010) contrastive analysis of rhetorical steps of Chinese and English RA introductions. They demonstrated that claiming centrality, presenting positive justification, and claiming the significance of the study accounted for a larger proportion in Chinese introductions than in English equivalents, reflecting Chinese writers’ reluctance to stress the contribution of their research. Also, it attests to the findings from Xu and Nesi (2019b) that British writers were more likely to express their attitudes towards the research than their Chinese writers in English-medium journals.

The second exception to the broad pattern is Chinese RAs’ infrequent use of dialogically contractive deny. This could be explained by Chinese politeness strategies geared toward avoiding confrontation with other viewpoints and considering the face needs of others, with the ultimate goal of maintaining harmonious relationships (Chen, 2024). These social norms would prevent Chinese writers from refuting epistemic claims by other disciplinary members in order to attenuate the interactional tension and develop a friendly rela tionship with them. This result chimes with those in earlier contrastive analysis (Hu & Wang, 2014; Xu & Nesi, 2019a). Hu and Wang (2014) found a lower frequency of contest citation by Chinese writers, and Xu and Nesi (2019a) uncovered a higher incidence of deny and counter as the rebuttal of objections from putative readers in English RAs. Also, it agrees with the findings from Loi and Evans (2010) that Chinese introductions used rhetorical steps of indicating a gap and counter-claiming to a lesser degree than English introductions did, suggesting Chinese writers’ avoidance of using pejorative expressions to highlight inadequacies of previous studies.

The third exception to the general pattern is that Chinese RAs used significantly less dialogically contractive endorse. This finding contradicts those from earlier studies. For example, Hu and Wang (2014) identified comparable frequencies of endorse in English and Chinese RAs. Xu and Nesi (2019a) produced a higher frequency of this subcategory in Chinese RAs. This exception might be an artefact of the significant differences in Alignment with literature between English and Chinese RAs. The greater number of this DR subcategory enabled English writers to use endorse to represent the cited proposition as authoritative, lending credence to the current claims. This interpretation attests to the findings in Xu and Nesi (2019a) that British writers, compared with Chinese writers, were more likely to proclaim shared opinions.

Notably, as one of the anonymous reviewers pointed out, the above exceptions to dialogic contraction in Chinese RAs might also be explained by the influence of knowledge-making practices prevalent in the Western community. That is, due to consistent exposure to academic papers published in internationally renowned journals, Chinese writers might incorporate English rhetorical conventions into their Chinese academic writing. We agree that this balanced approach, i.e. a combination of cultural and professional influences, might provide a more plausible explanation for our findings.

# 5.2. Paradigmatic influences

Quantitative RAs used AD, PC, II, OC, Explanation and Alignment with literature more often than qualitative RAs. This indicates that quantitative RAs showed a stronger tendency to negotiate with dialogistic alternatives by explaining empirical discrepancies and maintaining solidarity with those in different positions. Also, they were more inclined to craft connections with prior research whose positions align with those advanced in the current study. This result resembles recent studies of rhetorical structures in qualitative and quantitative RA discussions. That is, Liu and Buckingham (2018) found that comparing results with literature occupied a larger pro portion in the cyclic pattern of reporting and commenting on results in quantitative RAs, whereas Ash’ari et al. (2023) demonstrated that interpreting the results showed a higher frequency in the move sequence in the qualitative RAs.

These differences might arise from the distinct epistemological assumptions underlying quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative research is governed by a (post)positivist epistemology that seeks to establish general laws of causation (Cohen et al., 2018). For this purpose, quantitative research favors a reductionistic approach to narrow human behaviors and social phenomena into discrete variables. Then, it establishes causal relations between the variables in a strictly controlled experimental environment by adopting standardized procedures and valid assessment instruments. It finally testifies the research hypotheses with empirical results to produce conclusive or generalizable findings. As such, the (post)positivist epistemology calls for a dialogue with the existing literature to ensure the generalizability of the current findings. By contrast, qualitative research is shaped by a constructivist and interpretivist epistemology that intends to provide an empathetic description and contextualized account of participants’ experiences in a particular social setting and how they understand their experiences. Informed by the epistemological norms, qualitative re searchers use ethnographic methods such as observation and elicitation to collect and analyze data without predetermined categories or explicit hypotheses (Seliger & Shohamy, 1999; Cohen et al., 2018). Consequently, this would eliminate the need for qualitative RAs to articulate distinctions between the current and prior studies, evaluate literature-derived hypotheses, and assess the generalization of results across contexts.

Furthermore, the higher incidence of Explanation suggests that quantitative researchers are more likely to resolve AD through elaborated explanations, which might be caused by the pursuit of universal laws of causality sanctioned by the (post)positivist epistemology. Specifically, researchers tended to account for the contradictions between the present study and the previous research regarding contextual constraints, as illustrated in Examples 8 and 9. In this way, they identified methodological factors leading to the inconsistencies and delimited the scope of generalizations for subsequent replications. Also, the ultimate goal of uncovering generalized causal relations motivated quantitative researchers to establish connections with well-established knowledge claims and guarantee the reliability of their claims. Thus, there was substantially more Alignment with literature in quantitative RAs than in qualitative RAs. These findings largely accord with those from a cross-paradigmatic analysis of surprise markers (Chen & Hu, 2020). They reported that qualitative RAs, compared with quantitative RAs, were less likely to resolve the surprises resulting from the conceptual incongruence between priori hypotheses and research results.

In addition to functional components, engagement markers, including pronounce, acknowledge and endorse, varied considerably between quantitative and qualitative RAs. First, pronounce, which functions to strengthen the writers’ arguments, had a frequent cooccurrence with PC in quantitative RAs. Its higher incidence could be attributed to the fact that (post)positivist epistemology renders researchers sensitive to what tables showed, what statistical analyses demonstrated, and whether research results proved hypotheses (Hyland, 2005). These epistemologically determined discursive practices increased the need to strengthen the PCs with pronounce. This result aligns with Hu and Cao’s (2015) finding that quantitative RAs used significantly more boosters to apprise readers of great certainty than qualitative RAs did. Second, the combination of acknowledge and OC was more prevalent in quantitative research. This result might reflect the reliance of quantitative research on inferential statistics to extrapolate whether the observed results hold true (Cohen et al., 2018). By contrast, although concrete causal processes in qualitative research are inseparable from the writers’ sup positions or inferences, these results are indeed derived from the researchers’ detailed descriptions and interpretive accounts of the participants’ thoughts, behaviors and experiences, rather than from prediction based on the statistical data (Hu & Cao, 2015). This probabilistic nature of causal relations in quantitative research, therefore, prompts researchers to employ more acknowledge to construe the opposed study as one possible dialogic option and reduce their commitment to the proposed result. Third, quantitative RAs made extensive use of endorse combined with Alignment with literature, as compared with qualitative RAs. This engagement tactic enables researchers to align disciplinary members with their explicitly stated positions and situate readers within a community of shared values, thus adhering to the (post)positivist principle of pursuing universal truth.

# 5.3. Interaction between ethnolinguistic and paradigmatic influences

Results revealed a significant language/paradigm interaction effect on AD, PC, Alignment with literature, endorse and entertain. Specifically, all the five categories were considerably less frequent in Chinese qualitative RAs than in English quantitative RAs. The former four were substantially fewer in Chinese qualitative RAs than in Chinese quantitative RAs. This means that Chinese qualitative RAs differed drastically from their English and Chinese counterparts regarding disagreement management.

Apart from the ethnolinguistic and paradigmatic influences mentioned above, these sharp distinctions between Chinese qualitative RAs and other RA groups might arise for three other reasons. First, it might emerge due to the divergent epistemological beliefs prevailing in the applied linguistic community in China and the West. That is, the former is dominated by (post)positivism despite an increase in the number of qualitative studies in recent decades, while the latter undergoes a gradual shift from (post)positivism to constructivism or interpretivism (Gao et al., 2001; Hu & Wang, 2014; Wen & Lin, 2016). Consequently, many scholars in China seem unfamiliar with or even hostile to the qualitative method. They often give negative comments about the “small sample sizes”, “lack of representativeness”, “subjective interpretation”, and “verbosity” of qualitative research (Wen & Lin, 2016: 850). Second, the quali tative method is inherently complex since it is an umbrella term for a range of different methods, including narrative inquiry, grounded theory, case study, ethnography, phenomenology, etc., each of which holds different philosophical assumptions and has distinct research foci (Liu & Tseng, 2021). It also requires researchers to engage in time-consuming processes of data collection and tran scription, identify recurrent patterns from extensive data sets, and iterate through cycles of observation and analysis before reaching conclusions (Seliger & Shohamy, 1999). This immense complexity poses methodological challenges for the researchers to conduct qualitative research in their scholarly publishing. In addition, qualitative research as a cognitively demanding task presupposes that researchers devote more time, energy and resources to the empirical inquiry. This might lead to an imbalance between research costs or practicalities and scientific productivity, and cause the researchers to lose interest in the approach, especially when they are under tremendous pressure to “publish or perish” in the increasingly competitive academic world (Hyland & Jiang, 2019). Third, numerous Chinese teachers lacked sufficient expertise in qualitative methodology. This knowledge deficit hindered their ability to provide effective instruction in qualitative research methods to graduate and postgraduate students (Wen & Lin, 2016). This further affected how these novice writers addressed and resolved AD in qualitative academic writing, leading to departures from international aca demic conventions. These factors contributed to the stark contrast in disagreement negotiation between Chinese qualitative RAs and their Chinese quantitative or English qualitative equivalents.

# 6. Conclusion

This study demonstrated several cross-linguistic and cross-paradigmatic differences in enacting functional components and handling interpersonal resources in disagreement representation and resolution. First, English RAs were more likely to negotiate with conflicting views than their Chinese counterparts. They tended to elevate the status of their proposed claims by identifying their similarities with the existing body of literature, explaining empirical discrepancies, and assigning positive values to their claims. Similarly, to draw generalizable conclusions, quantitative RAs were more interested in settling AD than qualitative RAs with detailed explanations or supportive evidence for the current study. Second, compared with Chinese RAs, English RAs were characterized by their more frequent use of pronounce to assert the proposed claims, entertain to accommodate other voices or account for the in consistencies, deny to negate the opposed claims, and endorse to support previous findings agreeing with their own. Likewise, different from qualitative RAs, quantitative RAs relied more on pronounce to strengthen their proposed claims, acknowledge to eliminate the established academic status of the opposed claims, and endorse to align with the literature. Third, Chinese qualitative RAs differed considerably from their Chinese and English equivalents. These differences could be ascribed to the interplay of such factors as culturally preferred discursive strategies, paradigmatically valued epistemological assumptions, and socially oriented views of the scientific approach.

The present study provides pedagogical suggestions for EAP writing classes. First, the study found significant cross-linguistic and cross-paradigmatic variations in rhetorical structure and interpersonal realization of AD. Thus, it is necessary for EAP instructors to perceive AD management as a situated rhetorical practice that should be implemented or taught in relation to specific cultural and paradigmatic contexts. Second, the revised coding scheme in the present study provides a useful tool to advance EAP instructors’ understanding of how AD is negotiated with strategic choices of engagement markers within quantitative and qualitative RAs of applied linguistics. Third, the current findings can serve as a base for EAP instructors to develop teaching materials and tasks with a particular emphasis on AD resolution. For example, the instructors could assign consciousness-raising tasks to novice writers to facilitate their understanding of inter-cultural and inter-paradigmatic differences in response to academic discrepancies. Also, they could sensitize the novice writers to the various engagement markers as overt argumentation strategies used to manipulate authorial stance in disagreement negotiation. These tasks could include comparative analyses of model texts in class, with the help of instructors to explain possible reasons for the identified differences. Additionally, the novice writers could be equipped with corpus tools to inform their academic writing by observing how AD is structured and expressed in RA corpora.

Notwithstanding these interesting findings, some limitations need to be considered. First, this study undertook a cross-linguistic and cross-paradigmatic analysis of the functional components and engagement realizations of AD in a corpus of 80 RAs in applied linguistics. Future studies could increase the sample size to ensure the generalizability of our findings. Second, this study concentrated on AD in applied linguistic RA discussion sections, since discussion is the main venue for academic dialogues (Nwogu, 1997; Liu & Buckingham, 2018; Yang & Allison, 2003). However, except for the discussion sections, AD might occur in the literature review where contradictory findings are synthesized or divergent theoretical positions are distinguished (Chen & Li, 2019; Lim, 2012). Also, it might figure in the research methodology where the research design in the present study may differ from that in the prior ones (Lim, 2006). Therefore, future studies might offer a more comprehensive view of AD by examining its use in other generic structures of RAs. Third, despite the great efforts to ensure comparability between English and Chinese RAs, it remains questionable whether the two RA groups differ in their research quality and intended readership. These differences might contribute to the cross-linguistics variations observed in this study. This is a research area that remains to be elucidated.
