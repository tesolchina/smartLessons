# Enacting identity in microblogging through ambient affiliation

Michele Zappavigna University of New South Wales, Australia

# Abstract

This article explores how we use social media to construe identities and align with others into communities of shared values. The focus is on how ‘users of language perform their identities within uses of language’: How do personae using the microblogging service Twitter perform relational identities as they enact discourse fellowships? Addressing this question means understanding how personae enter into ambient affiliation. Such affiliation is ambient in the sense that social media users may not be interacting directly, but instead participating in mass performances of hashtagging or contributing to iterations of Internet memes. This article will consider three key bonds (self-deprecation, frazzle and addiction) using both a 100 million-word corpus of posts and a smaller specialized corpus collected by capturing the entire Twitter stream of a particular user.

Microblogging, the act of posting short character-constrained messages to the Internet, has become a prevalent communicative practice for construing identity. It is currently receiving much scholarly attention due to the lens that it provides on mass, real-time expression of opinion and sentiment about both public events and domestic life. While previous work on microblogging personae has concentrated on professional identity, branding and micro-celebrity (Gilpin, 2010; Marwick, 2011; Page, 2012), this article focuses on the personal domain, considering the kinds of personae that are enacted as microbloggers make ‘the ordinary visible to others’ (Oulasvirta et al., 2010: 238), posting about their quotidian experiences. The aim is to understand how microbloggers as ‘users of language perform their identities within uses of language’ (Martin et al., 2013). I will investigate such ‘identity work’ (Benwell and Stokoe, 2007) from the dual perspective of ambient1 affiliation (how social bonds are configured in order to commune with a mass online audience) and ambient identity (how these bonds are realized as particular discursive patterns of collocative values that characterize different microblogging personae).

Exploring forms of ‘networked identity’ (boyd and Heer, 2006) is currently an area of inquiry within a range of disciplines that have an interest in computer-mediated communication and the structure of online social networks (Androutsopoulos, 2006; Papacharissi, 2010; Thurlow and Mroczek, 2011). Within sociolinguistics a body of work has recently begun to develop considering how identity is construed in social media texts (Seargeant and Tagg, in press), focusing on language variation and variables such as gender, ethnicity and style (e.g. variation in emoticon use; Schnoebelen, 2012). This work builds on earlier approaches2 to identity in interaction within offline contexts outside the social media domain (e.g. Campoy and Espinosa, 2012; Coupland, 2007; Eckert, 2000; Hyland, 2009; Jaffe, 2009; Knight, 2010).

Complementary to this focus on identity is the long-standing interest both within and outside linguists in the shared communicative strategies that might characterize communities of language users, variously theorized as ‘discourse communities’ (Bizzell, 1992) and ‘communities of practice’ (Wenger, 1998).3 As an object of study, microblogging offers a rare opportunity to the linguist to track the particular configurations of shared social bonds that are involved in construing group memberships. In part, this is because the brevity enforced by the medium goes some very small way towards reducing complexity, and because the affordances of the channel mean that we can collect large volumes of textual interactions that give us insight into linguistic disposition.4 This gives us some ability to gain a window on what Firth refers to as the ‘general language of the community’ that governs each person’s ‘command of a constellation of restricted languages’ (Firth, 1968: 207). In addition, as we will see, the affordances of the channel (such as search5 and aggregation of posts via metadata) mean that microbloggers engage in self-classification practices associated with social tagging (Trant, 2009) and generation of profile descriptions (Ellison and boyd, 2013).

This article will begin by introducing the concept of ambient identity. The two microblogging corpora used in my reasoning about this form of identity, LUCIA (a single user’s Twitter stream) and HERMES (a 100 million-word randomized Twitter corpus), are then detailed. These corpora are used to explore how discursive patterns of values make visible patterns in social relations as complexes of ‘bonds’.6 I then detail the particular model of evaluative language that is used to analyse how values are negotiated in posts. Focusing on a complex of three key bonds manifest in the two corpora, I will investigate how microbloggers construe an experience of semiotic belonging as they enact ambient identity.

# Ambient identity

This article seeks to augment existing linguistic accounts of identity in interaction by suggesting the role of ‘ambient’7 forms of communion that occur with social media use. This form of online fellowship is ‘ambient’ in the sense that it does not necessarily presume direct interaction between participants (Zappavigna, 2011). While microbloggers may use social media platforms such as Twitter to engage in conversation-like exchanges between individuals, they will often simply be talking about the same topic at the same time. They may draw on shared communicative practices that have a solidarity-invoking function within the ‘networked public’ (boyd, 2010) such as mass performances of hashtagging8 (where shared topics are marked with a hashtag (e.g. #parenting), a form of metadata) or contributions to iterations of Internet memes (media such as catchphrases, image macros or video that spread virally via the Internet9).

Hashtags are a form of metadata that can be used to indicate the ‘aboutness’ of a post but, as we will see, they also play a role in performing identity. These tags set up an attributive relationship10 between the tweet as a tagged token and the label as its type. For example, the hashtag in the following post indicates that the post is about ‘Follow Friday’, a practice whereby microbloggers promote other accounts they deem worthy of attention:

I’ve just noticed that hardly anyone does #FF any more. I think we all have a little #FF fatigue

The tag assigns a keyword (FF) to the post in the form of metadata referencing its ‘topic’ (in a non-technical sense). This ‘tag as type’ relationship assumes that other users will also adopt this tag in posts about the same subject.

Appending a hashtag presupposes that a post has an ambient audience who may share or contest the values construed by the accompanying verbiage. This interpersonal orientation arises from the main function of microblogging: proposing bonds to a set of followers (or wider ambient audience). For example, consider the shared experience of parenting invoked in the following HERMES posts that include a #parenting tag:

A successful parent will honor & support their child’s journey through life ..NOT try to control it. #parenting #Loa

Lady Gaga Barbie dolls by Lu Wei Kang…weird! http://bit.ly/abqNfI What good #parent would ever buy this half-naked “toy”? #ugly #parenting

D’oh! while I am out here organizing my digital life, my son is elbow deep in the toilet, learning how the flush works. #parentingfail

Whoa, eye-opening. RT $@$ GaryBrannigan Do you give your child THINGS in place of your TIME? There’s no comparison! #parenting

As we will see, posts of this kind both enact parenting identities and invite communion around the daily experience of parents.

# Communion of feeling

My focus on affiliation in relation to identity is inspired by Firth’s (1964: 112) suggestion that ‘promotion, establishment, and maintenance of communion of feeling is perhaps four-fifths of all talk’. Sharing feeling is central to both fostering social interaction and communicating the values that signify who we are. A Firthian perspective on microblogging sensitizes us to the ways in which microblogging texts propose social ‘bonds’ to their ambient audience in order to invite such communion of feeling. Malinowski (1972) foregrounds similar ideas in his concept of ‘phatic communion’ where the main communicative function of a discursive interaction is interpersonal. A related interpersonal function has been explored by Coupland (2000) with reference to ‘small talk’ such as gossip and conversational ‘keeping in touch’.

For example, the main function of the following post is not ideational (letting the world know that the microblogger’s child is asleep) but interpersonal (sharing positive affect about the experience of motherhood):

mu lil one just fell asleep in my arms..she hasnt done that in awhile..i love being a mom

Similarly, the post below by Lucia, when viewed as part of an ongoing prosody of light self-mockery in this microblogger’s Twitter feed, can be seen to have a largely interpersonal function inviting communion of sentiment:

Just spilt wine on son’s homework diary. #badmother

While this post does function at one level to inform the ambient audience about a minor event in the microblogger’s domestic life, it also interpersonally aligns the ambient audience around a humorous shared experience of parental inadequacy. This interpersonal function is marked by the self-deprecating hashtag ‘#badmother’. The hashtag playfully classifies the microblogger as failing to live up to a parenting ideal by acting as a kind of conversational aside that connects this post with a putative collective of other inept parents. We will return later to the self-deprecation bond marked by this tag. The point that I wish to introduce here is that identity is critical to the interactive, phatic and affective communion that we see enacted in microblogging despite popular depictions of microblogging as a form of navel-gazing. In other words, identities are social even as they are personal (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005; Zimmerman, 1998).

As well as interactional and relational, identities are semiotic in the sense that a persona will tend toward enacting particular patterns of values in discourse (Bednarek, 2010; Bednarek and Martin, 2010). For example, patterns of emotional language are involved in enacting attitudinal or expressive identity (Bednarek, 2011, in press). Groups of personae form discourse fellowships as they converge (or diverge) around these evaluative patterns. Thus we require what Halliday (1978) refers to as a ‘social semiotic’ perspective to account for, not only the ways in which identity is construed in discourse, but also for how that construal both affords and influences different forms of sociality. While this article will focus on the meanings made by a particular user in a single microblogging stream (compared with more general patterns in a reference corpus), I do not wish to suggest that enacting identity is most productively thought of in terms of individual people. Instead, if we adopt a perspective focused on meaning in its social context, we are interested in how personae are performed in discourse:

As Firth warns, it is not psycho-biological entities we are exploring, but rather the bundles of personae embodied in such entities and how these personae engender speech fellowships. We’re not, in other words, looking at individuals interacting in groups but rather at persons and personalities communing in discourse. (Martin, 2009)

The interpersonal dimension of meaning inflects the personae that we adopt in social life, just as the kinds of roles that these personae can take up is modulated by the genres into which we have been socialized (Martin and Rose, 2008).

# Microblogging corpora used in this study

Before further outlining the perspective on ambient identity adopted in this article, I will begin by detailing the corpora employed, since texts taken from these corpora will be used illustratively throughout the sections that follow. Two corpora were used: HERMES, a 100 million-word corpus of microposts, and LUCIA, the entire microblogging stream of a particular user who writes about her experiences of motherhood in a well-known South African blog. This user offers the following self-description in the profile field of her stream:

Mother, author, blogger and baby-maker. The Queen of Everything.

The aim of employing these two corpora is to focus both on local patterns found in a particular microblogging stream and on more global patterns manifest in a reference corpus. Both were created using the Twitter application programming interface (API)11 to extract tweets from the microblogging service. In order to ensure that HERMES contained only English tweets, posts with non-English characters were removed from the corpus, and a statistical language model written in pearl (Simões, 2010) was used to further filter out non-English tweets. LUCIA is a form of diachronic corpus, that is, a corpus where the time at which texts are collected is a significant variable. The corpus creation period was a time-restricted interval designed to capture all posts by this microblogger from the date she commenced using the service (6 January 2011) until 6 March 2013. This resulted in a corpus of 58,241 words and 3717 posts. The following is an example of a post from Lucia’s stream:

Clare:12 Mom, you aren’t allowed to say ‘fukken’ hey? Um, yes. You aren’t allowed to say fukken. OMG!!! Bad mother, bad.

HERMES consists of over 100 million words13 and close to 7 million tweets (Zappavigna, 2012). It contains randomized tweets based on the algorithm used by

Twitter for sampling what is referred to as the ‘garden hose’ feed, a subset of the larger global stream of tweets. An example of a common pattern (the most common 3-gram) found in the HERMES corpus is the three-word cluster, THANKS FOR THE. This pattern often occurred when members of Twitter thanked each other for retweeting a post (the rebroadcasting of a user’s tweet in another user’s stream, sometimes with appended commentary) or for mentioning them. The following post expresses gratitude for a retweet:

@User Hi – thanks for the RT. Much appreciated :)

As this tweet suggests, microblogging is a highly interactive practice in which interpersonal meaning (here expressing gratitude) plays an important role.

# Negotiating shared values in discourse

The particular model of evaluative language used to explore discursive values in the microblogging posts is known as Appraisal (Martin and White, 2005) and was developed within systemic functional linguistics. The perspective on affiliation and identity developed in this paper was also developed within the same linguistic tradition (Bednarek and Martin, 2010). Evaluation is an important resource for construing solidarity:

Feelings are meanings we commune with, since we do not say what we feel unless we expect the person we are talking with to sympathize or empathize with us. We express feelings in order to share them . . . to build relationships; where we misjudge the situation and get rebuffed, then a sense of alienation sets in. (Martin, 2002: 196)

According to the Appraisal model, the discourse semantic system of attitude14 is a domain of interpersonal meaning where language is used to express emotions and opinions. Appraisal represents attitudinal meaning15 as a choice between affect (expressing emotion), judgement (assessing behaviour) and appreciation (estimating value). This choice is shown in Figure 1 as a system network,16 that is, a network of interrelated options that are organized paradigmatically, in terms of ‘what could go instead of what’ rather than syntagmatically in terms of structure (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004: 22). The examples in this network shown in the boxes are taken from the LUCIA dataset. Each example illustrates a type of attitude and the network may be further specified to greater levels of delicacy depending on the kind of analysis for which it is being used. The braces in this network represent an ‘and’ relation. For example, as shown, ‘love’ is coded as attitude that is inscribed and of positive valence.

Depending on the target and source of the evaluation, lexis such as ‘good’ can work within any of the attitude systems. Consider judgement working along moral parameters targeted at behaviour in the following tweet:

Thank god is the weekend, time off for good behaviour and affect construing emotion:

Figure 1. The attitude system illustrated with examples from LUCIA (adapted from Martin and White, 2005).

I feel really good, finally reached the 1,000 followers who wanted both!!

or appreciation expressing aesthetic assessment about an entity:

Got to have some best friend time tonight, pack a few boxes and drink some good wine. Going to bed content.

While most work drawing on Appraisal has considered language use, Martin and White (2005: 203) suggest that the model might also be used for studying language users by exploring the ‘syndromes of evaluation which characterise an individual – their appraisal signature’ where such a signature represents ‘the idiolectal reconfigurations of meaningmaking potential by which individual authors achieve a recognisable personal style’ (Martin and White, 2005: 208).

# Proposing bonds to an ambient audience

Investigating the configurations of bonds enacted by microbloggers involves identifying the values discursively negotiated in posts. This in turn involves considering not only patterns of evaluative language, but also the relation between appraisal patterns and patterns of experiential meaning (i.e. what is the text taking a stance about?). In other words, it requires understanding the unfolding collocation or ‘coupling’17 of these two forms of meaning in discourse. ‘Coupling’ refers to a concept introduced by Martin (2000) and taken up by Zhao (2010, 2011) and Zappavigna et al. (2008) for looking at textual relations that involve ‘the temporal relation of ‘‘with’’: variable $x$ comes with variable $y '$ (Zhao, 2011: 144). As this definition suggests, coupling is a generalization across semiotic dimensions of the notion of collocation or colligation18 used in corpus linguistics. An example is the positive evaluation of a particular day of the week in the following post (attitude in bold, ideation underlined):

Good morning campers! Monday morning and I am up at sparrows fart, ready to do my thing. I love Mondays!

Following the notation adopted in Martin et al. (2013), we can represent the coupling in the above as: [ideation: Mondays/evaluation: affect], keeping in mind that only inscribed evaluation (that is, evaluation explicitly realized in lexis) is represented here. The positive assessment construes a controversial value and appears to also introduce a play frame (Bateson, 1972) when viewed against the proliferation of posts complaining about Monday mornings in HERMES, such as the following:

Good morning!! Sooooo tired, hate mondays esp when I have to go get paperwork from office before going to set bc I’m an idiot!!blah!!

This post inverts the polarity of evaluation seen in the example of coupling taken from LUCIA.

The analytical sections of this article which follow will consider both localized clusters of bonds (realized as patterns of collocative values) at the same time as exploring how these bonds are inflected by more general memberships across different communities (e.g. posts by users referring to their gender and religion).

# Enacting quotidian bonds

The bonds shared in LUCIA are predominantly realized as values related to routine, domestic domains of experience. This section explores a complex of three bonds activated in this quotidian context: a ‘self-deprecation’ bond, an ‘addiction’ bond, and a ‘frazzle’ bond. As we will see, this bond complex is deployed across different kinds of communities (from geeks to parents) and is involved in marking different kinds of generational and religious affiliations.

# The ‘self-deprecation’ bond

Admitting fallibility through humour (Holmes, 2000), a politeness strategy for maintaining face19 (Brown, 1987), appears as a recurrent pattern across different microblogging communities. Within the sample of texts analysed in this paper it is used to enact solidarity via a ‘self-deprecation’ bond realized in discourse humorously dismissing a putative out-group persona. For instance, humour was employed in both LUCIA and HERMES to present an imagined subject position in conflict with the central values of being a parent (an example is the gendered bad mother bond addressing the normative value of caring for children shared by this community):

Table 1. Laughing off invoked self-judgement (neglect of child) in HERMES with a self-deprecation hashtag.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Invoked judgement (target = carer)</td><td>Example</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PROPRIETY (mistreatment)</td><td></td><td>Wat an awkward way 2 sleep but this is how he sleeps the longest lol #badmommy http://tweetphoto.com/1 1810749 Haha, that Bodyform song on Youtube just woke the</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">PROPRIETY (lack of attention)</td><td>2</td><td>toddler on my lap #badgranny. @mollyscarroll user oh baby, I have stories... #badparent</td></tr><tr><td>3 4</td><td>oops! been paying so much attention to benny&#x27;s top</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>teeth i didn&#x27;t even notice I coming in on the bottom! #badmomaward Kids &amp; I are at Robson Sq getting ready to see the Mascots</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>on Ice show.

He&#x27;s not dumb. Just wanted to</td></tr></table></body></html>

We can read this as ‘laughing off’ (Knight, 2010) or lightly and irreverently mocking the stereotype of a ‘perfect mother’ (Lopez, 2009), especially in the context of Lucia’s tendency to explicitly present herself as someone who does not conform to gender norms (e.g. by frequent use of expletives).

HERMES contained many examples of a self-deprecation bond marked by hashtags such as #badmom, #badmommy, #badmama, #badgranny and #badparent (Table 1). These hashtags are clearly skewed in terms of the gender they evaluate, and it is telling that there were no examples of tags such as #baddaddy.20 The hashtags can be seen to mark invoked negative judgement (shown in italics in Table 1) of the carer (mother, parent or grandparent) and, interestingly, the admitted ‘transgressions’ are often accompanied by examples where the parent shows diligent behaviour at the same time, suggesting preoccupation with status within the community. The judgement construed centres on three discourse semantic domains of apparent parental neglect: mistreatment (e.g. shutting a child in a closet), lack of attention (e.g. failing to realize a nappy change has been missed) and lack of care (classifying child as stupid).

![](img/c79b4221532c0cee21b6063e95f9ad0bb55af3cec1f9f1dea2ef1942e4d952b7.jpg)  
Figure 2. An example of a hashtag in a Twitter exchange.21

Playing upon the typical function of a hashtag as a form of conversational metadata, these tags act like a kind of metacomment or an aside. Importantly, they also invoke the possibility that there are other ‘bad mothers’ out there. In this way, what might function in a face-to-face conversation as a whispered aside, here seems to increase the semiotic ‘loudness’ of the label. Twitter’s search function returns many instances of this tag, for example the interaction between two users shown in Figure 2. This example involves two mothers humorously dismissing their own potential neglect of their children via negotiating invoked (e.g. suppose I’d better feed/bathe/ clothe my kids) and inscribed (e.g. #badmother) negative judgement of their performance as mothers.

As we have seen, the presence of a hashtag appears to activate a ‘play frame’ (Bateson, 1972) that invites a humorous reading of the apparent misdemeanour. For example, a play frame is inscribed via Haha in example 2, Table 1. This is not a humour of word play or wit, but rather a kind of conversation-like humour where an aberrant bond is jokingly dismissed. It is similar to the kind of ‘laughing off’ via actual laughter in conversation noted by Knight (2010). This form of laugher occurs when interactants are sharing a value (e.g. enjoyment of overeating) incommensurable with another value that they also share (e.g. appreciation of being thin). In the microblogging examples, behaviour that contravenes the putative norms of the parent/carer/mother community (attentive care of children) creates what Knight (2010) refers to as a ‘wrinkle’, a semiotic misalignment between competing bonds, in this case between bonds relating to parental care and to neglect (and their attendant good/bad mom personae). As mentioned earlier, we can interpret this as mocking the idea of a ‘perfect mother’. Genuine rallying around a shared bond of ‘neglect’ would be too confronting for this community and so aberrant as to prevent communion altogether.

Examples of more general laughing off of religious and gender norms in HERMES are shown in Table 2, involving hashtags such as #badjew, #badcatholic and #badgirl. More domain-specific fellowships were also marked, for example technology-related fellowship of the kind usually labelled as the domain of ‘geeks’.22 These posts usually draw upon technical lexis (marked in italics below) to further indicate group membership:

@user I bought it the day it was released, still haven’t beaten it! Also have R&C sealed. #BadPS3Owner

Checking in for flight to #MVP10 via Delta site and IE8 not good when I get a JScript error w/ “Print Boarding Pass” #badprogrammer

Thankfully the old member section allows me to change e-mail address lets see if that works. #easyjet #badwebdevs

Familiarity with the technicality signals group membership and the level of ‘involvement’23 instantiated.

Some posts in HERMES deploy a hashtag to mark self-deprecation relating to more general affective relationships such as friend:

$@$ user ACK! that was you! SHIT! I forgot! #badfriend and that was this morning. I was on my work phone when it rang

or romantic partner:

Kind of slept on the whole valentines day thing. #badboyfriend

These self-targeted hashtags are different from instances where the tag is used to cast judgement on an out-group (Tajfel, 1970) failing to meet some standard, for example:

Just working with the ugliest code that I ever saw! An utility that makes everything more complicated… $\scriptscriptstyle { . > < }$ #badprogrammers

You should not have your baby on 6th street at midnight, no matter what. #BadParent

The communicative convention could also be parodied by using an improbable hashtag, for example:

$@$ user How are they doing that, though their evil vibes coming from their horns? #badunicorns whowishthey’dbeonBudweiserads

In this example there is clearly no putative community of unicorns-who-wish-they’d-beon-Budweiser-ads being invoked, and instead the ambient audience is invited to laugh at (as opposed to laugh off) the tag, perhaps with reference to previous exposure to the kinds of tags surveyed in this section.

# The ‘addiction’ bond

The self-deprecation bond as realized in LUCIA co-occurred with what I will term an ‘addiction’ bond. Both LUCIA and HERMES contain instances of this bond that was enacted as personae rallied around items used regularly in daily life, such as coffee, wine and technology. Comparing LUCIA with HERMES, wine was a keyword24 identifying it as a fruitful place to look for realizations of the addiction bond:

The spirit is willing, but the flesh is hot, sleep-deprived and in need of some Chardonnay.

Mid afternoon concentration span fail.

Need. Wine.

These posts manifest the collocative value [ideation: wine/evaluation: affect (desire)] and celebrate wine as a form of parental panacea. As we have seen, wine was also involved in construing the self-deprecation bond in posts by Lucia such as:

Just split wine on son’s diary. #badmother

The addiction bond realized by the above posts is an example of a bond that leverages the special power of ‘iconization’ to produce an ‘interpersonal charge’ (Martin and Zappavigna, in press; Stenglin, 2008). Iconization involves the practice of rallying around bonding icons (e.g. flags, cultural symbols and heroes) that invoke shared feeling (e.g. patriotic feelings) and infuse particular values into the semiotic experience of fellowship. The microblogger in the above posts is rallying around wine as a domestic bonding icon. Related examples include Zappavigna’s (in press) exploration of the kind of communion invoked in Twitter posts about coffee such as the following, where coffee, as a domestic bonding icon, acts as a device for unification with an ambient community of coffee-drinkers:

Got my morning cup of #coffee, ready to start my day off!

The concept of iconization, as understood in this context, is a semiotic process whereby interpersonal meaning is condensed and ideational meaning discharged. In other words, it foregrounds the interpersonal (coffee as solidifying relationships) and backgrounds the ideational (coffee as a beverage).

Posts about addiction to coffee or, in the case of LUCIA, about wine, are not just relaying ideational content, they are proposing interactive bonds. Rather than simply informing other users that the microblogger has consumed a cup of coffee or a glass of wine (or used an iPad), the main function of the post is to propose a bond positively valuing the bonding icon. The addiction bond is sometimes marked with a hashtag, though appending a hashtag is not a prerequisite for proposing a bond:25

I hate waking up at 6am everyday. Ughh #needcoffee

An example of microbloggers negotiating values realizing a shared addiction bond is shown in Figure 3. This is part of a longer Twitter exchange involving three mothers discussing giving up wine during pregnancy. In this example the interactants negotiate a [ideation: wine/evaluation: negative affect (longing)] collocative value (affect shown in bold, ideation about wine underlined). In a similar manner to the selfdeprecation bond, the addiction bond appears to centre upon humorously dismissing an aberrant value. However, here the focus appears to be more on laughing off shared weakness (e.g. lack of fortitude in needing coffee or wine to cope with parenting) rather than laughing off contravening a community norm. In both cases the bonds enacted are also inflected by gendered discourses about parenthood and what constitutes adequate (judgement: social esteem: capacity) and appropriate (judgement: social sanction: propriety) behaviour (for exploration of parenting discourses about fatherhood, see Sunderland, 2006).

# The ‘frazzle’ bond

A common bond realized in LUCIA and HERMES in posts about parenting is the ‘frazzle’ bond. This is a bond relating to a shared experience of fatigue or exasperation experienced by engaging in the core activity of a particular community of fellowship. As with the self-deprecation and addiction bonds, this bond appears to be generalizable across different kinds of communities rather than specific to discourse about parenthood; however, larger quantitative studies are required to confirm this assertion. In terms of microblogging about parenting, the frazzle bond was often realized in hermes posts that were concerned with negotiating values associated with the sleep-deprivation associated with caring for a young child who sleeps poorly at night. The most common collocative value was [ideation: reduced sleep/evaluation: negative affect (dissatisfaction)/negative appreciation]. This pattern was manifest in LUCIA (affect in bold, appreciation underlined) as follows:

What a spectacularly horrendous night. Max awake for 3 hours, wanting “iPad! IPAD!!” I think NOT baby. Then twins snuck into bed $@$ 4am. Ugh

![](img/273f988a3ad9accf46d9fed6014e5db9580b080f7bc662356499d266e85bf933.jpg)  
Figure 3. A Twitter exchange negotiating the value [ideation: wine/evaluation: negative effect (longing)].

The above post proposes a quotidian bond that is regularly shared by parents: a communal experience of the frustrations of sleep-deprivation (a common theme of parentfocused Internet memes). Correspondingly, the value [full night of sleep $^ +$ positive affect (desire)/positive appreciation] was seen in posts realizing the frazzle bond in HERMES:

My daughter slept through the whole night last night! I’m probably more excited about this than our album release on __, ___, 2010

Life is good when your newborn sleeps through the night. \*Yawn\*

Interestingly, the same kind of bond is shared in posts about technology-related activities by apparent geeks:

I have been installing apps, creating app IDs and profiles for a client all day. Good thing I had the day off! #tired @iphonedeveloper

I’ve been coding all day, wish I could throw in the towel but now I have to get back to another project.

Getting ready to go to bed after a long night of coding up some custom classes to handle xml parsing and database interaction.

The function of the frazzle bond appears related to affirming that one is performing the particular community membership with appropriate gusto. For example, in the case of parenting this appears to constitute being sleep-deprived due to providing high levels of care to a child, and, within a tech community, it appears to involve being sleep-deprived due to staying up all night writing code.

Particular bonds may inflect differing configurations of values, depending on their host community. For example, within tech communities we do not see the level of selfjudgement seen in the parenting community. Within the former the self-deprecation bond is realized in discourse as a pattern similar to what has been labelled ‘humblebragging’ (Wittels, $2 0 1 2 ) ^ { 2 6 }$ by microbloggers. In other words, it is related to construing a positive public self-image without violating politeness norms by proclaiming one’s personal value too directly (Brown, 1987). Being addicted to technology, tired due to staying up all night coding, and a bad geek because one generated an esoteric error in a script are in fact highly valued positions allowing a persona to classify themselves as ‘such a geek’ (Zappavigna, 2012).

# Conclusion

This article has shown how identities can be thought of as patterns of bonds when approached in terms of the social relations that they enact – and as patterns of values when approached in terms of the meanings that they negotiate in discourse. It is in this sense that we can view ‘persons and personalities as active participators in the creation and maintenance of cultural values’ (Firth, 1957: 186). While the term negotiation that I have used throughout suggests deliberate activity, the practices at work always involve a tacit dimension since a language user does not usually consciously attend to their linguistic choices (Polanyi, 1983; Zappavigna, 2013); nor are they typically aware of the patterns of bonds that they play in an interaction.27 The approach I have adopted in exploring these patterns of bonds is aligned with Martin et al.’s (2013) suggestion that social bonds can be seen to ‘cluster as belongings of different orders’.28 This perspective recognizes that identities are patterns of meaning inflected by membership in networks of fellowship that dispose personae to enact particular configurations of bonds. I have explored a particular complex of bonds realized in both a single user’s posts and a larger randomized corpus.29

I will conclude with the following exchange between Lucia and another microblogger that demonstrates, perhaps better than the analysis undertaken here can, the significant role that bonds (and bonding icons) play in maintaining Firth’s ‘communion of feeling’:

$@$ Kate Sam and I send you a big virtual hug from Sydney @Lucia Oh no you don’t! No hugging allowed. Send wine instead.

# Notes

1. ‘Ambient’ is used throughout this article to refer to the interpersonal affordances of social media as a communicative channel that allows users to commune with others without

necessarily engaging in direct conversational exchanges (e.g. see discussion of hashtagging practices in later sections as well as in Zappavigna, 2012).   
2. For a useful overview, see Bucholtz (2009).   
3. For an overview of these concepts, see Prior (2003).   
4. This disposition is informed by a persona’s particular semiotic ‘repertoire’ that arises out of the potential semiotic ‘reservoir’ available via their membership in a given community (Bernstein, 2000).   
5. ‘Search’ refers to the ability of a computer system to select a subset of documents from a larger collection based on a set of criteria such as keywords.   
6. This conception of a semiotic ‘bond’ draws upon Knight’s (2010) model of affiliation developed in work on the negotiation of evaluative stance (‘couplings’ of experiential and evaluative meaning) in conversational humour.   
7. I do not intend by using this term to foreground a distinction between online and offline personae, but rather to indicate the affordances of ‘searchable talk’ (Zappavigna, 2012) (e.g. metadata use) that make values shared in microblogging discourse ‘findable’ and hence ‘bondable’.   
8. Page (2012: 196) has noted that ‘the kinds of talk which aggregate around hashtags (even those used by ‘‘ordinary’’ Twitter members) involve multiple participants talking simultaneously about the same topic, rather than individuals necessarily talking with each other in dyadic exchanges that resemble a conversation’.   
9. For analysis of social media memes, see Zappavigna (2012).   
10. Halliday and Matthiessen (2004: 219) define attributive relational processes as relationships where ‘an entity has some class ascribed or attributed to it’.   
11. The Twitter streaming API is the language that software tools use to communicate with Twitter’s back-end database. The API allows developers to collect a subset of tweets from the public Twitter feed.   
12. Names have been changed in this post.   
13. The exact size of HERMES is 100,281,967 words.   
14. Small caps are used to indicate technical terms derived from Appraisal, a model of evaluative language (Martin and White, 2005) which is explained in more detail later in the article.   
15. Appraisal theory considers other dimensions that are beyond the scope of this article. Attitude is inflected by the way a text either excludes or includes other voices via the engagement system through the choice between monoglossia and heteroglossia. In addition, the evaluation may be upscaled or diminished via graduation systems (see Zappavigna, 2012).   
16. System networks are an alternative to modelling language as a catalogue of structures. This kind of systemic orientation to meaning arose out of the Firthian tradition in linguistics which asserted the need for a distinction between structure and system, that is, between syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations in language (Firth, 1957).   
17. I will refer to couplings as ‘collocative values’ to suggest the corpus-based approach adopted in this article.   
18. Collocation and collogation refer to a form of analysis where a node word or grammatical feature is considered in relation to a frame in the co-text of a particular size (e.g. five words before and after the node word).   
19. For exploration of the interrelationship of theories of identity and the concept of face, see Spencer-Oatey (2007).   
20. For analysis of the gendered language of parenting in relation to representation of fatherhood, see Sunderland (2006).   
21. The exchange presented here has been removed from its original context within the different users’ particular twitter streams. The generally asynchronous nature of these kinds of

exchanges should be noted (despite the potential for users to communicate near-synchronously via Twitter).

22. For analysis of the label ‘geek\*’ in HERMES, see Zappavigna (2012).   
23. See Martin and White (2005).   
24. Keywords were automatically determined using concordance software. They represent words that occur with unusual frequency when a corpus is compared with a larger reference corpus.   
25. It might be argued that hashtags make the value negotiated in a post more ‘bondable’ in the sense that they increase the number of potential microbloggers who will view the post.   
26. Urban dictionary defines a humblebrag as ‘Subtly letting others know about how fantastic your life is while undercutting it with a bit of self-effacing humor or “woe is me” gloss’ (Urban Dictionary, 2011).   
27. Within face-to-face modalities it appears that paralinguistic, multimodal cues such as gesture and posture assist with analysing how bonds are orchestrated (Martin et al., 2013). As we have seen in the context of microblogging (where we do not have these types of paralinguistic clues), markers of solidarity such as hashtags are also of assistance.   
28. These include ‘(including relatively ‘‘local’’ familial, collegial, professional and leisure/recreational affiliations and more ‘‘general’’ fellowships reflecting ‘‘master identities’’ including social class, gender, generation, ethnicity, and dis/ability)’ (Martin et al., 2013: 490).   
29. I have largely focused on a single user’s Twitter stream in this article in order to conduct detailed discourse analysis. Larger quantitative studies sampling microbloggers who participate in different kinds of communities will be needed to determine whether pattern of bonds can be generalized.
