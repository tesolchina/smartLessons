# Abstract

Conventional wisdom on abstracts has it - and is strongly supported by the guidelines provided by international abstracting standards [American National Standards for Writing Abstracts (1979) New York: American Standards Institute] as well as guidebooks on academic writing- that the abstract only provides the main points of a study as briefly, concisely and ‘objectively’ as possible. Yet abstracts may include a surprising number of evaluative speech acts. Such evaluations may take place not only implicitly, in metaphoric terms, as e.g. Hunston [Hunston, S. (1993). Evaluation and ideology in scientific writing. In M. Ghadessy (Ed.), Register analysis: theory and practice. London: Pinter, 57–73] has shown in her study of evaluation in research articles, but also more explicitly, as realizations of personal judgements by means of attitudinal lexis and modal constructions. This article reports on a study of evaluation in research article abstracts across disciplines. The results of the study revealed differences in the manifestation, number and type of explicit evaluations in the abstracts belonging to different disciplines in the field of the humanities, social and natural sciences. The abstracts also revealed differences in the rhetorical structure of abstracts, in particular, in the human sciences. Such interdisciplinary differences need to be taken into account when teaching abstract writing to students entering the academic discourse community.

# 1. Introduction

The objectivity of scientific and scholarly writing has been challenged for two decades now by, for example, Bazerman (1984: 163–165), Myers (1989, 1990) and Hunston (1993, 1994). Furthermore, the prevalence of evaluation in all human discourse has been addressed by the Russian linguists Arutjunova (1984, 1988) and

Volosinov (1986). Similarly, the Finnish scholars, Heikkinen et al. (1999), while discussing narrative research, have pointed out how ‘it is possible for research to produce an authentic view of the reality but no objective truth’ [my translation]. Although it is commonly thought that narratives are encountered in the humanities and some discourses pertaining to social sciences, the term ‘narrative science’ is not, however, confined to these disciplines only but such discourses can also be encountered in the natural or hard sciences. Moreover, some disciplines traditionally regarded as humanistic subscribe to the reporting patterns of experimental research, that is, what is conventionally regarded as the hard sciences. This is often the case in, for example, various branches of linguistics. It seems that the dichotomy of soft and hard sciences is rather fluid and as such insignificant, and it might be better to resort to Myers’s glossing of scientific writing as ‘the narrative of science or the narrative of argumentation’ (Myers, 1990: 141–142).

Hunston (1993: 57; following Kress & Hodge 1979, Fairclough 1988 & Martin 1986) points out that ‘the ideology within which a text is written constrains choices in discourse organization, grammar and lexis’. Thus, if we are concerned with particular genres specific to academic or institutional discourse communities, we shall have to obey their rules as regards, for example, evaluation in academic texts. Hunston (1993: 58) defines evaluation ‘as anything which indicates the writer’s attitude to the value of an entity in the text’. These attitudes are usually expressed as personal judgements couched in attitudinal lexis. The value system of the academic/ scientific discourse community is thought to prefer impersonal discourse with no explicit evaluation (see also Mauranen, 2002: 116); hence, according to Hunston (1993: 58), evaluations may be performed in non-personal, that is, metaphoric terms (in Halliday, 1985 terminology) and expressed implicitly with non-human actors. Rather than going into descriptive details and elaborations of the following kind: $^ { \circ } I$ gained these results in my study and on the strength of my data I suggest that. . .’, Hunston offers an example of ‘These results suggest that. . .’, in which ‘these results’ encapsulate all the human effort gone into the research.

Hunston distinguishes three categories through which evaluation is implicitly manifested in the reporting of research. These are status, value and relevance (Hunston, 1993: 60) Status, firstly, reflects the writer’s degree of certainty and commitment towards the proposition and is always present and constantly evaluated in research writing. The evaluation of status takes place through the writer’s different commitment expressed, for instance, in terms of known–unknown, certain–uncertain, probable–unlikely.

The second of Hunston’s categories, value, denotes quality on the good-bad scale. We operate in the value system of ‘good research’, which means that even if the markers of attitudinal lexis (attributes such as good and successful ) are missing, the writers’ attitudes to the value of their research are clear. Research articles often posit hypotheses whose value is then evaluated according to whether the hypotheses are supported or not (Hunston, 1993: 63). The evaluation of value usually takes place through lexis expressing accuracy, consistency, verity, simplicity, usefulness, reliability or importance, which renders the other language items traditionally regarded as evaluative redundant.

The third category is called relevance, which refers to evaluation of the degree of significance or relevance of the argument in a research article. Hunston defines Relevance Markers as metadiscursive clauses with a discourse-organizing function. These clauses thus ‘summarize the preceding or subsequent text and indicate its significance or relevance to the argument of the discourse and to the scientific community’ (Hunston, 1993: 65).

My assumption is that research article abstracts are evaluative per se, since they summarize research articles which are persuasive, and therefore, evaluative, as convincingly shown by Hunston. Hunston argues that implicit evaluation is the typical type of evaluation in research articles. The purpose of this study is, however, to discover whether research article abstracts also contain more explicit evaluation, that is, attitudinal language, in addition to implicit evaluation. By attitudinal language I mean explicit evaluation—in Hunston’s terms: value, and also modality—in Hunston’s terms: status. I regard status as a sub-category of evaluation in the same way as, for example, Thompson and Hunston (2000: 5) do.

# 2. Data and method

My data consisted of 300 abstracts, randomly photocopied from a variety of journals $( N = 5 1 )$ ) on display in the local university library at the end of the year 2000. All the abstracts appeared to be written by the authors of the research articles. The abstracts were divided into the domain of the humanities $N = 1 0 0$ ; including general and applied linguistics, literature, anthropology, cultural studies and history); social sciences $N = 1 0 0$ ; including education, psychology, sociology, human geography, economics and business administration) and natural sciences $N = 1 0 0$ ; including ecology, soil science, botany, animal biology, limnology, oceanography, terramechanics, forestry, physics, chemistry, mathematics and mathematical statistics).

# 2.1. Length of abstracts

The abstracts displayed a great deal of variation in their length, the editorial policy of the journals usually keeping the abstract length within a journal fairly consistent. Table 1 shows the range of the abstract lengths in the three disciplinary domains.

Table 1 Length of abstracts   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Words/ abstract</td><td>Shortest abstract</td><td>abstract</td><td>Words/Longest abstract</td></tr><tr><td>Humanities</td><td>49</td><td>Commonwealth</td><td>360</td><td>Poetics Today</td></tr><tr><td>Social Sciences</td><td>62</td><td>Human Resource Management</td><td>276</td><td>Behavioral Disorders</td></tr><tr><td>Natural Sciences 20</td><td></td><td>Journal of the London Mathematical Society 560</td><td></td><td>Ecology</td></tr></table></body></html>

There is no doubt that the length of the abstracts had an impact on the findings. Since the data are not computerized, it was, unfortunately, impossible to provide any more statistics about the abstract length. A different selection of journals might have produced different results because of variations in the academic conventions of different disciplines and, to a minor degree, of journals within the same discipline.

# 2.2. Rhetorical structure of abstracts

Another source of difference in abstracts was their rhetorical organization. The American National Standards for Writing Abstracts suggests that ‘an abstract should be as informative as is permitted by the type and style of the document; that it should present as much as possible of the quantitative or qualitative information contained in the document’ (ANSI, 1979: 7 ). Martı´ n (2002), following SalagerMeyer (1990), has discussed the question of completeness of the abstract if it does not follow the I–M–R–D (Introduction–Method–Result–Discussion) structure of the underlying research article. Table 2 shows a few common types of rhetorical structure found in abstracts.

Although the majority of the abstracts, that is those that could be attributed to the disciplines in which experimental research is the current mode of investigation, were largely convergent to the ANSI suggestion, literary abstracts usually showed a different rhetorical structure. Literature abstracts sometimes made a generic reference to an essay, which consequently prompted a different rhetorical structure and style in the abstract. In the present study most literary abstracts seemed to be organized in terms of topic, argument and conclusion, as the following abstract demonstrates (Table 3).

The closer the abstract complied with the ANSI norm of the informative abstract, the more implicit evaluation it seemed to include.

# 2.3. Analysis

The analysis of the abstracts was carried out manually and intuitively. The guiding principle was to trace such lexical, syntactic or modal items which tended to add the writer’s own voice to the propositional content. Sometimes it was difficult to decide whether an item projected an expression of attitude or belonged to the contents. Items in point were comparators: higher–lower, or verbs such as reduce, increase, develop, etc. The comparators in an utterance of the following kind were not counted as explicit evaluation: ‘These are seen as better and safer places by whites.’ The reason for their exclusion was the lack of clarity whether it was the author of the abstract or the whites themselves who supplied the attributive evaluation.

Bold henceforth denotes implicit evaluation, italics explicit evaluation. (Book titles have their original italics.)

As regards intuition, Channell (2000: 39) has quite rightly argued that intuition may not be enough in the analysis of evaluation, but the help of electronic corpora is indispensable in deciding the more inherent nature of evaluative items (also, Thompson & Hunston, 2000: 18). Yet it may be argued that decisions about the evaluative force of various lexical items quite often depend on the context, and hence, may not be noticeable in a corpus-based study, which naturally may offer other advantages. For example, the following sentence from a physics abstract might not have been discerned in a corpus-based study since it does not possess any overtly evaluative lexical items in the conventional sense:

(1) Furthermore, we have obtained polarization insensitive operation by handling the two orthogonal components of the signal pulse at two different points. (NatSci)

However, the interplay of the discourse marker furthermore and a contentaccounting attribute polarization insensitive in the cotext of implicitly evaluative (i.e., explaining the research process) discourse items, such as obtain, produces an effect which can be interpreted as overtly evaluative. Similarly, it was possible for the same item of language to assume different evaluative stances in different contexts, which makes quantification in the present type of analysis somewhat tentative.

It was expected that different disciplines would use evaluation in different ways. For example, Burgess and Fagan (2001) in their study of academic conflict in research articles across the disciplines have found that ‘younger’ disciplines, such as tourism, ‘may show greater internal variation in discourse practices than the older more established disciplines’. Similarly, Rongen Breivega et al. (2002) in their contrastive and interdisciplinary pilot study of cultural identity in academic prose have noted that differences between disciplines may outweigh those between languages.

# 3. Findings

# 3.1. Evaluative language

The analysis of the abstracts revealed differences in the quantity of explicit evaluation across the three main disciplinary domains. As regards the manifestations of overall explicit evaluation, the humanities abstracts did not differ from those from the social and natural sciences, which was somewhat contrary to initial expectations. Where differences were encountered, however, was in the distribution of different types of evaluation across the disciplines. Tables 4–8 provide a tentative quantification of attitudinal lexis in the present sample in terms of various syntactic functions, such as attributes, modifiers, adjuncts in the pattern of $\cdot _ { x }$ is $y '$ and evaluative nominal and verbal groups. For the sake of clarity, in the examples provided, only the feature being exemplified at the time is indicated by italics even though the same example may include other types of evaluations as well. The structure showing implicit evaluation is underlined.

Explicitly evaluative attributes formed the most common group of evaluative instances in this study. Although the difference between the humanities and social science abstracts in the number of attributes was not significant (according to the Chi-Square Test of Independency of Proportions, which proved most of the other interdisciplinary relations statistically significant), the trend was clear, showing that evaluative attributes were twice as common in the humanities and social science abstracts as in those from the natural sciences. The following examples indicate the types of attributes in the different disciplinary domains.

(2) The relationship between intellectual secularization and the writing of academic history has long been one of the major neglected themes in British historiography, and its unexamined presuppositions are explored here in relation to the religious history of the eighteenth-century. (Hum)

(3) This paper argues, however, that powerful and persuasive contemporary critiques of notions of objective or value-neutral development and flourishing raise quite serious theoretical problems (expressed here as antinomies) for any analogous view of teaching as a profession. (SocSci)

(4) Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is an important fruit crop worldwide and a model for studying fruit development. (NatSci)

Evaluative attributes were particularly common in the background and introductory statements of abstracts where previous studies were evaluated and gaps in knowledge indicated, as in Example 2. Example 4 displays an evaluative discourse move with a centrality claim (see Swales’ CARS model 1990: 140ff.), which appeared to be common in the bio-sciences. This kind of opening gambit forms a rather formulaic phrase in the abstract, typical of scientific writing but is, nonetheless, an incidence of explicit evaluation.

The evaluative adverbs pre- or postmodifying verbs were employed in the humanities twice as often as in the social and natural sciences. Evaluative premodifiers seemed to be more common than postmodifiers. This kind of evaluation was particularly common in conjunction of reporting verbs, as in Example 7 below.

(5) This non-alignment is only tractable in the classroom teaching of languages if fully acknowledged as artificial, even when the methods used appear ‘naturalistic’. (Hum)

(6) This recognition deeply affects the understanding of wisdom inherited from the past, such as the fundamental welfare theorem and some of the basic characterization of a market economy, and provides explanations of economic and social phenomena that otherwise would be hard to understand. (SocSci)

(7) The overwhelming domination of the government with negligible participation by citizens contrasts vividly with urban forestry in other countries and deprives the programme of the necessary popular support. (NatSci)

The $ { \mathbf { \hat { \rho } } } _ { \mathbf { X } }$ is $y '$ structure was most commonly employed to argue that a finding is positive, interesting or important. This type of evaluative structure seemed to be somewhat more common in the social science abstracts than in those from the humanities, the natural science abstracts making the least use of it.

(8) Indeed, it is arguable that as a result Disraeli’s political strategy in later life was in some ways both quixotic and outdated. (Hum)   
(9) Services for welfare mothers who wish to go on to college are severely inadequate. (SocSci)   
(10) The combination of plasma or chemical etching with FIB micromachining appears to be promising for the fabrication of a large variety of multiple-period 3D photonic crystals at optical wavelengths. (NatSci)

Evaluative nouns also appeared to be most prevalent in the social science abstracts, which is not surprising since such a great deal of research in this disciplinary domain deals with problems of various kinds. Nevertheless, lexical items such as importance, relevance, gain and (positive/negative) effect were also common in all three disciplinary areas.

(11) The tales of divine judgements on sinners which are found throughout John Foxe’s famous martyrology, the Acts and monuments, and also collected in a concluding appendix to the work, have often been dismissed as the products of gossip, while Foxe’s printing of them has been traditionally regarded as an idiosyncratic, but ultimately insignificant aberration in his historical writing. (Hum)

(12) ESAPs’ devastation of the poor translates into recurrences of socioeconomic crises that threaten peace and social justice and compounded [sic] by natural calamities and the relentlessness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. (SocSci)

(13) We review current knowledge and highlight the deficiencies and potentials for new research, in relation to specific areas identified as of key importance in forest dynamics. (NatSci)

Evaluative verbs are also used most often by social scientists. The following examples all indicate problems in previous research. In the social science abstract (Ex. 15) the verb conflate, which is fairly neutral in its general sense, gains its negative evaluative force from the context, which explains how different these three types of memory structures, in fact, are.

(14) Many of these techniques violate Poplack’s (1980) second constraint, namely, the ‘No Equivalence Constraint’. (Hum)

(15) I argue that Ericsson and Kintsch’s concept of retrieval structure conflates three different types of memory structures that possess quite different properties. (SocSci)

(16) While in most lowland lakes, DOC can be used to predict UV transparency with sufficient accuracy, current models fail to estimate UVR in clear alpine lakes. (NatSci)

Although the numbers of evaluative lexical items were fairly similar, the qualitative analysis of abstracts showed that evaluation in the humanities and in some social science abstracts takes more explicitly attitudinal forms. The natural science abstractors seemed to work with comparators and their intensifiers, while their humanistic counterparts brought into play such words as quixotic and obstinately nebulous, found in the history abstracts. Common positions for evaluation were different discourse moves, for example, those indicating a gap in knowledge, counterclaims, findings in relation to previous research and claims of new knowledge. A gap in knowledge was usually indicated by such evaluative lexical items as little, few, not much, the verb fail or negation in general. Claims of new knowledge were put forward by such evaluative attributes as new, novel, innovative, alternative and with some less obvious items, such as ‘our methodology’ or ‘our understanding’, which gained their evaluative contents through the juxtaposition of the ‘older/present’ and the ‘newer/our’ methods or interpretations in the context of the abstract. The word new was particularly common in the humanities abstracts. These also made frequent use of the prefix ‘re-’ in the evaluative sense of re-examining, reinterpreting, reconstructing, recasting the problem or by offering a fresh perspective.

# 3.2. Modality

Hunston classifies modal expressions as instances of implicit evaluation, placing them in the category of status, which reflects the writer’s commitment to the proposition. Although modal parts of speech may not be in the same category of explicit evaluation as the more clearly evaluative lexical items, they seem to assume a similar communicative function in the discourse of abstracts. Thus, modality represents an interface between implicit (i.e., intended) and explicit (i.e., visible) evaluation.

Table 9 differentiates between instances of epistemic modality according to the functional parts of the abstract, showing how the background is the place where epistemic modality frequently occurs in both the humanities and the natural sciences, whereas most modal expressions in the social sciences abstracts are located in their result and conclusion sections. As the examples below show, may is the most common lexical item employed, and modal verbs abound in comparison with other modal expressions.

# 3.2.1. Background

(17) Later research has indicated that, for example, some children learning Japanese may produce word forms that contain three to five syllables already at the age of 15 months among the first 50 words. (Hum)

(18) First, social norms and psychological dispositions extending beyond the selfish motives of Homo economicus [original italics] may have and important bearing on outcomes, even in competitive markets. (SocSci)

(19) Interannual variability, although often less severe than shorter-scale variability, may also be important in structuring intertidal systems. (NatSci)

# 3.2.2. Purpose

(20) Following an initial investigation (Izumi, Begelow, Fujiwara, & Fearnow, 1999), this study examines the noticing function of output (Swain, 1995, 1998), namely, the activity of producing the target language that may prompt L2

learners to recognize their linguistic problems and bring relevant aspects of the L2 to their attention. (Hum)

# 3.2.3. Method

(21) By examining the diverse ways narrative is inflected in different institutional settings, we might also discover something about our concern for narrative now and our notions of disciplinarity and the compartmentalization of knowledge. (Hum)

(22) The paper shows that international migration may improve the position of both policymakers and unions in small open economies irrespective of whether they cooperate or not. (SocSci)

(23) The hypothesis tested was that mycorrhizae would increase C assimilation by increasing photosynthetic rates and reduce below-ground biomass allocation by improving nutrient uptake. (NatSci)

# 3.2.4. Results

(24) In particular, I argue that far from being relegated to the realm of discursive and, by extension, sociopolitical monologicity, poetry may plausibly be construed as the [original emphasis] dialogically and sociopolitically exemplary mode of discourse in Bakhtin’s writings. (Hum)

(25) We find that an increasing supply of skill of globalization may increase the rate of creative destruction, the skill premium, and the skilled wages, and it may depress the unskilled wages. (SocSci)

(26) Ash from gasified alfalfa stems seems to be a potential source of $\mathrm { K }$ and a potential liming agent for acid soils. (NatSci)

# 3.2.5. Conclusions

(27) As such, the four strategies may also, it is suggested, underpin other (visual, gestural) semiotic regimes. (Hum)   
(28) The presence of migration does not necessarily lead to a better outcome. (SocSci)   
(29) Extensions to the model may be able to increase its relevance to practical issues of diet selection. (NatSci)

Table 10 shows the distribution of deontic modality between should and need and its derivatives, including must. Although the manifestations of deontic modality are infrequent in abstracts, there seems to be a slight preference for need rather than should.

(30) There are many and more important links, but these are more complex than is often recognized, and consequently they necessitate more subtle economic theory focusing on what links Europe and Asia rather than on dichotomies. (Hum)

(31) Further research is needed to understand the etiology and neuropathological basis of sequelae, the long-term developmental implications of LSW, and treatment needs. (SocSci)

(32) Thus it is not possible to define appropriate grazing management techniques for specific aims, yet there is an urgent need for this type of knowledge, especially in countries with little remaining natural forest. (NatSci)

Finally, Table 11 shows how rare it is indeed for abstracts not to display any markers of explicit evaluation or modality.

# 3.3. Other expressions of evaluation

The evaluative items presented in the above tables and discussions only scratch the surface of evaluation. The abstracts offer a great number of other facets through which explicit evaluation could be traced and investigated. Perhaps the most important of these are discourse markers, which certainly deserve a study of their own. For example, utterances expressed by means of not only. . .but also are invariably evaluative. Another important area of evaluation is the great variety of negative expressions used to indicate a gap in knowledge, the discourse functional move which often makes its way into the abstract. Similarly, conventional research formulae, such as good agreement or good results, which may have lost their imminent evaluative force while becoming fossilized in academic discourse, would provide interesting avenues to explore. Other evaluative terms pertaining to statistical significance were excluded from the present study and relegated to the description of contents.

Table 10 Deontic modality (obligation) in abstracts   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Should</td><td></td><td>Need/necessary/must etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Humanities</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Social Sciences</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Natural Sciences</td><td>3</td><td>10</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 11 Number of abstracts with no attitudinal lexis or modality   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>No attitudinal lexis or modality</td><td>Number of abstracts</td></tr><tr><td>Humanities</td><td>1</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Social Sciences</td><td>3</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Natural Sciences</td><td>18</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

Finally, the importance of context for the present type of analysis must not be overlooked as the meaning of the same lexical item may have a different signification in the narrative and hard sciences. The word significant is a case in point, as the following two examples show:

(33) Despite dominant patriarchal impulses within Igbo society, a closer attention to narrative strategy in Arrow of God demonstrates that women also contribute in significant ways to the Igbo nationalist tradition and to the mobilisation against colonialist ideology. (Hum)

(34) When age was controlled for, cognitive deterioration was significantly positively associated with caregiver difficulties and service use and negatively associated with life experiences for the individual. (SocSci).

The first literary example uses the word significant in the meaning of ‘important’, while the second, the psychology extract, provides the lexical item with the technical terminological sense of ‘statistically significant’. The latter use of ‘significant’ was not regarded as evaluative in the present analysis.

# 4. Conclusions

On the strength of this study I would argue that persuasion in research article abstracts is not only expressed implicitly, as suggested by Hunston in regard with research articles, but that it is often rendered more explicit by means of what is regarded as conventional evaluative lexis. This study showed that research article abstracts make use of attitudinal language as well as modal constructions of various kinds. The research plan to examine evaluation through interdisciplinary eyes produced some tendencies rather than highly conspicuous differences between the three major domains. It seemed clear that abstracts in the humanities and social sciences as a group used more evaluative attributes than those in the natural sciences, while the latter more often resorted to modality as a way of expressing authorial stance.

A further disparity appeared in the methods of abstracting used in the narrative and hard sciences. In this respect the three disciplinary domains manifested their own internal tendencies according to whether their sub-disciplines reported their findings within the framework of experimental or more narrative research. These tendencies did not follow the conventional paths of the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Consequently, in the humanities the literature and history abstracts, in particular, differed from those of linguistics in the quantity of attitudinal language. In the social sciences, in turn, human geography and education followed a more narrative line than did, for example, psychology, and in the natural sciences it was forestry and life sciences that more often than not turned to narratives, which again meant an increase in overt evaluative devices.

A case in point of these inter- or sub-disciplinary differences in the field of social sciences is economics and business administration, which also confirms Burgess and Fagan’s (2001) point about differences caused by disciplinary age or establishment. The economics abstracts commonly resorted to modality only, while those of business administration made ample use of attitudinal lexis. It is obvious, however, that personal writing styles and the editorial policies of academic journals also had their say in the employment of evaluative discourse.

An important use of research article abstracts is in the on-line retrieval of academic information. In this respect, the suitability of international abstracting standards for narrative sciences, in particular history, has been questioned by Tibbo (1992). In the present study the history abstracts were found to conform to the abstracting guidelines more closely than, for example, the literature abstracts. Another issue is the fact that several literary journals consulted for this research did not provide any abstracts at all. The common labelling of the research article in the field of literary criticism as essay also reinforces its liminal status among the other narratives of science.

The implication of the present study for the teaching of abstract writing is that students should be taught according to the conventions of abstract writing in their own fields. Accordingly, it is not useful to teach students of literary criticism or history the rhetorical structure suggested by the ANSI abstracting guidelines. Instead, they should be analyzing abstracts in journals of their own disciplines. The teaching of abstract writing is best done at a stage when students have concrete data to draw material from for the abstract. Ideally, the students are the authors and collectors of their own data. But as in the real world, not all abstracts are written by authors of the research articles but by abstractors compiling indexing abstracts (Ra¨ isa¨ nen, 2000). Similarly, in the early stages of studying the learning and practising of abstracting can naturally be done on the basis of other scholars’ research or in relation to articles from which the existing abstract has been removed so that the students can be invited to construct another.
