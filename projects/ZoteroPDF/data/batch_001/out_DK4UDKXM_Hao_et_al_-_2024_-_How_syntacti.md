# ABSTRACT

Keywords: L2 Chinese writing Syntactic complexity Fine-grained indices Syntactic-annotated corpus

Previous syntactic complexity (SC) research on L2 Chinese has overlooked a range of Chinesespecific structures and fine-grained indices. This study, utilizing a syntactically annotated Chinese L2 writing corpus, simultaneously employs both large-grained and fine-grained syntactic complexity indices to investigate the relationship between syntactic complexity and writing quality produced by English-speaking Chinese second language (ECsL) learners from macro and micro perspectives. Our findings reveal the following: (a) at a large-grained level of analysis using syntactic complexity indices, the generic syntactic complexity indice (GsC indice) number of Tunits per sentence and the Chinese-specific syntactic complexity indice (CsC indice) number of Clauses per topic chain unit account for $1 4 . 5 \%$ of the total variance in writing scores among ECSL learners; (b) the syntactic diversity model alone accounts for $2 4 . 7 \%$ of the variance in Chinese writing scores among ECSL learners; (c) the stepwise regression analysis model, which integrates fine-grained SC indices extracted from the syntactically annotated corpus, explains $4 3 . 7 \%$ of the variance in Chinese writing quality. This model incorporates CSC indices such as average ratio of dependency types per 30 dependency segments, the ratio of adjuncts to sentence end, the ratio of predicate complements, the ratio of numeral adjuncts, the mean length of Topic-Comment-Unit dependency distance, as well as GSC indices like the ratio of main governors, the ratio of attributers, the ratio of coordinating adjuncts, and the ratio of sentential objects. These findings highlight the valuable insights that syntactically annotated fine-grained SC indices offer regarding the writing characteristics of ECsL learners.

# 1. Introduction

Interlanguage i the linguistic system produced by second language leaners (hereafer L2 leaners) and constitutes an independent progressively developing and dynamic language system that possses linguistc features of both the native language and the target language (Selinker, 1972). Syntax stands as one of the fundamental pillrs of human language systems, with syntactic competence playing a pivotal role in the second language acquisition process The search for indices capable of asessing the development of syntactic competence among interlanguage has emerged as one of the paramount concerns in the realm of second language acquisition. Syntactic complexity (hereafter SC) encompases oth the sophistication of syntacticlaboration and the diversity or range of syntactic forms generated by a speaker or writer (Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003).Syntactic complexity serves not only as a vital to0 for assesing linguistic proficiency, but also as a critical component in examining language performance and language development (Kuiken et al., 2019; Lei e l., 2023; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Sanchez & Sunesson, 2023). The assumption regarding complexity in L2 learner writings suggests that texts with a higher level of syntactic complexity exhibit more fundamental and intricate syntactic structures. Conversely, texts with lower yntactic complexity feature only a limited number of basic syntactic structures (Zhang & Ouyang, 2023). To a certain extent, the advancement in syntactic complexity signifies that language leaners are able to produce a wide range of syntactic pattens and provide detailed elaborations on language elements. Durrant :1) et al. (2021) conceptualize writing development as occurring along two primary axes: time and quality. In the current study, we regard the development of writing as an enhancement in quality, rather than as a temporal progressin. According to Durrant :10) et al. (2021), \*there i a strong tendency for L1 studies to focus on development over time and L2 studies to prefer development in terms of quality". Additionall, while the archetypal study of quality evaluates the quality of secific texts (e.g., based on ratins assgned to those texts), a significant minority of 2 studes operationalize qualit in terms of the writers who produced the texts ., based on scores obtained in separate proficiency test. We employ a focus on the development of writing in terms of quality dimensions. To summarize, in this paper, all references to development' concep. tually pertain to the notion of writing development as an enhancement of quality. Our analysis focuses primarily on diverse scoring intervals, which re believed to reflect varying L2 writing competencies. Changes in these scoring intervals ae indicative of alterations in the quality of writing.

According to Crossey and McNamara (2014), the method for assessing writing development involves scrutinizing how linguistic features in a text can forecast human ratings of essay quality. This approach is grounded on the assumption that the syntactic char. acteristics of texts function as pivotal indices of syntactic development. This is based on the belief that the inclusion of more so phisticated syntactic elements within an essay corrlates with higher assessments of its quality. Over time, rearchers have iligently endeavored to quantify syntactic complexity. Length per linguistic unit, density, and ratio represent the primary quantitative methods employed for gauging produced syntacticstructures. These methods involve measuring the length of lingustic units, such as sentences, clauses, and T-units, while also asessing the density of specific syntactic structures. These structures encompas various types of subordinate structures, parall structures, and different phrase types, such as complex noun phrases, prepositional phrases, and adjectival phrases (Durrant et al, 2021). Approximately hundreds of syntactic complexity indices have been employed to characterize L2 English syntactic complexit. These encompass oth large-gained indices that asessoverall yntactic complexit and fine-grained indices that target specific linguistic structures (Durrant et al., 2021).

Syntactic complexity is a multi-dimensional construct (Norrs & Ortega, 2009). The evaluative methodologies employed for assessing syntactic complexity in L2 writing studies are continuously advancing, incorporating a spectrum of linguistic units into the measurement processto elucidate the comprehensive panorama of SC development (Jiang et al., 2019). Large-grained indices and fine-grained serve diffrent purposes, and considering both provides a comprehensive understanding of syntactic complexity. Both large-grained and fine-grained indices hold different academic values. The significance of large-grained syntactic complexity indices lie i their practical appeal, which is further accentuated by their capacity to abstract over the nuanced inricacies of specific learner backgrounds and communicative contexts. This potential for abstraction implies a promise of universal application (Durrant et al. 2022). However, fine-grained indices empower rearchersto identify the specific yntactic constructions that appear to evolve at each developmental level. They provide researchers with more detailed information about specific linguistic tructures, ffering heightened transparency and facilitating a more precise interpretation of variations in the quality of essays by L2 learners. Additionall, a bur. geoning area of research explores the comparison between large-grained and fine-grained complexity measures, investigating their respective ailities to predict the quality of L2 writig (Jiang et al. 2019; Kyle & Crossley, 2017; Li & Yang, 2023; Zhang & Lu, 2022). There is a prevailing trend in current research suggesting that, in comparison to large-grained syntactic complexity indices, fine-grained ones demonstrate a superior capacity for predicting L2 writing quality. For instance, the findings from Zhang and Lu (2022) ilustrate that fine-grained syntactic complexty indices elucidated a more substantial proportion of variance in both L2 English letter and essay quality compared to their large-grained counterparts. In the field of L2 syntactic complexity research in Chinese, further investigation and comparison of the predictive roles of large-grained and fine-grained syntactic complexity indices on L2 writing quality should be advanced.

Nevertheless the landscape of syntactic complexity research reveals three prominent gaps that need addressing. irst, much of the research on syntactic complexity has focused on learners of English (DeVore & Kyle, 2023), the majority of wellestablished syntactic complexity indices have been developed for English as a second language. The absence of comprehensively processed and syntactically annotated corpora limits our abilit to investigate the relationship between syntactic complexity and writing quality among learners engaged in studying Chinese as a second language. Many of the existing indices are incapable of precisely indicating the syntactic relationships betwen the governing elements and the dominated elements within interlanguage. We should focus our endeavors on delving into the annotation and extraction of more fine-grained syntactic complexity indicators, which are derived under the guidance of a comprehensive and systematic syntactic theory. To ccomplish this, we can quantify various Chinese syntactic tructures, building upon the currently limited array of experimental Chinese fine-grained syntactic indices. Second, there is a paucity of research examining the variation of L2 syntactic diversity. In previous research, syntactic complexity has been primarily operationalized through measures that focus on syntactic elaboration, such as the length of the production unit e.. T-unit, AS-unit) and the density of coordination, subordination, and phrasal elaboration. This approach includes assessing the ratio of selected embedded syntactic structures, like subclauses, which are considered to be developmentall or cognitively complex (Kuiken et al., 2019). Nontheless, t is widely acknowledged that syntacic complexity can be exhibited and attained through two distinct approaches: syntactic elaboration and syntactic diversity (Bi & Jiang, 2019).The important role of syntactic diversity in measuring the syntactic complexity of L2 writing cannot be overlooked (Bulte & Housen, 2018; De Clercq & Housen, 2017). Third, the role of linguistic typological features in portraying syntactic complexity, as discussed by De Clercq and Housen (2017) and Yu (2021), has not been sufficiently explored. This oversight i particularly evident when considering the significant syntactic differences between languages like Chinese and English. While both languages have an sVO structure and bi-directional dependency, as noted by Liu (2010), Chinese displays unique typological features like topic precedence, covert connectives, and flexible sentence boundaries. This contrasts with the way English employs inflectioal changes for tense formation. Fr example, in Chinee, verbs expres tenses through particles such as zhe (), le $( { \mathcal { T } } ) _ { i }$ and guo' () a method distinct from the approach in Englishfor expressing tense. The existing research, including works by Jin (2007) and u (2021), primarily focuses on large-grained indices for L2 Chinese writing. The research exploring fine-grained indices to investigate Chinese 2 syntactic complexity fromthe perspective of linguistic typology i only the beginning Hu et al., 2022; Lu & Wu, 2022).

Given the insights and gaps identified in previous research, this study wil, on the one hand, continue to utilize some of the large. grained and language-independent syntactic complexity indices previously employed in English L2 syntactic complexity studies.It will explore which of these indices can efectively assess Chinese L2 writing qualit, thereby examining their typological applicabilit. Meanwhile, by employing a range of syntactically annotated, fine-grained syntactic complexity indices from a multidimensional perspective and considering Chinese typological features, this study wil further investigate the specific indices capable of asessing Chinese L2 writing quality. Therefore, the syntactic complexity indices used in this paper are categorized into two dimensions: large. grained and fine-grained indices. Within these categories, the indices are further divided into Language-Independent SC indices and SC indices with Chinese syntactic typological features. This multidimensional approach assts in pinpointing specific indices that precisely measure the quality of Chinese L2 writing.

# 2. Previous analysis of syntactic complexity in L2 writing

# 2.1. Measuring syntactic complexity of English L2 writing

Syntactic complexity indices were relatively homogeneous and large-grained in earlier research. For example, pioneering scholars have focused on large-grained indices, such as average sentence length, average clause length, T-unit length, and subordinate structure density, at the sentence level (Hunt, 1965; Ortea, 2003; Wolf-Quintero et al., 1998). Theoretically, longer syntactic units produced y language leaners can be indicative of more complex grammatical structures. However, production length may not always accurately reflect the true level f yntactic complexty due to isues such as run-on entencs andthe prece of parall strcture (Jiang t al. 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022). Large-grained syntactic complexity indices "collapse consideration of multiple structural and syntactic features into a single variable (Biber et al, 2020). In a similar vein, these indices "are based solely on the number of elements in a syntactic form and do not take into account the relative frequency of the syntactic forms or the relationship between the syntactic forms and the lexical items with which they are used" (Kyle et al., 2021). Consequently, the interpretation of results obtained from these largely holistic indices may remain ambiguous.

Recently, with the advances in natural language processing facilitating the accurate automatic annotation of linguistic features, fine-grained indices that can reflect linguistic tructure detals have started to atrctattention from scholars, aiming to create a more comprehesive, accurate, and balanced view of sytactic procesing (Biber et l., 2020). ome rearchers have intiated th utilization of fine-grained indices to scrutinize the developmental paterns of various subtypes of lauses and phrases in interlanguage (Biber et a., 2011; Jiang et al., 2021; Kyle, 2016; Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015). This transition seeks to offr a more comprehensive, precise, and well-rounded comprehension of syntactic processing. For instance, Biber et al. (2011) proposed an extensive array of clausal indices and phrasal syntactic complexity indices. Kyle (2016) identified 10 types of phrasal deendents e., adjective modifiers) and seven phrase types (e.g., nominal subjects). Scholars have also explored the use of various types of noun phrases and phraal dependent types in L2 learners (Jiang et al., 2019; Kyle & Crossey, 2018; Paquot, 2018; Zhang et al., 2022). These fine-grained based syntactic complexity studies facilitate our understanding of the diverse grammatical strategies employed by language learners at varying proficiency levels in the construction of complex structures (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Biber e al., 011; Jiang et al., 2019 Norris & rtega, 2009. Several significant studies have also explored the concept that lerners typicall transition from depending on coordination at novice levels to employing subordination, increased nominalization, and greater phrasal embedding at advanced stages of their learning journey (Norris & Ortega, 2009; Ortega, 2012). For example, the development of syntactic complexity in L2 English demonstrates atrajectory wherein there is a transition from an increased use of complex dependent clauses to a heightened use of complex phrasal structures as L2 learners' proficiency levels improve It has been emphasized by ac. ademics that diffring structural levels of syntactic complexity should be treated with language specifi calibration" (Yu, 2021). To recap, L2 syntactic research should cover as many indices of multidimensionality as possible and should probe the complexity of L2 syntax throughout various syntactic levels.

# 2.2. Measuring syntactic complexity of Chinese L2 writing

Comparatively speaking, researches on L2 Chinese syntactic complexity has only recently gained attention. In earlier research, Chinese second language acquisition researchers transfer T-unit-based indices to the L2 Chinese syntactic complexity study It is debatable whether the T-unit based on clause subordination can be useful for studying the syntactic complexity of Chinese as a second language. ome academics have questioned the effctivenes of T-unit as a fundamental analytical syntactc ut to measure 2 Chinese syntactic complexity (Jin, 2007; Yuan, 2009; Yu, 2021). According to Jin (2007), the T-unit indice was proven invalid for Chinese syntactic complexity analysis. Jin (2007) agued that syntactic complexity indices that fit lingustic typological features would have a higher predictive value. Based on the topic-prominent typological characteristics in Chinese (Li & Thompson, 1976). Jin (2007) applied atopic chain in L2 Chinese complexity analysis and introduced the concept of the Terminal Topic-Comment Unit (TrcU) as wellas empty categories within rcus for the analysis of Chinese syntactic complexity. Additionall, Jin (2007) measure the average length of topic chains, the number of clauses in topic chains, and the number f empty categories in each topic chain in the L2 Chinese writings. Yu (2021) propose the TC unit t rcognize the topic chain as the underlying unit of Chinese complexity. This study finds that the mean length of terminable TC-unit and single TC-units per terminable TC-unit in combination prove the most effctive for written Chinese syntactic complexity. Empty categories in TTCUs are reportedly added as a predictor of the holistic score in the stepwise regression model by Lu and Wu (2022). The resulting model explained $2 9 . 4 \%$ of the variance in holistic scores. Hu et al. (2022) demonstrated that three TC-unit-based indices (number of TTCUs, number f clauses per TTCU, and number of ZAs per TTCU) were not only signiicnl otively clat wh rating fhine wriing quality ut offctively diffetiatd l th roficiency levels.

The research on L2 Chinese syntactic complexity indices i becoming increasingly fine-grained as the asessment methods for large. grained L2 Chinese syntactic indices. For instance, Lu and Wu (2022) emphasize the significance of fine-grained L2 Chinese syntactic complexit indice, with a specific focus on the importance of noun phrase complexity in asessing writing quality. They argue that this aspect of syntactic complexity surpasses the explanatory power f topic-comment unit indices. Hu et a. (2022) consider eight types of word combinations (including adjective-noun, adverb-predicate, verb-object, subject-predicate, classfier-noun, preposition-- postposition, preposition-verb, and predicate-complement) into Chinese L2 syntactic complexity study, revealing the importance of predicate-related combinations in asessing L2 Chinese phraseological diversity and complexity. However, the fine-grained syntactic complexity indices employed by Hu et al. (2022) stil rquire further refinement and comprehensiveness. Their study primarily concentrates on topic-comment unit-based and noun phrase complexity measures, and it lacks a more extensive exploration of Chinese-specific syntactic structures. Additionall, in Hu et al. (2022), syntactic relations were entirely automated without manual proofreading, and they did not conduct aregression analysis to examine the relationship between syntactic complexity indices and Chinese writing scores. This limitation hinders our ability to fully comprehend the influence of Chinese-specific syntactic structure indices on predicting writing scores. The LTP syntactic annotation system utilized by Hu et al. (2022) does not encompass a comprehensive and exhaustive set of Chinese syntacticrelations. Based on our empirical examination of the LTP tagging system, we have observed that it comprises only 14 syntactic relations. I some cases, certain Chinesesyntactic relations in the LTP tagging system actually encompassa variety of subtypes within them. For instance, the label "RAD" for dependency syntactic relation encompases various syntactic structural relationships, including at least possessve structures with "" de), adverbial structures with #" de), Chinese tense structures, and predicate complements structures. Therefore, relying olely on full automatic annotation of L2 learner corpora without any manual intervention may raise certain concerns. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the fine-grained syntactic tagging system proposed by Liu and Huang (2006) based on dependency grammar theory, which comprehensively covers all yntacti structures in Chinese. This unified syntacti annotation system consists of 32 dependencies, encompassing complements and adjuncts (excluding punctuation markers. By employing a corpus annotated within this unified dependency syntacticall-annotated corpus, various syntactic indice can be extracted to bridge the previous research gap, which lacked systematic and comprehensive measures of syntactic complexity in Chinese.

# 2.3. Measuring syntactic diversity of L2 writing

The measurement of syntactic diversity assesses the extent to which different syntacticstructures or grammatical features are present in a text or linguistic production, indicating the degree of variation and richness in various syntactic forms such as phrases, clauses, sentences, and other syntactic elements (Bi & Jiang, 2020). Compared to syntactic complexity, there is currently a limited number of measurement indices for syntactic diversity. Park (2017) employed the number of verb-argument construction types (VAC types) and the corrected type-token ratio of VAC (VAC CrTR) as two diversity measures. Syntactic diversty is measured using the root type-token ratio (RTTR) of each dependency relation in Paquot (2019). De Clercq and Housen (2017) introduced the syntactic diversity indice (SDI) and used it to investigate the language development of L2 learners. Furthermore, some researchers have employed Sentence Similarity (SYNsTUT) as a syntactic diversity indice (McNamara et al., 2014).

However, Bi and Jiang (2020) emphasized that existing syntactic diversity indices should be employed with caution. For instance, SYNSTUT is based on the "syntactic parse ree similarity betwen sentences (McNamara et al., 2014), and it may be afected by a high frequency of grammatical errors, particularly incomplete structures in the language of learners, which can impact its automated analysis. SDI and VAc CrTR, on the other hand, focus solely on the diversity of specific syntactic structures, namely the diversity of clause types and verb-argument constructions. Paquot (2019) did not address an overall syntactic diversity indice in the study. Therefore, Bi and Jiang (2020) introduced a new indice for measuring syntactic diversity based on dependency relations using an. notated corpora,termed MSTTRDR-50 (mean 50-segmental TTR of dependency relations). They found that MSTTRDR-50 could ac. count for $3 2 . 1 \%$ of the variance in writing scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in explaining L2 writing qualit. Syntactic diversity research emphasizes the diversity and flexibility of language, whil syntactic complexity research focuses on the complexity of lan. guage structures. Combining syntactic complexity and syntactic diversity provides a more comprehensive understanding of language. Language serves not only as a structured means of onveying information but also encompasses rich modes of expression and style. By simultaneously investigating both aspects, we can gain a deer insight into the syntactic complexity and richness within the interlanguage systems of L2 learners.

# 2.4. L2 Syntactic complexity studies based on syntactically-annotated Corpus

Interlanguage syntactic errors have minimal impact on dependency analysis (Bi & Jiang, 2020), rendering it advantageous for the more efective and consistent identification and extraction of grammatica structures i L2 writing (Kyle, 2016). The ability of de. pendency annotation to extract continuous syntactic rlations from a corpus has led to increasing attention in L2 studies (Bi & Jiang, 2020). Dependency relation syntax places greater emphasis on the relationships between individual constituents that constitute a sentence, enabling the direct handling of word-to-word relationships in a sentence. I is bettr suited for constructing practical natural language processing systems capable of handing real-world languages, thus making t valuable resource for yntactic research. Using dependency relations as the foundational syntactic unit for SC indices, Jiang et l. (2019) gathered data for eght fine-grained indices within the subordinate clauses and noun modifiers dimension in L2 English writings. Bi and Jiang (2020) introduced the corrected TTR of dependency relations to investigate the extent to which the syntactic diversity indice can predict the writing proficiency of sec. ondary schoo English foreign language learners. Furthermore, several studies have examined clausal and phrasal complexity in En. glish L2 learners uing fine-grained indices at the dependency level (Jiang et al., 2019, 2021; Kyle & Crossey, 2018; Paquot, 2018, 2019). However, few studies have utilized similar methodologies in L2 Chinese syntactic complexity research. Dependency distance (DD), a crucial concept in dependency grammar, i considered an indice of syntactic complexity and language processng dificulty (Hudson, 2010; Liu, 2008). Researchers have observed a tendency to minimize dependency distance as it reflects sentence structure difficulty and cognitive cost (Futell et l., 2015; Temperley & Gildea, 2018; Liu et al., 2017). Previous studies have hown that mean dependency distance (MDD) efectively measures the development of syntactic complexity in English and Chinese L2 learners (Hao et al., 2021a; Li & Yan, 2020; Ouyang & Jiang, 2018; Ouyang et al., 2022). However, to date, there has been no study that has in. tegrated dependency distance with Chinese topic chains.

While significant progress has been made in second language syntactic complexity research, it is imperative to recognize the limitations of previous investigations. irst the existing syntactic complexity indices in English are notably comprehensive. However, it is essentia to investigate the applicability of these current syntactic complexity indices to the analysi of L2 Chinese. Fine-grained syntactic complexit indices have predominantly been aplied to asess L2 writig in English, while research on these indices in Chinese istillin is early stage. Speificall, there is a lack of syntactic complexity indices that accurately cature the typological characteristics of Chinese, with only a limited number currently availabl. Furthermore, only a few fine-grained syntactic complexity indices in Chinese have been proposed, which neglect to compare the native language typological features of the Chinese 2 learners with the Chinese target language. Lu and Wu (2022) inroduced Chinese typological indices without considering acomparison with the native language (Korean) of the Chinese leaners in their study. The specific usage of this indice in Korean appears to have been given little consideration, but only compared it with Indo-European languages. Using Chinese-specific syntactic complexity indices without comparing the native language and the target language of Chinese may present certain challenge. The findings obtained by Lu and Ai (2015) strongly suggest that the L1 backgrounds of writers cannot be left unexamined when studying syntactic complexity in L2 writing (Ortega, 2015). Lu and Ai (2015) showed convincingly that L1-related forces, if unidentified in the designs, may contribute error to observations obtained from syntactic complexity indices. We argue that when developing specific syntactic complexity indices that incorporate typological features of the target language, it is crucial to conduct contrastive-linguistic comparisons to account for the linguistic diffrences between the native language and the target language. This approach is essential to determine the salient indices that are particularly pertinent in gauging the writing development proces of L2 learners. Additionally, a paramount concern pertains to the fact that numerous dstinct syntactic structures in Chinese remain largely unexplored. To addres these research gaps, it is crucial to xtract thee syntactic structures from a corpus annotated using a unified deendency syntactically-annotated framework, such as dependency grammar, which can provide an effective solution to this ssue. Additionally, few existing L2 studies have integrated syntactic diversity indices with syntactic complexity indices, which is necessary for a more comprehensive asessment of the syntactic proficiency of L2 learners. To comprehend the influence of syntactic diversity and syntactic complexity on L2 writing development, i is imperative to explore their roles in L2 acquisition and their interactions. Future research on Chinese L2 acquisition should encompass both syntactic diversty and complexity indices to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the inguistic

development of L2 learners.

# 3. Current research

The present study addreses the research gaps by developing a Chinese interlanguage syntactic annotation corpus using a combination of automatic and manual taging methods. The corpus is grounded in dependency grammar theory (Hudson, 2010; Liu, 2008) and encompases all syntactic structures in Chinese. The unified dependency syntacticall-annotated corpus enables accurate and consistent analysis, providing valuable linguistic information. The present study explores the relationship between syntactic complexity and writing quality among English-speaking Chinese L2 learners (hereafter ECL leaners). To achieve this research goal. we have employed 10 large-grained indices based on sentences, clauses, T-units, and topic chains, as well as thirty-five fine-grained indices, including thirt-two syntactic dependency indice, two dependency distance indice, and one syntactic diversity indice. The ten large-grained syntactic complexity indices represent commonly utilized research indices in existing studies on L2 syntactic complexity in both Chinese or English. These syntactic indices can be automatically extracted by computer programs without the need for syntactic annotation and processng. The remaining thirt-five fine-grained syntactic complexity indices are derived from the dependency syntactically annotated Chinese interlanguage corpus. These fine-grained indices necesstate deep-level processing and annotation of L2 learner corpora at the syntactic level using a dependency syntactic analysis framework, followed by automated frequency or occurrence counting of these fine-grained indices through Python scripts. The indices used in this study can be broady categorized into two main categories: large-grained SC indices and fine-grained SC indices. These categories are further divided into two subcategories of indices: generic syntactic complexity indices (GS indices), which are commonly used acros diffrent languages and are independent of any specific language, and syntactic complexity indices with Chinese-specific features (CsC indices). We frst extract specific fine-grained indice of syntactic complexity based on the Chinese syntactically annotated interlanguage corpus, and then compare these indices to large-grained SC indices such as the number and length of syntactic units to determine which type of syntactic complexity indices performs beter in measuring the writing qualit of ECsL learners. The specific research questions are.

RQ(1). What is the predictive power of the large-grained syntactic complexity indices on the writing qualities of ECSL learners! RQ(2). What is the predictive power of the syntactic diversity indice on the writing qualities of EcsL learners?

RQ(3). What is the predictive power of fine-grained syntactic complexity indices extracted from a syntactically annotated corpus or he writing qualities of ECSL learners?

RQ(4). In the dimensions of both large-grained and fine-grained SC indices, which GSC and CSC indices can explain the writing quality of Chinese L2 learners?

# 4. Research methods

# 4.1. Participants and materials

The writing essays data utilized in this research were extracted from The Chinese Proficiency Test Dynamic Composition Corpus. The Chinese Proficiency Test (also known as the Hany Shuping Kaoshi, hereafter HSK) is a standardized criterion-referenced test developed to measure the proficiency level of non-native speakers of standard Chinese, which is similar to TOEFL for English. The grading of the writing section of the HSK is subject to strict and standardized procedures. Evaluators are individuals who hold advanced degrees, either at the master's or doctoral level, and posses extensive experience i teaching Chinese a asecond language. The evaluation proces commences with the meticulous selection of representative benchmark essays, fllowed by rigorous training of graders according to the scoring criteria. Subsequently, two language assessment experts independently evaluate the essays using a blind grading system. After the initial grading, a relevance check is performed. In the event of inadequate concordance among evaluators, an additional ealuator is engaged to reassesthe essays, ensuring the attainment of an equitable and unbiased score. Researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that the reliabilit cofficient of the HSK, as an authoritative language test, consistently excees 0.950 (Sun, 2007). Based on the available technical reports and research, the assesment records of HSK exhibit a remarkable level of uniformity both among the test items and across ifferent genders (Peng et al., 2021). The HSK scoring rubric employs a holistic rating cale that includes analytic components, specifically content and structure, grammar, as well as Chinese character and lexical knowledge. I should be noted that th esay scores within the HSK scoring system are not entirely continuous. In the metadata the testing organization allocates numeri scores to the writing dataset's 12 levels in 5-point increments, from 40 to 95, resulting in 12 distinct categories (Wang & Hu, 2021).

This study takes into account the potential impact of the essay topic or writing prompts on the syntactic complexity in learner texts (Alexopoulou et al., 2017; Zhang & Lu, 2022). However, a disparity was observed in the istribution of essays acrossdifferent scoring segments. Upon controlling for variables such as theme, topics, and authors native language backgrounds, the limited availability of essays in the lower score ranges, particularly thosescoring 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60, became evident. imilarl, the corpus demonstrated a carcity of esays in the higher scoring brackts, especill at th90 and 95-point level. o ensure unfomity across score catores, essays with scores of 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 were grouped together, demed to represent the lowest quality. In a similar manner, essays scoring 90 and 95 were merged, denoted as the highest quality. Essays scoring 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 were sufficientl numerous, negating the need for merging. Ultimatel, a careful selection was made of 245 HSK essays, with scores spanning from 40 to 95 points. Each scoring bracket contained 35 essays, contrbuting to a total of 38,935 words (punctuation excluded). The scores constitute an arithmetic sequence, with each differing by 5.

This study, informed by the methodologies of Yoon (2018) and Jiang et al. (2019), operationalizes writing proficiency in terms of writing scores and defines the development of writing proficiency as an increase in these scores. Our decision to concentrate on writing scores rather than entire examination scores is based on the understanding that total scores encompass overal performance and not just the performance in writing tasks, as Kisselev et al. (2022),2022b) have noted. To asses witing proficiencie, a one-way analysis of variance (AnovA) was used to examine if the segmented score bands could diffrentiate the writing ability of native English speakers. The results revealed a significant difference in writing scores among the seven score ranges of ECSL learners $( p s < . 0 0 1 )$ indicating the meaningfulnessof the segmented scores. We ensured that the genre and topic f each composition were the same across each score range. Essay topics were familiar to L2 leaners, such as Remember a person who has the greatest influence on me or The joys and frustrations in learning Chinese'. In thessays we selected, it was noted that candidates predominantly described specific events. Typically, narrative themes are centered around stories or events narrated in the past tense, as explicated by Kormos (2011) and Yoon (2021). Narrative writing demands an augmented use of personal pronouns, alongside adverbials that specify place and time, as highlighted by Yoon (2021). The multidimensional metric data for writings produced by ECSL learners, narrtive texts by native Chinese speakers, and argumentative texts by native Chinese speakers were further calculated, encompassing indicators such as first, second, and third peron pronouns, adverbs indicating past time, locative and temporal adverbial, aspectual particles for past tense, content words, function words, and abstract nouns. This data then underwent hierarchical cluster analysis utilizing the Euclidean distances between text vectors. The results indicate that the compositions of ECSL learner closely cluster with the narrative texts of native Chinee speakers. This ustring implies that thee two catgories of texts share similarities in the use f thse multidimensional linguistic features. In other words, based on objective data, the compositions of EcsL learners show a greater inclination towards the style of narrative texts over argumentative texts in Chinese. To mitigate the impact of text length on syntactic complexity indices calculation, we controlled each length of essay to approximately 160 words (excluding punctuation). Table 1 provides word counts and writing scores for the corpora of ECsL learners.

# 4.2. Indices and Research Tools

The current study includes 10 large-grained syntactic complexity indices for two domain (length and amount). Specifically, our large-grained syntactic complexity indices include the mean length of sentence (MLS), the mean length of clauses (MLC), the mean length of T-units (MLTU), the number of T-units per sentence (T/S), and the number of clauses per sentence (C/S), which are more commonly used in English. We alo incorporated topic chains a Chinese-specific fine-grained indice, chosen for it proven suitaility in mandarin Chinese based on previous studies (Hu, 2022; Lu & Wu, 2022). In this article, we use the mean length of topic chains (MLTCU), the mean length of topic chain clauses (MLcrcU), the number of clauses per topic chain unit (C/rcU), the number of topic chain units (NrcU) and the number of empty categories in topic chain units (NTcE). The specific definitions can be found in Jin (2007), Yu (2021) and Lu and Wu (2022). These 10 large-grained syntactic complexity indices canall be extracted without the need for dependency syntactic annotated corpora. A summary of the larg-grained syntactic complexity indices is presented in Table 2. In general,the linguistic features asessed by the selected larg-grained SC indices are shared between both Chinese and English, excet for the specific linguistic feature of the "topic chain", which is unique to Chinese.

The syntactic diversity and fine-grained syntactic complexit (SC) indices utilized in this study are extracted from the dependency syntactically annotated Chinese interlanguage corpus based on dependency grammar theory. The interlanguage corpus used in this study, which fllows a unified deendency syntactically-annotated corpus, encompass al syntactic structures in Chinese, rendering it highly comprehensive for syntactic analysis. A syntacticall-anotated corpus based on dependency grammar for ECSL learners has been constructed in this research. Dependency grammar views the sentence as a complete unit structured by the relationships between constituent linguistic units. These relationships involve a dominant element and a dependent element, forming directed dependencies (Liu, 2010). Dependency types facilitate the extraction of target syntactic information and continuity indices systematically and effectiely. The dendency tre is a graphical rreentation of deendeny relations, as iustrated in Fig. 1. In this figure, Subj, bj Adva, and Pobj above the arc denote subject-predicate, predicate-object, adverbial-predicate, and prepositional relations, respectively. The labels $r , p , n ,$ and $\nu$ represent pronouns, prepositions, nouns, and verbs, respectively, while the numbers 1 to 5 indicate word order.

To convert the information from Fig. 1 into Table 3, Python scripts were employed for computational convenience.

To ensure the purity of the composition corpus, we removed word and punctuation errors using the eror tagging system in the HSK dynamic composition corpus. The resulting corpus was then syntactical annotated, including word segmentation, POS tagging, and syntactic dependency annotation. Both machines and linguisic experts collaborated in the dependent syntactic annotation process The Language Technology Platform (LTP) (Che et al., 2021) was used for first automated part of speech annotation and dependency relation tagging. Then we enhanced and extended the syntactic information through manual annotation of the initially machine-labeled data using the syntactic annotation framework proposed by Liu and Huang (2006). Expanding upon the syntactic annotation system of Liu and Huang (2006), we developed thirty-five Chinese fine-grained indices that capture both syntactic complexity and diversty. Three linguistic experts were engaged in the annotation process, with each expert annotating and cross-referencing the corpus on a minimum of three occasions. In instance of disagreement, they convened discussions to reach a consensus for the ultimate sentence annotation.

To asses the evolution of overall syntactic diversity in Chinese interlanguage, this study fllowed the research approach proposed by Bi and Jiang (2020), which utilizes the corrected TTR of dependency relations. However, we adjusted the Chinese syntactic di versity indice to MSTTRDR-30 to accommodate the more than 30 types of Chinese dependency relationships present in the syntactic annotation system we employed. Therefore, this articl posit that the syntactic diversity indice utilized in this article can be classified as a Chinese-specific syntactic diversity indice. In this study, MSTrRDR-30 is also considered a fine-grained syntactic complexity indice,as i is computed as a syntactic diversity indic following fine-grained syntactic anotation. The syntactic complexity measures used in this study were selected as the mean length of dependency distance (MDD), the mean length of Topic-Comment-Unit de. pendency distance (TCMDD), and the usage ratio of 32 syntactic dependency types in the annotated corpus. Based on the syntactic tagging corpus, we identified thirty-five fine-grained syntactic complexity indices, as presented in Table 4. It is noteworthy that the mean length of Topic-Comment-Unit dependency distance is a distinct feature of Chinese among the linguistic characteristics of MDD related indices. Among the linguistic fers of the dndncy relationship, Ada, Atr, Obj, Subj,  Cr, Cor, Epa, Pobj, Oja, Obj2, and Sentobj have a lot of similarities in Chinese and English. In comparison, Chinese has typological language-specific dependency syntactic relations such as Dec, Ma, Cr, c, Comp, Fc, Ta, Soc, Auxr, Subobj, Oc, Plc, Va, Esa, Ina, Top, Dic, Df, Dec, Beis, and Baobj. In this study, we employed a custom-developed Python script, specificll designed for this purpose, to calculate the syntactic complexity indices of ESCL learners. The accuracy of the Python program was verified by manually checking the results for 20 sample essays, achieving a $1 0 0 \%$ accuracy rate.

# 5. Results

Initially, Python scripts were employed tocompute al syntactic complexity indice data utilized in the ESCL writings,followed by conducting descriptive statistics and statistical analyses within sPss 25.0. These procedures aimed to provide a comprehensive explanation of the extracted indice information. The statistical tests encompassed Pearson correlation analysis, multicolinearity analysis, and linear stewise regression analysis. We conducted separat corrlation and regression analyses in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 to examine the relationships between Large-Grained Syntactic Complexity indices and Fine-Grained Syntactic Complexity indices with writing performance. We developed thee linear regression models: a multipleregression model for large-grained syntactic complexity indices, a simple regression model for the syntactic diversity indice, and a comprehensive multiple regresson model for fine-grained syntactic complexity indices. These models were employed to evaluate the predictive capability of large-grained syntactic complexity indices, the syntactic diversity indice, and fine-grained syntactic complexity indices on the writing qualit of ECsL learners. In this study, we report the predictive results of the multiple regresion model for largegrained yntactic complexity indices in Section 5.1.3, the simple regresson model for syntactic diversity indicators in Section 5.2.1, and the comprehensive multiple regression model for fine-grained syntactic complexity indicators in Section 5.2.4.

Through Pearson's correlation analysis using SPs, among the length-related indice, allexcept MU are significantly correlated with Chinese L2 writing scores $( p s < 0 . 0 5 )$ . Higher writing scores are associated with longer average sentence lengths, decreased average clause lengths, increased numbers of T-units per sentence, and increased numbers of clauses per sentence.

Fig. 2 provides a visual view of the development of large-grained GsC indices. To begin, we focus on generic length SC indices. AS depicted in Fig. 2(a), the improvement in Chinese essay scores among ECSL learners corresponds with a significant rise in the MLS value, from 17.641 to 21.676, signifying ECSL leaners' ability to construct progressvely longer sentences. Figs. 2b) and 2c) show that ECSL learners produce longer clauses and T-unts at the 90-95 score level. Compared to the 40-60 score level, the values of MLC and M show slight but stisically insigificant decrase atthe90-95 score level. Second, we oserve the development of generic amount SC indices. The data presented in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e) exhibit a discernible upward trend characterized by fluctuations in both the T/S and C/S ratios.

# 5.1.2. Large-grained CSC Indice

Based on Table 6, the 245 analyzed essays have an average of 16.084 words per topic chain and 6.1025 words per topic chain clause. In the same dimension, the writings of participants exhibit 2.178 clauses per topic chain unit, 2.062 topic chain units, and 3.522 empty categorie in topic chains. Through the corrlation analysis conducted using SPs, with the excetion of MLCTCU, al other five large-grained CsC indices exhibited a significant correlation with Chinese L2 writing scores $( p s < 0 . 0 5 )$ . Moreover, as L2 Chinese writing scores improved, sCL learners showed an increase in the number of topic chains, their lengths, clauses per topic chain unit, and empty categories.

Fig. 3 demonstrates that as the Chinese writing cores of EcsL learners improve, there i a gradual increase in the average length of their Chinese sentence topic chains and sentence topic chain clauses. For instance, the average length of sentence topic chains rises from approximately 12.760 in the 40-60 score range to 17.814 in the 90-95 score range, whil the average length of sentence topic chain clauses increases from around 5.751 in the 40-60 score range to 6.243 in the 90-95 score range. Notably, a critical juncture at the score of 65 in the development of MLrU is observed, with a discernible disruption in its progression persisting until a score f 75. This suggests that with a score exceeding 65, there is asignificant tendency among ECSL learners to extend the length of their topic chains in their essays, resulting in the formation of more complex and elongated chains. Consequently, ECSL learners are capable of producing longer and more sophisticated topic chains. Furthermore, the overallvariation in the average length of sentence topic chains is greater than that of sentence topic chain clauses. Fig. 3(c), 3(d), and 3(e) demonstrate that C/TCU, NTCU, and NTCE each increase as writing scores improves, indicating that the typological features of ECsL learners gradually approximate the topic-prominent typological characteristics of Chinese.

# 5.1.3. Predictive Power of Large-Grained Syntactic Complexity Indices in Predicting Writing Scores

We conducted a stepwise regression analysis in SPss to investigate the relationship between syntactic complexity indices and Chinese L2 writing scores. The results indicate that both T/S and C/ICU are included in the stepwise linear regression model. Furthermore, the estimated standard deviation error for both sets of regresion models is lower than the standard deviation of the dependent variable, which is the writing scores for ECSL learners (11.795). Both T/S and C/TCU have a tolerance greater than 0.5 and a variance infltion factor (VIF) lessthan 2 ater entering the reresson model. This indicates that there is no multicollinearit in this model. This answers Question (1). As presented in Table 7, T/S and C/TCU explained $1 4 . 5 \%$ of the total variance in the writing scores of ECSL learners. The oserved residuals and the scaled versions of the observed residuals have been utilized extensively to examine the validity of regresion models and their assumptions (Rawlings et al, 198). The standardized residual histogram and P-P plot of the large-grained syntactic complexity model follow a normal distribution, and the coefficient of regression model i significant $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ confirming its successful establishment. The $R ^ { 2 }$ of the fine-grained regression model for ECsL learners obtained a medium effect size in accordance with Cohen (1988) reference system of effect sizes.

Although large-grained indices can reflect some degree of syntactic development of ECsL learners, we cannot probe the internal syntactic structure changing of their language production. In the following, we will adopt ine-grained indice from the syntactically annotated corpus as the evaluation indice to reveal a microscopic picture of the syntactic change of ECsL learners.

# 5.2. Fine-Grained Indice

We utilized thirt-five fine-grained syntactic complexity indices, covering syntactic variet, syntactic dependency distance (MDD and TCMDD), and 32 dependency relationship ratio, to examine the developmental patterns in the Chinese 2 writing abilitie of ECSL learners.

# 5.2.1. Fine-Grained Syntactic Diversity Indice

In the assessment of the writing quality of Chinese L2 leaners,syntactic diversity holds an equall crucial position. Therefore, we have chosen to initiall isolate the syntactic diversity indice, MsrRDR-30, for analys and investigate its efectiveness in predicting Chinese second language writing qualities in response to Question (2). We multiplied the value of MSTTRDR-30 by the denominator to convert frequency values into frequency counts for analysis. On average, the 245 essays written by Chinese learners have 12.672 syntactic relationships within 30 dependency relationship groups. As shown in Fig. 4, there is a significant corrlation betwen MSTTRDR-30 and Chinese writing qualities $( p < . 0 0 1$ $r = . 4 9 7 $ . The MSTTRDR-30 indice has shown an increase from 0.402 to 0.446, suggesting that ECSL learners exhibit the capacity to employ 12.06, 12.18, 12.36, 12.45, 12.72, 13.56, and 13.38 types of syntactic relations across a range of writing scores from 40 to 95, respectively.

The regression results are shown in Table 9. The statistics demonstrate that the syntactic diversity indice MSTrRDR-30 alone accounts for $2 4 . 7 \%$ of the variance in writing performance, and is even higher than the overall explanatory validity of the large-grained syntactic complexity model, with a significant regression coefficient $\left( p < . 0 5 \right)$ . This answers Question 2. Presented results indicate that MSTTRDR can also be used as an effctive indice of the syntactic diversty in Chinese L2 learners. This further suggests that the corrected TR of dependency relations have good predictive power not onl for L2 English writing qualities but alsofor the L2 Chinese qualities. According to Verspoor et al. (2017), syntactic structures in interlanguage change as L2 learners become more adept in the second language. This study illustrates that as L2 Chinese writing scores improve, ECSL learners tend to utilize a broader range of Chinese syntactic structures in their writings.

# 5.2.2. Fine-grained syntactic dependency distance

ECSL learners have an average dependency distance of 2.644 and an average dependency distance of 2.242 for producing topi chains. Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) demonstrate an increasing trend in both MDD and TCMDD of ECSL learners.

As the Chinese writing scores of ECsL learners icreasing, the number of yntactic components between words with a dependency relation also increases. This expansion of syntactic hierarchies and higher syntactic complexity suggests that ECSL learners are more likely to produce sentences with sophisticated syntactic structure in their essays. The rise in dependency distance suggests that ECSL learners are enhancing their proficiency in employing diverse embedded syntactic structures within their sentences, indicating an improvement in their ability to incorporate a broader array of such structures. This aligns with similar findings in the research conducted by Ouyang and Jiang (2018) and Li and Yan (2020) on English as asecond language acquisition. This sugests that MDD, as an effective indice for assessing interlanguage syntactic development, holds a degree of general applicabilit. The positive correlation between MSTrRDR-30 values and writing scores, as depicted in Fig. 4, provides further support for this observation. These findings indicate that ECSL learners are progressively acquiring the ability to construct a broader range of diverse and complex syntactic re lationships. In the next section, we will explore specific dependency relationship ratios and provide examples to demonstrate the variation in writing quality among ECsL learners, llustrating how different dependency arrangements contribute to this analytical process.

# 5.2.3. Fine-Grained Dependency Relationship Ratio

Considering the constraints of journal publication space, this section will primarily concentrate on representative and notably diverse fine-grained syntactic relationship indices. We will commence with an examination of the fine-grained GSC dependency relationship indices.

Fig. 6(a) reveals a declining trend in the use of Subj_ RATIO in the writings of ECSL learners. This decline implies that ECSL learners are becoming proficient in constructing sentences without requiring explicit subjects. This phenomenon aligns with the topic. prominent linguisic typological feature of Chinese, which permits subject omission or implication. In contrast, English is a subject prominent language where the subject holds a prominent role (Li & Thompson, 1976). Generall speaking, in English, except for imperative sentences and informal registers, a sentence must have a subject, and there exist non-personal, functional subjects such as $" \boldsymbol { I } t " $ or expletive There' that have weaker semantic meaning but serve as subject in English syntax. ECSL learners have the highest usage rate of Subj within the 40-60 point range. This observation indicates that ECSL learners exhibit a significant transference of the subject-prominence feature from their native language (English) into their lower-quality Chinese writings, consequently resulting in a higher frequency of explicit subject. This phenomenon aligns with the findings presented in the rearch conducted by Jin (1994) and Yuan (1995). With the enhancement of writing qualities among ECsL learners, they increasingly utilize nll subjects in their Chinese writings, articularly when compared to their earlier writings of lower quality. It s suggested by this observation that leaners of ECSL

Figs. 6(b), 6(c), and 6(d) illstrate that the S RATIO of ECSL leaners decreased as their Chinese writing cores improved, while the Cr RATIO and Cr RATIO increased with higher scores.In the syntactic annotation ystem used in this study, S represents the main core predicate of a sentence, $C r$ indicates the connection between clauses in a complex sentence, and Csr represents the coordinating conjunctions that connect clauses within the corresponding complex sentence, such as in Example (1). In Example (1), "oye "(stay up late) dominates "Yinwei" (because), and the deendency relation is aconjunct relation (csr); shui lanjiao" (slep in) dominates" suoy? (so), and the dependency relation is also a conjunct relation, the dependency relation between shui lanio" and "aoye " is a complex sentence relation $( C r )$ . The observed changes in these syntactic relations suggest that the sentence structures of ECsL learners become more complex, characterized by an increase in clauses and phrases, and a decrease in the number of main clauses. This indicates a potentially richer semantic content in their sentences. Additionally, statistical analys shows that the average usage rate of coordnating conjunctions $( 3 . 3 1 \% )$ by ECsL learners is significantly higher than that of Chinese native speakers $( 1 . 3 5 \% )$ , while the average usage rate of complex sentences $( 5 . 5 2 \% )$ is lower than that of Chinese native speakers $( 6 . 6 9 \% )$ . Although the conjunction "Yinwei... suoy.. (bease..) in Examle (1) s fixed cllocation n Chinese complex sentences, Chinese ntie spakers tend to omit one or both of he conjunctions in the real language communication or writing. English is hypotactic language with overt cohesion, where clauses are frequently arranged using connectives. In contrst, Chinese mphasizes parataxis and allows words, phraes, and clauses to be arranged sequentiall without onectives, as long as the sentences maintain logical coherence (Nida, 1982). Therefore, this partly explains why ECSL learners tend to use more conjunctions. Jin (2007) also found that Chinese L2 learners with an English L1 back. ground tend to use various conjunctions toconnect clauses. Even at an advanced level, they believe that using explicit conjunctions can demonstrate the maturity of the Chinese language structure.

Example 1.

a) Yinwei wo zuotian aoye le, suoyi wo jintian zaoshang shui lanjiao le.

Because I yesterday stayed up late (particle indicating completed action), so I today morning slept in.

"Because I stayed up late last night, I slept in this morning.'

Regarding fine-grained CSC dependency relationship indices, Fig. 6(e) shows a decrease in the usage rate of the "De" of) structure as a modifier as ECSL learners' Chinese writing scores improve. ECSL learners more frequently use the De" structure as a complement $( 6 . 6 5 \% )$ . Zhu (1982), a renowned Chinese grammarian, itroduced the concepts of"adhesive structure" and "composite tructure." For instance, in the aributive object structure, 'mitou fangzi (wooden house) reresents the adhesive structure, while "mitou de fangz" (house made of wood) represents the composite structure. In our selected Chinese dependency annotation system, the "De" structure complement represents the composite structure in the attributive object structure. From a linguistic modality perspective, there are notable distinctions between modern Chinese adhesive and composite structures. Adhesive structures are generally considered more formal than composit structures with the "De" tructure, especialy in atributive object structure. However, i actual anguage usage, adhesive structures are predominantly employed in formal written modality, while composite structures with the "De structure are more prevalent in informal spoken modalit. Biber (1988) also believed that atributive adjectives can better package, integrate, and summarize information. Therefore, our results suggest that Es leaners exhibit an oral tendency in their wrtten language, reflecting lower syntactic complexity and integration. Additionall, according to Figs. 6(f) and 6(g), ECsL leaners across L2 writing proficiency levels can gradually move from focusing and concentrating on typical Chinese syntactic structures to atypical unique syntactic structures. In regards to the Chinese language-specific sC indices, $o c$ represents ordinal grammatical expressions formed by grammatical device, i.., those formed by ading typical hinee specialized morpheme marker (eg, di(), l() and chu ( to form Chinese ordinal expressions. As shown in Fig. 6(f), the Oc usage shows a downward trend, indicating a decrease in the ratio of ECSL learners using typically specialized marked ordinal yntactic expressions. The reduction in the use of typical syntactic structures re flects that EsL learners gradually begin to incorporate non-typical ypes in the corresponding syntacticategories. To some extent, this reflects an increase in the syntactic diversity and complexity of the writing of ECL learners. Subobject and Subject Complement together represent the pivotal construction, which is the special syntactic form in modern Chinese. In Fig. 6(g), as Chinese writing syntactic complexity improves, ECSL learners demonstrate an increased usage of pivotal constructions in their Chinese writing.

5.2.4. Predictive Power of Fine-Grained Syntactic Complexity Indices in Predicting Writing Scores

In order to address Question (3), we incorporated thirty-five syntactic complexity indices (comprising one diversity indice, two dependency distance indices, and thirty-two dependency relationship ratio indices) into the comprehensive model based on the syntactically aotated corpus. Inthe final stewise regression model, nine syntactic complexity predictors are retained. As deicted in Table 10, this model includes nine significant predictors that account for $4 3 . 7 \%$ of the variance in holistic scores, making it the most effective predictor of writing cores in this study. The estimated standard eror for the combined SC indices regresion modelis smaller than the standard deviation of the writing performance of ECSL learners (11.795). Additionall, the tolerance of the nine indices remains well above 0.5 afer their inclusion in the regression model, and the VIF is les than 2. Consequently, there i no evidence of multicollinearity in the combination model of fine-grained SC indices. The P-P diagram and standardized residual histogram of the combination model both exhibit a normal distribution, and the regression coefficient is significant $( p < . 0 5 )$ , indicating a good fit for the regression model. A comparison of $R ^ { 2 }$ values shows that the combined model explains $2 9 . 2 \%$ more of the writing score variance than the large-grained SC indices model, and $1 9 \%$ more of the writing score variance than the syntactic diversity model. In this section, we have offered a solution to the third question that was previously raised in the preceding text.

We find that MSTTRDR-30 effectively measures Chinese L2 writing qualities. The increased variety of syntactic structures in the writings of ECsL learners is positively correlated with higher writing cores. The fine-grained combination model includes not only the generic syntactic structures common to both Chinese and English, but also the special syntactic structures in Chinese. This indicates that GSC and CSC indices complement each other in capturing the L2 syntactic complexity of language production. When evaluating the L2 writing qualities L2 language evaluators should not only take into account the use of more complex syntactic structures, but also the basic syntactic structures employed in L2 writings.

Regarding common basic syntactic structures in Chinese and English, the frequency of atributive constructions can be seen as an indicator of the utilization of complex noun phrases. For example, the three complex noun phrase types mentioned in Lu and Wu (2022) areal marked with At i our annotation ystem. Thus, the presence ofattributers in the combinatorial model indicates that the usage of noun phrases can effectively predict the writing performance of ECSL learners. The decrease in the usage of parallelism is partly indicative of a decrease in the number of syntactic structures that ECsL learners use at the same level and with equal constituents, thus also explaining the increase in their writing performance. In addition, the drop in parallism is somewhat suggestive of a decrease in the number of syntactic structures utilized by ECsL students that have equivalent syntactic components, which could possibly account for the improvement in their writing qualities. Thus, the incorporation of Atr RATIO in the combined model indicates that the utilization of noun phrases can function as a predictor for the writing proficiency of ECSL learners. ECSL learners who achieve higher scores in writing tend to utilize a range of sophisticated linguistic modifiers, thereby manifesting a heightened level of complexity in the syntactic constructions of their sentences. The decrease in the usage of Coor partly signifies a reduction in the number of syntactic structures that ECSL learners use at the same level with equal constituents, thereby contributing to the improvement in their writing performance.

In the realm of Chinese-specific syntactic structures, several indices are of particular significance in evaluating the quality of Chinese 2 writing. These include the ratio of predicat-complement, the ratio of adjunct of sentence end, the ratio of numeral adjunct, and the mean length of Topic-Comment-Unit dependency distance. Furthermore, our findings suggest that TCMDD, which measures the dependency distance within the topic chain, holds greater predictive power for the performance of ECsL learners compared to MDD. This demonstrates that ECsL learners not only have the capability to produce longer topic chains but that the syntactic complexity of these topic chains also escalates as their Chinese writing proficiency improves. This further implies that syntactic complexity indices incorporating Chinese linguistic typological features provide a more comprehensive explanation of Chinese L2 writing quality and bettr capture the evolving characteristics of interlanguage. These indices, talored to the typological features of the target language, are bettr suited for reflecting these changes in interlanguage development. The predicate-complement structure in Chinese holds a unique position as an adverbial structure. According to the markednessdifferentil hypothesis (Eckman, 1977, the marked nature of the redicate-complement structure makes it more challenging for hinese L2 leaners to acquire (Hao et al., 2021b) The inclusion of Comp ratios in the SC combination model emphasizes the importance of Chinese L2 learners proficiency in handling complements, as it plays a significant role in assessing their Chinese writing quality.

# 6. Conclusions and implications

Based on asyntactically annotated Chinese L2 writing corpus, we investigated the relationship between syntactic complexity and writing quality of ECsL learners. We utilized a range of syntactic complexity indices at both the large and fine levels. Our analysis revealed that only T/S and C/TCU were included in the regression model, accounting for a mere $1 4 . 5 \%$ of the variance in Chinese writing scores. To address Question (4), we present the following summary. Among the large-grained indices, the GSC indice that effectively predicts the performance f Chinese  writing is the number of T-units per sentence, whil the C indice that efectively predicts the performance of Chinese L2 writing is the number of Clauses per topic chain unit In terms of fine-grained syntactic an. notated complexity indices, the syntactic diversity indice alone can explain $2 4 . 7 \%$ of the variance in writing scores. However, the combined model of fine-grained syntactic complexty and syntactic diversity indice, based on the syntactically annotated corpus, can explain $4 3 . 7 \%$ of the variance in holistic scores, demonstrating the strongest predictive power for Chinese L2 writing qualities in this study. This indicates that fine-grained syntactic complexity indices provide a more comprehensive explanation of L2 writing qualities. Specificall, the fine-grained GsC indices that have been found to effectively predict Chinese L2 writing qualities are S_RATIO, Atr RATIO, Cor RATIO and Sentobj_RATIO. Furthermore, Chinese-specific indices, including Esa RATIO, Comp_RATIO, Ma RATIO and the dependency distance of topic chains, have also been determined to effectively predict Chinese L2 writing performance.

The research findings presented above have significant implications both theoretically and practically. The large-grained and fine grained indices considered in the current study exhibit varying performances in predicting the quality of L2 Chinese writing. The more effective prediction of writing quality by fine-grained indices supports the notion that fine-grained indices empower researchers to identify specific syntactic constructions that aear to evolve at each developmental level (Kyle & Crossey, 2018). Our study results demonstrate that the combined use of GSC and CSC indices provides a proficient prediction of L2 writing proficiency. Therefore it is advisable to employ multidimensional syntactic complexity indices rather than a selective approach to conceptualize syntactic complexity in predicting the quality of second language Chinese writing (Lu & Wu, 2022; Norris & Ortega, 2009). Meanwhile, edu. cators must avoid an exclusive emphasis on certain specialized structures of the target language in the teaching proces. Simultaneously, there should be a reinforced focus on the usage of basic structures by L2 learners, ensuring acomprehensive and integrated approach to instruction. Syntactic diversity holds considerable potential in predicting the quality of L2 writing. Furthermore, the concurrent application of both syntactic elaboration and diversity indices yields a more holistic portrayal and understanding of syntactic complexity in its entirety. This supports and aligns with the perspective proposed by De Clercq and Housen (2017). This also implies that L tachers should explictly provide guidance to L2 learners on how to generate a greater variety of syntactic structures. Furthermore, our findings indicate that typological features inherent in the English native language, such as subject prominence and inflectional morphology, influence the syntactic complexity of EcsL learners. With regard to this particular discovery, Chinese teachers should guide ECst leaners to observe the structural similaries and differences between their native language and the target language (Chinese). When creating Chinese instructional materials, it is also essential to consider the native language factors of L2 learners and strive to develop more culturall tailored materials. Furthermore, our research data can be leveraged for machine learning or deep learning, thus enabling the ffective development of an automated scoring system for Chinese 2 writing. For instance, we may select linguistic features that exhibit a corrlation with manually assigned scores. By utilizing machine learning algorithms (such as support vector machines, random forests and neural networks) and identifying critical features, a more potent predictive model can be established (Mizumoto & Eguchi, 2023). This model has the potential to aid second language educators in more efectively under. standing the quality of writing and the development of L2 learners (Crossley, 2020).

While we have obtained some significant findings in ths study, we should also acknowledge the limitations of this research article First, our data only encompass essays written by L2 learners from one native language background (English) and within one genre (narratiesays). Consequently, it is challenging to ascertin whether these findings are applicableto writing in other genres or for learners from different linguistic backrounds, as both th ask genre (Qin & Uccell, 2016) and leaners native anguage backgrounds (Lu & Ai, 2015) can impact syntactic complexity in L2 writing. Therefore, in the future, we should expand our research to investigate the relationship between syntactic complexity indices in essays of various genres wrtten by Chinese L2 learners from diverse native language backgrounds and the quality of their writings. Second, as pointed out by one of the reviewers, the analysis in the study is conducted across score levels rather than across proficiency levels. Therefore, future resarch on the relationship between Chinese 2 writing quality and syntactic complexity indices should pay attention to longitudinal changes over time. For instance, future research could longitudinally track the syntactic complexity of writings produced by L2 learners, considering individual learners, over an extended period. Third, in terms of syntactic diversity, we have employed only the MSTTRDR-30 as a syntactic diversity indice for predicting the quality of Chinese2 writing in this article. In the future, we wl explore additional syntactic diversity indices that are suitable for assessing the quality of Chinese L2 writing.
