Adapting to anthropogenic climate change requires informed citizens capable of managing personal and societal risks. This study explores the contribution of climate change education (CCE) to build adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity. As defined by Grothmann and Patt's (2005) Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPAcC), cognitive dimensions of adaptive capacity correspond to climate change risk perception and adaptation appraisal as preconditions for individual adaptation actions. Their model has been operationalised to examine adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity in a pre-test-post-test design, and the educational programme Generation $F ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future is presented as a quasi-experiment linking this concept with CCE. Because cognitive adaptive capacity is a complex and multifaceted concept, this contribution also studies the influence of CCE on knowledge and thinking skills, which are important dimensions as well. Overall, 173 upper-secondary school students aged between 16 and 18 years actively collaborated with 57 scientific and practical experts on climate change adaptation (CCA) in North and South Tyrol. Additionally, the programme included control groups. Over two school years, Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 }$ Fit for Future encouraged students to follow constructivist inquiry-based CCE, and they carried out their own research-oriented CCA projects. A mixed methods approach compared data from a multivariate multilevel mixed model collected by web-based questionnaires $\left( \mathbf { N } \right) = 2 3 1 $ and qualitative data from problem-centred interviews $( \mathrm { N } = 4 7 )$ , which were analysed by documentary method. The results suggest a mismatch between quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data do not show any change in adolescents' risk perception and adaptation appraisal, but qualitative data reveal that intervention group students demonstrated increased levels of adaptation knowledge and elaborated critical as well as forward thinking skills. Control group students did not show such capacities after standard curriculum education. It is concluded that CCE holds potential to build several dimensions of adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity. Upcoming

# 1. Introduction

For decades, the scientific community has been providing unequivocal evidence of dangerous human interference with Earth's climatic system. From the beginning of the industrial age to the period 2006-2015, global mean land surface temperature has increased by $+ 1 . 5 3 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ triggering abnormally hot weather, droughts, heavy precipitation events and sea level rise (IPCC, 2019). Societies acrossthe globe are afected in manifold ways by these and other more indirect climate impacts and unmitigated warming makes them increasingly vulnerable (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016). In short some consequences like health issues or damage to infrastructure are unavoidable, and most national mitigation policies remain insufficient to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement (Rogel) et al., 2016). Thus, preventive and preparatory efforts must be taken to enhance peoples' adaptive capacity (i.e, the ability to moderate, or avoid harm from climate change consequences and to seize opportunities) (Thomas et al., 2018; UNFccc, 2015)

The literature also suggest that current young people are and will be more intensively challenged by observed and projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change than any other generation before (Corner et al., 2015, Hansen et al., 2017). Particularly, f business-as-usual warming continues over the coming decades, they could suffer from more intense hatwaves in cities, new spreading infectious diseases and unexpected social disruptions (Wats et al., 2018). Some impacts, however, canot be completely avoided even if current global mitigationefforts tu out tobe fully sucesul and for most of todays adaptation decisions, children and adlecents rely on adults (UNICEF, 2015). To minimise their specific vulnerabilit to climate-related risks, current and future young generations depend upon prompt mitigatio as well as adaptation actions alike by all global leaders, who, have, however, been failing for decades to act on climate scientists' warnings appropriately (Lawson et al., 2019).

# 1.1. Climate change adaptation and the role of education

In the face of an accelerating global climate crisis, it is vital to ask this question: What is the role of education in enhancing adaptation? According to a literature review from Leet al. (2020), the trust in science that climate change is happening among youth is high and similar to adults. However, there appears to be some disconnection between perceived effctivenes of individual climate actions and willingnes to act. Moreover, the understanding of mitigation or adaptation solutions among different members of youth is ofen reported to be superficial and includes misconceptions. To overcome this stuation, climate change education (CcE) and learning could serve as promising strategies for reducing adolescents future vulnerability to climate-related risks and can shape their capacity for taking adaptive actions (Kagawa and Selby, 2012). Beyond education that provides basic and numerical sills (Muttarak and Lutz, 2014), E, which is often more specific, provides understanding of the causes, effcts and consequences of anthropogenic climate change and helps to develop competencies to eventuall act climate-friendly (Anderson, 2012). CCE directly contributes to capacitybuilding (Lutz et al., 2014), for example by developing young learners systemic and holistic thinking sills and preparing them to better understand adaptation actions as well as their consequences for solving the global climate crisis. Fazey et al. (2007) similarly recognise this, arguing that knowing about impact of current behaviour, knowing about apropriate direction of change and knowing about how to achieve change can strengthen individual adaptive capacity.

More generall, the practice of CE directly contributes to realising synergies among the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especill between SDG 4 Quality Education' and SDG 13 Climate Action' (UNESCO, 2017). In this context, CCE may be treated as a direct investment in peoples' abilitis to understand climate-related risks with which they are likely to be confronted with, and potential adapttion measures they could undertake (Stiessnig et al., 2013). Furthermore, following a whole instittion approach, school infrstructure itelf could be made more resilient and safe against sit-specific climatic impacts and reduce its carbon footprints through better insulation and the use of renewable heating technologies (UNEsCO, 2016).

This paper draws from various disciplines, such as climate science, education and social psychology to argue that by providing situated and creative learning environments to adolescents (Whitney et al., 2017), CCE does far more than simply create knowledge about causes of global warming (Mochizuki and Bryan, 2015).In addition to promoting deper understanding of causes and climate response, CCE can foster cognitive competences that are useful for both future mitigation and adaptation actions, such as forwardlooking or the ability to recognise personal opportunities as well as barriers for a climate-resilient living (Ledley et al., 2017). According to Tschakert and Dietich (2010), the competences of uncovering underlying factors of vulnerabilit, creating visions for alternative futures, and avoiding maladaptation from an early stage, are strengthened by forward thinking. Furthermore, Anderson (2012) argues that adaptation to an uncertain future requires educational approaches that trengthen cognitive dimensions of adaptive capacity among individuals, such as the development of critical thinking and the ability to deal with unexpected climate-related risks.

Against this background, this contribution focuses on cognitive factors of adaptive capacity and the importance of learning in shaping them (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). It examines the influence of a two-year CCE programme on upper-secondary school students' cognitive adaptive capacity and thereby address several cognitive determinants including thinking skills. Thereby, the educational interventions provided by the educational programme and quasi-experiment Generation $F ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future are evaluated (see Background). As most adaptation research overloos cognitive phenomena at the individual level (Oakes et al., 2016), this experi mental study compares selected dimensions of cognitive adaptive capacity and competences of upper-secondary schoo students participating in the educational programme with control group students receiving standard curriculum education only.

# 1.2. Adaptive capacity, cognition and climate change education

Realised adaptations are understood as real-life manifestations of peoples' or systems' adaptive capacities and adaptive capacity refers to human abilitie to adjust topotential ngative consequences and toseek opportunities in anthropogenic climate change Smt and Wandel, 2006). At the individual level, adaptive capacity is shaped by more than technological, financial and social resources. These objective factors however do not entirely explain to what degree cognitive factors, such as knowledge, thinking sills climate risk perception and problem-solving competences determine individual adaptive capacity and how they mediate adaptation behaviour (van Valkengoed & Steg, 2019). To understand why some people perform beter in adaptation than others, Mortreux and Barnett (2017) studied additional psycho-social factors such as personal experience with adaptation, trust in authorities and belief in the effectiveness of adaptation measures. Furthermore, Adger et al. (2009) emphasise human cognition as a leverage point for solving adaption problems relevant to society. They argue that the ways in which individuals perceive their vulnerabilities and whether they belief in adaptation strategies (or not), have the potential to constrain collective adaptation efforts significantly.

This study builds on a framework from Grothmann and Patt (2005) that provides an elaborated understanding of how human cognition shapes individual adaptive capacity. Drawing in tun from Protection Motivation Thory (PMz) (Rogers 1983), their Modlf Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPAcC) includes two main cognitive dimensions that mediate private and proactive adaption, namely (1) climate change risk perception and (2) adaptation appraisal. The first dimension, climate change risk perception, explains how individuals perceive the likelihood of being exposed to climatic efects (so-called perceived probabilit) and how they judge consequences of climate change (so-called percived severity). For instance, individuals examine their exposure to  heatwave and judge the degree they could suffer from it. According to Slovic (1987), both kinds of percetions are preconditions for adequate risk response at the individual level. The second dimension, daptation appraisal, explains the degre to which adolescents believe in the effectiveness of adaptation measures in protecting them or others (so-called perceived adaptation eficacy) as well as their abilit to implement adaptation measures by themselves (so-calld percived selfefficacy). For instance, individuals appraise the relief that re sults from cooing behaviours during a heatwave and evaluate their ability to carry them out. Together, climate change risk perception and adaptation appraisal can enhance or constrain human adaptive capacity (Grothmann and Patt, 2005).

Previous research also reveals that basic understanding of climate change and knowledge for climate-response shape an individual's cognitive adaptive capacity. Understanding the ways in which humans are interfering with Earth's climatic system (cause-knowledge), comprehending direct and indirect consequences on human and natural systems (impact-knowledge) and understanding incremental and transformative adaptation translate to higher risk perception, as wel as stronger adaptation appraisal (van der Linden, 2015). There is also ample empirical evidence of knowledge and thinking sills shaping adaptation understanding and behaviour. Williams et al. (2015) show that knowledge of long-term climate change efects encourages people to take proactive approaches, and Oakes et al. (2016) reveal that knowing local environmental changes makes a difference in what adaptations are carried out by forest managers in order to anticipate climate-induced forest dieback in Alaska. Furthermore, findings from Esham and Garforth (2013) suggest cognition to be equally important as socio-economic factors in taking of adaptation measures in a farming community in Sri Lanka.

Both relevant theory and corresponding empirical works clearly indicate the importance of cognitive competencies for building adaptive capacity and demonstrate the potential role of CcE for preparing individuals fr carring out adaptation actions. This study links climate, educational and psychological research by hypothesizing that CCE directly contributes to building adolescents cognitive adaptive capacity t i believed that through learning adolecents cultivate their limate change risk percetions, adaptation appraisals, knowledge lvels and thinking skils all of which are important for beter understanding of climate change and the development of individual adaptive capacities (see Fig. 1).

# 1.3. Research questions and hypotheses

In examining adaptive capacity at the individual level, exceptionally different approaches can be taken Lockwood et al. (2015) and Engle (2011) encourages experimenting with novel methods to further investigate this complex concept. This study combines quantitative and qualitative methodologies to investigate several dimensions of upper-secondary chool students' cognitive adaptive capacity developed through inovative CE, as compared to control group students in standard currculum education. Because it remains open to debate in the context of education how to asessadaptive capacity at the individual level in a holisic and meaningful way, this study focuses only on the dimensions of knowledge, thinking kill, climate change risk pereption and daptation opraisal, and thereby ignores other dimensions like past experience with climate risks, reliance on public adaptation or fatalism. The decision to focus on these particular six dimensions was motivated by the educational design of Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future, which is very well in line with ste-of-the-art CCE teaching strategies according to Monroe et al. (2017), but did not address past experiences, rliance on public adaptation or fatalism systematically. Mixed research is further argued to be suitable for describing complex phenomena, such as cognitive adaptive capacity, and offets the weaknesses of each approach used by itslf (Johnson and Onwuegbuzie, 2004). In education and other fields such research designs are chosen for investigating challenging (and often fuzzy) questions that cannot be answered by one research paradigm alone (Leech and Onwuegbuzie, 2009). Against this background, this paper focuses on the superordinate research question: Can CCE contribute to building upper-secondary school students cognitive adaptive capacity?

Attempting to provide comprehensive answers, the inquiry process of this study takes two directions. Quantitative analysis ex amines the potential efects of CCE on upper-secondary schoo students' cognitive adaptive capacity at intervention and control group levels in terms of climate change risk perception and adaptation appraisa. No control group effcts are expected. The four research hypotheses are as follows:

: H1: CCE provided by Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 }$ Fit for Future will influence upper-secondary school students to increase their perceived probability of climate change.   
H2: CCE provided by Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future will influence upper-secondary school students to increase their perceived severity of climate change effects.   
. H3: CCE provided by Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future will influence upper-secondary school students to increase their perceived adaptation efficacy.   
: H4: CCE provided by Generation $F ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future will influence upper-secondary school students to increase their perceived selfefficacy.

To complement hypothesis testing, a qualitative method is followed to investigate the degre to which upper-secondary school students show knowledge and thinking sill after CCE, which are important dimensions of cognitive adaptive capacity on their own (Fazey et al., 2007, Stevenson et al., 2017) and partly feed into Grothmann and Patt's (2005) climate change risk perception and adaptation appraisal. Intervention group students' knowledge of CCA and thinking skill aftr CCE are investigated through problemcentred interviews and compared to the results from control group students in standard curriculum education. The research ques. tion used in the documentary analysis of transcripts from problem-based interviews is as follows: What difernces in adaptation knowledge and thinking skils can be observed between uper-scondary school students after CCE (intervention group) and uper-econdary school students after standard curriculum education (conrol group)? In a final step, quantitative and qualitatie findings are comparatively discussed to find robust answers to the superordinate research question. It is important to note that this research question is novel, and cognitive adaptive capacity is to our understanding still unexplored in CCE research.

# 2. Background: The research-education cooperation Generation $F ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future as a means of active and participatory CCE in North Tyrol (Austria) and South Tyrol (Italy)

According to Gobiet et al. (2014), projected 21st-century climate change in the European Alps wl lead to manifold impacts which are expected to challenge adaptive capabilities of Alpine communities. Against this background, from 2017 to 2019, the research-education cooperation Generation $F ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future initiated a science society collaboration on adaptation problems in North Tyrol (Austria and South Tyrol (Italy) between 173 upper-secondary students (between 16 and 18 years old, grades lels 5-7 in the secondary level II of the Austrian education system), 57 adaptation experts from within and outside of academia and five uppersecondary school teachers. All teachers taking over responsibility in the project and helping to organise the educational in. terventions were also involved in the development of the project proposal. Intervention and control group clases participated in the educational project voluntarily. A community of learners between teachers, students and adaptation experts (Rogoff, 1994) was developed and implemented at four dierent secondary school for two consecutive scho0l years (2017/18 and 2018/19) with two separate cohorts of intervention group students. The research-education cooperation followed a moderate-constructivist approach, which means that learning processes have started with students' individual conceptions of CCA (Keller et al., 2019) and real-life adaptation problems were an essntial part of the education design. Applying inquiry-based learning (see final paragraph of this section), upper-secondary school students discovered climate-specific vulnerabilities and adaptation behaviours in diffrent societl sectors in their home regions, such as the economy, health sector, agriculture, forestry, tourism and infrastructure. The students developed their own research questions and were supported by experts and teachers in investigating adaptation among different societal groups, such as farmers, tourism managers, and private households. Participating in CCE, intervention group students coproduced original and place-specific knowledge for adaptation in North and South Tyrol (Cutter-Mackenzie and Roussel, 2019). All in all, Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 }$ Fit for Future is expected to have supported intervention group students building both their climate change risk perceptions and adaptation appraisal longside with thir knowledge for adaptation and thinking competences relevant for understanding adaptation actions. Control group students received standard curriculum education and did not actively participate in the CCE intervention.

Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future is treated as a pilot experiment testing a CCE approach tailored to the topic of adaptation (see Fig. 2). Throughout both study years, the quality of the educational intervention has bee steadily improved by applying a hermeneuticircle (Kezar, 2000). In the first year, the authors developed an understanding of the effectiveness of their education to build adolescents cognitive adaptive capacity by engaging with intervention group students. In the second yer i order to incrase it effctiveness, the educational programme was adapted and refined acording to an external evaluation and the irst empirical analysis of intervention

group students' learning outcomes (see Schrot et al., 2019).

Overall, the educational programme featured seven in-school workshops (each 100 min long) while two additional expert work shops (full day) offered pace for extensive collaboration betwee students and adaptation experts (Moser, 2014). The interventions started at the beginning of each school year and were evenly spread over al months until the end of the school year to establish a routine for the students. In-school workshops strictl followed the inquiry learning cycle as described by Pedaste et al. (2015), and members of the project team and experts acompanied the students' learning proceses There were continues meetings between the project team and the teachers and they were assisted in redesigning their own leons. At first, the intervention aimed at creating curiosity about CCA among the participating students (Orientation) and starting to develop their own research questions relevant to their home-regions (Conceptualization). During the next step, experts supported students i finalising their research concepts (content and method), and the students sarted collecting empirical data in their comunities (Investigation). Students then analysed their data answered their research questions (Conclusions). In a inal event and in follow-up meetings they presented and discussed their research outcomes publicly (Discussion) with high-profil regional stakeholders (Roland Psenner, the president of Eurac Research Bolzan; Arnold Kompatscher, the head of the province of South Tyrol; and Markus Reiterer, the secretary general of the Alpine Convention) (see Fig. 3).

To build upper-secondary school students' cognitive adaptive capacity, the educational interventions amed at raising awareness about existing and expected consequences of anthropogenic climate change in North and South Tyrol. Interventions included scientific key note presentations and discussions, adaptation role-plays and, in particular, dealt with questions how to do research and present scientific ruts usig cntii strs (e g.2).limate chnge risk petion has bddressed, linking climat-relatd riss with human vulnerabilities in communities and different economic sectors. Adaptation appraisal has been targeted by discussing temporal aspects of adaptation strategies and the efectivenes of different adaptation behaviours. During the two expert workshops, students were given the opportunity to identify and discuss climate change impacts in their home regions as well a adaptation solutions, hich has addressed climate change risk percetion and daptation appraa. While doing their ownresearch on CCA, the adolescents needed to think systematically and dealt with the most common state-of-the-art knowledge on climate change risks and had to reflect upon incremental and transformational adaptation options.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Research design and sampling

The study employed a quasi-experimental design (Horn et al., 2009), and taking a psychometric pproach for the quantitative part of the investigation was particularly motivated by Lockwood et al. (2015). Data were collcted before and after CCE and standard curriculum intervention. After the removal of outliners and missing data due to absences a the day of pre- and/or post-test, the final sample for the quantitative analysis comprised 133 upper-secondary school students participating in CCE over one school year each (intervention group) and 98 uper-secondary school students fllowing standard curriculum education (control group) over one scool year each. The students (56 percent female) came from two secondary schoos in North Tyrol (Austria) and two secondary schools in South Tyrol (Itly). ll were German-speaking. Students were not randomised because reallif classituations had to be maintained. Qualitative analysis used a much smaller sample. The interviews were conducted with intervention group students $\left( N = 2 5 \right)$ and control group students $( N = 2 2$ ) from both study years. The interview sample, however, was randomized to avoid that only students with high motivation or interest in climate change were interviewed.

# 3.2. Quantitative analysis and data collection

A web-based survey was developed to study intervention and control group students cognitive adaptive capacity (Alessi and Martin, 2010). Items were operationalised acording to Grothmann and Pat's (2005) MPPAAC and addressed the dimensions of cognitive adaptive capacity dealing with climate change risk percetion and adaptation apraisal, each dimension having two sub dimensions, namely (a) perceived probabiliy, (b) peceived severity, (c) perceived adaptation efficacy and (d) perceived self-fficacy. The wording of the items did not come from another study because there is no comparable study on the nexus between adaptation and CCE using more standardised items. Confirmatory factor analysis was then applied to determine if the measured variables represent the four selected dimensions (see Table 2, Annex). For each dimension of cognitive adaptive capacity, the internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha was calulated. Cronbach's alpha for the three perceived probabilit items was 0.72, and for the thre perceived severity itms 0.5. Moreover, Cronbach's alha for the four pereived dapttionefficacy items was 0.59, and for the four prceive selfefficacy itms 0.78. A multilevel rgression model was designed and combined alltreatment and control classe for each year. Time (pre-test & post-post) and the group (intervention & control) were treated as fixed ffects in the model, whereas the schools were treated as a random effect In a final te, the pre-post differences withi treatment and contrl groups and pre-post differences betwen intervention and control groups were measured using a statistical t-test. Significance level was $\mathtt { p } \le 0 . 0 5$ . The intervention is expected to result in an increase in the individual outcome variables from the pre-test to the post-est in the intervention group, but not in the control group. Therefore a baseline was defined, which represents the overall model of an outcome variable without the interaction term intervention $\times$ post-test. For each outcome variable, the overall model was compared with this baseline.

# 3.3. Qualitative analysis and data collection

According to Engle (2011), adaptive capacity is a latent construct, which means it must be mobilised prior to measurement. To complement the web-based survey, problem-centred interviews (Witzel, 2000) were designed to make upper-secondary schoo students knowledge of CCA and thinking skils visible. It is important to note that the interviews were also constructed to provide more background information on students' risk perception and adaptation appraisal The interviews were semi-structured and encouraged students to report about and reflct upon real-life adaptation issues in ther home reions. Students could choose from the topics a far apart as tourism, agriculture, health and natural hazards, each presenting typical climate-related riss for North and South Tyrol. By questioning and re-questioning, students were asked to identify societal vulnerabilities as wellas climate change impacts and were asked to discuss adaptation behaviours associated with the chase chosen (see Table 3, Annex). In the interviews, cientific graphs and photos of such adaptation behaviours were used to make their understanding of the adaptation process more explicit (Richard and Lahman, 2015). After the interviews were transcribed verbatim, the intervention and control group findings were analysed and contrasted using documentary method. Interview data were collcted and codes were developed as wellas analysed by two authors. Before analysis, the transcripts and codes were given to other authors of the study to perform an inter-coder reliability check.

Documentary method is a frequently used method in qualitative social research to reconstruct meaning from interview tran. scriptions (Nohl, 2017) and employed three analytical phases. The formulating nterpretation summarized content and asked, What is the text about?'. Then, the reflectig interpretation asked, How is the problem dealt with?' and clarified descriptions as well as argu. mentations demonstrated by the interviewee. In a final ste, all findings from intervention and control group students were ompared and more generalized types of tudents cognitive adaptive capacity were identified (Nohl, 2010). Interview codes were the same for the intervention and control group, and were developed according to the selected dimensions of cognitive adaptive capacity. For example, if a respondent talked about the plausibility of climate change impacts in their surroundings, and how people could be affected by them, his or her answer was coded as to perceived probabiliy and perceive severity. If this person was then able to name potential adaptation actions and could differentiate between their relative effectiveness the answer was coded as to knowledge and perceived dpttionefficacy. And, if h r she was criticl r naive aout different adapttion techques or behaviours, this was coded as to thinking skils. Martens and Asbrand (2009) argued for documentary method as a valid tool to evaluate a person's cognitive performance, and in ths study the method was used to reconstruct upper-econdary school students cognitive abilities for adaptation after CE intervention or standard curriculum education. It is important to note that the qualitative analysis is more than a focus on straightforward knowledge or high-order thinking sils asssment. Next to so-called objective codes (i.e. the researchers' constructions of common themes after comparative analysis), i also emphasizes the climate change understanding of the interviewees.For example, the reflective analysis examined, if respondents were able to outline meaningful connections between their own lives or the lives of family members with current adaptation challenges in North or South Tyrol as well a their personal feelings he or she had had during the educational project.

# 3.4. Triangulating survey and interview findings

A triangulation of survey and interview findings in the discussion section should avoid misinterpretations between group effcts and individual efets (Kemper, 2008). Moreover, it provides a crosschek of findings (Byman, 2006), as the mesurement of adaptive capacity involves uncertainty per se (Adger and Vincent, 2005).

# 4. Results

4.1. Upper-secondary school students' cognitive adaptive capacity after climate change education versus standard curiculum education in the first year and second year based on the quantitative data analysis

In both study years, statistical analysis showed no significant pre-post differences in perceived probabilit among intervention group students (see Fig.4). Therefore, H1 is rejected. There were also no significant pre-post differences in perceived severity among inter vention group studnts in both study years (se Fig. 5). Therefore, H2 i rected. There were alsono signficant pre-ost differences in adaptationefficacy among intervention group students in both years (see Fig. 6). Therefore, H3 is rejected. And, there were no sig. nificant pre-post diffrences in perceived self-fficacy among intervention group students in both year (se Fig. 7). Therefore, H4 is rejected. As expected, there were also no significant pre-post differences among control group students in both years. Overall,the quantitative results suggest that the educational interventions provided by Generation $F ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future did not result in higher climate change risk perceptions and adaptation appraisal among students. In other words, these two dimensions of cognitive adaptive capacity remained stable, and nodifference was found between the overal model and the baseline for any outcome variable. The random effects suggest variance between the students but no variance between schools (see Table 1).

4.2. Intervention group students' cognitive adaptive capacity after climate change education based on the qualitative data analysis

The interview results showed that CCE has strengthened most intervention group students' knowledge about climate change risks and understanding about adaptation options. Within the intervention group sample, 21 out of 25 students recognised that climate change poses major risks and they knew about ifferent limatic impacts already occurring in or expected for their home regions. They also showed profound levels of action knowledge for effective adaptation strategies. It was also found that many intervention group students were able to ink climate-related vulnerabilities with adaptation measures, and they could reflect upon their outcomes.

Interviewer: Which groups of people in Bolzano could be affected by summer heat?   
A13: Probably the older population, because of health I dont want to throw them all nt the same pot, but health prolems increase with   
age."

Interviewer: What can they do now to adapt to heat waves?

A13: A fan could cool the air, or an air conditioner. Maybe, the municipality of the city could make something like this available to the citizens. I think there are even cooled rooms in Bolzano, that are available for the older people when it gets hot.

Interviewer: What can be done to adapt Tyrolean tourism to the negative and positive consequences of climate change? Do you know of different means of adaptation?

A24: It would be generly smarter not to push so strongly for winter torism anymore. In our rgion, winter tourism is esentil, and if the warming continues it could collpse. So, I would focus more on other seasons, not winter, but summer, and promote cycling or hiking activities instead. This hels to deal wth a warmer climate, like a summer tourism with lkes and so on and focus n that Itis imortant to start a slow transition when winter tourism beomes smaller. Netheles snowmking is almost nessary and people will continue doing it as long as possible. You cannot stop the winter tourism all at once.

Moreover, another interesting finding dealing with adaptation efficacy was that most intervention group students could differentiate between autonomous and planed adaptions as well s limitations of both strategie.In this context, some students understood that the capacity to adapt is shared unequall across ifferent stakeholder groups, so they claimed that more holistic adaptation measures would be essential to reduce harm. A corresponding interview sequence is as follows:

Interviewer: What is your assessment of adaptation to natural hazards for people living in the mountains?

A2: Well, think they re good n usting to nt azard. For exaple, yo anrotet yourself using ndag o  ulding the house on stronger gound so that is not washed way. Thinking f deris flow and rods, a priate person cannot d so much. The province of Tyrol or the muncipalit must make sure that the slopes are protected so that there is no chance f  deris flow. So, they must think ahed nd not wait to act until it is too late.

Beyond knowledge about adaptation, 16 out of the 25 interviewed intervention group students showed critical thinking skils Compared to control group students, they also recognised dilemmas caused by adaptation more ofen. Specificll, they were critical about adaptation actions that are maladaptive, and they were also found to think of benefits and costs of different adaptation measures. Furthermore, many intervention group students reflcted on barriers to adaptation in their home reions and the adptation fficacy of certain stakeholder groups. Two representative interview sequences are as follows:

Interviewer: What can people in Bolzano do to adapt to heat stress? A6: I sugest climate protecion now, so that global warming does not get any worse. They could use air conditioning in houses or cars. Of course, this is counterproductive because then more $C O _ { 2 }$ will be emitted again and that is against climate change.

Interviewer: What was your most important research finding?

A20: Specificall, in tems of subsidies, that the farmers are supported by the goverment, who now verystrongly need to rethink their practices. For example farmers in the lowlands who are switching rom appl to kiwi or ther exotic fruit. For the winegrowers it's only a matter of the varieties, but for the fruit growers, they must completely change fruits. That's a greater burden for them.

Problem-solving for adaptation requires forward-thnking skils. Comparative analysis suggests that 11 out of the 25 interviewed intervention group students demonstrated forward-thinking skill, such as flexible thinking or the anticipation of long-term risks. n ther words, those students could recognise differences between pro- and re-active adaptation and their outcomes for climate risk management. Two corresponding interview sequences are as follows:

Interviewer: How can we adapt to the consequences of climate change?

A18: In the event f floding, you can uld dams or  kind of retention basin. You can argue about whether t should be rifical or natural. In any case, yu should make sure in ace tht notsomuch is built i risk areas. If there are ouses, the the people there proably dont want to leave. But they should no longer be allowed to build there.

Interviewer: In setlement planning you can prevent and identify risk zones where construction is not taking place, or you can create awareness for residents. What are the advantages and disadvantages here?

A23: Risk zones are very important in my opinion, because everything that can be presented should be done in any case. Because if fooding occurs, you can save a o of money, and you dont need to reconstruct thing. In any case, both meures must be combined so that residents are supported in adapting to climate change.

1.3. Control group students cognitive adaptive capacity after standard curiculum education based on the qualitative data analysis

The following results shows significant differences to those in the intervention group. 14 out of the 22 interviewed control group students showed limited or no knowledge about climate-related risks or adaptation options in North or South Tyrol. Many control group students also lacked specific intellectual resources to develop nuanced responses to the challenge of managing climate-related riss in North and South Tyrol suggesting that their climate change risk perceptions and adaptation appraisals were very low compared to intervention group. Two representative interview sequences are as follows:

Interviewer: Now, we have tlked about the irs graph and th trend of extreme weather, and we have talked about concern. Now it's about how to react and how to adapt. What do you think farmers can do? Do they already know how to adapt? C3: I don't know any. But I also think the two pictures with the irrigation here just show that it is getting drier.

Interviewer: What do you think these groups of people can do now to adapt to heat?   
C12: Adaptation will be hard. I don't know if i is possible for farmers to do their work later in the day when it's les hot.   
Interviewer: Any other measures in the adjustment that you know of or that come to mind?   
C12: No. In my view, it would be beter to do omething against climate change. But not just the individual also others, and then they won't have to adapt. Then things will change on their own.

10 of the 22 interviewed control group students held various misconceptions about the causes of climate change and addressed maladaptation less critically. Many control group students confused adaptation measures with environmental protection, and demonstrated an understanding of climatic effects expected for their home regions that is not in line with findings from climate research for North or South Tyrol. Two interview sequences are as follows:

Interviewer: What might this warming of the climate mean for winter and summer tourism in North Tyrol? B2: If I amrigh, I think it snows aot because of climate change. Becuse more water condense, and so erything must go down again, so to speak, and then, of course, it snows a lot. And that's very good for tourism in Tyrol.

Interviewer There are two measures for adapttion. ne isto by an ir condtioner, s you said, or the other is to use the bike to go ontrips to cooler places to refresh yourself. Do you think there are any advantages or disadvantages to these two measures? C13: Yes, the main problem withir conditioning is the cost of elctricity, and travellin i en more expensive. Going to the mountins in South Tyrol is not that far, but to travel to other places, that's more expensive to get into a cooler environment.

11 of the 22 interviewed control group students showed examples of simplistic hinking. Specifically, they appeared to be unaware of the complexities as well s risks of limate change and addresd the realities f daptation in North and South Tyrol les critically. or instance, many control group students argued that adaptation would be purely a question of financial rsources, which sugests that their adaptation apraisal was not well informed and they were les aware of the urgency of adaptation in North or South Tyrol. Furthermore, some control group students showed wishful hinking, arguing that adaptation only takes place after a real disaster has occurred, which is rather naive ppraisal of adaptation since adaptation also could occur in advance of climate-related impacts. Two interview sequences are as follows:

Interviewer: What do you think people in winter tourism can do to adapt to the consequences of climate change? C15: I think they can't reall do much. Of ourse, you can advertis the type of tourism you are doing. But if you don't have the financil means, it's hard. And people always prefer to follow the masses instead of coming up with their own ideas.

Interviewer: Do you mean that you can't do a lot to adapt tourism to climate change?   
C15: Yes, I believe that if you don't have the financial means, then not really, no.   
Interviewer: When you think of inhabitants of mountainous areas, and it isassumed that naturalhazards wll increase because of climate change, how do you assess the ability of these people to adapt?   
B3: Yes, thr aies are differnt In the ng t ll ls e diffil,  ge, t afer tht, p wllbe a o ad umans are always adapting. That has always been so, I think.

# 5. Discussion

This study examined the role of CCE and inquiry-based learning in shaping selected dimensions of adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity. The quantitative data sugest that the educational inerventions did not result in any meaningful changes in intervention group stdnts clite chnge risk ption r dtion ol. Qalitived, hwer, delivr  diffeent ptre. It ows that most intervention group students were able to demonstrate sophisticated knowledge about adaptation to climate-related risks, had developed critcal as wellas forward thinking competences. In contrast, control group students revealed lesreflexive thinking and held various misconceptions about climate change and adaptation.

The qualitative results from this study confirm Stevenson et al. (2018), who showed that educational intervention increases climate-specific knowledge among adolescents. Results also indicate that, afer CCE, most intervention group students reached several cognitive larning objectives for SDG 13 Climate Action'. These students knew about major ecological, social, cultural and economic consequences of climate change locall, and about adaptation strategies at different levels and in various contexts (UNesco, 2017) While most intervention students showed action knowledge for adaptation, and reflected upon maladaptation criticall, some did not acquire such understanding or competences. This could be explained by the constructivist educational deign itself, which allowed for a high degre of autonomous learning. As a consequence, some intervention students chose to work on topics rather connected to mitigation than adaptation ssues. Working at eye-level throughout the intervention, educators avoided strong control on topics, but, instead, attempted to bridge mitigation and adaptation strategies in a meaningful way (Keller et al., 2019).

Interview findings from this study also sugest that CCE holds considerable potential to enhance the dimensions of adolescents cognitive adaptive capacity that relate to higher-order thinking. In specific, intervention group students showed higher degrees of critical and forward thinking after CCE. This confirms the indings of Wamsler (2011), according to whom such cognitive skills help people to better assesspublic information on climate riss, and safeguard a more profound selection of risk reduction measures. Interestingly, intervention group students were more flexible in addressing different real-life adaptations, and could reflect in more detail on advantages and disadvantages of both incremental and transformative measures than control group students. Such under. standing of adaptation strategies is crucial, since many adaptation practices in students' home regions, such as artificial snow. production (North Tyrol) and air-conditioning (South Tyrol) are incremental, and probably are not suitable anymore under more extreme climatic conditions the world is heading towards. Therefore, these findings underline the argument by Cinner et al. (2018) that individuals with higher cognitive flexbility are etter at adapting in terms that they are les likely to adopt maladaptation. Other educational programmes on adaptation are therefore strongly advised to focus on capacity-building that synthesises mitigation and adaptation, and to include critical discussions about the status-quo of adaptation realities.

This study demonstrates mismatches between quantitative and qualitative results. Thus, there is no support for al four hypotheses among intervention group students. The missing changes in climate change risk perception or adaptation oppraisal among intervention group students shown by the quantitative data may be explained by at least three factors: (a) the quality of educational design of Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future, (b) the operationalisation of the newly designed items for the questionnaire, or (c) the high complexity and latent character of the cognitive adaptive capacity concept itelf. Regarding ducational qualit, it is highlighted that the chosen focus on constructivis inquiry-based learning as well as the learning content are very much in line with stae-f-the-art CCE literature and practice. For example, the in-school and expert workshops led to active engagement of the participants, who could interact with scientists in a community-of-learners-approach. Following inquiry-based learning theory, the participants were encouraged to leave their lassroom world behind, and to explore adaptation realities in their home regions actively by themselves (Monroe et al., 2017). What is aso true, however, is that a lot of time had to be inested in order to create the inquiry-based learning and reseach situation for the students, beause they had had no experience in this whatsover (se Fig 2). Another limitation might arise from theffct that, although most intervention group students performed their own research about stakeholders who do real-life adaptation in North and South Tyrol, this does not necessrily mean that their personal roles or perceptions of adaptation were addressed. This explanation, however, conflicts with the qualitative finding that intervention group students were well aware about the fact that climate change is posing a major threat to North and South Tyrol (risk perception) and that they could autonomously asses the effectiveness of various adaptation measures pesented in the problem-centred interviews (adaptation oppraisal. The missing efectivenes of CCE to increase intervention group students' perceived probabilit could also be explained by findings from Kuthe et al. (2019). In their study, approximately 75 percent of 792 upper-secondary schol students (between 13 and 16 years old) from schools in Germany and Austria already showed medium to higher levels of climate change awareness before CCE. On the other hand, the missing signal in the quantitative data could also be the result of the items wordings used in the questionnaire. As mentioned before, they had to be newly designed because there were nostandardise items for measuring cognitive adaptive capacity in the context of education. This leads to the conclusion that ther reearch istrongly recommended to aessthe quality of the items presented in this experimental study and to further develop them. A third line of argumentation for the mismatch between the quantitative and qualitative data is that it could be attributed to the complex and latent nature of cognitive adaptive capacity itslf, which had been reported by Oakes et al. (2016) before. In other words, rearchers could be limited in measuring cognitive adaptive capacity until it i realised or mobilised within people (Engle, 2011). To overcome this limitation in adaptation science, a triangulation between quantitative and qualitative data is encouraged, and the interview data of this study are probably more direct proxies of students' dimensions of cognitive adaptive capacity than questionnaire data. In problem-based interviews, people need to expres their cognitive resources through explaining, analyzing or evaluating (iders, 2019). In the context given, qualitative data might thus reveal more reliable findings that quantitative data.

Methodologicall, further limitations are acknowledged as well. As recommended by Engle (2011), four dimensions of upper secondary schoo students cognitive adaptive capacity were measured ex-ante and ex-post, whereas two dimension of the interview were measured ex-post only. The development of the quantitative and qualitative measurement tols had ben challenging, since the operationalisation of the six dimensions of adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity suffered from a lack of established items or standardized examples of semi-structured intrviews. The authors followed Grothmann and Patt's (2005) framework and other studies like Anderson (2012) to develop their own items (see Table 2, Annex) since other field-tested items from Lockwood et al. (2015) or Koerth et al. (2013) did not fit ths studys purpose. Because uncertainty is part of the concept of adaptive capacity and its ssessment (Adger and Vincent, 2005), a mixed methods approach was undertaken, and it i also recommended to other researchers to address this fuzzy concept from as many diffrent perspectives as possible, and to look at both quantitative and qualitative data.

In terms of significance, two open questions about CCE by Reid (2019) were addressed by this quasi-experimental study: (a) In research terms, what has ben overlooke, omitted wel understood, or would be generative for CCE? (p.973) and (b) Must CCE research be designed in ways that make a difference to those adaptigto and mitigating climate change (p.975)? Frameworks like the MPPACC from Grothmann and Patt (2005) and empirical findings from Wamsler (2011) as wellas Striesnig et al. (2013) are claimed to be overlooked by contemporary CCE reearch. Specifically, itis argued that the above-mentioned cros-discilinary thories and findings from associated empirical research can provide valuable hints for operationalising key concepts of climate science (like adaptive capacity) for CCE resarch and better characterizations of the nexus between adaptive capacity, human cognition and lerning. Furthermore, the literature part of this contribution suggests that CCE should empower those who willbe most affcted by impacts of climate change, especially today's adolescents or children. It is the responsbility of all generations to mitigate climate change to avoid business-asusual warming, whilst investing in people's risk perceptions, knowledge levels, thinking sils and understanding by education.

The empirical asessments provided by this contribution are of importance for societal stakeholders in Austia, Italy and beyond, who are interested in inquiry-based capacity-building for adaptation among young people. For example, regional programmes financed by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, such as KEM (Klima- und Energiemodelregionen) and KLAR! (Klimawandelanpassungrgionen), in which children and adolescents lean about climate change risks and adaptation on a reular basis, can benefit from the educational design of the pilot experiment Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 }$ -Fit for Future, and could learn from its positive outcomes, and also its limitations.

# 6. Conclusion

This study clearly demonstrates a mismatch between quantitative and qualitative results. The quantitative data do not show any change in adolescents' climate change risk perceptions and adaptation appraisal in a pre-post-comparison before and afer CE intervention. The qualitative data, however, reveal a different picture: Upper-secondary schol students participating in Generation ${ \boldsymbol { F } } ^ { 3 } .$ Fit for Future were found to show increased level f adtation knowledge as wellas elaborated critical and forward thinking kill afer the educational intervention. Control group students did not show such capacities ater standard currculum education. Respecting the limitations of this study, it is concluded that CCE holds potential to build several dimensions of adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity. However, mixed research approaches - including both quantitative and qualitative data - and the integration of further perspectives of the adaptive capacity theory should be respected by upcoming research to study this complex concept. Adopting the central ideas of this study regarding both the challenging (quantitative) and the promising (qualitative) empirical asesment, can be a decisive step forward in linking cognitive adaptive capacity theory and CCE. At the same time, the long-term challenge of delivering solid research results intead of just giving anecdotal evidence' (UNEsco, 2012) on the functioning of Education for Sustainable Development and CCE, can be overcome.
