# Abstract

This paper has a two-fold aim: first, to report on some findings as to the ways in which textbook authors construe their argument in the introductory chapters to linguistics textbooks; second, to discuss some concerns which are central to descriptions of academic prose and register variation in the light of what the data under study provide us with.

The paper compares the introductory chapters taken from 10 textbooks in linguistics, i.e. general introductions for undergraduate students, and stresses both peculiarities and commonalities. A keyword analysis of the corpus reveals repeated linguistic behaviour which can shed light on how a register is constructed. Special emphasis is put on features like processes, modal adjuncts, logical connection and interpersonal pronouns signalling the argumentative dialogue that, though implicit, construes the writer as teacher/researcher, and the readership as students and/or members of the scientific community. As a result of the analysis carried out, it emerges that variation between the individual argumentative styles of each textbook writer included in the corpus, more than overall registerial variation, takes place.

# 1. Introduction

The present study aims to describe the ways in which argumentation is constructed in a small corpus of introductory chapters to linguistics textbooks with a view to answering the question of whether a register or functional variety is identifiable and, if so, how it is realized, and what its characteristic features are.

As a working definition of argumentation, I will quote Toulmin’s later reinterpretation of his own ideas originally presented in the famous 1958 work that saw a movement away from logic and rationalism, toward more procedural/pragmatic, activity-based approaches to the study of argumentative structure. He defines arguing as

Not the formal knitting of ‘propositions’, but an activity (or class of activities) which involves human agents of many kinds, acting in varied situations, in which different things are at stake when rival opinions are compared and evaluated (Toulmin, 1992: 7).

In other words, with such a definition, he emphasizes the social side of argumentation and the need to reappropriate rhetoric and all those non-analytical1 elements of the reasoning process, such as, for example, contextual and field-specific factors together with the effects on the target audience (this latter aspect is also fundamental in Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca’s (1989) New Rhetoric2 ).

Elements signalling the argumentative structure are variously ascribed in the literature to the plane of discourse sometimes called metadiscourse (Crismore, Markkanen, & Steffensen, 1993 elaborating on Hyland, 1999, 2000, 2002a,b; Vande Kopple, 1985), or else the plane of evaluation (Hunston, 1994; Hunston & Thompson, 2000; Thompson & Ye, 1991), whose main function is to express the writer’s opinion and value–system together with their attitude to both their material and their audience, to construct and maintain writer-reader relations and to organize the discourse (Hunston & Thompson, 2000: 6; Hyland, 2000: 104).

Studies such as Myers (1992) from the standpoint of sociology, and Hyland (2000) have focused on the writer–reader relationship in academic genres, showing how in textbooks this is constructed primarily, though not exclusively, as an expert–novice relationship. This is achieved through both textual and interpersonal meta-discourse aimed at elucidating propositional connections, clarifying content and informing. Highlighting the interrelation between social practice and written texts, Hyland (2000: 107) shows how rhetorically more complex the writer-audience relationship is, in that textbooks represent an important example of insider discourse, where writers are engaged with multiple audiences. Cross-disciplinary variation in various academic genres/registers is the focus of other corpus-based studies such as Bondi (1999, 2001) who has explored the discourse of economics.

Little has been written on the language of linguistics, apart from Tadros’ (1993) study of one aspect of interaction between writer and reader, namely text averral and attribution in three different texts, drawn, respectively, from the fields of linguistics, sociolinguistics and discourse analysis.

This paper focuses on the language linguists use, particularly on the rhetoricoargumentative choices made by textbook writers in introducing the fundamentals of linguistics and in engaging with their readership.

# 2. Data and methodology

The computer-readable corpus, which was processed using the Wordsmith Tools suite of programmes (Scott, 1996/1997), has approximately 161,000 words and consists of the introductory chapters taken from Aitchinson (herafter AIT), Akmajian et al. (AKMA), Brown (BRO), Crystal (CRY), Lyons (LYO), Radford et al. (RAD), Robins (ROB), Wallwark (WAL), Widdowson (WID) and Yule (YUL).3 A breakdown of the corpus together with the relative number of words are given in Table 1.

Which were the criteria applied in corpus design, or, to use statisticians’ terminology, what was the sampling frame?4

The textbooks were collected according to criteria such as availability, prestige and ideology. They were intended to be general introductions to linguistics for undergraduate students who are new to the subject. By availability literally meant books that are easily available in University or British Council libraries, which was taken as a sign of their being present as set texts in the reading lists of official academic courses. The textbooks were not chosen strictly on the basis of their prestige. However, the numerous reprints of some of these, their continuing market value, demonstrate their success and authority. Finally, their ideology, meaning the school of thought from which they stem,5 although in some cases this was known to me a priori, was not systematically taken into account. Conversely, introductions to subfields of linguistics such as pragmatics, semantics, sociolinguistics, or even to specific schools, such as, for instance, introductions to systemic–functional linguistics were not considered to provide a representative sample and were therefore excluded.

Only the introductory chapters were then selected. The number of these, however, tends to vary on the basis of the length of the textbook and according to the overall organisation of each individual author. They range from the first two to first three chapters, but occasionally they are limited to just the first one. I no longer consider those as introductory chapters which dealt with each individual stratum of language and the corresponding levels of linguistic description such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics, judging these to belong to the body of the book. The rationale for choosing to limit the analysis to only the introductions of the textbooks is discussed at the beginning of Section 3.2.

Wordsmith Tools (Scott, 1996/1997), which, as already mentioned, is the tool used to process the corpus, enable the user to identify and compute recurrent patterns in a text or a bunch of texts. Output includes frequency lists, concordance lines and keywords retrieval, that is identification of lexical items whose keyness is associated to their frequency within a text, as compared with their frequency in a reference corpus (Scott, 1997, 2001a,b).

The implication is that in looking for recurring patterns, one necessarily has to embark on some statistical methodology. Notions such as frequency (i.e. past observation) and probability (i.e. future predictability) tell us that if something happens frequently, then it is significant because of regularity, and therefore future behaviour can be predicted. As Halliday (1991: 33) puts it, “For register variation, (.), probability is the central concern. (.) Register variation can in fact be defined as systematic variation in probabilities; a ‘register’ is a tendency to select certain combinations of meanings with certain frequencies (.)”.6

However, according to McEnery and Wilson (2001: 76), qualitative descriptions are good for identifying delicate variations in the data, whereas quantitative ones are suited to frequent phenomena (vs. rare phenomena). So, as long as qualitative analysis is not considered primarily classificatory, it too can be of use to the researcher. Indeed, a mixture of both qualitative and quantitative methodology applies here to our corpus investigation, as both the distillation of typical and of rare behaviour of a word or phrase is relevant to our purposes. This is in line with the issues raised by Sinclair (1991) of typicality vs. individuality/uniqueness of examples in a corpus: individual examples can be significant as well for register identification.

# 3. Arguing linguistics

But the mass of verbiage from all over the world (.) lead, guide, cajole, persuade, entreat or disgust as well as inform us (.). (WAL)

As stated at the beginning of this paper, the focus is on the argumentative strategies devised by textbook writers in the introductory chapters and the various lexicogrammatical resources deployed to realise such strategies.

In order to map out the lexico-grammar of argumentation, some applications of the Wordsmith Tools suite of programmes, namely the Concordancer, the Wordlist and the Keywords have proven particularly useful. As shown in Scott (2001a), depending on the tool one chooses, one can operate at different levels.

Thus, a first stage of the analysis was concerned with the identification of elements revealing something of the argumentative orientation in the corpus overall, without consideration of stylistic differences across the textbooks, therefore with no comparative aim. This initial stage is a synergy of quantitative and qualitative analyses, in that the items chosen for exploration were derived partly from an initial analysis of the frequency wordlist, and partly from the previous studies that were mentioned at the beginning of this paper.

The next, more properly comparative, stages of the investigation made use of Wordsmith’s Keywords tool. By performing the chi-square test of significance, this tool allows you to measure similarity between corpora. Thus, comparisons were drawn between, first, my small potentially register-specific corpus of introductory chapters to linguistics textbooks and the written component of the British National Corpus (register analysis); then, between each textbook sampled in my corpus and the rest of the corpus, and, finally, between each textbook sampled in my corpus and the written part of BNC (2002) (stylistic analysis).

# 3.1. Presenting the nature of language

Retrieval of occurrences through the Wordlist and the Concordancer with a view to searching for signals of the unfolding of argumentation has given language, the eighth most frequent word in the corpus, as major participant.8 Its occurrence in both modified and nonmodified environments, as the collocational patternings discussed hereafter show, reflects the way in which the opening chapters are generally structured: they start by giving a definition of linguistics as “the scientific/systematic study of language”, or simply “the study of language”. Then, the next move is the explanation of what language is, which is inextricably intertwined with the history of language study with its thorny and still open issues.

Using the Concordancer, two-word clusters from language were obtained, that is, words that are found repeatedly in its company, in order to investigate the collocation patterns of language. We get language functioning as constituent in the post-modification structure of the nominal group, which is labelled Qualifier:9 the first most frequent cluster (with 499 occurrences) is of language, with language being referred to as the mass noun. If, however, we consider its patterning to the right, language is the first most frequent one. Such patterns of language, that is words adjacent to it both to its left and to its right and organised in terms of frequency can be seen in the data given in Table 2: the top word in each column is the word most frequently found in that position up to two words on either side.

Table 2 Patterns of language (2,2 span)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>1</td><td>of</td><td>of</td><td> language</td><td>is</td><td>the</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>the</td><td>the</td><td>language</td><td>and</td><td>a</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>a</td><td>human</td><td> language</td><td>as</td><td>and</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>in</td><td>a</td><td> language</td><td>in</td><td>is</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>use</td><td>in</td><td> language</td><td>the</td><td>to</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>study</td><td>spoken</td><td> language</td><td>to</td><td>it</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>to</td><td>that</td><td> language</td><td>which</td><td>of</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>and</td><td>about</td><td> language</td><td>study</td><td>are</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>that</td><td>written</td><td> language</td><td>but</td><td>be</td></tr></table></body></html>

Since language is found as constituent in the post-modification structure of the nominal group, it is interesting to investigate what the head nouns in which the ofstructure is embedded are. Query as to the four-word clusters from language reveal them and provide us with a telling clue as to the definition of linguistics given as initial and some of the issues addressed in these introductions, like, for example, what the nature and origin of language are (Table 3).

What is the semantics of the preposition of, then? According to Downing and Locke (2002: 466), of can be regarded as “a generalised syntactic marker of various semantic relations between two nominals. The relations are to be interpreted in terms of the type of information the nominal completive gives about the nominal head of the group”. Below are 25 randomly selected concordance lines for the phrase of language. The head-nouns are printed in bold:

From the evidence of these lines, the nature of the head-nouns is abstract. In particular, we can distinguish between those which are nominalizations, where the meaning of the preposition of is objective, namely the study of, the use of, definitions of, accounts of $^ +$ language, etc. In fact, these could be seen as nominalized versions of a potentially more congruent clausal structure of the ‘studying language’ type;10 and those which raise the ‘issues’ about language, and form the basis for the arguments that follow, such as, for example, the genesis of, the origins of the nature of or the complexity of, the forms and functions of $\dot { + }$ language, where of has a subjective meaning.

As far as collocates to the right of language are concerned, it is no surprise to find it collocating with is (Table 2), for it is the participant of which most information is predicated in these introductory chapters. As the object of linguistic enquiry, language is defined, described, modelled, and so on, as can be observed in the 25 concordance lines for the phrase language is selected from the corpus. The lines have been sorted so that the right co-text appears in alphabetical order.

Hall (1968: 158), tells us that language is \*"the institution whereby humans is that, from one perspective, language is a very general and abstract phen of interaction between people, language is a social phenomenon. It enables ) According to Sapir (1921: 8): "Language is a purely human and non-instinct anguage features. To summarize: language is a patterned system of arbitrary y and with minimal effort.

These considerations show that the high frequency of words such as of or is, which have high frequency in the English language in general, seems to be, at least in part, a peculiar feature of this corpus because of the lexico-grammatical patterning that typifies their occurrence. Stubbs (2001b: 58) argues that corpus research shows that even the most frequent words in the language have typical collocates and typical uses. In the case of the Qualifier of-structure, the patterning in question is nominalization, an instance typical of scientific discourse at large and reflecting its reification tendency to transform processes into things (Halliday & Martin, 1993). For want of space, further concordances will not be shown, although others could also be investigated, such as of a language (85 occurrences), with ‘language’ as count noun, and of the language (77 occurrences), with ‘language’ as mass noun. An extended discussion of patterns of is given in Section 4.1.

3.2. Linguistics as dialogue, linguistics as argument

What is language? (Various authors) There are no simple answers to this question (and there are not likely to be any) (WAL) For this reason much of linguistics is a structure of arguments. (BRO)

I have elsewhere shown how textbooks writers, in introducing their readers, whether novices or peers, to the foundational concepts of the discipline, construe a rhetorical, in a sense almost metaphorical, representation of scientific practice in general and linguistics, in particular, as ongoing dialogue within the discoursedisciplinary community, where the polyphony of voices is traceable (Freddi, forthcoming). This holds true of economics textbooks too, and of the introductory chapters within them, in particular, as has been shown in detail by Bondi (1999), who has stressed a dialogic view of textbook writing by pointing out that, with textbooks being an academic genre at the intersection of pedagogic and scientific discourse, enculturation with disciplinary knowledge takes place together with initiation to the enquiry procedures typical of economics through typically dialogic moves.

Linguistics is lexicalised both as ongoing dialogue and argument. There is, indeed, reciprocity between argumentation and dialogue, to the extent that argumentation has got something intrinsically dialectic to it and dialogues can be seen as sequences of argumentative moves.

Various items of the lexico-grammar signalling the dialogue were identified. Among others:

Nominal groups having as head nouns debate, discussion, controversy, dispute, conflict, often occurring in co-referential strings as in example (1) below, and argumentative nouns lexicalising the steps of the reasoning process such as (conflicting) results, hypothesis, thesis:

(1) The earlier debates played an important part in the development of traditional grammar. Late 18th-century discussion (.) helped to prepare the way for a better understanding of the interdependence of language, thought and culture (CRY).

(2) And the origin of language is once again the subject of scholarly debate (LYO).

Notice that in example (2) the representation of linguistics as ‘debate’ combines with an implication of the historical stratification of ideas expressed by the adverbial group ‘once again’.

Verbal groups include say, suggest, claim, argue, show, stress, state, maintain, observe, propose, debate, demonstrate (given in rough frequency order). Some are verba dicendi, or verbal processes, others take on a specific argumentative function in the text. Since it is precisely their reporting-argumentative function that is of interest here, not all forms and co-textual environments in which the processes can be found to occur in the corpus are equally relevant in meaning, so that it is not always easy to tell exactly what their frequency is. After the first automatic retrieval step in which the lemmas were searched for in the corpus, the occurrences were then analysed with a view to identifying the reporting pattern of projection. Such pattern, functioning as mechanism of attribution and, therefore, conferring dialogicity to the writing,11 contributes to the construal of the argumentation. In particular, impersonal attribution proves to be a general tendency, whose typicality shows the argumentative nature of textbook introductions: VERBAL/ARGUMENTATIVE PROCESS $^ +$ PASSIVE $\ " ( + \mathrm { M O D A L } )$ o THAT CLAUSE as in It can be argued, and it usually is argued, that (WID), or in it has been variously maintained, it was extensively debated (with one occurrence only to be found in LYO), and in the numerous occurrences of it has been suggested with that as the most frequent collocate to the right of suggested. Example (3) illustrates this point well:

(3) It has also been suggested that the original sounds of language came from natural cries of emotions, such as pain, anger and joy (YUL).

There are 113 occurrences of said, of which some have this reporting function, e.g. as has been said, it is said that, while some others correspond to more direct interventions of the writer into his/her argument when paraphrasing, clarifying and summarising a concept, y can be said to, or $x$ is said to, or this is not to say that (particularly frequent in LYO). Similarly, projection with be said preceded by a modal (can, could, might, must, need to, ought to) as in something must be said, little need be said, it need only be said that, though impersonal in form, usually introduces the writer’s own argument, as well as construing a high degree of commitment to the reported locution.

Modal (mood) a functioning as attribution markers: these are realized by adverbial groups which inscribe in the writing unspecified participants in the dialogue. Among the most frequent ones, variously, usually, widely, generally, sometimes, often combined with one of the above mentioned processes: it is now generally/widely accepted that (LYO), and the sequence according to $x$ where $\mathbf { X }$ has various lexical realizations such as view, opinion, attitude, and the like as in example (4).

(4) According to this view of language, there will be two major components corresponding to linguistic and communicative competence (BRO).

The voices intervening in the dialogue are sometimes specified, so that we find: Names of academic writers, past and present members of the scientific community, which include Saussure, Chomsky, Bloomfield, Sapir, Halliday and Firth, and the Young Grammarians. However, also traditional grammar with 38 occurrences is a voice that can be heard clearly. This form of specific attribution of ideas is less common than the impersonal attribution discussed above.

As far as the representation of linguistics as argument is concerned, various elements were considered:

Nominal groups having as head noun argument itself, where argument has a reporting function and is used to introduce an Objection. In fact, occurrences of argument do not usually report the writer’s arguments, but someone else’s, those of another scholar, and work as a kind of distancing device in order for the writer to counter-argue, again showing the dialogic nature of these introductory chapters (Freddi, forthcoming). The following example illustrates this last point:

(5) How often do we meet the argument that because such and such a word comes from Greek, Latin, Arabic, or whatever language it might be in the particular instance, the correct meaning of the word must be what it was in the language of origin! The argument is fallacious, because the tacit assumption of an originally true or appropriate correspondence between form and meaning, upon which the argument rests, cannot be substantiated (CRY).

Other projecting nouns include: the nominalized forms of the above mentioned argumentative processes (suggest, claim, argue, show, etc.), again functioning as reporting devices, the claim that, the idea that, the point that, the principle that, the suggestion that, the view that followed by projected clause or projected argumentation, as can be seen in example (6):

(6) .there is nothing especially novel about the idea that human beings are born with a cognitive learning capability (WID).

Connectors, both conjunctive and comment adjuncts including but, of course, however, indeed introducing argumentative moves, typically Concession, i.e. the temporary Agreement with the interlocutor’s Thesis followed by Counter-Claim (Mortara Garavelli, 2002: 267). Admittedly, Concession is a highly productive move in persuasive discourse (Mann & Thompson, 1988; more recently discussed by Azar, 1997). The following is an example of intra-sentential connection with Concession followed by Counter-Claim:

(7) This activity may indeed have been a crucial stage in the development of language, but what it lacks is any ‘manipulative’ element. (YUL)

In order to be able to highlight such argumentative moves, but also those implicit logicosemantic relations,12 whether intra- or inter-sentential, which are not signalled by a connector, one often needs larger chunks of text, which need to be read linearly as a whole, leaving aside concordances and the corpus. This last point is addressed by Sinclair (1991: 5) when he mentions instances which do not easily detach from their context, or which require a very extensive stretch of text to avoid distortion of interpretation. However, this less explicitly signalled aspect of textual development goes beyond the scope of this paper.

It is, after all, no small task to embark on a thorough introduction to linguistics; some books of this kind have four hundred pages or more! (CRY)

The reader has every right to be suspicious. (LYO)

The writer–reader relation and the encapsulation of the reader in the unfolding of argument can be seen in the use of interpersonal pronouns, in particular:

The I/we opposition and the distinction exclusive vs. inclusive we. Various patterns of inclusive we have bee0n identified and are summarised in Table 4. One of the most frequent is if we in CRY, which I have called ‘Hypothetical we’, introducing an illustration of some concept that is the argumentative move of Exemplification.

(8) We respond to other people’s language in terms of our own social background (.). If we are from Liverpool, then Liverpudlian speech sounds more pleasant (.). (CRY)

Another significantly frequent pattern is we followed by a modal verb, introducing Concession, a prelude to a Counter-Claim as in example (9).

(9) We may allow, then, that language is an impressive human achievement. But is it specifically and uniquely human? (WID)

Of course, the fact that we tends to occur in a modal environment (‘Modal we’ in Table 4) does reinforce the interpersonal dimension of these introductory chapters.

More straightforward forms of direct address to the reader have both the form of: Interrogatives and imperatives as found in CRY Why (bother to) study language?, Why do people speak differently?, What is language?

Among imperatives, some introduce the moves of Exemplification and Hypothetical Argument in formulas such as consider for example, or suppose that as in example (10):

(10) Consider, for example, the words marzipan, telephone and dial. (BRO)

Analysis of these explicit signals of the argumentative flow allows us to advance a preliminary hypothesis of ‘a lexico-grammar of argumentation’, which, as has been shown in this section, realizes a representation of linguistics as scientific enterprise of a scientific community and question–answer dialectic; in sum, while the writer–reader interaction unfolds, the novice is acculturated to the argumentative strategies of the discipline by being exposed to the type of scientific questions that are presented as needing to be posed. To quote Hyland (2000: 105), “textbooks, for many students, also provide a model of literacy practices, how the discipline states what it knows”.

# 4. Keywords: register and stylistic analysis

The second, comparative stage of the investigation made use of Wordsmith’s Keywords tool. By performing the chi-square test of significance, this tool allows you to pick out words in a text whose frequency is outstandingly high (and outstandingly low) with respect to a reference corpus, which is considered to represent ‘a norm’ (Scott, 1997: 236, 2001a: 48, 2001b: 109).

# 4.1. Register analysis

This stage was concerned with comparing the whole corpus with the written part of the British National Corpus (BNC) of about 90 million words. By comparing such a small potentially register-specific corpus with a much larger cross-registerial corpus, which is considered a representative sample of written contemporary English,13 one was hoping to find elements, namely keywords, that could account for register specificity. The result of this comparison gave a keywords list with words sorted by their keyness that can be seen in Table 5. The words at the top of the list will be those more typical of the register. The keywords that crop upon top of the list are LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS, LANGUAGES and LINGUISTIC, that is to say, words that have to do with Field of discourse. Scott (2001a: 61) expressly warns us that it is primarily information about the Field that one is likely to retrieve by asking the programme to look for keywords.

My claim here is that this keywords list can be best visualized by a histogram (Fig. 1), which is amenable to the following reading:

The distribution of keywords seems to me to recall the Pareto chart. A clear illustration of this chart is to be found in Montgomery and Runger (1994: 15),

An important variation of a histogram for categorical data is the Pareto chart. This chart is widely used in quality improvement efforts, and the categories usually represent different types of defects or product/process problems. The categories are ordered so that the category with the largest frequency is on the left, followed by the category with the second largest frequency and so forth.

“Pareto Law”; that is, most of the defects can be accounted for by only a few categories.   
(.).

In other words, if we consider the trend of the curve with its dramatic drop and flattening out, we could argue that there are very few words that are outstandingly key, or that are significant for an identification of the register or functional variety under study, particularly those which deal with the subject-matter, namely language and linguistics, also called ‘aboutness-words’ as found in Scott (2001a: 48).

However, one can cut out fewer words and accept the higher number of possible candidates for significance with reference to registerial variation (imagine to shift the bar in Fig. 1). For example, the fifth most keyword in this list is the relational is. Indeed, is is one of the most common word in English (Sinclair, 1999: 176). However, by taking in is for the purposes of identification of register-specificity, one can find out patterns in which is occurs that may prove typical of this register. Incidentally, it should be noted that Ivanic (1998) has shown how relational processes are characteristic of academic discourse at large and correspond to an emphasis on established facts and general truths.

Moreover, when observing the collocational patterning of is, within a span of two words to the right and two to the left, patterns do emerge such as it is $^ +$ Adj. $+ t o$ infinitive, with it is (the most frequent co-occurrence with 766 occurrences of $\Dot { \boldsymbol { u } }$ ) in thematic position introducing an embedded clause as Subject (e.g. It is easy to be smug about language, or, it is difficult to imagine now what research into spoken language could be, etc.), then the existential there (222 occurrences) is and there is no (e.g. There is a clear awareness of word taboos, or, There is no such thing as a primitive human language), also in thematic position, and that (116 occurrences) is introducing a defining relative clause (e.g. speakers nonetheless control a system that is unbounded in scope, or, ignorance of stylistic variation can produce a picture that is oversimplified to the point of distortion). Once again, we can argue together with Stubbs (2001b: 68) that even highly frequent words show collocation preferences that account for register differences.

# 4.2. Keywords continued: stylistic analysis

The third and final stage of the analysis compared each textbook with the rest of the corpus first, and then with the written part of the BNC. The search for outstandingly frequent words, again keywords, identified the peculiarities of each individual writer. At this stage, discussion centres on LYO and AKMA (compared with the rest of the corpus) and on YUL, AIT and RAD (compared with the written part of the BNC), here chosen as case-studies. The table below (Table 6) shows the first 10 keywords in LYO sorted by keyness: notice THAT holding the first rank. When going back to the concordance lines, one can appreciate the widespread use LYO makes of that as projecting device, which demonstrates his argumentative predilection. Patterns like It is now widely/generally accepted that, He does not accept that/He certainly accepts that, often with explicit attribution of a thought, idea or stance, lexicalise the dialogue the writer entertains with the scientific community.

The word TERM, the third ranked keyword, often followed by some technical vocabulary supposedly new to the reader, tells us something of his attention to explaining each label and defining each concept, which could be interpreted either as didactic preoccupation or a sign of the chapters being introductory. The morpheme NON-, also quite on top of the list, belongs to phrases like non-arbitrary, non-discrete, non-language, non-scientific, non-standard (said of languages and dialects) and reflects his teaching style, which proceeds in the argument by antitheses, contrasts and comparisons. Similarly, DISTINCTION occurs in pre-modified phrases such as standard distinction, used to introduce certain dichotomies and features of language.

Table 7 shows the first 11 keywords in AKMA: RULES and GOVERNED certainly reveal something of the generative background of the authors and their cognitive approach to the study of language, indeed language is primarily seen as rule-governed in this textbook. As far as CHAPTER is concerned, its keyness is justified by the description of the contents of the book around which the one introductory chapter in AKMA is built (see, for example, Chapter 2 is concerned with.); on the other hand, FASCINATED, which occupies the second rank of the list, tells us of the authors’ teaching methodology, apparently an attempt to present the disciplinary content by appealing to non-rational components of the learning process, as can be seen in It is apparent that people have been fascinated with language and communication for thousands of years (.). 14

When comparing YUL with the written part of the BNC, the kinds of keywords one obtains are those shown in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 2, the first 25 keywords reflect the specificities of YUL and position him as marginal or peripheral to the set of textbooks chosen as sample. Some other authors are closer to the centre of the set, thus better representing what the standard practice is. Comparison of the various keywords lists helps gain a less monolithic impression of what writers do in the opening chapters by highlighting rhetorical and ideological differences. In fact, the keywords lists are quite different one from the other. It will suffice here to compare YUL with RAD and AIT. As can be seen in Fig. 2 and in the histograms that follow, while YUL introduces the study of language in terms of the animal/human opposition, enacting a behaviouristic, and possibly positivistic ideology, AIT represents the unmarked way, as it were, of introducing the readers to linguistics, reflecting the general tendency mentioned at the beginning of this paper: Fig. 3 shows that the four most keywords are LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS, LINGUISTS and LANGUAGES. Indeed, that the focus of YUL textbook is language is anticipated in the very title of his book, which reads The study of language rather than the more common Introduction to linguistics; in particular, in the introductory chapters he sets off by posing the distinction between human and animal language and reports many of the experiments made on chimpanzees to elicit these differences.

On the other hand, RAD reveals its cognitive approach and affiliation to a formalist school of thought: notice BRAIN, COGNITIVE, FACULTY, SENTENCE and SENTENCES quite on top of the list (Fig. 4).

In sum, the main criticism expressed by some researchers (Kilgarriff, 1996; Stubbs, 1995) of the use of the chi-test for identifying keywords can, in my opinion, be removed by suggesting considering the Pareto law, which, however, heuristic, is nonetheless a valid way for analysing many aspects of human reality, as shown by Montgomery and Runger (1994) quoted above, and which is by no means less reliable than any other statistical test for identifying words which are the most typical of a text or register under study.15

# 5. Discussion and conclusions

The analysis carried out raises discussion on two interrelated issues: (i) computer-assisted corpus analysis using Wordsmith Tools, and (ii) small corpora and the study of register variation.

As far as the first issue is concerned, each stage in the analysis assisted by Wordsmith requires integrating the vertical reading of the corpus with constant going back to the actual text and linear, horizontal reading of it. Of course, this is something known to both theorists and practitioners of corpus linguistics as stressed in Tognini-Bonelli (2001). However, it seems to me to apply all the more to an investigation of ways of arguing and to the EAP pedagogic potential of the notion of a ‘lexico-grammar of argumentation’, as shown in the section on the logico-semantic relations between clauses and/or sentences realizing argumentative moves such as Concession, Exemplification, Counter-Claim, and so on. A similar point has been made by Flowerdew (1998), who says that specialised corpora need to be exploited at a mote textlinguistic level if they are to develop further their pedagogical applications.

Moreover, the comparisons drawn with the Keywords application allow for further considerations: first, there seems to be little deviation from the norm in terms of frequency of occurrences when comparing our corpus with the written part of the BNC. Second, the only significant deviation, which, in mathematical terms, could be seen as exhibiting the Pareto Law and thus taking place when the derivative of the curve connecting the keyness values is different from zero, concerns the frequency of LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS, LANGUAGES and LINGUISTIC, that is, words that belong to the Field of the register under study, namely introductory chapters to linguistics textbooks. Therefore, the register thus far can be identified by virtue of its Field. However, because of their probabilistic nature, these data lend themselves to two possible interpretations:

![](img/a9a1295307a4043c22c191829d1b9864737791ba3b2785386c6cbc710320df56.jpg)

Fig. 4. First 25 keywords rad.lst\written BNC.lst.

1. If there is no significant deviation from the written English language represented by the 90 million words of the written BNC, except for those aboutness-words identified above, then our corpus proves to be in a way a representative sample of written contemporary English, for arguably two reasons I can see: its size (about 161,000 words), however, hard to believe this is, may be large enough; and the register, or functional variety itself. In other words, since these are only the introductory chapters to the textbooks, in which the novice reader is introduced to the discipline, the terms adopted are very likely to be very general ones, that is to say very frequent in the language in general. This may turn out not to be the case in the actual body of the textbooks. Or, one could argue, for the very fact that linguistics is an eminently humane science, the language it uses to talk about language is representative of the English language in general. On the basis of this last point, it might not be worth teaching ESP and EAP courses in ‘English for Linguistics’ as it were, differently from what has been shown for the hard sciences (Hyland, 1999, 2000; Parkinson, 2000), for example, or for Economics (Bondi, 1999), Politics and Law (Bayley & Miller, 1993), or even Literature16 (Miller, 1998).

2. Alternatively, one can choose to accept a higher risk of error in the hypothesis that there are significant keywords and include words that have high frequency in both a small specialized corpus and a general corpus (of, is, we). It will be the patterns in which they might occur, their typical collocates and typical uses, which may reveal something of the register-specific usage like those of we, is and of adumbrated above.17 Conclusions can only be probabilistic, for the very nature of language is inherently so.

Furthermore, when comparing each individual textbook writer in the corpus with the others, then keywords crop upon top of the list which reflect ideological and stylistic peculiarities of the various writers. Some of these author-specific keywords also emerge when the comparison is made between a single writer and the more or less 90 million words of written BNC. These words pertain not only to the ideational, but also to the interpersonal and the textual levels, thus they give information not just as to the Field, but also as to the Tenor and the Mode of discourse, and ultimately reveal something of the disciplinary vision, the ideological stance of the writers, their academic positioning, and more of their personalities, as well as their way of teaching and arguing linguistics, that is of their rhetoric.

In sum, while statistical analysis proves helpful in picking out differences that would otherwise be overlooked by a human rather than computer-assisted reading of linguistics textbooks, it appears possible to advance the hypothesis that the frequency of occurrence of particular constructions accounts for differences of style more than of register: there indeed are registerial variations, namely those having to do with the patterning of the most common words (e.g. it isCAdj. $+ t o$ infinitive, etc.), but there are also stronger inter-author ones.
