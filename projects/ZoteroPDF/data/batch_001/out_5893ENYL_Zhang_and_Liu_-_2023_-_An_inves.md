# ABSTRACT

Chinese higher education internationalization demands effective English for Academic Purposes (EAP) writing support to help Chinese college students engage in academic study and scholarly exchange. Writing centers, a globally prevailing form of U.S.-rooted writing support, have become a promising approach to innovating College English instruction in China. Recognizing the lack of empirical research on writing centers as part of EAP instruction, this study examines the missions and practices of glocal writing centers in China, i.e., indigenous writing centers with Chinese characteristics, by conducting photo elicitation-facilitated, in-depth interviews with writing center directors/founders from eleven Chinese universities. This study reveals two types of Chinese glocal writing centers, namely English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) writing centers and English for Academic Purposes-English for General Purposes (EAP-EGP) hybrid writing centers, which are guided by indigenous missions of serving as innovation sites for the EGP-EAP/ESP reform of College English and responding to Chinese higher education internationalization. Additionally, Chinese writing centers distinguish themselves through a range of key practices, for example, the overwhelming preference for faculty tutors, acceptance of proofreading, and expanded writing activities. Implications are offered for implementing and researching writing centers as a glocal practice of EAP writing support in China and beyond.

# 1. Introduction

With English as the current academic lingua franca, Chinese higher education internationalization demands that Chinese universities provide students with effective EAP support, especially in cultivating globally competitive talent wit strong English writing abilities to engage in academic study and scholarly exchange (e., Cai, 2013, 2020; Shu, 2020; Wen, 2014). Writing centers, a globally prevailing form of U.S-rooted writing support, are "ideal hubs to implement systematic EAP interventions that might produce impact on a larger scale (Gustafsson & Ganobcsik-Wiliams, 2016, p. 525), thereby holding significant potential in benefiting Chinese students' English writerly development as future global citizens.

The expansion of writing centers to over 66 countries worldwide (Tiruchittampalam et al., 2018) has rendered writing centers ade facto global ractice with myriadsof indigenous features (Barnawi, 2018; Lee, 2014; Tan et al, 2017). In English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts such as Saudi Arabia and Japan, writing centers are conceived both as a result of internationalization (Eusafzai, 2018) and a means to promote intenationalization (Okuda, 2020). Likewise, Chinese universities have become interested in \*adopting] the way of American writing centers to helpstudents with their English writing" since the 1990 (Fang, 2020, para. 2). Based on data from five annual conferences on Chinese writing centers since 2017 and our extensive search on Chinese university wesites, over thirty universities in China's Mainland have established English writing centers, with an increasing number of universities planning to create their own centers (Chen & Wang, 2022).In China, writing centers are considered apromising way to nnovate English writing instruction (Zhang, 2021), as Fang (2020) predicts: the "EWC [English writing center] in Chinese universities will become a very important part in [the] reform of [C]ollege English teaching because of its effctiveness in broadening [the] vision of writing, improving communication skils and making its contribution to globalization' (para. 8). Nevertheles, scant empirical research has investigated writing center practices in China, and there is in particular a lack of inquiry into writing centers as part of EAP support against the backdrop of Chinese higher education internationalization.

To begin to address this gap, we carried out a cross-institutional study to examine the indigenous missions and practies of Chinese writing centers by conducting photo elicitation-facilitated, in-depth interviews with eleven Chinese university writing center directors/founders. With Contact Zone as a conceptual framework (Pratt 1991), this study provides insights into how Chinese practi. tioners strategicall adapt North American writing center praxis in the Chinese context, ffering implications for implementing and researching writing centers as a glocal practice of EAP writing support in China and beyond.

# 2. Literature review

This section begins with a discussion of College English reform in China to provide the context where Chinese writing centers are developing; then, we review litrature on North American writing center philosophy and indigenous writing center practices across the globe, followed by an introduction to our conceptual framework of Contact Zone.

# 2.1. College English reform: an EGP vs. EAP/ESP debate

College English, which is instructed to the broad university population of non-English-major students at Chinese universities and colleges, has traditionally met difficulties such as oversized classes, a rigid exam-focused orientation, and the lack of alegitimate disciplinary status (e.g., Cai, 2013; Fu & Matoush, 2012). Today, Chinese higher education internationalization demands College English programs to reform their instruction, because the traditional skill-based Englishfor General Purposes (EGP) approach-an English Language Teaching (ELT) approach that aims to cultivate students' interest and habits in learning English .. to enhance students' general language competence for a more accurate and fluent production and reception of English in dealing with everyday situations' (iu et al., 2011, p. 271)has flen short of China's preing need for cultivating gloall comptitie tlent (Cai, 2020). As such, the critical \*reform or perish' situation (Cai, 2013) has sparked a heated EGP vs. EAP/ESP debate among Collge English programs (Wen, 2014), with some proposing entirely replacing the EGP approach with an EAP/ESP approach (Cai, 2013, 2020) and others caling for an EGP-EAP/ESP hybrid approach for more holistic and balanced English education (e.g., Shu, 2020; Wen, 2014) both highlighting EAP/ESP's advantages in serving Chinese students' increasing nees for utilizing English to conduct disciplinary study and engage in international academic and professional exchange.

As a burgeoning field within EAP, English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP), which \*addresses] the concerns of profes sional researchers and post-graduate students who need to publish i peer-reviewed intenational journals Cargill & Burgess, 2008, p. 75), deserves special attention in the aforementioned Collge English reform in China. Despite the exponential growth of ERP research, ERPP pedagogy remains under-researched (Habibie & Starfield, 2022). Currntly, besides ERPP courses/programs and thesis/disertation mentorship, ERP instruction is provided mainly by writing centers, language centers, and student support centers (Flowerdew & Habibie, 2021, p. 116) however, due to their undergraduate centrism, the short-term nature of their services, and the lack of ERPP experts, the ERPP support provided by writing centers is highly limited in scope and variety (Flowerdew & Habibie, 2021). The lack of research into the role of writing centers in ERPP pedagogy is particularly true of the Chinese context. Therefore, research efforts should be invested in exploring the missions and practices of writing centers in China, especially with an eye to the EAP/ESP-EGP debate regarding College English reform and ERPP instruction.

# 2.2. North American writing center philosophy and approaches

Historicall, the underlying North American writing center philosophy is considered to be: \*to produce beter writers, not better writing (North, 1984,p. 438), along with signature features such as nondirective tutoring, global isues prioritized over local issues, and policies on no proofreading (rffe, 1984; Harris, 1985; Shamoon & Burns, 1995). Meanwhile the writing center community has constantly reexamined and inovated the traditional writing center philosophy, especiall in response to multilingual writers unique neds (e rri  ia, 193; Rfth, 2015) ch s seeki ways  oh mro the qualit f st texts (i, betr writing) and cultivating ther long-term writerl rowth (i.., beter writers) (Kim, 2014) relacing the directive/nondirctive dichotomy with a continuum and promoting flexibility during tutorials (e.g., Carino, 2003; Williams, 2005; Wingate, 2019); respecting writers need for language aistance (Williams & Severino, 2004). Hence, due to writing center practitioners' and scholars' unceasing efforts to diversify tutoring philoophy and approaches (Gellr et al., 2007), North American writing center philosophy remains dynamic and responsive to new and local contexts and student profiles rather than a monolithic, rigid construct.

# 2.3. Indigenous writing center practices across the globe

As writing centers spread worldwide, the traditional North American writing center philosophy tends to exert important impact on writing centers across the globe. The tendency to view a student-centered, nondirectie, proces-based peer tutoring approach as classic fatures of U.S. writing centers has appeared frequently in litrature on international writing centers, such as Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia (e.g, Mack, 2014; Tan et al, 2017; Turner, 206), and particularly in Chinese writing center-related publications (e.g., Chen & Wang, 2022; He, 2018, 2021; Li, 2017; Zhang & Hughes, 2022). Hence, despite the highly dynamic nature of writing center philophy, a so-calle traditional North American writing center model seems to be widely acknowledged by international writing centers.

Meanwhile, writing centers outside of North America often adapt the writing center concept to their own context, resulting in various indigenous practices in terms of tutors, tutoring styl, and service range, which keeps diversifying and invigorating writing center praxis (e.g., Barnawi, 2018; Lee, 2014; Tan et al., 2017). Unlike the prevalence of peer tutors at U.S. writing centers, some writing centers in contexts such as the U.K., Middle East, Japan, and South Korea tend to prefer faculty and professional tutors (e., Barnawi, 2018; McKinley, 2010; Nathan, 2021; Turner, 2006) and hold reservations about peer tutoring (see Kunde et al., 2015 for an example of India). Regarding tutoring style, many writing centers adopt more directive tutoring approaches than their U.S. counterparts. For instance, due to students' familirity with teacher-centered, hierarchical learning, their perception of tutors as experts rather than peers, and their lack of ability to selfidentify writing problems, it may be seen as challenging to implement student-centered, nondirective tutoring in locales such as Germany, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan eg., Bonazza, 2016; hang, 2013; Lee, 2015; Mack, 2014). The fous and form of writin-relaed events also reflect writing cnters eforts in innoatio, such as offering course- and exam-related writing workshops in a United Arab Emirates writing center (Barnawi, 2018) and hosting creative writing events in a Polish writing center (Reichelt et al., 2013).

In China, writing centers were imported by Chinese scholars with experience visiting and using writing centers in English-speaking countries such as the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. (Fang, 2020; Song, 2018). While Chinese universities have become increasingly interested in establishing writing centers (e.g., Zhang, 2019; Li, 2017), ittleis known about how writig centers have been implemented in China. Chinese writing center scholarship mostly reviews Western writing center philosophy and models (e.g., He, 2021; Zhang & Hughes, 2022), and research almost entirely focuses on individual cases of Chinese writing centers and examines one-to-one tutoring (e.g., Zhang, 2019; Chen & Wang, 2022; He, 2018; Li, 2017). Hence, extant literature only offers a glimpse into the deel. opment of writing centers in China, and virtually no crossintitutional studies have systematically investigated how writing centers can be factored into College English reform in Chinese higher education internationalization through an administrative lens.

In sum, the diverse indigenous practices of wrting centrs acrosthe globle llustrat that writing centers are flexible, dynamic, and highly context-deendent. In the ra f higher education internationalization, writing centers aregocat they are a global practice of writing support that travelsacross the globe and, when they reach new destinations, their encounter with unique local conditions can generate limitless possibilities of indigenization in what Pratt (1991) describes as contact zones.

# 2.4.Writing centers as contact zones

Pratt's (1991) metaphor of contact zone, i., \*social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other (p. 34), has been adopted to conceptualize writing centers: for instance, Papay (2002) regards writing centers in South Africaboth as a comfort zone that provides rapport, support, and guidance, and as a contact zone that welcomes and confronts cultural differences. Particularly, Eusafza's (2018) genealogical study of writing centers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KA) offers a well-constructed model of writing center indigenization with contact zone as a key construct. As Fig. 1 shows, Eusafzai (2018) advocates de-Americanizing writing centers through a process of Saudification by creating a contact zone where the imported model of writing center meets, clashes, and grapples with local elements, such as \*local exigencies, Saudi users writing needs, local students and tutors attitude, the available local expertise, and the overall milieu of Saudi higher education institutions (p. 16). Eusafzai (2018) argues that only through indigenization can the North American writing center concet be efectively merged into Saudi higher ducation institutions.

We adopt Pratt's (1991) contact zone metaphor and Eusafzai's (2018) indigenization model as our conceptual framework and regard each Chinese writing center as a potential contact zone where the imported North American writing center philosophy meets clashes, and grapples with Chinese local elements especially College English reform and Chinese higher education internationalzation. Here, we focus on transculation, a phenomenon f contact zones, which Prat (191) defines as \*rocesses whereby members of subordinated or marginal groups select and invent from materials transmitted by a dominant or metropolitan culture (p. 36). Inthis study, we examine Chinese writing center professionals selective adoption and indigenous invention of North American writing center philosophy through transculturation processes in contact zones.

Specifically, we investigate writing center glocalization in China on two levels: first, because individual writing centers are usually guided by a misson statement, we study Chinese writing centers' indigenous missions through the voice of their directors/founders; second, we investigate how North American writing center philosophy is transcultured in China by eliciting Chinese writing center directors/founders' discussions of their centers indigenous practices. With the notion of contact zone, our study is guided by the following research questions:

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Research participants and contexts

This cross-institutional study was conducted to investigate the articulated missions and indigenous practices of eleven selected Chinese universty writing centers by implementing photo elicitation-facilitated, in-depth interviews with writing center directors/ founders. Eleven Chinese writing center directors/founders were invited to participate in this study because of their managerial role in the establishment and development of writing centers. With a convenience sampling method (Etikan et al, 2016), we identified and reached potential participants in three ways: 1) conference programs containing lists of Chinese writing center professonals who attended the annual Chinese writing center conferences between 2017 and 2021; 2) social media (WeChat) group chats of Chinese writing center professionals; and 3) personal networks. We gained informed consent from eleven directors/founders, who represent a range of hine universty writing cnters housd in vrios typs of inttions (e Table 1). Specifically, five participans obtained their highest degee from the U.S./U.K., and the others had experience s vsting scholarsto North Americathe U.K., and Australia all the participants had knowledge about Western writing center praxis with varying degrees. Various forms of English writing support were provided at their instittions such as EAP writing courses, writing workshops, and editing service iscounts offered by publishers; however, writing center seems to be the only service that offrs individualized writig support. In addition, all the investigated universities are in China's Mainland, and they mainly offr courses with Chinese as a Medium of Instruction, with only a small portion of English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) courses.

# 3.2. Data collection

Data was collcted through in-depth interviews with photo elicitation techniques. First, we obtained informed consent from each participant, who was clearly informed of the purposes and procedures of this study, the potential risks and benefits they might receive, and the withdrawal policy with a formal consent form. Next, we sent them image guidelines that instructed them to produceat eas ix representative and meaningful images (e.g., photos, screnshots) of their writing center in terms of space, marketing, tutoring, administration, special events, and research. These images were intended as interview stimuli because, as Harper (2002) suggests, \*photo elicitation mines deeper shafts into different part of human consciousnes than do words-alone interviews" (pp. 22-23). Then, semi-structured interviews were held via Tencent Meeting, a video conferencing software, due to the travel inconvenience caused by Covid-19. During interviews, we asked the participants questions regarding their background, beliefs, and experience of writing center work (see interview protocol in Appendix A). Participants were also asked to elaborate on their writing center missions and practices by describing their self-selected images. The interviews were recorded, which resulted in $^ { 1 8 . 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ of interview data and 87 images; supportive documents discussed during the interviews, such as writing center mission statements, marketing material, and training manuals, were also collected.

# 3.3. Data analysis

Eleven interview recordings were transcribed with flyrec.com, an online automated transcribing service, and then edited manually by the two researchers and a research asstant (an English-major graduate student). Drawing on Saldana (2009), we conducted open thematic analysis of interview discourse in NVivo 12 Plus; during the coding process we referred to material offred by participants (e.g, photos, screenshots, documents, PowerPoint slides, and WeChat publicaccount) s support for identified salient themes. After reading the transcripts iteratively, we each coded three transcripts (roughly $3 0 \%$ of our data) and generated initial codes and categories, which we then disussed and refined collaboratively. Next the frs athor proceedd with the exploratory codes and categories and coded all the transcripts. uring this proces, similar codes and categories were combined to develop themes that best capturethe participants accounts of their writing center missons and practices (see Appendix B for codebook and code istribution). The themes were shared with all the participants for member checking and revised acordingly to enhance trustworthines.

# 4. Results

In this section, we report our findings regarding the articulated missions and indigenous practices of eleven Chinese writing centers based on interview data and supportive materials. The missions of two types of glocal writing centers in China, including ERPP writing centers and EAP-EGP hybrid writing centers, are presented, followed by a discussion of the indigenous practices of these writig centers.

# 4.1. Missions of Chinese writing centers

Two types of writing centers with different missions were revealed in our data, including aspecialized ERPP approach dedicated to increasing academic publications and a hybrid approach that combines EAP and EGP writing support to ffer need-driven, holistic, diverse writing support In addition, two other salient themes emerged from our participants' discussion of their writing center missions, which highlight ERPP and EAP-EGP hybrid writing centers' roles as innovation sites for College English reform in China and their contribution to their university's internationalization agenda. Next, we present four themes related to Chinese writing center missions with interview data and supportive materials as evidence.

# 4.1.1. An ERPP approach: increasing academic publications

Five writing centers in our study can be categorized as ERPP writing centers with astrong commitment to increasing students' and faculty's academic publications; they offer specialized, product-oriented support geared toward academic English writing for publcation, espciall in high profile intenational journals. Allfive ERP writing center directors mentioned their center's goal to increase publications, reflecting an unambiguous focus on producing more \*publishable" writing. This s evidenced by the wc-11 director's discussion of their enter's mission of helping writers improve the quality of their work: \*e hel tackle both h linguisti and rhetoricdl problems that students and faculy encounter when writing in English to publis in intnationl jouls and for intenational preentations" similarly, the wc-4 director articulated their center's ERPp mission: "Our universt has ut forward the goal of building itelf as a worldclass universit .. Our writing center aims to support our students in acheving world-clss intenationl publications and engaging in worldclass global exchanges." Interestingly, ERPP writing centers' product-oriented focus is meanwhile accompanied by a proces-based expectation that aims to also cultivate \*better writers" with improved academic writing competence. For example, wc-9's missin statement (Fig.2) demonstrated their goal of helping ery student to become an excellnt, indeendent writer" (see portion in the box)

Specificall, ERPP writing support was provided i various forms across the five writing centers. WC-4 helps students improve their papers for publication in international journals and conference presentations and offers language assistance for their application materials for international competitions. WC-6 runs annual ERPP summer camps that help graduate students revise, edit, and finetune" their manuscripts over two or three weeks, while wc-11 helps students polish their conference presentations and papers that have bee accepted with revisions. WC-8 provides ERPP workshops, expert sharing, and one-on-one tutorials to support students and faculty with international publishing needs. Additionally, the WC-9 director summarized their ERPP support as a $^ { \ast } 4 + \imath$ model," which consists of "one-n-oneorils ifotion liteac lctes, AP workshops, fac-to-face icussons wth joual itrsplus an anul EAP writing symposium for graduate students."

In short, boosting academic publications serves as an achievement index for ERPP writing centers, which execute their specialized ERPP mission in various forms. A strong product-based orientation stands out in such ERPP writing support, accompanied by a long term goal to cultivate better writers.

4.1.2. A hybrid approach: need-driven, holistic, diverse writing support

Six writing centers are identified with their multifaceted missions and eclectic services that cover both EAP and EGP writing support, so we name them as EAP-EGP hybrid writing centers. These six hybrid writing centers strive to sponsor students' holistic writerl development by addresing their diverse needs for English writing support The missions that participants dscussed, such as "romotelife-long learnngf writig" (c-1), "crte a culture of Englishwriting" (wc-7), and "arnessth potntil of ach student writer" (WC-10), align with an EGP aroach by claiming to support Chinese students' comprehensive development as English writers.

On the other hand, hybrid writing centers also offer multidimensional EAP writing support driven by students needs. After surveying students most needed writing support, WC-2, WC-5, wC-7, and wc-10 provide tutorials and workshops fr course-related EAP writing and high stakes, exam-related writing, for example, IELTS writing, College English Test (Band 4 and Band 6) writing. Meanwhile, as the directors of WC-1 and WC-2 mentioned,although they did not specialize in ERPP writing, hybrid writing centers also offer a small amount of publication-related support per students' request. In addition, hybrid writing centers often function with multifaceted goal. For example, as the following quote shows, the W-5 director discussed their center's three-fold mission, including serving students, informing teaching, and creating research opportunities:

Adhering to the philoophy and mission of "equal collaboration,serving students,serving teaching, and serving research," the Writing Center aims to build itelf as an open comfort zone for writers, a place for obtaining writing resources, a base for writing teaching research, and a space for communication and idea exchange.

Similarly, the wc-2 director also shared their multifaceted goals of offering tutorial support, providing feedback to improve classroom teaching, and serving as asource for writing research. In short, hybrid writing centers aim to construct acomprehensive ecology of writing support and achieve multifaceted goals marked with EAP and EGP orientations.

# 1.1.3. Writing centers as innovation sites for College English reform

Nine writing centers -both ERPP and hybrid ones--were established as an exploratory endeavor to inovate and even rescue their university's struggling College English program. One telling quote from the director of wc-4, an ERPP writing center, suggests that their center was created as an important alternative source of EAP writing support:

When we worked on our five-year and 15-year plans, I realized a problem with College English instruction: this program has been shrinking. The university cut our instruction hours from over 200 o around 100, which is not just us but a national phenomenon .. So as we work to become a world-clas university, how do foreign language teachers fit in? To some degre, writing centers can be away out for College English, like a backup plan. Even if our credit hours got cut altogether one day, we might sill have a successful academic writing center so that our English instructors could come and work at the writing center.

The goal to change the marginal institutional status of Collge English also manifested as an interdisciplinary orientation shared by ERPP and hybrid writing centers, which collaborate with strong discipline a their universitie by ffering EAP writing support C-4 collaborates with computer science and electricity departments; wC-6 works closely with a range of science departments, such as ngineering, asronautics, physic, etc. Similarly, wc-3 plans to offr iscipline-specific writing assistance to their engineering, science, and liberal arts departments in the long run.

Additionally, some directors suggested that writing centers have the potential to bring vitality to their struggling Collge English programs by offering individualized writing support that had been long missing in traditional kill-based EGP classrooms. For instance, the wc-1 director, who has rich experience reforming the graduate-level Collge English program at a top university over the past seventeen years, noted that the writing center is an innovative efort to "offr individualized English writing support for doctoral and master's students," which was badly needed by students yet not provided by the big-size clases"-an outstanding problem demanding urgent attention that was also articulated by the directors of Wc-4 and wc-6. Likewise, the wc-3 director highlighted the writing center's value  refming the tradtional skill-ae G clasroom: rrenly to lite time is insted in rding and witing clsse. Many underduate students leaned nothing but exam-writing templates. However, the speilized, individualized writing instruction ffered by the witing center c chnge this siio nd el stds move ond skll-ased ieion. In shot, writing crs aligment of their mission with the university's macro-level educational goals of reforming College English is as the wc-3 director described, " strategic move that can well embed the writing center within the university's overall delopment plan, which makes it asier to reive more power and support" in Chinese higher education, where writing centers are yet to gain recognition.

4.1.4. Writing centers serving Chinese higher education internationalization

All eleven writing centers aim to serve their university's internationalization agenda. Notably, eight writing center directors discussion of their mission reflected this dedication, such as helping students and faculty with intenational publication and academic exchange to aid their institution's internationalization goals (WCs-1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11). Furthermore, as shown in Table 2, such internationalization policy was actualized in various practices and achievements across ten writing centers:

To summarize, the eleven writing centers in our study demonstrated two glocal approaches to implementing writing centers in China, i.e, an ERPP approach that strives to boost publication numbers and an EAP-EGP hybrid approach that aims at need-driven, holistic diverse writing support. Both ERPP and hybrid writing centers serve as innovation site for Collge English reform and contribute to Chinese higher education internationalization.

# 4.2. Practices of Chinese writing centers

Like their missions, the practices of Chinese writing centers also demonstrate context-specific and indigenous features. In ths section, we discus indigenous practices of Chinese writing centers in terms of tutors, tutoring style, and services offered.

4.2.1. Tutors: preference for faculty tutoring and concerns about peer tutoring

What quickly tod out from our data was the common use of faculty tutors and the prevailing concerns about peer tutor at Chinese writing center. Overal, 9 out of 11 witing cnters recruit faculty tutor only one center egages both faculty and student per tuors and one center adopts peer tutoring only.

ERPP writing centers' product-oriented goal to increase high-quality publications makes i natural for faculty to be preferred due to their expertise in English language and disciplinary knowledge. Faculty tutors fromWCs-6,8, 9, and 11 consist of both professors from the English department and professors acrosdisciplines, ften those with international publishing experience. For example, faculty tutors from wc-9 come from disciplines suchas English, mathematics, photology, and communication engineering. wc-8 often invites faculty from various disciplines to give lectures and workshops on international publishing, utlizing in-house faculty expertise.

Similarly, hybrid writing centers mostly recruit English instructors as tutors from the Department of Foreign Languages, mainly providing linguistic and rhetorical support. For a few writing centers housed in universties with specialized disciplines, they also engage faculty from other departments to enrich their repertoire of tutor expertise. For instance, wc-2 fers writig tutorials led by faculty from political science and law, while wc-10's faculty tutors come from disciplines such as English, news and communication, and business.

ERPP and hybrid writing center directors/founders almost all expressed concerns about adopting the per tutoring model in China. For example, the WC-6 director stated that he "lacks confidence instudents' ability and experience in tutoring English writing for publcation," which was echoed by the founder of Wc-10, who maintained, based on her experience, that even graduate students are unfit to work as peer tutors because of their lack of expertise and English competency."

One exception to the faculty tutor-only approach was wC-7, a hybrid writing center established in 2014 and closed in 2018 due to financial pressure as well as the resignation of the director. This was the only writing center in our study that used student peer tutors alone. The wc-7 director pointed out that they adopted per tutoring for several reasons, including the strong influence of North American writing center praxis, the cost-effective nature of peer tutoring, and their goal of providing student tutors with professional development. Another exception was WC-8, an ERPP writing center that provides both faculty-led expert \*clinic" consultations and student-led eer tutorials; however, it is worth noting that wc-8 recruits graduate, mostly doctoral, tutors rather than underraduate tutors to secure greater academic writing experience and expertise.

4.2.2. Tutoring style: mixed tutoring styles and marked acceptance of proofreading

Chinese writing centers tend to develop their own tutoring style mixed with directive and nondirective tutoring and hold an open attitude toward ofering proofreading support, whichis considered as ataboo for many North American writing centers. To begin with almost none of the inestigated writig centers insists on a nondirective tutoring approach; instead, multiple participants highlighted a strong need to mix directivetutoring with nondirectiveutoring techniques. Our data showed that ERP tutors, such as thedirectors of WCs-1, 4,and 6, valued nondirective tutoring as a means of respecting writers' ownership and promoting writer engagement. For example, the director of WC-4 highlighted nondirective "negotiation" as their main tutoring approach for ERPP writing: Tutors might identify ple for rovmen nd ask tents how they ike to reise, mabe th soe ti and cles t we woulnt us tl the how to change it or make the changes for them."

Similarly, hybrid writing centers also prefer a mixed tutoring style. For example, the founder of wc-10, a hybrid writing center, discussed her tutoring style and highlighted a mismatch between the American dialogic method and Chinese students' need for directive tutoring:

I would inspire students to think by having a dialogue with them, to communicate with them, and to guide them to find solutions themselves. But besides drawing on the American way, we would need to make some adjustment, because sometimes Chinese students hope to receive advice and instruction from us, so you'd need to be firmer with your instruction and offer them suggestions.

The director of WC-5, a hybrid writing center, further expounded the value of directive instruction for Chinese students and proposed an ongoing diagnostic strategy:

I realized that sometimes students want the tutor to be more directive. You can't just keep asking them questions. Sometimes you need totell them directly, especially when they sem confuse. As tutors, we need to keep assessing students uptake, understanding, and acceptance, and then adjust our tutoring strategies accordingly.

On the other hand, proofreading, a deep-rooted taboo originating from the North American writing center's longstanding fight against being regarded as a fix-it shop (North, 1984), has been met with much more leniency and even embraced by Chinese ERPP writing centers, which is related to ERPP centers product-oriented goal of increasing publications. For instance, the directors of WC-6 and wc-11 shared that their centers offr line-by-line editing geared toward improving the publishing prospects of students' papers. wC-4 director also stated firmly that they were glad to offer proofreading support because this kind of language polishing would not

entail any unethical conduct such as ghostwriting.

4.2.3. Expanded services: a diverse network of academic writing support

Besides classc writing center activities such as one-to-one tutoring and writing workshops, Chinese writing centers also engage in various writing-related events, such as writing contests and academic symposiums. Some writing centers host writing contests tospark students' interest in academic writing. For example, the director of WC-5, a hybrid writing center, shared her strategy of " (y! sai ci xie, to promote writing with writing contests), e.g, after participating in a resume workshop run by the writing center, students submitted their resume to a follow-up resume contest, and winners were awarded prizes (see Fig. 3).

Similarly, the directors f WCs-2, 6, and 9 discussed their expanded range of activities, uch as WC-2's mini EAP writing lectures on their WeChat public account (see Fig. 4), multiple writing contests, and an annual academic symposium.

WC-6 runs ERPP workshops to offer customized writing support to departments where graduate students and faculty seek to achieve international publication (see Fig. 5), and such support was wel recognized by one f the served departments at their annual meeting (see Fig. 6).

Likewise, wc-9 provides a rich service range with a $^ { * } 4 + 1$ model" (see 4.1.1). The expanded service range demonstrates Chinese writing centers'efforts to create a diverse network of academic writing support with multiple points of access.

To summarize, based on interviews with eleven Chinese writing center professionals and the supportive materials that they offered it can be seen that the glocal writing centers in China tend to demonstrate indigenous missions and practices that are substantially different from their North American counterparts. Next, we discuss our findings and ofr research-informed implications.

# 5. Discussion and conclusions

With the increasing impact of higher education internationalization, English writing support is pertinent to every universty that hopes to cultivate talent with global competitiveness, highlighting the vast potential of writing centers -an expanding global writing pedagogy (Okuda, 2017). With unique accounts of directors/founders, our crossinstitutional study examined eleven Chinese writing centers and sketched various indigenous missions and practices highlighting ERPP and hybrid as two prominent approaches to innovating English writing support in the Chinese higher education landscape. Table 3 summarizes our key findings:

Next, we discuss our findings with a model-in-progress (Fig. 7), which is grounded in our data and informed by Pratt's (1991) contact zone metaphor and Eusafzai's (2018) indigenization model.

As Fig. 7 shows, our study revealed that after meeting, clashing, and grappling with the Chinese local conditions, the North American writing center concept went through a transculturation/glocalization proces and resulted in ERPP and EAP-EGP hybrid writing centers, with missions that strategicall align with local exigencies, including aiding College English reform and promoting Chinese higher education internationalization. The Chinese glocal writing centers tend to balance two needs in College English reform against the backdrop of higher education internationalization: the national demand for cultivating talent with strong English writing abilitie (e.g, long-term writrly development) versus intitutions' and individuals' productoriented need for academic writing support (e.g., more publishable papers), with the latter demanding what Luo and Hyland (2016) refer to as "direct textual interventions. In this sense, the indigenous missions of Chinese writing centers echo the highly context-specific nature of EFL writing centers documented in the literature (e.g., Banawi, 2018; Le, 2014; Song, 2018; Tan et al., 2017) and this emphasis on gloalization, i.e., the didactic unity of the global and the local, isespecially needed in China, where \*there was a strong tendency to transplant pedagogies of foreign origins into the Chinese educational context" (Hu, 2021, p. 29).

Our study also reflected how Chinese writing centers establish a diverse network of EAP writing support with various indigenous practices to address local needs. As ilustrated in Fig. 7, Chinese students' and faculty's growing need to publish in international journals, and thus the demand for linguistic, rhetorical, and discipline-specific expertise, along with the lack ofthis combined expertise in student tutors, all contribute to the choice of fculty as more desirable tutors, which is a common choice in many Asian and Eu ropean writing centers (e., Barnawi, 2018; Bonazza, 2016; McKinley, 2010; Nathan, 2021; Santa, 2009; Turner, 2006). The Chinese preference for faculty tutors reveals a cultural expectation that values what Chen and Wang (2022) describe as "epistemic asymmetry' (p. 1), which positions tutors as more knowledgeable than tutees, especially when it comes to ERPP writing centers that naturally lend themselves to faculty/professional tutoring given their high demand for discipline-specific expertise in high stakes writing for publication purposes. However, despite most participants' concerns about pee tutoring, two directors from our study expressed strong interest i recruiting peer tutors; similarly, studies such as Zhang (2019), Chen and Wang (2022), and Li (2018) discus the feasibility and benefits of training Chinese students to work as eer tutors at English writing centers at Chinese universities. Hence, we should not dismisspeer tutoring altogether but continue exploring optimal ways to harness it potential in EFL contexts, especially for EAP-EGP hybrid writing centers where peer tutors might make useful contributions within a diverse network of writing support.

Fig. 7. Missions and practices of glocal writing centers in the Chinese context: Model-in-progress

Chinese students' need for guidance and directive instruction has led to a mixed tutoring style, one that moves flexibly along the directive-nondirective continuum. This unanimous recognition aligns with the important call for promoting more flexibility in tutoring style and strategies to meet multilingual students' needs in North American writing center scholarship (e.g., Harrs & Silva, 1993; Rafoth, 2015; Thonus, 2004). The need for directive instruction at Chinese writig centers highlights tutors role as "academic guides and experts" of EAP writing (Nathan, 2021, p. 11), especially in demystifying complex challenges arising from ERPP writing, such as the demand for writers to \*take an independent view, only supported by th strength of their own argument, anapproach . arguably at odds with accepted behaviour in a collectivist society" (ElMalik & Nesi, 2008, p. 93). Additionally, Chinese writing center professionals openness to proofreading-a broadly banned service at North American writing centersaises from the product-oriented nature of ERPP writig. Nevertheless what is missing from our dataand should be brought to writing center directors attentionis the educative value of proofreading (Harwood, 2022) that focuses on \*enhancing the writer's composing process and rhetorical knowledge rather than ensuring an error-fre text" (p. 127) and cultivating writers selfditig sills (iu & Harwood, 2022a, 2022b) More efforts should be made to explore how tutors can work productively and educatively as literacy brokers or text mediators (Khuder & Petric, 2020; Lillis & Curry, 2010; Lu0 & Hyland, 2016), which might in turn sponsor Chinese students' and faculty's long-term writerly development.

Finally, by hosting special writing events, such as writing contests and academic symposiums, Chinese writing centers can serve as "ideal hubs" to implement systematic EAP interventions (Gustafsson & Ganobcsik-Wiliams, 2016, p. 525). For instance, writing contests commonly held by Chinese writing centers reflet popular trend of #" (promote writing with writing contess in China. Compared with North American writing centers that provide writing contests to communities through outreach programs (Harris, 1988), Chinese writing centers tend to host writing contests to arouse students interest in English writing and draw attention to the writing centera novel institutional service that most Chinese students might find unfamilia. Meanwhile, Chinese writing centers should further inquire into the impact/value of writing contests on EAP instruction.

We offr pedagogical and research implications based on our findings. Pedagogically, we propose utilizing writing centers as experimental sites for College English reform in China. The necessity and effctivenessof the EGP-to-EAP/ESP transition of College English instruction is stil hotly debated in China (e.g., Cai, 2013, 2020; Liu, 2020; Shu, 2020; Wen, 2014), rendering it risky for universities to implement an immediate EAP/ESP overhaul of College English. Given their need-driven nature, writing centers can offer individualized writing support and calibrated feedback to students with strong motivation and a need for EAP learning, thus functioning as arich pedagogical and research source, especiall for universtie that hope to make incremental fforts in reforming their Collge English program. Additionally, as with the drastic cut of credit hours for College English in recent years (Cai, 2017), writing centers can supplement the reduced English instruction and become an altenative venue where College English instructors "re-orient English teaching at the universty lel and use the instructional time more effectively" (Hu, 2021, p. 29, as suggested by some of our particiants. Rearch-wise, we suggest that data-driven asessment be conducted to examine the efectivenes and impact of glocal writing centers in ffering EAP writing support i higher educational internationalization both in China and beyond, e.g, how ERPP writing centers contribute to their home universities internationalization in terms of increasing international publications, improving the institution's global ranking, and promoting international academic exchange.

Admittedly, our study is limited in scope and methodology: we only interviewed eleven writing center professionals and focused on self-reports, lacking ethnographic data of diverse sources. Thus, we suggest that future research investigate Chinese and other international/glocal writing centers missions and practice from a wider range of institutional backgrounds and with various methods to collect on-site data (e.g., tutorials, workshops, and tutor training data to further study the actul implementation of missions and potential mismatches between missons and practices. In addition, the ERPP and EAP-EGP hybrid approaches highlighted in our study can serve s a baseline for future inquiry into additional writing center approaches in China and other international contexts; thus, we callfor arger-scale cross-intitutional studies that examine writing center missions and practices in various ocales across the globe, where writing center professonals imaginatively and contextually implement glocal writing centers that serve their unique institutional and national needs.

The indigenous missions and practices of Chinese writing centers revealed by our study extend the imaginative potential and flexible applicability of writing centers as a glocal practice and pedagogy of EAP writig. Changes enacted by writing centers often go beyond the center and can have a far-reaching impact at various levels, ranging from individual students to institutional reform of English instruction, and even contributing to national higher education intenationalization. We invite more scholarly attention to the development of glocal writing centers in China and beyond and to harnestheir potential for EAP writing instruction.
