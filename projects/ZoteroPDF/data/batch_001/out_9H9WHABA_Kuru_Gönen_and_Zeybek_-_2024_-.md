# ABSTRACT

This article describes the design and implementation of a training model on Multimodal Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (M-MALL) for EFL pre-service (PSTs) teachers. Albeit EFL teachers’ positive attitude towards technology integration into language teaching, they may still lack guidance and support on how to implement mobile technologies in their teaching contexts. Based on these, a training model to integrate M-MALL into PST education was suggested. An M-MALL training program was developed for the purposes of the study based on the needs, related literature, and the gap stemming from the lack of training opportunities in PST education. 16 PSTs studying in an ELT Department in Turkey participated. Following the implementation of a systematic eight-week training, participants were asked to write reflections on the training they received. The PSTs, in general, reported positive views on receiving training. Receiving such thorough training resulted in many gains for the participants such as improvement in teaching skills, expanding perspective on effective mobile technology integration, and being up to date as a teacher. The results have implications for language teachers and curriculum designers, and the suggested model provides a guideline for PST educators and language practitioners who would like to improve teaching competencies in a digital world.

# Introduction

New trends in education such as the integration of novel technologies (i.e. smart phones, interactional smart boards, online platforms) highlight the necessity to integrate digital tools into existing learning environments to transform and enhance learning (Ade-Ojo et  al., 2022; Torres Martín et  al., 2021). The studies emphasize that foreign language (FL) teachers generally have positive attitudes toward adopting novel Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the Internet in their language courses regardless of the teaching medium (blended or traditional) used in the schools (Mei et  al., 2018). However, FL teachers may lack the necessary knowledge and skills that can help them use ICTs at their hands effectively for language teaching purposes (Lozano & Izquierdo, 2019). Even though a variety of organizations and institutions underline the importance of digital competencies for teachers, there is still obscurity in how teacher training should pave the way for gaining these competencies to integrate technology into teaching (Aydın, 2017). That is, teacher training courses in general does not include courses or training programs available for teachers that specifically guide them in how to incorporate digital competencies into teaching contexts with concise materials and tasks.

Some researchers have asserted that insufficiencies in FL teacher education such as the lack of courses, training programs, and inadequacy of staff trained on the integration of technology into FL can be considered among the reasons for this unfavorable digital division among teachers (Hsu, 2016). This article aims to propose a training model of M-MALL integration into EFL teacher education by providing a sound rationale for the necessity of this model to overcome such insufficiencies, presenting a stepwise and systematic procedure to raise the awareness of practitioners, who would like to implement this model, with a clear reference to hands-on materials and tasks that can be used while integrating M-MALL into actual FL teaching contexts, and reflecting EFL pre-service teachers’ views and reactions to such training. Kuure et  al. (2016) indicated the necessity for FL teachers to know how to use ICTs in the classroom and be trained on designing effective language learning tasks via recent technologies. Similarly, Hsu, 2016 emphasized the gap in integrating ICTs into FL teacher education and pinpointed that teacher training programs should offer courses on how to optimize the effective use of ICTs in line with the curriculum requirements. While Lord and Lomicka (2011) indicated the importance of teachers’ familiarity with a wide variety of new technological tools, Lozano and Izquierdo (2019) underlined the fact that foreign language teachers should not just acquire the latest technologies, but also learn to implement them in a pedagogically sound way in the classroom.

Recent studies (e.g. Aydın, 2017; Kuru Gönen, 2019) assert the need for systematic training technology integration with main pillars of experience and reflection. Albeit the increasing emphasis on technology integration into FL PST education, studies do not offer training exclusively on recent advancements such as mobile technologies. Therefore, focusing on MALL in PST education as a specific technology integration approach would offer a more comprehensive and detailed model.

# Multimodal mobile-assisted language learning and EFL teacher training

The current study incorporates the aspects of MALL with the concept of multimodality that mobile technologies provide for language learning (Kukulska-Hulme et al., 2017). Multimodal mobile tools allow EFL learners to benefit from a wide range of modes such as sound, proxemics, gesture, image, and space which are brought together in a wide range of interactional communicative situations. This multimodal posture enables learners to understand the ‘dynamic interplay’ of communication combined with various modes that the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century puts forth. Thus, MALL pedagogy for FL teacher education aims at developing teachers’ multimodal literacies and awareness in designing and enhancing MALL lessons.

The integration of mobile devices into the English language learning process essentially provides multimodality for learners in making-meaning (Kukulska-Hulme et  al., 2017). According to Levitt (2017), multimodal MALL tools assist EFL learning through various channels to the brain and provide information through audio, video, image, color display, text, touchscreen, and interactive features. The recent developments in mobile technologies (i.e. smartphones and tablets) have enabled the integration of numerous sensors into conversational interfaces which made it possible to have multimodal interactions (Griol & Molina, 2016). Thus, the multimodality of these mobile tools helps learners find more accessible and usable learning environments since it facilitates adaptation to the digital environment considering the cognitive abilities and limitations of learners (Magal-Royo et  al., 2011). Besides, the interchangeable use of voice, stylus, or keyboard enables EFL learners to have multimodal communication, collaboration, and language rehearsal (Chua et  al., 2020). According to Chanier and Lamy (2017), language users combine linguistic and non-linguistic modes to convey messages in printed media, and in computer-mediated interactive language learning the variety of these resources increases. However, the presence of these tools and modes cannot be considered sufficient to cultivate multimodal language activities. The presentation methods need to be compatible with the capabilities of mobile tools and the cognitive capacity of learners to result in multimodal learning (Milutinović et  al., 2015).

Recent studies on English language teacher preparation generally focus on teacher perceptions towards technology integration (e.g. Inggita et  al., 2019; Lee et  al., 2019), and few studies investigated the teacher training process. A qualitative study by Yeh (2018) investigating PSTs’ perceptions in TESOL teacher preparation programs concluded that PSTs had neither support nor training for technology integration in their teaching during practicum and they only had a chance to observe their professors using technology during their courses in a TESOL program. Similarly, an international study conducted in Turkey, Poland, and Portugal investigated the views of PSTs and teacher educators on ICT integration in language teacher education programs and found that PSTs have a few opportunities for authentic technology experience, and there is a need for a specific and comprehensive training model for PST training (Aşık et  al., 2019). The importance of a stepwise systematic training model for successful technology integration into PST education has been highlighted previously (Kuru Gönen, 2019). The literature on teacher education for technology integrations, in general, demonstrates that although both EFL learners and teachers are eager and willing to use mobile tools for fruitful outcomes, there is still a need for professional guidance and training for EFL teachers. In PST education, the opportunities to integrate M-MALL are scarce and there is an obvious need to assist teacher candidates in selecting appropriate mobile tools and using them effectively in FL teaching. In addition to understanding how much prospective teachers accept mobile technologies, it is also necessary to guide them on how to integrate these mobile devices into their lessons. In this respect, providing training opportunities to teacher candidates on M-MALL integration in real classroom environments and revealing the strengths and weaknesses of such training would clear the way for enhanced future teaching experiences with technology. Considering all these, this study presents the development and integration of a comprehensive M-MALL training program into PST education in an EFL context and reports views of PSTs on the effectiveness of such training regarding actual classroom experiences. Thus, the study seeks to find the answer to the following research question:

What are the perceptions of EFL PSTs on the comprehensive M-MALL training they receive to integrate mobile technologies into actual teaching contexts?

Following the answer to this question, this study suggests a training model for FL PST education given at the end of the study along with certain implications.

# Method

This study was designed as a qualitative research study. Data were collected through PSTs’ reported reflections on the training they received on M-MALL practices. In this regard, the aim of the current study is to examine the underlying concepts grounded in the data to better understand the perceptions of PSTs on M-MALL training. Hence, it echoes the ideals of the Grounded Theory approach which focuses on examining the concepts grounded in the data (Starks & Brown Trinidad, 2007).

# Participants and context

A total of 16 PSTs studying in an English Language Teaching (ELT) Department at a state university in Turkey participated in this study. Convenient sampling strategy (Creswell, 2012) was adopted in the selection of the participants as they were available, accessible, and willing to use M-MALL in teaching practices. The PSTs in the study were fourth-year students who were enrolled in a school practice course in which they design lesson plans and teach at state schools. This school practice course requires the participants to visit the assigned state schools regularly, observe several activities within the actual teaching contexts (i.e. how the teachers organize teaching activities, official duties of the teachers, administrative procedures a teacher is responsible for, etc.), and conduct teaching activities in cooperation with the mentor teachers at the schools. This course does not include any aspect of technology integration and the participants did not receive any specific course or training related to this prior to the study. In the context of the study, various methodology courses on teaching are offered to the participants throughout a four-year training program. These courses provide micro-teaching experiences on subjects like ELT methodologies and approaches, linguistics, teaching English to young learners, and assessment of language skills and areas. There are no courses on the integration of mobile and computer technologies into English language teaching.

# Training on multimodal mobile-assisted language learning (M-MALL)

A training program on M-MALL for PSTs was developed by the researchers based on the relevant literature and M-MALL materials tested in prior piloting. The training was based on the stages of ECCR model of teacher development proposed by Son’s (2018) model which includes the stages of exploration, communication, collaboration, and reflection. Accordingly, teachers need to observe and explore technologies and resources which require checking the availability of technologies, consider the options, take technology-based courses, read related publications, attend related conferences, and implement one technology at a time to be able to handle it efficiently. Furthermore, they are expected to have communicative interactions with language learners, colleagues/peers, teacher educators, and researchers. Collaboration is also required from teachers to work together and share resources, ideas, and experiences, and reflective practice enables teachers to critically reflect on their teaching and learning experiences (Son, 2018). Furthermore, the concepts of ‘needs audit’ (the questioning of the necessity and the usefulness of the technology) (Bax, 2011) and ‘knowledge transfer’ (applying the abilities related to technology use into teaching) (Torsani, 2016) were integrated into the tasks of M-MALL training model. Accordingly, instead of exposing technology integration to language teachers, the concept of needs auditing was presented to PSTs so that they could evaluate the effectiveness of the technological tools they had in their hands for their teaching context. Furthermore, by reflecting on technological tools, their usage, and their effect, teachers could build up competencies to transfer technology in various contexts which enabled them to be creative in utilizing new technologies. Respectively, various materials and tasks were developed pertaining to mobile technology integration. Each step of the training along with the materials was overviewed and checked by five experienced researchers from the fields of ELT and Computer and Instructional Technologies. Necessary revisions were made, and the finalized training process was carried out for a total of eight weeks following six steps given in Table 1.

As visible in Table 1, the whole training process was based on gaining both information and hands-on experience on M-MALL integration to actual teaching contexts. The participants took an active part in each step and were trained comprehensively in selecting appropriate M-MALL tools, adapting textbook materials into M-MALL, designing teaching materials, transferring activities from written medium to digital medium, identifying problems and possible solutions, and applying M-MALL activities in micro-teaching contexts of teaching language skills. Figure  1 below demonstrates a sample task used in the awareness-raising step. For further details of the training process, please see ‘Supplementary Materials’.

A Multimodal Mobile Application Evaluation Checklist (see Supplementary Materials) was also designed and presented to the PSTs to help them identify and choose the most appropriate M-MALL applications for teaching practices. PSTs were given a sample multimodal mobile application list (see Figure 6, Supplementary Materials) and mostly chose among these applications, but not restricted to. A group of experts evaluated the appropriateness of the checklist and it included items for identifying the multimodality in a mobile application, identifying whether the application selected allows group work, collaboration, and feedback, and evaluating the features of the application.

# Instrument and data collection

# Reflective log

A Reflective log is suggested as an effective tool to gather detailed opinion on an experience (Jasper, 2005). After completing the eight-week-training process on M-MALL, the participants were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the whole training session and to write a detailed reflection log. The aim of this study was to design a systematic training on M-MALL integration and offer a training model for language practitioners. Thus, the participants’ views on the strengths and weaknesses of the training

TASK: Read the activities taken from a high school textbook. Decide on which activities are suitable for M-MALL transfer. Explain your reasons.

Figure 1. S ample task from awareness-raising stage.

pertaining actual teaching experiences helped to revise the whole training process and make necessary changes. The following guiding questions were posed to the participants to give details about their opinions and feelings regarding their M-MALL training experience in their reflective logs:

1. What do you think about the Training on M-MALL use in English language teaching that we covered for eight weeks? Write about your feelings and opinions regarding both positive and negative aspects (if any).   
2. What is your evaluation of the training on M-MALL use in English language teaching in terms of content and materials used?

# Data collection procedure

The following data collection procedures were followed in the study:

Since this study involved human participants, we obtained formal and prospective approval from an independent ethics committee regarding the appropriateness of the study design, instruments, and materials. Following this, the participants signed consent forms before the study assuring confidentiality of their participation and the data they provide. They were also ensured that they could withdraw anytime from the study since their active and collaborative participation was required.   
The steps of the M-MALL training were carried out for eight weeks with various tasks   
Following the training process on M-MALL, participants were asked to write reflection logs regarding the whole process. Electronically collected reflections were stored in a file and uploaded to the NVivo program for qualitative data analysis.   
Regarding the results of the qualitative data analysis, the training program was revised and a model for M-MALL training for PSTs was finalized.

# Data analysis

Reflections of PSTs regarding the whole M-MALL training process were analyzed qualitatively. The qualitative analysis focused on examining the concepts grounded in the data. Accordingly, the Constant Comparative Method (CCM) was used which allowed the use of actual data to generate categories instead of referring to preexisting categories (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). Following this method, the researchers started by coding each incident that reflected participants’ perceptions on M-MALL training and M-MALL integration in their teaching practices. The term code here refers to a single unit referring to any thought or feeling the participants communicated regarding the M-MALL training. In the second stage, similar incidents coded were gathered together into categories by constantly comparing and contrasting. This comparison switched from a comparison of incident-incident to category-category level. Afterward, the researchers continued with pairing off irrelevant properties, merging relevant details into major interrelated categories, and doing reductions where necessary. In the last step, the major themes emerged out of similar categories reflecting PSTs’ opinions. Ten percent of the data was rated by another researcher who was also experienced in qualitative data analysis. Although the appropriate size of the sample depends on many factors, around $1 0 \%$ of the total data is found to be enough to decide on inter-rater reliability (Lombard et  al., 2004). The percentage of agreement formula suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) was used to measure inter-rater reliability, and it was found .74 which indicated a good degree of reliability. To minimize the effect of reactivity and bias, further several online peer debriefing sessions were conducted with two expert researchers on qualitative data analysis. Finally, the identified themes and sub-themes were reviewed once again to make sure there was no overlapping.

# Results

Qualitative analysis of reflective diaries on the eight-week training program of M-MALL implementation revealed a total of 139 codes regarding the perceptions of the participants. All the codes identified here reflected the participants’ views of the M-MALL training they received. These codes were grouped under two main themes and a total of six sub-themes. The main themes were named as the professional gains and the training content related to the perceptions of PSTs on the whole process of training they received. The main themes and distribution of sub-themes are given in Table 2.

Detailed explanations concerning the main themes and sub-themes emerged from PSTs’ reflections are presented in the following sections with direct quotes from the data.

# Perceptions on professional gains

The PSTs mostly indicated they had several professional gains $( n = 8 3 )$ during the whole process. That is, receiving training on the integration of multimodal mobile technologies into ELT resulted in numerous gains related to teaching skills such as creating learner-centeredness, designing enjoyable, innovative, and non-monotonic lessons, breaking students’ prejudices against English, and integrating English into their daily lives. The PSTs asserted their views on how they could enrich their lessons by integrating M-MALL into their lessons as follows:

N\*: Number of codes.

Thanks to this training, I think my lessons will be fun and always desired, away from monotony and boredom. (PST4)

Unlike traditional approaches, lessons taught with the use of M-MALL mobile applications will create a process that puts EFL learners to the center and ensures their active participation in the lesson by learning and having fun without boring them during the lesson. (PST10)

EFL learners can sometimes be biased towards English and I think that this M-MALL training will help us, as teachers, a lot to break these prejudices. (PST14)

This training was very important for changing the EFL learners’ minds and easily integrating English into their real lives. (PST4)

As visible from the quotes above, participants gained an awareness on how to enhance their EFL learners’ active participation with the help of M-MALL and had an idea in how to stimulate learners’ motivation in quite innovative ways. Furthermore, thanks to M-MALL training the PSTs could help their learners integrate English into their daily lives with practical activities via their own smartphones. PSTs also stated that M-MALL training would help them design lessons in which M-MALL integration is necessary to enrich their teaching practices by taking their learners’ needs and interests into consideration. The participants indicated their views on how M-MALL can help them achieve such lessons as:

We can transfer a traditional fill in the blank activity, a reading or listening exercise presented in the textbook into a more enjoyable activity, and present it to the learners… So, they have more efficient lessons. (PST8)

Today, we know that technology helps us to access information quickly and using this technology in our lessons allows us to save time while affecting (positively) the attitude of learners towards the lesson. (PST7)

In language teaching, I think students should be taught by multimodal activities because each student’s learning style is different. Some students learn by seeing, others learn better by hearing. M-MALL training will provide us the opportunity to present them together. (PST16)

The quotes above pinpointed that M-MALL training was believed to help them transfer a plethora of so-called traditional activities presented in textbooks such as fill in the blanks or choose the correct option into more enjoyable and attractive ones with multimodal mobile tools; and in this way, the lessons would become more enriched. However, it is important to note here that we did not encourage PSTs to convert a simple fill in the blanks activity into an M-MALL practice for the sake of transferring a traditional activity into a digital one. Rather, the aim was to create an awareness on when and how M-MALL could be practical, necessary, and aligned with the outcomes of the lesson. Moreover, this training was also perceived by the PSTs to raise awareness on using mobile technologies in the classroom for saving time and accessing and using information during English lessons. Finally, as PST16 indicates, it was possible to approach the students with different learning styles such as auditory, visual, tactile, and kinesthetic via multimodal mobile technologies. The PSTs also believed that they could address learners’ needs and interests in a more individual way tailored to the actual needs in the classroom. As the name suggests, multimodal mobile applications offer their users to use various materials with several modes such as videos, animations, pictures, texts, or sounds for meaning making. Thus, the PSTs realized that they were able to use these multimodal tools to foster learning according to students’ preferences.

The participants asserted that receiving this training helped them develop and improve several strategies to integrate M-MALL into their future English lessons. In other words, after this training, they felt competent enough to use the ideas of M-MALL in their lessons. Some of the participants explained such an awareness on integration of M-MALL as follows:

During this eight-week training period, I successfully learned the use of M-MALL mobile applications, the purpose of the applications used, how they could be selected, how they were integrated into the lesson, and how I should prepare a related lesson plan. (PST5)

Although we are in the age of technology, I did not know about most mobile applications and I had never encountered others (given sample applications in the current study) except for a few applications before. With this 8-week training, I have gained information about many applications that can be effective in listening and reading skills, as well as writing and speaking skills, especially in English teaching, and the use of these applications and their integration into English teaching. And at the end of this process, I think it is very important as a teacher candidate to receive training on how to choose an appropriate mobile application for an appropriate activity especially for the skill I want the EFL learner to gain. (PST10)

According to PST5 above, the training was useful in providing them with the necessary information about how, where, and when to integrate M-MALL with appropriate multimodal mobile applications. As PST10 further indicates, this training was helpful for them to be able to design M-MALL lessons for various language skills such as reading, listening, writing, and speaking. She indicated that despite her lack of knowledge on various multimodal mobile applications and their potential use before the study, she learned how to choose an appropriate activity for M-MALL transfer and use appropriate M-MALL applications after the training. One participant further stated her views on the M-MALL learning process as follows:

We discussed whether various activities are suitable for M-MALL via various tasks; and thus, we got an idea about how to use mobile applications most effectively. All details about mobile applications, how to integrate them into the activity effectively, the advantages and disadvantages for students and teachers, and contributions they may have to English teaching were explained to us clearly by our instructor. (PST13)

M-MALL training was also perceived as helpful in keeping the participants up to date with the recent teaching methods and novel technologies used in EFL teaching. The PSTs indicated that they learned to be open to the new advancements in technology integration as one of them indicated in the following quote:

Our age is the age of technology as everyone knows. Considering this situation, I think that this training is very beneficial in that it will take us from classrooms that still do not contain technology in which ordinary lessons are taught, and put us into the classes that we both (with EFL learners) enjoy with technology. This will enable us to develop ourselves and our ELF learners much better. (PST16)

As expressed by the PST 16 above, the training would help them understand their EFL learners who would already be more engaged with technology in their daily lives. It is also worth highlighting here that this training aimed to teach PSTs the steps and procedures of M-MALL integration into EFL learning and not to promote an application to use directly in teaching. It is believed that the existing popular tools and applications today may not be available or practical in the future. The participants thought that M-MALL would contribute to their professional life as teachers since it enhanced their teaching skills and knowledge of multimodal mobile technology integration. Also, it would help them keep up with the latest advancement in the age of technology.

# Perceptions on the training content

The second main theme emerged from the qualitative data was the views of PSTs on the training content $\mathbf { \rho } ( n = 5 6 )$ they received. The codes in this main theme were grouped under three sub-themes. As the first sub-theme revealed, the materials of the training helped comprehend the concept and the processes of M-MALL better. PSTs stated that everything was introduced in clear and systematic steps with rich, detailed examples and in a multimodal way including various audio-visual and textual modes. Some of the PSTs conveyed their views on the comprehensibility of the content as follows:

I can say that the materials used (in the training) were thought out to the finest detail and laid the groundwork for a more understandable and beneficial training for us. (PST10)

We discussed whether the book activities can be transferred to M-MALL using the chosen applications. This allowed us to get more detailed information about the applications. (PST9)

In general, I can say that everything was clear and the materials used were very useful and instructive. (PST2)

As these PSTs’ statements quoted above indicate, the materials (i.e. the tasks and the lesson plans introduced, the M-MALL Mobile Application Evaluation Checklist, and so on) of the training were all found to be helpful, clear, informative, and detailed for PSTs to understand the concept of M-MALL and its integration processes. This revealed the importance of careful guidance teacher candidates needed to understand and integrate the ideas of M-MALL into their teaching practices. The participants stated their thoughts on receiving such guidance as:

In this modelling process, the sample application choices for the activities determined for each skill area and the sample materials demonstrated helped to design detailed lesson plans, and this procedure highlighted where we should pay attention to (in lesson planning; and thus, such an approach have taken us (PSTs) one step further. (PST10)

Not only the training was theoretical, but also our teacher taught exemplary lessons in the classroom. At the end of the training, we also reinforced the training we received with the micro-teaching lessons we did. (PST11)

Practical demonstration during the training helped me understand the purpose and use of the mobile applications better. (PTS6)

According to PSTs 10, 11, and 6, the modeling technique implemented in this study to demonstrate and teach how to design an M-MALL integrated lesson was found to be quite beneficial for PTS to understand how this integration might take place in practice. The participants also stated their views on the usefulness of micro-teaching sessions (i.e. teaching M-MALL enriched activities to their peers in training) at the final steps of the training as:

In the last weeks of the training, we conducted micro-teaching in small groups. After the last week’s implementation part, things about M-MALL applications have become clearer in my mind. (PST3)

At the end of the training, we practiced everything we had acquired in this process with the micro-teaching lessons. I can say that the micro-teaching lessons our friends conducted also contributed a lot because I got new ideas by seeing different perspectives. (PST7)

The last micro-teaching lesson we prepared has enabled us to be involved in M-MALL more, and the feedback and comments given in this process provided a clearer understanding of the concept. (PST15)

According to the above statements, the micro-teaching lessons held by the participants in groups were found to be quite fruitful in fostering the knowledge and ideals of M-MALL integration. Moreover, the presentation of the content was found effective to understand the importance of the training process and the integration of M-MALL better. That is, categorization in the content display, the systematic organization of topics for each week going from easy to difficult, and support from the instructor and peers made M-MALL training more comprehensible and notable. M-MALL mobile applications were presented in groups based on their features (i.e. video-based tools, quiz tools, etc.) addressing teaching and practicing different language skills and structures. The PSTs were introduced to these categories with various sample applications along with textbook activities for each category to help them decide on the appropriate textbook activity for M-MALL implementation. One of the participant’s views on the benefit of categorization is as follows:

The applications consisted of seven groups and supporting each group with associated activities also led to more meaningful and permanent learning. (PST10)

PSTs’ views regarding the materials and content of M-MALL training revealed mainly positive views and highlighted the detailed, informative, and organized nature of the training process. Furthermore, the PSTs were satisfied with the trainer and marked that this training was given eagerly, enthusiastically, and in a supportive manner. This underlined the importance of the trainer’s approach in creating a favorable and motivating atmosphere for M-MALL integration. Even though this study attempted to reveal all aspects of the M-MALL training regarding both strengths and weaknesses, qualitative analysis revealed that participants favored this training, had several professional gains at the end, and appreciated various aspects of its content. Thus, the findings displayed only the positive aspects of the training process with respect to the participants’ views. All in all, the M-MALL training was perceived fruitful in terms of promoting PSTs’ teaching skills, integrating M-MALL into practice, keeping up to date with recent technologies, and fostering positive feelings towards technology integration. With the help of this hands-on training, they gained confidence in integrating mobile technologies into language classes and they were ready to apply what they learned throughout the training to real-life classroom contexts.

# Discussion and conclusion

The findings on the views of PSTs on M-MALL training disclosed PSTs’ gains in teaching skills, knowledge of M-MALL integration, and accessing the updated information. The aim of this study is not to present technology integration as a solution to all problems in the EFL contexts; rather, it intends to propose a stepwise training with clear guidelines and materials to raise pre-service teachers’ awareness on M-MALL integration and to report participant preservice teachers’ views on this. The participants found this training quite advantageous in contributing to their teaching skills. Previous studies highlighted the importance of guiding EFL teacher candidates on how, where, and when to use mobile technologies in their lessons by stressing the need for comprehensive training specifically designed for EFL teachers. However, most PSTs today graduate with lack of knowledge on practical integration of technologies with hands-on experiences (Lozano & Izquierdo, 2019). Thus, echoing the views of PSTs in this study, the training might have provided the opportunity for them to enhance their actual teaching practices through technology integration. With the latest curricula offered in many ELT programs, the necessity for equipping PSTs with M-MALL has become more and more important since there are no subject-specific courses that guide teacher candidates to use mobile technologies in their future lessons (Batane & Ngwako, 2017).

Recently, the world in general has been facing many unexpected problems such as epidemics and natural disasters. In such problematic situations, formal education is either interrupted or tried to be continued in the form of (emergency) distance education. Although educators, families, and students try to keep up with these sudden and unexpected changes, there may be some problems in terms of the technologies used and accessed to carry out educational intentions. At this point, the digital divide (inequalities in accessing and using ICTs) plays an important role in determining the success or the failure of technology use in educational settings (Izquierdo et  al., 2017). The problems may be difficult to overcome at the national level, and great efforts may be required to solve the problems stemming from digital inequality. However, apart from these problems, a great deal falls on the part of the teachers since the teachers may determine many stages of the learning process from the design of the lessons to their implementation. As put forward in this study, when EFL teachers understand the necessity of using the latest technologies in the classroom through comprehensive training, then maintaining the quality of education can become possible in unexpected times. In this respect, this training once again revived that technology is an indispensable part of education. As Bax (2003) says, when a technologic tool is transformed into an ordinary educational tool such as a pencil or a book, and becomes normalized, then the most efficient results can become visible in technology integration. Therefore, this training might have opened a way for PSTs to normalize the process of M-MALL implementation in their classrooms in a stepwise fashion. Moreover, as emphasized by Chao (2015), prospective English teachers need to transfer these skills into long-term teaching practices. Thus, considering the efforts of presenting a systematic guide for M-MALL integration in this study and enthusiasm of PSTs to integrate M-MALL in their future practices, it may be possible to expect the teacher candidates to transfer the knowledge they gained in the training and blend them with updated information when necessary in their future teaching contexts. The importance of reconstructing the skills of technology implementation with each novel technology has been emphasized by Torsani (2016). Hence, the training may have also helped PSTs develop the necessary skills for restoring their knowledge on M-MALL integration in their future lessons as the participants found ideas of M-MALL useful in bridging the generation gap with their prospective students. Including recent favorable technological tools into foreign language teaching can help English teachers better motivate their technologically preeminent learners.

In addition to the perceptions of PSTs on the gains from this training, the content of this training was found quite satisfying and helpful by the participants. Former teacher training models have put forward several implications such as modeling, collaboration, reflection, transfer, and reconstruction of knowledge that were considered as necessary in teacher training on technology integration (Kuru Gönen, 2019; Son, 2018). Considering all these views, M-MALL training included various stages that enabled PSTs to practice M-MALL both in theory and in practice. Throughout the eight-week training procedure, the participants were further reflected on their learning process in each step either by in-class discussions or by guided reflection questions. The importance of reflectivity in fostering teaching skills has been highlighted by various researchers previously (e.g. Hung, 2012; Tseng et  al., 2016). Hence, it can be stated that the stepwise process followed, and the materials designed for this training might have fostered English teacher candidates to monitor their improvement in practicing the integration of M-MALL in their teaching experiences collaboratively and reflectively. According to Batane and Ngwako (2017), modeling is an important method in the teaching profession to help PSTs understand and develop their skills in teaching. Teo and Noyes (2014) further asserted that prospective teachers need to observe and understand the teacher educators as models of technology use; and thus, teacher educators have the responsibility in displaying the modeling of novel technologies in their lessons. Hence, modeling technique adopted in this study might have helped PSTs visualize how their lessons can be enhanced via mobile technologies. Moreover, as suggested by Son (2018), collaboration with peers and experienced ones plays a significant role in constructivist views of teacher education for technology use. Therefore, constructive feedback given to PSTs’ endeavors might have secured the implementation of M-MALL successfully during the training. Such an elaborative training model on mobile technology integration can be considered to enhance PSTs’ skills in multimodal mobile technology integration into EFL teaching.

PSTs repeatedly expressed that they felt self-content regarding the training they received. Osakwe et  al. (2017) similarly found out that teachers would be happy to be introduced to the use of various novel mobile devices for teaching. On the other hand, even though the PSTs were quite content to use mobile technologies in their future classrooms, they may feel insufficient and insecure about such integration without guidance (Batane & Ngwako, 2017). Therefore, the results of this study might indicate that supporting EFL teachers with the necessary knowledge on M-MALL integration, guiding them in their endeavors in a systematic way through constructive feedback and reflection may evoke contentment along with other positive feelings towards technology use. Such detailed and supportive training provided in this study might have led provoked satisfaction in PSTs towards the implementation of M-MALL in general. Based on the effectiveness of the systematic training provided regarding the views of the PSTs, this study proposes a training model for language teacher educators and language practitioners to implement the ideas of M-MALL into pre-service FL teacher education. With the help of this model given in Figure 2, practitioners are offered comprehensive guidance in a step-bystep fashion to effectively integrate M-MALL in language teaching with awareness. Teacher educators can benefit from this training model to create awareness of the ideals of M-MALL integration, show ways to enhance language lessons with the appropriate mobile technologies tailored to students’ needs, transfer existing textbook materials into interesting, practical, and motivating mobile mediums, and deal with potential problems. In this new era of digital transformation, such a training model may assist PSTs in finding out the most appropriate mobile tools for language teaching purposes, integrating mobile technologies to increase interest in language learning, and thinking creatively out of the box to build up a rapport with students before they step into professional teaching life.

Integrating technology into language teaching is not a novel idea and there are various suggested models for technology education (see Kuru Gönen, 2019; Son, 2018). However, the M-MALL teacher training model suggested here is specifically designed for effective integration of mobile technologies into language teacher education; and thus, differs from existing technology integration models. That is, this model not only creates awareness on how to select and use mobile tools for language teaching, but it also provides comprehensive guidance for teacher educators on leading PSTs in how to transfer traditional materials into mobile platforms, and deal with problems via continuous hands-on practices and micro-teaching experiences. Thus, the model suggested here may help teacher educators’ foster digital competence in language teaching and help PSTs gain confidence in using mobile technologies with appropriate knowledge and experience.

# Implications and limitations

The current study is believed to provide new insights and pedagogical implications into mobile technology integration into EFL teaching. To begin with, many curricula followed in ELT departments do not offer specific courses to integrate technology into EFL teaching. Therefore, most PSTs graduate without having the necessary knowledge of using recent technologies to enhance teaching English. In this respect, technology-based new courses can be added to the ELT curriculum in which PSTs are informed and guided on integrating the most recent technologies such as M-MALL suggested in this study. Since technology is a path full of new advancements, it is unpredictable what new technologies can bring forward new improvements. Thus, it is recommended here to train PSTs and offer them courses on using smartphones which are the recent and most popular mobile devices with multimodal applications to teach English. Apart from the courses that can be embedded into the ELT curriculum, PSTs can hold or attend seminars, conferences, and workshops which guide them on M-MALL integration. The PSTs can either arrange these events and discuss and share their own experiences with the recent multimodal mobile technologies through a Community of Practice (CoP) or they can be encouraged to attend such events held by academic institutions (Hanson-Smith, 2016).

Another implication related to the training of PSTs can be including technology-based requirements into courses with micro-teaching experiences. In this way, the PSTs can have a chance to practice technology integration in content-specific areas of ELT and will be exposed to the use of technology more compared to having only a one-shot course for technology integration. PSTs can also be encouraged to reflect on their learning through M-MALL, become aware of the strengths and weaknesses of M-MALL mobile applications, and adjust their future teaching practices using these technologies. Training of in-service EFL teachers is also suggested here to enhance M-MALL practices at schools. As previously suggested (i.e. Teo & Noyes, 2014; Osakwe et  al., 2017), the need for training on how to integrate technology in EFL lessons is the primary issue that needs to be considered. Therefore, offering training seminars or workshops for in-service EFL teachers can help them develop the necessary skills and practice implementation of M-MALL into actual language teaching contexts. Such a stance also echoes the idea of creating rich and enhanced lessons with teachers who effectively use technology.

This study focused on the perceptions of participants towards M-MALL training after they received this training and experienced M-MALL integration; and thus, the results are limited to the reflections of the pre-service teachers. Other factors such as individual differences, personality traits, and prior experiences that may affect the possible change in participants’ perceptions were not taken into consideration within the scope of the current study. Future studies can be conducted on in other EFL teacher training context by taking other factors into consideration in a more longitudinal fashion. Even though the results are restricted to a single EFL teaching context and hard to generalize to other contexts of pre-service teacher education, the development and implementation of M-MALL training model presented here can shed light on further implementations of M-MALL in other foreign language teacher education programs.
