# Abstract

Each genre favours some linguistic structures and elements over others. The present paper reveals the usefulness of corpus-based analysis to discover the linguistic patterns selected and favoured by a speci®c genre. It analyzes the use of collocational frameworks, or discontinuous sequences of words, in a corpus of medical research papers and describes the intermediate words, or collocates, which ®ll these frameworks.

The results show that the frameworks the . . . of, a . . . of, and be . . . to, when used in medical papers, enclose restricted sets of lexical items and that the selection of speci®c collocates for these frameworks is conditioned by the linguistic conventions of the genre. $©$ 1999 The American University.

# 1. Introduction

The prepatterned nature of speech has been the focus of a high number of studies, which have analyzed continuous sequences of words which recur in language (Altenberg, 1993; Kjellmer, 1991; Moon, 1994; Nattinger & DeCarrico, 1992; Sinclair & Renouf, 1988). The underlying assumption of these studies is that the idiom principle (Sinclair, 1991) is crucial to understand the production of texts: language includes \`\`a large number of semi-preconstructed phrases that constitute single choices'' (Sinclair, 1991: 110), that is, it has an important phraseological component. Nattinger (1980)(:76) describes language use as a \`\`\`compositional process', which consists in \`stitching together' preassembled phrases''.

The consideration of language as a phraseological system is in opposition to the traditional clear-cut distinction between lexis and grammar. The concept of collocational frameworks (Renouf & Sinclair, 1991), or discontinuous sequences of words, has been useful in that it has revealed that the prepatterning of language is not only concerned with lexical words, but also with grammatical words. It has been shown that grammatical frameworks, such as works, such as be . . . to, for . . . of or $a \dots o f$ tend to enclose speci®c sets of words, which are lexically or functionally related, and that the choice of the collocate enclosed within the framework is determined by the elements of this framework (Renouf & Sinclair, 1991; Eeg-Olofsson & Altenberg, 1994). Here we will consider only frameworks whose ®ller is a single word (or a word and its modi®ers), that is, frameworks of the type $X ( \mathrm { M o d i f i e r } ) Y X$ , where $X$ stands for the members of the framework and Y for the collocate, which may be modi®ed (e.g., the framework the. . .of in the wide range of). In this paper we intend to determine which intermediate words, or collocates, are enclosed within the frameworks that are common in the medical research paper. We will examine whether the rhetorical aims of this genre condition the collocates selected by these frameworks.

Most corpus studies in ESP have been register-based and have revealed the existence of linguistic dierences across registers (Biber, 1988, 1992). Halliday de®nes register as \`\`a cluster of associated features having a greater-than-random (or rather, greater than predicted by their unconditioned probabilities) tendency to co-occur'' (1988: 162). Biber's (1988) study reveals that scienti®c discourse is characterized by very frequent occurrences of nouns, long words, prepositions, conjuncts, agentless and by-passives, past participial adverbial clauses and by markedly infrequent occurrences of private verbs, contractions and that-deletions.

Fewer corpus studies in ESP have been genre-based (e.g., Biber 1994; Gledhill, 1995). In ESP, genre has been de®ned as a conventionalized communicative event whose form and linguistic features are determined by the practices and conventions of the discourse community to which the text is addressed (see Swales, 1990). This implies that linguistic features, including phraseological patterns, must be analyzed by taking account of the speci®c social context where a genre is produced. An interesting genre-based study of phraseology is that by Gledhill (1995), who analyzes the phraseology of grammatical items in cancer research articles. He shows that there is a relation between phraseological patterns and the most typical rhetorical functions of the research article sections.

We follow a genre approach here to study the grammatical frameworks in the medical research paper. Before analyzing these frameworks we will describe brie¯y some conventions that govern the writing of the research paper and the linguistic features of this genre which are relevant for the study.

# 2. The research paper

Merton (1973) identi®ed four norms that de®ne the ethos of science: universalism, communism (i.e., sharing knowledge), disinterestedness, and organized skepticism when approaching claims. Disinterestedness is re¯ected in the paper by the absence of the authors/researchers, implying that they have no personal interest in proving that a particular claim is true. In scienti®c discourse, authorial personality is excluded and the object of the research is foregrounded, in this way conveying the impression of objectivity (Nash, 1990). This is one of the reasons for the use of grammatical structures which help to avoid mentioning the agent (e.g., passives, nominalizations).

One of the most prominent features of scienti®c discourse is the occurrence of nominalizations, which package representations of processes and attributes (Halliday, 1988). Halliday describes the world of written scienti®c discourse as \`\`a nominalized world with high lexical density and packed grammatical metaphors''1 (1987: 149). Lemke (1990: 440) considers nominalizations in scienti®c discourse as the most obvious case of a more general feature of this type of discourse, condensation. The packaging of a complete activity (a process with its participants and circumstances) in a nominalization allows the whole activity to be named with the process noun, as we can see in example 1. The process discontinue is realized by the grammatical metaphor \`\`the discontinuation of digoxin'', and not by a verb (i.e., \`\`digoxin is discontinued'', or \`\`we discontinue digoxin'').

(1) The discontinuation of digoxin carries considerable hazards for patients with heart failure (NEJM, Packer, M. et al., 1993).

Using a nominalization the whole activity \`\`can be quali®ed and related to other activities in a highly condensed manner'' (Lemke, 1990: 440). The use of grammatical metaphors to realize processes and attributes in scienti®c discourse accounts for the high number in this type of discourse of nominal groups whose head is the name of an attribute (e.g., the high speci®city of a sequential screening protocol) or of a process (e.g., the discontinuation of digoxin), and which tend to be quali®ed by a prepositional phrase (e.g., of digoxin).

Another prototypical feature of scienti®c discourse pointed out by Halliday (1988) is the prevalence of relational intensive processes, realized by verbal elements which relate nominalized processes externally (i.e., happening A causes happening B) or internally (i.e., happening A causes me to think/proves happening B). A very common pattern in scienti®c discourse is a simple clause consisting of process (nominal group)Ðrelation (verbal group)Ðprocess (nominal group), where the nominal elements convey the whole of the semantic content, and the verbal group is used to express the relationship between nominalized processes (Halliday, 1988: 171). This pattern is related to another feature of scienti®c discourse: the rare occurrence of animate agents, especially the researcher. Human agents are hidden with the use of agentless passives and of nominalizations, by means of which processes can be rei®ed and, thus, be used as agents (Lemke, 1990: 439). As we have said, the absence of the researcher contributes to conveying the impression that this type of discourse is a \`\`value-neutral'' objective description of facts.

The research paper is considered the most highly valued genre used by scienti®c discourse communities (Knorr-Cetina, 1981; Swales, 1990). Thus, the conventions of scienti®c discourse and the linguistic features which re¯ect and realize these conventions can be clearly observed in the research paper. Myers' (1990, 1994) explains the linguistic features prevalent in research papers in terms of the view of science re¯ected in this genre:

The professional articles create what I call a narrative of science; they follow the argument of the scientist, arrange time into a parallel series of simultaneous events all supporting their claim, and emphasize in their syntax and vocabulary the conceptual structure of the discipline (Myers, 1990: 142).

Passive structures are used with the purpose of emphasizing the entities studied, and not the researcher's actions. The juxtaposition of simultaneous events is realized on the syntactic level by the use of \`\`complex phrases that bring a number of clauses into the same sentence, asserting them at once'' (Myers, 1994: 186), which implies the use of nominalizations.

The impression of organized skepticism (Merton, 1973) when approaching claims is also created through language. This norm is re¯ected in the modi®cation of assertions to indicate explicitly the authors' degree of con®dence in the truth of these assertions. Since the authors are expected to provide evidence for the reliability of their claims and to qualify their assertions (Myers, 1994; Nash, 1990), they use epistemic modality to distinguish and help the reader distinguish between opinions, inferences and facts. Language is used to indicate what is known, considered, supposed, and so forth. Claims made in research papers are questionable and open to challenge. Hence, the tentative character of statements.

The corpus for this research is made up of 100 medical papers 50 from the New England Journal of Medicine (Appendix A) and 50 from the British Medical Journal (Appendix B. The total number of words is 298,457. The New England Journal of Medicine and the British Medical Journal have been chosen because they are leading medical journals \`\`considered to contain the best scienti®c journalism'' (Salager-Meyer, 1994: 155). They are amongst the four medical journals most often consulted all over the world and included in the bases Index Medicus and Medline (Bobenrieth, 1994: 13). The papers were placed on a computer hard disk and analyzed by means of a concordance generator.

# 3. Results: analysis of collocational frameworks

The most common frameworks in our corpus are: the. . .of (e.g., the number of ), $b e ^ { 2 } . . . t o$ (e.g., be similar to), a . . . of (e.g., a variety of ), we . . . that (e.g., we calculated that), the . . . that (e.g., the hypothesis that). Owing to space constraints in this paper we will only examine the three most frequent: the . . . of, be . . . to, and a . . . of.

Table 1 shows the ratio between the tokens of these frameworks, or total number of occurrences of each framework in the corpus, and the types, or the number of dierent collocates of each framework. For instance, the number of and the percentage of are types of the framework the . . .of.

The frame the. . .of occurs with 1150 dierent collocates in the corpus, which indicates its high productivity: a high number of word types may occur as ®llers of the frame. The frames be. . .to and a. . .of are less productive: be. . .to occurs with 81 dierent collocates, and the frame a. . . of occurs with 98 dierent collocates in the corpus.

We calculated the type/token ratio of the collocates to obtain an indication of the internal variability of the frame. Internal variability measures whether the frame is highly selective of its collocates or it is more variable. When the \`\`type'' ®gure is high in relation to the \`\`token'' ®gure, this indicates a low internal variability: the framework is highly selective of its collocates. An example of a framework with an extremely low internal variability is going . . . be, which selects only one collocate type: to (Eeg-Olofsson & Altenberg, 1994). Eeg-Olofsson and Altenberg (1994) found that when the internal variability of the framework is low, the type/token ratio approaches zero and when it is high the type/token ratio approaches 1. As Table 1 shows, when used in medical research papers the frames analyzed have a low internal variability, which means that there is a considerable number of collocates which occur with high frequency.

We will consider each of these frameworks in turn:

# 3.1. The framework the . . . of

Table 2 lists the top twenty collocates of this framework. The ®rst column shows the occurrences of the collocates as ®llers of the frame. The second column shows the total number of occurrences of each collocate in the corpus.

As can be seen in Table 2 the triplets composed of the framework and the collocates dier in terms of the strength of the collocation. For instance, although 150 occurrences of risk are ®llers of the frame the . . . of, this number only represents $2 9 . 8 \%$ of the total occurrences of risk (506). Table 3 lists the collocates with the highest proportion of occurrences as ®llers of the framework the . . . of.

All the occurrences of start $( 1 0 0 \% )$ in the corpus occur in the framework the . . . of. The start of is, thus, the highest collocation. The table shows that particular lexical items occur only or mainly in certain frameworks, and therefore shows the importance of phrases to the lexical pro®le of medical research articles. $1 0 0 \%$ of the occurrences of start occur in the triplet the start of, $9 4 . 8 7 \%$ of occurrences of basis in the triplet thebasis of, $84 \%$ of occurrences of presence in the triplet the presence of, and so on.

It is interesting to see which are the collocates attracted by the framework the . . . of in the medical paper. For the subsequent discussion of these collocates all the ®llers of the frame have been taken into account, not only the most frequent (Table 2) or the most signi®cant ones (Table 3). These collocates can be classi®ed into six groups:

(1) Items expressing measure, quanti®cation such as amount, degree, dose, extent, frequency, incidence, intake, majority, number, percentage, prevalence, proportion, rate.

(2a) A higher dietary calcium intake may decrease the incidence of symptomatic kidney stones (NEJM, Curhan et al., 1993). . . . . .(2b) using the method of Haddow et al. to estimate the number of cases of Downs syndrome (BMJ, Spencer et al., 1993).

The triplets including these items (e.g., the amount/number of . . . ) are followed by nouns referring to the elements of the research that need to be quanti®ed, such as the object of study or the materials: illnesses, drugs, patients (e.g., the amount of trimethylamine N-oxide; the number of striol-treated women). The items that precede these triplets re¯ect three major patterns, listed here in order of frequency. The triplets are frequently preceded by reporting verbs like list or show whose subject is, table, ®gure (e.g., Table 1 shows/lists the number/rate/percentage of . . . ). This pattern occurs when the author wants to present additional non-linear information without disrupting the development of the text. It is used in metadiscursive statements which give the location of data. The high frequency of these triplets in this move of the paper is due to the fact that tables and ®gures in medical research papers usually present numerical or statistical data. The triplets can also be preceded by verbs or nominalizations referring to changes in quantity (e.g., increase/decrease in the number/frequency/incidence of . . . ). Finally, the triplets also occur immediately preceded by a verb expressing the purpose of the research, usually in move 3 of the Introduction, \`\`Occupying the nich'' (Swales, 1990)(e.g., determine/estimate/®nd the number/frequency/incidence of. . .).

(2) Nominalizations expressing medical procedures or steps of the treatment. Such as addition, administration, diagnosis, measurement, use.

(3) . . . symptoms may be suppressed by the use of drugs (BMJ) (Mientjes et al., 1993).

The triplets including these items (e.g. the addition/administration of . . . ) are usually followed by a noun referring to a drug. The relationship between the collocate and this noun is similar to that of \`\`verb-object'' (i.e., the addition of $X$ is similar to we added $X _ { i }$ ). $5 7 . 5 \%$ of the occurrences of these triplets are preceded by prepositions, such as before, after, despite, with, by (e.g., after the administration of $X$ ; with the use of $X$ ).

These triplets are grammatical metaphors which constitute an incongruent realization of a process,whose congruent realization would be a verb preceded by the subject we (i.e., the noun administration in the administration of $X$ is agnate to the verb administer in we administered $X$ ).3 The use of these triplets contributes to the hiding of the agency of the researcher and to presenting the experiment in an impersonal way, as a process where human activity is backgrounded.

(3) Nominalizations expressing qualities or properties. Such as ability, abnormality, availability, eectiveness, ecacy.

(4) To compare the ecacy of terbina®ne $1 \%$ cream and clotrimazole $1 \%$ (BMJ, Evans et al., 1993).

These collocates express a quality of the noun that follows the framework (e.g., the ability of the model; the availability of the data; the eectiveness of the agonist). These triplets are also grammatical metaphors: an attribute is realized by a noun and not by an adjective, which is its congruent realization (i.e., the availability of the data is agnate to the data are available).

(4) Nominalizations expressing existence/non-existence such as absence, distribution, lack, occurrence, presence.

(5) Viability appears to be associated with the presence of collateral blood ¯ow within the infarct bed (NEJM, Sabia et al. 1992).

These triplets are related to items that establish causal relationships, either external (i.e., happening A is the cause of happening B) or internal (happening A is the proof of happening B) (Halliday, 1988): $X$ is related to the presence/absence of Y; $X$ indicates/reveals the absence/presence of Y.

In $2 5 . 8 \%$ of the occurrences of the triplet the absence of and $1 9 . 3 \%$ of the occurrences of the triplet the presence of, collocation occurs with the preposition in: in the absence of. The whole sequence has a conditional meaning and is frequently followed by clauses including a modal verb which expresses tentativeness (e.g., in the absence/presence of $X$ , Y can be done/ $Y$ may be true, is used to express if $X$ is absent/present, Y can be done/ $Y$ may be true).

(6) In the presence of a potent mast-cell bronchoconstrictor stimulus, such an allergen, this short-term protective eect may be impaired even more (NEJM, O'Connor et al. 1992).

The triplet the lack of is followed by abstract nouns (i.e., the lack of dierence/ eect/improvement/ecacy was not due to) to indicate that the expected results did not occur. Due to is a frequent collocate of the lack of.

(5) Itemsexpressing a moment of time in a process, such as beginning, development, end, onset, start.

(7). . .which can be achieved by reperfusion only in the ®rst few hours after the onset of myocardial infarction (NEJM, Sabia et al., 1992).

The triplets including beginning, development and onset are followed by items referring to illnesses (e.g., the development/onset of the illness). The triplets the start/end of are followed by treatment or study and preceded by a preposition like at (after/before/at the start/end of treatment/the study).

(6) Items used to focus on an aspect of some element of the research4 such as cause, eect, risk, results(s), role, characteristics, bene®ts.

(8) the results of this meta-analysis con®rm the 1987 World Health Organization recommendation to give vitamin A to children with measles (BMJ, Glasziou et al., 1993).

The triplets including these items (e.g., the eect(s)/results(s)/role of . . . ) are followed by a noun naming a drug or by a nominalization expressing an action in the treatment. The collocate selects the aspect of this noun which is relevant in the context. These triplets occur in various moves in the research paper. They occur frequently at the beginning of the paper, in move 3 \`\`Occupying the niche'' (Swales, 1990). They are preceded by verbs which refer to the experimental activity, such as examine or determine, to express the purpose of the research (examine/determine/evaluate/ assess/investigate/ascertain/compare the eect/role/ cause of $X$ ). This is consistent with the nature of medical research, concerned with the explanation of unknown phenomena (Adams-Smith, 1987). They can also be preceded by reporting verbs, in order to present the research (we/this paper present(s)/describe(s)/report(s) the results/eect of . . . ). Reporting verbs may also precede these items when they are part of clauses which point to a graphic presentation of results (Table 1 presents the results of . . . ). Finally, the triplet the results(s) of occurs when the authors want to relate their research to others, in the move \`\`Reference to previous research'' (Swales, 1990) (based on/derived from the results of previous studies).

The triplet the risk(s) of is always followed by a negative item (e.g., infection, jaundice, mortality). That is, it has a negative semantic prosody (Stubbs, 1996). It is preceded by verbs with causative meaning, either verbs that refer to a change of quantity (increase/decrease/reduce the risk of infection), or verbs that express the existence of a connection (related/associated with/to the risk of ).

The framework the . . . of is also frequently used with the nouns criteria and method. The authors of a medical paper must show that the research involving patients adheres to established ethical criteria and that the method used is reliable. These triplets, which occur in the Methods section, are part of patterns which justify and describe the scienti®c method: According/adhering to the criteria of the $X$ medical society/organization; the method of $X$ was used. The frequency of the triplet the method of $X$ can be accounted for in terms of the shared knowledge of the medical community. The authors do not need to describe the method used because it is already known by the readers, which contributes to the economy required in research papers.

Finally the framework the. . .of may be preceded by some prepositions and enclose speci®c items forming various set phrases: on the basis of, at the time of, (at, under, over) the age of, for the purpose of.

# 3.1.1. The framework a . . . of

This framework is much less productive than the . . . of. Table 4 shows the top twenty collocates of this framework.

We can compare the list of the top twenty collocates in the corpus with that obtained in a study by Renouf and Sinclair (1991) based on the Birmingham Collection of English Texts. The twenty most frequent collocates of $a \dots o f$ in the Birmingham collection were the following (in decreasing order): lot, kind, number, couple, matter, sort, series, piece, bit, sense, pair, member, group, result, part, variety, state, bottle, man, quarter. We can see that the top twenty collocates in both corpora do not coincide. This suggests that the ®llers of collocational frameworks may vary depending on the type of discourse and that the collocation of the framework a . . . of with the set of ®llers listed in Table 4 may be typical of medical research papers.

Table 5 lists the collocates with the highest proportion of occurrences as ®llers of the framework a . . . of.

Most of the collocates in the framework $a \dots o f$ are subtechnical nouns, that is, \`\`items which are neither highly technical and speci®c to a certain ®eld of knowledge nor obviously general in the sense of being everyday words which are not used in a distinctive way in specialized texts'' (Baker, 1988: 91). In a previous study Renouf and Sinclair (1991) showed that this framework produces various types of of-quanti®ers (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech & Svartik, 1985). In the corpus, most collocates of the framework a . . .of belong to one of the following two groups:

(1) Items expressing quantity such as dose, group, measure, minority, number, percentage, period, proportion, range, series, subgroup, total.

(9) We have reported an association between epidural anaesthesia and a range of long term symptoms (BMJ, MacArthur et al., 1992).

Some of them are used to introduce an exact quantity or amount: a total of 900 alleles, a rate of 2 60/min. Other collocates, which express a vague quantity or amount, are preceded by adjectives like large, wide, small, which qualify them: a small/large number of cases; a substantial proportion of patients; a large range of tumor markers

(2) Nominalizations expressing properties that can be quanti®ed. The quantifying use of this framework gives rise to expressions such as a speci®city of $90 \%$ , a sensitivity of $71 \%$ , an accuracy of $55 \%$ , where the collocate expresses a property and the number that follows of expresses the degree of that property.

There are a few collocates of this framework which are concerned with the description of the illness and the treatment: history, diagnosis, study, cause, result.

(10) A history of headache before the injury signi®cantly increased the likelihood of patients presenting with trauma related headache (BMJ, Radanov et al., 1993).

# 3.1.2. The framework be. . .to

Table 6 shows the twenty most frequent collocates of this framework.

These collocates of the framework be. . .to are dierent from those found to be the most frequent in the Birmingham collection (Renouf & Sinclair, 1991): able, allowed, expected, said, put, made, prepared, possible, used, unable, forced.

Table 7 lists the collocates with the highest proportion of occurrences as ®llers of the framework be . . . to.

The items which ®ll the slot within this framework are adjectives or past participles. They can be categorized into various groups:

Table 7 Proportion of occurrences of words as ®llers of the rramework \`\`be . . . to''   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Asked</td><td>95%</td><td>Required</td><td>34.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Assigned</td><td>35.57%</td><td>Expected</td><td>32.55%</td></tr><tr><td>Designed</td><td>66.66%</td><td>Considered</td><td>29.26%</td></tr><tr><td>Likely</td><td>65.57%</td><td>Similar</td><td>27%</td></tr><tr><td>Admitted</td><td>65.50%</td><td>Known</td><td>24%</td></tr><tr><td>Needed</td><td>55%</td><td>Used</td><td>21.73%</td></tr><tr><td>Thought</td><td>53%</td><td>Related</td><td>20.40%</td></tr><tr><td>Difficult</td><td>50%</td><td>Possible</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Due</td><td>41.66%</td><td>Found</td><td>14.28%</td></tr><tr><td>Unlikely</td><td>38.2%</td><td>Important</td><td>12.3%</td></tr></table></body></html>

(1) Items expressing probability, such as likely, possible, unlikely. Likely is the most common collocate of this framework. The adjective likely in this framework is usually preceded by more/less. The frequent occurrence of the pattern be likely to re¯ects one of the conventions of research papers, that of qualifying assertions in order to express tentativeness.

(2) Items expressing cause/result, such as due, related, unrelated.

(11) . . . the limitations of infarct expansion and the prevention of heart failure and death are closely related to myocardial salvage (NEJM, Sabia et al. 1992).

The verb be in these triplets tends to be modi®ed by an item expressing epistemic modality like the modal verb may (in $3 6 . 7 \%$ of the occurrences of these triplets). The adjectives due or related are sometimes modi®ed by adverbials which limit the extent to which the statement is true: may be due in part/mainly/ primarily/solely to.

(3) Items which establish a relation of similarity, such as comparable, equivalent, identical, similar.

1. (12) these results are similar to those described by Taketa et al., 24 although the sensitivity was slightly lower in our study (NEJM, Sato et al., 1993).

(4) Items expressing processes in the experimental research, such as admitted, asked, assigned, designed, required, used.

(13) . . . ®ve out of 18 $( 2 8 \% )$ injecting drug users who seroconverted reported pneumonia and all were admitted to hospital (BMJ, Mientjes et al., 1993).

The high frequency of the framework be. . .to enclosing a participle is consistent with the frequent use of passive voice in the research paper. Since these triplets (e.g., be admitted to) express a step of the experiment the verb be always occurs in past tense. These triplets occur in the Methods section. Some triplets are always followed by the same words: beadmitted to hospital; be (randomly) assigned to treatment.

(5) Items which express the cognitive process of the author and are concerned with varieties of cognition such as assumed, considered, estimated, expected, found, known.

(14) If cotinine measurements were found to be consistent with parental reports of childrens exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. . .(NEJM, Chilmonczyk et al., 1993).

As Nash (1990) remarks, when writing a paper researchers are expected to distinguish between facts and inferences. The use of this framework suppresses the self and helps to avoid the presence of personal opinions in the paper.

# 4. Conclusions

The analysis of collocational frameworks in the medical paper suggests that some frameworks are central to the phraseology of this genre. This study has given us some insights into the nature of language patterns and into the relation between phraseology and genre.

First, we have provided further evidence that discourse is prepatterned and we have shown the importance of the idiom principle (Sinclair, 1991) in the writing and interpretation of medical papers. As Sinclair puts it (Sinclair, 1991: 108): \`\`by far the majority of text is made of the occurrence of common words in common patterns, or in slight variants of those common patterns''. Medical research papers have a speci®c phraseology: some of the triplets which occur frequently in this genre are less frequent in other types of discourse. As we have seen, the top collocates of the frameworks do not always coincide with those found by Renouf and Sinclair (1991) in their analysis of collocational frameworks in Birmingham Collection of English Texts. We have also shown that the use of non-specialized lexis in scienti®c discourse implies not only the selection of speci®c senses, but also the selection of speci®c papers. For instance, we have seen that start only occurs in medical patterns in the pattern the start of. Thus, some ®llers of the frameworks analyzed occur in unique syntagmatic environments in medical papers.

The results also suggest that phraseology has an important role in what can be considered the syndrome of scienti®c discourse (Halliday, 1988), or the linguistic features that are recurrently chosen in this type of discourse. The framework the . . . of is a preferred pattern in the construction of nominalizations (e.g., the cloning of; the ecacy of ). The framework a . . . of is highly useful in the process of quantifying and categorizing. The framework be. . .to frames both lexical items which realize relational processes expressing cause or similarity (e.g., be related to, be similar to) and lexical items which realize modality (e.g., be thought to).

This analysis has also revealed that the triplets made up of the framework and its ®ller are sometimes part of longer structures and collocate with preceding or following items which belong to speci®c semantic classes (e.g.,. . .increase/decrease the frequency of . . . ). More importantly, these phrases are associated with speci®c moves or functions of the research paper. For instance, determine/estimate the number/degree of is related to the move \`\`Occupying the niche'' of the introduction.

The ®ndings of this research have potential practical applications for the teaching of English for medical purposes. Collocational frameworks can be used to present subtechnical items (e.g., cause, role, number) not on their own but together with the syntactic structures where they occur, since these frameworks help to structure the lexicon in the text. Given that some of the most typical features of scienti®c writing (e.g., nominalizations, relational processes) involve the use of grammatical frameworks, students can also improve their ability to understand and write medical papers if they are made aware of the function of these frameworks in the paper. Finally, the fact that phrases including the triplets described are lexico-grammatical realizations of speci®c moves of the paper and are used for speci®c discourse functions could also be exploited for pedagogical purposes. This could be taken into account in designing materials which provide students with formulaic patterns used in the writing of medical papers. The frameworks can be related to the realization of various text conventions and be presented as part of the generic qualities of the medical paper. The knowledge of the phraseology of the genre (i.e. the command of the semi-preconstructed phrases that occur in medical papers) will help students to understand and create meaning.
