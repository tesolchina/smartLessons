# Abstract

Several strands of research in applied linguistics have increasingly focused their attention on the application of genre theory to the classroom. In advanced academics, the genres of disciplinary communities serve gate-keeping functions that students must negotiate in order to succeed in their academic endeavors. Often without explicit instruction, students must learn to master the stylistic, rhetorical, and organizational conventions of their disciplinary communities. This problem is confounded by occluded genres—genres whose exemplars are private or confidential, and thus cannot be readily used as models. This study examines one specific occluded academic genre—the MBA Thought Essay. This study found the genre shares features in common with academic discourse and popular business management literature, but is also characterized by a high degree of structural and linguistic variation. Because the genre is occluded, authors cannot fashion their discourse on prototypical texts; rather, they appear to rely upon other genres to structure their texts. The present study presents a complex picture of occluded genres involving a number of interrelated factors: degree of occlusion, genre maturity, structural and lexico-grammatical variation, and discourse community socialization and turnover.

# 1. Introduction

Following the criticisms of process-based writing pedagogies, the 1980s witnessed the emergence of genre theory and its application to the language-learning classroom.

Although the two approaches are not mutually exclusive, genre-based pedagogies address some of the limitations of process writing by explicitly focusing on generic forms and the socio-cultural contexts that shape the writing process. Although recent approaches have made great strides in both addressing the limitations of process approaches and revealing the ‘‘invisible pedagogy,’’ little research has focused on the occluded genres of academia— genres whose exemplars ‘‘are typically hidden, ‘out of sight’ or ‘occluded’ from the public gaze by a veil of confidentiality’’ (Swales, 1996, p. 46).

As many have argued (see Bhatia, 1993; Kern, 2000; Swales, 1990; Wennerstrom, 2003), genre knowledge plays a pivotal role in advanced academic literacy. Because the language, organization, and rhetoric of academic and professional writing differ significantly from those of ‘‘everyday’’ English, it is necessary (even for native speakers) to acquire these sociolinguistic conventions. Students, if they are to succeed in their academic and professional careers, must learn to master the stylistic, rhetorical, and organizational conventions of potentially dozens of different genres. Often, however, academic genres serve gate-keeping functions to institutions of higher learning. Wennerstrom (2003, p. 124) argues that new students, who are often completely unaware of generic conventions, are nevertheless ‘‘expected to use many of these genres in order to participate in academic activities.’’ Although a critical component of academic success, genre conventions are seldom explicitly taught in university courses; rather, students are expected to acquire discipline-specific genre knowledge slowly over a period of years, through continuous exposure to genre-specific texts and an arduous process of writing and rewriting.

Fortunately, over the past 25 years, genre-based pedagogies such as those produced by English for specific purposes and the ‘‘Sydney School’’ has played an increasingly important role in writing instruction. Unfortunately, however, research in this field has tended to focus on public, easily accessible genres, such as the research article and the dissertation, to the neglect of occluded genres. Addressing this lack, the present study presents an analysis of a particular occluded classroom genre—the MBA Thought Essay. In this genre, MBA students briefly respond to a popular business quote or adage, such as ‘‘Soul, spirit, and faith are central to organizational leadership.’’ This study addressed the following research questions:

RQ 1. What are the salient linguistic, organizational, and socio-communicative features of the Thought Essay genre as embodied in genre exemplars?   
RQ 2. What are the common linguistic and organizational characteristics of poorly written essays?   
RQ 3. What are the key linguistic differences between the poor texts and the exemplar essays?

# 2. Review of related literature

With the advent of large, digital repositories of spoken and written discourse, the past two decades have yielded the emergence of corpus linguistics as an important facet in discourse analysis. Biber and his colleagues (Biber, 1988; Biber & Conrad, 2001; Biber, Conrad, Reppen, Byrd, & Helt, 2002) propose a multi-dimensional (MD) analytic approach to the investigation of register variation. In order to explain variation between registers, MD corpus linguistics utilizes a mixed-methodology approach that incorporates both the quantitative and qualitative analysis of large bodies of text. Biber and Conrad (2001) argue that a quantitative, comparative approach is necessary in order to determine the distribution of linguistic features across registers and in identifying the relative rarity or commonness of those features. In other words, they advocate a multi-dimensional approach to corpus linguistics that examines register with respect to the full range of linguistic characteristics. In addition to quantitative analysis, Biber and Conrad maintain that it is also necessary to use qualitative techniques to identify the functional foundation underlying co-occurring linguistic features. Co-occurrence patterns, they argue, must be examined in terms of social, cognitive, and situational functions.

MD corpus-based studies continue to break ground in academic discourse analysis by describing the manner in which registers vary across dimensions. Granger and Rayson (1998), for example, examined word frequency in a non-native speaker corpus of argumentative essays written by native speakers of French. Another MD study (Biber et al., 2002), in attempting to describe the challenges faced by university students, examined a number of different spoken and written registers commonly encountered in academia. Tribble (2002) has additionally demonstrated how small, specialized corpora can be used in conjunction with larger ones in understanding student texts. Most recently, Xiao and McEnery (2005) have shown how Tribble’s key word analysis captures many of the important genre characteristics revealed by the more computationally and statistically complex MD analysis.

Although corpus-based studies have flourished in recent years, several problems have become evident in those studies. Widdowson (1998) argues that corpus data lack authenticity because the text becomes separated from the socio-communicative context that created it. Swales (2002) notes the difficulty in exploiting corpus material and argues that a large amount of trial-and-error is typically involved in extrapolating anything meaningful from the data. Additionally, Swales (2002) claims that the process of corpus analysis is essentially the opposite of the top-down approach intuition would dictate. Countering these criticisms, Lynne Flowerdew (2005) argues that corpus studies which rely upon ESP and new rhetoric approaches to genre alleviate some of the limitations of corpus-only approaches. In support of this position, she demonstrates how corpora can be tagged and analyzed at larger levels of rhetorical discourse. Flowerdew (2005) also argues that corpus studies that integrate ethnography and intertextuality can help restore the communicative context.

In distinction to corpus linguistics, Swales’ (2002) approach to genres is through rhetorical structure and context. Specifically, he claims that generic texts comprise a series of moves and sub-steps, each of which serves some function in achieving the overall sociocommunicative purpose of the genre. Other studies (cf. Bhatia, 1991, 2002) echo Swales’ view of genre and genre analysis. Bhatia (1993, p. 16), for example, argues that the goal of applied genre analysis is to identify the typical discourse features of genre-specific texts in order to characterize them into ‘‘pedagogically utilizable form-function correlations.’’ Although Swales’ and Bhatia’s models of genre analysis were originally developed for academic discourse, business, and legal genres, they have found successful application in a number of different studies, including the development of pedagogic materials (e.g., Swales & Feak, 1994, 2004; Wennerstrom, 2003).

Although corpus and genre approaches to academic discourse have played important roles in shaping the contemporary pedagogical landscape, little research has been devoted to occluded genres. The few studies that address occluded academic genres include Swales’ (1996, 2004) analysis of the research article submission letter and the Ph.D. defense; Aguilar’s (2004) study of the peer seminar; and Gosden’s (2003) analysis of research article peer reviews. The present study into genre occlusion is primarily motivated by pedagogical intent and aims at the ultimate goal of providing students with explanatory exemplar models. It seeks not only to address the problems associated with the acquisition of advanced disciplinary knowledge, but to redress them as well. By examining a single occluded academic genre, studies such as the present and those mentioned above are the first step in demystifying academic discourse.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Participants

Participants were solicited from a cohort of first-year executive MBA students at a midsized US university. According to the course description, the aim of this course was to ‘‘examine contemporary organizational behavior issues and how they impact us as leaders and to develop and expand our abilities to deal with leadership dilemmas and decisions.’’ For this study, participants were asked to (a) provide digital copies of their Thought Essays and (b) complete a short biographical questionnaire. Twenty-two student participants volunteered, representing a variety of nationalities and speaking a variety of first and second languages. The age of the participants ranged from 28 to 59 years old and education level ranged from B.A./B.S. to Ph.D. In the role of genre expert, a single MBA professor was chosen according to Bhatia (1993) criteria for a specialist informant. The professor assisted in the initial identification of the target genre and participated in several informal interview sessions designed to facilitate the identification and analysis of key generic features.

# 3.2. Thought Essay

The Thought Essay is a short, reflective paper that requires students to critically expound on a business statement, quote, or adage, such as ‘‘Trust is the single most important element of social capital entrusted to organizational leaders.’’ According to the course syllabus, Thought Essays are assessed on three criteria: (a) quality of graduate level writing; (b) depth of thinking and (c) formation of questions that might further the exploration of the issues reflected by the statement. Over the course of the semester, students were required to write three of these essays on prompts provided by the instructor. For grading purposes, the professor provided students a rubric of her own design (Table 1). Although numeric grades reflect essay quality, those grades can also be influenced by a host of additional factors. In assigning grades, for example, the instructor might take into account personal issues (e.g., a death in the family), the status of the author (e.g., an L2 speaker of English), and the relative improvement an author may have made over the semester. In order to mitigate these confounding variables, the course professor was asked to additionally assess student essays according to a 3-point Likert scale. This rubric divided texts into three holistic scoring bands: genre exemplars (GE), average texts (AT), and poor texts (PT).

# 3.3. Procedure

The 57 student essays were analyzed using mixed methodologies.1 The method of genre analysis used in this investigation integrated and refined the models proposed by Bhatia (1993), Swales (1990), and Tribble (2002). Stage 1, Contextual Analysis, identified the sociocultural, contextual, and situational features of the genre. Stage 2, Linguistic Analysis, identified keywords and the lexico-grammatical and rhetorical features of the genre. Stage 3, Integrative Analysis, involved interpreting the structural and linguistic features of the text in regards to the sociocultural, situational, and contextual factors that shape the genre. After some of the sociocultural and contextual features of the genre were identified, individual essays were read several times by the researcher. After an initial list of possible genre features emerged, it was refined by consulting the professor and analyzing course readings. From this feature list, lexico-grammatical and structural codes were developed, texts were tagged, linguistic features tallied, and descriptive statistics generated. Finally, patterns in textual structure were identified and correlations between linguistic features, text assessment, and the local discourse community context were drawn.

Linguistic analysis was complemented with corpus keyword analysis. Keywords— statistically significant words that characterize a corpus of text in relation to another larger corpus—are important in that they lexically differentiate one body of text from another (Scott, 2007). The rationale behind using keyword analysis is that it can help ‘‘direct the researcher to important concepts in a text (in relation to other texts) that may help highlight the existence of types of (embedded) discourse or ideology. Examining how such keywords occur in context and which grammatical categories they appear in, and looking at their common patterns of co-occurrence should therefore be revealing’’ (Baker, 2004, p. 347). In the present study, Thought Essay micro-corpora were developed for each of the three scoring bands and for the genre as a whole. The written discourse subset of the American National Corpus 2.0 was used as a reference corpus for deriving genre keywords for the Thought Essay micro-corpora.

# 4. Findings

# 4.1. Contextual analysis

Contextual analysis entailed situating the genre in the social context in which it operates. Specifically, through consultation with the class professor and analysis of course materials, the genre was described in terms of communicative purpose, parent discourse community, participant roles, and related genres. The Thought Essay genre functions in a small, highly localized discourse community—a 10-year-old executive MBA program consisting of 7 core faculty and approximately 35 students per cohort. Because the 21-month program is designed for executives and professionals with full time careers and responsibilities, students attend classes on the weekends.

The Thought Essay genre is confined to a single first-semester course in organizational behavior that has employed this classroom genre for the past 8 years. According to the course syllabus, student writing is evaluated on graduate level writing ability and depth of thinking. Graduate level writing is defined as effective, interesting writing that is unified, logical, well organized, and coherent. Depth of thinking is defined as writing that reflects the author’s personal voice and knowledge of the topic and which is fully developed with facts, examples, and narration. A number of additional factors constrain the scope of the Thought Essay: students must write essays that respond to the provided prompt; temporal constraints are imposed on both the writer and the reader/grader; and their additional conventions for formatting and length.

In addition to the Thought Essays, students were required to write a group paper, complete homework assignments, and take three exams. Over the course of the semester students read four popular business books on organizational leadership and behavior. Concurrently, students took classes in introductory business and accounting. In these courses students were exposed to a number of different, yet related business genres including case studies, books on management and finance, as well as course lectures and discussions.

# 4.2. Lexico-grammatical analysis

Lexico-grammatical features emerged naturally from the data and included: number of words, academic, popular, and corporate reference, idioms, and pronoun usage. Following

Goonatilake and Heredia (in press), simultaneous multiple linear regression—a statistical method of modeling the relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable—was chosen as the preferred statistic because it enables multiple independent variables (i.e., text features) to account for a single dependent variable (i.e., essay score). Analysis revealed that number of words, number of references, and number of secondperson pronouns (2PP) were significant predictors of essay score. Specifically, these three factors explained approximately $58 \%$ of the variance between groups, leaving the remaining $42 \%$ unaccounted for. The ANOVA performed on this model was found to be significant at $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ .

Essay length, as expressed by number of words, was a contributing predictor of essay score. In general, the longer the essay, the better the score it received, such that $\mathrm { G E } > \mathrm { P T }$ . Exemplar essays were considerably longer than PT essays by an average of 495 words. The data also show that GE texts made more references and citations than PT essays. Quantitatively, exemplars (1.15) made nearly four times as many references as PT essays (0.31). The use of second person pronouns (you, your, yourself, and yourselves) was also found to be a significant predictor of essay score. PT essays (2.46) featured second-person pronouns slightly more than GE texts did (2.12).

# 4.3. Keyword analysis

Keywords were generated for the genre by comparing it to the reference corpus. Following Baker (2004), two cutoff points were set: $p { < } 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 1$ and percent text coverage $\geqslant 6 \%$ . As approximately $50 \%$ of the first $6 0 \mathrm { ~ k ~ }$ eywords were words that occurred in the essay prompt, these were removed from the list. The remaining 19 words that fit the criteria are presented in Table 2. Of the 19 identified keywords of the genre, 11 $( 5 8 \% )$ are nouns typically associated with business and management and reflect the ‘‘aboutness’’ of the Thought Essay genre. Of the remaining words, 4 $( 2 1 \% )$ are the first person pronouns out, I, we, and my. Rounding off the list are the conjunction and, the modals must and will, and the demonstrative this. As will be discussed below, it will be argued that these keywords, and the collocations in which they are occur, play an important role in characterizing the lexico-grammatical, structural, and contextual features of the genre.

# 4.4. Structural analysis

Structural genre analysis entails describing the ‘‘total range of textual structure available within a genre’’ (Hasan, 1984, p. 79). According to Paltridge (1997), a model of generic textual structure ‘‘must specify those elements whose presence appears obligatory to the particular genre, and those elements which appear optional for the particular genre, as well as the ordering of the elements in relation to each othery the analysis should, thus, demonstrate what elements must occur; what elements can occur; where elements must occur; where elements can occur; and how often elements can occur’’ (p. 66). In order to guide structural analysis, rhetorical moves were calculated for the introduction, body, and conclusion of the essays. Analysis revealed no categorical (i.e., obligatory) structural moves; rather, essays displayed a large degree of variation (Fig. 1). Despite this variation, some commonalities were found among essays. In the introduction, the most common moves included quoting the essay prompt, defining terminology, and taking an overt stance on the essay prompt. The body exhibited the most structural variation of all three sections. There the most frequent moves were defining terms, proffering advice to the audience/reader, and relating a personal anecdote or narrative. In conclusion, the most common moves were retaking/reasserting a stance on the essay prompt and proffering advice. Of specific concern to the present discussion are the three moves: personal anecdote, proffer advice, and take stance.

Fig. 1. Move structure by group.

# 4.4.1. Personal anecdote

Personal anecdote, a move in which the author relates a story or narrative based on personal experience, is a striking feature of the Thought Essay and one not often found in other academic genres. Characterized by a heavy use of the past tense and first person singular pronouns, personal anecdotes were found in over half of the Thought Essays. Quantitatively, the use of this move varied between GE and PT essays. Whereas at least one example of personal anecdote is found in $50 \%$ of the GE texts, only $31 \%$ of PT texts exhibit this characteristic. Moreover, the way in which GE and PT texts used personal anecdote and illustration was noticeably different. PT anecdotes were both shorter in length and less detailed than their GE counterparts. Take, for example, the following:

In my own professional career, I have been motivated to remain in positions that are difficult and time-consuming solely because of the relationships I have had with my co-workers. My direct bosses have ‘‘tended the commons’’, inspiring my loyalty to boss and company. Also, in my experience, I have worked for managers who do not ‘‘tend the commons’’. (L1)

This PT excerpt, though relating a personal experience, does so in a vague and general fashion. It is characterized by a noticeable lack of personal details. The reader is left wondering what professional career is being discussed. What type of relationship with coworkers has been so compelling? What exactly did the managers do? On the other hand, the GE essays that used personal anecdote provided much more personal detail than the PT texts. Contrast the previous example with the following:

For example, I started my time in the USAF working in the inpatient pharmacy of the base hospital where I was stationed. This particular hospital is the USAF’s largest medical facility. So, it goes without saying that it also had the most ‘‘brass’’ and arguably the highest degree of bureaucracy. (C2)

Here the author uses personal anecdote to illustrate different types of corporate culture and the personal relationships those cultures engender. While the PT author used only a few sentences to relate a personal experience, the author of this GE text continued with the anecdote for several paragraphs, comparing and contrasting a number of different corporate cultures. In sharp contrast to the PT anecdote, the personal details of this anecdote help serve as a rhetorical hook to engage the audience in the discussion.

The use of personal anecdote can be explained in part by the formal constraints on the genre and the literacy socialization promoted through primary course texts. According to the course syllabus, essays should use ‘‘narrative or argumenty [that] provides background or uses other devices to stimulate interest in the subject and provide a direction for the essay.’’ Further, essays should reflect ‘‘a writer interested and connected to the topicy [and] demonstrate a unique approach to the topic.’’ The use of personal anecdote is one means of achieving these rhetorical goals. Moreover, the use of anecdote has precedence in the primary course literature. Bolman and Deal (1997), for example, open their discussion on corporate organization by narrating the tragic story of Korean Air flight 007. Jaworski (1998), on the other hand, uses narrative to relate his personal experience with the Watergate scandal.

# 4.4.2. Proffer advice

One of the unique rhetorical features of the Thought Essay is proffering advice. Characterized by modals of necessity (e.g., must and should, and the phrasal modal need), evidence of advice proffering was found in $72 \%$ of all Thought Essays and in both the body and conclusion. Although there were slight quantitative differences in proffering advice between the two groups, there were few noticeable substantive differences. Interestingly, this move does not appear to directly serve any of the communicative purposes of the Thought Essay genre. Namely, advice proffering is not a direct reflection of graduate level writing ability, knowledge of course content, nor ‘‘depth of thinking.’ Nor does advice proffering appear to be the result of formal assessment constraints.

Rather, students seem to be following some of the rhetorical conventions found in their course readings. Course texts such as Bolman and Deal (1997), Jaworski (1998), and Wheatley (2001) all proffer advice to the aspiring or practicing business leader. Moreover, this convention enables students and their texts to project an identity of authority and leadership, as in the following excerpt:

How as leaders do we ensure that our greatest efforts are put forth into the tending of the soil to ensure that the commons are fertile? We must strive to create an environment that guarantees each individual a high degree of safety where the qualities of caring, listening, consideration, and hope are given a very high value. (S1)

In the first sentence, by using the first person plural pronoun we, the author both stakes a claim as a business leader and addresses the audience (i.e., the professor and class peers) as a social equal. As a rhetorical device, proffering advice functions in this genre as a mechanism of identity projection and social claim staking in the MBA discourse community.

# 4.4.3. Take stance

In the Thought Essay conclusion, the greatest structural difference between GE and PT texts was taking a stance—a move that entails asserting or reasserting a personal position on the original writing prompt. Whereas $7 7 \%$ of GE texts took an overt stance in the conclusion, just over half $( 5 4 \% )$ of the PT texts did. As with the other structural and lexico-grammatical characteristics of the genre, formal constraints help explain this feature. According to the course syllabus, the concluding paragraph of the Thought Essay ‘‘logically completes the development of the thesis or builds to the main point of the essay.’’ The fact that more GE authors took an overt stance in the conclusion may coincide with greater familiarity with and mastery of the five-paragraph essay, a genre commonly encountered in undergraduate academic settings. Structurally, the idealized five paragraph essay is characterized by an introductory paragraph that presents the thesis statement, three body paragraphs which provide examples or ideas that support the thesis statement, and a conclusion that summarizes the supporting points and restates the thesis. By taking a stance in the introduction and then reasserting it in the concluding paragraph, it seems probable that student authors are relying upon previously learned discourse conventions to structure their Thought Essays.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. First person singular pronouns and private verbs

Compared to other academic genres, one of the most striking features of the Thought Essay is the use of personal voice. Specifically, the genre is characterized by abundant use of first person pronouns. As revealed through keyword analysis, the pronouns our, I, we, and my were found to be statistically significant indicators of the genre. According to Biber (1988, p. 225), first person pronouns mark ego involvement in a text and ‘‘indicate an interpersonal focus and a generally involved style.’’ This feature of personal voice can be explained in part by the formal constraints on the genre. According to the course syllabus, voice plays an important role in the assessment of texts. Specifically, ‘‘writer’s thoughts, personal interpretations of issues, and personality are evident in the writing; an integrated view of the topic in the writer’s own words and style’’ [emphasis added]. Personal pronouns were a frequent feature of personal anecdote. As with many of the features of the Thought Essay genre, examples of this can be found in the primary socialization texts of the community.

Concordance lists were created by examining genre keywords. In regards to first person singular pronouns (1PSP), an identifiable pattern emerged. They were found to collocate with private verbs—a class of verbs ‘‘used for the overt expression of private attitudes, thoughts, and emotions’’ (Biber, 1988, p.105). In terms of relative frequency, the following private verbs were found to collocate (immediately) with these pronouns: believe, think, thought, find, know, feel, found, heard, and learned. The following lines illustrate some typical uses of this pattern (i.e., 1PSP $^ +$ private verb):

I believe relationships are a key ingredient to establishing order... (R2).   
I believe leaders should facilitate this process but y (K1).   
I think more emotional well being measurements should be used insteady (N3).

The private verbs believe, think, and feel were primarily used in the texts to (a) take an overt stance on the Thought Essay prompt or (b) relate a personal anecdote or narrative. Biber (1988) argues that features such as first person pronouns, second person pronouns, and private verbs—all strong characteristics of the Thought Essay—are indicators of involved, interactive, and affective production that entails ‘‘high interpersonal interaction or high expression of feelings’’ (p. 106).

# 5.2. First person plural pronouns and modals

Additional concordances were computed for first person plural pronouns (1PPP). These pronouns were found to collocate with the modals can, would, should, must, will and could. Some uses of this pattern (i.e., $1 { \mathrm { P P P } } + { \mathrm { m o d a l } } )$ are illustrated:

I would go farther and say that as leaders we should be willing to contemplate that the bottom lines should be reversedy (S1) As managers we must begin to shift away from the belief that we need to ‘‘control’’y (R2) As leaders these are the things that we need to convey through the organization. (A2)

In discourse, modals such as should, must, and need to function to mark obligation or necessity (Biber, 1988). In conjunction with the 1PPP, necessity modals serve two primary purposes in the Thought Essay genre. First, this pattern is used to proffer advice to the reader. This finding is in line with those of Flowerdew and Dudley-Evan (2002), who found the heavy use of ‘‘I think you’’ $^ +$ MODAL in their analysis of editorial letters written to journal contributors. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the use of first-person plural pronouns serves to create solidarity between the author and the audience. Take, for example, two of the most frequently occurring patterns in WordSmith cluster analysis: ‘‘we as managers’’ and ‘‘as leaders we.’’ These discourse patterns serve several rhetorical and socio-communicative functions.

First, this pattern enables the novice to stake a claim as a legitimate member of the MBA discourse community. In essence, the author conveys the notion—‘‘I am not just a student, but I am also an experienced manager and business leader. As such, you should take my advice seriously.’’ Assuming such a posture lends the essay and the author an element of authority. Second, this pattern helps convey a sense of solidarity or camaraderie with the audience. Although the scope of we and our is unclear in many examples, this pattern typically functions to tie the author with the audience (whether that be a group of peers or the professor). In sum, use of this feature serves to identify the author as a legitimate member of the larger discourse community.

# 5.3. Variation in structure

Although there were noticeable qualitative and quantitative structural differences between groups, there were also commonalities that served to characterize the genre as a whole. Of immediate note is the high degree of rhetorical variation and lack of obligatory moves in the genre. This stands in distinction to well-established genres that require almost formulaic structural organization (e.g., the research article). Why, then, do Thought Essays fail to exhibit structural obligation? A number of explanatory factors emerge; chief among them are genre flexibility, novice authors, genre nascency, and community turnover.

First, the genre itself is flexible. The Thought Essay is characterized in part by what Biber (1988) calls ‘‘involved production’’—discourse that is primarily affective and interactive in nature. Examples that score high in this dimension include face-to-face conversation, impromptu speeches, and personal letters, all discourses that exhibit a high degree of rhetorical flexibility. Because they are a type of involved production, a greater degree of structural variation is predictable in Thought Essays. Second, the authors of these essays were all novice members of the discourse community who came from a wide variety of linguistic, cultural, educational, and occupational backgrounds. Students wrote these essays in their first semester of the executive MBA program. Whereas ‘‘specialist writers seem to be fairly consistent in the way they organize their overall message in a particular genre’’ (Swales, 1990, p. 29), this does not necessarily hold true for novice writers. As scholars working in an occluded genre, students had no prior genre knowledge or experience upon which to rely when constructing their texts. Rather, students appear to have relied upon a variety of other genres as structural models for their essays.

Finally, the Thought Essay itself is a nascent, immature genre operating in a community with rapid membership turnover. The executive MBA program in which the participants were enrolled is less than 10 years old and the Thought Essay has only been used in it for the past 8 years. As a newly developing genre, the Thought Essay is experiencing a period of linguistic flux. Whereas more established genres have evolved specific lexicogrammatical and structural features to meet the communicative needs of the members of its discourse community, the Thought Essay remains a nascent genre characterized by a high degree of variation. This is in line with Swales’ (2004, p.11) observation that many academic genres are in a ‘‘state of considerable flux.’’ The structural and stylistic stability of the genre is further attenuated by the rapid churn rate in discourse community membership. Because the executive MBA program is a mere 21 months in length, every 2 years there is a complete turnover of student membership. The only stability in the community is provided by a handful of core faculty. Moreover, the Thought Essay genre is introduced in and confined to a single one-semester course in organizational behavior. Together with genre nascency, discourse community instability and membership turnover help explain the high degree of variation observed in Thought Essays.

# 6. Conclusion

The differences between exemplar essays and poor essays can be attributed to two interrelated factors: exposure and experience with academic discourse, and genre sensitivity to core disciplinary texts. Previous exposure to academic discourse provides exemplar authors a foundation upon which to frame their arguments. Because the target genre is occluded, authors cannot fashion their discourse on prototypical texts; rather, they must rely upon other genres to structure their texts. The exemplar authors in this study, for example, seemed to rely upon the five-paragraph essay. Though the five-paragraph format was not strictly followed, authors typically relied upon the overall rhetorical structure to organize their own essays. Namely, exemplar authors followed conventions of offering a thesis statement in the introduction, restating it in the conclusion, and supporting it with examples and illustrations throughout the body. Furthermore, authors relied upon the stylistic and lexico-grammatical features of academic discourse in general. For example, a common feature of academic discourse, one which is often explicitly taught in freshman composition courses, is lack of second-person pronouns (Swales & Feak, 1994). Whereas the exemplar authors typically followed this convention, the authors of poorly assessed texts used second person pronouns quite frequently.

Genre sensitivity and awareness is another contributing factor in essay quality. Namely, some students simply seem to be more aware of or more in tune with the linguistic features and rhetorical conventions that characterize the genres they encounter. Genre sensitivity helps explain why some students relied upon academic discourse to model their papers, while others failed to. It also explains why features of core disciplinary texts were evident in greater numbers in exemplar student essays. Exemplar authors used core texts as models of appropriate discourse conventions of the community; they relied upon them to structure their own arguments in ways that are socially and rhetorically acceptable to the larger discourse community.

Greater sensitivity and rapid mastery of discourse conventions enables students to move beyond their peers in staking claims as legitimate members of the discourse community. Genre awareness, then, operates in lockstep with community socialization. It facilitates the transition of novice members into full-fledge members of the discourse community. In this capacity, core texts of the community—what Gee (2002) significantly capitalizes as ‘‘Discourses’’—function as the primary vehicles of socialization and acculturation. They offer novice members examples of proper ways of ‘‘being and doing’’ as an MBA student and business executive. They provide models of ‘‘what is to be said, who is to speak, [and] how it is to be said/presented’’ (Ramanathan & Kaplan, 2000, p. 176). Moreover, they offer novices ‘‘certain values, attitudes, motivations, ways of interacting, and perspectives, all of which are more important than mere skills for successful entry into specific secondary Discourses’’ (Gee, 2002, p. 161). Core texts, along with other community discourses, function as agents of socialization and help change the novice student into a legitimate member of the business community.

Viewed as a whole, the Thought Essay emerges as nascent, highly localized, hybrid genre featuring characteristics of both academic discourse and popular business literature. As a relatively immature genre, the Thought Essay reflects a high degree of lexico-grammatical and structural variation because these features have not had time to develop a symbiotic relationship with the parent discourse community. In other words, the genre is experiencing a time of evolutionary flux as its linguistic and rhetorical features evolve to meet the socio-communicative needs of members of the discourse community. This notion aligns with Fishelov’s (1993) metaphor of genre as a biological species that evolves, mutates, spreads, and eventually declines. In much the same way that environmental pressures drive biological speciation, so do the sociocultural context and communicative needs of the discourse community drive the evolution of genre.

Moving away from the Thought Essay, this research suggests the necessity of revisiting and expanding the notion of occluded academic genre. According to Swales (1996, p. 46), these are genres that ‘‘operate to support and validate the manufacture of knowledge, directly as part of the publishing process itself, or indirectly by underpinning the academic administrative processes of hiring, promotion and departmental review.’’ They are occluded in that they are often confidential, not easily accessible, and generally hidden from public view. His partial list of these genres includes application letters, submission letters, research proposals, recommendation letters, and peer reviews. Swales (2004) envisions these genres as comprising an expanding set of rhetorical conventions that graduate students must negotiate as they move through the academic system.

The important thing to note is that genre occlusion is rarely a matter of black or white, public or occluded. Although some genres are most certainly occluded, some to the point of protection under law (e.g., genres supporting doctor–patient and lawyer–client relations), many are only partially occluded. In many cases, there exist institutionalized mechanisms by which junior members are first exposed to these genres, before having to actually produce them themselves. Before being considered to write peer reviews, for example, reviewers are required by journals require to have published in peer-reviewed journals themselves. Having had prior publication experience ensures that reviewers have had at least some exposure to the genre. Similarly for junior faculty, in writing recommendation letters for students, it is probable that they themselves received copies of the recommendations written for them when they were aspiring academics.

In addition to institutionalized mechanisms of un-occluding genres, there also exist means by which novice members can peek behind the curtains, so to speak. To cite a personal example, while writing a research proposal for outside funding, I approached senior faculty who had received funding from the same source and asked them for copies of their proposals. Likewise, students can ask other students for copies of successful papers. Teachers as well, can take it upon themselves to provide students with model papers. The fact that occluded genres can be negotiated suggests that occlusion is a matter of degree, not kind. Rather than seeing occlusion as a matter of either or, I posit a view of occluded genres in the context of the ‘normal’ or ‘default’ operations of a discourse community. That is to say, under the normal operating procedures of a community, if novice members are not typically exposed to a genre, then that genre is, for all intents and purposes, occluded.

The present study of the Thought Essay paints a complex picture of occluded genres involving a number of interrelated factors: degree of occlusion, genre maturity, variation, socialization, and turnover. From this, two hypotheses emerge. The variation hypothesis states that occluded genres will be characterized by greater lexico-grammatical and structural variation than public genres. This variation is a direct result of the private nature of occluded genres. Because the genre is ‘hidden,’ authors lack access to genre instantiations and exemplars. This lack of access, in turn, causes a critical breakdown in the genre acquisition process. Without input or exemplar models, authors must rely upon other mechanisms in order to construct their texts. Importantly, this variability can be modulated by genre maturity and community turnover. Specifically, the more nascent the genre and more rapid the membership churn rate, the greater the variability and vice versa. This condition leads directly to the hybridity hypothesis. It states that occluded genres, if they are nascent and/or operating in communities with a high membership turnover and a small stable core, are likely to be hybrid genres that embody the characteristics of multiple other genres. Operating under such conditions, new writers in the genre have no ready means of acquiring its linguistic features, nor is there time for these features to stabilize in the community. The interplay among these various factors of genre nascence, churn rate, occlusion, and variation is an important aspect of the dynamic relationship between genre and discourse community, one that warrants future attention and investigation.
