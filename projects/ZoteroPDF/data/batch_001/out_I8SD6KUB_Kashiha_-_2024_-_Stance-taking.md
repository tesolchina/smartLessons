Stance-taking

In academia, the assessment of scholarly works is conducted through diverse evaluative genres, each characterized by genre-specific linguistic features. This study adopts a corpus-assisted approach to compare how stance-taking strategies are employed in the contexts of manuscript reviews and doctoral defense sessions, with particular attention to the contributions of Iranian researchers. Following Hyland's (2005) interactional model, both datasets are examined to identify stance-taking strategies, including self-mentions, boosters, hedges, and attitude markers. The study unveils genre-specific norms in reviewers' and examiners' approaches to selfrepresentation, epistemic perspectives, and attitudinal orientations, revealing commonalities and variations in their usage. These linguistic nuances are discussed in terms of the interpersonal relationships between evaluators and their audiences, a crucial factor shaping the landscape of scholarly assessment in these genres. The findings contribute to the literature on stance and deepen our understanding of genre-specific aspects in oral and written academic evaluative contexts. Incorporating these insights into the instruction of English for research writing can assist junior researchers in effectively responding to criticisms during thesis examinations or manuscript reviews, thereby enhancing their prospects of earning recognition in their disciplinary community.

# 1. Introduction

In the realm of academic discourse, the role of criticism is a subject of nuanced discussions and diverse viewpoints. This diversity arises from the inherent nature of critique and the back-and-forth nature of scholarly discourse, where critics may express disagree. ment, offer counteraruments, or egage in constructiedialogue. On one hand, there is a prevailing belief that crticisms are esential for the refinement of ideas and the advancement of knowledge (Hyland & Jiang, 2020). They serve as catalysts for improvement, offering constructivefeedback that trengthens research endeavors. On the other hand, there exists a contrasting perspective that not all criticisms are created equal, and their assesments may vary widely in terms of rigor and fairnes. This divergence in viewpoints prompts  need for iscerning xamination of theicourse wthin aluative genres. Atthe heart of this discourse lie the question of how scholars perceive and engage with criticisms, and how evaluators, i turn, make a wide range of linguistic choices to convey their assesments. By delving into the discourse decisions made by evaluators in both written and oral contexts, this study seeks to explore how manuscript rviewers and thesis examiners take various stances to display their criticalit, and how this stance-taking is influenced by the specific type of evaluative genre they are immersed in.

Criticism involves the expression of negative comments directed at one's arguments, convictions, and actions, for which they are held accountable (Nguyen, 2008). Itis defined as "an oppositional stance (verbal or nonverbal) toward others (Kakava, 1993, p. 36) or an \*expression of a view that differs from that of the previous speaker (Sifianou, 2012, p. 1554). Criticism is inherently linked to presenting conflicting views and dissenting remarks, with its discursive role centered on creating a bridge between preceding and subsequent utterances (Locher, 2004). Previous studies on evaluative genres have ofen regarded criticism as an unfavorable communicative act (Pomerantz, 1984), which pertains to the preservation or threatening of interlocutors' voice and credible ethos (Locher, 2004; Schnurr & Chan, 2011). In academia, criticism serves as a means to assessthe researcher's knowledge, language use, and research output, contributing to the establishment of relationships betwen the critic and the recipients of criticism (Heritge, 2012). The imposition of criticism on recipients requires careful consideration, as it can, if done harshly or unfairly, potentilly threaten not only their negative face (Arundale, 2010) but also their positive face, especially when an undisputed authority is imposed upon them and their knowledge is challenged or objected to (Locher, 2004).

Despite criticism often being commonly asociated with conveying negation and opposing viewpoints, it constructive role in the development of interactional genres and the facilitation of knowledge transfer in evaluative writen and spoken contexts cannot be denied. An example of a written context is the rports that reviewers write for submissions to intenational journals. Perreviewers aim to asses the soundness and veracity of a research paper by identifying its weaknesses and criticizing various aspects of the author's claims. An example of aspoken context is the defense sessions of disertations or theses, where candidates receive a wide range of criticisms from examiners. It can be argued that manuscript reviewers and thesis examiners may employ similar or different discourse strategies to deliver genre-specific criticisms to submitting authors and candidates, who serve as the recipients of their criticism. One such discourse strategy, which motivates the current study, is the manner in which they project themselves into their evaluative discourse and take distinct stances toward the work they review or examine.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Stance in academic discourse

In recent decades, the notion of stance has been closely intertwined with concepts such as appraisal (Martin & White, 2005) evaluation (Thompson & Hunston, 2000), metadiscourse (Vande Kopple, 1985; Hyland & Tse, 2004; Hyland, 2005), and evidentiality (Chafe & Nichols, 1986). Despite the various labels used, these perspectives on stance converge on a common focus on its fundamental function, which is to demonstrate how writers or speakers step into their discourse to express epistemic evaluations and affective behaviors toward propositions. Stance is also used to enhance persuasion and objectivit, fostering interaction among interocutors, especially in academic discourse where persuasivenesand the use of impersonal language are pivotal compared to other types of discourses (Hyland & Tse, 2004). Stance is further defined by Hyland (2005, p. 176) as "a feature which refers to the ways writers present themselves and convey their judgments, opinions, and commitments. It s the ways that writrs intrude to stamp their personal authority onto their arguments or step back and disguise their involvement".

Adopting Hyland's (2005) interactional model, this study views stance as an interactive tool used by reviewers and examiners to frame their evaluative discourse. tance enables them to stamp their personal authorit onto their academic criticism, conveying both epistemic and attitudinal positions and indicating the level of commitment to their comments. Stance includes four linguistic makers.

1. Self-mentions refer to the extent to which writers/speakers choose to involve themselves in their discourse using first-person pronouns and possessive determiners (e.g., I, we, my).   
2. Hedges signify uncertainty and enable writers/speakers to refrain from fully committing to their statements (e.g, may, probably)   
3. Boosters convey certainty and assurance, strengthening the claims made by writers/speakers (e.g., in fact, must, definitely).   
4. Attitude markers reveal the writers'/speakers' attitude toward propositions by expressing attitudinal feelings of agreement, disagreement, or surprise (e.g., surprisingly, prefer, unfortunately).

# 2.2. Stance across genres

Over the past three decades, there has been a growing interes in examining expressions of stance across a wide array of written genres, including research articles (Adams & Quintana-Toledo, 2013; Auria, 2008; Hyland, 2005; Hyland & Jiang, 2016; Kafes, 2018; McGrath & Kuteea, 2012; Pole e al., 2019), reports (Crosthwate et l, 2017; Fuoli, 2017), M.A. theses and Ph.D.dissertations u, 2015), as well as students essays (Aull e l., 2017; Aull & Lancaster, 2014; Jiang, 2015). Other studies have investgated the use of stance markers in spoken genres such as lectures, seminars, and political speeches (Kashiha, 2021a, 2022a, 2022b).

Another strand of research has focused on exploring how peer reviewers take different stances when evaluating cross-disciplinary writing or submissions by native researchers compared to those who use English as an additional language. Fortanet-Gomez and Ruiz-Garrido (2010) compared the stance-taking practices of reviewers in linguistics and businessorganization. They analyzed the use of hedges, boosters, and attitude markers in feedback and compared their results with Hyland's (2005) study on published research articles in the same disciplines. They found that attitude markers were far more frequent in their corpus of reviews than in Hyland's corpus of rearch artices, while bosters were slighly more frequent. Regarding hedges, there was an equal isribution in linguistics reviews and articles, but they appeared twice as frequently in business organization artices compared to business organization reviews.

In a study focusing on stance expressions in review report for submissions to English for pecific Purposes journal, Palridge (2017) found that attitude markers had the largest share of stances in accept and minor revision reviews, whereas self-mentions were more prominent i reect and major revision reviews. He attributed the later to the reviewers high degree of personal authority in their comments. Comparing his findings with previous studies on published papers (e.g. Hyland & Jiang, 2016, 2019; McGrath & Kuteea, 2012), Paltridge noted a lower frequency of hedges in his corpus of reviews. In a subsequent study drawing on the same dataset Paltridge (2019) investigated the stance-taking practices of reviewers when assessing papers authored by both native researchers and those using English as an additional language. The distribution of tance expressions exhibited a similar pattern in both datasets, with self-mentions dominating the frequencies, ollowed by attitude markers, hedges, and boosters. These results alig with the findings of Bocanegra-Valle (2015), who reported the same frequency order.

In allhistudies on reviewers' stance-taking, Paltridge argued that reviewers employ self-mentions to demonstrate accountability for their criticisms and comments. This sense of responsibilit, especially when coupled with minimal useof mitigation, conveyed their robust expertise on the topic and helped reinforce their arguments, leaving the author in no doubt of the reviewers' authoritative position. For Hyland (2019), it is mportnt for the athors to recognize this authoritative persona beause pe revie is an interactive process tat relies on the construction of social and discursive relationships between the reviewer and the author. Reviewers manifest this relationship and asert their academic voice as disciplinary insiders through specific linguistic devices like stance.

Drawing on her own peer reviews submitted to 15 journals, Kuteeva (2022) investigated distinctive register features in acts of taking a stance. The analysis revealed divergences in register features assciated with various roles assumed by the reviewer. These divergences contributed to the establishment of a specific order of indexicality centered around the journal's authority. Kuteeva concluded that reviewers, by facilitating the discourse between the author and the journal, take a pivotal stance in upholding and, at times, challenging the authoritative status of journals. In another study, Shi (2022) loked at the rhetorical structure and linguistic features in his own review reports for 82 manuscripts submitted to 14 applied inguisti journals. Shi identified two primary sections: 'Recommendations' and Specific Evaluative Commentary' The first section consisted of several moves, including outining the content, acknowledging the need for revisions, summarizing the contributions, and articulating any major concerns. The second section presented detaled concerns, ofen formulated with care using hedges and indirect language to minimize face-threatening impact when conveying negative comments.

As for thesis examinations, very littl attention has been given to comparing this genre with other evaluative or non-evaluative genres. In a recent investigation of various oral and written event types in terms of discourse reflexivity, Mauranen (2023) specifically compared doctoral defense sessions in the Finnish system with two other genres of spoken dialogue, namely seminars and conferences. For Mauranen, iscourse reflexivity focuses on the overall communication process, rather than the use of explicit lin. guistic markers to guide the audience through the iscourse, as in the case of metadiscourse. Mauranen identified a higher discourse reflexivity rat in defense sesions, which was five times higher than in conferences and almost three times higher than in seminars The researcher attributed this to the social asymmetry and high-stakes nature of doctoral defenses in the Finnish system, where one active participant asesses the work of another, resulting in simultaneous high lels of both horizontal and vertical social distance. In another phase of the study comparing doctoral defenses with written genres, Mauranen discovered that the dialogic nature f defenes, coupled with the greater social distance between participants in comparison to written monologic genres, contribute to a higher degree of discourse reflexivity.

# 2.3. The current study

While previous studies have recognized the importance of exploring the ways in which knowledge transfer relates to communication strategies the comparisonf how criticism is perived and constructed in wrie and spoken aluatie enresthrough the use of stance has been largely overlooked in EAP research. Furthermore, only a few attempts have been made to investigate the types of critical comments provided for rearch papers and Ph.. thees writen b Iranian cholars in aplied linguistics. Therfore, this stuy seeks to address these oversights by comparing the stance-taking stategies enacted by manuscript reviewers and thesis examiners in evaluating the contributions of Iranian scholars. It endeavors to uncover both commonalities and distinctions in their evaluative approaches, focusing on how these evaluators expresstheir epistemic and atitudinal perspectives while asessing the propositions ut forth by authors and candidates.

The rationale behind comparing peer reviews and thesis examinations lies in capturing diverse evaluative perspectives. Written reviews provide insights crafed with careful consideration, whereas oral examinations demand real-time interactions, compelling examiners to swifly formulate their evaluative stance based on the unfolding discourse. It is believed that the distinct goals of reviewers and examiners in guiding authors and candidates, along with the inherent differences between writen and spoken evaluative genres, necessitat the use of genre-specific stance expressions. Such variations underscore the unique cognitive and rhetorical demands of each genre, adding complexity to the relationship between evaluators and the genres they engage with. Identifying the discourse decisions and evaluatie aroaches arising from these variations would therefore be an inriguing aspect to investigate, as reviewers and examiners may resort t similar or distinct linguistic choices and stance-taking acts to convey their fdack. Moreover, by considering the practical implications of stance-taking, the comparison addresses the real-world scenarios faced by submitting authors and Ph.D. candidates in applied linguistics. To address these research considerations, the study attempts to answer the following questions.

1. What is the frequency distribution of stance expressions in reviewers' and examiners' feedback?   
2. How do reviewers and examiners take similar or different stances to construct and convey their evaluative feedback?

# 3. Data and method

# 3.1. Corpus

The data for the study consists of two subcorpora: a written corpus of reviewers' reports on manuscript submissions and a spoken corpus of examiners feedback during doctoral defense sessions. The target audience for both gnres includes Iranian authors and Ph.D. candidates majoring in applied linguistics.

The subcorpus f reviews comprises 38 reports written on original submissions to 15 international aplied linguisics journals see Appendix), totaling 68,276 words. All reviews were written on full-length experimental/empirical reearch articles" (Swales, 1990, p. 134), which were structured in the AIMRD (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format. The manuscipts were reviewed by at least two reviewers adopting a double-blind review procedure, where the identities and affliations of both the reviewers and the submitig authors were undisclosed. Only reviews that recommended major revisions were included for analysis due to the limited availabilit f a sufficient number of other review types and the fact that reviews suggesting major revisions typically encompass more naturally occurring examples f citicism compared to those recommending actance, reection, or minor revisions. All selected reviews were written from scratch by reviewers without using any predefined checklists or templates. Moreover, they were prepared during the first round of manuscript review, which tends to include more comments on different part of a manuscript (Belcher, 2007) compared to second-round reviews. The review reports were obtained with permission from the corresponding authors. Informed consent was sought, ensuring that authors were fully informed about the study's purpose and the use of reviews. Additional information, such as the number of authors, their firs language, and the type of recommendation their paper received, was gathered directly from the authors, ensuring the confidentiality of their identities. Securing direct consent from reviewers posed logistical challenges due to the anonymity of their identites. Therefore, following a textography approach introduced by Curry and Lillis (2010), several precautions were taken to protect sensitive information and maintain the confidentiality of all individuals involved. Firstl, the collcted reviews were carefully checked to remove any personally identifiableinformation, including names, affiliations,contact details, or any specific comments that might reveal the identity of the reviewer. Secondly, review reports were stored in encrypted fle to prevent unauthorized access Finally, aes to the ollected reviews was oly retricted to the reearcher.

The subcorpus of examiners' feedback consists of comments extracted from transcriptions of 26 video-recorded Ph.D. defense sessions. The total duration of the recorded sessions is $^ { 3 9 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and $2 3 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ , with each session ranging from 67 to. $1 2 6 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ . All Ph.D. candidates were Iranian who majored in applied linguisics. The defense sesons were conducted in English at four Iranian univer. sities, with 2 internal examiners from the candidate's instition and 1 external examiner from other national institutions forming the examination commitee. Inaddition to the examiner, the canddates supervisory comitee and representatives from the university's postgraduat center were also present during the defense sessin. The selected sessons were public, similar to other local defense sessions. For consistency and parallel comparability with the review reports, only defense sesions that led to major revisions were selected for transcription and analysis, which were conducted manually by the researcher. The presentation part of the defense sessions by the candidates was excluded from the transcriptions, as the study concentrates solely on the analysis of examiners fedack during the question/answer or post-presentation part of the sessons. The resulting subcorpus amounts to 57,538 words. It should be acknowledged that 6 examiners were involved in more than one examination, which could potentialy introduce idiosyncratic effcts into their evaluative discourse. This idiosyncrasy in the spoken data was recognized and taken into account during the analysis.

Details about the candidates' education level and native language were gathered through demographic interviews and a review of their CVs. Informed consent was obtained for the use of video-recorded sessions as research data. Both candidates and examiners were provided with detailed information about the study's objectives and the potential use of the recordings before granting permission. Moreover, approval for data collection was secured from the institutions where examinations were conducted. The study adhered to institutional regulations for data protection, ensuring the confidentiality and ethical treatment of participants information throughout the study.

# 3.2. Analytical procedures

The data analysis involved several steps. Firstly, drawing on Hyland's (2005) model of stance, all lexicogrammatical devices expressing the reviewers and examiners stance were idenified and categorized. This entailed a manual analysis of both subcorpora to locate instances of tance devices used by the evaluators when providing feedack. Subsequently, each individual occurrence (token) of the identified examples was carefully exmined within its entential context to detrmine it stance-taking role and categorizit into the appropriate stance category. This step was necessary as relying solely on the surface form of an expression could be an unreliable indicator of the evaluator'stance. Therefore, a contextual analysis was conducted to understand the pragmatic impact of each occurrence. The constituent stance markers were coded, classfie, and tabulate. Descriptive statistics were then used to present the frequency of each stance type in the two subcorpora, involving the calculation and comparison of raw numbers and percentages for each type to reveal potential similarities and variations.

To ensure inter-rater reliability and precision in coding and classfying stance categories, an expert in discourse analysis was consulted. Instances where there was disagreement regarding the selection of a stance category for a specific comment were thor. oughly examined by both researchers in the context in which they were used, and discussions were held to reach a consensus. Almost perfect inter-rater reliability (0.83) was achieved using Cohen's Kappa cofficient. Furthermore since the number of texts and word count in the two dataets varied, apart from raw umbers and perentages, frequency counts were normalized toccurrences er 1000 words. This normalization process was implemented to facilitate acurate comparisons between the two subcorpora of different sizes and to present the descriptive results in a consistent and meaningful manner. Log-likelihood (LL) ratio tests (Rayson, 2008, 2013) were employed to compare the occurrences of each stance category in the two subcorpora, determining whether the diffrences were statisticall significant. Fllowing this, the log-likelihood values were subjecte to comparison against achi-squared distribution to calculate the corresponding p-value, with the significance level set at $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$

# 4. Results

During the initial phase of data analysis, it became evident that a substantial majority of comments in both reviewers' feedback $( 8 4 \% )$ and examiners' feedback $( 7 6 \% )$ were negative, indicating areas for improvement and the need for revisions. While positive comments were es prevalent, they were still present, offerig compliments or highlighting particular strengths in the researchers work. This heavily skewed distribution toward negative comments can be attributed to the selection criteria, which focused on reviews and defense sessions that recommended major revisions.

Table 1 presents the frequency results of stance expressions in the two genres. These expressions constituted a substantial portion of the discourse of ealuators, which reflets the rigidly onventionalized nature of evaluative genres compared to non-evaluative genres (e.g. Hyland, 2005; Wang & Pramoolsook, 2021). This specific nature required evaluators to assume a critical tance by stepping into their discourse and conveying varying degree f asessment toward propositions. Regarding frequency variation, reviewers exerted stance expressions more frequently compared to examiners, and this difference was found to be statisticall significant $\left( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 5 . \right)$ Moreover, the average occurrence of stance markers within each text in the two subcorpora was relatively similar, with an average of 16.3 instances per review text and 17.4 instances per thesis examination transcription.

Frequency differences were also observed in categories, with self-mentions being more frequent in examiners' feedback, while hedges, boosters, and attitude markers were more prevalenty used in reviewers feedack. Their frequency order aso varied across the two subcorpora (see Table 1). In peer reviews, boosters had the largest share of the total number of stances, followed by hedges, elf mentions, and attitude marker.In thesis examinatins, self-mentions ranked firs, followed by boosters, hedes, and atitude markers. These frequency results suggest genre-specific variations in the ways reviewers and examiners strategicall positioned themselves in discourse and assessed propositions. In the context of anonymous reviews, reviewers felt a stronger need to offer a credible repre sentation of themselves and project suitable authority and plausibilit in their verdicts by employing boosters and hedges more frequently. Furthermore, the nature of reviews recommending major revisions entailed an in-depth evaluation of the research papers making the persistent presence of reviewers as reporters potentially less significant, thus leading to reduced self-references. Conversel, thesis examinations, being real-time interactions, prompted examiners to convey a stronger impression by atributing comments to themselves, manifesting in a heavier use of slf-mentions. The interactive nature of defense sessions also diminished the need for hedges, as examiners could seek immediat clrifications through more direct expressions. The following sections present the use of each stance category, accompanied by relevant examples extracted from the two subcorpora.

# 4.1. Boosters

Boosters accounted for the most prevalent stance device in reviews and the second most frequent in thesis examinations, signaling a high level of certainty and confidence in the judgments of evaluators. Through the use of boosters, evaluators amed to underscore the unwavering nature of their assessments and convey to authors and candidates that there was no room for doubt concerning the arguments being made. Acting as a cornerstone for quality control in evaluations, boosters enabled reviewers and examinersto articulate their criticism with greater authorit, freefrom concerns about potentia chllenges or rebuttals This onfident ssertion of laims ensured that evaluators comments were unequivocal, leaving no room for doubt regarding their authoritative position and expertise in the principles f their feld. The following examples ilustrate how booster establish a stance that is challenging for the author and the candidate to contest.

(1) The bias here seriously casts into doubt the value of the findings and must be dealt with. [Review] (2) I know that this must be based on some solid evidence. [Thesis Examination]

The observed significant difference accentuates the diverse use of boosters in the two evaluative genres. In terms of conveying an authoritative tone to the audiences of criticism, it was depicted that while in reviews, the authoritative tone was mainly expressed impersonally (Ex.1), examiners were more inclined to combine a booster with a self-mention, particularly using the first-person pronoun I, to establish a robust academic voice and assert a clear authorial stance (Ex.2). This phenomenon may be attributed to the spontaneous interactions in oral fedback, where examiners often found it necessary to establish their presence and perspective by anchoring comments i their own knowledge and taking responsibility for ther asertions (Ex.3). This combination of authorial stance with epistemic evaluation could crate a strong impreson on canddates sugsting that the xaminer had confidence in their critique and expected a certain level of compliance. Therefore, personal boosters, compared to impersonal ones can beseen as claming greater authority for the examiner over the candidate.

(3) I'm quite certain that you have used both datasets wrongly. [Thesis Examination]

In peer reviews, the impersonal imposition of even an undisputed authority served a diffrent purpose for submitting authors; it acted as a means to disguise the potentiallycontentious impact of negative criticisms. This strategy is closely linked to the inherent essence of written feedback within the per review process where reviewers, conizant of the formal and structured character of ther critiques, deployed impersonal booster to convey a sense of objectivity and consensus within the disciplinary community. This approach aimed to minimize the force of their convictions and create the impression that the criticism was not simply a subjective observation but rather an every-expert opinion Inthis context, impersonal bosters functioned as a way to maintain a scholarly tone while affirming the validity and authority of the feedback provided, as illustrated in the following example.

(4) Other lecture-specific expresons serving this function must also be discussed under the theoreticl framework because they all are constitutive elements of importance marking. [Review]

Although the above comment was made assertively, it also demonstrated the reviewer's willingness to provide a supportive explanation for the criticism as a way of persuading the author(s) to consider the requested change. Another distinctive trategy in peer reviews, aimed at tempering personal imposition while booting an issue, involved linking comments to the authors by directly addressing them using the audience pronoun you' or its possessive form your' (Ex. 5), or indirectl rferring to them as The author (Ex. 6). This use of irect adress aso corresponds with the distinctive attributes of written feedback, particularly itsasynchronous nature. In this context, reviewers recognized the temporal gap between composing their citique and the author's reception of it To bridge this gap and establish a sense of engagement, direct addres was employed as a ingustic strategy to create a personalized yet formal connection with the author. This choice made their feedback fel more immediate and responsive, even in the context of written, non-simultaneous communication.

(5) Your literature review is not laid out clearly.   
(6) The author should justify why students need to comprehend topics irrelevant to their discipline.

The elevated prevalence of boosters in the review subcorpus challenges previous findings in Hyland's (2005) study on published research articles and Paltridge's (2017) research on peer reviews, where boosters were employed sparingly. Hyland (2005) justified the infrequent use of boosters in artices by emphasizing the importance for writers to exercise caution in their claims, maintain objectivity, and acknowledge voices other than their own. Paltridge (2017) attributed this disinclination in peer reviews to the reviewers decision, epecially when recommending rection in the irst round of review, to adopt a more supportive stance by avoiding "bald-on-record' (p.125) criticisms. However, the reviews examined in this study focused on providing major revision recommendations, possibly explaining the prominent use of booster as rviewers sought to encourage authors to make necessary improvements.

# 4.2. Self-mentions

Self-mentions acted as a leading stance category in thesis examinations, comprising $3 1 . 1 \%$ of the total stance expressions, while they ranked third in peer reviews, constituting $1 8 . 2 \%$ of the total stance expressions. Similar to boosters, the use of self-mentions in both genres displayed the evaluators confidence and firm convictions in expressing criticisms or emphasizing the absence of certain aspects in the research under consideration. The following examples portray how evaluators conveyed a resolute authoritative stance through the inclusion of self-mentions.

(7) I have explained that the data need to be triangulated. [Thesis Examination] (8) One of my main concerns is that I have found nowhere the definition or delimitation of this concept in the paper [Review]

As demonstrated by these examples, the act of projecting into the evaluation figures prominently in bridging the evaluators judgments and their audiences expectations. It was not surprising, therefore, to observe a substantial presence of self-rferences in conjunction with other stance markers in both datasets. By explicitly acknowledging their presence, evaluators underscored their determination when expresing certainty, uncertainty, and attitude. In particular, using personal pronouns to convey critical comments not only bolstered an authoritative persona but also helped maintain and balance the interpersonal context of the criticism. To secure this interpersonal level, reviewers ocasionally combined a negative comment with a positive one, creating a good news/bad news' scenario (Ex. 9). Through the strategic use of slf-mentions in this approach and by raising the issue subjectively, reviewers sought to soften the potential impact of their criticism on authors.

(9) Although I enjoyed reading the article, I do wish that the sample was larger and there was some quantitative analysis performed.

However, this approach was les common in thesis examinations, where the interactivity and immediate nature of the question/ answer part f the defense sessions compelled examiners to preserve transparency in their feedback and provide immediate evaluative responses. This has led to the production of les structured discourse, distinct from the conventions of the written genre exemplars being compared in ths study. The avoidance of mixing positive and negative comments in thesis examinations, therefore, represents a genre-specific adaptation to thedistinctive characteristics of oral asessments (Erwee & Perry, 2018; Johnston, 1997), allowing for a straightforward and unambiguous conveyance of critical points.

Self-mentions were predominantly realized by subject pronouns (I, we), rather than object pronouns (me, us) or possessive pronouns (my, our), with some variations between the two genres. While in reviews, slf-mentions were primarily expressed by the first person singular pronoun I, over $4 0 \%$ of total self-mentions in the examiners' comments included the collective pronoun 'we' or its possessive form our. These distinctive self-reference strategies can again mirror the subtle nuances and specific expectations within the evaluative context of the two genres. In thesis examinations, the presence of additional participants, such as the candidate's su. pervisory commitee and other examiners, might have influenced the examiners' choice to share the responsibility for evaluating candidates by attributing certain discipline-specific comments to the collective group, thereby presenting them as shared knowledge in the field $( \mathbf { E x } . 1 0 \ \& 1 1 ^ { \cdot }$ . This 'collective evaluation dynamic' was a notable feature of the assessment process in thesis examinations which was absent in independent peer reviews, where individual reviewers assessed scholarly work without specific participants. Therefore, they might have felt es compelle to use collectie language, sigaling the autonomy and impartiality expected of them and conveying a sense of individual responsibility.

(10) You know as academics we cannot throw away remarks without supporting what we said. (11) That is not prepared on the basis of what we know as common practice in test preparation. Right?

# 4.3. Hedges

Both reviewers and examiners employed hedging modals such as 'may' or 'might' to mitigate the interpersonal impact of certain comments. This served as a means of maintaining face and toning down the negativity conveyed, especially aftr delivering consecutive cathing comments. Through the use of hedges, evaluators conveyed that the work or efort of the authors and candidates was not entirelydisapprove, and their knowledge of the subject matter was respected and recognized, even amidst criticism. This was mostly accompanied by addresing the authors and candidates directly using the audience pronoun you in both datasets, while the author' only appeared in the reviews, as exemplified below.

(12) You might have overestimated the idea of correlational factor analysis. [Thesis Examination] (13) The author states that the standard deviation is high in experimental group, but mean may not provide complete detail. [Review]

Through the use of hedges, evaluators showed a tendency to take judicious stances, especiall when discussing research results. They did this by witholding full commitment to their statements and maintaining an impartial attitude toward alternative views. One plausible explanation for this practice is that reearchers typically posses more knowledge aout their own research results compared to reviewers and examiners, even if they may lack experience as academic scholars. Consequently, it was not surprising to find that the majority of hedging devices in both datasets were deployed in comments related to research results. I contrast, the use of boosters in the evaluation of the results was minimal.

The literature has recognized hedges as a crucial linguistic feature in non-evaluative genres like published research articles and books (Hyland, 2005), where they serve to moderate discourse and establish a sense of solidarity with readers. Furthermore, hedges can indicate the extent of a speaker's or writer's knowledge on a particular subject, as evidenced in the discourse of examiners and reviewers in this study.

(14) The main reason might be due to the attitudes these teachers hold towards educational trends. [Thesis Examination] (15) It may be the case that the issue of topic warrants not this single line. [Review]

In terms of their linguistic realizations, hedges in both genres were primarily expressed through modal verbs (may, might, could) adverbs (perhaps, probably, almost), and lexical verbs (guess think, asume) with epistemic meanings. However, there were variations in the use of these hedging structures. In thesis examinations, there was a strong reliance on verbs for hedging, whereas reviewers favored the use of hedging adverbs. This preference for verb-based and adverb-based hedging implies genre-specific tendencies in the choice of linguistic forms to exercise caution when making clams. Thesis examinations involved immediate dialogue between participants and thus clled for a linguisti approach that fostered clear yet tactful communication. Verbs lend themselves to this purpose, enabling examiners to convey subtle shades of evaluation while maintaining the flow of conversation. In other words, the dynamic environment of oral feedback benefitte from the immediacy offered by verb-based hedging. Peer reviews, on the other hand, offered the opportunity for a more deliberate and detached asessment proces. Hedging adverbs, with their capacity to modulate the tone of evaluative language, aligned well with the measured and composed nature of written feedback.

Another distinction was that reviewers ofen exclusively used hedges when providing suggestions for specific revisions to the manuscript, typically by addressing the author, as indicated in the following example.

(16) Perhaps, you want to do this by emphasizing the role of academic speech in the classroom context.

The inclusion of the hedging adverb perhaps in the above example signaled the reviewer's intention to soften the directness of the comment. By framing the comment a a suggestion, the reviewer downplayed their roleas an authoritative figure while acknowledging the author's contribution to the topic.

Another distinctive language pattern was the unique proclivity of examiners to combine hedges with boosters in the same comment (Ex. 17&18). This combination aimed to achieve an epistemic equilibrium, enabling examiners to assert criticisms while simultaneously maintaining a supportive and reassuring tone. This balance reflects the need for immediate engagement and a nuanced approach that harmonize citical ealuation with encouragement in thesis examinations. The concurrent use of hedges and boosters in this context allowed examiner to deliver feedback that was both rigid and supportive, fostering a constructive dialogue with candidates. This iffered from asynchronous peer reviews, where the lack of real-time interaction permitted  more measured and separate use of hedges and boosters.

(17) I assume it must be both-sided.   
(18) It should not be ignored that there might be differences between disciplinary divisions.

# 4.4. Attitude markers

Despite being the leas frequent stance device, attitude markers contributed to enhancing the evaluators authorit and control over their criticism. Both reviewers and examiners used attitudinal adjectives such as important, vitl, signficant, and crucial' to make their authoritative position noticeable to authors and candidates, implicitly drawing their atention to the importance of certain missing elements, variables,or contributions that neded to be adressed in their work (Ex 19&20). This indirect method of raising awareness also functioned as a mechanism for quality control.

(19) This is a very important variable that needs to be considered and explained in the study. [Review] (20) The contributions from different directions are vital here. [Thesis Examination]

They also employed emphatic expressions of affect, such a attitude advers insuficiently, poorly, adjectives (weak, inadequate) and verbs (regret, disagree), to raise concerns about the rhetorical and disciplinary aspects of the research under review or examination. Although the use of these expressions varied slightly between the two genres, with reviews leaning toward their usage, it is important to note that the overal occurrencef affectie reactions was not extensive. xamples of these reactions included agreement/ disagreement, surpris, and prevention. The anonymous nature of peer reviews might have motivated reviewersto display a slightly more affective persona as a means of conveying confidence in ther judgments. This ditnctivenessis further evident when considering the prevalence of praise and denigration attitude markers in the two genres. Attitude verbs, adjectives, and adverbs associated with praise were more prominent in thesis examinations (Ex. 21), comprising $3 3 \%$ of total attitude markers compared to $1 8 \%$ in reviews. Conversely, attitude markers signaling denigration occurred more frequently in reviews (Ex. 22), constituting $4 1 \%$ of total attitude markers compared to $2 6 \%$ in thesis examinations.

(21) Your work is educationally oriented, and I appreciate the use of an experimental group-control group design that you use. [Thesis Examination]   
(22) Unfortunately, I regret to state that this paper fails to provide enough detail in the methods .. The idea of 'marker of discipline' is also insufficiently developed or discussed along the paper. [Review]

Another notable difference was seen in the inclination of reviewers to uniquely pair anegative atitude marker with a booster to foreground the importance of a comment. This strategy was seldom practiced in thesis examinations. The following comments clearly communicated to the submitting authors that the quality of their research paper did not met the generally established standards or methodological norms of their field. In these instances, the attitudinal judgments expressed through the terms suitable' and incomprehensible' are directly associated with the epistemic verdicts denoting certainty (fact) or completenes (completely).

(23) The fact is that this paper is not suitable for publication in an international journal that specializes in pragmatic aspects of language.   
(24) The statistical comparative analysis provided is completely incomprehensible.

It is important to highlight that the frequency of atitude markers in the review subcorpus difers from Paltridge's (2017) research on accept and minor revision reviews, where they comprised half fall stance expressions. This discrepancy in findings may, once again, be rlatively atriute o the exclusive fus of rvies in this study on maor revisions, whers Paltidge's study ncompassed a broader range of reviews. This may have led to varied discursive decisions made by reviewers in terms of stance-taking and the expression of attitude. This is evident in the ways attitude markers were enacted in the two studies. Whil in Paltridge's accept and minor revision reviews, attitude markers mainly worked to compliment the author and highlight shared positive values, they were primarily use in major revisin reviews in this study to convey scathing or discouraging comments (Ex. 25), often featuring negative language constructions (Ex. 26).

(25) The corpus and methodology section is weak and flawed.   
(26) The results and discusson section is poor and does not significantly extend our knowledge in the field.

# 5. Discussion and conclusion

Using a corpus-assisted comparative method, this study examined the stance-taking of manuscript reviewers and thesis examiners toward their overal judgements as wellas the propositions put frth by authors and candidate. The analysis revealed that both re viewers and examiners resorted to a genre-specific norm in their critiques, showcasing both commonalities and distinctions in their approaches to stance-taking. The study emphasizes a crucial aspect - the subtle goals that guide reviewers and examiners i steering authors and candidates toward their intended interpretations. As we delve into the inherent differences between the two evaluative genres, the necessity of gere-specific stance expressions comes to the forefront. Fr example, whil peer reviews follow a double-blind review system, where the identities of both reviewers and authors are concealed, thesis examinations are conducted in person, with the presence of both examiners and candidates. The distinction between spoken and written modes is another factor that contributes to variations in stance-taking. Spoken feedback during defense sessions ofen features interactive exchanges between examiners and candidates, whereas written peer reviews rely on preplanned, asynchronous commentary. This disparit nfluences the immediacy and depth of the evaluative stance, with spoken feedback allowing for on-the-spot elaboration and clarification. In addition, spoken feedback affords examiners the opportunity to make use of not only verbal but also non-verbal cues, such as tone and intonation. This added layer of communication helps enrich the evaluative dynamic and results in real-time expressions of stance that can convey encouragement, challenge, or concern. Converel, per reviews rel solely on written language for expressing stance. The asence of non-verbal cues and the deendence on written words demand a more comprehensive and self-ontained articulation of the reviewer's stance.

Beyond a mere categorization f stance strateies, the reults beckon us to consider the uanced nature of the aluative ac itself It is evident that the expression of citical stances by evaluators is a multifaceted proces intricately linked to cultural, linguistic, and disciplinary contexts. These observed strategies, whether in the form of explicit ndorsements or subtle reevations, serve as inguistic manifestations of evaluators' engagement with scholarly contributions. Paltridge (2017; 2020) argues that this engagement is constructed through gnre-specific stance trategie. While the strategies share common ground acos oral and written asessments, the subtle variations in their usage reveal the distinctive characteristics of each genre. For instance, in oral assessments, evaluators leverage self-mentions to establish interpersonal relationships, while in written asessments, self-mentios emphasize the expertise embedded in the evaluation. Moreover, the distinct inclination toward boosters and hedges in the two forms f assments un. derscores the unique balance that evaluators navigate in expressing assurance or caution. The diverse tones of attitude markers, ranging from encouraging to critical, further aentuate this distinction and carry substantial weight in shaping the overall tone of the feedback in the two genres.

The results confirm and complement previous findings suggesting that contextual and rhetorical considerations intrinsic to written and oral genres play a pivotal rolein shaping the discourse decisions of writers and speakers (Fuoli, 2017; yland, 2005; Swales,190, Wang & Pramoolsook, 2021). However, i contrast to studies focusing on non-evaluative genres that identified hedges as having the highest density f tance xpresions (., illars & Van de Vede, 2010; Hyland, 2005; Kashiha, 2021), this study reeals a distint frequency pattern. This variation can be attributed to the unique discursive and epistemic features of the genres under crutiny. To Hyland (2005), each genre imposes specific demands on stance-taking, enabling discourse participants to rely more heavily on certan stance expressions while employing others more sparingly to suit their distinct communicative purposes. In evaluative genres, the authoritative role of evaluators as disciplinary insiders contributes to the heightened use of boosting and self-mention devices. These linguistic choices efectivel signal to audiences that the academic voice and credibilit of evaluators are acknowledged by the disciplinary community, despite the potential for ther comments to undergo discussion and counterarguments. The pervasive nature of slf-mentions not only signifies the evaluators active involvement but also raises questions about the perceived authority ascribed to their comments.

Adopting a mixed stance that combines negative criticism with awarenes-raising is necessary to inform scholars about the research-related and discipline-specific norms in their field (Xu, 2015). This amalgamation is achieved in peer reviews not only through explicit asertions on these matters but also implicitl through negative critiques of relevant sections. The most stance-laden sections of reviewed papers are the methods and design of the study, especially in terms of the choice of atitude markers. This emphasis on the methods and design of the study isperhaps due to the perception that these sections are central to constructing and disseminating disciplinary knowledge (McGrath & Kuteeva, 2012), and the evaluation of research papers relies heavily on, among other criteria, how the studies are conducted and designed. Therefore, reviewers, as experts in the field, atach great importance to these sections. Underscoring the significance of these matters through criticism can asst authors in effctively framing and writing their methodology and research design in a manner that aligns with the expectations and practices of their disciplinary community.

The study further underlines the interplay of potential biases and power dynamics embedded in the identified stance-taking strategies. As evaluators wield inguistic tools to convey fedback, a careful look unveils implicit biases that may shape the tone and content of their comments. Likewise, power dynamics between evaluators and the recipients of their citicism are reflected in the linguistic choices made, rising questions about the perceived fairness and objectivity of the evaluation process The intersection of cultural nuances and disciplinary conventions in the manifestation of stance also emerges as a focal point in this discussion. Cultural elements subtly influence the reception of evaluative language and add layers of meaning to feedback. Moreover, disciplinary expectations play a crucial role in shaping evaluators' preferences for specific discourse strategies. These observations elucidate that linguistic choices are not solely determined by generic academic norms but are entangled in a complex interplay of interpersonal and disciplinary dimensions (Hyland, 1999; Jiang, 2015; McGrath & Kuteeva, 2012).

This research posits that stance-taking practices are closely associated with the evaluators positioning style rather than the truth value of propositions. Their projection in discourse serves as a key component of expressing critical stances. This relationship aligns with the research of Paltridge (2020) and Kuteeva (2022), where the nature f evaluation and the different roles of reviewers corresponded to distinct stances. Given the highly contextual nature of stance expressions and their potential for multifunctionality (Caprario, 2022),construing their meaning in the context of criticism may pose challenges, particularly for early-carer researchers whose native language diffr from the language of the criticism they receive. Furthermore, these expressions often tend to collocate with each other to exploit new functions or stressthe importance of a proposition (Sawaki, 2014), creating added complexity in interpreting their metadiscursive implications. It is therefore beneficial to familiarize early-career researchers intending to submit their work to intenational jounals or undergo theis examinations with the gnre-specific manifestions of stance-taking in academic criticism by raising their awareness of how evaluators resort to specific discourse strategies to convey their persona, epistemic appraia, and attitude toward a disciplinary reseach project Such familiarit enables these rearchers to expand their perspectives beyond the conventional directions of thr feld and focus on its inricate rhetorical and social dynamics. AP teachers can play avital role in this process by developing teaching materials with various forms of exercises that specifically target the use of different lexicogrammatical device fr indicating certainty, mitigation, self-presentation, and afect in the context of academic and institutional criticism. Their expertise in language and their awareness of the pragmatic aspects of language use and its impact on rhetorical decisions would place EAP teachers in an appropriate position to initiate and guide such instruction.

The findings of this study not only add to the knowledge of novice researchers and students regarding stance-taking practices but also offer pedagogical insights for neophyte reviewers, thesis examiner, as well as those aspiring to engage in these evaluation roles. The genre-specific differences between manuscript reviews and thesis examinations, including aspects such as written versus spoken feedback, as well as asynchronous and anonymous evaluation versus synchronous and in-person evaluation, ntroduce a range of complexities in evaluative discourse. This sheds light on the nuanced ways in which evaluatorsarticulate their stances while providing feedback to authors and candidates. Moreover, novice reviewers and examiners should recognize that academic evaluation goes beyond mere adherence to journal and universty guidelines and checkist for peer review and thesis examination. Instead, they need to understand the rhetorical purposes of evaluation and the disciplinary sensitivities related to the expectations of their intended audience. These considerations can be incorporated into training programs aimed at instructing novice reviewers and examiners on how to epistemically and convincingly argue for their positions, project appropriate convictions, and establish thir credibility as members of the disciplinary community (Hyland, 199, 2005; Hyland & Tse, 2004; Kafes, 2018). Equipping them with these skils ensures that thir criticism is wellreasoned and constructive. Furthermore, establishing a positie rapport with the recipients of their critique can enhance the impact and receptiveness of their feedback.

Beyond the specific context of peer reviewer and thesis examiner feedback, the findings $>$ carry broader implications for scholarly communication. The identified strategies are not isolated linguistic choices; rather, they are reflective of the evolving landscape of academic discours. As scholars have grappled with understanding how language reflects critical appraal, this rearch contributes to an ongoing discussion about the interpretative dimensions f cholarly dialogue. This aligns with the broader am of discourse analysis researchers who seek to unravel the complexitie ofevaluative language acros dverse communicative sttings. One such complexity lies in the ways evaluators construct academic authority and navigate the line between criticism and guidance.

There are some limitations to the present study. Firstly, thestudy focuses exclusively on comparing the use of stance expressions in only two genres of criticism. Future investigations could broaden the scope by exploring other evaluative genres to gain a clearer account of the strtegie and tendencies for adopting judgmental and judicious stances in different evaluative contexts. For example, a comparison could be made between the criticism found in open or single-blind peer reviews and that in MA or Ph.D. thesis exami. nations to see whether knowing the identity of submitting authors and candidates can influence the stance-taking practices of reviewers and examiners. Secondly, it is essential to exercise caution when generalizing the findings to the actual research-related writing needs of Iranian scholars in applied linguistics, as this study has not examined their original research work. uture endeavors analyzing their research output may yield valuable insights into the specific writing needs of this particular group of researchers.
