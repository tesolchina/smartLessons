# ABSTRACT

This dissertation investigates second-language (L2) acquisition of whquestions by Japanese- and Chinese-speaking learners of English and attempts to specify the role of Universal Grammar (UG) in L2 acquisition.

In generative approaches to L2 acquisition, the acquisition of features (in particular, uninterpretable features) has attracted researchers’ attention. The Representational Deficit Hypothesis (RDH) (e.g., Hawkins & Hattori 2006) claims that the uninterpretable features that are not selected in learners’ L1 become inaccessible in L2 acquisition. In contrast, the Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (FRH) (e.g., Lardiere 2008, 2009) claims that reassembly or reconfiguration of features needs to occur when learners’ L1 and L2 differ in terms of feature structures, which temporarily causes difficulty. The aim of this dissertation is (i) to test these claims and (ii) to consider how Feature Selection and Feature Reassembly occur in L2 acquisition. For this purpose, I investigated the acquisition of wh-questions in English by Japanese- and Chinese-speaking learners.

English has wh-movement, while Japanese and Chinese do not. Wh-movement is driven by an uninterpretable $\mathrm { [ \boldsymbol { u } O p : ] }$ feature on wh-phrases and is constrained by strong and weak islands, as shown in (1) (Ross 1967; Chomsky 1986).

Moreover, since the $\mathrm { [ \boldsymbol { u } O p \colon ] }$ feature is on wh-phrases, their syntactic position corresponds to the scope position (i.e., matrix CP):

Japanese has the same feature but it is configured in a way different from English: The $\mathrm { [ \boldsymbol { u } O p \mathrm { : } ] }$ feature is present on the Q-head, but not on $w h$ -phrases (compare 3b with 3a).

<html><body><table><tr><td>(3) a. [Qp wh[uOp;][Np]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>English b. [NP [Np wh][Q [uOp:] Japanese</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Consequently, the Q-head alone, rather than the entire $w h$ -phrase, undergoes movement, and sensitivity to islands in Japanese wh-questions is rather selective. In contrast to these languages, Chinese lacks the feature and totally lacks movement. Although Japanese and Chinese are wh-insitu languages, wh-phrases are allowed to be optionally fronted via scrambling and topicalization respectively, which exhibit different syntactic properties from obligatory wh-movement driven by the $\mathrm { [ \boldsymbol { u } O p \colon ] }$ feature with respect to islands and scope (see Table 1 for a summary). Given this background, Japanese learners of English (JLEs) need to reconfigure the feature of wh-phrases, and Chinese learners of English (CLEs) need to select the $\mathrm { [ } u \mathrm { O p : ] }$ feature to acquire the syntax of English wh-questions.

I explored the issue of Feature Selection and Feature Reassembly through an acceptability judgment task (AJT) and an elicited production task (EPT) conducted with lower and upper intermediate JLEs/ CLEs as well as native speakers of English. Results of the AJT showed that lower proficiency JLEs/CLEs were influenced by their L1 syntax (scrambling and topicalization respectively). Furthermore, in the EPT, they produced a number of erroneous questions such as (4a) and (4b), where the syntactic position of the main wh-phrase (i.e., embedded CP) and its scope (i.e., matrix CP) diverge (see Table 2 for a summary of the results).

This suggests that the lower proficiency JLEs/CLEs front wh-phrases not by $\mathrm { [ \boldsymbol { u } O p : ] }$ -driven whmovement but by scrambling or topicalization, which are not driven by the feature and hence permit split scope. In contrast, the behaviors of upper proficiency JLEs/CLEs were similar to those of English native speakers. Thus, the results suggest that JLEs successfully reconfigure the relevant feature and CLEs successfully select it. The FRH correctly predicts the results from JLEs: Lower proficiency learners experience some difficulty in reassembling the feature, which can be eventually overcome, as results from upper proficiency learners have shown. In contrast, the RDH fails to explain the results from upper proficiency CLEs, whose behaviors are patterned after native speakers of English.

Based on the results obtained, I considered from a perspective of Generative Grammar why Feature Selection and Feature Reassembly are possible in L2 acquisition even in the poverty-of-the-stimulus situation. Universal Grammar (UG) dictates that obligatory syntactic Move be followed by Agree of an uninterpretable feature (e.g., Chomsky 2013). Putting it differently, the acquisition of an obligatory syntactic Move (even if it is not a target-like kind of movement) automatically leads to the acquisition of the relevant uninterpretable feature by virtue of a deduction from UG. The AJT results suggest that the JLEs and CLEs apply scrambling and topicalization respectively, and the lack of production of whin-situ questions suggests that they apply these operations obligatorily to form wh-questions. Based on these observations, I propose that the learners’ assumption that otherwise optional operations such as scrambling or topicalization must be obligatorily applied in forming English wh-questions triggers the acquisition (more specifically, selection or reassembly) of the $\mathrm { [ \boldsymbol { u } O p \mathrm { : } ] }$ feature by virtue of the deduction from UG. On this view, UG functions as a corrective mechanism in L2 acquisition, where an inconsistency (i.e., obligatory application of otherwise optional operations) that arises in interlanguage in the course of development is removed in conformity with UG (cf. Sharwood-Smith 1988).
