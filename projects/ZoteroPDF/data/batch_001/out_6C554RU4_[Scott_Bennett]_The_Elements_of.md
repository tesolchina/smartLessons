# Introduction: Writers Make Choices

The content of your résumé, cover letters, and other pre-interview documents is really a series of choices. This guide will provide you with an employer’s perspective so you can make informed choices. Apply this new knowledge and you will avoid common errors, create maximum impact, and generate more responses than ever before. The choices you make as you write are crucial to generating responses. But there’s more going on here.

# Why Sometimes You Can Do Everything Right and Still Get No Invitation to an Interview

An error-free, clear, focused, and targeted résumé and cover letter may yield no interview for many reasons.\* Here are eight:

1. As bizarre as it may sound, many organizations advertise openings already filled. Advertising such “pre-wired” jobs seems silly, but policies, contracts, or regulations often require it.

2. Some less-than-scrupulous headhunters trawl for résumés by placing an ad even when no specific position really exists, hoping to attract candidates for potential employer-clients.   
3. Sudden changes (reorganizations, budget cuts, hiring freezes, or layoffs, for example) remove the need to fill an advertised opening.   
4. Inefficient organizations of all sizes may take months to move from placing an ad to contacting applicants.   
5. Mismatch. An employer receives enough responses from other candidates whose skills and experience are more closely suited to a specific position.   
6. Timing. A well-targeted inquiry reaches an organization with suitable positions but no current openings.   
7. Employer idiosyncrasies. The varied preferences of decision makers mean that the most talented candidate doesn’t always prevail. For example, some hiring managers reject all graduates from certain schools. Decca Record Company rejected the Beatles in 1962 and declared, “We don’t like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.”   
8. Lack of civility often accounts for the absence of any response (e.g., an invitation to interview or a courtesy letter, card, or email message).

Notice something in common about all these situations? The absence of an invitation to interview in such situations has absolutely nothing to do with you or your résumé or cover letter. These situations are beyond your control. Remember this, or you will mistakenly blame your résumé or cover letter or yourself for the absence of a desired response when none of these is at fault.

# Pay Attention to Items Within Your Control

The trick to writing a winning résumé and cover letter is focusing carefully on the many items you can control.

Choose to use the tips in this guide and I believe you will increase the number of responses you receive from prospective employers. Here’s why: Your compelling résumé and cover letter sent to carefully targeted readers will convey a lot about you even before any response phone call or in-person interview takes place. For example:

• You can organize data and thoughts.   
• You can present complex information concisely.   
You pay attention to detail.   
You communicate in a clear and focused way.   
You are enthusiastic.   
You have useful skills.

In many ways, your résumé and cover letter are the “paper interview,” and only by winning the paper interview do you have a chance at an in-person one.

# Less Is More

Whenever you hear someone say, “to make a long story short,” do you ever get the feeling it’s too late? That ship has sailed. Again, writers make choices. I am going to encourage you repeatedly to choose your words carefully. The ability to “write short” is respected by most readers, including employers. No one is hired simply to read cover letters and résumés. Everyone who reads them has plenty of other work to do, too. If you’re lucky, your documents will get eight to ten seconds of the reader’s eyeball time. Direct those eyeballs carefully and use your precious few seconds of attention wisely. Respect the reader’s time and you’ll be ahead of most candidates.

Your résumé is not intended to list every task you performed at every position. Employers know this. I repeat: employers know this. It is a top-line, highlights kind of document intended to quickly give readers an honest sense of your skills, where you’ve been, and where you’re going. It’s not an autobiography. The art of the résumé is to briefly and clearly convey one’s expertise and evoke enough enthusiasm from readers to get them to respond. If your résumé gets your phone to ring, it has done its job well.

# Twelve Things You Can Do Without

1. Don’t make stuff up. Embellishing or exaggerating the facts is the same as lying. When you don’t do this, you can never get caught and you can feel better when your head hits the pillow at night.

2. Avoid automated résumé templates (i.e., “wizards” or other doit-yourself and fill-in-the-blanks software). Résumés created using templates look like résumés created using templates. Your résumé is too important. These free or cheap tools are no replacement for time and thought. Remember: employers read many résumés. Identical formats are obvious. Different candidates will quite naturally have different résumé sections: Volunteer Experience, Language Skills, Memberships, Field Placements/Internships, and many others.

3. Avoid multiple résumés. Employers want from your résumé what you would want if you were an employer: some clear sense of where you’ve been, what you’ve done (this reveals your skills), and where you’re going. One résumé provides this. Writing a different résumé for each prospective employer to “keep your options open” is a misery-making enterprise, and employers can detect the lack of direction it represents. Instead, investigate career paths of interest to you (see pp. 3–4 for ideas on how to do this) and focus on one before writing.

4. Don’t load your résumé with jargon or buzzwords. Hoping their résumés will get electronically “scanned” for “key words,” some candidates insert a lot of specialized lingo. If any reader—an entry-level human resources person or any other reader who appreciates clarity—cannot understand your words, then your résumé will not evoke the responses you seek. Electronic scanners capture plenty of relevant data from résumés that are clear and accurate rather than packed with jargon. Use no mumbo jumbo.

5. If English is not your area of expertise, don’t wing it. If you don’t have it already, buy and read the latest edition of The Elements of Style by Strunk and White (only 105 pages and around eight bucks) before you write. Really!   
6. Don’t count on your spell-check. Spell-check is not an editor: form vs. from escapes spell-check, as does their vs. there vs. they’re, among countless other such examples. If one mistakenly types copletion instead of completion, several versions of Microsoft Word will suggest replacing it with copulation instead of completion. Use a dictionary.   
7. Don’t skip the step of proofreading your finished product. In addition to rereading your documents from start to finish to check for clarity, also read them backwards to catch typos. This will slow your reading and allow you to focus on each word.   
8. Don’t overlook having other qualified people review your finished product. Have your documents reviewed by at least two other people (a) who routinely hire people as part of their work and (b) whose writing skills and candor you respect. Here’s the hard part: listen to what they have to say. As writers, sometimes we have to delete cherished words and phrases to create the clearest, most focused documents. It often takes another qualified set of eyeballs to see what needs to be done in this regard.   
9. Reject free “critiques” from résumé sellers. A critique from

someone whose livelihood depends on converting the critique into a résumé sale is not the kind of critique you need. Stick

with reviewers who meet the criteria in item 8.   
10. Don’t broadcast (“blast”) or post your résumé on the Web unless you are comfortable with (a) your co-workers or employers seeing it, (b) headhunters using it without your permission, and (c) format or content errors being sent everywhere.   
11. Don’t send your documents to prospective employers until you have a working answering machine or voice-mail service on every phone number that appears on your documents. Hoping that employers will call you only when you’re home is folly.   
12. Don’t leave a silly outgoing message on your answering machine or voice mail. If you have such a message, change it to a brief, serious, audible, and clear one (without music) before you send your documents to prospective employers. Being taken seriously is crucial to your successful search.

Mindful of the foregoing, let’s now address the common concerns that often—but need not—get in the way of creating an error-free, clear, focused, and targeted résumé.

Elements   
  
Résumé   
Style

# Common Concerns

“Everyone I know has a big ‘but.’” —PEE-WEE HERMAN, “PEE-WEE’S BIG ADVENTURE”

If you break into a cold sweat, get woozy, or just feel a little uneasy when you think about writing your résumé, then rest assured: (1) you are not alone, and (2) there is hope. Here are common concerns and guidance on each.

# Are You Sure of Where You Want to Work?

Many candidates for whom the answer to this question is “no” will mistakenly send responses, inquiries, and résumés scattershot, with no clear plan. Such mailings are a waste of time because employers can detect mass mailings, broadcast faxes, and junk e-mail (spam) just as easily as the rest of us can.

You will receive few or no responses even with an error-free, clear résumé if you send it to the wrong places. Sending an otherwise excellent but poorly targeted résumé is like sending an expensive box of handmade chocolates to people with diabetes who cannot eat sweets. Effective targeting increases the response rate.

Identify and evaluate targets before you send your résumé. Ideas are all around you. Talk to friends and family members. Look at the categories from A to Z in the yellow (and blue) pages. Read ads—not only the Help Wanted ads—in daily and weekly newspapers. Leaf through the ads in the magazines you read. Listen to ads on your favorite radio stations. See ads on television. Use the Internet.\*

For example, go to click4careercoaching.com and click on “Learn about Your Next Employer” and “Use My Great Job Links and Job Hotlines.” You can use the free resources there to learn more about employers in whom you’re already interested, discover new ones, and see if any are suitable targets for an inquiry letter and résumé. Doing groundwork such as this avoids the low response rates associated with inadequate targeting.

Once you have identified organizations where you might want to work, forget about whether they are hiring. Learn more about them, and if you see a potential fit (i.e., if you believe your skills and enthusiasm can add value), then send them a thoughtfully prepared inquiry letter (see pp. 63–66, 67–68) and résumé tout de suite.

When examining potential targets, evaluate the cultural aspects of each prospective employer. Different organizations are at different stages of existence. Consider the excitement of helping launch a startup versus the relative stability of working in an established enterprise. Which setting do you prefer?

Similarly, the size of an organization has a big impact on the level of financial and human resources, as well as the level of structure in place. Would you rather work in a small company without bureaucracy but with few resources? Conversely, are you willing to tolerate some red tape to have more resources in place?

The operating principles of an organization permeate every aspect of work life in that organization. For example, the shared ownership of a clear mission, responsibility with authority, an unambiguous reporting structure, an environment of mutual respect, innovation, integrity at the top, and other factors impact heavily on job satisfaction.

The style of an organization impacts work life, too. Dress code, work schedule, and perks (from pizza and Ping-Pong to cars, jets, and expense accounts) help shape our view of the workday and reveal a lot about an organization’s view of the work ethic.

Gain insights into these and other issues from newspaper, magazine, trade journal, and Web articles, radio and television news reports, Internet message boards, employer home pages, and knowledgeable friends and family members. Doing so will allow you to make an informed selection of targets for your inquiry letter and résumé.

Well-targeted inquiry letters are so powerful that some candidates don’t bother with response letters at all! These people do their reconnaissance, decide where they want to work, then methodically fax, email, mail (snail-mail), and hand-deliver an inquiry letter and résumé to each target and call judiciously—not too often—to follow up until they’re hired by one of the targets.

# Are You Sure of What You Want to Do?

Web tools,\* books, assessment instruments (e.g., Self-Directed Search, Strong Interest Inventory, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), and other items exist to provide food for thought but not answers. View all results as suggestions, ideas, and examples—and nothing more. Only you can choose the best path for you.

Many people hesitate to choose and focus on a specific career path because they fear they may make a wrong decision. If you feel this way, be gentle with yourself. Gather information, make the most informed decision you can, then support your own decision by pursuing it with vigor. Focus on it like a laser beam.

Learn the requirements for entering the field. Are you willing to meet those requirements? If not, move on. If so, do everything in your power to make it happen. Make the time. Ask your loved ones for understanding and support. Get the training. Apply for the student loans. Earn the certification. Pass the exams. Get the license. Find successful organizations where you can pursue your chosen path and enthusiastically target them with inquiry letters and résumés. In short, be an active seeker.

# What if I begin working in a new career and the quality of my work isn’t very good?

When we start something new, we’re not supposed to be very good at it. Babies typically fall down when they first attempt to walk. We view this as normal and natural. A healthy parent praises the baby’s attempts and encourages more. However, when as adults we stumble just as naturally to learn new things, we can be so very unkind to ourselves. It doesn’t have to be this way. When you stumble on your new path, do a little self-parenting. Praise your efforts. Encourage yourself. And keep trying. In this spirit, the late British author Gilbert Chesterton wrote, “A thing worth doing is worth doing poorly.”

# What if one day I discover the choice I made is not the ideal path for me?

There is no such thing as an ideal path. We can only make the most informed choices we can make. Over time, as we establish ourselves in a new career, we naturally continue to weigh the positives and negatives of our choices, and if there is enough good stuff, we advance along the current path. If not, we investigate new paths. If instead you are frozen in place while waiting to make the perfect choice, then consider the old saying, “Perfect can be the enemy of good enough.”

Any career you choose is likely not the last career you will have between now and your demise. Lighten up. Give it your best shot, and if one day you choose to change paths, congratulate yourself on your efforts, the added experience and knowledge, and move on to the next adventure.

# Résumé Length

Anyone who tells you there is one hard-and-fast rule on résumé length is making it up. For obvious reasons, there is a bias among hiring managers in favor of a brief, clear, and compelling document. But this can take many forms. Many people with twenty years’ work experience have a successful one-page résumé. Some people with ten years’ work experience require $1 \%$ pages to pitch their skills most effectively. The length of your résumé depends on the nature and number of positions you have held during your unique work life.

Do you need hard-and-fast rules to follow? Here are seven:

1. As you read each word you’ve written, ask yourself: Does this word contribute most efficiently to the pitch? In order to save space, you may have to replace an otherwise fine word with an equally suitable shorter one. For example, reduce $\Rightarrow$ cut, instruct $\Rightarrow$ train, abolish $\Rightarrow$ end, television $\Rightarrow$ TV, scrutinize $\Rightarrow$ examine, information $\Rightarrow$ data. You get the idea.   
2. As you read each action statement you’ve written, ask yourself: Is this information needed to make an effective pitch?   
3. If the information is needed, is there a way to convey it at least as clearly using fewer words?   
4. As you look at the latest draft of your résumé, ask yourself: Am I using my eight to ten seconds of each reader’s attention in the most efficient way?   
5. Beware of the old adage, “Material fills the available space.” If you genuinely require part of a second page, do not interpret the blank space on page 2 as an invitation to “spread out” and write more all over your document.   
6. If you require part or all of a second page, resist the urge to include a lengthy “header” (e.g., “page 2, résumé of Scott A. Bennett continued”). Instead, a simple header or footer with only your last name and the numeral 2 (e.g., Bennett/2) will do, if you choose to use one at all. None is needed.

7. Do not staple pages. Stapled pages make copying more difficult for recipients and the copied pages less attractive to readers.

Some candidates mistakenly believe brevity is really only for entrylevel candidates. Without exception, the most effective communicators (including—it’s no coincidence—most senior-level candidates) tend to create brief résumés. The ability to communicate effectively is prized by every employer. Show employers you possess this skill by “writing short.” Candidates who “write long” reveal (1) an inability to organize and convey complex information quickly and (2) disrespect for the reader’s time.

A résumé is not a curriculum vitae (CV). A CV is generally used by academics and tends to be longer than a résumé. It includes more detailed chronologies of presentations, publications, field, teaching, and research experiences and more, and can run many pages. Such length and detail is inappropriate for a résumé. By applying the tips in this guide, anyone wishing to do so can convert a CV into a clear, focused, and compelling résumé.

# Chronological or Functional Résumé?

Use reverse-chronological (newest to oldest) format. Most employers prefer it because it’s more direct and easier to read. Plus, employers are already in on the much-touted “secret”: functional (nonchronological) résumés are used to disguise a work history the candidate thinks needs disguising. Is this a message you want to send?

Use reverse-chronological format for any sections with chronological entries (e.g., Work Experience; Field Placements/Internships; Volunteer Experience; Education; Inventions, Published Works, Seminars).

# Employment Gaps

Real people often have gaps in their work histories. Don’t hide gaps by extending exit dates or pushing up start dates on your résumé. People get laid off or fired. We care for children or other loved ones. We recover from illnesses, traumas, or injuries. We serve time for crimes. We go to school. We do countless other things as we move through life. All such gaps can be explained in an interview. If a hiring manager reads the résumé of an obviously skilled person with a lengthy gap, he or she will simply ask the candidate about it, not burn the résumé. Be kind to yourself on this point, and focus on clearly showing (through position descriptions, volunteer experience, software skills, language skills, etc.) the transferable skills you can bring to your next employer.

Re-entry after an extended gap is achievable. If you can keep up with relevant trade journals or take continuing education courses during the gap, great. It’s not required, though. If, for example, while working in purchasing you were able to establish vendor relationships once (or, say, working in public relations you were able to establish media relationships once), remember: you obviously have the skills to do it again.

A few recruiters insist that gaps are unacceptable. These few are not among the smartest in their field. Being ruled out for a position on the basis of a gap is a useful warning. You wouldn’t want to work for them, anyway.

# Include Interim Jobs?

A vice-president laid off from a manufacturing firm tends bar while looking for a suitable new position. A marketing director fired from a media company cleans houses while he searches for another marketing position. A controller whose Internet firm closed takes bookkeeping assignments from a temp agency until she finds her next permanent job. Should these interim jobs be part of their résumés?

This is a decision each candidate must make.\* If positions you view as interim jobs are included on your résumé, some readers will respect your work ethic and honesty. Some may exploit the information by offering a lower salary. Still others may do both.

Don’t assume the worst, however. Let’s say the salary range in your area for the position you seek is $\$ 60,000$ . It is the rare hiring manager who will ignore the range and try to get your services for $\$ 40,000$ just because he or she estimates you’re earning half that much at an interim job. Yes, private-sector employers (except nonprofits, which often can’t afford to pay as much, anyway) exist to maximize profits, and this includes cutting costs, but they must also compete in the marketplace to attract and retain qualified staff. Getting you for a few months “on the cheap,” then quickly losing you to another better-paying employer is no bargain.

If you decide to omit interim jobs from your résumé, then adhere to the spirit of truth-in-advertising: Change the Work Experience section heading to Relevant Work Experience.

# Self-Employment

Include self-employment as you would include any other position. Do not make up inflated titles like “Chief Executive Officer” or “Chairman of the Board” for your role in a solo operation.

5/96–present Self-employed, Metropolis, NY Freelance Writer and Lecturer   
[3- to 6-sentence position description/blurb here…]   
[Strike TAB key after present on first line and at beginning of second   
line.]

Many former entrepreneurs mistakenly fear that prospective employers will view them as (1) unwilling or unable to report to others and (2) failures. The first of these fears is groundless and the second is impossible. First, former entrepreneurs have been where the buck stops. They understand—perhaps more clearly than other employees—the need to quickly pitch in and get something done without endless debate. Second, while a business can be a failure, a person cannot be a failure. People don’t turn into goats after a business fails. They’re still successes as people.

The accomplishments of entrepreneurs (especially the lessons learned) add value to their candidacies. Such candidates are usually (by necessity) excellent multitaskers and proficient at managing limited resources. Most employers also recognize the determination and intensity required to launch any enterprise.

# Job Hopping

Why do candidates who perceive themselves as job hoppers seek résumé-writing advice? What’s the one thing we know for sure about job hoppers, even before we meet them? They are already clever at getting jobs. Perhaps they are falsifying or omitting start and exit dates or using a nonchronological résumé format in an attempt to camouflage reality. Some may present real dates on a reverse-chronological format. All are convincing explainers.

Although few agree on a precise definition for “job hopper,” if you view yourself as one, then employers may, too. However, a couple of hops does not a bunny make. If, for example, after one year in a job you were laid off, then worked six months, then left to care for a loved one who suddenly fell ill, this is not hopping. Hopping is a continuing pattern over many years.

Even such patterns are increasingly accepted in many fields, especially if you added value at each organization and learned new skills or lessons from each experience. Interestingly, more and more candidates find it helpful to think of themselves like ballplayers or coaches, adding value and then moving from place to place within one career path or industry as the market dictates.

If over many years you hop from job to job, dissatisfied and with no obvious game plan, you can choose now to shift from disguising reality to improving it. Listen to the message your job hopping may be sending you and choose to act on it:

• Do you need to explore organizations and career paths with requirements more closely suited to your skills, interests, and values? If so, turn to pages 1–4 for ideas on how to do this. • Do you leave jobs in anger? If so, buy and read How to Control Your Anger Before It Controls You by Albert Ellis and Raymond Chip Tafrate (New York: Citadel Press, 1997).

Next, we’ll look beyond words and phrases to the nonobvious yet powerful presentation elements of a winning résumé.

# Presentation: The Reader Sees More than Words

Just as your unspoken communications (e.g., facial expressions, wardrobe) often set the tone for your spoken words and deeply affect how those words are received, there are a number of elements beyond the words in your résumé that set the tone for your written words and have great impact on the reader’s level of interest and attention. Here they are.

# Paper

So many candidates use nonwhite paper these days that you will probably attract more attention with white paper. If you can afford it, fluorescent white 24-pound 100 percent cotton is ideal (e.g., search for item number 20288 at www.crane.com). If not, regular bright white 24- pound bond will suffice. The choice you make here is a lot like the modest investment that home sellers make to improve the curb appeal of their home—such an investment is usually money well spent.

# Ink

Print your résumé in black, the most suitable color for those and other pre-interview documents. If you use inks other than black, you risk not being taken seriously by employers.

Unfortunately, each time you type an e-mail address, many versions of Microsoft Word (and some other word processing software) automatically underline it and change its color from black to blue. The result inappropriately draws the reader’s attention away from your name, the most important item at the top of each document. Thus, it is important to remove both the underline and the blue type from your e-mail address on each document. (You need to do this even if you have only a black-and-white printer, because when you attach your documents to an e-mail message—more on this later—the recipient will see that underline and blue print.) Here’s how to do that:

1. Block (SHIFT- $\Rightarrow$ ) the e-mail address.   
2. Go to Format and select Font.   
3. Select Underline: (none).   
4. Select Color: Black.   
5. Click OK.   
6. Click $\Downarrow$ to unblock text.

# Margins

Set all margins (left and right, top and bottom) to 1 inch. Resist the temptation to make the margins smaller than this in order to cram more text onto a page. Instead, use fewer words and choose each word carefully. Maintaining 1 inch margins will help your résumé stand out from the stack.

# Spacing

After each sentence, strike the space bar only once. Some people strike it twice, and over the course of a page, this wastes a lot of valuable space.

Use tabs for uniform appearance. For example:

<html><body><table><tr><td>1/99-1/02</td><td>Big Giant Company, Inc., Metropolis, NY</td></tr><tr><td>12/00-1/02</td><td>Director, Client Service</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[3- to 6-sentence position description/blurb here...]</td></tr><tr><td>6/00-12/00</td><td>Client Service Supervisor</td></tr><tr><td>1/99-6/00</td><td>Client Service Representative</td></tr></table></body></html>

After the date and before the name of the employer, strike the TAB key, not multiple spaces. The same applies between each end date and job title. Doing so will avoid your having to play with the space bar in the hopes of eventually lining up text evenly.

If you find your text flowing onto a second page by only a few lines, here are two ways you can create extra space on the first page instead:

1. Take advantage of an optical illusion: an 8-point blank line looks a lot like the space of a regular text line. Thus, change every blank line on page 1 to 8-point type. For each blank line (each line with no text), move the cursor to the beginning of the line, SHIFT- $\Rightarrow$ , then change the font size to 8 point. After doing this for all the blank lines, you may see your overflow text pop back onto page 1.

2. Adjust the space between characters. This is called “kerning.” Here is an example:

Use kerning if and only if there is slight spillover to a second page. [normal kerning]   
Use kerning if and only if there is slight spillover to a second page. [kerning condensed 0.2 point]

See the difference? It may seem minor, but over an entire document, the space savings are considerable. Here’s how to do it:

1. Move the cursor to the beginning of your document.   
2. Block (SHIFT- $\Downarrow$ ) all text.   
3. Click on Format and select Font.   
4. Select Character Spacing.   
5. Under Spacing, select Condense and select By 0.2 point.   
6. Click OK.   
7. Click $\Downarrow$ to unblock text.

If you use kerning, (1) use it for the entire document, not just select words or phrases, and (2) condense by no more than 0.2 point or the result will look ridiculous. Really it will.

Type the sections directly below their headings. Some candidates mistakenly waste one-third of the page by typing all the content to the right of each heading:

Work Experience 1/99–1/02 Big Giant Company, Metropolis, NY 12/00–1/02 Director, Client Service [3- to 6-sentence position description/blurb here…] 6/00–12/00 Client Service Supervisor 1/99–6/00 Client Service Representative

This is a waste of space. Instead, stick with the following:

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Work Experience</td></tr><tr><td>1/99-1/02</td><td>Big Giant Company, Inc., Metropolis, NY.</td></tr><tr><td>12/00-1/02</td><td>Director, Client Service.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[3- to 6-sentence position description/blurb here...]</td></tr><tr><td>6/00-12/00</td><td>Client Service Supervisor</td></tr><tr><td>1/99-6/00</td><td>Client Service Representative</td></tr></table></body></html>

Although the first example may appear to use less space than the second example, it actually uses more once the position descriptions/blurbs are in place. The suggested format (the second example) uses space much more efficiently and still leaves plenty of room on both sides for readers to scribble comments or questions.

# Font

Select a serif font (like Times New Roman) for your documents. Research conducted by many print advertising experts has proved such fonts are easier for readers to understand\* and thus generate more responses than sans-serif (flat) fonts. It is tempting to play “fun with fonts,” but instead stick with what is proven to work.

$\circledast$ What if the Hokey-Pokey really is what it’s all about? [Arial, a sans-serif font, proven to generate fewer responses] $\circledast$ What if the Hokey-Pokey really is what it’s all about? [Univers, a sans-serif font, proven to generate fewer responses] $\circleddot$ What if the Hokey-Pokey really is what it’s all about? [Times New Roman, a serif font, proven to generate more responses]

Playing “Fun with Fonts”

Some folks mistakenly think that using bullets, lots of different fonts, bold, italics, ALL CAPS, underlining, and silly combinations of THESE will get a reader’s attention. The truth is, when we accentuate everything (or too much), we accentuate nothing. Candidates often ask, “If I don’t use these tricks, what will get their attention?” Your content (i.e., your properly positioned examples of transferable skills) will get their attention. Content sells.

# Font Size

Use no more than two font sizes to avoid a carnival-like, disorganized appearance. Use one size for your name (16 or 18 point), and another for the rest (11 or 12 point).

Resist the temptation to use smaller font sizes in order to cram more text onto a page. Again, instead use fewer words and choose each word carefully.

# Boldface

Apply boldface only to your name and the section headings. This will provide readers with an easy path through your information. Resist the temptation to apply boldface to anything else.

# Italics

Use italics only for the names of publications (e.g., The New Yorker) and foreign phrases, if any (e.g., cum laude to express “with honors”).

# All Caps

Don't use ALL CAPS on your résumé. They serve no constructive purpose, and many readers interpret their use as rude (i.e., the written equivalent of shouting).

# Underlining

Don’t use underlining on your résumé. Like ALL CAPS, underlining draws the reader's eyes away from parts of your résumé. Is there any part of your résumé from which you want the reader to look away?

Now that you have the tools you need to help you set the tone for your words, we'll explore how even items as simple as contact information send messages to the reader.

# Even the Simplest Items Send Messages to the Reader

Like in many realms of life, little things mean a lot on your résumé, too.

# Your Name

If your name ends in “Jr.” or “II” or “III” or “IV” and so on, you may choose to omit such designation from your résumé. When these designations are used, readers may perceive you as defining yourself largely in terms of your relationship to someone else, and this may be viewed less favorably in the United States than in other countries. If you share a phone number with another person whose identity is frequently confused with yours, you’re in a tough spot and you may have to include the designation. Avoid it if you can.

Do not attempt to disguise your gender or ethnicity (or the appearance of a particular ethnicity) by using initials instead of names. However, if you are really called by your initials, then place them in quotes and in parentheses:

# Julio (“J.T.”) Bennett

Omit academic degrees (e.g., AA, AS, BA, BFA, BS, DDS, DO, DVM, EdD, JD, MA, MBA, MD, MFA, MLS, MS, MSW, PhD) from your name on the résumé. Your identity and your training are two different

things. There’s a home for this information in the Education section.   
Avoid duplication.

# Your Address

If you live in an apartment, include your apartment number on your résumé. Many candidates mistakenly think a house address appears more prestigious than an apartment address, so they omit this information. However, mail is easily delayed or lost when the apartment number is missing, so include it in your address.

If you can, avoid using a post office box for an address. It implies instability and impermanence to the reader.

Do not spell out the name of your state. Use the generally accepted two-letter capitalized postal abbreviation. You have at most ten seconds of your reader’s eyeball time. Don’t waste a second on trivia.

If you do not know it already, get your nine-digit Zip code from www.usps.com or from your local post office. Using it is a sign that you pay attention to detail, a valued skill.

# Your Phone Number

Include your home and/or personal cell phone number. Not your work phone. Not a cell phone paid for by your employer. Callers can generally infer from the voice-mail message on an employer-paid phone that it is an employer-paid phone. You do not want to be perceived as someone who uses—and will use—an employer’s time and resources to find another job.

Do not include pager numbers of any kind, business or personal. Make responding easy for the reader.

# Your Fax Number

If you have a home fax number, list it. Do not use an employer’s fax number.

# Your E-Mail Address

An e-mail address implies comfort with computers. If you have a personal e-mail address you check daily, then list it. If not, do not. If your personal e-mail address is silly, create a new and more appropriate one. (At the time of this writing, free e-mail is available at www.gmail.com, www.yahoo.com, www.hotmail.com, and other sites.) In order to be contacted, you must first be taken seriously. Use this new e-mail address for sending résumés to prospective employers and check it for new mail daily. Do not send from one address and ask recipients to respond to—by having to type or cut and paste—another address. Again, make responding easy for the reader.

The more attention you give to such details, the less work you ask your reader to do. When reading résumés, hiring managers sometimes feel like the Rodney Dangerfields of the work world: they get no respect. Be the exception; sweat the details and respect your reader.

# Sell Your Skills and Experience—Always with the Reader in Mind

We all long to be understood. Yet we know in life that a message received is often very different from the message sent. As you craft every section of your résumé, think about the receiver of your sales message so that your skills and experience—your unique story—can be easily and rapidly understood.

# Goal Section?

The only people who need a Goal section on their résumés are those who are changing careers. If you are not changing careers, do not include a Goal section. If you are changing careers, then give the goal a lot of thought because this (brief!) item must clearly state your intent to transition from your past work experience to your desired work experience.

A goal statement need not exceed two sentences. Keep in mind: transferable skills are what matter, and those will be clear from your position descriptions/blurbs and other sections. Keep your goal statement brief. For example, “Transition to and establish career in X.” may serve as a suitable goal statement.

Avoid a common error: do not use “To” as the first word in a goal. Instead, begin every sentence on your résumé, including your goal (if you need one), with a verb/action word.

# Goal vs. Objective

Both “goal” and “objective” convey the same information, but the latter takes longer to read. Goal conveys the needed information and respects the reader’s time.

# Executive Summary Section?

A summary at the top of a résumé is often interpreted to mean, “My résumé is kind of long and tedious. Here is the good stuff you really need to know about me, so you need not actually read the whole document.” Is this an admission you want to make? Properly written, your résumé is a summary. If it needs summarizing, then it needs work.

# Give Readers a Reason to Believe

Despite our best intentions, sometimes our wording is too vague to be taken seriously—and in the absence of clear evidence, vague claims are usually interpreted as empty claims.

Most of the résumés employers receive are loaded with vague claims. Avoid such claims and your résumé will stand out from the stack. See examples in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Vague claims to avoid.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Able</td><td>Appealing</td><td>Capable</td></tr><tr><td>Active</td><td>Articulate*</td><td>Careful</td></tr><tr><td>Adaptable</td><td>Assertive</td><td>Cautious</td></tr><tr><td>Adept</td><td>Astute</td><td>Charitable</td></tr><tr><td>Aggressive</td><td>Attentive</td><td>Charming</td></tr><tr><td>Alert*</td><td>Attractive</td><td>Cheerful</td></tr><tr><td>Amazing</td><td>Brilliant</td><td>Clean*</td></tr><tr><td>Ambitious</td><td>Bubbly</td><td>Clear-headed</td></tr><tr><td>Amiable</td><td>Business-like</td><td>Clever</td></tr><tr><td>Analytical</td><td>Calm*</td><td>Committed*</td></tr></table></body></html>

${ } ^ { \ast } \mathrm { D o }$ not use as an adjective/descriptive word.

Why write such vague and unconvincing claims when specific action statements provide quick and powerful evidence of important skills? For example, compare “Excellent written communications skills” and “Wrote jargon-free User Guide for 11,000 users.” Do you see the crucial difference? The former is hollow self-puffery; the latter, credible evidence of a useful skill. See Figure 2 for more examples.

As you write:

• Avoid vague claims.   
• Use brief, specific examples to demonstrate—rather than merely claim—skills.

Figure 2. Hollow self-puffery versus evidence of useful skills.

# Education or Work Experience Section First?

If you are attending or you recently completed vocational school, college, or graduate school, and you have little relevant work experience, place your Education section first. If you have a lot of relevant work experience (even if you recently returned to school), place your Work Experience section first.

# ”Work Experience” vs. “Professional Experience”

Both terms convey the same information, but the latter takes longer to read. “Work Experience” conveys the needed information and respects the reader’s time.

”Experience” alone (without “Work” or “Professional”) is ideal, but only on résumés with no Volunteer Experience section.

No colon is required after this or any other section heading on your résumé.

# Position Descriptions/Blurbs

When the starting month and year and ending month and year are omitted from an entry, readers may infer: (1) an attempt to disguise gaps (whether the candidate is doing so or not), (2) the candidate has a poor memory, or (3) the candidate is too lazy to retrieve the information. None of these is a desirable message to send. Include the starting month and year and ending month and year for each entry.

In the United States, there is no zero used to express any of the months, except in $^ { * } 1 0 ^ { * }$ to represent October. For example, “January 2003 through July $2 0 0 5 '$ is written “1/03–7/05,” not “01/03–07/05,” and not “January 2003 through July $2 0 0 5 '$ —also a waste of the reader’s time.

Omit the street addresses and Zip codes of employers. The city and state will do:

1/99–1/02 Big Giant Company, Inc., Metropolis, NY [Strike TAB key after end date.]

Think outside the cubicle: replace “internal-speak” position titles with titles outsiders can easily understand. If, for example, your internal title is CSR4, then write an accurate and understandable equivalent instead (e.g., Senior Customer Service Representative). Make understanding easy for the reader.

Exclude bullets. Long ago, bullets were intended to precede a single word. Over time people stretched their use to phrases, then whole thoughts, then paragraphs with connecting thoughts. Nowadays, bullets waste space on a résumé. Neither a bullet nor any other symbol will propel a reader’s eyes and interest on a résumé as quickly as a thoughtful and succinct paragraph. Use from three to six sentences/action statements in a paragraph to construct a position description/blurb for each position.

On an $8 ^ { 1 } / _ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 1$ -inch résumé page with 1-inch margins, a position description/blurb as long as the preceding paragraph would (1) save space and (2) require readers to move their eyes from left to right five times. This is faster and easier—37.5 percent fewer eye movements— than reading the same words with bullets. Look at the points made in the previous paragraph, presented instead in a bulleted list:

• Exclude bullets.   
• Long ago, bullets were intended to precede a single word. Over time people stretched their use to phrases, then whole thoughts, then paragraphs with connecting thoughts.   
• Nowadays, bullets waste space on a résumé.   
• Neither a bullet nor any other symbol will propel a reader’s eyes and interest on a résumé as quickly as a thoughtful and succinct paragraph.   
• Use from three to six sentences/action statements in a paragraph to construct a position description/blurb for each position.

On an $8 ^ { 1 } / _ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 1$ -inch résumé page with 1-inch margins, a position description as long as the preceding bulleted list would (1) waste space and (2) require readers to move their eyes from left to right eight times. This is slower and more difficult—60 percent more eye movements—than reading the same words in a paragraph. Make understanding easy for the reader and make the most effective use of your eight to ten seconds of the reader’s attention—use thoughtful and succinct paragraphs for position descriptions.

Some positions, especially the more junior or less recent ones with obvious titles, require no descriptive blurb at all. Every reader knows what a cashier or a waiter does, for example. There’s no need to list each task.

If you held the same position in two or more organizations, just one descriptive blurb may be required. There are exceptions, however; each case is unique. For example, a candidate who has worked as an emergency room nurse at three urban public hospitals may require only one blurb, while a candidate who has worked as an emergency room nurse at one tribal hospital, one suburban private hospital, and one urban public hospital may require three blurbs.

When writing about positions assigned through a temporary agency, candidates often mistakenly list their work sites as their employers. Doing this is not only inaccurate but also may later be seen as an attempt to intentionally misrepresent the facts. Your employer is the organization that issues your payroll checks; this is usually the agency. Work sites are appropriately named in the blurb, especially if they are particularly prestigious.

Exclude the word I from your résumé. Start every sentence with a verb/action word (see Figure 5). Remember to include cooperative verbs, too. For example, “Co-created X,” “Participated in development of X,” “Collaborated with A and B on X,” and like phrases tell employers you play well with others.

Look beyond the usual for the strongest and most accurate action words. Some examples from the list shown in Figure 5 (presented later) are: adapt, analyze, cultivate, defuse, enhance, familiarize, foster, harness, initiate, interpret, navigate, nurture, persuade, streamline, synthesize, and target. Use present-tense verbs (e.g., write) as appropriate for your current position and past-tense verbs (e.g., wrote) for all previous positions.

Save space:

• Although in other documents the numbers 1 through 9 are often expressed in words, in résumé blurbs these numbers may be expressed using numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) instead.   
• The numbers 10 and up may be expressed using numerals as well (e.g., 40; 800; 12,000).   
• When referring to monetary values, use $K$ to express “thousands” (e.g., $\$ 20\mathrm { K }$ instead of $\$ 20,000$ , $\$ 20$ thousand, 20 thousand dollars, or twenty thousand dollars).   
When referring to monetary values, use $M$ to express “millions” (e.g., $\$ 200$ instead of $\$ 20,000,000$ , $\$ 20$ million, 20 million dollars, or twenty million dollars).   
• The phrase “more than” may be expressed by adding a plus $\left( + \right)$ to a number (e.g., “Wrote XYZ Quarterly for $5 0 0 +$ staff” instead of “Wrote XYZ Quarterly for more than 500 staff”).   
• The word percent may be expressed using the symbol $( \% )$ instead (e.g., “Achieved record-setting $1 1 7 \%$ of annual sales quota”).   
• The word per may be replaced with the forward slash $( / )$ (e.g., “Achieved fivefold sales increase—from $\$ 120\mathrm { K }$ to $\$ 720\mathrm { K }$ /year”).   
• If necessary, the word and may also be expressed using the forward slash (/) (e.g., “Analyzed 50 businesses owned/operated by consumers with mental illnesses”).

# More Words and Phrases to Avoid

Why write “utilize” when “use” is simpler and more direct? Why write “Was responsible for office management” when “Managed office” is more active and more direct?

If any of the words or phrases in Figure 3 are on your résumé, then cut them out and rewrite your sentences so they are simpler and more direct.

The blurb is not intended to list everything you did in each position. Employers know this. I repeat: employers know this. Be terse and pithy. Get to the point. Stick to the highlights. A descriptive blurb is not a job description. In fact, if you are using a copy of a job description to help you write your résumé, throw it away. Instead, as you write a blurb for each position, think beyond your specific tasks and your department:

• In what ways does your work impact other departments?   
• In what ways does your work contribute to the overall success of the organization?   
Have you identified problems and solved them? If so, give brief examples.   
• Have you identified opportunities and acted on them? If so, give brief examples.   
• Have you worked collaboratively? If so, what did doing so accomplish?   
• Pretend you’re the reader. As an employer, what would you want to know?

What’s your “elevator speech”? If you ran into a prospective employer in an elevator, how would you describe the highlights of what you do in three or four concise sentences, before the elevator arrives at the employer’s floor? Think about it. Once you’ve figured this out, drop the word I from each sentence and, voilà, you have the blurb for your present position.

4/92–6/93 Sales Manager

Notice that there is no blurb for Sales Manager. A blurb is not always required for every position. In this case, the blurb for Sales and Marketing VP conveys an overview of sales achievement.

Notice also that present-tense verbs/action words are used for a current position and past-tense verbs/action words for past positions.

On an $8 ^ { 1 } / _ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 1$ -inch résumé page with 1-inch margins, none of the sample blurbs uses more than six lines of text—the most that’s needed to convey the highlights of nearly any position. See Appendix A for more examples of effective position descriptions/blurbs.

# Sentences/Action Statements

The action statements in each blurb represent examples of the skills you can bring to bear wherever you work. The power of these examples is at the heart of a winning résumé. Make each action statement clear, pack it with compelling evidence of your relevant skills, and keep it brief. See Figure 4.

# Verbs/Action Words

Begin every action statement of every blurb with an action word. See Figure 5. Shop here for the most accurate and powerful action words to briefly describe your achievements. Choose your action words with care. (text continues on page 45)

# Volunteer Experience Section

Often overlooked or dismissed by candidates, volunteer experience is valuable information to a prospective employer if the skills used as a volunteer are relevant to an employer’s requirements. For example, your volunteer work as a youth hockey coach is worth mentioning if you seek a paid teaching or coaching position, or any position requiring team-building skills. If a hiring manager reads of your service as a literacy tutor, he or she can easily infer your patience, a valuable skill. Likewise, if a reader sees you participated in an AIDS charity bike ride from Boston to New York City, he or she can glean from this your endurance and determination, valued skills in any organization.

# Education Section

If you have completed one or more degrees, then include your graduation dates. Many employers interpret the absence of dates to mean (1) the candidate is attempting to hide his or her age and (2) the candidate is acknowledging that his or her age is something to be hidden. Why send these messages? Many talented, full-blown adults graduated from college before last Thursday. If you graduated in 1962, write it. Do you think the reader won’t do the math some other way or won’t figure it out when you meet? Don’t hide your academic history. Write it proudly.

Employers hiring recent graduates from MBA, JD, and some other programs usually require each candidate to include his or her grade point average (GPA) on a résumé. Even if you are not a recent graduate, if you completed college or graduate school with a stellar GPA, you may choose to include it on your résumé. If you received honors, you may choose to include this, too. If you attended school at night for four years, this says a lot about you, so there is no reason to keep it a secret, either:

# Education

6/87–5/91

Clark University, Metropolis, MA (nights) Bachelor of Science, Economics, GPA 3.59

[Strike the TAB key after the end date on the first line and at beginning of the second line.]

If still in school, write “degree expected [month/year]” after the name of the degree:

# Education

9/05–present Clark University, Metropolis, MA Bachelor of Arts, Music, degree expected 5/09 [Strike the TAB key after present on the first line and at beginning of the second line.]

If your résumé includes mention of a college degree (or “degree expected”), high school graduation is implied and thus need not be included.

If you have no college degree but some training, create a Relevant Coursework or Relevant Education/Training section (instead of an Education section) to include any relevant courses, seminars, or workshops you have completed, with the starting month and year (and ending month and year, if different) for each.

If you have no college education or relevant training but graduated from high school or earned your General Educational Development (GED), list it in your Education section. If you graduated from a specialized competitive-entry high school (for young artists or scientists, for example), specify this.

If you have no material for an Education section, focus on writing the other sections where your self-taught skills will shine through (work experience, volunteer experience, software skills, language skills, and so forth) and increase your knowledge and marketable skills by taking useful courses at a school near you.\*

# Inventions, Published Works, Seminars Section

If you have invented, published, or lectured, and if these accomplishments relate to your current career path, then include a section to briefly list them:

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Published Works, Seminars</td></tr><tr><td>9/01</td><td>&quot;Make Your Skills Jump off the Page&quot;</td></tr><tr><td>11/00</td><td>(seminar given at Metropolis University, Metropolis, NY) &quot;Resumes: Writing a Knock&#x27;em Dead Resume&#x27;</td></tr><tr><td>1/00</td><td>(article for ivillage.com) &quot;13 Truths about Resumes and Cover Letters&quot; (article for click4careercoaching.com)</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Software Skills Section

If you are not an information technology (IT) candidate, but you do use a personal computer (PC), then include on your résumé the operating systems (e.g., MS-DOS, Windows, MAC-OS), office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Publisher, Netscape), and programming languages (e.g., $C + +$ , Java, Visual Basic, HTML, COBOL)

you use. Omit version numbers; if you use one version, then you can learn another. Here is a sample:

Software Skills   
MS-DOS, Windows, MAC-OS, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher,   
FrontPage, Explorer

(This Software Skills section implies the ability to use/navigate Windows.)

Some candidates will include a long list of software skills on their résumé, then send their cover letter and résumé in a handwritten envelope. Learn to print an envelope. It will make your software claims a lot more credible.

The point of this section is not to list every application you have ever used. It is simply to convey two facts: (1) you do not fear technology and (2) faced with any new software, all you need is a user guide and a little time to master it.

If the speed and accuracy of your typing are impressive and the position you seek demands these skills, then take the test at www.typingtest.com (free at the time of this writing) and include the error-free result (e.g., “Word (80wpm)”) in this section.

If you are an IT candidate, you may naturally have a longer list of skills in this section. Use Software/Systems Skills (instead of Software Skills) as a heading, with subsections as needed:

Software/Systems Skills   
Languages/Environments: PowerBuilder, Korn Shell, C, COBOL,   
Oracle SQLPlus, PL/SQL, Visual Basic, Visual InterDev (VB Script),   
CA-Librarian, CICS, TSO/ISPF, Focus, PL/1, MarkIV   
Operating Systems: Unix AIX, MVS, DOS, Windows NT   
Databases: Oracle, Access, ADR DataCom   
Desktop Applications: Word, Excel, Netscape, Explorer   
Machines: IBM 370/158, IBM 3033, IBM 3083/Model B CPU, PCs

(This Software/Systems Skills section implies the ability to program for Windows.)

# Language Skills Section

If you are fluent in any language other than English, include a Language Skills section on your résumé. Specify whether you read, write, and/or speak the language. For example:

Language Skills Spanish (read), French (read, write, and speak), German (speak)

If you have mastered American Sign Language or Braille, include it in this section, too.

# Memberships Section

If your membership in an organization helps you build skills relevant to an employer, then include it.

If a membership (or volunteer experience) helps you effectively showcase marketable skills, then don’t necessarily exclude it for fear of exposing other information. If, for example, you’re actively involved in a group whose name reveals you may be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, of a particular faith, or possess any other characteristic unrelated to merit—and if your role involves skills useful to an employer—write it proudly. Being ruled out for a job on the basis of any criterion other than merit is a useful warning. You wouldn’t want to work for such employers anyway. It’s their loss. Many hiring managers with a brain and a pulse will happily scoop up qualified people to help them compete in the marketplace.

What do you do for the organization? Briefly mention it:

# Memberships

9/01–present Gay and Straight Alliance of Xtown, Xtown, NY Co-facilitate 6 meetings (2 groups, 3 sessions each)/month. Contribute Web content.

When deciding to include or exclude, the test is this: Is the information needed to make an effective pitch? If, in this case, you have already included on your résumé plenty of other examples of group facilitation skills and Web writing experience, you may choose to omit this membership. Similarly, if you only attend groups (vs. co-facilitate them) and visit the Web site (vs. contribute content to it), then, again: Is the information needed to make an effective pitch?

In each case, use your judgment to assess the risks and benefits of inclusion. Do not prejudge all prospective employers as racist, homophobic, anti-faith, and so forth.

# References Statement?

Exclude “References available on request.” Employers know this already.

# Personal Information Section?

In the United States, listing one’s age, height, and weight,\* hobbies, interests, health, and marital or parental status on a résumé is generally a waste of the reader’s time, and may be seen—depending on the organization’s culture—as inappropriate, irrelevant, silly, and of absolutely zero interest to the reader. Your résumé is not an autobiography.

Rather than omitting all hobbies and interests, however, you may decide there are exceptions. Use your judgment. If a particular hobby or interest genuinely contributes to your relevant skills, include it. If you choose to include a Relevant Hobbies/Interests section, proceed with caution.

# Artwork, Photos, Decorative Borders, and Line Art

Artwork and photos are not part of a résumé. If they are required by an employer, include them in a separate portfolio.

Decorative borders and line art are similarly inappropriate on a résumé. Fair or not, to many readers there is a fine line between artistic/whimsical (sometimes suitable) and flaky/inappropriate (at no time suitable). Skilled graphic artists know that context is important. A résumé is not the proper context for decorative borders and line art.

Here are four sample résumés using some of the previously mentioned résumé sections. Remember: the sequence, number, and nature of the sections you include on your résumé will be based not on any samples but solely on your unique story.

# Deliver Your Message the Right Way to the Right Places

Whether, how, when, and where to send your résumé are decisions as important as the decisions you make as you design each element of its content.

# Sending Your Résumé

Employers often receive résumés so unrelated to the requirements for an available position (and cover letters so devoid of enthusiasm) that they openly wonder why candidates even bothered to send them. This happens a lot.

Sending a résumé—no matter how well written—in response to an unsuitable opening is a common and easily preventable cause for receiving no invitation to interview. Ask yourself:

• Do I meet all or almost all requirements for the position?\* • Am I really interested in the work, hours, and location?

If either answer is no, then do not send your résumé. If both answers are yes, then respond to the ad or job listing by sending a Response Letter (see pp. 63–67) and your résumé to the employer.

Unless specifically prohibited, send your documents every way you can. This includes snail mail, fax, e-mail, and by hand. Repeated exposure shows perseverance and genuine interest.

Rather than sending your documents by all four methods at the same time, however, you may choose instead to wait a few days or even a week between methods to see in each case if fewer methods will generate a response. (When you can, avoid snail mail as the first in your sequence, though, since it is the slowest of the four.\*) There’s a fine line between perseverance and pestering; aim not to cross it.

Employers often receive e-mail attachments in file formats they cannot open. Such formats imply inconsiderate candidates. Do not assume employers have the time or the inclination to “unzip” or otherwise convert your files. E-mail your résumé either as a Microsoft Word attachment\*\* or in the body of an e-mail message. Doing so implies a considerate candidate.

If you send an attachment, first name the file in a way that is helpful to the recipient. A file named “myresume” may be useful to you at home but is of little use to an employer receiving thousands of résumés. Instead, use an easily understandable naming protocol (e.g., “resumelastfirstmiddlename”). Doing so is a big help to the people receiving your information.

Although Microsoft Word attachments are now generally accepted when sending e-mail, some employers require you instead to send your résumé in the body of an e-mail message. Here’s how to do it:

# How to Send Your Résumé in the Body of an E-Mail

1. Using “Save As” in Microsoft Word, create a second version of your résumé in “text only” instead of “Word Document” format.   
2. Remove italics, bold, and symbols, if any.   
3. Delete tabs between text and replace them with one comma and one space.   
4. “Align left” all text with a maximum of sixty-five characters and spaces per line.   
5. Block (SHIFT- $\mathfrak { V }$ ) all text, copy (CTRL-C) it, and then paste (CTRL-V) it into the body of your e-mail.   
6. Adjust it as needed in your e-mail.   
7. E-mail it to yourself first. (Many candidates forget to do this.)   
8. See how it looks on the screen when you receive it, and print it to see how it looks on paper.   
9. Adjust it again as needed.   
10. When your document looks great on screen and on paper, then block, copy, paste into a new e-mail, and send it to a prospective employer.

(Responding to job listings is not always the most effective way to find great work. See pp. 67-68 to learn about the often-forgotten Inquiry Letter.)

Whether responding or inquiring, call—and check the Web site, if there is one—to obtain the correct spellings for the current names and titles of the human resources manager and the relevant department manager, even for names you are convinced have only one possible spelling.

# Job/Career Fairs and Reverse Job/Career Fairs

You may want to use your résumé at job/career fairs; proceed with caution when deciding whether to attend at all, however. The most successful such fairs (1) are free (beware if there is an admission fee), (2) include a substantial number of employers, and (3) are sponsored by a reputable organization. If you are interested in working with nonprofits, for example, then go to www.idealist.org and enter “career fairs” in the search box for a list of nonprofit career fairs.

Reverse job/career fairs, where candidates have booths and employers attend, are a recent phenomenon and these too are best when they (1) are free to candidates, (2) include many employers, and (3) are sponsored by a trusted organization.

# Responding to Blind Ads

Some ads do not reveal an employer or headhunter name. Why? There are many reasons. Here are three: A small employer may be trying to save money on an ad by reducing the number of words the ad contains. Another (less innocuous) reason is that a less-than-reputable headhunter may be trawling for résumés for potential employerclients. A third reason is that an employer may not want to reveal a strategically important opening to suppliers, competitors, clients, or prospects.

Whatever the reason, there are several ways to look for the missing information. Here are two: If an ad lists only a fax number, go to www.google.com. At google.com, (1) type the fax number (e.g., “123- 456-7890” with the quotation marks) and get the result or (2) type “freeality reverse lookup” and use the free tools there to get the result. If you find the result is a headhunter, you may choose not to respond. (Here’s why: Reputable headhunters tend to proudly advertise their identities rather than hide them using blind ads.) However, you may find in the results an employer name and phone number. If so, you can call for the correctly spelled name of both the human resources manager and the hiring manager. Your response letter will be one of only a few in the stack with this information.

If an ad reveals only an e-mail address as the contact, there are many ways to find out more. Here are two: Usually, the part of the address after $@$ is an active Web site address. Type it (the part after $@$ )

into the “location” (Netscape) or “address” (Explorer) field in your Web browser, get the results, and learn more. If the portion of the address after $@$ is a community or mail site (e.g., www.gmail.com, www.yahoo.com, www.hotmail.com) rather than an employer Web site, then there’s another way to learn more. Use www.freeality.com (or one of many other sites) to do a reverse lookup by e-mail address. Again, if you find the result is a headhunter, you may choose not to respond. However, you may find in the results an employer name and phone number. If so, you can call for the correctly spelled name of both the human resources manager and hiring manager. Again, your response letter will be one of only a few in the stack with this information.

If the ad contains only a post office box as contact, this is a giant red flag and you may not want to respond. Such ads may be from disreputable companies. However, if you decide to respond anyway, there is a way to learn more. Call the postal service in the city or town where the box is located. As of this writing, the postal service (in the United States) is required to disclose upon request the name of the owner of a post office box.

If the ad states only a newspaper’s private box number as contact, this too may be a red flag. However, if you decide to respond anyway, there is little in this case you can do to discover the identity of the owner of the box unless you have a connection at the newspaper. Without asking anyone to break any rules, you can ask for the information, however, and a nice (or new) newspaper advertising department employee may provide it.

It is generally unwise to respond to requests for salary requirements (see pp. 71-72) or salary history (see pp. 72-75) when choosing to answer a blind ad. Giving such private data to an unnamed and unaccountable person or organization is an invitation to trouble.

If the job and the employer described in a blind ad strike you as familiar, if the ad reads like an upbeat version of your or a co-worker’s present job, then it may help to recall the famous horror movie line, “The call is coming from inside the house.” Think about it.

You get only one chance to make a first impression. If you’re like many candidates, you think it’s when you walk into an interview, but it’s really the moment a human resources or hiring manager glances at your cover letter. Few people will read even a perfect résumé if your cover letter has errors, is unclear, or is unfocused; and if in this case your résumé is left unread, there will be no in-person interview.

# Cover Letters in General

In order to produce an error-free cover letter, be sure to remember these three items (excerpted here from page xvii as reminders):

1. Don’t count on your spell-check. Spell-check is not an editor: form vs. from escapes spell-check, as does their vs. there vs. they’re, among countless other such examples. If one mistakenly types copletion instead of completion, several versions of Microsoft Word will suggest replacing it with copulation instead of completion. Use a dictionary. 2. Don’t skip the step of proofreading your finished product. In addition to rereading your documents from start to finish to check for clarity, also read them backwards to catch typos. This will slow your reading and allow you to focus on each word.

3. Don’t overlook having other qualified people review your finished product. Have your documents reviewed by at least two other people (a) who routinely hire people as part of their work and (b) whose writing skills and candor you respect. Here’s the hard part: listen to what they have to say. As writers, sometimes we have to delete cherished words and phrases to create the clearest, most focused documents. It often takes another qualified set of eyeballs to help with this.

Unless there is a specific prohibition on phone calls stated in an ad or listing, call for the hiring manager’s current title and the correct spelling of his or her name. If the organization is big enough, there will be both a human resources name and title and a hiring department manager name and title (obviously the same person if you seek a human resources position)—get (and send to) both if you can. Ask to confirm the spelling even for names you think could have only one spelling. Chris could be Kris, Terry could be Terri, Mark could be Marc, John could be Jon, and Jason could be Jayson. Why not be seen as the one in 100 candidates who took the time to get it right?

Make it easy for the reader to recognize and reach you. Block (SHIFT- $\mathfrak { V }$ ) and copy (CTRL-C) your “heading” (name, address, phone, fax, and e-mail) from your résumé and paste (CTRL-V) it at the top of your cover letter. Sometimes, cover letters mistakenly get separated from résumés. If a cover letter is compelling enough, it may even generate a phone call without a résumé, but only if contact information is on the letter.

If you use a similar letter for more than one employer, remember to change the name and address in each letter. Candidates reveal lack of attention to detail by leaving a wrong name or address in what looks like—because it is—a carelessly assembled form letter.

Less is more. A long cover letter is often interpreted to mean, “The following résumé may not be too clear, so here are the important things from it I’d like you to know.” Is this an admission you want to make? Instead, have a clear and focused résumé so your cover letter need not be a novel. Your cover letter needs only to capture and express your enthusiasm, getting the reader to look at your résumé. Do not restate chunks of your résumé in your cover letter.

Anyone who advises candidates to write a four-paragraph cover letter is probably not an employer. You are more likely to win the lottery than to have any employer actually read a four-paragraph cover letter. Less really is more.

Beware of using humor. Professional comedians are paid well for a reason: comedy is more difficult than it looks. Not only is comedy subjective (i.e., different people laugh at different things), but even one person will respond differently at different times to the same humor. Plus, there is the risk of unintentionally offending some readers. Overriding these issues, however, is the likelihood of appearing less than professional and, therefore, not being taken seriously as a candidate.

Have you ever written a sentence and then questioned yourself about its appropriateness? When this happens, it is a signal: your instincts are telling you something. Listen to them. If you question the appropriateness of something you have written, your reader may, too. Trust your instincts and remove or replace the sentence.

Express your enthusiasm. If you don’t feel it, stop writing and ask yourself: Is this simply a bad time to write, or am I genuinely not enthused about this employer? If the former is the case, write at another time. If the latter is true, do not bother to write the letter at all. You will save yourself and the employer valuable time.

As you write:

• Express your enthusiasm without false praise.   
• Express confidence without arrogance.

These nuances are at the heart of a winning cover letter.

By the way, sign your letter. Do not use a hokey font that purports to—and never does—look like handwriting. However, if you use PC fax software to send your letter directly from Microsoft Word to the employer, then there is no paper to sign. Instead, (1) specify “Via fax software to: [fax number]” under the recipient’s address and (2) leave no blank lines between “Respectfully,” and your typed name. Similarly, one cannot grab a pen and sign an e-mail message. You do not need to abandon the human touch completely, however. “Dear [Properly Spelled Contact Name],” and “Respectfully, [Your Name]” remain appropriate in e-mail messages to employers. Be one of the few who help prove that civility is not dead.

The following is a sample response letter text for you to play with and make your own. Copying it word for word will prove embarrassing for you if competing candidates use the same text. Your letter should reflect your personality.

Given your requirements and my skills and experience, I may be the person you’re after. I am enthusiastic about [Organization Name] and this work.

Would you be so kind as to please review my résumé and contact me soon? I eagerly await your reply. Thank you in advance.

Respectfully, Jason D. Case

Do you think this is too brief? If so, I ask you to stop thinking like a candidate and start thinking like an employer. Imagine you are an employer. You are slogging through (not actually reading) hundreds of four-paragraph and even page-long response letters. Suddenly, you come across a breezy four-line letter. It stands out from the stack. It is visually different. It reflects a reader who respects your time. This candidate’s résumé is worth a look.

# The Unsung Hero of the Job Search: The Inquiry Letter

The inquiry letter is the unsung hero of the job search. It is arguably the least used and most powerful job search tool. Its use represents a very different way of looking for work. It changes the dynamic of the search, transitioning you to the role of an initiator from just one of many respondents.

New positions are frequently “in the pipeline”—being debated, created, and funded—well before a single job ad is placed. People are writing proposed job descriptions, fighting for budget dollars, and obtaining approvals for yet-to-be-advertised positions. A brief (!) enthusiastic inquiry letter and compelling résumé received during these planning stages often leads to a positive result for candidate and employer.

A well-written inquiry letter in a huge stack of response letters draws attention. Again, think like an employer: You’re opening 100 response letters and one very different letter appears—it’s oozing with enthusiasm, responding to nothing, from someone who just wants to be a part of your organization in whatever way you see fit—wouldn’t that letter stand out from the stack? Of course, it would. It’s always refreshing to see the initiative and genuine interest an inquiry letter represents.

Here is a sample inquiry letter text for you to play with and make your own. Copying it verbatim will prove embarrassing for you if competing candidates use the same text. Your letter should reflect your personality.

# Informational Interview Request Letter

Career path reconnaissance on the Web and at the library can yield much useful information, but even after you’ve read all you can about a line of work, you may still have some unanswered questions. It is often helpful to meet with an expert in your field of interest. An experienced perspective is invaluable.

Identify, ask, and meet with experts. Thorough career path reconnaissance can provide you with the names of experts in your field of interest. Send an informational interview request letter to several experts near you. There are many busy and well-paid experts kind and generous enough to give thirty minutes to help a newcomer.

Do not abuse this generosity by exceeding the allotted time or seeking a job from the expert. Instead, use the time to (1) ask thought ful questions prepared in advance, (2) listen carefully to the answers, and (3) take notes. Your only goal at an informational interview is to gain insights into the field. An expert may also provide you with contacts in a position to help you secure a position, but this is certainly not required—so do not expect it. Plus, if you attempt mid-meeting to change the stated agenda and cajole job leads from the expert, you risk creating a powerful foe and developing a poor reputation in your new field of interest.

Learn all you can about the field before you meet the expert. Otherwise, you will be wasting his or her (and your) time on questions easily answered on the Web or at the library.

Prepare your questions before you send an informational interview request letter, because the letter may quickly yield an unexpected call from the expert offering to answer questions on the phone. Be ready.

Here is a sample informational interview request letter text for you to play with and make your own. Do not copy it verbatim. Again, your letter should reflect your personality.

Dear [Contact Name],

I seek to learn more about the possibility of transitioning to a career in X. I have read about this line of work in The U.S. Occupational Outlook Handbook and other places, but I realize there is no substitute for experience. My reconnaissance tells me you’re an expert.

Would you be so kind as to meet with me for 30 minutes at a date and time convenient for you so I may ask you some prepared questions? I’d be very grateful. If your schedule does not permit this, would you refer me to a suitable colleague? Thank you in advance.

P.S. I enclose my résumé as an introduction and to give you a sense of my skills.

Error-free, clear, and focused cover letters are engaging, persuasive, powerful, and rare. You now have the information you need to craft yours.

# The Final Three Pre-Interview Items: Salary Requirements, Salary History, References

Here’s how you can prepare thoughtful responses to requests for salary requirements, salary history, and references—items for which on-thefly answers will not suffice.

# Request for Salary Requirements

Employers request salary requirements for several important reasons. Here are three:

1. They don’t have time to interview people they can’t afford to hire.   
2. They don’t want to waste the time of candidates they can’t afford to hire. It’s a small world: an applicant today may be a client tomorrow.   
3. They want to see if the candidate can follow directions. This is the reason few people talk about. Employers want to see if a prospective employee will do as asked, rather than ignore a request simply because the task—in this case, writing a thoughtful answer—is challenging. This is why many employers discard response letters and résumés from people who fail to address this request.

Here’s a sample response. Place your version at the end of your response letter.

P.S. While I also place value on a number of other factors, I require a starting salary in the mid- $\$ 80 s$ [or low $\$ \mathrm { X s }$ , mid $\$ \mathrm { X s }$ , high $\$ \mathrm { X s }$ .

On the phone or in person, if asked about these “other factors,” include: location, benefits, hours, working environment, company culture, opportunity for advancement, and any other noncash items of genuine importance to you. Although it’s not required, you may also choose to include some of these items in parentheses after the word factors and before the comma in the sample given.

Notice that ranges are used, not specific numbers. This gives the hiring manager an opportunity to exercise his or her judgment and shows your flexibility as well.

Do not include a statement of salary requirements unless an employer first requests one. Doing so (1) is seen as inappropriate, (2) may remove you from consideration, (3) reveals too much information, and (4) may cost you money if the range for the position is above your stated requirements.

# What if an employer reads my salary requirements and then ignores my résumé?

If this happens, then you are not a match for the current position, and your candor will have saved both you and the employer a lot of time and energy. Plus, many smart employers review and set aside rather than ignore the résumé of a skilled candidate they can’t afford now; when a different position or more funding emerges, the candidate may be the perfect match.

# Request for Salary History

Many candidates are annoyed by a request for salary history, and with good reason. Yes, it’s intrusive. Yes, it’s a red flag. Based on such a request, you may decide that the requesting organization is not the right employer for you. A request for salary history is the sign of an employer who mistakenly thinks there is some connection between previous and desired salaries. Such requests reflect a narrow view of the world and fail to recognize that (1) some people will gladly take a pay cut for the right position and (2) some people may have been significantly underpaid in the past and have no intention of continuing to be underpaid.

In any case, candidates risk having their response letters and résumés discarded by not responding to the request. Here is a sample salary history. Only provide a salary history if it is requested.

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Scott A. Bennett Confidential Salary History.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td>Employer</td><td colspan="2">Final Compensation</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">click4careercoaching.com, Metropolis, NY</td></tr><tr><td>1/00-present</td><td>General Manager (part-time)</td><td>variable</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">XYZ Foundation, Metropolis, NY</td></tr><tr><td>9/003/01</td><td>Career Developer</td><td>$45,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">ABC College School of Business, Metropolis, NY 11/97-5/99 Career Services Counselor</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>$36,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Self-employed, Metropolis, NY 5/96-present Freelance Writer and Lecturer variable</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">FireSoft/Public Service Computer Software, Inc., Metropolis, MA</td></tr><tr><td>8/94-4/96</td><td>President and Chief Operating Officer</td><td>$120,000 $80,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">6/93-8/94 Sales and Marketing VP</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">4/92-6/93 Sales Manager</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Tulip/Polymerics, Inc., Metropolis, MA and Cityville, MA $67,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">10/90-4/92 Director of Purchasing</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Command Marketing/American Optical Corporation, Metropolis, CA 4/89-7/90 Manager, Materials and Distribution $42,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">1/87-4/89 Materials Project Manager</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">1/86-1/87 Manager, Distribution, Western U.S.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">MetPath, Inc., Metropolis, CA and Eville, CA</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">1/85-1/86 Operations Manager</td></tr><tr><td>9/84-1/86</td><td>District Logistics Manager</td><td>$24,000 $22,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr><tr><td>9/83-9/84</td><td>Logistics Manager.

Notice the absence of the starting month and year and ending month and year to the left of each employer’s name. Unlike on a résumé, where such information is of use to the reader, it adds no value here and so can be excluded. Such dates to the left of each title are of use and important to include.

# Elements of Compensation for Salary History

Use the final (not the starting) compensation number for each position. Compensation includes more than salary. Remember to include:

• Differentials for work locations or shift schedules   
Overtime pay (Many candidates forget to include this.)   
• Monetary value of compensatory (comp) time Bonuses Commissions   
• Stock options   
Employer contributions to retirement plan   
• The annual monetary value of extraordinary benefits: – Portion of paid vacation above industry standard – 24/7 use of company car – Housing assistance – 100 percent tuition assistance – 100 percent health/disability/life insurance coverage with no paycheck deduction – Health club membership – Childcare services – Concierge services – Parking space in locations where parking is scarce (in several cities in the United States, this is worth from $\$ 2,400$ to over $\$ 6,000$ per year at the time of this writing)

Plus, if you declined to participate in an employer’s health insurance plan because, for example, you were already covered under your spouse’s/partner’s plan, then the employer may have paid you a share of the resulting savings. If so, then these payments are part of your compensation, too.

# References

A very popular reason employers request references is to see if a candidate is dumb enough to give bad ones. Few people talk about this, but now you know it. It’s so easy to get this right, yet many candidates get it wrong.

Ask potential references before using them as references. Many candidates forget to do this, and people (even people who could’ve been excellent references) don’t like such surprises. Prospective employers cannot always discern (nor should they have to) the difference between (1) the irritated voice of an unhappily surprised person and (2) a genuinely unenthusiastic reference.

Are you unsure how to ask someone to be a reference? If so, here are two ways:

1. “Are you willing to serve as a reference for me?” 2. “May I include your name and number when I provide references to employers?”

However you ask, after you ask, stop talking. Listen carefully to the response. Listen to both the content and the tone of the response. If a potential reference’s response is anything other than genuinely enthusiastic, do not use him or her as a reference.

If he or she respects your work but performs poorly on the phone, proceed with caution. A prospective employer—or anyone else, for that matter—can easily confuse a naturally low-key or monotone voice with an absence of enthusiasm. Smart candidates prevent this confusion whenever possible. Follow your instincts. You may choose not to use the person as a reference, or to simply warn prospective employers. For example, “Please bear in mind when you call her that Georgette is quite soft-spoken, but she has consistently rated my work ‘outstanding’ on performance appraisals.”

Here is a sample. Provide such data only if it is requested.

# Scott A. Bennett Professional References

John Lennon, VP, Operations (direct report) XYZ Foundation, Metropolis, NY 123-456-7890 (office)

Paul McCartney, Director of Student Services (final direct report) ABC College School of Business, Metropolis, NY 234-567-8901 (office)

Ringo Starr, Ed.D. (professor, group counseling) Adjunct Professor, Counseling Psychology Programs, Retired Metropolis University/Uptown Campus, Metropolis, NY 456-789-0123 (home)

Limit references to persons for whom you have completed paid or academic assignments.

It’s helpful to prospective employers to know with whom they are speaking: is it your manager (“direct report”)? An instructor? After each name, explain the reference’s relationship to you.

Be sure you are using the current phone number and only the one specified (office, home, or cell) by each reference.

Candidates whose work experience is with a family business face a special challenge. Although such references may understandably be viewed as less credible, include a relative as a reference if you worked for an extended period for the person. Explain the situation to each prospective employer requiring references.

We’ve examined the ways you can market your skills and experiences to employers. Next, let’s look at how you market to yourself.

# Marketing to Yourself

Many career writers often use the term “market yourself.” Words matter, though, so let’s clarify. What they really mean is “market your skills and experience,” not “market yourself.”

Another popular phrase used by career writers discussing salary is “What are you worth?” Again, words have meaning, and clarity is excellence. These writers really mean “What are some employers paying for a specific set of skills and experience?”

Why are these distinctions important? Because inaccurate but commonly used phrases such as these feed into the crazy and widely held notion that “I am my work.” If you believe you are your work, then what are you when you are out of work?

“I am my work” is just one example of the many crazy ideas we quietly tell ourselves again and again for years. What we tell ourselves—that is, how we market to ourselves—is at least as important as how we market our skills and experience to employers.

If you believe you can’t find work, you are likely to construct a résumé and do other things that will help you reinforce your belief. Few people do things in opposition to their own beliefs.

Do you recognize any of this thinking?

• I am my work.   
• Without my work I am nothing. • I can’t find work.   
• I’m too young for any employer to hire me.   
• I’m too old for any employer to hire me.   
• I’m too old to start a new career.   
• If I were a minority, I would get the job.   
• If I were a white male, I would get the job.   
• I’m underqualified.   
• I’m overqualified.   
• Most of the jobs out there are beneath me.   
• Employers feel threatened by my skills and experience.   
• Employers think former entrepreneurs can’t work for others.   
• I was fired, and I’ll never find another job.   
• I was laid off, and I’ll never find another job.   
• Employers don’t understand the duties of a working parent.   
• I’ve sent out lots of résumés and had no luck. See? • It’s political. It’s who you know, not what you know.   
• The longer it takes, the less likely I will ever find a job.   
• There are no jobs out there for me.   
• Each day I remain unemployed proves I can’t find another job • My search efforts shouldn’t have to be like a full-time job.   
• I should have now the job and salary I want to have.   
• Employers should respond to my résumé.   
• If I do not get a response from Company X, it will be awful.   
• An employer must call me this week.   
• If I don’t get a job this week, it will be awful. I can’t stand it.

None of these beliefs really serves the believer. Think about your beliefs about yourself, others, and the world. How are these beliefs working out for you?

How we react to and handle events is determined not by the events themselves but by how we view the events, often through the prism of our deeply held irrational beliefs. Although humans have a natural tendency to collect and nurture wacky beliefs, we also have the capac ity to identify, examine, and replace those wacky beliefs with effective rational beliefs.

For more information, read A Guide to Rational Living by Albert Ellis and Robert Harper (North Hollywood, Calif.: Wilshire Book Company, 1998).

# Conclusion: You’re the Carpenter

This and other books, Web sites, videos, software, assessment instruments, even counselors and coaches are merely tools in a toolbox. You are the carpenter. The choices are yours. The process of examining and developing your skills, interests, and values and actively constructing a career in light of these is a process owned 100 percent by you. I encourage you to wear this book out and let the building begin.

# More Examples of Effective Position Descriptions/Blurbs

View the following examples as food for thought, not material to be copied into your résumé. Notice the unique accomplishments of each candidate; because of this uniqueness, there exists no single blurb for every paralegal or every project manager or every coordinator or every nurse or every person in any position. Anyone who tells you otherwise (and gives you pages of boilerplate material to plop into your résumé) is underestimating your uniqueness. Employers can usually discern the difference between a thoughtlessly copied generic description and a genuine one resulting from careful thought. As the reader, you can infer a variety of skills from the following examples—although the blurbs contain no vague claims of skills (i.e., no hollow self-puffery, see pp. 22–26)—just concrete examples of skills in action.

If presented on an $8 ^ { 1 } / _ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 1$ -inch résumé page with 1-inch margins, most of the following examples (1) use no more than six lines of text, the most that’s needed to convey the highlights of nearly any position and (2) contain no orphans (single words appearing on the last line of a blurb). As you craft your unique blurbs, keep them within six lines of copy and avoid orphans.

# A Special Note to Homemakers

Whether you’re male or female, returning to paid work or seeking paid work for the first time, you may think you don’t have the skills needed to thrive in today’s competitive job market.

Hmm . . . let’s look at the facts. Homemakers have many skills to offer. Smart employers look beyond paid work to any evidence of transferable skills. Here is a giant sample position description/blurb (much larger than is appropriate for an actual résumé) containing many examples of action statements for homemakers. Each action statement gives the reader specific evidence of transferable skills. Use these examples as food for thought as you craft your own action statements unique to you.

On an $8 ^ { 1 } / _ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 1$ -inch résumé page with 1-inch margins, keep your position description/blurb to within six lines and avoid orphans (single words appearing on the last line of a blurb).

care for all family members. Establish clear requirements and discipline children. Drive children to schools, team sports, music lessons, and more. Negotiate with suppliers. Pay invoices. Reconcile accounts. Arrange for home and vehicle maintenance and repairs. Maintain clean home and clean clothes for family. Plan and create dinners to entertain mate’s employers, colleagues, clients, and prospects. Collaborate with mate to manage investments.

Clearly, creating a home and nurturing others require a variety of skills. It is obvious to any reader that many of these skills are transferable to paid work. Thus, there is no reason to omit or otherwise disguise or downplay the role of homemaker on your résumé. Rather than hide it, tell it—tell employers this important element of your unique story.

# A Special Note to Veterans

Write for readers who have little or no understanding of the military.   
Use plain English civilian terminology. As you write, omit/exclude:

• Military terminology/jargon • Military acronyms • Military slang • Military abbreviations • Details of combat

Since you are transitioning into a new career, include a Goal section (see page 21).

Create position descriptions/blurbs containing plenty of action statements (i.e., evidence of transferable skills)\* and get specific. For example:

• Number of people managed   
• Dollar amounts of budgets managed   
• Dollar value of assets you managed   
“Civilian-transferable” skills training you have given to others   
• Problems/opportunities successfully identified and acted upon   
• Security clearances given to you (e.g., high-risk public trust, confidential, secret, or top secret)

In an Education section, include training you have received, but be selective. For example, omit training in marksmanship (unless you seek law enforcement work) and hand-to-hand combat, but include courses in logistics, technology, or the many other areas readily transferable to civilian work.

Find and carefully review any written evaluations you have received; these often contain useful food for thought when writing a résumé.

When getting your résumé reviewed (see item 8 on page xvii), be sure to get civilian reviewers. Ex-military people who have successfully transitioned to civilian career paths can make excellent reviewers, too, provided they meet the criteria in item 8 on page xvii.

Many free career resources for veterans are available on the Web. For example, go to click4careercoaching.com, click on “Use My Great Job Links and Job Hotlines,” and see the “Links for Persons Transitioning from the U.S. Military.”

If you have less than an honorable discharge (e.g., general, undesirable, bad conduct, or dishonorable), there is a chance you can have your discharge upgraded by the Discharge Review Board or Board of Correction of Military Records of the appropriate branch of service. Contact your local legal service agency (e.g., Legal Aid Society) or Red Cross, Veterans Center, or State Division of Veterans’ Affairs for help. Doing so can improve your chances with employers who request your discharge papers.

Before applying for a discharge upgrade, be sure to request, obtain, and carefully save copies of your military records from Military Personnal Records Center, 9700 Page Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63132- 1547. This is important because after you apply for a discharge upgrade, your records are sealed forever; neither you nor your attorney may view them.

Old discharge papers (form DD-214) include “SPN” or “spin” numbers that can identify people with drug or alcohol problems. Many employers can translate the spin numbers, so if these are issues for you, also request from St. Louis copies of the DD-214 with the spin number deleted.

# A Special Note to Ex-Offenders

Ex-offenders searching for work face plenty of challenges. What is the biggest one?

• Being banned from receiving food stamps or other financial assistance? No.   
Being banned from taking some jobs (e.g., security, medicine, childcare, education)? No.   
• Being unfairly discriminated against by many narrow-minded employers? No. Recovering from substance abuse?\* No. Finding stable housing? No. Getting access to transportation? No. Getting access to health care? No. Improving basic skills?\*\* No.   
Finding interview/work clothes?† No.   
• Re-unification with loved ones? No.   
• The belief that no employer will hire you because you are an exoffender? Yes.

Believing that no employer will hire you because you are an exoffender is your single biggest barrier to finding legal paid work. If you believe no employer will hire you because you are an ex-offender, you might as well stop reading; none of the following information will be of any use to you until you choose to change this belief.

Choosing to change negative beliefs is important. Drama inside your head can make it hard to believe in yourself. If you often have negative thoughts, argue, feel stressed, sad, or angry, there are ways to make it better. Ask your probation/parole officer to refer you to a clinical social worker or other mental health professional trained in rational emotive behavior therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy to help people think in ways that help them feel and do better. How you think about the job search (or anything else, for that matter) deeply affects results.

Once you believe—or act as if you believe until you really do believe—that an employer will hire you, it is time to create a résumé that will honestly get your phone to ring.

As mentioned in item number 1 on page xiv, don’t make stuff up. There are many reasons to not make stuff up on your résumé or on a job application. If you lie and an employer finds out, you will very likely be immediately dismissed and maybe even criminally prosecuted for “willful misrepresentation.” How can an employer find out? The information may slip out. Anyone who knows or recognizes you may (1) unintentionally communicate something that reveals your offense to your employer, (2) intentionally reveal, or (3) threaten to reveal. You do not need a secret and a potential crisis hanging over your head every day.

Therefore, do not write false starting dates or ending dates (see page 6) to mask the time during which you were incarcerated. Instead, write real starting and ending dates (month and year) and focus on including on your résumé all the transferable skills you have to offer. Prior to or while serving your sentence, did you get any vocational training? Did you work? Are you skilled in woodworking, carpentry, plumbing, painting, cleaning, electrical, metal work, food prep or cooking, landscaping, office equipment (phone, fax, copier, or computer), bookkeeping? Did you take any classes? Can you speak, read, or write a language other than English? Have you done volunteer work? In what ways did you participate in pre-release programs? Honestly list your accomplishments on your résumé and on job applications.

As you transition to the job market:

• Act as if you believe—until you really do believe—an employer will hire you.   
• Create—alone or with help—an honest résumé. Do not be persuaded otherwise.   
• Get a disposition slip for each offense from the court of conviction so you are ready for an employer’s request.   
• Rap sheets often contain damaging mistakes. Request a copy of yours from the appropriate state agency, review it, and then submit original disposition slips to correct the record.   
• Ask people who can attest to how your behaviors have changed for the better to serve as references. See pages 75–76. If you’re playing by the rules, then your parole officer can serve as an excellent reference.   
• Think about, write, and rehearse in front of a mirror at least 100 times your three-part, sixty-second explanation of (1) your errors in judgment, (2) the lessons you’ve learned from these errors, and (3) your total commitment to a new path.   
• Ask your local librarian for information on and forms for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and bring the forms to interviews. Give the forms to employers and explain that in addition to getting a good worker, if they hire you they can also get money (up to $\$ 2,400$ at the time of this writing) from the government.   
Contact your state division of parole or, if you still have one, ask   
your parole officer to help you obtain certificates of rehabilitation (e.g., relief from disabilities, good conduct) that remove some restrictions on employment.   
Ask your local librarian (or call 1-877-872-5627) for information on and forms for the Federal Bonding Program. Bring this information and the forms to interviews, too. Use your judgment. If you think it will help, give the forms to employers and explain that this program helps protect employers (at no cost to them) against loss of money or property due to employer dishonesty.   
Avoid spending time with anyone who is engaged in illegal   
behaviors.   
Reach out to other ex-offenders who have successfully returned to legal paid work.

# A Special Note to People in Recovery

As you know, you cannot move successfully along any career path if you are using. Before you attempt to create a résumé, seek out useful tools for recovery.

One such tool is relapse prevention training. Be your own advocate; ask around until you find it. Such training will help you understand the process that can lead to relapse, identify triggers, and learn coping skills to prevent relapse.

Another proven resource is http://smartrecovery.org, an excellent site that provides online mutual-help groups, an online message board, and information on face-to-face meetings around the world.

Here are three more excellent resources:

1. When AA Doesn’t Work for You: Rational Steps to Quitting Alcohol by Albert Ellis and Emmett Velten (Fort Lee, N.J.: Barricade Books, 1992).   
2. Rational Recovery: The New Cure for Substance Addiction by Jack Trimpey (New York: Pocket Books, 1996).   
3. Stay Sober and Straight: How to Prevent Addiction Relapse with the Rational Self-Help Treatment Method by Maxie Maultsby (Weirton, W.Va.: Rational Self-Help Books, 1990).

Unexplained job exits, lengthy employment gaps, and other challenging issues caused by your substance abuse are more easily explained when you are in recovery. If the résumé you send includes clear evidence of skills useful to an employer, then you may be invited to explain the issues. Think about, write, and rehearse in front of a mirror at least 100 times your three-part, sixty-second explanation to:

• Acknowledge your total responsibility for the consequences of your substance abuse.   
• Announce the period of time you have been clean—and your willingness to be tested.   
• State your determination to continue to work at it for the rest of your life to stay clean.

Many employers respect the courage it takes to say and mean such things. As a result, people in recovery who are honestly committed to staying clean are hired and thriving in the workplace every day. You can be one of them.
