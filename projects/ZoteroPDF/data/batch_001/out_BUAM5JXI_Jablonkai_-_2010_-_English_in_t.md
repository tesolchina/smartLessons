# Abstract

This study extends research into the use of English as a lingua franca in the European context by investigating the most frequent word combinations in English documents issued by EU institutions. As there is little research on the use of the English language within the European Union for ESP pedagogic purposes, as part of a larger scale analysis, the aim of this study is to explore the structures and functions of lexical bundles in English EU texts, and to draw conclusions regarding their relevance for language courses on English for EU purposes. Findings suggest that the structural and functional classification of EU lexical bundles show similarities with the language of university textbooks and academic prose in general. However, written English EU discourse applies lexical bundles in higher frequencies, which suggests that a fairly large proportion of EU texts are made up of formulaic patterns. The pedagogical implications of this study highlight the importance of explicit instruction in this type of word combination in courses on English for EU purposes.

# 1. Introduction

According to the EU language policy, all official documents should be made available in the 23 official languages of the EU (Council Regulation (EC) No. 1791/2006). In practice, however, because of time and financial constraints, documents are produced first in one, or just some of the working languages of the EU. Often EU documents are first produced in English (Truchot, 2002). English is used worldwide as the international lingua franca, especially in business contexts (Kachru, 1985; Louhiala-Salminen, Charles, & Kankaaranta, 2005; Nickerson, 2005; St John, 1996), and, increasingly, among EU member states as well. Truchot (2002) demonstrates the increase in the use of English, not only in communication between member states, but also in internal communication within EU institutions, especially in written communication. English is gaining more and more ground within the EU as the lingua franca necessitates the preparation of future EU professionals in EU member states for the use of English in an EU context. Therefore, issues such as a comprehensive analysis of the varieties of English used within the institutions of the EU, or the teaching materials for EU English courses, need to be researched.

Most studies on the use of English in EU documents have focused on aspects of language policy and translation. Only a handful of studies have explored the use of English from a language pedagogic point of view. These studies either focused on a single genre, for example, EU project proposals (Tribble, 2000), or applied a fairly small corpus in their analyses (Jablonkai, 2009; Trebits, 2008, 2009a, 2009b), and therefore failed to provide generalisable results. The present study extends research into the use of English as a lingua franca in the European context by investigating a corpus of 1 million running words of English language EU documents published by EU institutions. As a first step in the comprehensive analysis of the English language use within the European Union, this study focuses on the most frequent word combinations.

# 1.1. The study of recurrent word combinations

With the advent of computer technology and corpus linguistics, it has become possible to statistically analyse recurrent word combinations in discourse. This corpus-driven framework for the study of frequent longer word sequences was first applied in The Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999), and the term lexical bundle was created to distinguish such recurrent word sequences from other types of multi-word lexical items. Biber and Conrad (1999) defined lexical bundles as “the most frequent recurring lexical sequences; . . . which can be regarded as extended collocations: sequences of three or more words that show a statistical tendency to co-occur (e.g. in the case of the, do you want me to, I said to him)” (p. 183). The concept of lexical bundles has been used in several later studies (Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; Biber, 2009; Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Biber & Conrad, 1999; Cortes & Csomay, 2007, 2009; Hyland, 2008; Cortes, 2004) to investigate commonly used multi-word items in discourse, focusing mainly on written and spoken registers in university and academic contexts.

# 1.2. The functions and structures of lexical bundles

Research investigating lexical bundles in several registers has found that they are present in written and spoken registers alike, and they are considered “basic building blocks for constructing spoken and written discourse” (Biber & Conrad, 1999, p. 188). Moreover, further research has shown that, in certain written registers like written course management, comprising syllabi and description of course assignments, lexical bundles are surprisingly common (Biber & Barbieri, 2007). These results are in contrast to previous analyses, which regarded the use of longer word sequences as a characteristic of spoken registers (Pawley & Syder, 1983).

Previous studies have found that lexical bundles are structurally complex, usually incomplete, and not fixed (Biber & Conrad, 1999). Comparing lexical bundles across registers has shown that their grammatical structure is a distinct characteristic of all registers. The structural types of lexical bundles have been analysed and classified by Biber et al. (2004). Their framework, which is applied in the present study is described in detail in Section 3.2.

The discourse functions of lexical bundles have also been examined. By developing a detailed taxonomy, Biber et al. (2004) found that the three main functions lexical bundles serve in discourse include expressing stance, organising discourse and referring to, for example, time and place. The full taxonomy of functional categories is outlined in Section 3.2.

# 1.3. Lexical bundles in language teaching

There are only a few studies that focus on lexical bundles for language teaching purposes (Cortes, 2004, 2006; Neely & Cortes, 2009; Scott & Tribble, 2006). Most of these investigations compare student writing with professional writing in different academic disciplines. Scott and Tribble (2006), by looking at student and professional texts in literary studies, conclude that such a comparison can be helpful for students to find what they require to become proficient writers. Cortes (2004), in an examination of texts in history and biology, found that students did not often use lexical bundles, or used them in a way that is not characteristic of professional writing. In her later study, Cortes (2006) described a few tasks for the explicit teaching of lexical bundles, and analysed the effectiveness of these tasks. She concluded that having a few lessons that demonstrate some examples of lexical bundles in professional writing will not necessarily result in students using more lexical bundles in a more appropriate way; but it will increase their interest in, and awareness of, these expressions, which is a useful step towards producing texts that are acceptable to the specific discourse community.

# 1.4. Lexical bundles in written English EU discourse

Previous studies of English EU texts have focused on different aspects of the language used within the EU context. Tribble (2000), for example, analysed EU Phare project proposals in order to form the basis of instruction for writing difficult texts. Trebits (2008, 2009a, 2009b) analysed lexis in general, and conjunctions and phrasal verbs in particular, in a small corpus of official EU texts downloaded from the website of the European Union. Another study that focused on English EU discourse examined a small corpus of 120,000 running words comprising English press releases from EU institutions, and EU legal texts from the Official Journal of the European Union (Jablonkai, 2009). This study compared the lexis and lexical bundles in this small corpus of official English EU texts, and a corpus of news texts focusing on EU-related topics of similar size. Following Biber and Barbieri (2007), Jablonkai defined four-word lexical bundles, firstly, based on their frequency – with a relatively high frequency cut-off point of 40 times per million words – and secondly, by range, that is, lexical bundles had to occur in at least five individual texts. In addition a third criterion was introduced because of the nature and small size of the corpora investigated. Because the small corpus of English EU texts was comprised of the sub-corpora of press releases and legal texts, only lexical bundles occurring in both sub-corpora were included in the analysis. The examination of the lexical bundles showed that the bundle types themselves and their structures and functions, investigated on the basis of the taxonomy of Biber et al. (2004), are significantly different in the corpus of news texts on EU-related topics and in the corpus of official EU texts which shows a considerable difference in the discourse of these two EU-related registers. These findings suggest that language instruction for future EU professionals should include teaching materials that are informed by the analysis of official English EU documents.

As part of a larger scale analysis, the aim of the present study is to further explore the role and structure of lexical bundles in English EU texts. Moreover, the study intends to draw conclusions as to the relevance of lexical bundles for courses on English for EU purposes.

# 2. Research aims

The main objective of the present analysis is to identify and analyse lexical bundles in written English EU discourse in a larger corpus. Besides the identification of lexical bundles, the present study aims to analyse the structures and functions of these recurrent word combinations. These analyses hoped to reveal some of the special characteristics of written English EU discourse which, with the help of the list of EU lexical bundles, can serve as a starting point for designing courses and tasks for teaching purposes. This study was guided by the following particular research questions:

1. What lexical bundles occur in written English EU discourse?   
2. What are the main characteristics of EU lexical bundles in terms of structure and function in written English EU documents?   
3. What pedagogical implications do the findings have for courses on English for EU purposes?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. The English EU Discourse Corpus

Corpus building for this study was preceded by a needs analysis survey among EU professionals to garner information about the types of documents they use in their jobs (Jablonkai, 2008). The results of the questionnaire survey were then used for selecting relevant EU genres and texts for the final corpus. As the study aims to identify characteristics of written English EU discourse in general, and not one specific EU subject field in particular, efforts were made to balance the corpus for the different subject fields of EU activities such as monetary policy, economy, agriculture, and regional policy. There were altogether $3 4 ~ \mathrm { E U }$ subject fields defined, based on the list of EU policies available on the official website of the EU (http://europa.eu/pol/index_- en.htm). As the main purpose of the study is to represent the use of the English language within the European Union, only texts published by an EU institution (e.g., the Commission, the Parliament or the Council) were included.

As shown in Table 1, the final corpus contains 1174,753 running words from 241 written texts representing 40 different EU genres grouped into four categories based on their specific purpose within the EU. The corpus comprises whole texts, the majority $( 9 4 \% )$ of which were published between 2000 and 2008; $5 \%$ of the texts were issued in the 1990s, and there are a few texts $( 1 \% )$ from the 1980s. On the whole, the final English EU Discourse Corpus (EEUD Corpus) represents an overall view of written English EU discourse, and was therefore found to be suitable for identifying relevant linguistic aspects for courses on English for EU purposes.

# 3.2. Tools and procedures of analysis

This study focuses on the analysis of four-word lexical bundles for two reasons. One is that most studies of lexical bundles analyse bundles with four words, and therefore lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus can be compared to bundles in other registers such as university or academic registers (Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Biber et al., 2004; Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008). Furthermore, as Cortes (2004) also argues, three-word lexical bundles are often part of four-word bundles, and four-word bundles are more frequent and give more variety for structural and functional analysis than five-word bundles.

As regards the procedures of the analysis, firstly, four-word lexical items were identified by the Cluster function of Wordsmith Tools 4 (Scott, 2004). Next, high frequency lexical bundles were selected from the automatically identified four-word lexical items using the following criteria: (1) the four-word lexical items must recur at least 40 times per million words (Biber & Barbieri, 2007), and (2) the four-word lexical items must occur in at least $10 \%$ of all texts in the corpus, that is, in 24 different texts of the EEUD Corpus (Biber & Barbieri, 2007;

a Number of texts for each genre is provided in brackets.

Cortes, 2006; Hyland, 2008). The first criterion is used to select frequent four-word lexical items, and the second criterion was introduced to avoid the impact of idiosyncratic language use by individual authors or certain institutions.

There were additional corpora used in the comparison of EU lexical bundles to lexical bundles of other registers. These were the written part of the BNC Sampler and the three written sub-corpora of the BNC Baby, namely, academic, fiction and news. Although each corpus contains a different number of texts, all corpora comprise around one million running words, which makes the comparison of their discourses more accurate. In order to give the analysis a comparable sample of lexical bundles, the frequency criterion to select lexical bundles had to be lowered. Therefore, a four-word sequence was considered a lexical bundle for the comparison if it occurred more than 20 times in the corpus and in at least $10 \%$ of the texts, but in no less than five texts.

The qualitative analysis of the identified lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus included their structural and functional analysis. The structural analysis applied the structural types of lexical bundle identified by Biber et al. (2004). According to this classification, there are three main structural types which include: (1) lexical bundles that incorporate verb phrase fragments like that’s one of the, is based on the, (2) lexical bundles that incorporate dependent clause fragments like that this is a, to come up with, and (3) lexical bundles that incorporate noun phrase and prepositional phrase fragments like at the end of, at the same time. Each main structural type entails several sub-types, as illustrated in Table 2.

In the functional analysis, the taxonomy of discourse functions of lexical bundles outlined by Biber et al. (2004) was applied. According to this taxonomy, lexical bundles serve three main discourse functions in texts: (1) stance bundles express attitude or assessment, (2) discourse organisers reflect the relationships between different parts of texts and (3) referential expressions refer to physical or abstract entities, or to other textual parts. Each of these main categories has several sub-categories which are associated with more specific discourse functions. The main discourse function categories with their sub-categories, as developed by Biber et al. (2004), are shown in Table 3.

For the analysis of the discourse functions of the lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus, the Concordance function of the Wordsmith Tools (Scott, 2004) was used. The software provided the context by concordance lists, and the functions the lexical bundles in question performed were analysed manually in consultation with an independent ESP researcher.

# 4. Lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus

Altogether, 247 lexical bundle types were identified in the EEUD Corpus. The full list of lexical bundle types is provided in Supplementary material 1. As demonstrated in Table 4, the most frequently occurring bundle types, for example, in accordance with the, of the European Union and referred to in Article, occurred more than 600 times per million words, with the most frequent lexical bundle type occurring 783 times per million words. These bundle types are used in a wide-range of EU texts in the EEUD Corpus. Many of them are used in nearly half of all the texts in the corpus. As many as 89 $( 3 6 \% )$ out of the 247 lexical bundle types occur in at least half of the 40 different EU genres, and are also used in at least half of the 34 EU-related subject fields. The least frequent lexical bundle types occur 47 times in the corpus, which corresponds to the 40 per million cut-off point, and are used in 47 EU texts. Lexical bundle types, for example in the course of, the principle of subsidiarity and the exchange of information, are some examples of these. Lexical bundle types with the lowest range are used in 24 of the 241 EU texts in the EEUD Corpus, for instance, of the internal market, the procedure referred to and within the scope of.

Comparing the number and frequency of lexical bundles in different registers shows that EU texts use by far the most lexical bundle types – slightly more than double the number of lexical bundle types in academic prose – and these lexical bundles are used very frequently in EU texts. As can be seen in Table 5, the total number of cases of lexical bundles in EU texts is six times greater than in academic prose, around 10 times greater than in fiction and in a general English corpus, and almost 20 times greater than in news texts. It suggests that the language used in EU documents is very formulaic. However, the findings of the comparison should be regarded with caution as the EEUD Corpus represents several EU registers and contains a greater variety of texts and genres than the corpora of the BNC Baby, which could be the reason for the wide variety of bundle types.

# 4.1. Structural analysis of lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus

The analysis of the grammatical structures was based on the taxonomy of Biber et al. (2004). A few new categories were added to the original types in order to classify bundles which incorporated structures that had not been recognised in earlier research. A new sub-type was added to the categories of lexical bundle incorporating dependent clause fragments. The new sub-type was created for adverbial clauses based on Biber et al. (1999), who identified four such lexical bundles, namely, as shown in figure, as we have seen, as we shall see and if there is a. The lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus with a similar structure and, therefore, classified as lexical bundles incorporating adverbial clause are, for example, as set out in, as referred to in.

There were two main structural types added. These are bundles incorporating adjectives and adverbs, on the one hand, and lexical bundles with numbers only, on the other. Numbers in the lexical bundles are replaced by the # sign following the practice of earlier studies (e.g., Forchini & Murphy, 2008). Examples of the first type include, for instance, European Economic and Social for the adjective sub-type and in so far as for the adverb sub-type. The main structural type with numbers was divided further into a sub-type of lexical bundles incorporating numbers only, for example in # and # and (frequency: 68) and others with numbers and prepositions like # of the EC (frequency: 111), # EC of the (frequency: 121) and and # of the (frequency: 163). Although there are altogether only five lexical bundle types incorporating numbers only, most of them occur rather frequently (as shown in brackets) with the most frequent being # and # of, with a frequency of 271. Similarly, a comparison of the 30 most frequently used four-word lexical items in the BNC and the Financial Times corpus, found that there is a high frequency of four-word lexical items with numbers in the Financial Times corpus because of its specialised financial subject matter (Forchini & Murphy, 2008). In the EEUD Corpus, however, these numbers very often refer to the numbers of articles or paragraphs in legal texts, as shown in the example:

The means which OLAF has at its disposal for the purpose of pursuing those objectives are specifically listed, notably in Articles 4, 7 and 9 of the regulation.

As shown in Fig. 1, most lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus contain noun phrases and prepositional phrases. Table 6 gives an overview of all structural types of the lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus with the new types and sub-types shaded. As can be seen, there are 198 bundles of this type which corresponds to $80 \%$ of all bundle types in the EEUD Corpus. Examples of this type include Committee of the Regions, proposal from the Commission, the entry into force and on behalf of the.

On the whole, it may be claimed that written English EU discourse exhibits features of written technical types of texts in that it applies an abundance of lexical bundles incorporating noun phrases and prepositional phrases. However, it makes use of a relatively high number of lexical bundles with verb phrases which seems to be in contrast to earlier findings of written registers, as Biber (2006, 2009) found that academic prose does not use lexical bundles with verb phrases at all, and textbooks only use a few of them. In the EEUD Corpus the lexical bundles with verb phrases account for almost $10 \%$ of all bundle types. As shown in Table 6, slightly fewer than half of these incorporate verb phrases with non-passive verbs, and a slight majority is composed of verb phrases with passive verbs.

# 4.2. Functional analysis of lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus

The functional analysis of the lexical bundles identified in the EEUD Corpus used a revised version of the taxonomy of Biber et al. (2004). A few new categories needed to be added to the framework in order to classify bundles which performed functions that had not been identified earlier in academic registers. Several of the newly added categories, however, have been created based on the analysis of a smaller EU Corpus (Jablonkai, 2009), and have been found useful in the investigation of the EEUD Corpus as well. These categories were the additional main category ‘subject-specific’, which has already been applied in previous studies of lexical bundles under different terms, such as ‘subject-bound bundles’ (Cortes, 2004), ‘context-dependent bundles’ (Cortes, 2008) or ‘research-oriented topic bundles’ (Hyland, 2008), and two sub-categories of referential bundles, namely, ‘quality specification’ and ‘intertextual’. The category of subject-specific bundles was added following Hyland’s (2008) classification and Cortes’s (2008) context-dependent category. Hyland introduced the category of lexical bundles that are related to the actual field of research, and Cortes found that there are bundles that contain content words which are related to the topic of the texts in her history corpus. In a similar way, the category subject-specific in this study was created for lexical bundles that refer to, for example, organisations or documents relating to the European Union. On the basis of the entities they refer to, the main category was divided into four sub-categories, such as organisations, documents, codes and other. A detailed description of these sub-categories of subject-specific bundles will follow in Section 4.2.4.

Here, the new sub-categories will be explained and illustrated by examples from the EEUD Corpus. One of these sub-categories was introduced for lexical bundles that express attributes of quality, consequently this sub-category, called ‘quality specification’, was added to the main category of referential bundles specifying certain attributes. The following sentence illustrates bundles of this type:

The aim of the programme shall be to contribute to the protection of children, young people and women against all forms of violence and to attain a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion.

The other sub-category that has already been found useful for the analysis of EU texts (Jablonkai, 2009) is the intertextual referential bundle. This category was created for bundles which do not refer to parts within the same text, as text-deixis bundles (Biber et al., 2004), but make reference to a different text, which is very often another piece of EU legislation. The following sentence illustrates intertextual bundles:

The Community funds thus distributed shall be administered by the national agencies provided for in Article $\delta ( 2 ) ( b )$ .

The third additional sub-category of the category of referential bundles for lexical bundles expressing the purpose of certain acts or documents is called ‘purpose’, and is illustrated by the following sentence:

In order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in this Article:

The results of the functional analysis of lexical bundles identified in the EEUD Corpus applying the revised taxonomy with the additional categories are given in Table 7 with the new categories shaded.

As can be seen in Fig. 2, most of the lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus are referential bundles, specifying several attributes like quantity, quality, purpose, time, place, etc. The second largest group of bundles is related to the European Union, and they thus make up the category of subject-specific bundles. Finally, there are only a few lexical bundles in the current corpus that express stance or serve as discourse organisers.

# 4.2.1. Stance bundles in the EEUD Corpus

There were only nine stance bundles identified in the EEUD Corpus. All of these belong to the category of impersonal stance bundles, that is, they do not use personal pronouns. The stance functions desire, intention and ability do not seem to be expressed with lexical bundles in the texts of the EEUD Corpus. Instead, bundles are used for expressing the functions epistemic and attitudinal stance and importance. There is only one epistemic stance bundle (the fact that the), there are six bundles expressing obligation (the Commission shall be, shall enter into force, shall ensure that the, on the Commission to, shall be subject to, the Member States shall), and two that express importance $i t$ is necessary to, be taken into account). The impersonal epistemic bundle, also noted by Biber et al. (2004), expresses the degree of certainty, as in:

Fig. 2. Functional distribution of lexical bundle types in the EEUD Corpus.

The fact that the conversion loss is not included gives biomass an unfair advantage over wind and solar energy.

Obligation bundles give directions, as in this example:

The Authority shall ensure that the public and any interested parties are rapidly given objective, reliable and easily accessible information, in particular with regard to the results of its work.

Finally, importance bundles show how important the following proposition is, as illustrated in this example:

For a meaningful discussion on how to frame lobbying at EU level, it is necessary to define the basic framework on which the relationship between the EU institutions and lobbyists should be built.

# 4.2.2. Discourse organisers in the EEUD Corpus

Findings show that the function of discourse organising lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus is topic elaboration and clarification. These bundles are often used to provide additional sources, clarification or comparison, and contrast in the EEUD Corpus. The following sentences from the EEUD Corpus exemplify these uses of discourse organising bundles in an EU context:

In addition to the above considerations, the following should be noted:

Recommendation 98/376/EC is amended as set out in the Annex.

# 4.2.3. Referential bundles in the EEUD Corpus

The majority of lexical bundles identify entities, or give particular attributes, that is, they function as referential bundles in different written registers. Referential bundles have been found to be the largest category in corpora of textbooks and academic prose (Biber et al., 2004). As regards their functions, most of the lexical bundles identified in this study also belong to the category of referential bundles. As can be seen in Fig. 3, intangible framing bundles with 46 bundle types, time bundles with 25 bundle types, intertextual bundles with 22 bundle types, and focus bundles with 21 bundle types are among the most common functional categories of referential lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus. Among the sub-categories of referential bundles, intertextual, quality, and purpose bundles appear to be specific to EU texts, as these have not been identified in earlier analyses. Lexical bundles in these additional categories are described and illustrated in Section 4.2. Bundles in the new intertextual category refer to other texts. The functional category text-deixis, however, includes bundles that refer to different parts of the same text. Previous research has found text-deixis bundles frequently in extbooks and academic prose (Biber et al., 2004). The following sentence provides an example of a text-deixis bundle in the EEUD Corpus:

![](img/ea03d859f3617af56b196f171878158d7a287dbe550e25ce5eac61167da43098.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Distribution of referential lexical bundle types across sub-categories.

The implementing rules for paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(3).

Lexical bundles most often provide an intangible frame for propositions in the EEUD Corpus. These bundles specify abstract frames, and are used to establish logical frames and relationships in EU texts, as illustrated in the following example:

In the absence of opposition, the European Council may adopt the decision.

Tangible framing bundles, however, describe concrete size and form:

The Member State of refund shall take into account as a decrease or increase of the amount of the refund any correction made concerning a previous refund application in accordance with Article 13 or, where a separate declaration is submitted, in the form of separate payment or recovery.

Focus bundles in the EEUD Corpus are used to identify sub-groups of people or countries that are in focus, or identify certain pieces of EU legislation as particularly relevant:

In such a case, the Member State concerned shall provide additional information concerning that measure or decision, within two weeks of a request being made through the network.

The second most frequently performed function of lexical bundles in EU texts in the EEUD Corpus is reference to time. Time is referred to in bundles as dates, periods, or in general as the end or time of certain events:

On this basis, the EU-Ukraine Action Plan was adopted in February 2005 for a period of three years.

There are fewer bundles referring to the places of co-operation or other activities, and the publication of different information.

Biber et al. (2004) identified a functional sub-category of lexical bundles, called multi-functional, that serve more than one function in texts. Depending on the context these bundles refer to time, place, and/or different parts of the text. There were only three lexical bundle types found to express several things in different contexts in the EEUD Corpus. The two sentences below show that the same lexical bundle refers to the date in the first example, and to the topic in the second:

The conference declares that the decision relating to the implementation of Article 16(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be adopted by the Council on the date of the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon and will enter into force on the day that Treaty enters into force.

The Commission will inform the European Parliament and the Council on the outcome. Finally, the only lexical bundle in the EEUD Corpus that refers to quantity, and therefore classified under the quantity specification category, is the one shown below. More often than not, lexical bundles of the quantity specification category refer to nouns from the field of finance like cost, expenditure, refund, budgetary resources, and so forth

The checks carried out for the period 2000–2006 shall cover at least $1 5 \%$ of the total eligible expenditure incurred on projects first approved during that period.

# 4.2.4. Subject-specific bundles in the EEUD Corpus

The functional category, subject-specific, is a new category comprising lexical bundles that are related to the subject field of the texts, in this case, to the European Union. There are four sub-categories based on the entities the lexical bundles refer to. Lexical bundles in the first and most common sub-category, organisations, refer to countries and institutions, especially member states and EU bodies like the Commission, the Council, and the Economic and Social Committee, as shown in the example below:

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,

As shown in Fig. 4, the second largest sub-category with 17 different bundle types is documents includin lexical bundles that refer to EU documents like treaties, the Official Journal, or proposals:

They shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union if the texts in the present languages were so published.

The sub-category codes contains lexical bundles that specify certain articles and paragraphs of EU texts, as shown in the following example:

Article 5 of the EC Treaty thereof as interpreted by Protocol No. 30 on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, namely, its Point 9.

Finally, there is a sub-category, other, including lexical bundles expressing important EU-related concepts:

A. whereas, in accordance with the Treaties, the Community is called upon to play an active role in the field of health, whilst complying with the principle of subsidiarity,

# 4.3. Pedagogical implications

The distributional patterns and general characteristics of lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus have several implications for ESP pedagogy. Firstly, the structural analysis of lexical bundles found that certain verb phrases, and noun and prepositional phrases, are prevalent in the EEUD Corpus, therefore, these grammatical structures, for example, noun phrases with an of-phrase fragment, prepositional phrases and verb phrases with passive verbs, should be given more emphasis in teaching practice. Secondly, the functional analysis revealed that nearly a third of the lexical bundles refer to EU-specific entities. Therefore, they can be used to compile glossaries of useful terms for students. Finally, it was generally found that lexical bundles occur very frequently in the EEUD Corpus. Therefore, explicit instruction in these recurrent word combinations may increase the efficiency of courses and teaching materials for English for EU purposes. The explicit teaching of lexical bundles in written English EU discourse should: (1) raise students’ awareness of lexical bundles, (2) focus on the function of lexical bundles, and (3) provide examples and practice of usage patterns of lexical bundles (Cortes, 2004, 2006; Neely & Cortes, 2009; Trebits, 2009a). In awareness raising tasks, students should be provided with excerpts from EU texts with the lexical bundles highlighted, as illustrated in Task 1 in Supplementary material 2. Based on these excerpts, students can draw conclusions on the relevance of lexical bundles in EU texts, and can also identify the functions of the specific bundles. The next step should be to expand on the different functions lexical bundles can have in EU texts. Most bundles in the EEUD Corpus appear to make reference to physical or abstract entities as referential bundles, therefore tasks concentrating on referential bundles should be included in a syllabus of English for EU purposes. Task 2 in Supplementary material 2 presents two ways to provide students with practice in using referential bundles. In the first part, students are given concordance lines of specific bundles and they are asked to identify the functions they have in the given contexts. In a follow-up “fill-in-the-blank” exercise, students should complete sentences with the lexical bundles that perform the functions specified in brackets. Finally, concordance lines can also be used to provide students with examples of the usage patterns of certain lexical bundles. Task 3 in Supplementary material 2 focuses on the most frequent lexical bundle type in the EEUD Corpus, that is, in accordance with the. Students should study how this lexical bundle is used in a sentence, what words are likely to precede and follow it, and where they are usually placed within the sentence. These tasks provide examples of how the findings of the present corpus-driven study can be used in the ESP classroom. The tasks are useful not only for writing purposes, but they also help students comprehend and interpret EU texts in the correct way.

# 5. Conclusions

The present study aimed to identify and analyse lexical bundles in written English EU discourse, applying a corpus-driven approach. Although the structural and functional classification of lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus revealed some similarities with the language of textbooks and academic prose, on the whole, written English EU discourse seems to differ from other written registers in a number of important aspects. Firstly, as regards the structure of lexical bundles in the EEUD Corpus, findings show that EU texts make use of a higher number of bundles with verb phrases. Secondly, lexical bundles appear in fairly high frequencies in the EEUD Corpus, which suggests that a substantial proportion of EU texts consist of formulaic patterns. The differing nature of lexical bundles in written English EU discourse makes it important to raise students’ awareness of these differences compared to general English use in specialised courses on English for EU purposes. It should be noted, however, that the large number of different bundle types in the EEUD Corpus could be the result of the wide variety of different EU genres that are included in the corpus. Therefore, further research should concentrate on how the lexical bundles identified in this study are distributed in the different EU genres. Moreover, lexical bundles specific to individual EU genres should also be identified. In addition, as the findings of the study only refer to written English communication within the EU context, further research on spoken communication within EU institutions is still required in order to identify the structural and functional characteristics of word sequences common to this form of discourse. Such a comprehensive analysis may provide a more coherent picture of English language use within an EU context for course and materials design for teaching English for EU purposes.
