# Abstract

Factors such as increases in student numbers and technological developments are threatening the luxury of one-on-one tutorials and bringing changes in modes of academic discourse. This small scale exploratory study identifies characteristics of taped oral, compared to written, feedback that are attributable to its spoken nature (longer, less dense); to the shift away from multiple audiences (more engaged, more personal); to its more formative purpose (greater range of feedback strategies, focus on product and process); and to the communicative context (opening moves that involve the audience more; summary moves that rephrase and focus). Salient linguistic features of the taped oral feedback genre are described, and it is argued that the shift from written to taped oral feedback naturally brings with it more extensive feedback that engages more with the writer, has a more formative purpose, and is more explicit. Implications for EAP and all those providing feedback on student work are suggested.

# 1. Introduction

Increasing student numbers, developments in technology, and policy shifts towards greater accountability and standardisation across universities have contributed to mode change away from small group academic speech events, such as tutorials or seminars, in higher education. Linguistic analyses of face-to-face seminars in contrast to the computer-based tutorials that are replacing them highlight, for instance, the increasing standardisation of pedagogic discourse, curriculum, evaluation, and of the texts themselves (Wickens, 2000: 280–293). Such research on the effects of mode change on academic events contributes not only to our understanding of academic events per se, but also to our pedagogical practice in EAP and mainstream academic contexts.

Here I examine feedback on academic term papers by comparing taped oral comments given by two tutors with written comments given by the same tutors on similar assignments. The data were collected as part of a project to examine the effectiveness of taped-oral feedback in an applied linguistics MA course for teachers of English internationally. Similar studies have investigated the use of taped-oral feedback with first and second language writers; with students of different proficiency levels; for a range of different purposes from reader-response to teacher assessment; in different classes from ESL and EAP to content areas; and in different contexts: small classes, large classes, groups of classes and distance courses (Alexander, 1999; Allan, 1991; Boswood & Dwyer, 1995; Hunt, 1989; Hyland, 1990; Kirschner, 1991; McAlpine, 1989; Patrie, 1989). In general the technique has been found to be efficient and worthwhile, to be valued by students and tutors, and to be particularly effective for feedback in some areas of writing—discourse, reader response, sense of audience, social context—rather than others such as correction of syntax or punctuation. Much has also been learned about effective implementation (e.g., Boswood & Dwyer, 1995). My concern here however is not the effectiveness of the technique or the practicalities of implementation, but rather the impact of mode change on the academic discourse.

# 1.1. Initial comparisons between taped-oral and written feedback

An initial comparison of the written and spoken feedback revealed that there were changes associated with the mode; moreover, these were related to changes in audience and purpose. Thus where comments were written to the student as primary audience, they were also written for the second marker, external examiner and teaching quality inspector. In contrast, the taped-oral feedback was construed as more private discourse, less likely to be listened to by further examiners, and thus more personally addressed to the student. This in turn means that the taped feedback was more obviously formative in nature, while the written feedback was more explicitly justified by external criteria and for secondary audiences. This paper explores the features which realise these changes in mode, audience and purpose.

# 1.2. Data

The analysis focuses on four examples of taped-oral feedback which have been chosen as examples of feedback by two tutors (here called Jay and Kay) on different A and C papers, each of which was on a similar topic (methodology). These were selected with the help of the two tutors who identified the papers (not the feedback) as typical A and C papers. Future studies might include analysis of more tapes from more tutors. The four taped-oral examples are compared with each other, and with written feedback selected as appropriate to the analysis: thus they are compared with all written feedback on A and C papers from a similar module by the same tutor for length comparisons (Section 2.1); and with feedback with the most comments on a particular aspect (e.g. referencing conventions) for comparisons of feedback strategies used (Section 2.3.8). The option of comparing written and spoken comments by the same tutors on the same assignments was ruled out as artificial in that the second set of comments would be rehearsed and have a research rather than an authentic purpose. Although differences can be observed between the two tutors, and the variable of tutor style is important—Ivanic, Clark, and Rimmershaw (1994: 5) identify nine different styles in their data—the analysis here focuses on differences across modes.

# 2. Analysis and findings

The analysis attempts to capture the differences in mode by highlighting linguistic differences from a range of perspectives that characterise first spoken vs. written discourse in general (Section 2.1); then tenor through audience construction (Section 2.2); thirdly purpose through a comparison of the actual feedback strategies used (Section 2.3); and finally genre through typical move sequences attributable to the taped-oral context (Section 2.4).

# 2.1. Spoken vs. written language

Differences between spoken and written language can be explained in terms of complexity: ‘The complexity of the written language is static and dense. That of the spoken language is dynamic and intricate. Grammatical intricacy takes the place of lexical density.’ (Halliday, 1989: 87). Table 1 gives examples of the expanding, intricate development of clause complexes typical of the spoken feedback, and shows how feedback with similar aims is expressed differently in spoken and written modes.

Table 1 Comparison of spoken and written feedback   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Taped-oral feedback</td><td>Written feedback by same tutor</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You say that speaking and writing are both productive and yet there are many differences but you don&#x27;t explain exactly what the differences are (TO-C-K-17)</td><td>You need to explain this further.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Now according to the conventions we have at [our university], you&#x27;re not really supposed to put people in your bibliography if you haven&#x27;t referred to them in the text (TO-C-J-15)</td><td>Provide a date and page number, not title.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>But I would have like a few specific examples of how these routines eh kind of look like what these routines do just to show that you understand what information interaction routines eh are and how knowledge of routines could be helpful when eh speaking (TO-C-K-86)</td><td>Examples?</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 2 Ratios of length of taped-oral to written feedback   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Tutor J</td><td>Tutor J</td><td>Tutor K</td><td>Tutor K</td></tr><tr><td>Grade of paper</td><td>A</td><td>c</td><td>A</td><td>c</td></tr><tr><td>Taped oral feedback</td><td>944 words (n=1)</td><td>2085 words(n=1)</td><td>1422 words (n=1)</td><td>2691 words (n=1)</td></tr><tr><td>Written feedback (average)</td><td>153 words (n=3)</td><td>178 words (n=3)</td><td>208 words (n=3)</td><td>341 words (n=4)</td></tr><tr><td>Taped-oral to written ratio</td><td>944/153 = 6.2 to 1</td><td>2085/178 = 11.7 to 1</td><td>1422/208 = 6.8 to 1</td><td>2691/341 = 7.9 to 1</td></tr></table></body></html>

The spoken language of the feedback has the intricate, flowing clause complexes described by Halliday, where the written comments here are essentially unrelated clause simplexes and minor clauses. There are longer written clause complexes (e.g. Section 2.3.8 below) but they seldom go beyond a three-clause complex. Table 2 provides a simple measure of this length in words in comparable data sets, namely the length in words of the taped feedback on the A and C papers, and, for comparison, the average length in words of written feedback on all the A and C papers by the same tutors from an equivalent module.

Here the spoken feedback is typically around seven times longer than the written feedback, with more feedback given on weaker papers in both cases.

# 2.2. Audience construction

In addition to differences in length, density and intricacy, it emerges that the tutors construct their audiences differently in the two modes. Feedback on referencing conventions on two C papers with similar problems is given in Table 3 to illustrate the differences. The feedback is addressed to two different students, but the messages are similar. In both cases the tutor is directing the student to follow the referencing conventions (which had already been explained to the students in writing and in class, and practised by the students in a trial assignment). In the familiar written genre, the tutor asserts her authority through the use of must and bald infinitives. The audience is distanced by the formal, more precise approach, which produces feedback that would be instantly recognisable to additional markers. In contrast, the less familiar taped-oral genre elicits a mixture of high, median and low obligation (Halliday, 1994: 360), which is influenced by the specific piece of writing and student, but is also, I argue, a consequence of mode change. Taped-oral feedback is more like a face-to-face encounter, where ‘must is almost always replaced by the less confrontational should’ (Hyland, 2002: 228) and where disagreement tends to be less forceful (Mulkay, 1985 cited in McCarthy & Carter, 1994: 123).

In the spoken mode it is also natural to use more hedging (really) and personal pronouns (I, you). A comparison of pronouns in Subject position of non-embedded clauses showed $50 \%$ 2nd person subjects in the spoken feedback compared with $20 \%$ in the written, with $1 0 \%$ 1st person subjects in each case, leaving $40 \%$ of 3rd person subjects in spoken mode, compared to $70 \%$ in written mode. The use of personal pronouns and hedging are features that have been identified as promoting increased engagement with the audience in academic writing (e.g., Hyland, 2002: 15). In a similar way they function here to reduce the level of formality and create greater personal involvement with the student. This change positions the audience of taped-oral feedback not simply as someone who is being formally instructed, but in more complex ways.

Table 3 Comparison of obligation in advice on referencing   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Advice</td><td>Taped-oral feedback</td><td>Written feedback</td></tr><tr><td>Obligation high</td><td>1. Now whenever you mention a reference it must be there in your 1. Remember that every bibliography 2. If you&#x27;ve read about that writer in another source you need to say quoted in 3. But you do need to be careful about em particulars or the details of referencing 4. Em and the secret is if you want to show the range of your reading to make sure that you do mention all the references that</td><td>author you refer to in your text must be included in your bibliography 2. Provide a date and page number, not title</td></tr><tr><td>median</td><td>Obligation 6. Now according to the conventions we have at (our university), you&#x27;re not really supposed to put people in your bibliography if you haven&#x27;t referred to them in the text. 7. And Richards&#x27; book J.C. Richards should be there 8. This is a piece of work from the first term but by the second term and certainly by the time you get to your dissertation these shouldn&#x27;t any longer be problems</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>low</td><td>Obligation 9. It may be that you could quote a sentence or that you could use an activity or that you could mention an example which comes from one of these sources and then you can put the source and the date in the body of the text.</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 3 illustrates how the taped-oral feedback engages the student by giving general advice on the process (3, 5), and by explaining the professional tricks of the trade (4, 9), with various face-saving strategies such as objective marking of obligation (according to the conventions at [our university]), hedging (it may be that you could . . .), and framing the comments in a developmental context (8). Through the taped-oral feedback, the students get the impression that the tutor cares, understands, and has read the paper carefully in a way that enables her to point the way forward in process and product terms. This constructs the student more as an apprentice (cf Wells, 1994) and—not withstanding arguments elsewhere (Rea-Dickins & Gardner, 2000) that the distinctions between formative and summative assessment are not as straightforward as sometimes portrayed—this constructs the tutor as engaged in assessment and evaluation of a more formative nature.

Table 4 Appraisal instances in taped-oral and written feedback   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Appreciation</td><td>Affect</td><td> Judgement</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Taped oral</td><td>2 A grade</td><td>52</td><td>6</td><td>41</td><td>99 (40%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2 C grade</td><td>54</td><td>4</td><td>21</td><td>79 (32%)</td></tr><tr><td>Written</td><td>2 A grade</td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>13</td><td>31 (13%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2 C grade</td><td>20</td><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>36 (15%)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>140 (57%)</td><td>17 (7%)</td><td>88 (36%)</td><td>245 (100%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Numbers reflect sum of appraisals in feedback on two papers in each case (e.g. taped oral feedback on 2 A grade papers, taped oral feedback on $2 \mathrm { C }$ grade papers).

Further linguistic evidence to suggest that the tutor is more personally involved in the interaction in the taped-oral feedback is found in the more extensive use of the appraisal resources in general, and judgement in particular. Following Martin (2000: 145–146), judgement construes moral evaluations of behaviour, whereas appreciation construes the aesthetic quality of the semiotic text and affect construes emotional response. Judgements on the writer’s behaviour included social sanction (I agree with you; you’re right) as well as social esteem (that’s sensible; you do that well/wisely/better; you need to make clearer/easier/be more careful). Examples of appreciation, also from the spoken data, include comments on the quality (good, fine), value (important, useful), balance of composition (wide range, too brief) and complexity of composition (clear, detailed, too general, vague). Affect includes what the tutors liked, what they were impressed by or appreciated, and once where they found the ideas fun.

As Table 4 suggests, the main function of the feedback continues to be evaluation of the text [140 $( 5 7 \% )$ of the total 245 appraisals]. The spoken data is marked by a higher incidence (41: 21) of judgement on the A vs. C papers (you have read widely); whereas the written data is marked by more (20: 14) appreciation on C vs. A papers (some references do not appear in your bibliography). Interestingly, Hyland and Hyland define praise as ‘an act which attributes credit to another for some characteristic, attribute, skill, etc. which is positively valued. . .’ and criticism as ‘an expression of dissatisfaction or negative comment’ on a text (Hyland, 2000: 44) (2001: 186, italics added), reinforcing a tendency to praise the person and criticise the text. This distances the writer from his or her poor quality work, but by judging the writer of the better work, the tutors set up a stronger interpersonal bond with the writers of A papers, particularly in the spoken feedback.

# 2.3. Types of feedback strategy

This section of the analysis begins with a focus on the strategies used to give explicit advice or suggestions. In the four tapes extensive explicit advice and/or suggestion is given in the following area shown in Table 5.

In itself this is interesting. The nature of the themes suggests that explicit advice is more likely to be given on the technical aspects of writing. Praise and criticism of the ideas in the papers were plenty, but the particular ideas were not generally the focus of explicit advice or suggestion. Where such suggestions did occur, however, they tended to point the way forward in a more mentoring than teacher-like manner:

Table 5 Themes of explicit advice and suggestion in taped feedback   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Tutor Jaye</td><td>Tutor Kay</td></tr><tr><td>A grade</td><td>. Include a conclusion, even if it takes you. over the word limit.</td><td>. Use your own words, don&#x27;t just quote others</td></tr><tr><td>C grade</td><td>. Balance explanation and examples . Relate what you write to the question. . Use referencing conventions</td><td>. Organisation and signposting</td></tr></table></body></html>

At another time you might like to delve more deeply into the use of reflective writing in children’s portfolio work as I think you would find this very interesting and useful (W-A-J).

This raises issues for discussion: do we give more explicit advice on areas that are easy to advise on and easy to fix? The literature suggests two very different perspectives on this. On the one hand, we see the positive view of this put forward as received wisdom:

. . .writing is both free and constrained—both highly creative in that the next sentence is always a surprise and also highly conventional in that all writers work within a limited, describable syntactic repertoire and a set of culturally determined, widely recognized genres; that the conventions act as constraints but also as heuristics, making the possible certain kinds of creative work at both the sentence and text levels, especially for developing writers. (Cooper & Odell, 1999: 2, italics added).

The social-constructivist theory that supports this view is clearly outlined in Candlin and Hyland (1999: 15). From this point of view the tutors are providing the scaffolding needed to assist apprentice writers in mastering academic discourse.

From a more critical perspective we see Chouliaraki arguing that where procedural types of knowledge are privileged over principled ones, we ‘produce pedagogic subjects who are oriented towards executing secretarial tasks, rather than developing autonomy and creativity in their learning’ (Chouliaraki, 1998: 5). I am not suggesting that procedural types of knowledge are privileged by the tutors in the present study, nor that non-native speakers are unable to interpret the suggestions and advice implicit in praise and critique moves (although there will be cases where this may happen—as documented in Hyland & Hyland, 2001). Nevertheless, most explicit advice given relates to referencing and organisation, and these have therefore been chosen as topic foci for this section. Of these, referencing could certainly be labelled a secretarial task—which is not to imply that it is unimportant.

Analysis of all the feedback related to referencing and organisation (not only explicit advice and suggestion) revealed eight different strategies. Examples are given of each type and this is followed by a summary table that shows strategy use across tutors, modes, grades and topics.

# 2.3.1. Strategy A: giving explicit detailed suggestions or advice

The analysis of moves and of advice (Gardner, 1999a, 2001) distinguishes between suggestions, which are specific to the paper being written, and advice, which could be more generally applied. An example of advice on referencing is:

now whenever you mention a reference it must be there in your bibliography (TO-C-J-75).

An example of a suggestion on organisation is:

em so I think that it would have been better right after the quote from Nunan em if you had included a couple of sentences on the structure of the essay and then inserted another section perhaps em speech versus writing and then discussed the eh differences (TO-C-K-9).

This strategy of giving explicit, detailed suggestions or advice was found equally in spoken and written feedback, although as we have seen above (Sections 2.1 and 2.2) the linguistic realisations vary significantly with the mode. The spoken discourse lends itself more easily to the unpacking of nominalisations and technical feeedback terms in the marking criteria, such as ‘follow recommended referencing conventions’, ‘demonstrate understanding’ or ‘critical discussion of the issues.’ Such unpacking is found in praise and critique moves, and also in the detailed suggestions that relate to the student’s work (e.g. Table 1, point 3). Indeed, Young and Nguyen (2002: 368) in their comparison of textbook and teacher explanations in high school science suggest that it is the unpacking of nominalisations and technical terms that is the most significant linguistic feature in making the message in the spoken mode more accessible.

2.3.2. Strategy B: pointing out omissions In the spoken feedback, omissions are usually preceded by some kind of alerter:

and Richards book—J.C. Richards — should be there (TO-C-J-83) em in Roberts you cite their specific examples on how to open conversations but you don’t give the page number (TO-A-K-36).

In contrast, in the written feedback, omissions are often bald statements, questions or queries:

Statements: You haven’t commented on table 2 and you haven’t introduced table 3 yet. The first aspect of your analysis lacks cohesion. Tables are presented without introduction and many of your findings are discussed briefly or not at all.

Questions: Where do these quotes end? Where did you get this result? Where is (A) and (B)? Why haven’t you commented on . . ..?   
Queries: Perhaps another section here? Examples?

2.3.3. Strategy C: giving explicit detailed suggestions or advice on strategies The giving of advice on the writing process, and how to meet the conventions required was particularly notable in the spoken data. Students very much appreciated these tricks of the trade, as they saw them, in that not only were they practical suggestions, but they also gave the students insights into how the tutors themselves view the writing process. (An example on referencing Table 3, point 9.)

and I think here in order to demonstrate that you understand what is meant by this you need to give some examples it’s always a good idea to try and get a balance between explanation which you’ve tried to work on hard here and examples which will illustrate your explanation (TO-C-J-37-8).

em I think that more than a one sentence conclusion would have been possible— you might for example have related these ideas to your own teaching situation and said a little more about how you think methodology and materials might develop there—that would have been a good personal way to end drawing on your own experience—but do think more about how to conclude an essay (TO-A-J-48-52).

# 2.3.4. Strategy $D$ : indicating reader’s reaction

This includes both comment on how the tutor ‘read’ the paper, and on how she tried to figure out what the writer intended:

as I read through I checked each reference with the bibliography and you’ve got rather a strange bibliography because some of the people you quote like Claudia Kay and Ilona Leki are not actually in your bibliography (TO-C-J-74). em presumably this means that you have read these sources but you haven’t actually quoted them in the text? (TO-C-J-85).

em do you mean that you’re going to discuss these issues later on? (TO-C-K-42).

and the first thing that I’d like to say is that I think this is a very clear overall explanation of the writing process eh I had no difficulty at all following it as a reader (TO-C-J-68-9).

2.3.5. Strategy E: indicating the significance These comments put the feedback in a wider context.

so all of this about referencing is very important (TO-C-J-89).

or alternatively

it’s a very technical comment but just have it in mind next time (TO-A-K-15).

where the tutor’s intonation emphasises the relative unimportance of the comment on referencing that follows.

2.3.6. Strategy $F$ : expressing expectations of improvement Many of the above strategies focus on feedback that points the way forward in terms of what to do; strategy F in contrast sets expectations as future targets.

this is a piece of work from the first term but by the second term and certainly by the time you get to your dissertation these shouldn’t any longer be problems (TO-C-J-90).

2.3.7. Strategy G: unqualified praise Examples of unqualified praise on A papers are:

em I’ve just turned to your bibliography now em it seems to be very well written em you have included all the references and it’s very consistent and well set out. It also shows your wide reading of the topic (TO-A-K-104-5).

I’ve just started reading your essay em I’ve put a one in the margin because I very much appreciate the way you’ve gone straight into the schema theory model $I$ think you’re quite right that it was in the light of this theory that we have the concepts of top down and bottom up processing because prior to that there had been very much a focus on bottom up processing em especially in reading in a second and foreign language where reading was very much seen as a language problem so I think that you’ve absolutely gone right to the core of the essay in starting this way (TO-A-J-1-4).

Such strings of praise were not uncommon in the A papers, and occurred only once in the C papers. More common in the C papers was praise that functioned as a sweetener or good news in anticipation of critique or bad news (this is good, but . . .).

# 2.3.8. Strategy $H$ : praise as sweetener

A common strategy in both the oral and the written feedback was to use praise as a sweetener in a Praise–Critique–Suggestion/Advice sequence, as in this written feedback by tutor J:

Praise: Your introduction is useful in that you address the issues in the title immediately and that you signal the structure of your argument clearly to your reader.

Critique: I’m not sure why you start with purposes for reading as this is not taken up later in the essay   
Suggestion: (though you could have related purpose to the precise nature of interactive reading and whether this varies across texts).

As Hyland’s discussion of opening praise moves in book reviews suggests, this strategy is similar to those described across a range of genres from phatic conversation to written peer feedback and interpersonally ‘may operate to establish rapport with the audience and mitigate the criticism to follow’ (Hyland, 2000: 53). Viewed as a situation-problem-solution type text, ‘the function of the ’good’ evaluation element within the Situation is to put the Problem . . . into the larger context of ‘good’ aspects’ (Hoey, 1992: 37) In this vein, Hill’s (2001) analysis of what she calls the feedback sandwich in written feedback suggests it has the structure: Good news–Bad news and how to overcome it–Note of encouragement. In their comparison of sequences, Hyland and Hyland (2001: 194–196) find $20 \%$ of Criticism in Praise– Criticism pairs, $1 5 \%$ in Criticism–Suggestion pairs and $9 \%$ in Praise–Criticism– Suggestion triads.

In my analysis I suggest that the praise as sweetener extends over the whole feedback unit (which generally corresponds to chunks between pauses in the taping, but is identified by intonation as well as move patterns). In other words, the tutor would read a section of the paper, point the student to the section she had read (an Orienting move), Praise certain feature(s), then begin a series of three move sequences, each of which has a lower pitch onset, and which might be Orient^Critique^Suggest or Orient^Critique^Summary. In other words, the one Praise could sweeten several critiques in one unit. Table 6 shows an example of this.

As suggested by Table 6, there were more Critique than Praise moves overall (Table 8 shows $67 \%$ more) and most of that praise functioned as sweetener. This analysis cannot readily be compared with Hyland and Hyland (2001) which found praise to be more frequent than criticism or suggestion, as the latter analysed feedback points (not moves) on written (not spoken) end of text (not all) comments in an ESL (not content) class on drafts and final versions of papers.

Praise used as sweetener was not usually High Praise (excellent, very clear). It tended to be Mid Praise (good, clear, well), and occasionally was Low Praise (fine, okay, not bad). Mid praise includes instances where high praise terms are mitigated (e.g. generally very good). Where critique did follow high praise, it was generally in a High Praise–Mid Praise–Critique sequence, or on one occasion it was Mid Praise–High Praise–Critique. This suggests that it is not simply the use of praise that might alert the students that critique may follow, but specifically the use of Mid Praise.

# 2.3.9. The distribution of strategy types

Of the eight strategies identified (Sections 2.3.1 – 2.3.7), some are typical of taped oral rather than written feedback. Table 7 shows a comparison of strategies used by two tutors to give feedback on two topics (organisation and referencing), in equivalent modules (on methodology), in the two modes, and across different grades. Where possible A and C papers were chosen, and where there were several C, or B, papers, the one with most comment on the relevant topic was chosen.

Although this analysis is small scale and exploratory in nature and is limited to the comments on two topics of two tutors on seven papers, it suggests that the range of strategies used in taped-oral feedback is greater in comparison to written feedback. Moreover, it suggests that written feedback is qualitatively different in that it focuses more on the textual product (B) as opposed to strategic advice (C), reader’s reaction (D), an explication of the significance of errors (E) and expectations for future improvement (F).

# 2.4. Opening and closing

The taped-oral feedback is clearly a product of its communicative context and purpose in that typically the speaker’s opening moves include an orientation to the absent addressee; followed by comment (praise and critique) on the text as the purpose is evaluation, recommendations (suggestions or advice) as this is a formative context; and a closing move (typically a summary) which indicates the feedback on that section or aspect of the text has finished. The overall proportions of these moves in the taped data is given in Table 8, which also includes characteristic linguistic realisations.

The nature of the opening moves (Attend, Orient, Preface) means that in comparison with written feedback, the taped-oral feedback contains more vocatives, and the tutors regularly tell students explicitly what they have read. These both contribute to the more involved interpersonal tone of the spoken discourse.

In contrast, the frequent summary moves, which are also, I argue, a product of the mode change, function to increase the explicitness of taped-oral over written feedback. They force tutors to regularly repeat or rephrase the comment and highlight important features throughout the feedback, not simply at the end as is common in the written feedback. Indeed, Young and Nguyen (2002) argue that teacher summaries contribute significantly to the greater accessibility of the spoken discourse over the written textbooks.

# 3. Conclusions and implications for practice

It has been suggested that in comparison with written feedback by the same tutors, taped-oral feedback is longer, more intricate, and less lexically dense allowing for more unpacking of technical terms; it uses more vocatives, a wider range of obligation, more second person pronouns as Subjects, and more hedging; there is more, and more judgmental appraisal; it includes more attending, orienting and summarising moves; and it employs a wider range of feedback strategies. The comparisons described in the paper provide further examples of the differences between spoken and written discourse; of different ways of construing audience; and of how very different the feedback tends to be in different modes.

It has also been argued that the mode change has a knock on effect on the linguistic features and on the shift in audience away from external markers; these in turn have a knock on effect on the feedback strategies; all of which results in engaging the students more personally and producing feedback that is more formative for the students. These trends are reinforced by the implications of the communicative context on the generic structure where we see opening moves which increase audience engagement and summary moves which increase explicitness of feedback. Ivanic et al. (1994: 16) state that the ‘subject tutors must, in the last resort, use their comments to justify their grades, whereas the EAP tutor has the more developmental aim of helping the student . . .’ write. What this study suggests is that with a simple mode change, subject and EAP tutors would naturally move towards greater involvement with the student and more explicit and varied feedback that addresses not only the justification of a grade, but also the developing writer.

This study contributes to the literature on the changing nature of discourse in higher education. Where reductions in individual tutorial time with students together with the push for standardisation and accountability may result in more concise, text-focused feedback, one way to counter this in EAP and mainstream courses is through the use of taped-oral feedback.

The study was part of a larger project to pilot the use of taped-oral feedback on an MA programme. Other project findings include little difference in the time taken to produce taped-oral vs written feedback (as confirmed by other studies such as Boswood & Dwyer, 1995: 23; Kirschner, 1991: 191), and the main concerns expressed by the second and external examiners who could not easily ‘skim’ the tapes. A short written summary of the comments was provided in addition to the tapes for such monitoring purposes—a useful practice for all tutors and students, irrespective of the role of further markers (e.g., Hyland, 1990). The students came from a wide range of different countries and cultures, and while there were a few comments from some that the taped feedback was ‘not necessary’, most found the additional dimensions brought by the taped-oral feedback beneficial in affective terms (they felt as if someone had really read what they had written and thought about it) and in practical terms (they found the advice accessible). Such student comments strengthen the arguments based on textual analyses in this paper.

One final implication for practice relates to the usefulness of talking about feedback with or among tutors to explore understandings (Gardner, 1999b). For instance, in our own centre the marking criteria for written work include a consideration of whether assignments have ‘demonstrated understanding’. In spoken feedback tutors were found to make more specific suggestions about ways in which students could meet this criterion (e.g. ‘give an example here to show you understand’). One of the most difficult tasks facing EAP tutors must be the unpacking of assessment criteria from target departments. Perhaps the use of taped-oral feedback might constitute a means to achieve this objective and provide assessment with a more formative focus, without placing any greater demands on busy course tutors.
