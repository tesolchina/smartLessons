Recent years has witnessed the increasing complexit of aademic writing and writers and their movement acros borders of nation, discipline, and language. Meanwhil the language ideology of monolingualism has ben challenged extensively (Xiao & Zhao, 2022). Previous models of identity development and assimilation have also been contested. For instance, the post-structuralism theory was proposed to problematize the acculturation theory (Norton, 2010). Furthermore, the intricacy and variet of English academic writing in many cross national, cultural, anddisciplinary contexts all for more studies (Golden et al., 2021). o describe the acual multiplicity of academic writing and writers in various contexts, terms like translingualit, transnationality, and transdisciplinarity have evolved. Yet further research is in demand to unpack the complexity of the problems encountered by crossborder students and teachers of academic writing and suggest possible solutions.

Addressing the above gaps in the field of academic writig, Jonathan Hall and Bruce Horner co-edited avolume entitled Toward a Transnational University: WAc/wID across Borders of Language, Nation, and Discipline'. This timely collction written by a team of established scholars examines the oportunities and problems that come with teaching academic writing in light of teachers, students, scholars, and institutional programs moving across linguistic national, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries. The book explores various aspects of cros-border academic writing, including its history, evolution, challenges, opportunities, and prospects. The practice of learning and teaching academic writing conflicts with not only the perceptions of teachers and students but also the institutional policies. The chapters in this book delineate those conflicts, identify the problems and propose solutions.

The volume comprises Introduction, part I, part I and part II, plus fterword, with14 chapters in total. In the ntroduction, Bruce Horner provides an overview of the whole book, and outlines it objectives, the driving forces behind the new trend of cross-border tertiary English academic writing, and the tensions between the actual practice of academic writing and the ideology behind insti. tutional policies. In addition, he offers a snapshot of each chapter to capture the authors' main argument, the primary findings and pedagogical suggestions.

The three chapters in Part I entitled "Rewriting Writing Disciplines: Trans- Perspectives" underscores the theoretical perspectives underpinning cross-border tertiary English academic writing. In Chapter 2, Jonathan Hll draws upon interdisciplinary scholarshp with a \*trans" perspective to reconsider the role of Writing across the Currculum/Writing in the Disciplines (WAc/wID). He argues that WAc/wID engages in\*boundary work' as it confronts and responds to longstanding national, linguistic, and disciplinary borders. These borders are inherently limited in their ability to address the challenges faced by WAc/WID. This argument of Hall can help us describe the ways that writers cross national, language, and disciplinary boundaries and continuously improve our understanding of those ways.

In Chapter 3, Donahue explores the historical divisions between writing and language studies in the United States and examines how transnationalism ofers new possibilities for understanding the relationship between these two field. The chapter underscores a transnational approach to composition studies that advocates working across various disciplines and languages instead of dividing them.

Gentil's Chapter 4 presents a case study of a graduate student conducting cross-lingual and cross-national research and writing in French and English. The study reveals the tensions that arise when attempting to utilize diverse linguistic and disciplinary resource within settings that strongly adhere to rigid boundaries between them. The chapter unravels that adopting a "transnational trans lingual' approach to teaching academic writing can help students overcome monolingualism and leverage their own linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

The second part, entitled \*Professional Development: Trans-Perspectives," consists of four chapters that document specific chal. lenges faced by institutions and their strategies for professional development. For example, Chapter 5 discusses collaborative efforts among faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students from various disciplines at a Hispanic-Serving institution. They view students' and faculty's heritage languages, as well a transnational and transborder experiences, as valuable resources rather than barrers for learning and scholarly pursuits. Similarly, Gail Shuck describes how her universty established a "global business communication' partnership due to a sharp increase in international students from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and how faculty developed policies and pedagogies driven by the needs of addressing the linguistic and cultural diversity of these students.

Chapter 7, authored by Joyce Meier and colleagues, showcases a study involving faculty from different disciplines. The findings highlights the importance of involving faculty from non-language-focused fields, including writing studies, in efrt to recalibrate teaching practices to incorporate cultural knowledge and leverage the languages students bring to their academic work. Sharma and Hammond, in Chapter 8, delineate a series of transnational WAC collborations between Nepalese and U.S.-based faculty and administrators, which have provided them with both exciting prospects and humbling challenges for crosscultural exchange and cooperation in the field of wAC.

Part I, ntitled Transin Instittional Structures, fatures five chapters that explore the challenges and strategies asociated with transnational and transdisciplinary work within specific institutional contexts. For instance, in Chapter 9, Amy Hodges analyzes how the export f earning outcomes for WAC/WID programs at Texas A&M University Qatar is influenced by the needs and backgrounds of local students from diverse nationalities and language backgrounds.

Chapter 10 examines the conflicting goals faced by engineering faculty at a Japanese university that strives to attract more in. ternational students while also aiming to teach disciplinary knowledge in Japanese. It was argued that this conflict arises due to the Japanese government's promotion of English Medium Instruction (EMI) and contradicts the principles of the WAC/WID movement that emphasize the close relationship between writing and knowledge development.

In Chapter 11, Yongyan Li investigates Chinese undergraduate disciplinary writing pedagogy through a corpus of published scholarship. Li identifies three strands within this scholarship, unknown to scholars outside the Chinese context, and highlights the potential of English for Academic Purposes to encourage more emphasis on "writing to learn' and cross-cultural discussions.

Chapter 12 by Mohammad Shamsuzzaman presents a comparison of writing produced by undergraduate students from the United States and Bangladesh, as well as their comments on each other's txts. The findings indicate differences in familiarity with English. medium academic writing conventions encouraged in the US, as well as conflicting beliefs about writing development.

Finall, Chapter 13 by Jonathan Halland Nela Navarro focuses on graduate students designated as \*international and argues that they should be understood as "transnational emerging scholars" with complex identties tied to various languages, disciplines, and socio-cultural afiliations. The Afteword y Federico Navarr, reflects on the chapters in the ollection. It cautions against simplistic approaches that overlook local constraints while emphasizing the importance of considering specific pressures and conditions within historical, temporal, and spatial contexts.

The volume has a few noteworthy strengths. Firstly, the book is anchored in an insightul understanding of language, nation, and disciplinary boundaries. It interrogate the monolingual ideology and critiques traditional modelsof aculturation and assimilation in a world where academic writing, students and instructors traverse borders seamlessly. In adition, the chapters provide valuable insights into the conflicts that not only involve the perceptions of teachers and students but also clash with institutional policies. By carefull delineating these tensions, the authors shed light on the problems faced by both instructors and learners in navigating the complex terrain of writing across borders. Furthermore, the book brings together scholars across the globe from various dsciplinary and cultural backgrounds to ofer a rich account of the complexity and diversty of academic writing in a globalized world. Lastly, the book is not limited to theoretical explorations. It delves into the ractical challenges and opportunities that arise in the teaching and learning of academic witing across inguistc, national, disciplinary, and intutional boundaries. The chapters advance the state of the art by unveiling the complexity of these challenges, offring valuable insights and proposing solutions to inform teachers, researchers, and institutional programs.

Nevertheless the book has some palpable caveats. Firstly, to make a more robust claim to problematize the ideology of mono. lingualism, the authors could have drawn on some burgeoning theoretical frameworks of Global Englishes, for instance, poststructuralism (Norton, 2010) and intercultural citizenship (Baker & Fang, 2022). The integration of these theories to academic writing research might yield frutful findings. In addition, some chapters are opinion-based, while others are mostly qualitative case studies, except for Li's corpus sudy. More empirical studies could be included to demonstrate how to conduct research along this line of inquiry. Thirdy, more diverse data collction methods are needed. For instance, survey research could unearth the perceptions of students and teachers towards key factors and variable. Fourthly, a few chapters sm to focus on enginering students in Asia hence the diverst of tudent populations and contexts could be enhanced. Finally, the language of this book may not be acessible enough for graduate students. Notwithstanding these issues, the book is an essential read for students, instructors, administrators, and re searchers to understand the intricacy of English academic writing in today's globalized world.
