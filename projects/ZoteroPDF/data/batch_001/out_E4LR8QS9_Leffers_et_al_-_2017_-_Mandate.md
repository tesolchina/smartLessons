# Abstract

Purpose: The adverse health effects from climate change demand action from the nursing profession. This article examines the calls to action, the status of climate change in nursing education, and challenges and recommendations for nursing education related to climate change and human health.

Organizing Construct: Discussion paper.

Findings: The integration of climate change into nursing education is essential so that knowledge, skills, and insights critical for clinical practice in our climate-changing world are incorporated in curricula, practice, research, and policy. Our Ecological Planetary Health Model offers a framework for nursing to integrate relevant climate change education into nursing curricula and professional nursing education. Nursing education can offer a leadership role to address the mitigation, adaptation, and resilience strategies for climate change.

Conclusions: An ecological framework is valuable for nursing education regarding climate change through its consideration of political, cultural, economic, and environmental interrelationships on human health and the health of the planet. Knowledge of climate change is important for integration into basic and advanced nursing education, as well as professional education for nurses to address adverse health impacts, climate change responses policy, and advocacy roles.

Clinical Relevance: For current and future nurses to provide care within a climate-changing environment, nursing education has a mandate to integrate knowledge about climate change issues across all levels of nursing education. Competence in nursing practice follows from knowledge and skill acquisition gained from integration of climate change content into nursing education.

Calls to action for a response to the harmful health effects of global climate change drive the nursing profession to respond through nursing practice, research, advocacy, and education (Barna, Goodman, & Mortimer, 2012; Bell, 2011; Costello, Montgomery, & Watts, 2013; Kumaresan & Sathiakumar, 2010). Climate change education for nurses, both in practice and in academic educational programs, is critical to achieve this response. Climate change education expands the profession’s ability to influence policies at the individual, community, national, and global levels of practice. This article examines the calls to action and current status of climate change education in nursing to make recommendations for nursing education related to climate change and human health. Specifically, those recommendations include a proposed Ecological Planetary Health Model to serve as a framework for nursing education, as well as 10 broad recommendations to guide the development of curriculum design.

# Background

Since the harmful health effects of climate change are already being observed (U.S. Global Change Research Program [USGCRP], 2016) and are expected to increase over time (Costello et al., 2009; Neira, 2015), nurses and interprofessional colleagues are being called upon to act as experts on behalf of patients, communities, nursing organizations, and policymakers. Frequent reports of the harmful effects of climate change impacting health and the environment reach both health professionals and the general public through scientific and public media with direct requests for a response (Adlong & Dietsch, 2015; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017; International Council of Nurses [ICN], 2008; Sayre, Rahzi, Carpenter, & Hughes, 2010; White House, 2015a, 2015b; World Health Organization [WHO], 2016). Specifically, the 2008 ICN document, Nurses, Climate and Health, the American Nurses Association (ANA) 2008 House of Delegates resolution, Global Climate Change, and the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) initiatives on Climate Change and Health and The Role of Nurses in Addressing Climate Change (CNA, 2008, 2009) all urge nurses to address the greatest global health threat of our time (Costello et al., 2009). Their efforts are aimed at integrating mitigation, adaptation, and resilience strategies in nursing practice.

It is important to note that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change continue to rise globally (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2014) and, depending on the gas, remain in our atmosphere from 12 to thousands of years. The IPCC report Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability (IPCC, 2014) addresses global climate and its impacts upon food and water supplies; the frequency and severity of adverse weather events such as heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and wildfires; changes in vector populations; and the particular impacts upon vulnerable populations (IPCC, 2014). The Climate Change Impacts in the United States: The Third National Climate Assessment (Melillo, Richmond, & Yohe, 2014) reports similar results of increased temperature, changes in precipitation, acidification of oceans, and extreme weather patterns. The impact of these environmental changes results in threats to human health globally. The more recent report of the USGCRP, The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment (USGCRP, 2016), highlights the health impacts related to air, food, water, extreme weather, vectors, and temperature-related deaths. The report also focuses attention on the social determinants of health, with special attention to issues affecting vulnerable populations and the adverse effects on mental health and well-being.

Social determinants defined as “the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life” (WHO, 2017, para 1) can either improve or exacerbate vulnerability to poor health outcomes associated with climate change (USGCRP, 2016). For example, those who have access to adequate transportation in the event of evacuation, live in homes that are structurally sound, or live in communities with improved infrastructure with access to food and shelter are likely to fare better during weather-related disasters (USGCRP, 2016). The impacts of climate change can negatively affect existing health problems, but can also create new and unanticipated health problems.

# Populations Most Vulnerable to Impacts of Climate Change

Increased vulnerability to climate change results from a combination of health status and socioeconomic factors, and the interaction of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity at both individual and population levels. This is particularly critical in addressing the challenge of climate change and its associated negative health sequelae (USGCRP, 2016; WHO, 2016). Vulnerable groups include older adults, children and pregnant women, those with existing or chronic health problems or disabilities, immigrant groups, communities of color, and indigenous populations (Allen, 2015). Globally, indigenous populations already burdened by limited access to food and clean water are more likely to be subject to droughts, salt-water intrusion, and rising temperatures, resulting in shortages of food, water, and traditional herbal medicines. Pregnant women are at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes; children are at risk for heat-related diseases, diarrheal illness, and asthma; older adults at risk for extreme heat events as well as increased vulnerability to chronic illnesses. Social determinants of health such as lower income, immigrant status, poorer living conditions, increased burden of air pollution in neighborhoods, limited transportation, limited educational attainment, limited language proficiency, and limited access to health increase one’s risk (Sheffield & Landrigan, 2011).

# Status and Challenges for Integration of Climate Change in Nursing Education

Because the negative health effects of a changing climate are likely to increase over time, health professionals must become expert resources for patients, communities, and policymakers. Nurses are well positioned to respond to environmental-related health risks and outcomes (CNA, 2017). Although national nursing organizations have addressed the importance of education and advocacy, many nursing students are not adequately prepared regarding the health impacts of climate change and nursing profession response (Barna et al., 2012). Additionally, many practicing nurses are not formally educated in climate-related health and care delivery (Leffers, McDermott-Levy, Smith, & Sattler, 2014). Educating health professionals to address climate change– related health threats and outcomes is paramount to this goal (Bryce, Foley, & Reeves, 2016; Hanley, Bogart, Milburn, & Stafford, 2016; Johnsen, Torjesen, & Ennals, 2015).

Currently, no reported competencies are available to guide curriculum development for the integration of climate change into nursing education (Green et al., 2009; Maxwell & Blashki, 2016). However, many health professions’ organizations have disseminated statements about expected environmental health competencies (Bell, 2010, 2011; Butterfield et al., 2014; CDC, 2017; Desmond, 2016; Frenk et al., 2010; Green et al., 2009; Horton, 2010; Johnsen et al., 2015; Maxwell & Blashki, 2016). Despite the lack of climate change competencies for nursing education, earlier work in other disciplines advocate for climate change competencies (Bell, 2010; Maxwell & Blashki, 2016; Rabinowitz, Natterson-Horowitz, Kahn, Kock, & Pappionau, 2017).

Challenges to the development and implementation of climate change competencies and content into nursing education predominately relate to the lack of engagement around climate change in nursing practice. There is also limited knowledge among many faculty and nurse leaders regarding the relationship between nursing practice and climate events. There may also be resistance to inclusion of climate health issues in curricula that are already burdened to meet program standards. Furthermore, much of climate change education includes the science of climate change, GHG sources, and mitigation strategies, which have not been commonly addressed in nursing education (Barna et al., 2012). Currently, there is limited focus on nurses’ roles in adaptation and resilience strategies. It is essential that these challenges be addressed to facilitate effective climate change inclusion in nursing education and practice. In addition, competencies must be developed to facilitate the educational needs of nursing students and practicing nurses (Barna et al., 2012).

Nurse leaders currently engaged in climate and healthrelated issues urge nurses to address climate impacts in education and practice curricula (Anderko, Chalupka, & Afzal, 2012; Barna et al., 2012; Richardson, Grose, Doman, & Kelsey, 2014; Richardson, Grose, Jackson, et al.,

2014). Nursing education has a model for the develop ment of competencies and specific curriculum insertion points for integrating environmental health content into pre-professional and graduate education (Leffers et al., 2015) that could be applied to educational design for climate change curricula. Despite arguments that nursing curricula and professional development offerings are too content burdened, nursing educators should move forward to develop competencies and integrated curriculum recommendations. For example, information related to air pollution and climate change can be inserted into educational content about respiratory and cardiac pathology already included in nursing education. Risks and vulnerability specific to pregnant women, infants, and children can be inserted into family or parent–child nursing education. Each challenge to climate change education for nursing can and should be addressed to assure competency for practice in a climate-changing world (Barna et al., 2012).

# Recommendations for Nursing Education

In response to the calls to action and the important role of nurse educators to ensure educational preparation of the current and future generation of health professionals to address the health impacts of climate change, the following recommendations are offered.

First, a guiding framework offers wisdom for nursing and health professional education globally. This offers an important perspective that brings into nursing the global and ecological aspects of global climate change.

Second, a broad set of recommendations for nursing education address key perspectives, approaches, topic areas, and strategies to address the health impacts resulting from climate change. The recommendations will offer guidance to nursing educators as well as nursing organizations as they move forward to develop competencies for practice and goals and objectives for education. Subsequent to the foundational efforts to develop standards, competencies, and objectives, specific curriculum recommendations can be developed (Barna et al., 2012; Patrick, Capetola, Patrick, & Nuttman, 2012).

# Proposed Framework for Climate Change Nursing Education

Most nurses practice in settings that address the needs of the individual, family, or community. However, nurses must be aware of state, regional, or national policies that influence health beyond their sphere of practice as well as factors related to the social determinants of health, such as economic, political, cultural, and environmental influences (Patrick et al., 2012). Conversely, events and actions that occur at nurses’ practice settings could have impacts at the state, regional, national, or international levels, and nurses should understand that influence. Therefore, an ecological model (Sallis & Owen, 2016) provides a framework to address the complex issues related to climate change while including the settings where nurses most frequently practice and the influence of the settings beyond the nurse’s sphere of practice. Like areas of nursing practice, an ecological model is a systems model, as each level of the system is influenced by and influences the other. It is not prescriptive, in that specific features must be addressed; therefore, the nurse educator can include the variety of environmental, economic, political, cultural, and social factors that influence climate change specifically related to the location where the nurse practices. Consideration of the various factors that influence the environment as well as placing nursing’s practice setting within a larger framework in relation to care of the natural environment and earth speak to the call for planetary health. Planetary health is the global attainment of the highest standard of health, well-being, and equity through awareness and thoughtful stewardship of the political, economic, and social systems, as well as natural ecosystems, that influence the ability of humans to thrive (Whitmee et al., 2015). The planetary health perspective has been adopted by public health, medical, and nursing disciplines and has an ecological systems perspective (Johnston, Rogers, Cross, & Sochan, 2005; Whitmee et al., 2015).

This concept of caring for the earth is not new to nursing. Nurse scholars have called for the nursing profession to consider the influence of the natural environment on human health beyond community and public health nursing practice, and to consider how the natural environment influences all areas of nursing (Avery, 1995; Kleffel, 1991). Their recommendations endorse an ecocentric approach to care (Anderko, Chalupka, & Anderko, 2014; Kleffel, 1996; Wells, 2004). Much like planetary health, the ecocentric approach relies on the existing holistic nursing paradigm but expands nursing to address the interconnectivity to the earth and natural environment to support and sustain our well-being (Kleffel, 1996). Therefore, it is important for nurses to broaden their views and include an interrelated global ecosystem (Laustsen, 2006). These broader environmental perspectives highlight the importance of the health of the natural environment and planet as part of nursing’s role in meeting the health needs of the world’s people. Addressing political, cultural, social, economic, and environmental interrelationships on human health and the planet within an ecological framework is essential for the education of nurses regarding climate change.

To support nursing education related to the influence of climate change on health, we propose the Ecological Planetary Health Model (Figure 1). Within our proposed model, there are six spheres of practice: individual, family, community, region/nation, international, and planetary/earth. At the individual level is the person’s impact upon, as well as response to, a changing climate. At this level, individual behaviors such as using public transportation or walking to work can impact GHG emissions. Changing individual behavior is an area that nurses willingly include in their lifestyle (Barna et al., 2012). Climate changes, as noted previously, impact human health at the individual level in ways such as starvation from drought and the worsening of health problems such as asthma. The family level includes those who have a close personal interdependent relationship. Families can influence climate change by assuming individual behaviors and by sharing beliefs, knowledge, and action (Stevenson, Peterson, & Bondell, 2016). Further, their homes can be lost to adverse weather events. The community level comprises social organizations that influence the individual and family, such as schools, employers, faith-based organizations, and social and civic groups (Sallis & Owen, 2016). The regional/national and international levels are associated with geopolitical borders and include regional, national, and international organizations and regulations. The international level is the exchange between nations and includes international treaties and agreements as well as the impact of GHG effects across international borders. For community, region/national, and international levels, climate decision making is based on perceived population risk (Leiserowitz & Howe, 2015) and political, social, cultural, and economic factors within each level (Whitmee et al., 2015). The planetary/earth level is the level that includes the overall health and sustainability of the planet to support the global ecosystem and human thriving (Whitmee et al., 2015). At each of the levels are factors that can adversely affect the ecological level, and also impact organizations and interactions occurring at that level aimed at mitigation, adaptation, resilience, or exacerbation of our changing climate.

Political, social, cultural, economic, and environmental influences impact each of the ecological spheres of this model. These interrelated factors produce the determinants of health and affect the health impacts of climate change upon vulnerable populations. Political factors are related to local, state, national, and international polices that can support policies, tax, and provide subsidies for programs that support planetary health and human thriving (Whitmee et al., 2015). Social factors are the relations with groups of people, institutions, and organizations at community, state, and national levels. Cultural factors are the beliefs, values, morals, and practices that influence climate action (Frumkin, 2016). Economic influences constitute what is financially available at each of the ecological levels to influence planetary health. Environmental influences are the unique physical structures and trends that influence the health of a population, such as urbanization (Whitmee et al., 2015), or chemical, biological, and physical exposure risks, including geological landscapes such as mountains or plains (Frumkin, 2016). Collectively, these external factors shape risk, vulnerability, and resilience (Leffers et al., 2004).

Figure 1. The Ecological Planetary Health Model, illustrated by concentric circles, highlights the interrelationship and multiple levels of influence that nurses have on behaviors and actions to address the health of our planet. Each climate strategy is depicted as a colored cord on an integrated trajectory demonstrating that each climate strategy occurs in concert with the other, and the climate strategies influence the interventions between all levels of the model. The arrows outside the circles represent the political, social, cultural, economic, and environmental influences on human health and the health of the planet.

The climate action component of this model includes the three climate change responses (or strategies) of mitigation, adaptation, and resilience, which can take place at individual, family, community, region/nation, and international levels with benefits across the six levels of the model. These climate strategies are not always discrete, but, instead, are interrelated and interdependent. Since GHGs can take from 12 years to thousands of years to leave the atmosphere (EPA, n.d.a, n.d.b), it is important that nurses be prepared to address climate mitigation to reduce additional GHGs, as well as adaptation and resilience to withstand the impacts of climate change that will continue to occur. The model illustrates both the interrelationship of the three strategies and how each strategy can impact the six spheres of influence.

Climate mitigation efforts are methods to prevent or reduce strain on the planet related to GHG emissions (Bell, 2011; United Nations Environmental Programme, n.d.). Examples of climate mitigation for nurses could be reducing GHGs by transporting nursing staff to the hospital in energy-efficient public transportation. Climate adaptation is the nurse’s response in assessing the impact of, planning for, and managing the health-related burden (Bell, 2011; EPA, n.d.a, n.d.b). An example of nurse climate adaptation would be the management of the healthrelated effects of rising asthma rates resulting from the impacts of air quality, including ozone, pollen, and particulates, or in emergency responses to adverse weather events. The third strategy is climate resilience. This relates to the ability of nurses and other health professionals to create and reorganize communities and health systems that are able to withstand and thrive in the face of our changing climate by building infrastructure and creating processes to reorganize and endure extreme weather patterns, food and water insecurity, emerging diseases, and displaced people. To achieve climate resilience, economic, social, communications, and political systems must be responsive (Bajayo, 2012). The nurse’s role in climate resilience includes facilitating organization and group cohesion and engagement in policies that strengthen communities, regions, nations, and international relationships.

To understand how the Ecological Planetary Health Model would apply to nursing education for climate change, it is helpful to utilize an example. Imagine that a region of a high-income country is hit with an extreme storm system caused by excessive moisture in the air from heat trapping of GHGs that results in widespread flooding and disruption of civil services, including emergency management, healthcare systems, shelter, and food distribution. As an example of the utility of this model, consider this storm at the individual level. Mitigation of personal practices such as reducing the use of an automobile or lowering the thermostat on the heater at home helps prevent the rise in GHGs that led to the storm. To adapt an individual approach would require activation of an emergency plan, including emergency supplies and evacuation strategies for the extreme weather event. Resilience at the individual level would include maintaining close connections with others, self-care, health maintenance, and interfacing with community resources to withstand the extreme weather event.

The ability to respond to each strategy and the type of response would be influenced by the perception of the risk, economic, political, cultural, and social factors for the population targeted at each level. Therefore, consideration of climate vulnerability related to financial situation, power of the population, cultural view related to the environment, and social connections must be included. To assure environmental and climate justice, nurses need the education to strengthen these factors.

Using this model, educators can teach nursing students and practicing nurses about climate change and the impact they can make to achieve planetary health.

1. Employ an ecological perspective built from the Ecological Planetary Health Model for Nursing to ensure the interactive nature of human actions upon global impacts as well as global effects upon individual human impacts.   
2. Integrate climate change impacts and responses into pre-professional nursing education, graduate level nursing education, and professional development programs for nurses in practice.   
3. Include both lifespan and social determinants of health approaches to identify individuals and populations most vulnerable to climate impacts.   
4. Content for the care of children should be specific to the particular vulnerability of children to climate disasters, food and water insecurity, air pollution, vector-borne diseases, diarrheal diseases, and malnutrition.   
5. Include climate vulnerability related to the care of pregnant women and children. In particular, pregnant women are more vulnerable to excess heat events and inhalation of particulate matter that can result in adverse birth outcomes.   
6. Integrate into the care of adults content that addresses the increased vulnerability of various occupational groups and people living with disabilities. Additionally, the impacts of climate change upon those with pre-existing chronic conditions must be considered.   
7. Include increased vulnerability to extreme heat events, climate disasters, poor air quality, and waterborne and vector-borne diseases into the care of older adults.   
8. Consider the social factors that contribute to vulnerability for adverse health outcomes from the impact of climate change. Social determinants such as income, education, transportation, neighborhood, housing, language proficiency, social isolation, marginalization, and other social stressors impact health outcomes must be considered.   
9. Include content regarding the policy and advocacy role of nurses to address health hazards in the environment and to develop policy to reduce climate change health risks through mitigation, adaptation, and resilience.   
10. Integrate the climate change strategies of mitigation, adaptation, and resilience into all content areas for education and practice. This includes efforts to take personal and professional action for mitigation, to prepare for disaster and emergency response, and to work for climate justice to build resilience globally.

# Recommendations for Nursing Education Design

Without making specific recommendations for each type of educational curriculum (pre-professional, graduate, or professional development education), there are broad areas that must be considered. It is essential that educational designs begin with clear learning objectives tailored to the specific audience of learners (Maxwell & Blashki, 2016). From those goals and objectives, essential climate issues should be addressed. Our recommendations are detailed in Table 1 and are broadly stated to ensure that nurses, globally and across all educational settings, will engage in and develop regional, culturally appropriate, and professionally relevant competencies, curricula, and educational strategies to advance nursing education in addressing climate change and health. The recommendations include the adoption of the Ecological Planetary Health Model to guide curriculum development, the inclusion of climate change health effects and responses into nursing education, specific lifespan and social determinants of health approaches, age-specific health concerns, focus upon risks and vulnerabilities, and the adoption of an advocacy role for nurses.

# Conclusion

The scientific evidence compels the nursing profession to educate nurses across all levels of academic and professional education to ensure competency in addressing mitigation, adaptation, and resilience strategies for nursing practice. Despite challenges in developing and implementing climate change content in nursing education, related to the lack of engagement with climate issues in nursing practice, limited knowledge about climate change among nursing faculty, and resistance to inclusion of climate health knowledge in the curricula of content-heavy programs, opportunities exist to move forward in response to mandates from the scientific community, governments, and nursing organizations. The recommendations addressed in this article offer guidance for national nursing organizations, educational programs, and practice settings across the globe to integrate climate change content into nursing education. Nurses must be competent practitioners, advocates, and change agents to ensure the public’s health in the face of climate threats. It is critical to address political, social, cultural, economic, and environmental interrelationships on human health and the health of the planet, and the Ecological Planetary Health Model offers a valuable approach for education of nurses regarding climate change.
