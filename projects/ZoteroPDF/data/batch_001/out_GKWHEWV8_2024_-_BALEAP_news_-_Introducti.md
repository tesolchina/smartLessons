# BALEAP news - Introduction to SIGs: Meet the in-sessional special interest group

# 1. Background

In-sessional EAP delivery is a rapidly developing field within the wider discipline and may be characterised not only by the wide variety of forms which it can assume (and indeed names it can take), but also by the particular dynamics that can arise in its delivery. These may include: grappling with unfamiliar content and ways of communicating that content; working with novel cohorts or types of students including students from a diverse range of linguistic backgrounds; and ways of working with and alongside other academics that may be new to many practitioners. The BALEAP In-sessional SIG seeks to create a dynamic space for colleagues involved in both the delivery and management of In-sessional EAP to share best practice and build their knowledge of and facility in In-sessional EAP delivery.

The SIG was established on $2 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ March 2023 following a successful proposal to create an In-sessional EAP special interest group within BALEAP.

The BALEAP In-sessional Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to provide a forum for:

• Evaluating practices, pooling concerns and questions from In-sessional practitioners.   
• Developing scholarship and research around In-sessional-specific pedagogies, working practices, practitioner identity, training and development.   
• Supporting collaboration between In-sessional practitioners across institutions.   
• Supportive discussions around in-sessional practices.

# 2. Events and activities

The SIG has held several well-attended and impactful events. It was decided that the first event would be an introduction to the SIG and the Committee. Two of the Committee Members, Jess Sequera and Jenna Bodin-Galvez presented on how In-sessional EAP manifests itself in their respective contexts, after which attendees discussed some prompts in breakout rooms. This was attended by 74 individuals.

The second event was a book launch of Chapman and Tibbets (2023) A Guide to In-sessional English for Academic Purposes. After a presentation by the co-authors, a large number of questions were asked by those present. This memorable event was attended by 72 individuals.

Our third event was a talk by Alison Leslie of the University of Leeds, entitled ‘Stepping Up, Standing Out: Supporting international postgraduate students to make the most of their year in a UK university’. After Alison's presentation, participants discussed the insessional situation at their institutions in breakout rooms. This interesting and popular event had 100 participants, and there was discussion of Alison returning to run an event for the SIG in the future, once the project is complete.

We have developed our website, https://in-sessional.baleap.org. This hosts the recordings of all our events and will continue to do so. We have also set up our YouTube channel for content including our events, research, and information on our activities: ISSIG on YouTube and our X for communicating on all things In-sessional https://x.com/InsessionalSig.

# 3. Impact

Event feedback has been incredibly positive, with event satisfaction ranging from $8 8 \%$ to $1 0 0 \%$ . Reported positive impacts include:

• A chance to network and share experiences, especially in smaller groups.   
• An opportunity to focus solely on In-sessional provision. • Useful topics and discussions.   
• Well-organised events.   
• A place to present research on In-sessional provision.

Members are also given the opportunity to feedback on what they would like from the SIG, which feeds into the annual planning meeting, and to submit proposals for future events.

# 4. Future plans

• Several events are already being planned for the 2024-25 academic year, on areas such as in-sessional in an EMI context, finding the balance between EGAP and ESAP, and evaluating the impact of in-sessional provision.   
• Offering events our members want, reading circles, joint events with other SIGs, presenting at conferences, sharing resources and more. Suggestions are invited via our event feedback form and proposal form.   
• Continuing to support our membership.
