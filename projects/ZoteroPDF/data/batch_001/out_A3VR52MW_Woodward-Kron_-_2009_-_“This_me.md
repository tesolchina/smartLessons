# Abstract

One broad goal for English for Academic Purposes students is to learn to write effectively so they can succeed in their chosen academic studies. The teaching of academic writing sensitive to context and texts has benefited from disciplinary based writing studies, allowing EAP teachers and their students to become better informed about the valued writing practices of various disciplines. A further development in this area can be gained by investigating from a linguistic perspective the role of writing for learning in those disciplines.

This paper reports on a longitudinal study which mapped from a lexicogrammatical perspective how $\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ education students’ writing developed as their disciplinary knowledge increased. Systemic functional linguistics provided the theoretical framework for the study and the analytical tools. Reasoning and explaining, reporting and engaging with knowledge claims, and engaging with the discipline as a future practitioner were intrinsic to the learner discourse of education in this study. The contextualised descriptions of the lexicogrammatical choices the students made in their writing provide authentic disciplinary examples for EAP writing teachers. These resources will allow EAP teachers and their students to examine writing not only from the perspective of learning to write, but from the perspective of writing to learn in the discipline.

# 1. Learning to write and writing to learn

‘‘How do I know what I think until I see what I say’’ E.M. Forster Howard’s End

One goal of EAP teaching is to assist students to learn to write in ways that are valued in academia and in students’ chosen disciplines of study. A body of research is available to EAP teachers on aspects of academic writing, including disciplinary genre variation (Paltridge, 2004; Samraj, 2002) and the social and rhetorical dimensions of writing in the academy (e.g. Bazerman, 1992; Hyland, 1994, 1999, 2000; Johns, 1997; Myers, 1996; Odell, 1992). The pedagogic implications of this research for EAP are that learning to write at university involves engaging with these aspects of writing.

This paper will argue that there are potential benefits to be gained for EAP writing teachers and their students by viewing the role of student writing from a disciplinary perspective, that is, through the eyes of their course content (i.e. faculty) lecturers. Faculty use student writing frequently as a vehicle to assess and scrutinize their students’ understanding of, and engagement with the course content. The EAP emphasis for teaching writing, in contrast, has necessarily more to do with learning how to write successfully in the disciplines. For students, the process of writing term papers and assignments can be a catalyst for learning, clarifying and developing their understandings of subject matter. ‘Learning to write’ and ‘writing to learn perspectives’ are related, yet in EAP there has been little attention over the past decade paid to the learning through writing perspective, despite the growing interest in disciplinary discourses and their discursive practices.

Earlier research which did focus on the role of writing for learning tended to ignore context and concentrate on the cognitive processes that occur when students write (e.g. Flower & Hayes, 1981). Bizzell (1982) has referred to this research and its associated pedagogies as ‘‘inner directed’’. A focus on cognition is evident in the work of the genre theorists, Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995), who argue for both the social and cognitive dimensions of writing and who claim that knowledge about genre is a form of situated cognition embedded in disciplinary activities. What is absent in the work of Berkenkotter and Huckin is any linguistic or textual insights into how situated cognition may be instantiated in student writing. For EAP practitioners who wish to go beyond discourse organization and engage students with a range of clause level language choices to reason, define, evaluate and so on, published teaching materials tend to be limited to decontextualised, generic examples.

# 1.1. A linguistic perspective of learning through language

To understand the divergent disciplinary directions and perspectives of research into language, writing and learning, Hewings (1999) suggests that it is best to take into account disciplinary differences: cognitive psychologists are concerned to investigate the cognitive dimensions of language and learning, while applied linguists prefer the more tangible evidence of text and context. Yet for understandings of the role of language in learning, valuable insights have been gained from crossing disciplinary boundaries. Vygotsky’s (1962) pioneering work on the relation between language, social context and thinking processes has resonated with educational linguists working within a systemic functional framework, in particular with researchers who have investigated children’s language development (Derewianka, 1995; Halliday, 1975; Painter, 1984, 1996). In Halliday’s and Painter’s work, the emphasis is on how ‘‘children were learning through their language’’ (Halliday, 1999: 70, original emphasis). Halliday refers to the process of learning through language as construing experience, to describe the way language is used by individuals as an organising principle to categorise experience. Drawing on his own 1975 case study data, Painter’s data (1984, 1996) and Derewianka’s study (1995), Halliday (1999) maps the development of young children’s language and emphasises the role of language as a resource for thinking and learning. Grammatical resources such as reporting processes (the book says), sensing processes (I think, do you know?), identifying clauses to define, and internal causal conjunctions to reason are viewed as particularly important for educational learning. These accounts of the role of language in thinking and learning provided the theoretical and analytical starting point for considering how education students were learning specialist knowledge through their developing use of language.

This paper examines the lexicogrammatical resources students undertaking an undergraduate teaching degree drew on in their assessment writing tasks to engage with and learn disciplinary knowledge. The longitudinal framework and discipline specific focus of the study allow the findings to be discussed in terms of the students’ writing development as well as in terms of what is valued as good writing in the discipline.

# 2. The disciplinary context of the study

This study into the lexicogrammatical resources education students drew on to learn and engage with disciplinary knowledge is part of a larger study into students’ learning through writing in an education faculty at a regional Australian university. The data for the larger study were sixteen $\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ students’ written assignments collected over a three year period in a core subject, student and tutor interviews, and other contextual information such as course outlines, tutors’ marginal comments on students’ writing, and assessment criteria. These data informed a ‘thick’ description of writing practices in the disciplinary context and contributed towards a provisional identification of valued learner discursive practices (Woodward-Kron, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008). Of importance for this study is the finding that critical analysis was highly valued by the faculty. Critical analysis in writing in the education faculty involved making connections between theory and practice, evaluating theories and research, particularly in terms of their implication for the classroom, as well as arguing and reasoning (Woodward-Kron, 2002). The valued assignment genres were Expositions in which students foregrounded their informed arguments (Woodward-Kron, 2005) and Evaluative Accounts in which students evaluated the literature and made connections with their future role as classroom teachers (Woodward-Kron, 2003). While these studies provided a discourse analytical account of writing to learn in the discipline, the current study’s focus is the students’ lexicogrammatical choices for the learning processes mediated through writing. For the purposes of this paper, the phrase ‘learning processes mediated through writing’ refers to processes that are significant for the students’ own learning that are realised through language.

The selection of learning processes for analysis in this study was informed by the academic discourse literature, by the contextual data from the larger study, and by a preliminary analysis of the student texts. A number of linguistic studies have focussed on aspects of engaging with disciplinary knowledge including citation practices (Hyland, 1999) and evaluation (Hewings, 1999; Hunston, 1994; Hood, 2004; Silver, 2003; Ventola, 1997). Other studies have investigated language choices to do with constructing disciplinary knowledge through processes such as naming, defining and classifying (Wignell, 1998; Wignell et al., 1993), causality (Mohan & Slater, 2004) and reasoning (Martin, 1985). These studies formed the starting point for the analysis. The processes which were subsequently analysed in depth were: naming, defining and classifying; reasoning and explaining; and reporting knowledge claims and engaging with disciplinary knowledge. A further category of ‘becoming a practitioner/teacher’ was added after preliminary analysis of the student texts. These categories are elaborated below as well as the linguistic framework of analysis. The findings for naming, defining and classifying are not included in this paper but have been reported in Woodward-Kron (2008). As the student data are used in the elaboration of the analytical framework, data collection and selection is described first.

# 3. The analytical framework and methods

# 3.1. Data selection

The written assignments of six undergraduate pre-service Education students were selected from their first and third year of study (twelve assignments in total). High scoring texts as well as lower scoring texts were selected to allow for a comparison of the students’ lexicogrammatical choices. The texts were also compared longitudinally. In the presentation of the results and discussion, the term ‘high scoring texts’ refers to texts in the Distinction to High Distinction grade range, while ‘low scoring texts’ refers to Pass and Credit graded texts. High Distinction (HD) grades are in the range of $8 5 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ , Distinction (D) $7 5 \% - 8 4 \%$ , Credit (C) $6 5 \% - 7 4 \%$ , Pass (P) $50 \% - 6 4 \%$ . The texts selected were the students’ first assignment written in their studies and their final assignment. The first year texts were written in response to an essay assignment asking students to consider the nature-nurture debate on the course of child development (1000e1500 words). The third year assignment required students to decide which theories of children’s thinking and learning were most defensible for the students’ future role as primary teachers (2000 words). For the analysis, the texts were divided into clauses and the clauses were numbered. Quotations shorter than three lines were included in the clause analysis while longer quotations were omitted. A summary of the textual data is given in Table 1. In accordance with the Human Research Ethics Committee approval for this project, the participating students are referred to by pseudonyms.

# 3.2. Theoretical framework

The linguistic analysis was informed by Halliday’s systemic functional grammar (Halliday, 1985/1994). In systemic linguistic theory language is seen to be organised to achieve three types of meanings (Halliday, 1979). These are:

meanings representing events or what is happening and the logical meanings between them (ideational meanings), interaction between speakers/readers (interpersonal meanings), and the organization of experiential and interpersonal meanings into a coherent whole (textual meanings). The present study focuses on students’ language choices to name, define, reason, report knowledge, and envisage themselves as teachers. Therefore, the language function examined here is the way in which happenings or experience is represented and connected through language (ideational meanings). The unit of analysis is the clause, the components of which from a functional perspective are Participant, Process, and Circumstance1 . The clause below elaborates these components.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Teachers</td><td>develop</td><td>their resources</td><td> gradually</td><td>over time.</td></tr><tr><td>PARTICIPANT</td><td>PROCESS</td><td>PARTICIPANT</td><td>CIRCUMSTANCE</td><td>CIRCUMSTANCE</td></tr><tr><td>Nominal gr.</td><td>Verbal gr.</td><td>Nominal group</td><td>Adverbial group</td><td>Prepositional phrase</td></tr></table></body></html>

Here, Participants are realised grammatically by nominal groups, Processes by verbal groups, and Circumstances by adverbial groups and prepositional phrases. As one of the categories of analysis is reasoning and explaining, the analysis also takes into account conjunctive elements i) between clauses in a clause complex; ii) and between clause complexes. That is:

i) The approach is promising because it challenges students.   
ii) Teachers need to develop students’ skills. Therefore, opportunities for skill practice are required.

To track any developments in students’ writing from a writing to learn perspective, the notion of congruent and less congruent realisations in language choices has been adopted in this study. From a systemic functional perspective, congruent refers to correspondence between the semantics (meanings) and the lexicogrammar. In the example teachers develop their resources gradually over time, the Participant is a nominal group and the Process a verbal group. In this example, the realisation of the wordings into meanings is considered to be a congruent or natural one. In academic discourse, however, less congruent realisations are common. Processes tend to be repackaged as things or events through nominalisation, for example, e.g. Piaget argued to Piaget’s argument and related to other things or events in the clause (Woodward-Kron, 2008). Nominalisation allows more information to be condensed into the nominal group and linked to other participants in the clause. In the examples below, the nominalised Participant Piaget’s argument . is linked to other Participants in the clause through verbal processes. In systemic functional terms, this is referred to as expanding meaning potential as it allows different participant roles in the clause to be connected through relational clause grammar. (nominalisations as Participants highlighted).

# [to contrast]

Piaget’s argument that learning comes about through the child’s individual attempts to assimilate or accommodate information contrasts with Vygotsky’s view that social interactions are crucial for development.

# [to explain/to show causation]

Piaget’s argument that learning comes about through the child’s individual attempts to assimilate or accommodate information has resulted in the development of teaching strategies to promote autonomous thinking.

# (Woodward-Kron, 2008)

Nominalisations have been identified as a feature of successful student writing (Schleppergrell, 2004a). Other less congruent realisations in academic discourse are causal meanings: causal relations tend to be realised within the clause as a Participant (e.g. the reason) or Process as in the second example above (has resulted in) rather than conjunctively between clauses (e.g. because) (Martin, 1985). This reconstrual of congruent meanings in the grammar into more incongruent grammatical categories has been identified by EAP researchers as a key component in successful student writing (author, 2008; Colombi, 2002; Drury, 1991; Jones, 1988; Schleppergrell, 2004a, 2004b).

# 3.3. Description of the analytical framework and procedure

The analytical framework outlines the tool for examining the identified learning processes mediated through writing. These processes are i) reasoning and explaining ii) reporting knowledge claims and constructing disciplinary knowledge, and iii) engaging with disciplinary knowledge/becoming a teacher.

# i) Reasoning and explaining

In this study, the analysis of reasoning and explaining was limited to discussion of explanations addressing the questions of ‘why’ and ‘how’ in the students’ texts, and did not include conditional, concessive, or temporal relations. The analysis focussed on causal relations of reason, result and purpose, and the manner relation of means. The analysis was guided in part by Halliday’s (1985/1994) summary of categories for expansion of the clause for ‘Cause’ and ‘Manner’ and possible but not exhaustive list of lexicogrammatical realisations for these meanings. An overview of these categories, adapted from Halliday, is provided in Table 2.

The whole texts were included in the analysis and instances of reasoning counted. Averages were calculated for the amount of reasoning in the lower scoring texts and the higher scoring texts. The lexicogrammatical resources chosen by the students to express reasoning are presented in the results section.

# ii) Reporting knowledge claims and constructing disciplinary knowledge

In this study ‘reporting knowledge claims and constructing disciplinary knowledge’ refers to the ways in which students incorporated the arguments, views, and beliefs of theorists in the field. The term ‘constructing disciplinary knowledge’ has been adopted as students are not only reporting beliefs and theories but in their lexical choices may indicate an awareness of the constructed and contested nature of disciplinary knowledge.

Preliminary analysis of the students’ texts showed that there were many instances in which the explanations of phenomena were built up by reporting the beliefs and views of theorists in the field. The students drew on a number of grammatical resources to report these knowledge claims. For analytical purposes, these grammatical resources were grouped into the broad categories of human Participant, for example, Vygotsky argued, according to Vygotsky; or abstract Participant (Woodward-Kron, 2008), for example, belief, view, theory. To reiterate, ‘Participant’ is a functional label to refer to one of the constituents in a clause (i.e. Participant, Process, Circumstance). The Participant is realised by a nominal group, in this instance, either a person (human Participant), or an abstract entity (abstract Participant). The analysis did not take into account the students’ referencing choices such as integral or non-integral citations (Swales, 1990) as this was beyond the scope of the current investigation. The lexicogrammatical resources utilised to report knowledge claims were counted for each text. Averages for the amount of reporting per text for the lower scoring students and the higher scoring students were calculated.

# iii) Engaging with disciplinary knowledge/becoming a teacher

‘Engaging with disciplinary knowledge’ is used in this paper as a superordinate term. It refers to students’ involvement in disciplinary practices such as applying theories to the classroom, observing and interpreting children’s development with the insights of child development theories, and evaluating disciplinary knowledge from the perspective of a future teacher. As with the previous sections, the analytical procedure involved taking the whole texts into consideration, identifying the lexicogrammatical resources for engaging with disciplinary knowledge, and counting these instances. In terms of lexicogrammar, the analysis was mainly restricted to ideational meanings, ie. the representation of experience; however, the analysis did consider some interpersonal meanings such as modality to realise recommendations (e.g. teachers should consider).

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>COHESION Between clause</td><td colspan="3">COHESION between clauses in a clause complex</td><td>Circumstance in clause</td><td>Participant -</td><td>Process</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>complexes</td><td>paratactic</td><td>hypotactic</td><td> non-finite clause</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CAUSE: reason</td><td>Therefore</td><td>so, for</td><td>because</td><td>with, by</td><td>because of</td><td>reason</td><td>means</td></tr><tr><td>CAUSE: result</td><td>Consequently</td><td>thus</td><td></td><td>as a result of</td><td></td><td></td><td>result, cause</td></tr><tr><td>CAUSE: purpose</td><td>To that end</td><td></td><td>in order that</td><td>(so as) to, for</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>MANNER: means</td><td>Thus</td><td></td><td></td><td>By</td><td>by, with</td><td>The way</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Classifying criteria were informed by a preliminary analysis. The overarching criteria were i) explicit engagement, which referred to subjective, personalised forms of engagement and included the first person pronoun, for example, as a teacher, I... ; and ii) implicit engagement, which refers to a more impersonal form of engagement, for example when evaluation is realised adjectivally it is also important to develop the students’ skills. These overarching classification criteria were further subdivided into a further four categories. One was identification: this referred to the students’ identification of themselves as teachers or future teachers. This category was sometimes linked to a recommendation. A further form of engagement was stance: the sub-category stance refers to students’ stance towards the saliency of theories and their applicability towards classroom practice. The final sub-category of engagement is ‘understanding’. This refers to expressions of the cognitive processes of reflecting and understanding, for example, I have gained knowledge. In summary, the main and sub-categories for the analysis of ‘engaging with disciplinary knowledge/ becoming a teacher’ are:

EXPLICIT ENGAGEMENT:   
Identification; recommendation; stance; understanding   
IMPLICIT ENGAGEMENT:   
Recommendation; stance; understanding

# 4. Results and discussion

The description of the results includes the unedited examples from the students’ texts to show the wide range of lexicogrammatical resources the students drew on to reason and explain; to report knowledge claims; and to engage with disciplinary knowledge. These examples include a description of the word class or grammatical choices in modified systemic terminology. The grammatical descriptions have been provided to distinguish between the congruent and incongruent realisations.

# 4.1. Reasoning and explaining

The students drew on a range of lexicogrammatical resources to show causal relations of reason, result, purpose and manner (means). Examples of these resources are provided below. In each example, the reasoning or explaining term is in bold.

# CAUSE: REASON2

i) conjunction between clause complexes: $\searrow$ therefore, hence It is also important to develop the students’ skills of generating possibilities and not just single solutions. It is therefore vital for the teacher to provide opportunities for the children to think divergently.   
ii) conjunction between clauses in a clause complex: $\searrow$ so, for, because, as This approach is promising because it challenges students .   
iii) preposition with a non-finite clause: $\searrow$ by, with By suggesting there are seven forms of intelligence I think, this is a way of including more children in to the intelligent category   
iv) prepositionþnominal group as Circumstance: $\searrow$ because of because of this belief a teacher would provide stimulus for the child.   
v) nominal group as Participant: $\searrow$ reason The main reason [[that the controversy still exists]] .   
vi) rankshifted reasoning clause as participant in the clause: The main reason [[that the controversy still exists]] is [[because ‘‘researchers do not agree on how hereditary and environment influence intelligence and personality’’]].

vii) process in the clause: $\searrow$ means In terms of the classroom, this means that learning must be developed in which students with different strengths are each able to shine.

viii) prepositionþnominal group as circumstance in the clause: $\searrow$ as a result of, due to this adaptation begins at birth as the result of natural biological development and experiences with the world   
ix) process in the clause: $\searrow$ result in, cause, affect Many theorists have examined these questions and expressed different opinions on the issue,which, with no doubt, will result in a more thorough understanding of child development.   
x) nominal group as Participant: $\searrow$ effect, consequences the strong effect [[that nurture has on the developing individual]]

The results for the frequency of reasoning and explaining and ways in which reasoning and explaining were realised in the students’ texts are shown in Figure 1. This figure shows the averages for each type of reasoning for the lower scoring texts (abbreviated to Av. LS in table), and the higher scoring texts (Av. HS). Totals are also given for the average frequency of reasoning in the lower scoring texts and in the higher scoring texts. The results for reasoning and explaining are discussed in terms of the amount of reasoning in the students’ texts, the differences between the amount of reasoning in the lower and the higher scoring texts, the differences between the first and third year texts, and the type of lexicogrammatical choices the students made to reason.

The results for the first year texts given in the first two columns of Figure 1 show that the higher scoring students included more reasoning in their texts on average than the lower scoring texts. The average frequency of instances of reasoning in the higher scoring texts was 23.2 compared to 17.8 in the lower scoring texts. In the third year texts (the final two columns in Figure 1) there was a marked increase in reasoning both in the lower scoring texts and the higher scoring texts compared to the first year results. In the lower scoring texts reasoning increased from 17.8 instances to 32.5 whereas in the higher scoring texts reasoning increased from 23.2 in first year to 43.7. While the length of the third year essays compared to the first year texts no doubt contributed to this increase, it needs to be taken into account that the first year essay was explicitly concerned with cause and effect relationships (the influence of nature and nurture on child development). In other words, the results for the first year texts were possibly higher than would have been expected with an essay topic less focussed on causality.

As Figure 1 shows, the various realisations of reasoning and explaining were used as the means to measure the amount and types of reasoning in the students’ texts. This detail allowed the monitoring of any differences in distribution of congruent and incongruent construals of reasoning as discussed in the methods section of this paper. Martin (for example,

1985) argues that the most congruent realisation of reasoning is through conjunctive relations. The most congruent construals are indicated with asterisks $( ^ { * } )$ in the figures. The results for the first year texts show that the students construed reasoning both congruently between clauses through conjunctive relations such as therefore and because, and incongruently within clauses with reasoning construed as Participant, Process or Circumstance. Both the lower scoring students and the higher scoring students utilised more congruent construals of reasoning (cause: reason) than incongruent ones. This finding was repeated in the third year results. However the construal of manner: means in the first year texts was equally realised congruently and incongruently, while in the third year texts this relation was construed more frequently as a participant in the clause i.e. incongruently (e.g. the way.). This finding applies to both the lower and higher scoring texts.

In this educational context, the language of reasoning and explaining is particularly important for interpreting theories of child development and transferring those theories to the classroom. In the students’ texts reasoning and explaining featured in discussions of the causes of child development, the consequences for teaching practices, and the ways in which learning can be fostered in the classroom. The numerical results suggest that reasoning and explaining took on an increasingly significant role the further the students advanced in their studies. The numerical results also suggest that there was little difference between the degrees of congruent and incongruent realisations of reasoning between the low scoring students and the high scoring students. Both the lower scoring students as well as the higher scoring students used the congruent conjunctions to explicitly signal causality connecting clause complexes. Both sets of students, however, also implicitly coded reasoning inside the clause in the form of Participants, Processes and Circumstances.

In terms of the students’ learning through writing, the more implicit, incongruent realisation has a number of implications. Firstly, in terms of persuasive force of the argument, the argument is less negotiable as a nominal group or process than when it is explicitly coded between clause complexes. Burying reason in this way and making it less open to negotiation is a feature of adult expository writing (Martin, 1985; Schleppergrell, 2004b). Secondly, reasoning in the form of nominal groups such as the reason or the way has an important function in organising discourse. For example in Annie’s 2001 HD scoring text, she uses the way to introduce and keep track of various teaching strategies:

52. The most effective ways of teaching these strategies include teaching modelling, scaffolded instruction, peer   
learning in the zone of proximal development and autonomous, spontaneous learning and reflection (citation).   
53. Many of these recommendations link directly to the supportive classroom [[encouraged by Vygotsky’s theory]].   
54. [[Encouraging creativity in the classroom]] is another way of challenging students.   
55. While Czikszentmihalyi’s theory of big C creativity has definite applications in the wider world (or rather its   
specialist domains)   
56. I cannot see its applications to the classroom   
57. Little c creativity, on the other hand, should be encouraged,   
58. and this could be done through the choice and range of activities in the classroom.   
59. It is also important [[to develop the students skill of generating possibilities and not just single solutions]].   
60. It is therefore vital for the teacher [[to provide opportunities for children to think divergently,   
61. which could mean adopting different questioning techniques.   
62. Another way [[to encourage creative thinking]] is .

The third implication has to do with relational clause grammar. In the above excerpt the nominal groups the way. are related to other phenomena through identifying relational clause grammar. In other words, more incongruent realisations of reasoning allow the students to expand their meaning potential and extend their thinking and learning.

The final observation on reasoning and explaining concerns a configuration which shall be referred to as this means that.. This configuration occurred with the most frequency in Annie’s third year text, and in that text it appeared to have an interpretive as well as a summing up function:

# A classroom that supports the students

70. A supportive classroom is one where students are recognised and valued as individuals with different strengths and weaknesses, different abilities, and different talents.   
71. Howard Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences is particularly useful [[in thinking of a supportive classroom]].   
72. Although it is not a learning styles theory,   
73. it does help for students to recognise the blend of intelligences which they possess.   
74. it helps students and teachers to recognise each individual as intelligent in some way,   
75. it does not place more value on one particular intelligence as compared to another.   
76. In terms of the classroom, this means [[that learning must be developed in which students with different strengths are each able to shine.]]

The reference item this in the relational clause 76 refers anaphorically to the five preceding clauses describing the general applications of Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences, while the that part of the configuration introduces a rankshifted clause functioning as a participant. The Process part of the configuration means has a strong interpretive function, linking the theory through a causal process to classroom practice. In other words the configuration this means that allows this student to do a considerable amount of analytical and interpretive work through the lexicogrammar.

# 4.2. Constructing disciplinary knowledge: the role of reporting

The description of the results in this section is organised into the broad categories of human Participant, or abstract Participant.

The grammatical resources realising reported knowledge claims with human Participants were: (i) circumstantial elements of angle, and (ii) specific human and generic human participants plus mental or saying process (believed, stated etc.).

HUMAN PARTICIPANTS

i) circumstance (angle) with human Participant   
ii) human Participant and mental (believed) or saying (stated) Process Both Piaget and Vygotsky believed that.

Lexicogrammatical choices with abstract Participants were: (iii) generic abstract participants (includes passive voice constructions omitting the agent); as well as (iv) nominalisations of mental and cognitive processes (beliefs, view etc). Reported knowledge claims were also realised through nominal groups configured as abstract Participant with a human deictic (v). This category includes circumstantial elements of angle with an abstract Participant. For example:

# ABSTRACT PARTICIPANTS

iii) abstract Participant

According to Vygotsky Research shows; nature is thought to be   
iv) nominalisations Piaget takes a different view; This belief in make-believe play.   
v) Abstract Participant with human Deictic as part of the nominal group structure Sternberg’s triarchic theory shows

The results for first year texts on reported knowledge claims are shown in Table 3.

Both the lower scoring and higher scoring students drew on a range of lexicogrammatical resources to report the views and beliefs of theorists in the field. Students utilised congruent construals of reporting with human Participants and mental or verbal Process (e.g. Piaget believed). They also utilised more incongruent ones in which the mental or verbal Process was nominalised (Piaget’s approach). Furthermore, both sets of students construed the ideas and beliefs of theorists through abstract Participants such as Gardner’s theory. A considerable increase in the frequency of both congruent and incongruent choices was evident between the first and third year texts.

The presence of reporting in all the students’ texts suggests that reporting beliefs and views is intrinsic to disciplinary knowledge building in undergraduate teacher education. The presence of reporting also attests to the students’ awareness of the constructed nature of disciplinary knowledge. That is, the congruent lexicogrammatical realisations with their human participants explicitly emphasise theorists’ and empirical researchers’ contribution to disciplinary knowledge (e.g. Piaget believed, according to Vygotsky). This is also the case with the incongruent realisations as some of these nominal groups retain the human Participant construed as a deictic or classifying element (e.g. the Piagetian view). The abstract realisations (e.g. principles, concepts, theories) mostly retained a human Participant in either the pre or post-modifier of the nominal group. Indeed, the reporting of knowledge claims as established facts through fact-like reporting Processes with generic abstract Participants (e.g. research shows) was rare in this data set.

The results also suggest that students were aware to some degree of the contested nature of disciplinary knowledge. The choice of mental and verbal Processes such as believed, argued, acknowledged and their corresponding nominalisations allow for the possibility that the views and beliefs the students were presenting would not be the explanations that the student would ultimately accept. That is, the choice of belief, or view allows for the possibility of competing theoretical perspectives. Furthermore, presenting theoretical perspectives as Participants allowed the student to link the perspective of one theorist through relational clause grammar to other perspectives. For example:

Piaget’s theories stand in direct contrast to the behaviourists.   
Guilford is one of the theorists [[supporting the psychometric view]].

In the students’ texts there was ample evidence to suggest that the students were aware of the contested nature of much disciplinary knowledge. However, there was only a small amount of evidence in the texts such as in the example below to suggest that they understood the role of debate in contributing to new understandings and disciplinary knowledge.

12. So, how is it to be known [[which aspect of the controversy is more influential on a child’s development   
13. Or perhaps there should be no controversy at all,   
14. and both aspects should remain independent.   
15. Many theorists have examined these questions   
16. and expressed different opinions on the issue,   
17. which, with no doubt, will result in a more thorough understanding of child development.

# 4.3. Engaging with disciplinary knowledge/becoming a teacher

Throughout the trainee teachers’ degree the lecturers and tutors encouraged the students to make connections between theory and practice, to judge the saliency of theories, and to consider the implications for their own classroom (Woodward-Kron, 2003). The students’ engagement with disciplinary knowledge was both explicit and implicit.

One way in which the students’ explicit engagement was realised textually was through the identification of themselves as teachers or future teachers (as a teacher, I.). This was construed grammatically as a Circumstance of role and first person pronoun as participant or through a circumstance of location (i). This circumstantial information was often linked to statements of recommendations of what the students should do or needed to do as teachers. These statements were realised through modalised Processes with the first person pronoun as Participant (ii), for example I should. A further explicit form of engagement was statements about the students’ stance towards the saliency of theories and their applicability to classroom practice. These statements were mostly realised through Processes with the first person pronoun as Participant. Stance statements with first person Participant also functioned to agree or disagree with theoretical positions. Less congruent realisations were relational Processes with a nominalised mental Process as Participant, and rank-shifted mental Processes as post modifiers in nominal groups (iii). A similar kind of explicit engagement was ‘understanding’. This refers to the cognitive processes of reflecting and understanding that some students made explicit through mental processes (iv).

EXPLICIT REALISATIONS: identification; recommendation; stance; understanding

i) identification realised through Circumstance of role and first person pronoun as Participant as a teacher, I. identification realised through Circumstance of location with possessive pronoun as deictic in nominal group In my classroom.   
ii) Recommendations realised through modulated Processes with first person pronoun as Participant As a teacher.., I need to assist students by training them . As teachers we should encompass the view of many of many of today’s theorists   
iii) Stance statements realised through a range of Process types with first person pronoun as Participant (congruent meanimgs) I believe that a teacher must understand that the children’s development is a result of

their hereditary factors and the environment I am slightly critical of his notion of stages (less congruent meanings) my criticism of a strong logical, mathematical aspect of the theory Another way [[that I think would be really good to motivate children on a topic]] iv) ‘Understanding’ statements realised through mental processes and relational processes with first person pronoun as Participant I have gained knowledge

The numerical results for the explicit instances of engaging with disciplinary knowledge are summarised in Table 4.1.

The results for explicit engagement show that a personal, subjective form of engagement is an intrinsic part of the undergraduate trainee teachers’ writing. The third year results showed a marked increase in the amount of engagement in the students’ texts. In the first year texts there was no specific area in which the students’ engagement was concentrated. In the third year texts, however, the overwhelmingly predominant form of explicit engagement was stance as students made judgements about the saliency of theories and their applicability to the students’ future teaching practices.

The students also engaged with disciplinary knowledge in more implicit ways. The implicit dimension of the students’ engagement was evident in the students’ more incongruent lexicogrammatical choices. For example, in the implicit form of recommendations, passive voice constructions functioned to omit human agency in the recommendations. Furthermore, the recommendations of obligation and necessity were modulated through should (v), or realised incongruently as an attribute in a relational clause (vi). Recommendations also featured as rank-shifted clauses functioning as participants in relational clauses. In these relational clauses, the recommendation was often linked to a causal explanation, again realised incongruently as a nominal group (vii).

# IMPLICIT RECOMMENDATIONS:

v) modulated expressions of obligation and necessity with abstract subject and passive voice Little c creativity, on the other hand, should be encouraged   
vi) command construed incongruently as an attribute It is also important to develop the students’ skill of generating possibilities and just single solutions   
vii) command construed incongruently as a rank-shifted act functioning as participant in a relational clause or as post modifier in a nominal group Encouraging creativity in the classroom is another way of challenging students.

The students also made implicit judgements about the saliency of the theories and their applicability to the students’ future teaching practices. These judgements were expressed impersonally through relational clause grammar with either nominalisations or qualities as Participants or abstract Participants (viii). Implicit stance statements were also realised through relational clause grammar with an adjective as attribute (ix).

IMPLICIT STANCE:

viii) nominal groups with nominalised process Big c creativity has definite applications ix) attributive relational clauses The modelling shown in Bandura’s study is also important for teaching.

As in the explicit forms of engagement students incorporated generalised statements of their own understanding about child development issues. The implicit realisations of this form of engagement were attributes in relational processes (ix).

IMPLICIT ‘UNDERSTANDING’ STATEMENTS:

$x$ ) attributive relational processes it is important [[to construct our own belief and ideals .]]

The numerical results for the implicit forms of disciplinary engagement are shown in Table 4.2

The results for the third year texts show that implicit forms of engagement are a prominent feature of the students’ texts. All the students included incongruent forms of recommending and evaluating statements about the saliency of theories and their applicability to classroom contexts. The most common form of incongruent recommendation was impersonal modulated processes, while the most common form of incongruent evaluation was metaphorical nominalised processes or qualities (e.g. tremendous help), or abstract Participants (e.g. an important concept). A comparison of the average amount of engagement for the lower scoring and higher scoring first and third year texts is shown in Table 4.3. This table shows the averages for both explicit and implicit forms of engagement.

As can be seen from Table 4.3 there was a substantial increase in the amount of both explicit and implicit engagement between the first and third year texts. This increase can in part be attributed to the increased length of the third year texts and to the third year assignment task, which required students to evaluate theories for classroom practice. The increase, however, reflects the disciplinary concern with linking theory to practice. At the outset of the students’ studies, explicit and implicit forms of engagement featured in the students’ texts, but they were a minor presence. By third year, however, the students gained sufficient disciplinary knowledge in order to survey the field and make informed connections between theory and classroom practice. The results for the averages also show that both explicit and implicit forms of engagement were equally represented in both the lower scoring and the higher scoring students’ texts. This finding suggests that both the lower scoring and higher scoring students chose to identify themselves explicitly as future teachers and make available their own evaluations of theories for classroom practice. The finding also shows that all the students were able link theories to evaluations and applications, and to evaluative explanations. In other words, all the students were able to expand their meaning potential by utilising the potential of relational clause grammar.

# 5. Conclusion and implications

This paper has provided a clause level examination of $\mathrm { L } _ { 1 }$ Education students’ writing from the perspective of learning through writing. The findings provide insights into the ways in which students learn disciplinary knowledge through writing as well as provide insights into the discourse of child development and teaching as it was instantiated in the students’ texts. The results also provide comprehensive, authentic descriptions of the range of lexicogrammatical resources through which students can reason, report knowledge claims and engage with disciplinary knowledge and practices.

In her ‘Language as academic purpose’ paper, Turner (2004) argues for a shift in conceptualisation in EAP from ‘‘language as instrument to language as constitutive’’ (p. 95). This paper’s focus on learning through writing is a linguistic account of learning which views language as constitutive of meaning. Its clause level descriptions of both congruent and incongruent grammatical choices to reason, engage with disciplinary knowledge, and report knowledge claims can help EAP practitioners to assist students with not only learning to write, but with writing to learn.
