# ABSTRACT

The study sought to understand the general trajectory of children’s executive function, as well as whether there was heterogeneity among monolingual English-speaking and dual language learning children in their growth of executive function. In addition, the study examined whether monolingual English-speaking and dual language learning children demonstrated different developmental trajectories in their executive function development. Two executive function measures, the Peg Tapping and the Dimensional Change Card Sort Task, were used in the study. Findings of 122 children (Mean $\mathsf { a g e } = 3 . 6 8$ years; $5 7 \%$ monolingual English speaking, $4 3 \%$ dual language learning) showed there was linear growth on children’s executive function. Both monolingual English-speaking and dual language learning children varied significantly in their initial level of executive function and in their growth rate of executive function over time. In addition, monolingual English-speaking children demonstrated higher initial levels of executive function than dual language learners, while dual language learning children showed a faster rate of growth in executive function measured by the Peg Tapping test.

# Introduction

The increased presence of linguistically and culturally diverse dual language learners (DLLs), has led to a focus on more clearly examining the development of children’ executive function in early childhood settings. Studies investigating differences between monolingual English-speaking children and DLLs in their executive function development have produced mixed results (Arizmendi et al. 2018; Castillo et al. 2022; Yang, Yang, and Lust 2011). While some studies suggest that DLLs who are exposed to more than one language display better executive function skills (Blom et al. 2014; Park, Ellis Weismer, and Kaushanskaya 2018; Tran, Arredondo, and Yoshida 2015), other studies find no bilingual advantage (Arizmendi et al. 2018). Another study by Neveu et al. (2021) found that bilingual children exhibited better inhibition in the first year but not the second, suggesting transitory effects of dual-language immersion on executive functioning. Many studies have explored executive function in monolingual English-speaking children, but DLL’s development remains less understood (Castillo et al. 2022). This study contributes to the research by highlighting the differential growth of inhibition and shifting in children across diverse linguistic backgrounds, thereby paving the way for more informed educational practice.

# Defining executive function

Executive function refers to the higher-order cognitive processes that help individuals monitor and control their thoughts and actions in order to attain goal-directed behaviors (Carlson and Meltzoff 2008). There is general agreement that there are three core executive function components: working memory, inhibition, and shifting (Diamond 2013; Miyake and Friedman 2012). Working memory refers to the ability to maintain and manipulate information over a short period of time (Lipsey et al. 2017). It helps children actively maintain information over a brief period of time in a way that prevents distraction or interference of the information (Miyake and Friedman 2012). Inhibition involves the ability to control one’s attention and suppress irrelevant information or behaviors in order to complete a task (Diamond 2013). Inhibition enables children to selectively attend and focus their attention on instruction and suppress their attention to other distractors. Shifting or switching includes the ability to flexibly switch between tasks or mental states as situations demand (Lipsey et al. 2017). This skill helps children flexibly switch their focus to pay attention to new details, thereby facilitating their learning and engagement in the classroom (McClelland et al. 2014).

For the interest of the current study, we employed two measures, the Peg Tapping (PT; Diamond and Taylor 1996) and the Dimensional Change Card Sort Task (DCCS; Zelazo 2006), to assess children’s inhibition and shifting, respectively. These measures were chosen due to their significant roles in prior research investigating the executive function of DLLs within the early childhood field (Arizmendi et al. 2018; Huang, Baker, and Schneider 2023; Schmitt et al. 2015). Existing research has shown differences between monolingual children and DLLs specifically in these two areas, making them an appropriate focus for the study (Bialystok and Martin 2004; Castillo et al. 2022; Calvo and Bialystok 2014; Neveu et al., 2021). In addition, previous studies have indicated that DLLs tend to be relatively more proficient in tasks that require conflicting rules, which require children to make a novel response while inhibiting a conflicting one (Bialystok and Craik 2022; Bialystok, Craik, and Luk 2012; Costa, Hernández, and Sebastián-Gallés 2008; Yang, Yang, and Lust 2011). The Peg Tapping and the DCCS are two widely used tasks that typically involve conflict and serve as reliable measures of children’s executive function. By adopting these measures, we aimed to understand which specific areas of executive function benefit from dual language experiences.

# The development of executive function in early childhood

Research provides evidence that there is rapid growth of executive function in the preschool years (Anderson and Reidy 2012; Carlson and Meltzoff 2008). Additionally, there are individual differences regarding the beginning level of children’s executive function skills, the time when rapid growth occurs, and the rate of change (Montroy et al. 2016; Wiebe, Sheffield, and Andrews Espy 2012). Researchers have studied the development of behavioral regulation in children aged between 3 and 7 using the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders (HTKS) task and found that some children had higher initial levels of executive function and earlier gains, whereas other children began with lower executive function levels and improved slowly (Montroy et al. 2016; Ponitz et al. 2008). Wiebe, Sheffield, and Andrews Espy (2012) investigated the development of inhibition among children aged between 3 and 5.75 years using a computerized go/no-go task, finding that the most pronounced change occurred between the ages of 3 and 3.75. Another recent study involving older children found a steeper rate of improvement in shifting from the start of kindergarten to the end of first grade, as measured by the DCCS (Castillo et al. 2022). Despite increasing evidence that preschool is a critical period for executive function development, results of research investigating children’s executive function trajectories are mixed. Some research indicated children demonstrated rapid and nonlinear gains during preschool (Montroy et al. 2016; Ponitz et al. 2008; Wiebe, Sheffield, and Andrews Espy 2012), while other studies suggested that children’s executive function growth were best described by linear-and-quadratic or an exponential curve (Montroy et al. 2016; Wanless et al. 2016).

The rapid development of children during their preschool years is well-documented, with research identifying gender as a significant determinant of executive function development. Previous studies generally indicated that girls outperformed boys in executive function (Matthews, Marulis, and Williford 2014; Matthews, Ponitz, and Morrison 2009). Ponitz et al. (2008) reported slightly higher average scores in girls compared to boys using the HTKS task, though the effect sizes were small. Wiebe, Sheffield, and Andrews Espy (2012) also discovered gender differences among children using the computerized go/no-go task, with boys excelling in quick and accurate responses on ‘go’ trials, while girls were more proficient at withholding responses on ‘no-go’ trials. This gender discrepancy was further corroborated by Montroy et al. (2016), who found that girls were more likely than boys to be categorized as early developers, characterized by higher initial levels of executive function and earlier gains. Given these findings, gender has been included as a covariate in the design of our current study.

# Executive function development in monolingual children and DLLs

Cross sectional findings on whether there are differences in executive function between monolingual children and DLLs have given rise to some mixed findings (Arizmendi et al. 2018; Carlson and Meltzoff 2008; Yang, Yang, and Lust 2011). Researchers have pointed out that the mixed results may be due to the variability of language exposure and use experienced by DLLs (Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019). For instance, while certain studies predominantly feature EnglishSpanish bilingual children (Arizmendi et al. 2018; Cao et al. 2008; Park, Ellis Weismer, and Kaushanskaya 2018), others focus on children speaking Korean (Yang, Yang, and Lust 2011) or children who reported non-English as the primary language spoken at home (Castillo et al. 2022). This posits that some language exposure or use may lead to changes in children’s cognition and affect their executive function development, while other kinds of language exposure or use may not (Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019). Furthermore, the degree of cognitive control required and the potential impact on executive function development, depends on the bilingual’s interactional context (Green and Abutalebi 2013). For example, switching between different linguistic contexts, such as switching between English and Spanish and switching between English and Mandarin, may require individuals to place different demands on the control system, which is associated with executive function process, thereby affecting children’s executive function development (Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019; Green and Abutalebi 2013). Specifically, Spanish and English, sharing the same alphabet and numerous cognates due to Latin influence, possess a phonetic decoding system based on the relationship between graphemes and phonemes. In contrast, Mandarin, as a logographic language, associates entire characters with syllables, devoid of specific phonetic components (Cao et al. 2017). According to the Adaptive Control Model proposed by Green and Abutalebi (2013), bilingual individuals constantly need to manage their two languages to communicate effectively. This requires them to engage a set of cognitive control processes to ensure the appropriate language is used at the right time, which is essentially a practice of their executive functions. Mandarin-English bilinguals might encounter more challenges and require more cognitive resources to navigate and resolve linguistic conflicts, possibly leading to a different impact on children’s executive function development.

The effect of language exposure on executive function may occur early in cognitive development and persist over development from early childhood to later childhood in a continuous manner (Arizmendi et al. 2018; Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019; Yang, Yang, and Lust 2011). Several longitudinal studies have found that bilingualism is advantageous to children’s executive function development over time (Blom et al. 2014; Tran, Arredondo, and Yoshida 2015). Park, Ellis Weismer, and Kaushanskaya (2018) found that English-Spanish speaking bilingual children demonstrated a steep improvement from year 1 to year 2 on their inhibition, as measured by the Flanker task.

Similarly, Castillo et al. (2022) found that bilingual children from kindergarten to first grade showed a faster increase in working memory and shifting, as measured by Number Reversed and DCCS. Researchers supporting that DLLs outperform monolingual children in their executive function because they routinely practice controlling their attention to switch between two languages in their daily life, thereby advancing their ability to control attention to conflicting situations as time goes (Bialystok 1999; Carlson and Meltzoff 2008). From a language learning perspective, language intrusions are prevented by holding relevant language in mind while inhibiting irrelevant language (Carlson and Meltzoff 2008). DLLs predominantly speak a language that differs from the language they learned at school and function properly in each language according to the situational needs (Bihler et al. 2018; Edyburn, Quirk, and Oliva-Olson 2019; Langeloo et al. 2019). In a dual language context, DLLs routinely pay attention to abstract dimensions of language and switch between languages, such as calling the same thing by two different terms, which is believed to trigger the highest demand for cognitive control processes that are associated with enhanced executive functions (Bialystok 1999; Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019). They need to navigate two languages and thus learn to resist irrelevant information and distraction, while focusing on relevant information, therefore performing better on executive function tasks (Wiebe and Karbach 2017). As a bilingual individual’s languages are persistently activated and interactively influence one another, the lifelong experience of constantly managing and resolving the competition between the two languages could lead to cognitive benefits. These benefits emerge when nonlinguistic processing taps into the same brain networks used for executive control (Antoniou 2019). Consequently, bilingual children who frequently grapple with the unique demands of managing two languages, tend to demonstrate superior executive functioning compared to other monolingual children. If the experience of learning more than one language affects children’s executive function development, it would be noteworthy to investigate the developmental trajectory of executive function among monolingual and DLLs.

# The current study

The first aim of the study was to understand the general trajectory of children’s executive function. Previous studies have suggested that children’s executive function development typically followed either linear or quadratic trajectories (Montroy et al. 2016; Wanless et al. 2016). Based on these findings, linear and quadratic growth were tested in the current study. We expected that there would be linear growth on children’s executive function, and there would be heterogeneity among children on their growth of executive function during preschool period. Our second aim was to examine whether monolingual English-speaking and dual language learning children demonstrated different developmental trajectories in their executive functioning. Based on existing literature, we hypothesized that DLLs demonstrate higher initial level of executive function and more accelerated growth in executive function development compared to monolingual English-speaking children.

# Methods

# Participants

The current study included children participating in a larger project from 2017 to 2019 (Nores et al. 2018; 2019). Analyses were restricted to children who participated in both years of the study and had completed a full battery of assessments. The final sample included 122 children enrolled in 30 classrooms in preschools or family childcare centers in a large urban area in the North Western part of the United States. During the first time of testing in Fall of 2017, children averaged 3.68 years of age (SD $= 0 . 2 9 )$ ) with $56 \%$ female and $4 4 \%$ male. Of the 122 children for whom information on race/ethnicity was available, $34 \%$ were Asian, $3 2 \%$ were Black or African American, $1 4 \%$ were Hispanic or Latino,

$1 1 \%$ were White, $8 \%$ reported having two or more races and $1 \%$ were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Children were classified as DLLs according to parents’ or caregivers’ report. In the current study, if children spoke a language other than English as their primary language at home, they were classified as dual language learners, otherwise, children were classified as monolingual English-speaking children. Based on parent/caregiver report, among these children, $5 7 \%$ spoke English as their primary language at home, while $4 3 \%$ spoke languages, such as Chinese, Spanish, Vietnamese, or other languages as their primary language at home. Annual household income was reported by 101 families, with $1 8 \%$ reporting household incomes lower than $\$ 25,000$ , $3 1 \%$ between $\$ 25,000$ and $\$ 50,000$ , $23 \%$ between $\$ 50,000$ and $\$ 75,000$ , $9 \%$ above $\$ 75,000$ , representing a mixed socioeconomic status.

# Procedure

Children were assessed four times from 2017 to 2019, with a range of 182–186 days across each time point. Child measures were administered in direct, one-on-one interaction with a trained data collector. Children were asked to consent to participate prior to the administration of assessment. All assessments were conducted in English in a quiet place in the school. To minimize language demands of the task, children were given several trials to make sure that they understand the task in order to process the formal assessment. The assessments were aborted if children failed to pass the trials.

# Measures

# Peg tapping test (PT)

The Peg Tapping Test (PT; Diamond and Taylor 1996) was used to measure children’s inhibition. Administration requires children to tap once when the assessor taps twice and tap twice when the assessor taps once. A total of 16 trials are conducted with 8 one-tap and 8 two-tap trials in random sequence. Children received a score of 1 if they correctly respond to each trial and 0 if they respond incorrectly. The final score for the Peg Tapping Test is a sum of all the 16 items that comprise the test. Children need to correctly respond to two consecutive trials in order to continue to the formal assessment, otherwise, the assessment is abandoned.

Cronbach’s alpha is a statistical estimator used to assess the reliability of a psychometric test (Cronbach 1951). It evaluates the test’s internal consistency, reflecting the extent to which all the items in a test measure the same construct (Streiner 2003). It is presented as a value between 0 and 1, with a higher value suggesting that the items in the test are highly correlated (Tavakol and Dennick 2011). The Peg Tapping Test has been shown to have good Cronbach alphas of .82 in preschool (Blair and Razza 2007), and good reliabilities of .87–.88 (Lipsey et al. 2017) and moderate construct validity with other teacher ratings of executive function $r = . 4 2$ (Lipsey et al. 2017) and executive function task, $r = . 4 2$ (HTKS; Fuhs, Farran, and Nesbitt 2015).

# Dimensional Change Card Sort Task

The DCCS Task (Zelazo 2006) was used to measure children’s attention shifting. There are a total of 24 test items across the tasks, with 6 items for the first two subtests and 12 for the last subtest. During the first two subtests, children are asked to sort the cards based on different colors and shapes, respectively. If children respond correctly to five or more items on the first subtest, children are given the next subtask. Children receive a score of 1 if they sort the card correctly and 0 if they sort incorrectly. Scores range from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating more advanced levels of executive function. Given the diversity of language experience in the sample of the current study, children were given two trials before each subtest to ensure that children understand the task. The DCCS has been shown to have good Cronbach alphas from .90 to .93. and test-retest reliability $r = . 6 3$ (McClelland et al. 2014).

# Missing data

There were no missing data in chidren’s demographic information including child age, primary language, race, and gender. However, there were missing data to varying degrees for each time point and variable (Table 1). For both tasks, the missingness ranges from $2 \%$ $( N = 2 )$ to $1 6 \%$ $( N =$ 20). The missing data were due to child absence or child being unable to pass the training items, causing the assessment to be aborted.

# Data analysis

This study was a secondary data analysis from a larger project conducted in a major urban area in the northwestern US. All analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (R Development Core Team, 2021). The growth curve models using multilevel modeling with a random intercept and a random slope was conducted using the lme4 package to test the research questions (Bates et al. 2015). One of the advantages of multilevel modeling is its ability to utilize available data from an incomplete sample without reducing the sample size as do other approaches for modeling longitudinal data, nor does it require missing data methods (Finch, Bolin, and Kelley 2019).

The data were transformed into long-data format, with multiple rows per observation representing different time points (Brauer and Curtin 2018). Time was coded as 0, 1, 2, 3 to represent the data collection periods from Time 1 to Time 4. Children’s gender and language status were dummycoded. Raw total scores were employed in the analysis as recommended for longitudinal data analysis (Moeller 2015). Utilizing raw scores allows us to preserve the characteristics of the original data, enabling us to understand children’s initial executive function levels and examine mean-level changes from one time point to another. This approach also aids in interpretation of the results (Moeller 2015). Data were grand-mean centered, facilitating comparisons between individuals and the overall mean of the entire sample (Finch, Bolin, and Kelley 2019). Due to the nested data structure, with time (level 1) nested within children (level 2) nested within classroom (level 3), three-level multilevel models with random intercept and slope were tested. However, the full random effects model produced a singular fit, suggesting that the model was overly complex for the available data set (Brauer and Curtin 2018). Maintaining the random intercept and slope model is crucial in the context of the current study as they capture the between-group variability and rates of changes over time, which are our primary research interests. Given the limited variance explained by the third level (class) $( | \mathsf { C C } \le 0 . 0 5 )$ and the relatively small sample size within each class $\mathtt { \backslash \le 7 }$ children in each class), we achieved model convergence by reducing the three-level structure to twolevel structure, as indicated by the goodness-of-fit criteria (Brauer and Curtin 2018; Finch and French 2011; González-Romá and Hernández 2017; Matuschek et al. 2017).

An unconditional model (Model 0), with intercept only was fitted first to examine the variance in executive function that is explained by individuals (children). To understand the general trajectory of children’s executive function and the heterogeneity among children, a random intercept and random slope model (Model 1), with gender as covariate, separately for Peg Tapping and DCCS

$$
\mathsf { L e v e l } \ 1 { : } E F _ { t i } = \pi _ { 0 i } + \pi _ { 1 i } ( T i m e _ { t i } ) + e _ { t i }
$$

$$
\pi _ { 1 i } = \beta _ { 1 0 } + \beta _ { 1 1 } ( F e m a l e _ { i } ) + r _ { 1 i }
$$

where $E F _ { t i }$ is the executive function score for child $i$ at time t. $\pi _ { O i }$ represents child i’s executive function level in the beginning of the data collection period where $\mathsf { T i m } \mathsf { e } _ { t i }$ is $0 ; \pi _ { 1 j }$ is the growth rate for child i during the data collection period and reflects child $i ^ { \prime } s$ predicted rate of growth on the executive function. Children’s gender was entered into the model as the control variables at level 2. $r _ { O i }$ and $r _ { 1 j }$ are the random effects for a child’s initial status and slope, which allows the growth to vary across children.

Finally, to investigate whether DLLs and English-speaking children demonstrate different developmental trajectories on their executive function, an interaction model which included the interaction of time and children’s language status was added (Model 2):

$$
\mid 2 \colon \pi _ { 0 i } = \beta _ { 0 0 } + \beta _ { 0 1 } ( \mathit { L a n g u a g e S t a t u s } _ { i } ) + \beta _ { 0 2 } ( \mathit { F e m a l e } _ { i } ) + r _ { 0 i }
$$

$$
\pi _ { 1 i } = \beta _ { 1 0 } + \beta _ { 1 1 } ( L a n g u a g e S t a t u s _ { i } ) + \beta _ { 1 2 } ( F e m a l e _ { i } ) + r _ { 1 i }
$$

where $E F _ { t i }$ is the executive function score for child $i$ at time t. $\pi _ { O i }$ represents a child $i ^ { \prime } s$ executive function level at the beginning of the data collection period where $\mathrm { T i m } \mathsf { e } _ { t i }$ is $0 ; \pi _ { 1 j }$ is the growth rate for child i during the data collection period and reflects child $i ^ { \prime } s$ predicted rate of growth on the executive function. Both $\pi _ { O i }$ and $\pi _ { 1 j }$ are allowed to vary at level 2 as a function of children’s language status. $r _ { O i }$ and $r _ { 1 j }$ are the random effects for a child’s initial status and slope, which allow the growth to vary across children.

# Results

# Descriptive statistics of executive function

As shown in Table 2, on average, children demonstrated growth in executive function and there were individual differences on their initial status and growth rate as measured by Peg Tapping and DCCS. In addition, there were positive correlations on Peg Tapping and DCCS between each time point (Table 3).

# Development of executive function

The final models were determined based on AIC, BIC, and the log-likelihood information criteria, with smaller values indicating that the model has better fit (Van der Nest et al., 2020). For Peg Tapping, the changes in children’s inhibition were best described by the linear with interaction model (Table 4). Accordingly, there is a linear relationship between time and children’s inhibition, and children’s growth of inhibition differs across language status. For DCCS, the changes in children’s shifting were best described by the linear model, indicating that there is linear growth on children’s shifting. However, children’s growth of shifting did not differ across language status.

# General trajectory of children’s executive function

An empty model (Model 0 – PT) was fitted and $3 2 \%$ of the variance in the Peg Tapping scores was accounted for by differences between children. Children had an average of 5.9 score on Peg Tapping across the four times. A linear model (Model 1 – PT) was fitted to understand the overall trajectory of children’s inhibition as measured by Peg Tapping (Table 5). Overall, children averaged 0.89 on their Peg Tapping at baseline and increased 2.65 score in inhibition every six months on average. Additionally, children varied significantly in their inhibition in the beginning of the data collection period, with 2.82 score difference from the grand mean. Accordingly, a child whose Peg Tapping score is one point above the overall average is expected to have a score of 3.71 score in the beginning of the data collection period. Also, children varied significantly in their growth of inhibition, with 1.08 difference from the grand mean.

Similarly, an empty model (Model 0 – DCCS) was fitted and $34 \%$ of the variance in the DCCS was accounted for by differences between children. Children had an average of 10.99 score on DCCS across four times. A linear model (Model 1 – DCCS) was fitted to understand the overall trajectory of children’s shifting as measured by DCCS (Table 5). Overall, children averaged 6.75 on their DCCS at baseline and increased 2.29 score in shifting every six months on average. Additionally, children varied significantly in their shifting at the beginning of the data collection period, with 3.08 score difference from the grand mean. Accordingly, a child whose DCCS score is one point above the overall average is expected to have a score of 9.83 score at the beginning of the data collection period. Also, children varied significantly in their growth of shifting, with 0.98 difference from the grand mean.

# Heterogeneity in executive function among English-speaking children and DLLs

As shown in Table 5, children increased 3.06 scores on their Peg Tapping every six months, on average, holding all else constant (Model 2 – PT). Monolingual English-speaking children were predicted to have 1.69 higher scores compared to DLLs on their Peg Tapping. In addition, monolingual children were predicted to have 0.7 fewer scores every six months compared to DLLs, holding all else constant. As shown in Figure 1, monolingual children tended to have a higher initial level of Peg Tapping than DLLs. However, DLLs tended to have a faster rate of growth on their Peg Tapping during the data collection period compared to monolingual children. Similarly, children increased 2.49 scores on their shifting measured by DCCS every six months, on average, holding all else constant (Model 2 – DCCS). Monolingual English-speaking children were predicted to have 1.12 higher scores compared to DLLs on their DCCS; however, this was not significant $( \beta = 1 . 1 2 , p > . 5 )$ . Also, there was no significant difference between monolingual English-speaking children and DLLs on their growth of shifting measured by DCCS $( \beta = - . 3 3 , p > . 5 )$ .

# Discussion

The primary goal of the current study was to understand the trajectory of children’s executive function in early childhood and whether there was heterogeneity among early childhood learners in their executive function development. In addition, the current study evaluated whether there was a difference between monolingual English-speaking children and DLLs in their executive function development. Overall, findings from both executive function measures indicated that executive function rapidly increased during preschool years. There was heterogeneity among children in their growth on the Peg Tapping task and the DCCS. In addition, there were differences between monolingual English-speaking children and DLLs in their inhibition development as measured by the Peg Tapping.

Interaction between Time and Language Status on Executive Function (PT).

We found that there was linear growth on children’s executive function during their preschool years across monolingual English-speaking children and DLLs. This result was consistent with previous studies that have indicated a steady increase in children’s executive function between the ages of 42 and 72 months (Wanless et al. 2011; 2016). Additionally, children in this study varied significantly in their initial level and growth rate of inhibition and attention shifting. These results are in line with previous findings indicating heterogeneity across children in their development (Anderson and Reidy 2012; Montroy et al. 2016; Wanless et al. 2011). However, it is important to note that research in this area is limited and more longitudinal studies are needed to examine the trajectory of different executive function constructs over time.

The study did not find that DLLs demonstrated higher initial levels of inhibition but had a faster rate of growth than monolingual English-speaking children in their inhibition as measured by the Peg Tapping test. This fits with previous findings indicating that there were no bilingual advantages in inhibition at initial levels (Park, Ellis Weismer, and Kaushanskaya 2018; Wanless et al. 2011). Yet, the findings were consistent with previous studies indicating that bilingual children outperformed monolingual children in their use of inhibition skills as time progressed (Park, Ellis Weismer, and Kaushanskaya 2018). As suggested by previous studies, DLLs are more likely to face environments where they need to deal with interfering responses from another language, thereby facilitating the growth of inhibition (Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019; Kuhn et al. 2016). According to Stocco et al. (2014), DLLs have superior capacities for inhibition because the top-down processing they use to process the first stimulus, which is mediated by the basal ganglia, tends to override their processing of the second stimulus. Therefore, DLLs are more likely to focus on the intended stimulus and ignore the second stimulus while performing inhibition tasks. A study by Bialystok and Craik (2022) also corroborated this finding, suggesting that a bilingual environment might lead to an adaptation of the attention system to cope with specialized demands. Bilingual individuals, immersed in an environment where they continually manage between two languages, are thus expected to increase the efficiency of utilizing their cognitive resources over time. This, in turn, is likely to foster the growth of executive function in DLLs (Bialystok and Craik 2022).

Findings of the present study were inconsistent with previous studies indicating that DLLs improved their executive function at a slower rate compared to English-speaking children (Wanless et al. 2011). One reason for the discrepancy between our results and other studies might be due to the different races or ethnicities of children included in other studies. In Wanless et al.’s study (2011), the participants were predominantly Spanish-speaking children, while the current research included children from a broader range of linguistic backgrounds. Research has shown that the language experience may influence cognitive demands, thus potentially affecting executive function (Bialystok and Craik 2022; Green and Abutalebi 2013). It remains unclear as to what specific aspects of dual language experience may have an impact on children’s executive function performance (Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019). The discrepancies among longitudinal studies may reflect the difference of bilingual experience on children’s executive function (Castillo et al. 2022). Accordingly, some bilingual experiences may influence specific executive function skills while others may not. Several studies have found that Spanish-English bilinguals learn Spanish more rapidly and exhibited smaller switching costs compared to Mandarin-English bilinguals (Cao et al. 2017; Prior and Gollan 2011). This contrast may stem from the inherent linguistic characteristics of Spanish and Mandarin in relation to English. The lexical similarity and alphabetic structure of Spanish with English could facilitate the mental transition between the languages, while Mandarin’s logographic system may demand more cognitive resources to navigate, leading to differences in executive function (Cao et al. 2017; Prior and Gollan 2011). This could possibly explain why different language exposures may lead to variations in executive function development. Another contributing factor could be the different measures used in the studies. Wanless et al. (2011) employed the Head-to-Toes Task for behavioral regulation, whereas the current study used Peg Tapping and DCCs to measure executive function. While some studies suggested bilinguals outperformed monolinguals in specific tasks (Bialystok and Craik 2022), the exact nature of how dual language experience impacts executive function in children remains unclear (Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019). Given that we had small sample size and limited number of children speaking the same language in the current study, we were not able to further investigate the possibility. Future research should focus on determining how these diverse experiences contribute to children’s executive function development.

We did not find any significant difference between monolingual English-speaking and DLLs on their initial level and growth rate of executive function as measured by the DCCS. Our findings differ from Castillo et al. (2022) which found bilingual children had a steeper growth on shifting over the end of kindergarten and through first grade. Yet, our results were consistent with studies reporting no differences between monolingual and DLLs on the developmental rate and initial level on shifting task (Park, Ellis Weismer, and Kaushanskaya 2018). The discrepancies among studies may be reflective of specific executive function skills that develop during different stages of life. It is suggested that the shifting skills required to sort things based on multiple rules, as needed in the DCCS tasks, tend to develop considerably later in life (Anderson and Reidy 2012). Although previous research indicated that DLLs were more skilled than monolingual children on DCCS (Bialystok 1999), the DCCS, which is believed to capture children’s shifting, may be relatively difficult for preschoolers and therefore not adequate enough to well detect the difference between monolingual English-speaking and DLLs in the study. Further investigation of how executive function develops across multiple tasks is necessary to fully understand what attributes affect children’s executive function development.

There were several strengths of our study, such as inclusion of DLLs and monolingual Englishspeaking children, it is a longitudinal study that includes four time points, and it focuses on early childhood period. One goal of the study was to investigate the trajectory of children’s executive function among monolingual English-speaking and DLLs in early childhood. While a previous longitudinal study was conducted with children of older age (Castillo et al. 2022), our study focused on preschool year, a time when children’s executive function skills are developing rapidly. As these skills become more important when children progress through elementary school or middle schools, the results of the study could help educators support children’s executive function in early period so that children can better adjust the classroom and learn more effectively. In addition, our study suggested that DLLs had a faster rate of growth on inhibition, as measured by the peg tapping task, compared to monolingual English-speaking children. This finding highlighted the potential cognitive advantages associated with bilingualism in early childhood, particularly in the domain of inhibition, as measured by the Peg Tapping tasks. Also, this demonstrated that exposure to more than one language in early childhood might enhance inhibition, which is regarded as an essential skill that helps children focus their attention in class and exert control over their thoughts and behaviors. It may also reflect the increased cognitive demands of managing multiple linguistic systems can potentially sharpen inhibition. Furthermore, according to the study, it is essential to note that not all children progress at the same pace. Individual differences in language background, socio-economic status and other factors like a child’s home environment and daily experiences can potentially impact children’s long-term performance (Hart and Risley 1995; Montroy et al. 2016). While schools generally offer structured environments supporting children’s executive function development, tailoring interventions to individual needs can be more effective in bridging the developmental gap. For instance, advanced programs can engage high-performing children, whereas specialized interventions might better support those exhibiting slower executive function growth. The findings of the study contribute valuable insights into the relationship between dual language experience and executive function development, particularly in the area of inhibition in early childhood.

# Limitations and future directions

There were several limitations of the current study. First, DLLs who participated in the study included children who spoke a variety of languages at home as their primary language. This might not fully capture the mechanism of how language affected children’s executive function development. Dual language effects on children’s executive function may vary across languages. It remained unclear as to what aspects of dual language experience and how exposure to different languages might have impacted children’s performance in executive function (Crespo, Gross, and Kaushanskaya 2019; Stocco et al. 2014). Also, it was possible that there were overlaps between bilingualism and cultural influences on the development of children’s executive function (Carlson and Meltzoff 2008; Castillo et al. 2022; Tran, Arredondo, and Yoshida 2015). Future studies are necessary to evaluate more specifically about how characteristics and use of different languages affect children’s executive function development (Montroy et al. 2016).

Second, the study only utilized two measures to understand children’s executive function development. While the Peg Tapping test was used to measure children’s inhibition, the DCCS was used to measure children’s attention shifting. These might not have fully captured the nature of executive function development as executive function is a multidimensional concept (Montroy et al. 2016; Park, Ellis Weismer, and Kaushanskaya 2018). Some researchers have suggested that using multiple executive function measures can help to investigate the specificity of bilingual children’s executive function (Carlson and Meltzoff 2008). Given that the current study used secondary data, we were unable to include more executive function measures in the study. Future studies that aim to understanding the development of children’s executive function should include multiple measures so that practitioners and policy-makers can identify what skills need to be targeted first in order to build more complex skills over time (Jones et al. 2016).

Finally, given the high percentage of missing data regarding children’s socioeconomic status as reported by parents/caregivers $( 1 7 . 2 \% )$ , the current study failed to control for children’s socioeconomic status while examining the trajectory of executive function development. However, researchers have pointed out that family socioeconomic status, such as parental education, occupation, and household income, have been linked to children’s cognitive development overtime (Blom et al. 2014; Montroy et al. 2016). Future work is needed to control for these variables so that the executive function trajectory across monolingual and dual language learning children could be accurately understood.
