# ABSTRACT

# KEYWORDS

Self-regulated learning has been frequently investigated and reported to be effective for second language education, so increasingly more researchers and educators have been interested in cultivating self-regulated second language learners. To assist researchers and educators, it appears beneficial to review previous studies concerning the strategies and teacher support conducive to self-regulated second language learning. Accordingly, we reviewed 58 relevant SSCI articles extracted from Web of Science databases. Findings revealed metacognitive strategies as the most frequently investigated strategy among the articles. Three main modes of teacher support were also uncovered: in-class instruction, guidance in authentic settings, and instruction-plus-guidance. The application of self-regulated language learning strategies was effective in academic (i.e. vocabulary, grammar, writing, reading, listening, speaking, and integrated language knowledge and skills) and affective (i.e. self-efficacy, motivation, and learning attitudes) domains. Specifically, metacognitive strategies could assist students in error identification, reduce procrastination, and strengthen their sense of control. Cognitive strategies could facilitate knowledge internalisation. Motivational strategies could increase learner efforts and persistence and improve their emotions. Behavioural strategies could encourage knowledge input and output and optimise the learning experience. To help students’ self-regulated second language learning, the reviewed articles recommended that teachers provide them with explicit strategy instruction, monitor and offer help in their learning progress, and give technological support. Based on the results, we identified the interactions among learners, strategies, learning tasks, and learning environment in self-regulated second language learning and provided implications for future investigations concerning the effectiveness of various strategies, the frequency of students’ use

of SRLL strategies in authentic settings, and the effects of self-regulated learning on various aspects of language development.

# 1.  Introduction

Self-regulated learning, which has been frequently investigated in second language (L2) education (Dent & Koenka, 2016; Lai & Gu, 2011), occurs when students develop, select, and use various strategies to plan, manage, and control their learning process with minimal reliance on teachers (see Benson, 2011; Broadbent & Poon, 2015). Most researchers regard self-regulated learning as an alternative to self-directed learning and independent learning, and some categorise it as one sub-category of autonomous learning (Reinders & White, 2016). The relationship between autonomous learning and self-regulated learning is that the former consists of four dimensions (i.e. location, formality, pedagogy, and locus of control), while the latter focuses on the last dimension with an emphasis on learners’ control of decision making (Benson, 2011). Previous research has identified the overall effectiveness of self-regulated L2 learning (hereinafter, SRLL) for improving learning attitudes (Ahn & Lee, 2016; Benson, 2011), enhancing motivation and self-efficacy (Chen et  al., 2019), and increasing L2 learning efficiency (Hu & Zhang, 2017). Equipped with SRLL abilities, students tended to perform L2 learning beyond classrooms and class hours and were likely to become active, lifelong learners (Bai & Wang, 2020; Nakata, 2010). Concurrent with academic research, increasingly more education practitioners have displayed an interest in SRLL by cultivating self-regulation in L2 learners (Lai & Gu, 2011; Wang & Chen, 2020). Since the outcomes of SRLL can be influenced by the exact strategies that learners use (Dent & Koenka, 2016) and the way teachers support learners (Han, 2014; Reinders & White, 2016), researchers and educators may need to attach particular significance to these two perspectives when designing and organising SRLL activities.

To assist researchers and educators, this study presents a review of articles on SRLL from 2010 to 2020, with foci on the types and benefits of strategies and the modes and implications for teacher support. By undertaking this review, we aim to attain a more in-depth understanding of how students and teachers engage in SRLL and how different factors may influence language learning. Four research questions guide this review:

1. What SRLL strategies were investigated in the studies?   
2. How did SRLL strategies benefit L2 learning?

3. How did teachers support students’ SRLL?   
4. What pedagogical implications for SRLL were suggested by the reviewed studies?

Following the lead of many review studies in the field of technology-assisted language learning (e.g. Su & Zou, 2020; Zou et  al., 2020), we reviewed the articles over a one-decade period (i.e. from 2010 to 2020). Self-regulated learning in L1 education, as opposed to the L2 variety, was not considered because of the differences in this learning method in various academic subjects (Dent & Koenka, 2016).

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  SRLL

Self-regulated learning broadly refers to an educational process in which learners proactively engage in academic tasks (Dembo et  al., 2006; Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 1986, 2000, 2002). As one dimension of autonomous learning (Oxford, 2008), self-regulated learning focuses on ‘locus of control’, emphasising learners making decisions about their own learning (Andrade & Bunker, 2009; Benson, 2011; Reinders & White, 2016). Pintrich (2000) provided a definition of this term that has been unanimously accepted in the field (Dent & Koenka, 2016): an ‘active, constructive process whereby students set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor, regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior, guided and constrained by their goals and the contextual features of their environment’ (p. 453).

Over the years, many theories have been proposed for analysing self-regulated learning from various perspectives (Dent & Koenka, 2016; Tseng et  al., 2006). Zimmerman’s Triadic model was a very influential one (Panadero, 2017). It contends that learners use strategies to control their learning behaviours and improve their learning environment; meanwhile, learners themselves may be affected by the environment and the strategies they take, experiencing covert self-regulation (Zimmerman, 1989). Another useful theory is Winne and Hadwin’s model (1998) (Panadero, 2017). In the model, learners use strategies to monitor, evaluate, and control their conditions in learning tasks (e.g. motivation, learning belief, domain knowledge) and the learning environment (e.g. social context, resources, time) based on the comparison against criteria and goals. Meanwhile, the task and environments affect learners from the aspects of cognitive processes and learning methods, leading to their strategy adjustment. Pintrich’s model (2000) was also frequently cited (Panadero, 2017) which describes how self-regulated learners deal with learning tasks using strategies. Learners manage their affect and effort in tasks using strategies that help improve their metacognitive processes. Metacognitive processes could further improve learners’ cognitive processes, indirectly improving learners’ efficiency in learning tasks. Boekaerts proposed the Dual Processing Model focusing on self-regulated learners’ experience of complex emotions in learning tasks and their use of strategies to deal with the emotions (Boekaerts & Cascallar, 2006). When students feel uncertain in themselves and resist learning, they may use strategies to address the negative feelings and protect their ego; on the other hand, they may feel interest in the tasks and domain knowledge and therefore use strategies to complete the tasks and amplify their competence.

Along with the expanding research on self-regulated learning, this learning approach has been increasingly applied to language development. Godwin-Jones (2011) conducted a review on technology-enhanced autonomous language learning and found that students could develop, change, and improve their autonomous language learning strategies with the aid of digital tools. Useful technologies included blogs, online editors, e-portfolios, e-logs, learning systems, personal learning spaces and online language labs or centres. Similarly, Warschauer and Liaw (2011) reviewed studies on technology-enhanced self-access and autonomous language learning, while identifying their overall effectiveness in enhancing L2 listening and speaking, collaborative writing, reading and language structure, and online interaction. They also identified the technologies used most frequently in this field, which included podcasts, blogs, wikis, online writing sites, text-scaffolding software, concordancers, multiuser virtual environments, multiplayer games and chatbots. In another study, Reinders and White (2016) reviewed the development of technology-enhanced autonomous language learning in the previous two decades. They summarised its main dimensions as learner training and strategies, teacher autonomy, self-access and language advising, telecollaboration, and social technologies for learning. Based on their review, they noted that technology-enhanced language learning and autonomous language learning were tending to merge together, making learning situations less formal and affording learners more control.

# 2.2.  Self-regulated learning strategies

Researchers have identified an abundance of language learning strategies and grouped them differently depending on the specific educational setting and purposes (Oxford, 1990, 2008, 2011). In SRLL, strategies can be placed into four categories following previous research in this field (e.g. Dent & Koenka, 2016): metacognitive, cognitive, behavioural and motivational. Appendix A presents a summary of the four categories of SRLL strategies and the main strategies.

Metacognitive strategies concern the high-order skills learners use to guide, regulate and control the entire learning process (Oxford, 2008; Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman & Moylan, 2009). Four metacognitive strategies have been investigated most frequently. The first is Self-monitoring, which refers to tracking and recording learning events and results (Garcia et  al., 2018; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986). The second is Planning, which concerns arranging the content, number, and sequence of learning tasks (Broadbent & Poon, 2015; Effeney et al., 2013). The third is Self-evaluation, which is associated with reflecting on the learning process, comparing learner performance with goals and assessing learning quality (Schunk, 2005; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986). The fourth is Goal Setting, which refers to setting goals and sub-goals of learning (Schunk, 2005; Zimmerman, 2000; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986).

Cognitive strategies encompass the skills to accomplish learning tasks using cognitive abilities (Oxford, 2008, 2017; Zimmerman, 2002). Five cognitive strategies are widely used. The first is Rehearsal, which refers to memorising learning materials through practice and repetition (Broadbent & Poon, 2015; Effeney et  al., 2013). The second is Record Reviewing, which concerns recalling learning tasks and rereading learning materials (Garcia et  al., 2018; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986). The third is Contribution Making, which is about making productive use of target knowledge and skills (Bai & Guo, 2018; Wang et  al., 2020). The fourth is Elaboration, which refers to making the newly learned knowledge more meaningful and comprehensible by integrating it into prior knowledge (Kizilcec et  al., 2017; Oxford, 2008; Weinstein et  al., 2011). The fifth is Visualisation, which is related to the organisation of learning materials by making charts, diagrams, or tables (Lin et  al., 2020; Morshedian et  al., 2017).

Motivational strategies refer to the skills to manage affective states in learning (Oxford, 2008, 2017; Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994, 2008). Three main strategies belong to this category. The first is Emotion Regulation, which is associated with addressing negative emotions, prompting motivation, enhancing learning awareness, and reducing stress during learning (Garcia et  al., 2018; Kinnunen & Simon, 2010). The second is Effort Regulation, which refers to improving and maintaining learning persistence when confronted with academic challenges (Kinnunen & Simon, 2010; Oxford, 2008). The third is Self-consequence, which is about expecting or arranging rewards or punishment depending on the academic performance (Garcia et  al., 2018; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986).

Behavioural strategies concern the skills to select or create a positive social and physical environment for learning (Panadero, 2017; Pintrich,

2000; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986). Five behavioural strategies are frequently applied. The first is Peer Learning, which refers to collaborating and communicating with other learners in academic projects (Broadbent & Poon, 2015; Effeney et  al., 2013). The second is Seeking Help, which is about soliciting instructional support from experts and other learners (Pintrich, 2000; Richardson et  al., 2012). The third is Handling Feedback, which is about responding to the instructional support offered by experts and other learners (Dembo et  al., 2006; Oxford, 2008). The fourth is Environmental Structuring, which concerns arranging positive physical settings for learning (Dembo et  al., 2006; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986), The fifth is Resource Management, which refers to seeking, identifying, and applying useful learning materials (Garcia et  al., 2018).

It is noteworthy that some researchers have categorised SRLL strategies differently, for example, dividing behavioural strategies into social-interactive strategies (Oxford, 2008, 2017) and environmental strategies (Zimmerman & Risemberg, 1997), or extracting emotional strategies from motivational strategies (Hadwin et  al., 2011; Panadero, 2017). Considering the diversified categorisations of SRLL strategies that have been adopted in the literature, we applied an inclusive, basic categorisation in the present review.

Discipline-specific reviews on SRLL strategies remained few. However, the effectiveness of self-regulated learning strategies for non-disciplinary education has been reviewed, some results of which may be generalisable in L2 learning while others may not. For example, in Broadbent and Poon’s meta-analysis of 12 studies on web-based self-regulated learning from 2004 to 2014 (2015), they identified Planning, Effort Regulation, Peer Learning, Elaboration, Rehearsal, and Seeking Help as the strategies investigated most frequently. They found fairly convincing evidence supporting the effectiveness of Planning and Effort Regulation for enhancing academic performance, whereas the evidence supporting the effectiveness of Rehearsal and Elaboration was insufficient. Dent and Koenka (2016) undertook meta-analyses of 61 studies on self-regulated learning in elementary and secondary education. The results showed no significant correlation between learners’ use of metacognitive and cognitive strategies and their academic achievements. Several factors were identified that may influence self-regulated learning outcomes, which included the self-regulated learning strategy students used, the academic subject being learned, and the student’s grade level.

# 2.3.  Teacher support in SRLL

Students engaged in SRLL rely minimally on teachers (Benson, 2011), but they are by no means isolated from teachers (Godwin-Jones, 2011).

Extensive research suggests that the significance of teacher support in SRLL is consistent with that in conventional language learning (Cohen & Macaro, 2007; García Botero et  al., 2019). However, it has been suggested that teachers’ duties and roles in SRLL might differ from those in the conventional, teacher-centred ones, indicating the necessity to re-conceptualise the role of the teacher (Reinders & White, 2016). Focusing on this topic, Han (2014) reviewed seven relevant studies and listed seven actions teachers could take to support students’ autonomous language learning: (1) teaching knowledge and strategies about language learning and autonomous learning; (2) providing students with encouragement and help; (3) designing and introducing activities where students can implement autonomous language learning; (4) communicating and collaborating with students like friends; (5) prompting students’ learning interest and motivation; (6) evaluating students’ performances and providing feedback and resources according to their performances; and (7) structuring a positive language learning environment.

Two modes of teacher support have frequently been applied in previous studies. One is SRLL instruction, which focuses on the systematic development and training of SRLL knowledge and strategies (e.g. Teng, 2020a, 2020b). Typical SRLL instruction consists of four steps: raising students’ consciousness of SRLL; presenting students with model applications of SRLL; guiding students’ practice of SRLL; and evaluation (Ardasheva et  al., 2017). This mode of teacher support has been effective in enhancing SRLL efficiency (Ardasheva, 2016; Ardasheva et  al., 2017). Ardasheva et  al. (2017), who conducted a meta-analysis study of 37 studies on teacher instruction for enhancing SRLL, identified its overall large, positive effects. The effectiveness of teacher instruction, however, may be moderated by the teaching contexts, teaching agents, and teaching methods. Perry et  al. (2007) described the characteristics of teacher instruction in classrooms that may promote students’ SRLL efficiency. These included complex, meaningful learning tasks, rich opportunities for practice, work emulation, modelling, and scaffolding from peers and teachers.

SRLL guidance was the other mode of teacher support frequently applied in previous studies. In this mode, teachers design and develop language learning environments, materials, and tools to trigger and guide students to apply SRLL strategies efficiently in authentic settings (e.g. Chen & Hsu, 2020; Kondo et  al., 2012). For example, teachers may: require students to use e-portfolios to lead them to conduct Goal Setting and Self-monitoring (Ziegler & Moeller, 2012); encourage students to participate in class blogs and class wikis to lead them to conduct Peer Learning, Seeking Help, and Handling Feedback (Lee, 2016); and attach browsing functionality to the learning system to lead students to conduct

Record Reviewing (Chen et  al., 2014), among others. Researchers identified the effectiveness of this mode of teacher support in promoting students’ spontaneous and efficient use of SRLL strategies and enhancing their language learning proficiency (Chen & Hsu, 2020; Lee, 2016). Along with the rapid development of technology-enhanced language learning, SRLL guidance may be increasingly accessible and effective with technological aid, affording learners with more convenience, support, and control in their SRLL in authentic settings (Reinders & White, 2016).

# 2.4.  Research gaps

Despite the many review studies and meta-analyses on SRLL described here, research gaps remain. First, to our knowledge, most reviews in the field of self-regulated learning have been non-disciplinary, e.g. Broadbent and Poon (2015) and Dent and Koenka (2016), while discipline-specific reviews of SRLL studies are few. Although the non-disciplinary reviews have increased the knowledge of self-regulated learning in general, some of their results may not be generalisable in the context of L2 education because the implementation and outcomes of self-regulated learning can vary according to the academic subject (Dent & Koenka, 2016). Thus, we contend that only when a discipline-specific review of SRLL studies is conducted can an accurate understanding of self-regulated learning in L2 education be attained.

Moreover, few reviews have focused on teacher support in SRLL, apart from Han (2014). However, teachers are important for developing SRLL in students (García Botero et  al., 2019; Hu & Zhang, 2017), and teachers’ roles and responsibilities therein are different from those in conventional, teacher-centred language learning (Han, 2014; Reinders & White, 2016). Hence, a better understanding of SRLL from the pedagogical perspective can add value to the field.

Finally, few SRLL studies published after 2016 have been covered in previous review studies. Considering the rapid development of technology-enhanced language learning (Shadiev & Yang, 2020; Zhang & Zou, 2020), the findings of previous reviews are becoming dated, calling for a timely review in this field.

# 3.  Methodology

This review was conducted using a three-step approach: search, selection, and data analysis, a basic and standard method used in review studies (e.g. in Fu et  al., 2022; Zou et  al., 2020). We searched for articles in the Web of Science Core Collection, using $^ { \cdot } 2 0 1 0 { - } 2 0 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ for the time span, ‘English’ as the language, and ‘article’ for the document type. The keywords used for the search included: (a) ‘self-regulated’, ‘self-regulation’, ‘self-regulatory’, ‘self-regulating’, ‘self-directed’, ‘self-access’, ‘autonomous’, ‘metacognitive strategies’, ‘cognitive strategies’, ‘behavioural strategies’, ‘behavioral strategies’ and ‘motivational strategies’, (b) ‘language learning’, ‘learn language’, ‘language teaching’, ‘teach language’, ‘language education’ and ‘language acquisition’, and (c) ‘ESL’, ‘EFL’, ‘English’, ‘second language’ and ‘foreign language’, with the AND operators between them. These keywords were adapted from Dent and Koenka (2016) keywords for searching articles on self-regulated learning. To search for the articles on L2 education, we included ‘ESL’ (i.e. ‘English as a second language’), ‘EFL’ (i.e. ‘English as a foreign language’), and ‘English’ in addition to ‘second language’ and ‘foreign language’ in group (c) and used the OR operator among these search terms, following Zhang and Zou (2021a, 2021b) and Zou et  al. (2021). Since English is frequently investigated as the target language in the field of L2 education, we included these terms related to English to increase the likelihood of including as many relevant articles in the search results as possible.

# 3.1.  Journal selection

For quality assurance, the search was conducted on articles indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), following many previous review studies (e.g. Chen et  al., 2021a, 2021b; Fu et  al., 2022). Initially, our review list included conference papers, book chapters, and non-SSCI journal articles; however, we identified some problems after reading a few. Some studies lacked important details such as descriptions and explanations of the exact SRLL strategies and target aspects of L2 learning. Other studies failed to explain their results convincingly and logically. For example, one conference paper reported a study about guiding students to implement SRLL to develop reading proficiency but did not specify what exact SRLL strategies students were guided to perform. Another non-SSCI journal article identified a positive correlation between the frequency of students’ applications of SRLL strategies and students’ performance in language tests but did not conduct an in-depth analysis of this correlation. Our review focused on SRLL strategies; therefore, the articles chosen for review had to provide specific descriptions of SRLL strategies and their effectiveness on specific aspects of L2 learning. They also had to present detailed explanations about the effectiveness with in-depth analyses.

# 3.2.  Article selection

The search was conducted on Jan 1st, 2021, generating 506 articles. The authors first reviewed the article titles and abstracts together, based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. First, the article had to focus on self-regulated learning. This criterion filtered out 235 articles. Second, the article had to focus on L2 education, which screened out another 86 articles. Third, the article had to be related to the effectiveness of SRLL for L2 education. This criterion screened out 51 articles. Fourth, the article could not be a review or a meta-analysis study. This criterion filtered out a further eight articles, e.g. Reinders and White (2016). Then, the authors read the full texts of the remaining 126 articles, based on two criteria. First, because self-regulated strategies are a critical feature of self-regulated learning (Dent & Koenka, 2016; Panadero, 2017), the article had to include explicit specifications of the self-regulated learning strategies that the language learners used. This criterion filtered out 46 articles. Second, the study subjects could not be students with special needs because the education for this type of student is considerably different from that of the general population of students (Scott & Windsor, 2000). This criterion screened out 22 another articles. Thus, the final selection ended with 58 articles (see Appendix B). Figure 1 illustrates the process and methods of data searching and selection, following Chen et  al. (2021b) and Fu et  al. (2022).

# 3.3.  Data analysis

To address the research questions, the 58 articles were coded based on four dimensions.

1. SRLL strategies The four categories of self-regulated learning strategies identified in the literature were generalised as four codes. The first code concerned metacognitive strategies, which included four sub-codes: Self-monitoring, Planning, Self-evaluation, and Goal Setting. The second code concerned cognitive strategies, encompassing five sub-codes: Rehearsal, Record Reviewing, Contribution Making, Elaboration, and Visualisation. The third code concerned motivational strategies, which included three sub-codes: Emotion Regulation, Effort Regulation, and Self-consequence. The final code concerned behavioural strategies, which encompassed five sub-codes: Peer Learning, Seeking Help, Environmental Structuring, Handling Feedback, and Resource Management.

Figure 1. P rocess and methods of data searching and selection.

2. Benefits of SRLL strategies This category was analysed based on three codes. One concerned the target aspects of L2 learning, encompassing academic aspects (e.g. listening, speaking, reading, writing, vocabulary, grammar, etc.) and affective aspects (e.g. self-efficacy, motivation, attitudes, interest, etc.). The second code concerned the results of the reviewed research on the effects of self-regulated learning on L2 learning, which fell into four sub-categories – positive, negative, neutral, and mixed. The third code concerned the researchers’ explanations about how different SRLL strategies contributed to the results.   
3. Modes of teacher support Two main modes of teacher support in SRLL identified in the literature were generalised as two codes – teacher instruction and teacher guidance.   
4. Pedagogical implications This category concerns the implications for teachers in supporting students’ SRLL.

We adopted a mixed coding method. We first conducted a careful review of representative studies in this field (e.g. Oxford, 2008, 2017; Schunk, 2005; Zimmerman, 2000, 2002; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986) and analysed five of the selected articles together to develop an initial coding scheme. Based on the scheme, we then deductively coded the remaining articles independently. During this coding process, we analysed the articles inductively. When we noticed new SRLL strategies beyond the scheme, we added them to the coding scheme, for example, Visualisation in Lin et  al. (2020). In this way, the final scheme included all main SRLL strategies investigated in the reviewed articles. So, the coding method of this research was a synthesis of deductive and inductive coding. The coding results were compared, reaching satisfactory inter-rater reliability (Pearson’s $r = 0 . 9 1 \AA$ ). The remaining differences between the independent coding results were resolved via discussion and consultation with a third researcher who was an expert in the field.

# 4.  Results

This section presents the results of article coding from four aspects: SRLL strategies, benefits of SRLL strategies, modes of teacher support in SRLL, and pedagogical implications. Appendix C shows the summary of the results.

# 4.1.  SRLL strategies

Figure 2 shows the frequency of self-regulated learning strategies investigated for L2 learning. The various colours represent different strategy categories, and the accompanying numbers represent the number of articles that investigated the specific strategies. For example, Rehearsal was a cognitive strategy investigated in 25 articles, visualised as an orange bar. The sum total is greater than 58 because most studies investigated more than one strategy.

The results reveal that among the 58 studies, many different self-regulated learning strategies were applied in L2 education. Students used metacognitive strategies to control their language learning process, especially Self-monitoring and Planning, which were investigated most frequently in the reviewed articles (e.g. in Cheng & Chau, 2013; Tao et  al., 2020). To complete specific language learning tasks, students used cognitive strategies (e.g. in Teng, 2020b; Teng & Zhang, 2016), among which Rehearsal and Record Reviewing were investigated most frequently. Motivational strategies, especially Emotion Regulation and Effort Regulation, were used and investigated for regulating L2 learners’ affective states (e.g. in Chen et  al., 2014; Kondo et  al., 2012). Language learning environment was enhanced through students’ use of behavioural strategies (e.g. Wang & Zhan, 2020; Zheng et  al., 2018), among which Peer Learning and Seeking Help were investigated most frequently. In sum, the reviewed studies investigated different SRLL strategies with varying frequencies, with metacognitive strategies investigated most frequently.

SRLL was effective from diverse academic aspects, although no large differences in effects were found among these aspects. As shown in Figure 3, 15 studies investigated SRLL for enhancing writing proficiency, among which 12 reported positive results and three reported mixed (both positive and neutral) results; 13 studies investigated integrated language knowledge and skills, among which 11 reported positive results, one (Yang & Plakans, 2012) reported neutral results, and one (Bai &

Wang, 2020) reported mixed (both positive and neutral) results; 11 studies investigated reading proficiency, among which 10 reported positive results and one (García Botero et  al., 2019) reported neutral results; eight studies investigated vocabulary knowledge, among which seven reported positive results and one (Wang et  al., 2020) reported mixed (positive and neutral) results; five studies investigated listening proficiency, among which four reported positive results and one (García Botero et  al., 2019) reported neutral results; five studies investigated speaking proficiency, among which four reported positive results and one (Csizér & Tankó, 2017) reported neutral results; three studies investigated grammar knowledge, two of which reported positive results and one (Taslibeyaz, 2018) reported neutral results. Many studies investigated more than one aspect.

The results showed that strategies in different categories can contribute to the development of L2 knowledge and skills in different ways. Metacognitive strategies may help students identify errors and complete learning tasks on time (Chen et  al., 2020; Kim, 2014). When using metacognitive strategies, learners tended to examine the learning tasks at hand, reflect on their academic performance, and judge the effectiveness of the learning methods they used, so they were likely to identify their mistakes and improper use of learning methods and correct them (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Kim, 2014). Moreover, it was observed by Chen et  al. (2020) and Shadiev et  al. (2018) that metacognitive strategies enabled learners to have better control over their learning pace, so they were less likely to procrastinate. For example, Hromalik and Koszalka (2018) required students to develop speaking proficiency through SRLL and identified a positive correlation between learners’ use of metacognitive strategies and their learning outcomes. The researchers found that the students who often employed metacognitive strategies, especially Self-monitoring, could recognise more learning mistakes and adjust their learning methods more frequently. Also, the students who often used metacognitive strategies tended to complete learning tasks earlier than those who did not, leading to their higher learning efficiency. Similarly, Shadiev et  al. (2018) developed a mobile-based multimedia learning system that led students to use metacognitive strategies, such as Planning and Self-monitoring, to develop vocabulary and grammar knowledge. Their post-test results revealed that the students who used this system outperformed those who did not because they were more likely to actively complete learning tasks in time and have higher learning efficiency.

Cognitive strategies may help students internalise instructional materials (Teng & Zhang, 2016, 2018). As explained by Saks and Leijen (2018) and Teng and Zhang (2016), learners’ use of cognitive strategies resulted in increased engagement in the comprehension and memorisation of learning materials leading to their enhanced learning efficiency and longer retention of L2 knowledge and skills. For example, Ariel and Karpicke (2018) required their participants to learn new words through Rehearsal, Elaboration, and Record Reviewing while having the autonomy to control the amount, method, and time of the learning tasks. The results showed that the participants achieved significant enhancement in vocabulary knowledge because their cognitive strategies helped them memorise the target words efficiently with long retention. Teng and Zhang (2016) analysed L2 students’ writing scores and their questionnaire feedback; they noted a significantly positive correlation between students’ writing proficiency and their use of cognitive strategies, specifically, Rehearsal and Contribution Making. They explained that students tended to memorise linguistic knowledge better and improve their writing skills when they employed cognitive strategies more frequently.

Motivational strategies may trigger and maintain students’ effort to learn (Tan et  al., 2019; Teng et  al., 2020). Through motivational strategies, learners reduced their negative emotions, perceived their progress in learning, and obtained increased confidence and motivation (Teng et  al., 2020; Teng & Zhang, 2016), making them more willing to devote effort to learning activities over time. Empirical evidence was found in Tan et  al. (2019), who proposed a mobile SRLL system for developing listening proficiency. Their experimental group of participants used the system with an extra reward mechanism that encouraged Emotion Regulation and Self-consequence, while the control group used the system without a reward mechanism. The results showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group in a post-test because their engagement and motivation in learning, practicing, and challenge-mounting were significantly higher. Also, by identifying a positive correlation between students’ academic performance and the use of motivational strategies, Teng et  al. (2020) argued that motivational strategies may help students develop a sense of achievement in learning, enhance their persistence and passion for writing, and thereby contribute to better learning outcomes.

Behavioural strategies may increase students’ access to instructional support and opportunities for productive use of L2 (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Hu & Zhang, 2017). By using this category of strategies, learners may optimise their language learning environments and thereby more easily access learning materials and output-based learning activities (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Saks & Leije, 2018) and feel comfortable and connected with other learners (Hu & Zhang, 2017). Positive learning environments, therefore, usually resulted in learners’ increased opportunities and willingness to receive input and produce output (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Hu & Zhang 2017). Hu and Zhang (2017), for example, organised an activity in which students were guided to develop their academic reading proficiency through SRLL. Students used online communication tools to perform a series of behavioural strategies in group projects, such as Peer Learning, Seeking Help, and Environment Structuring. The researchers found that these strategies allowed students to study in a comfortable environment in which they fostered a sense of membership and projected a willingness to listen to other group members’ opinions and make contributions to their group projects. The results also showed that the participants significantly improved their reading proficiency through SRLL. Hromalik and Koszalka (2018) reported the positive effects of using behavioural strategies on language learning. They found that students who frequently applied behavioural strategies, especially Resource Management, tended to achieve satisfying learning outcomes because online learning resources provided abundant useful learning materials, comprehensible input, and language production activities.

# 4.2.2.  Benefits of SRLL strategies on affective states

SRLL had overall positive effects on L2 learners’ affective states. Figure  4 shows that 15 studies investigated self-efficacy, nine investigated learning attitudes, and seven investigated motivation. All the studies on SRLL for enhancing affective states reported positive results, other than Khodarahmi and Zarrinabadi (2016) who reported neutral results in their investigation of learning attitudes, and Wang et  al. (2020), who reported neutral results in their investigation of motivation.

Figure 4. E ffects of SR LL on various affective aspects of L2 learning.

Focusing on affective states in learning, motivational strategies had significant positive effects on L2 learners’ self-efficacy, learning attitudes, and motivation (Liu et  al., 2014; Wang et  al., 2020). For example, Wang et  al. (2020) organised a two-week activity where the students received vocabulary instructions in class and were guided to conduct SRLL out-ofclass using communication tools. During their SRLL, the students created vocabulary-related illustrations, shared them in group chats, and exchanged comments and encouragement for Effort Regulation and Emotion Regulation. The results showed that students’ use of these strategies had largely enhanced their motivation and learning attitudes, making them more willing to continue learning this way. Bai et  al. (2020b) investigated L2 learners’ use of motivational strategies and their affective conditions in L2 writing, and also identified a significant positive correlation between them.

Metacognitive strategies may also be conducive to positive affective states in L2 learning by strengthening learners’ sense of control over learning (Bai & Guo, 2018; Su et  al., 2018). Bai and Guo (2018) and Su et  al. (2018) argued that when using metacognitive strategies, students tended to focus on their learning goals, foresee their entire learning process, and mentally note the specific steps in the process, thereby likely obtaining an increased sense of control over learning. This increased sense of control helped learners gain confidence and positive emotions towards learning (Bai & Guo, 2018; Su et  al., 2018). Empirical evidence was provided by Su et  al. (2019), who found that by employing metacognitive strategies, especially Goal Setting, the students could keep ‘a specific and achievable learning goal in mind’ (p. 576) and hold an increased sense of control over their learning process. Therefore, those students were more committed to learning activities and obtained higher self-efficacy and motivation.

Behavioural strategies may benefit L2 learners’ affective states by improving their learning experience (Hu & Zhang, 2017; Su et  al., 2018). Using behavioural strategies, learners may create positive learning environments where they feel confident, happy, and relaxed, as reported by

Hu and Zhang (2017) and Su et  al. (2018). For example, Su et  al. (2019) reported that students in their study tended to positively perceive their engagement and progress when learning in proactively selected environments. These positive perceptions fostered learners’ self-efficacy and motivation (Su et  al., 2019). Shadiev et  al. (2018) also found that behavioural strategies, especially Peer Learning, helped learners perceive learning to be enjoyable and less stressful, thereby leading to better affective states.

In sum, the reviewed articles investigated SRLL from both language knowledge aspects (i.e. vocabulary, grammar, writing, reading, listening, speaking, and integrated language knowledge and skills) and affective aspects (i.e. self-efficacy, motivation, and learning attitudes), yielding overall positive effects from SRLL strategies. Metacognitive strategies helped students identify their errors in learning and complete learning tasks on time while enhancing their sense of control over learning. Cognitive strategies helped students internalise L2 knowledge and skills. Motivational strategies enabled students to put more effort and persistence into learning and experience better emotions in general. Behavioural strategies encouraged students to receive input and produce output and improved their learning experience physically and emotionally. In this way, our review revealed that SRLL strategies of various categories may benefit L2 learning in different ways.

It is noteworthy that SRLL could benefit students regardless of their ages and educational levels. The results showed that primary (Bai & Wang, 2020; Chen et  al., 2019), secondary (Ahn & Lee, 2016; Chen et  al., 2014), and university students (Altıok et  al., 2019; Kim, 2014) could all achieve enhanced academic performance and affective states in SRLL. Nevertheless, learner personality, as a possible mediating factor of the effectiveness of SRLL, has rarely been discussed, so future studies may consider exploring this direction.

# 4.3.  Modes of teacher support in SRLL

Diversified modes of teacher support were applied in SRLL, as illustrated in Figure 5. SRLL supported by teacher guidance alone was investigated most frequently (in 21 studies, $3 6 \%$ ), while teacher instruction alone (in eight studies, $1 4 \%$ ) was second most frequent. Five studies $( 9 \% )$ investigated SRLL that was supported by both teacher guidance and instruction. Twenty-four studies $( 4 1 \% )$ did not specify teacher support.

Teachers supported students’ SRLL by guiding their selection and application of SRLL strategies in authentic settings (Liu et  al., 2014; Su et  al., 2019). The guidance was usually presented via mobile devices, such as Nintendo DS (Kondo et  al., 2012) and tablet PCs (Lin et  al.,

![](img/1a62fd1758833cd77abd85cb69d9fc1a55affb70c523594745c3bf123223d240.jpg)  
Figure 5. M odes of teacher support in students’ SR LL.

2020), or Internet-based systems, such as e-portfolio (Ziegler & Moeller, 2012), teacher-developed e-learning platforms (Lee, 2016) and wikis (Lee, 2016). Altıok et  al. (2019) described a study in which the teachers guided their students’ seven-week SRLL with the aid of Kinect technology and an e-portfolio. In the study, students participated in game-based learning activities in classrooms during which their performances were recorded and transferred into an e-portfolio by Kinect technology. Out of class, the students were guided to conduct SRLL by reviewing the course material, evaluating the in-class performances of themselves and other learners, and proposing methods for further improvement in their e-portfolios. Teachers commented on students’ performance and provided suggestions during their implementation of SRLL. The results showed that the guided SRLL resulted in higher SRLL capabilities and enhanced L2 proficiency. Another example was provided by Lee (2016), who guided students to engage in a four-week SRLL project with a series of e-learning tools. The students were led to conduct input-based rehearsals in an e-learning centre, participate in Peer Learning in a class blog and manage learning resources in a class wiki. Speech recording and recognition technology was also provided to the students, encouraging them to make spoken contributions and review oral records at their own pace. The results showed the SRLL guidance resulted in significant development of L2 knowledge and skills.

Teacher instructions can help students develop knowledge and strategies of SRLL systematically leading to students’ spontaneous, efficient implementation of this learning approach (Morshedian et  al., 2017; Teng, 2020a, 2020b). Multimedia-enhanced booklets (Ferreira et  al., 2017) and lectures (Tavakoli & Koosha, 2016) were used to present the instructions. Tavakoli and Koosha (2016) presented an example of how they supported students’ SRLL through instruction. They designed a 12-week language course integrated with SRLL instruction, in which the students learned integrated language knowledge and skills; the students were also taught the significance of SRLL while learning SRLL knowledge and strategies, and practicing SRLL in specific language learning tasks. The results showed that the instruction significantly improved students’ ability and usage of SRLL and enhanced their L2 learning outcomes.

Teacher instruction and teacher guidance were sometimes provided together, helping students’ development and application of SRLL knowledge and skills at the same time (e.g. García Botero et  al. 2019; Hu & Zhang, 2017; Lan et  al., 2020). In García Botero et  al. (2019), teachers provided SRLL strategies and knowledge and guided students to develop language skills through this approach with the aid of the mobile language learning application, Duolingo. During their implementation of SRLL, teachers kept monitoring students’ learning progress and provided help whenever needed. The results showed that the SRLL supported by instruction-plus-guidance had significant, positive effects on enhancing students’ L2 writing proficiency.

# 4.3.1.  Conditions of unsuccessful conduction of SRLL

Although most SRLL activities reported in the literature were successful, researchers noted conditions that might result in unsuccessful cases. Bai and Guo (2018), Bai and Wang (2020), Hu and Zhang (2017), Su et  al. (2018), and Sun and Wang (2020) reported that some students relied on teachers too heavily to conduct SRLL effectively. Bai and Wang (2020) found that some of their participants simply relied on their teachers to provide them with learning materials and point out their goals and errors in learning. Those students attached little importance to SRLL and had little desire to take responsibility for their learning even when the learning environment was designed to trigger SRLL. Su et  al. (2018) observed a similar condition, finding that the students who demonstrated a heavy reliance on their teachers tended to avoid using SRLL strategies, especially Self-evaluation. This problem might be related to cultural environments and educational contexts. Researchers observed that in East Asia, teachers tended to have strong control over the content, pace, methods, and behaviours of learning, requiring their students to follow them closely (Bai & Wang, 2020; Sun & Wang, 2020). In a teacher-centred learning environment as such, students were more likely to rely on their teachers (Su et  al., 2018) and undervalue SRLL (Hu & Zhang, 2017). Therefore, students’ shallow awareness of the importance of SRLL may impede their uptake of this learning approach.

In the same vein, Bai et  al. (2020b), Hromalik and Koszalka (2018) and Liu et  al. (2014) reported that students could not conduct SRLL well when they had low-quality peer-to-peer interactivity. SRLL usually involved peer-to-peer interactivity, especially when learners used behavioural strategies like Seeking Help, Peer Learning, and Handling

Feedback (e.g. in Kim, 2014; Teng & Zhang, 2020). However, some students resisted peer-to-peer interactivity using SRLL (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Liu et  al., 2014) because they felt isolated from others and uncomfortable communicating and collaborating in a SRLL environment (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018). Liu et  al. (2014) also argued that Asian students were overall reluctant to engage in peer-to-peer interactivities in SRLL. This might be associated to the cultural backgrounds, which may to some extent influence students’ willingness of communication and collaboration. Additionally, Bai et  al. (2020b) found that even when learners were willing to participate in peer-to-peer activities using SRLL, they may have insufficient communication and collaboration skills for understanding each other or offering constructive feedback, especially for young primary school students. Thus, students’ lack of willingness and skills to communicate and collaborate with peers likely led to unsuccessful SRLL.

In sum, our review reveals various modes of teacher support in students’ SRLL. Teachers guided students’ selection and application of SRLL strategies in authentic learning with the aid of digital tools and online platforms. They also provided students with systematic instructions in SRLL, facilitating their development of related knowledge and strategies. Teachers offered students both guidance and instruction, helping them develop SRLL competence and conducted their teaching in authentic settings with high efficiency. Despite different modes of teacher support, however, the implementation of SRLL was not always successful, especially when students relied heavily on their teachers due to their low awareness of the efficacy of SRLL and when they had low-quality peer-to-peer interactivity due to their lack of willingness and communication skills.

# 4.4.  Pedagogical implications for SRLL

Our review identified a consensus among researchers that teacher support is very helpful in students’ SRLL (e.g. García Botero et  al., 2019; Kim, 2014; Morshedian et  al., 2017). To support SRLL, three main pedagogical implications were suggested in the literature.

First, teachers should provide students with SRLL instruction and guide them to practice different SRLL strategies (Ariel & Karpicke, 2018; García Botero et  al., 2019) so that they can develop their SRLL skills based on their needs and preferences. Researchers observed that students demonstrated an overall low frequency of using SRLL strategies in authentic settings (Bai & Wang, 2020; Csizér & Tankó, 2017; Sun & Wang, 2020). This is perhaps because most learners had insufficient awareness, knowledge, and skills of SRLL (Hu & Zhang, 2017);

some students attached little importance to SRLL (Kondo et  al., 2012); some students had no idea how to effectively select and use SRLL strategies (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018); and others lacked opportunities to practice SRLL (Bai & Wang, 2020; Csizér & Tankó, 2017). Thus, SRLL instruction may be beneficial, which in turn enhances learners’ awareness of the importance of SRLL (Csizér & Tankó, 2017), shows them the characteristics and usefulness of different SRLL strategies (Su et  al., 2019), demonstrates the application of these strategies with examples (Bai & Wang, 2020) and helps students apply SRLL to specific learning tasks (Morshedian et  al., 2017). Blending the SRLL instruction into regular language courses was widely recommended (e.g. in Teng, 2020b; Teng & Zhang, 2020) and frequently applied (e.g. in Graham et  al., 2020; Tavakoli & Koosha, 2016). For example, Teng (2020b) designed an L2 reading course into which instruction on metacognitive strategies was weaved. The teacher informed students of the usefulness, characteristics, and application of various metacognitive strategies and encouraged them to apply them in specific reading tasks. The results showed that the SRLL instruction weaved into the reading course significantly improved learners’ reading proficiency and ability to conduct SRLL.

Second, our review revealed teachers should monitor students’ SRLL progress and help when necessary (Ferreira et  al., 2017; Kim et  al., 2015). Students often encountered difficulties and frustrations during SRLL because they lacked practical experience (Liu et  al., 2014). To address this problem, teachers were recommended to keep monitoring students’ SRLL processes and periodically check their understanding of SRLL strategies (Tavakoli & Koosha, 2016), so they could identify students’ mistakes and needs, provide instructional and emotional support and help them adjust and improve over time (Liu et  al., 2014). Bai and Wang (2020) described an example: when students applied Self-monitoring, teachers can remind them to use Record Reviewing to review their performance in learning tasks and use Self-evaluation to compare their performance against their goals; if students’ current state of learning failed to reach their goals, teachers might encourage them to try Rehearsal, Seeking Help, or Environment Structuring.

Third, teachers should give students technological support (Lin et  al., 2020; Naseri & Motallebzadeh, 2016). Technology has been closely integrated into the implementation of SRLL (Yang, 2016), positively influencing its effectiveness (Chen & Hsu, 2020). Thus, teachers should provide their students with useful and usable technologies (Naseri & Motallebzadeh, 2016; Su et  al., 2019). For example, Naseri and Motallebzadeh (2016) suggested teachers equip classrooms with computers, Internet support, and smartboards to provide students with rich, up-to-date authentic materials in SRLL instruction. Su et  al. (2019) emphasised the need for online collaborative learning systems that support Peer Learning, Seeking Help, and Handling Feedback in SRLL. Portable keyboards should also be offered for SRLL to give students high mobility in learning and produce learning output ‘ubiquitously and authentically’ (Lin et  al., 2020, p. 23).

In sum, our review identifies the important role played by teachers in support of SRLL as reported in the literature. Teachers were recommended to help their students by providing SRLL instruction, monitoring students’ SRLL processes and giving proper scaffolding and offering useful and usable technologies for SRLL.

# 5.  Discussion

Based on our analysis of the review results, in this section we identify the interactions among learners, strategies, learning tasks, and learning environment in SRLL. We also suggest some implications for future studies.

# 5.1.  Interactions in SRLL

Effective SRLL appears to require interactions among learners, strategies, learning tasks, and the learning environment. In the process, learners take control of the selection and usage of SRLL strategies in L2 development, and these strategies may then influence learning tasks, the learning environment, and the learners themselves. Learners are also under the influence of the learning environment.

As for influencing learners, motivational strategies were effective for improving learners’ self-efficacy, motivation, and learning attitudes in L2 learning (Liu et  al., 2014; Wang et  al., 2020). Metacognitive strategies also positively influenced L2 learners’ affective states by boosting their confidence and sense of control over their learning (Bai & Guo, 2018; Su et  al., 2018). As for influencing tasks, learner efficiency and performance in specific L2 learning tasks were improved by cognitive strategies that facilitated the comprehension and memorisation of learning materials (Teng & Zhang, 2016, 2018). Further, metacognitive strategies expedited mistake identification (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Kim, 2014) and minimised procrastination (Chen et  al., 2020; Shadiev et  al., 2018). As for influencing the learning environment, behavioural strategies appear to have increased students’ opportunities for knowledge input and output (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Hu & Zhang, 2017) and enhanced their enjoyment and sense of connection with peers in L2 learning (Hu & Zhang, 2017; Su et  al., 2018).

The learning environment seemed to have influenced learners’ SRLL in two ways. One concerned teacher support (Bai & Wang, 2020; Tavakoli & Koosha, 2016). Appropriate teacher support can improve students’ awareness, knowledge, and experiences of SRLL (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Teng, 2020b), and thereby enable them to perform SRLL spontaneously, efficiently, skilfully, and comfortably (Brydges et  al., 2015; Csizér & Tankó, 2017; Ferreira et  al., 2017; Su et  al., 2019). Despite the significance of teacher support in SRLL, however, teachers should avoid being at the centre of learning; otherwise, students may remain unaware of the efficacy of SRLL and become detached from their learning responsibilities (Hu & Zhang, 2017; Su et  al., 2018).

Furthermore, the learning environment may influence learners’ SRLL from the aspect of peer-to-peer interactivity. When peer-to-peer interactivity in SRLL was of high quality and large quantity, learners were likely to have rich opportunities for knowledge input and output (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018) and a strong sense of enjoyment and comfort (Shadiev et  al., 2018), which can improve L2 knowledge (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018) and affective states (Hu & Zhang, 2017). If students lack motivation or skills in peer-to-peer interactivity, however, the outcomes of SRLL may be unsatisfying (Bai et  al., 2020b; Liu et  al., 2014).

These interactions in SRLL align with previous theories on self-regulated learning from three main perspectives. First, we found that learners’ use of strategies could improve their affective states, consistent with Pintrich’s model (2000) and the Dual Processing Model. These strategies can also enhance learners’ conditions in tasks and the external environment, theoretically in line with Zimmerman’s Triadic model and Winne and Hadwin’s model (1998). Second, the learning environment can positively influence learners’ emotions, cognitive processes, and learning behaviours in SRLL, echoing the Triadic model and Winne and Hadwin’s model. Third, various strategy categories may contribute to the improvement of SRLL from different aspects, which was also suggested by the Dual Processing Model and Pintrich’s (2000) model. Therefore, practitioners are recommended to select and use proper strategies to address specific needs in different aspects of SRLL, such as cognitive strategies to positively influence learning tasks, motivational strategies to benefit learners and behavioural strategies to enhance the learning environment.

In addition to similarities with existing research, there were two main new findings that may contribute to the complexity of SRLL. First, many previous studies have contended that metacognitive strategies have indirect (Pintrich, 2000; Winne & Hadwin, 1998), or even insignificant effects (Dent & Koenka, 2016) on specific tasks; however, this review identified empirical evidence supporting the direct, positive effects of this strategy category on L2 learning tasks (Chen et  al., 2020; Kim, 2014). Metacognitive strategies were used to facilitate mistake identification and reduce procrastination (Chen et  al., 2020; Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018); they were also helpful in enhancing learner efficiency and performance for general progress and in specific tasks. Due to these benefits, it appears appropriate for educators to guide their students to use metacognitive strategies in SRLL, especially when students encounter difficulties in identifying their errors and completing tasks on time (Shadiev et  al., 2018; Su et  al., 2019).

Second, although few studies have discussed the influence of teacher support and peer-to-peer interactivity on SRLL, our review revealed the considerable impact of the learning environment based on the quantity and quality of teacher support (Liu et  al., 2014) and peer-to-peer interactivity (Bai et  al., 2020b). Due to the importance of teacher support, teachers may facilitate students’ development and application of SRLL by presenting instruction (García Botero et  al., 2019), giving proper guidance (Kondo et  al., 2012), scaffolding (Ferreira et  al., 2017) and providing technical support (Naseri & Motallebzadeh, 2016) while offering support only when necessary or requested (Lan et  al., 2020). To improve the quality and quantity of peer-to-peer interactivity in SRLL, students may need explicit training on communication and collaboration (Hromalik & Koszalka, 2018; Stavredes & Herder, 2014). They may also require comfortable places for learning (Su et  al., 2019), collaborative learning tools such as class wikis and class blogs (Lee, 2016) and collaborative learning tasks (Hu & Zhang, 2017; Wang & Zhan, 2020). Communication tools and platforms, such as WeChat (Wang et  al., 2020) and Edmodo (Lam et  al., 2018), may also be helpful in affording students a relaxing and convenient environment for peer-to-peer interactivity (Godwin-Jones, 2011; Zhang & Zou, 2020).

In sum, our review reveals that L2 learners may use various strategies to influence different aspects of SRLL, and learners themselves may be affected by the strategies and the environment, which echoes existing research. Two notable points emerging from our review are the direct positive effects of metacognitive strategies on specific tasks and the influence that the quantity and quality of teacher support and peer-topeer interactivity have on SRLL.

# 5.2.  Future studies

This review identified the grand trends in the reviewed articles concerning the overall effectiveness of self-regulated learning approach for L2 learning, which agrees with most reviews in this field (e.g. Godwin-Jones, 2011; Warschauer & Liaw, 2011). Despite the grand trends, however, we identified some conflicting results in the literature regarding the exact effects of specific SRLL strategies. For example, researchers have found that Goal Setting and Planning were conducive to L2 development (e.g. Chen et  al., 2020; Shadiev et  al., 2018), while others noted the insignificant correlation between the use of these two strategies and L2 learning (e.g. Bai & Wang, 2020). Similarly, researchers have identified the positive influence of Seeking Help and Peer Learning on improving L2 development and affective states (e.g. Hu & Zhang, 2017), while others have reported only neutral effects of these two strategies (e.g. Teng & Zhang, 2018).

Conflicting results were also identified in the literature concerning the frequency of students’ use of SRLL strategies in authentic settings. Some researchers reported an overall low frequency of all strategies in real-life L2 learning (Bai & Wang, 2020; Csizér & Tankó, 2017; Sun & Wang, 2020), while some observed a medium frequency (Bai et  al., 2020, 2020b; Lin et  al., 2017). Concerning the use of different types of SRLL strategies, Bai et  al. (2020a) and Zheng et  al. (2018) reported a higher frequency for the use of Planning than others in L2 classrooms, while Bai and Wang (2020) and Sun and Wang (2020) observed the opposite. Similarly, Sun and Wang (2020) found a very high frequency for the use of Effort Regulation, while Csizér and Tankó (2017) revealed the opposite.

Additionally, our review identified target elements of SRLL that have seldom been investigated in previous reviews (i.e. vocabulary, grammar, writing, reading, listening, speaking, integrated language knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, motivation, and learning attitudes) and the inclusive results concerning the effectiveness of self-regulated learning approach for these elements. For example, researchers have claimed the usefulness of SRLL for developing speaking proficiency (e.g. Kim, 2014; Oddsdóttir et  al., 2020), while others reported no significant usefulness for this element (e.g. Csizér & Tankó, 2017). Moreover, researchers have observed their students’ enhanced listening (e.g. Tan et  al., 2019; Yang, 2016) and reading proficiency (e.g. Kondo et  al., 2012; Morshedian et  al., 2017) after SRLL treatment, while others have not (e.g. García Botero et  al., 2019).

In sum, although self-regulated learning approach in general was conducive to L2 education in general, conflicting results exist regarding the exact effectiveness of specific strategies, the frequency of students’ use of SRLL strategies in authentic settings, and the effectiveness of SRLL on specific target elements. Results such as these may lead to practitioners’ and researchers’ confusion and hesitation in selecting and using strategies in L2 learning with different target elements, so we call for more research in this area to clear up the uncertainty.

# 6.  Conclusions and limitations

This study presents a review of SRLL studies published from 2010 to 2020 indicating the overall effectiveness of SRLL for L2 development. The review reveals that all four categories of self-regulated learning strategies were useful for L2 education (i.e. metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioural), with metacognitive strategies being investigated most frequently. SRLL had overall positive effects on L2 development and affective aspects, while various strategies benefitted L2 learning in different ways. The review showed that teachers could support SRLL by providing instruction and/or guidance. Summarizing the implications, there were three main points for practitioners of SRLL to consider. They are the need to (1) provide SRLL instruction; (2) monitor and scaffold students’ SRLL processes; and (3) offer technical support.

Based on the analysis of the review results, we identified interactions among learners, strategies, learning tasks, and the learning environment as the grand trends in SRLL studies. Practitioner are recommended to cultivate self-regulated L2 learners, encourage the application of strategies in various categories to improve L2 learning from different aspects, and enhance the quality and quantity of teacher support and peer-to-peer interactivity in SRLL. Inclusive results in the literature were also identified, concerning the exact effectiveness of various strategies, the frequency of students’ use of SRLL strategies in authentic settings, and the effects of SRLL on various target elements, which may be promising directions for future investigation in this area.

Our study is not without its limitations. First, the reviewed articles included only publications in SSCI journals, so the presented picture of the field of SRLL may be incomplete. Future research may analyse a more extensive database, including book chapters, conference papers, and journal articles indexed by AHCI, Scopus, and ERIC, to explore this field more comprehensively. Second, to ensure the relevance of the reviewed articles to SRLL, this review focused only on articles that explicitly mentioned self-regulated learning strategies. However, some interpretative studies on self-regulated learning theory may have been excluded. Future studies may investigate studies on SRLL beyond the realm of strategies to obtain a more comprehensive picture of this field. Third, this study involved no meta-analysis because we focused on the reasons previous researchers gave for their findings/statistics, rather than the findings/statistics themselves. Because most of the reviewed articles reported positive results and investigated more than one type/category of SRLL strategy, we found it difficult to identify the effects of different types/categories of SRLL strategies on L2 learning. Future studies may review articles on SRLL by calculating an effect size for each study, conducting a statistical meta-analysis and investigating the comparative effects of different SRLL strategies. Fourth, this study investigated SRLL with a focus on strategies. Future studies can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of this learning approach by investigating other elements and interactions. For example, various types of technology and digital tools have been applied in SRLL, such as Kinect technology (Altıok et  al., 2019), multimedia technology (Graham et  al., 2020) e-portfolios (Ziegler & Moeller, 2012) and Nintendo DS (Kondo et  al., 2012), all of which are reportedly useful in expediting teacher support, facilitating students’ implementation of strategies and enhancing language learning efficiency (Altıok et  al., 2019; Ziegler & Moeller, 2012). Therefore, investigating the types and impact of various technologies in SRLL shows promise for future study. Additionally, our review revealed that peer-to-peer interactivity in SRLL is complex and dynamic (Lam et  al., 2018; Teng & Zhang, 2018), with considerable impact on learner motivation (Bai & Wang, 2020) and learning efficiency (Yang, 2016). Hence, future studies may focus on interactive patterns in SRLL.

Finally, this review has demonstrated that SRLL activities effectively enhance language learning outcomes and develop independent and self-motivated learners despite a few challenges. Hence, we call for more contributions to this field, such as the differences between SRLL in different contexts.
