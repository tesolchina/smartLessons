# ABSTRACT

Many bilingual infants attend early childhood education centres (ECEC) with their monolingual peers. However, recent evidence reveals that bilingual infants vocalise significantly less than monolingual infants in ECEC settings (Zheng et al. 2023) [Effects of Multilingualism on Australian Infants’ Language Environments in Early Childhood Education Centers. Infant Behavior and Development, 70, 101799.], suggesting that educators may need to provide language tailored strategies to support bilingual infants’ language learning. This study examines how educators support Mandarin-English bilingual infants’ learning and development through a range of translanguaging practices in Australian ECEC contexts. We identified three functions of fluid translanguaging pedagogies: (1) make meaning and acknowledge children’s bilingual repertoires during play-based interactions; (2) introduce the connections between two languages during literacy and play activities; (3) provide emotional support or regulate behaviour through the use of home language. We also identified educators’ language-supporting strategies such as repetition, expanding their own/child’s utterances, labelling and questioning during translanguaging practices. This study is the first to closely describe the dynamic nature of translanguaging interactions between early childhood educators and Mandarin-English bilingual children under the age of two. Findings highlight the importance of translanguaging for scaffolding infants’ bilingual language learning, fostering their bilingual identities and supporting their wellbeing.

# Introduction

# Importance of supporting bilingual development in ECEC

Many young children grow up to hear and learn more than one language. These bilingual children spend a significant amount of time in early childhood education centres (ECEC) in the first few years of their life. Evidence suggests that bilingual children, particularly infants, may need additional support from educators to facilitate their language learning compared with their monolingual peers (Langeloo et al. 2019; Zheng, Degotardi, and Djonov 2021; Zheng et al. 2023). Such support may reduce inequity in the learning opportunities, and the associated risk of underachievement in academic and other skills. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how educators support bilingual infants’ language learning through everyday interactions in ECEC settings. In addition, early childhood educators’ language practices with bilingual children are still underexplored, particularly for children under the age of two. This study aims to understand how Australian educators use translanguaging to scaffold Mandarin-English bilingual infants’ learning. In this study, the term ‘infants’ refers to children from birth to 24 months of age.

# Mandarin-English bilingual infants in Australian EC centres

Australia is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse countries in the world. National census data show that 5.8 million people $( 2 2 . 8 \% )$ reported speaking a language other than English at home, and Mandarin recorded the highest number of speakers (685,274) (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2021). Chinese people also constitute Australia’s second largest migrant population group. Therefore, many Australian Mandarin-English bilingual infants attend early childhood education centres.

The Early Years Learning Framework for Australia (AGDE V2.0 2022) emphasises the importance of using children’s home languages to construct meaning and develop strong connections with their families. The Framework also encourages educators to model appreciation of linguistic diversity and expose children to different languages and dialects. Research reveals, however, that many educators struggle to provide adequate support to facilitate early bilingualism at ECEC settings (Verdon, McLeod, and Winsler 2014; Zheng et al. 2023). For instance, a recent large-scale study of Australian bilingual infants’ ECEC language environments found no difference in the quantity of educators’ language input that monolingual and bilingual infants experienced, while bilingual infants produced significantly less vocalisations than their monolingual peers (Zheng et al. 2023). These findings suggest that educators and policy makers may need to develop language-specific strategies to support bilingual infants’ learning. Given the important role of Chinese communities in Australian society and the great number of Australian Mandarin speakers, this study examines how educators support Mandarin-English bilingual infants’ learning through translanguaging pedagogies that incorporate a range of language-supporting strategies in ECEC settings.

# Supporting language learning in ECEC settings

Research shows that educators employ various pedagogies to promote young children’s language learning through conversations as well as play-based activities (Burke Hadley et al. 2022; Degotardi 2021; Dickinson and Porche 2011). For instance, Girolametto and Weitzman (2002) found that both toddlers and preschoolers benefited from educators’ child-centred approach and interaction-promoting strategies, which included following children’s interests, extending conversations by asking questions, and encouraging turn-taking. Their study also suggested that educators adapted their pedagogies based on children’s age and level of language development, for instance, using more labelling with toddlers and focusing more on topic extension with older children (Girolametto and Weitzman 2002).

While a large body of prior studies has demonstrated the positive impact of educators’ language practices on preschool-aged children, fewer have explored the strategies educators use to support infants and toddlers. A recent review of research on the language environments in ECEC settings identified infant educators’ language supporting practices (Degotardi 2021). These include: adopting a child-oriented approach, initiating and sustaining conversations about the objects and experiences that infants show an interest in (Cain, Rudd, and Saxon 2007); using interaction-promoting strategies such as asking confirm (yes/no) and specify (what, where, when, who, and which) questions to create spaces for infants to contribute to conversations (Davis and Torr 2016; Degotardi, Torr, and Han 2018); and language-modelling strategies such as exposing infants to a diverse vocabulary and functions of language use in different activity contexts (e.g. book reading, snack time) (Degotardi, Torr, and Nguyen 2016). As most previous research has focused on monolingual infants in ECEC settings, the review reveals a gap in existing knowledge about educators’ practices with bilingual children under two (Degotardi 2021). To address this gap, the present study explores educators’ interactions with bilingual infants in ECEC settings with the aim of identifying their strategies for enhancing children’s learning opportunities.

# Translanguaging practices

In the last few decades, as the need to support bilingual learners has been increasingly recognised, bilingual pedagogies have become an important direction in education research. An essential aspect of bilingual pedagogies in classrooms is translanguaging (García 2009; García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017; Li 2014; 2018). From a social-interactionist perspective, Otheguy, García, and Reid (2015) define ‘translanguaging’ as a practice that emphasises a speaker’s full linguistic repertoire regardless of the social and political boundaries of languages and dialects. Particularly, translanguaging focuses on how multilingual speakers’ linguistic practices construct and employ a complete language repertoire, and facilitate the learning of two or more languages without separating them (García and Li 2014; Lewis, Jones, and Baker 2012). Furthermore, translanguaging involves the use of linguistic and semiotic resources that leverage a person’s full capacity for meaning-making and learning (García and Otheguy 2020).

In classrooms, translanguaging offers benefits such as promoting language learning, academic performance, well-being and inclusion (García and Sylvan 2011; Lewis, Jones, and Baker 2012; Mary and Young 2017). In school contexts, García, Johnson, and Seltzer (2017) identified four functions of translanguaging practices: (i) enabling bilingual learners to engage with and understand complex content and texts; (ii) creating opportunities for young learners to develop linguistic knowledge in academic contexts; (iii) leveraging bilingual language skills and ways of knowing simultaneously; and (iv) fostering bilingual identities. Similarly, Li (2018) recognised the capacity of translanguaging to transform the power relations between learners and educators and to enhance, through its emphasis on meaning-making, learners’ experiences and ability to develop bilingual identities. The benefits of translanguaging pedagogies thus extend beyond supporting language learning and knowledge construction (Li 2018).

Pedagogical translanguaging refers to educators’ teaching strategies that incorporate learners’ full linguistic repertoires into classroom activities and curriculum design, with the goal of creating equitable learning spaces (Kirsch and Mortini 2023; Li 2018). Through translanguaging pedagogies, educators utilise children’s multiple languages, and multimodal resources such as speech, gestures, body movements, and other visual cues to scaffold language learning, facilitate knowledge construction, and enhance classroom participation (Li 2011; 2018; Tai 2023a; 2023b). Particularly, according to García, Johnson, and Seltzer (2017), translanguaging pedagogies involve three interrelated elements: stance, design, and shifts. A translanguaging stance refers to commitment to recognizing and respecting bilingual students’ semiotic repertoires and use their languages as resources. Adopting this stance allows educators to design curricula and learning activities that activate bilingual students’ full linguistic repertoires in ways that could promote learning of both the majority and their home languages. Translanguaging shifts enable educators to adapt their teaching practices to support children’s needs (Aleksić and García 2022; Kirsch 2020). These elements of translanguaging pedagogies were evident in the infant-educator interactions in this study. Educators respected infants’ bilingual repertoire by employing both English and Mandarin (translanguaging stance), initiated and engaged in sustained interactions with these infants across various activities (translanguaging designs). In addition, educators adapted their use of linguistic and other meaningmaking resources to the infants’ learning interests and needs (translanguaging shifts).

# Translanguaging in ECEC settings

In ECEC settings, infants and toddlers learn language through play-based activities and high-quality interactions with educators (Degotardi 2021). Translanguaging pedagogies align well with efforts in early childhood education to provide play-based and equal learning opportunities that build on all children’s experiences and knowledge (Kultti 2022). Translanguaging pedagogies enable children to employ spoken words, vocalisations, gestures, gaze, body movements and other resources to communicate. In this way, children are able to share their knowledge, communicate, and learn about themselves, others and the world around them, and thereby further develop their language and meaning-making skills (Aleksić and García 2022; Garrity, Aquino-Sterling, and Day 2015). Translanguaging pedagogies are therefore particularly valuable for supporting bilingual infants, who rely significantly on pre-verbal communication.

Recognising the need for children from multilingual backgrounds to be supported in ECEC settings, Kultti (2022) proposed a theorical model for global early childhood education (GECE) that encourages: (i) embedding children’s home languages, perspectives and personal experiences in playful activities; and (ii) employing translation and talking about languages during daily routines. This proposal finds support in empirical studies of various activities in American and European multilingual preschool contexts (Kirsch 2020; 2021; Sembiante et al. 2023; Pontier, Destro Boruchowski, and Olivo 2020; Zheng, Degotardi, and Djonov 2021). For example, during the show-and-tell activities in Spanish-English bilingual preschool classrooms, translanguaging enabled educators to model use of Spanish by expanding children’s utterances, and to develop children’s metalinguistic awareness and language comprehension by using questions and prompts in both Spanish and English (Sembiante et al. 2023). In a study in Luxembourg, educators scaffolded preschool children’s vocabulary learning in both Luxembourgish and French during retelling story and interactive book reading time (Kirsch 2020). Looking beyond language and literacy activities, a systematic review of 29 studies on dynamic language practices in multilingual ECEC settings suggested that translanguaging occurred also in activities such as socio-dramatic play, unstructured free play and daily routines (Pontier, Destro Boruchowski, and Olivo 2020). These prior studies demonstrate one of the most unique and significant features of translanguaging in ECEC contexts: bilingual young children develop language skills and construct their knowledge through participating in a range of playful and literacy activities.

In addition to promoting language development, translanguaging serves several other important functions in ECEC contexts. One is facilitating learning by creating a ‘translanguaging space’ (Li 2011), that is, a social space where bilingual children, as ‘natural translanguagers’, can bring their languages, cultures, home experiences and prior knowledge in classroom interactions with their peers and educators (Aleksić and García 2022). Translanguaging can also foster respect for different languages in the classroom and empower children to develop their bilingual identities (Kultti 2022b; Li 2018). In ECEC settings, translanguaging also helps educators provide emotional support or manage behaviour (Langeloo et al. 2019). For example, a systematic review of 31 studies of multilingual teacher–child interactions in preschool settings revealed that the teachers used children’s home languages and non-verbal communication not only for instructional but also for emotional support and managing classroom behaviour (Langeloo et al. 2019).

While translanguaging pedagogies in school and preschool settings have received much more attention, there is a dearth of research into their use and potential to provide learning opportunities for bilingual infants. The only one example is Garrity et al.’s (2015) phenomenological exploration of educators’ perspectives of using translanguaging in infant rooms (6–15 months). Through interviews with the educators and the educators’ observational notes, Garrity, Aquino-Sterling, and Day (2015) concluded that translanguaging offers a useful lens for understanding the fluidity of bilingual infanteducator interactions. Garrity, Aquino-Sterling, and Day (2015), however, did not directly observe and analyse actual translanguaging practices.

Inspired by the power of translanguaging practices to support bilingual development across educational contexts (García and Li 2014), this study seeks to extend our currently very limited knowledge about translanguaging in infant-educator interactions in ECEC settings. To achieve this, adopting a social-interactionist perspective, our study closely examines Mandarin-English infanteducator interactions and addresses two research questions:

(1) How do translanguaging practices support bilingual infants’ learning in ECEC settings? (2) What language-supporting strategies do educators use when engaging in translanguaging practices with infants?

# Method

# Data collection

The data presented in this article are drawn from a larger, five-year, longitudinal study of the impact of infants’ ECEC language environments on their language outcome in the preschool years. This project received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the authors’ university. Early childhood centres from a database created for organising professional experience placements and from a network of centres previously engaged in early childhood research were invited via email to participate. All participating centres catered for children aged from six weeks to five years. The educators extended an invitation to the parents of all infants who met the following selection criteria: (1) be between 12 and 24 months old; (2) attend the centre for at least two days each week; (3) be physically and emotionally settled in the centre; (4) have no existing language or developmental challenges. We received written parent/guardian consent of 189 infants (from 12 to 21 months of age) from 37 ECEC centres in Sydney, Australia. The participated infants came from a wide range of socio-economic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Written consent was also obtained from all educators in each centre’s infant room and the parents/guardians of other infants who attended on the dates of data collection. The names of all children, educators and early childhood centres were replaced by pseudonyms.

After obtaining consent, the second author and research assistants visited the centres to videorecord each infant’s participation in naturally-occurring infant-educator interactions, collecting approximately one to one and half hour of video per infant between August 2018 and May 2021. During the visit, research assistants also collected centre field notes, recording information about the educators’ qualifications (university-qualified early childhood teacher (ECT), diploma/certificate-qualified educator), maximum group size, number of educators, and details about language use on the day of recording at the centre.

For the present study, the first author watched all 189 videos to identify case studies that contained infant-educator conversations in both English and Mandarin in each episode. An episode concluded when the topic of the interaction or the activity in which it occurred changed, or when the child or educator left the interaction. Four Mandarin-English bilingual infant-educator dyads from four different centres met this criterion. Our analysis draws on the field notes and six hours of video-recorded interactions between these focal infants with their educators. These interactions occurred in one-to-one situations (e.g. individual support such as soothing a crying infant, nappy changes etc), and also when more children were present (e.g. shared book reading in a small group). For the present study, we examined interactions between the educators and focal infants in both types of situations.

# Settings

Each of the four centres in this study had an infant program catering for 12 children. Centre A and Centre B were located on the authors’ university campus and serves University staff, students and the local community, with university staff and students enjoying priority at Centre B. During the centre visit, the infant room in Centre A had two university-qualified ECTs, two diploma-qualified and one certificate-qualified educator, and in Centre B there were one ECT, one diploma-qualified and two certificate-qualified educators. Centre C was located in an inner-city suburb of XXX. During the centre visit, there were two diploma-qualified and two certificate-qualified educators in the infant room. Centre D was located 15 kilometres north-west of XXX. There were one ECT, two diplomaqualified and two certificate-qualified educators in the infant room during the centre visit.

Note: The majority of infants in the study were from high socio-economic status, as the mean gross household income in Australia from 2019 to 2020 was $\$ 121$ ,108 (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2021).

# Participants

Demographic data about the educators and the focal infants were collected through centre field notes and parent questionnaires (Tables 1 and 2). Educators’ work experiences in ECEC ranged from 3 to 11 years. Although the primary language used in these EC centres was Standard Australian English, all educators came from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds and were able to speak both English and Mandarin to the children. The parent questionnaire collected information about the infant’s age, gender, annual household income, maternal education, other languages spoken at home, and days of attendance in the centres etc. The four infants were from 13 to 19 months old. According to the centre field notes and the parent questionnaires, each infant was spoken to in both Mandarin and English at the centre as well as at home.

# Data analysis

In the present study, we analysed all interactions during which the focal infants and educators engaged in translanguaging. These interactions occurred in various activities, ranging from shared book reading, singing, drawing, teacher-led play activities involving play-dough, sandpits and blocks and infant-led free play. Transcription of these interactions was completed in two stages.

The first author transcribed educators’ and children’s linguistic utterances first – in Mandarin and in English. She then added descriptions of gesture and other non-verbal resources involved in each interaction.

Data were examined using thematic analysis in order to identify and define the themes that addressed the research questions, and summarise the common patterns related to the meaning of the data set (Braun and Clarke 2006). To analyse the conversations between educators and infants, we employed a social-cultural approach to describe the turn-taking and the dynamics of the interactions (Kirsch and Mortini 2023). Specifically, we sought to understand the context in which translanguaging practices occurred, the pedagogic functions they served, and the language-supporting strategies that teachers employed. The coding process was both inductive and deductive. In addressing the first research question, which focuses on the nature and functions of translanguaging practices, the first and second author met to discuss the contexts and the functions of educators’ translanguaging practices after reviewing the transcripts of the interactions from the excerpts with reference to Kultti (2022), Langeloo et al. (2019), and Li (2018). Table 3 shows the coding categories and examples of translanguaging practices during the interactions.

To address the second research question, we developed categories for coding different types of language-supporting strategies adapted from previous early childhood research on educator-child interactions (Degotardi 2021; Girolametto and Weitzman 2002; Dickinson and Porche 2011; Zucker et al. 2010). These are presented in Table 4.

# Findings

In this section, we present our findings using ‘representative excerpts’ to illustrate consistent patterns in the nature and functions of infant-educator translanguaging interactions (Tai 2023b). We chose two to three excerpts for each of the three types of translanguaging practices. Each type is described in terms of the activity context, its pedagogical function/s, and the language-supporting strategies.

# Translanguaging for meaning making during play-based interactions

The first type of translanguaging practices is using both Mandarin and English to draw on their semiotic repertoires in flexible ways in child-initiated interactions. Educators’ use of translanguaging provided infants with opportunities to develop their understanding of semantics and language awareness in play-based environments (Kultti 2022b). The educators’ responses to the infants were contingent, grounded in the present moment, and the infants’ interests. These strategies are particularly supportive for language learning in infancy (Rowe and Snow 2020).

An example of translanguaging for making meaning is provided in Excerpt 1 below. Ms Amy from centre A noticed that the focal infant Jean was looking at the photos of children and their families displayed on the classroom wall. Ms Amy sustained a conversation with Jean in Mandarin.

In the following excerpts, the translation into English is provided in square brackets, and the description of gesture and other non-verbal interactions is provided in round brackets.

# Excerpt 1: Conversation about photos in the wall

Jean: Hi. (Greets Ms Amy.)   
Ms Amy: (Notices child looking at the photos in the wall.)   
阿姑在哪里？阿姑跟姐姐呢？[Where is Mommy? Where is Mommy and (your) older sister?] Jean: (Points to the picture)   
姐姐 [Older sister].   
Ms Amy: 姐姐[Older sister]. Jessica and Jimmy (note: Jean’s two older siblings’ names). Where is Tia? Jean: 在 [in] here. Ya … (Points at the other picture.)   
Ms Amy: Yanny here. Here. Where is Cathy, Jean?   
(Jean points at the girl in the other photo.)   
Ms Amy: Oh Cathy. You found her, did you? Who is this?   
Jean: Mommy.   
Ms Amy: Mommy. Mommy.   
(Jean points at the girl in the other photo.)   
Jean: Tina.   
Ms Amy: Tina. Luna. Luna.   
Jean: Luna.   
Ms Amy: Luna is not here today.   
Jean: 爸爸 [daddy] (Points at her father in the photo.)   
Ms Amy: 这个是谁 [Who is this?] Who is this? 妹妹 [Younger sister].   
Jean: 妹妹 [Younger sister].   
Ms Amy: You and妹妹 [younger sister].

In this child-oriented conversation that acknowledged Jean’s semiotic repertoire and valued her home language, Ms Amy used Mandarin to ask Jean to identify her friends and family members in the photos on the wall. After Jean provided her answer ‘姐姐[older sister]’, Ms Amy responded to Jean by repeating Jean’s utterance. Ms Amy then used English to ask Jean to find her friends in the photos. Jean firstly responded in Mandarin, then she immediately used English to answer the question. The conversation continued through fluid translanguaging between Ms Amy and Jean. When Jean found her father in the photo wall, she combined Mandarin with a pointing gesture to inform the educator that her father was in the picture. Ms Amy responded contingently in Mandarin by asking who another family member in the photo was. After that Ms Amy repeated the same question in English. Waiting for a few seconds without a response from Jean, Ms Amy quickly provided the answer: ‘妹妹[younger sister]’ in Mandarin. Jean and repeated the answer from Ms Amy. To confirm Jean’s answer, Ms Amy further expanded Jean’s utterances, and combined both languages in concluding the conversation. Through this process, Jean used both Mandarin and English to communicate with Ms Amy, engage into the conversation about her family members and friends, and thereby further develop her semiotic repertoire.

The following example shows Ms Bec from centre B employing translanguaging in a conversation about the birds the focal infant Ivy noticed in the outdoor play area.

# Excerpt 2: Conversation about a bird

Ms Bec: (Ivy walks towards Ms Bec.) 你要干嘛？[what would you like to do?] 你要干嘛？ [what would you like to do?]   
Ivy: (Ivy responds to Ms Bec with a smile and goes to hug her, Ivy then looks at the birds in the sky for a while.)   
Ms Bec: Ah. Bird. That’s the bird. Where is the bird? 那是小鸟. 小鸟叫. [That is the bird. The bird is making sounds]. 小鸟 在叫, 小鸟在叫. [the bird is making sounds. The bird is making sounds.] (Ivy still looks in the direction of the birds.)

In this interaction, Ms Bec noticed that Ivy slowly approached her and wanted some attention. Ms Bec asked ‘what would you like to do’ in Mandarin to initiate their conversation, repeating her question twice as part of her interaction-promoting/language modelling strategies. Ivy responded to Ms Bec with a smile and a hug to sustain the interaction. Following Ivy’s lead, as Ivy’s attention turned to the birds in the sky, Ms Bec switched to English and provided the answer by expanding on her own utterances ‘bird, that is the bird’. Ms Bec continued to ask an open question about the location of the birds in English, and then used Mandarin to provide the answers. She also repeated and expanded her own answers by adding the Mandarin aspect particle ‘在’, which is used to express an ongoing/in progress action (similar to present continuous tense in English). By using open questioning, repeating and modelling the use of this aspect particle, Ms Bec provided Ivy with an opportunity to learn the word ‘bird’ and language to describe the actions of birds in both English and Mandarin.

In both examples, the focal children were able to participate in knowledge construction and understand the objects around their daily environment during free play.

# Introducing the connections between two languages during literacy and play activities

Educators also employed translation in translanguaging during literacy and play activities. Translating between different languages reflects educators’ efforts to consider bilingual children’s perspectives and adapt their communication strategies to promote comprehension in both languages (Kultti 2022a). Cross-linguistic transfer and translation are essential teaching tools for developing bilingual children’s language awareness (Cummins 2007; De Houwer 2021). Through translation, bilingual children can compare and understand the connections between different languages.

In Excerpt 3, Ms Chloe from centre C started the book reading in English, and then translated key lexical items from the picture book in Mandarin.

# Excerpt 3: Book reading

Ms Chloe:

Ms Chloe:

(Cara and Ms Chloe sit on the mat.)   
Let’s turn the page and have a look. I saw a green duck quack quack   
What did you see? What is that? Moo moo cow. Quack quack duck. Neigh neigh horse. Woof woof dog.   
(Cara looks at the page the educator is pointing at and reading. The educator then turns to the next page.)   
(Points to the picture of a dog and a cat.)   
小狗[little dog]. 猫[cat].   
(Cara keeps looking at the pictures of the animals on the book. Ms Chloe points the items on the same page and continually labels them.)   
牛[cow]. 猪[pig]. 小鸭子 [little ducky]. 小狗 [little dog].小猪猪 [little pig pig]. 小狗狗 [little dog dog]. Woof woof. 小狗 [little dog].小鸭子[little ducky]. 小猪 [little pig]. 牛[cow]. 马 [horse]. 小猫[little cat]. 小狗 [little dog].小鸭子 [little ducky].   
(Cara points at the pictures on the page to respond to Ms Chloe’s labelling.)

Ms Chloe:

At first, Ms Chloe used open questions to ask Cara to name the animals in the picture book. Following that, using English, she provided the names of the animals and imitated the sounds the animals make to prompt Cara’s response. Cara responded to Ms Chloe by pointing to these animals on the page. After Ms Chloe assured Cara’s attention is on the book, Ms Chloe translated the names of the animals into Mandarin. Ms Chloe also started expanding these one-syllable words into noun phrases (adjective $^ +$ noun) by adding the diminutive adjective ‘little’, by using reduplicative words of Mandarin (狗狗 [dog dog],猪猪 [pig pig]), which is equivalent to doggy, piggy (in English), or by using the diminutive suffix ‘子’ to indicate ‘smallness’. Diminutives are common in child-directed speech in Mandarin and other Chinese dialects. As Ms Chloe connected the names of the animals in English and Mandarin through translation and Cara contingently responded through gestures, Ms Chloe successfully sustained Cara’s attention on the picture book and scaffolded both English and Mandarin learning (with child-oriented and interactionpromoting strategies).

Another example of translation we observed took place during a block play session presented in Excerpt 4. Ms Bec from centre B saw Ivy pulling apart the blocks. Ms Bec encouraged Ivy to put the blocks back together.

# Excerpt 4: Playing with blocks

Ms Bec: (Ivy and another child are playing with Mega Blocks. Ms Bec and another educator are sitting next to the two children. Ivy takes apart two pieces of mega blocks.) 你把它拆开了吗？[did you take them apart?] 拆开了. [Took apart already.] 把他放回去. [put them together.] 放回去. 放回去. [Put them together. Put them together.]   
Ivy: (Ivy smiles at Ms Bec) (Ivy looks at the two blocks, then she takes another one from the box.)   
Ms Bec: I put them together. You took them apart. Put them together. (Ms Bec shows Ivy how to put the blocks together, and Ivy watches Ms Bec carefully.)

Ms Bec initiated the conversation in Mandarin, asked a closed question to seek confirmation from Ivy about whether she had taken apart the blocks. Then she labelled Ivy’s action: ‘Took apart already’. When asking Ivy to put the blocks back together, Ms Bec repeated key words several times ‘放回去[put them together]’. Repetition has been demonstrated to significantly predict infants’ vocabulary learning (Rowe and Snow 2020). As Ivy did not follow her instruction, Ms Bec decided to show Ivy how to put the blocks together and translated key words in English. Ms Bec also repeated the key words to encourage Ivy to participate in putting the blocks together, and further labelled her own actions of manipulating the blocks. In this excerpt, Ms Bec employed interactive strategies such as asking a closed question and using repetition to facilitate translation.

The following example shows that Ms Amy from centre A used translation to boost Jean’s vocalisation during a pretend play episode.

# Excerpt 5: Pretend-play phone call

Ms Amy: (Jean puts a toy phone near her ear.) Who are you calling? (Jean does not respond.)   
Ms Amy: 你要给谁打电话？ [who are you calling?] Hello.   
Jean: (Holds the phone and babbles.) Hello. Bye bye.   
Ms Amy: Bye bye.

When Jean did not respond to her initial question, Ms Amy encouraged her vocalisation by translating her question in Mandarin. When Jean then responded in English, Ms Amy repeated Jean’s utterance, thus providing Jean with the opportunity to understand the initial message as well as the connections between English and Mandarin.

# Providing emotional support or regulating behaviour

Consistent with previous studies (Langeloo et al. 2019), we too observed educators using Mandarin to provide emotional support or regulate their behaviour. This mostly occurred during transition time or daily routines. The following example illustrates the power of the home language for Cara from Centre C.

Excerpt 6: Soothing a crying infant.

Ms Grace (a monolingual (Cara is crying.) educator): (Cuddles Cara, but Cara does not stop crying.) Are you ok? What’s wrong? See, she is there. (Points to Ms Chloe for Cara.) (Ms Grace gives Cara to Ms Chloe.)   
Ms Chloe: 曲曲 [Child name].曲曲不哭 [No crying.] 不哭不哭[No crying no crying.] Come on. It’s ok. We just changed nappy. Fine.不哭 [No crying]. What’s wrong? Let’s come and sing. (Cara stops crying.)

At the beginning, an English monolingual educator tried to soothe Cara as she was crying. However, Cara continued to cry until she saw Ms Chloe coming. Ms Chloe used Mandarin to calm Cara, and explained to her what to do next (singing songs after nappy change). Cara stopped crying immediately after Ms Chloe repeated the comforting words in Mandarin.

In another example, from centre D, Ms Dane checked Leo’s head after he accidently fell.

Excerpt 7: Comforting a child after an accident.

Ms Dane: (Leo falls down due to tripping over a toy dinosaur.) Are you ok? Are you ok? Can I check on you? 没事吗？痛痛吗？痛痛吗？[Are you ok? Does it hurt? Does it hurt?]   
Ms Dane: Can I see? Ah. Ah. (Ms Dane looks at his face closely, and asks Leo to open his mouth so that she can look more closely.) 没事啦. [You are ok.] Leo stands there and looks at Ms Dane while she checks his face. Soon Leo notices the toys on the floor and walks towards them.

To show her concern, Ms Dane used both English and Mandarin to ask how Leo felt after the accident. She first repeated the question in both languages, along with using the common features of child-directed speech: reduplicated adjectives (痛痛 [painful]) in Mandarin to make Leo feel secure. Using Leo’s home language, Ms Dane was able to show her care for Leo and create a safe teacher– child relationship.

In the following example, Ms Dane switched to Mandarin to explain the nappy change routine to Leo:

Excerpt 8: Explaining a transition.

Ms Dane:

(Leo plays with toy cars.)   
We go nappy change.走啦走啦. [Let’s go. Let’s go.] 换裤换裤. [Change pants, change pants]. You can bring the car. Let’s go change the nappy.

In this example, Leo was concentrating on his playing with cars, when Ms Dane came and used first English, then Mandarin to help Leo understand the routine of nappy change. This appeared to help prevent Leo from getting upset about the disruption of his play time as he was aware of what would happen next.

# Discussion

This is the first study to closely examine the dynamics of translanguaging in Mandarin-English bilingual infant-educator naturalistic interactions. Our study identified three types of translanguaging practices in infant rooms that vary in their use of resources, activity contexts, the functions and the language-promoting strategies. These types are: translanguaging for meaning making during play-based interactions; connecting two languages during literacy and play activities; and using the home language to provide emotional support or regulate behaviour. Educators in our study flexibly used these approaches in conversations, a range of playful activities, literacy activities and transition time.

Translanguaging creates opportunities for focal infants to participate and learn through sustained, back-and-forth bilingual interactions with their educators in play-based environments and draw on children’s lead and interests, which aligns with the notion of ‘translanguaging space’ and ‘global early childhood education (GECE)’ in ECEC contexts (Kultti 2022a; Li 2011). In addition, we also identified a range of language supporting strategies that scaffold bilingual young children’s language learning during translanguaging practices. Unlike preschool teachers who employed topic extension, sophisticated vocabulary and inferencing (Dickinson and Porche 2011; Burke Hadley et al. 2022), the four educators in our study frequently used repetition, labelling, and confirm and specify questions with infants. This finding is consistent with prior studies on educators’ language practices with monolingual infants, which have shown that educators’ language supporting strategies is responsive to the child’s age and language capabilities (Degotardi, Torr, and Han 2018; Girolametto and Weitzman 2002).

Regarding the functions of tranlanguaging, our study found that educators used translanguaging during play-based interactions to acknowledge infants’ bilingual meaning-making repertoires and support the learning of new objects from the surrounding environment, and thereby develop infants’ bilingual identities. In this context, the educators tended to sustain the interactions by drawing on the child’s interests (translanguaging stances, trasnlanguaging designs and translanguaging shifts) (García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017). Particularly, the educators used utterances in both Mandarin and English, children’s photos, birds, gestures (pointing), gaze and body language (hug, smile) to provide learning opportunities for the focal infants. In these practices, translanguaging and multimodal resources were used to co-construct meaning (talking about family members in the photo walls and birds in the sky) during free play. It also included interactive strategies to engage the child as a conversational participant, and maximise the learning opportunities by using questioning and confirmation of the infant’s response.

The educators also used translanguaging to support the infants’ learning the connections between the two languages during literacy and teacher-led play activities. The use of translation is also emphasised by the framework of ‘global early childhood education (GECE)’ (Kultti 2022a), which benefits bilingual children through connecting both languages and modelling the correct use of each language in different activity contexts. The predominance of labeling and repetition associated with translation suggests that the educators focused on helping focal children understand linguistic features of both languages to promote their bilingual vocabulary learning. When translanguaging practices can be used to support meaningmaking and communication with educators, they have the potential to scaffold children’s English and Mandarin vocabulary learning and encourage children’s participation in educator-led activities. This finding is also supported by the current evidence on the impacts of translanguaging on promoting vocabulary learning and boosting classroom participation in ECEC (Pontier, Destro Boruchowski, and Olivo 2020).

Lastly, educators also used the focal infants’ home language for providing emotional support or regulating behaviour, especially during transition time. Such functions of translanguaging have been reported on older children in school settings. For example, Tai (2023a) reported observations of a teacher using translanguaging between English and Cantonese to manage students’ disruptive behaviours in order to provide a positive atmosphere in a Hong Kong high school EnglishMedium-Instruction classroom. Particularly, Tai (2023a) observed that teachers created a translanguaging space to maintain control and prevent any potential tension between the teacher and the students, as well as to ensure the students retain their attention on learning content and engage in classroom interactions. In our study, educators also used Mandarin to help avoid negative emotions and retain control during transition time. While the children in our study are much younger, it appears that translanguaging can serve the broad function of encouraging participation and ensuring a smooth flow of experiences. By suggesting that translanguaging strategies can support very young children’s social-emotional regulation as well as their language learning, our study reinforces the multi-functional benefit of using translanguaging in early childhood settings, that is, beyond school contexts.

All the educators in this study flexibly used a range of infant-oriented, interaction promoting and language-modelling strategies in both English and Mandarin alongside other multimodal resources to facilitate translanguaging practices. This reflected educators’ awareness of ways to support bilingual infants’ language learning and engage them in conversations. As these strategies can further strengthen the translanguaging practices, they are also significant elements of ‘global early childhood education (GECE)’ (Kultti 2022a). For instance, the infant-oriented approach, following the child’s lead/interest, can be linked with implementing the child’s knowledge/experience during interactions from GECE (Kultti 2022a).

As there is lack of research on educators’ translanguaging practices with infants, our findings contribute to the currently very limited knowledge of translanguaging in supporting infants’ learning and development. However, as our study focused on one-to-one interactions between bilingual Mandarin-English infants and educators, its findings cannot be generalised to translanguaging in group interactions or to other languages. It could also be possible we missed translanguaging practices that occurred during group time or other transition time such as mealtime. While this focus was outside the scope of our study, future research should also examine the relationship between particular language promoting strategies and infants’ responses to these strategies. Future, longitudinal studies could also examine the effectiveness of educators’ translanguaging pedagogies on bilingual children’s language outcomes.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this study addresses a gap in previous research on the language learning of children under two in ECEC contexts and adds to the existing body of knowledge on translanguaging in infant-educator interactions. Specifically, our findings reveal the power of translanguaging in ECEC daily routines and playful environments. That is, to help bilingual children not only develop their full linguistic repertoires, but also understand the world and how to interact with others using both their languages and other multimodal resources. Our study can also deepen educators’ understanding of the value of translanguaging for encouraging bilingual children’s participation and supporting their wellbeing, fostering a sense of belonging and becoming. We recommend that policy-makers and centre managers should provide more support on professional developments that facilitate educators’ knowledge of bilingualism in infancy, so that more bilingual infants can benefit from these strategies identified by our study. Such actions could contribute to reducing bilingual children’ potential risks of language delay or other language developmental challenges, and further reduce any possible social inequities of language environments.
