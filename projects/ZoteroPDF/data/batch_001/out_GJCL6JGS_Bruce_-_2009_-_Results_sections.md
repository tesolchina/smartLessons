# Abstract

This paper reports a genre study of the Results sections of two samples of 20 research-reporting articles from two disciplines: sociology and organic chemistry. Following the proposal of Bhatia (2004) that genre knowledge needs to be investigated from two perspectives, an ethnographic perspective and a textual perspective, the Results sections are analysed in terms of the social genre/cognitive genre model of Bruce (2008b). The ethnographic dimension of the investigation involves a semi-structured interview with a sociologist and an organic chemist, revealing significant differences between the two disciplines in terms of social genre elements of context, epistemology and writer stance in reporting the Results of research. The textual investigation involves rater analysis of two samples of 20 Results sections from three nominated journals to which the two interviewees frequently refer. The texts are analysed in relation to the cognitive genre model, the analysis revealing consistent differences in the textual resources employed in each subject, with sociology Results sections mainly employing the cognitive genre termed Report and organic chemistry Results sections employing the Explanation cognitive genre.

# 1. Introduction

Most of the models proposed for the concept of communicative competence in a language include the component of discourse competence (Canale, 1983; Canale & Swain, 1980; Celce-Murcia & Dornyei, 1995; Council } of Europe, 2001) or textual competence (Bachman, 1990). Discourse competence refers to the ability to communicate through extended spoken or written texts that are characterized by an appropriate, integrated arrangement of content information and language. Developing this idea, Bhatia (2004) proposes that students wishing to participate in the discourses of a particular academic or professional community need to develop what he terms a discursive competence, which includes the three subsuming areas of social competence, generic competence and textual competence.

[Social competence] incorporates an ability to use language more widely to participate effectively in a variety of social and institutional contexts to give expression to one’s social identity, in the context of constraining social structures and social processes....

[Generic competence] means the ability to identify, construct, interpret and successfully exploit a specific repertoire of professional, disciplinary or workplace genres to participate in the daily activities and to achieve the goals of a specific professional community...

[Textual competence] represents not only an ability to master the linguistic code, but also an ability to use textual, contextual and pragmatic knowledge to construct and interpret... texts (pp. 144–145).

In the teaching of academic writing, genre-based approaches have been seen as a way of uncovering the knowledge required to assist student writers to develop the discourse (or discursive) competence necessary to process and create extended texts within a particular academic or professional discourse community. However, a problem with this is that the various approaches to identifying genres (as systematic classifiers of written or spoken texts) are not stable. When it comes to defining genres, there is a multiplicity of overlapping theories along with a range of competing terminologies (see Hyon, 1996; Johns, 2002). For some, the classification of texts in terms of genre is largely a social phenomenon. They see genre as being reflected primarily in the social actions and functionally related sections of whole texts, for example: legal cases, research articles and dissertations (see, for example, Bhatia, 1993, 2004; Swales, 2004). For others, the classification of texts, in terms of genre, is a rhetorically motivated, cognitive phenomenon, often described in terms of categories such as: argument, explanation, recount and description (see, for example, Knapp & Watkins, 2005; Macken-Horarik, 2002).

For purpose of writing pedagogy, two schools of genre theory have been frequently drawn upon: one is the approach of genre theorists influenced by systemic functional linguistics (Eggins, 1994; Hasan, 1989; Martin, 1986, 1992, 1997, 2000; Ventola, 1985); and the other is the Specific Purposes approach (Bhatia, 1993, 1998, 2004; Dudley-Evans, 1986, 1989, 1993, 1994; Johns, 1997, 2001; Swales, 1981, 1988, 1990, 1998, 2004). In their original forms, both approaches to genre involve identifying a recurrent pattern commonly used to organize the content of a genre (category of texts), and then relating the stages of this content-organizing pattern to specific linguistic features. It is interesting, however, to note that a large-scale, computer-mediated corpus study by Biber (1989) does not support the idea of characterizing genres in terms of linguistic features. His conclusion was ‘‘[g]enres are defined and distinguished on the basis of systematic non-linguistic criteria, and they are valid in those terms” (p. 39). On the other hand, in his corpus study, Biber did find systematic occurrences of linguistic patterns within more general, non-genre-specific text types, four of which he found commonly occurred in academic English prose. More recently text types have also been identified by corpus analysis of the clustering of vocabulary-based discourse patterns (VBDUs), referring to ‘‘a block of discourse defined by its reliance on a particular set of words” (Biber, Csomay, Jones, & Keck, 2007, p. 156).

Similarly, Brian Paltridge’s (1993, 1997) research, which employed the approach to genre influenced by systemic functional linguistics, also challenges claims of deterministic relationships between recurrent contentorganizing patterns and linguistic features. As a result, Paltridge (2002) argues that academic writing courses need to focus on both genre and text type knowledge. Paltridge illustrates this through the example of the everyday genre of letters to the editor, which may be realized by different text types according to the varying communicative purposes of writers. The dual approach to levels of genre knowledge is also supported by both Pilegaard and Frandsen (1996), who propose text genres and text types, and Bhatia (2004), who distinguishes between rhetorical acts/generic values, (such as description and evaluation) and genre colonies (such as promotional genres) and their particular realizations as genres, such as book blurbs and advertisements (p. 59). To account for these two areas, Bhatia proposes that genre knowledge needs to be investigated from two perspectives: an ethnographic perspective and a textual perspective (p. 163). Thus, in my own research and work on developing materials for academic writing courses, I have attempted to account for these two areas of knowledge by proposing a dual approach to genre: that of social genre and cognitive genre (Bruce, 2005, 2008a, 2008b).

Social genre – socially recognized constructs according to which whole texts are classified in terms of their overall social purpose. Purpose here is taken to mean the intention to consciously communicate a body of knowledge related to a certain context to a certain target audience...

Cognitive genre – the overall cognitive orientation and internal organization of a segment of writing that realizes a single, more general rhetorical purpose to represent one type of information within discourse. Examples of types of general rhetorical purpose relating to cognitive genres are: to recount sequenced events, to explain a process, to argue a point of view, each of which will employ a different cognitive genre. (Bruce, 2008b, p. 39)

Social genres and cognitive genres are not mutually exclusive categories, but, in effect, two sides of the same coin or two complementary approaches to examining the discoursal and textual elements of a genre. The model as articulated in Bruce (2008a, p. 131) proposes that understanding the nature and operation of a social genre (such as a category of written texts within an academic or professional setting), involves knowledge relating to:

- context, which Widdowson (2004) suggests involves specialist knowledge of a field and its particular language (technical lexis);   
- epistemology, described by Lea and Street (1998) as ‘‘disciplinary assumptions about the nature of knowledge” (p. 162);   
- writer stance, involving issues of addressivity and audience, such as what Hyland (2005) describes in terms of the use of metadiscourse; and,   
- content schemata – the conventionalized, conscious staging of content in texts, such as schematic structure (Hasan, 1989) or systems of moves and steps (Swales, 1990).

Cognitive genres are complex, organizational categories that are usually drawn upon in combination when creating whole texts. They are described in terms of a model that draws upon cognitive, rather than social, or linguistic knowledge. The design of the model is constrained by three important categorization theories from cognitive science:

- a category is formed in response to purpose or intentionality (see Barsalou, 1983; Murphy & Medin, 1985). Thus, when writing, certain types of communicative purpose individually activate a prototypical textual pattern (cognitive genre).   
- complex knowledge is hierarchically organized – higher level general to lower level specific structures (see Miller, 1984; Rumelhart & Ortony, 1977). Thus, a text-organizing structure may employ different, interconnected systems of knowledge that relate.   
- creating and identifying examples of categories is in relation to knowledge and memory of prototypes (see Rosch, 1975, 1978). Therefore, creating extended written text involves drawing on knowledge of prototypical organizational patterns.

Taking these principles and their implications into account, I have proposed models for four cognitive genres that commonly occur in academic English prose. Table 1 following summarizes the proposed cognitive genre model and its constituent knowledge types.

The four cognitive genres are based on the four text types that Biber (1989, p. 39) found to occur most frequently in academic prose. Biber’s findings emerged from an extensive corpus study although his typology has been critiqued in relation to the types of texts included in the corpus and the opaqueness of some of his terminologies (Santini, 2005). However, since the four text types relating to academic written prose largely mirror those of the typology of Quinn (1993) based on needs analysis, they are selected to form the basis for the cognitive genre model. In terms of their structure and internal organization, they are conceptualized here in terms of top–down, cognitive structure rather than by their linguistic and stylistic features:

Drawing on the first principle from categorization theory – that categories are formed in response to intention or purpose – each category of the model relates to a general rhetorical aim to communicate a certain type of knowledge – this is the rhetorical focus for each of the four types in Table 1. Drawing on the second principle (that complex knowledge is hierarchically organized), they have a top–down, internal structure that involves:

(Bruce, 2005, p. 14).

- Gestalts called image schemata (Johnson, 1987). At the upper levels of the model, the rhetorical purpose will engage a high-order, image schema gestalt pattern (see Johnson, 1987) in order to broadly structure the content knowledge to be represented within the particular segment of text that realizes the cognitive genre. This is based on the idea that gestalts provide a basis for upper level categorization in the way proposed by Lakoff (1987, p. 283) in his spatialization of form hypothesis.   
- Discourse patterns (Hoey, 1983, 1994, 2001). While gestalts (image schemata) refer to the organization of concepts or ideas, in relation to the overall organization of the actual written text, they lead to the engagement of non-genre-specific discourse patterns (e.g. General–Particular, Problem–Solution), which have typical patterns of co-occurrence (see Hoey, 1983).   
- Interpropositional relations (Crombie, 1985). The rhetorical focus (purpose) also influences selection from a specific set of lower-order, more specific, cognitive categories termed interpropositional relations (e.g. Reason–Result, Chronological Sequence, Condition Consequence), which always have two parts in that they involve a relation between two propositions.

Interpropositional relations involve making connections that draw upon both semantic and pragmatic knowledge, and they have a direct effect on linguistic selection relating to cohesion and coherence. Thus, the social genre/cognitive genre approach to text classification is proposed as a basis for performing genre analysis that accounts for the socially constructed, rhetorical organizational and linguistic elements of genres as categories of texts. As an example of the implementation of this integrative approach, this article reports a study of the part-genre of Results sections (of research-reporting articles) from the two disciplines of sociology and organic chemistry.

# 1.1. Previous studies of Results sections

Previous studies that have examined Results sections include those of Brett (1994), who examined the results sections from 20 sociology research articles and Williams (1999), who analysed eight medical research articles. Brett (1994) employed what he calls three communicative categories: metatextual, presentation and comment:

Metatextual defines parts of the text that refer to the data or to other written sections; it is text about the text,... guiding the reader to other parts of the writing... Presentation categories are those which objectively and impersonally report, present, or highlight the results or the ways in which they were obtained... Comment categories are those in which authors offer their own interpretation of, or comment and opinion about the results already presented, building up on the Presentation categories (p. 52).

In the sociology Results sections of his sample, Brett proposes that the occurrence of the three organizational categories is cyclical, the most frequent pattern being pointer (metatextual) followed by statement of finding (Presentation), and substantiation of the finding (Presentation). He describes each of the three communicative categories in terms of their linguistic features.

Williams (1999) analysed a sample of eight medical research articles using a modified version of Brett’s (1994) model of communicative categories. Williams found Brett’s model to be ‘‘an adequate basic model for the rhetorical categories of Results sections for interdisciplinary genre analysis” (p. 362). However, he observed that the cyclical patterning identified in Brett’s study was less common in biomedical articles (where the results section tended to be presented in a more linear way). He, therefore, suggests that both type of study and subject matter influence text organization, which may be either chronological, hierarchical or climactic. What this may suggest is that more general rhetorical patterns (operationalized here by cognitive genres) may be central to the discourse organization of the texts of the sample, something that is the focus of the study reported here.

In another approach to describing the organizational patterns used in the type of writing that occurs in Results sections, Swales and Feak (2004, p. 116), in an academic writing textbook, propose that writing, which they term data commentary, uses a framework that includes: locating elements or summary statements (similar to Brett’s metatextual ‘pointer’), highlighting statements and discussions of the findings, such as implications problems and exceptions. In relation to the latter category, they cite a corpus study by Thompson (1993), which categorizes the types of discussion statements found in Results sections.

In examining Results (and Discussions) sections in a sample of 20 Applied Linguistics articles, Yang and Allison (2003) proposed a six move structure for Results sections of: preparatory information, reporting results, summarising results, commenting on results, evaluating the study and deductions from the research. They describe the first three as ‘‘dominant moves” (p. 373). Significantly, in their analysis Yang and Allison also signal the need to acknowledge two levels of textual organization – moves and steps: ‘‘our use of two levels, Move and Step, serves to distinguish the communicative purposes from the rhetorical techniques realizing the purposes” (p. 376) – emphasis added.

As part of a more recent study, Kanoksilapatham (2005) and Kanoksilapathan (2007) describes the Results sections of a corpus of 60 biochemistry articles in terms of a content-organizing schema of four moves (that may vary in order and may occur cyclically): restating methodological issues, justifying methodological issues, announcing results, commenting on results. Each move contains a number of sub-moves or steps. In relation to each step, an illustrative sentence is presented and described in terms of its content-organizing role, and the 2007 report of the same research provides a detailed corpus analysis of the linguistic features of the move structure.

Thus, drawing mainly on the ESP approach to genre, previous studies of Results sections have mostly tended to focus on text-organizing structures, either in terms of more general communicative categories (and their sequencing) or of a more specific content schema (move/step) structure. These structures are then linked to particular linguistic features. While there are some similarities in the patterns proposed, there also appears to be variation between disciplines, but ‘presenting’ and ‘commenting on’ results appear to be obligatory stages in most disciplines although they may not always occur in a linear way.

In the study reported here, the Results sections from research articles in two disciplines (sociology and organic chemistry) are examined in terms of the social genre/cognitive genre model as a way of extending or broadening the notion of what it is that constitutes knowledge of a genre to include its socially constructed, general rhetorical and linguistic dimensions.

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Social genre analysis

The ethnographic (social genre) dimension of this study involves a semi-structured interview with a sociologist and a chemist (see Appendix A for the interview schedule) as well as the analysis of Results sections from research-reporting articles – 20 from sociology and 20 from chemistry. The articles for the samples were selected from the three academic journals to which the two interviewees most frequently refer in their respective field. (The reference lists of the two samples are presented in Appendix B.)

To carry out the interviews, a sociologist and organic chemist were approached and gave their consent to be interviewed for this study. Both interviewees are research-active, have achieved multiple publications and are teaching faculty members of two tertiary institutions (a polytechnic and a university). After obtaining the necessary ethical consents and following the question schedule in Appendix A, the subjects were interviewed, in relation to subject-specific contextual knowledge, epistemology and writer stance. The textual analysis (of social genre elements) focused on the use of metadiscourse features (Hyland, 2005, p. 49) and whether or not there were content-organizing schemata in the samples of Results sections from the two disciplines, such as Swales’ (1990) move and step structures.

# 2.2. Cognitive genre analysis

To investigate the textual dimension, the Results sections of the two samples were scanned into plain text files and analysed in two ways. First, they were rater-analysed by the author in relation to their use of the features of the cognitive genre model. Following a bottom–up approach, a copy of each text was marked up with the cognitive genre elements of interpropositional relations, discourse patterns and gestalt structures. Because the sets of characteristics of the cognitive genre model are proposed as prototypical discourse patterns, a text segment that realizes a particular cognitive genre may be highly prototypical (i.e., employ most of the characteristics of a cognitive genre from the model) or more peripheral (i.e., employ some or few of its characteristics). Thus, conformity to the cognitive genre model is by degree. In this study, however, there was no attempt to grade the degree of prototypicality of segments of texts (in relation to the cognitive genre model). The rater standard that was used was where a text segment appeared to conform mostly to the features of a particular cognitive genre category, it was classified in terms of that category. The social genre elements of metadiscourse devices (relating to author stance) were also marked on each text (see Appendix C, Figs. A1 and A2, for examples of two marked up texts).

Secondly each sample of texts was examined using corpus software, Oxford Wordsmith Tools 4.0 (Scott, 2004). The corpus of sociology results sections consists of 28,268 tokens (running words) and the organic chemistry corpus consists of 29,663 tokens. A word list was created for each sample of Results sections and concordance searches were performed on frequently occurring cohesive devices. The purpose of the corpus analysis was to provide objective, linguistic data that can be compared with the rater analysis of cohesion and coherence in terms of Crombie’s (1985) interpropositional relations.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. The social genre elements of Results sections

In the interviews with the sociologist and the organic chemist, questions (Appendix A) were posed in relation to the social genre elements of context, epistemology, writer stance and schematic structure.

# 3.1.1. Context

The sociologist interviewed describes her subject as the study of ‘‘inter-human behaviour, in terms of interrelationships and interactions”. On the other hand, the organic chemist said that his subject is concerned with examining ‘‘carbon-containing compounds, most of which are involved with life processes”. Both informants

reported that their respective fields had widely used, subject-specific vocabulary as well as terminologies specific to sub-branches of their disciplines.

# 3.1.2. Epistemology

In sociology, the approach to research varies from scientific or positivist through to naturalistic or interpretative. Thus, data from research may be either quantitative or qualitative (or often a combination of the two). The sociologist reported that her research follows a naturalistic or interpretative approach. She uses ethnomethodology as a research style, and one of the data collection methods that she uses is interview. However, the same informant said that her earlier training and experiences had been within the positivist tradition.

Research in organic chemistry uses a positivist or scientific approach, where on the basis of present knowledge of chemical compounds and their constituencies, new ‘target’ compounds are proposed and investigated following established techniques and procedures. The data tends to be quantitative, but can also involve some qualitative descriptions of the appearance of compounds, such as their colour and shape.

# 3.1.3. Writer stance

The sociologist informant proposed that the reporting of research findings has to acknowledge multiple views of reality. Not only does the reporting of findings need to account for the multiplicity of intentions and views of the human subjects of the research, but also the writer has to anticipate and pre-empt multiple critiques or interpretations of their findings by readers. The style of sociology writing may range from personal to impersonal.

In the reporting of findings from organic chemistry research, the informant suggested that key values are the need for preciseness of detail as well as conciseness. As part of this precision of specification, the writer often provides familiar landmarks in terms of named processes and named analytical techniques.

Also, in relation to writer stance the two samples of texts were examined for their use of metadiscourse devices (as summarized by Hyland, 2005, p. 49).

- In the sample of sociology texts, all 20 used endophoric references (references to tables, figures and other parts of the text). Ten of the 20 texts were reported in the first person. Twelve of the 20 used evidentials (quoted other writers to support assertions) and 14 used hedges – (usually modal) structures to weaken (or make more cautious) claims or statements.   
- In the organic chemistry texts, all 20 texts used endophoric reference (to tables, figures), 13 used self-mention (usually the first person plural) and eight used evidentials (usually referring to named chemical processes).

From the interviews and from the textual analysis of the two samples, the principal difference in stance that emerged was the need in sociology to present findings in ways that allow for multiple meanings and views, which contrasts with the need for precise specification of detail in reporting research results in organic chemistry. This difference was evident in the use of metadiscourse in the two samples with the extensive use of hedging (cautious language) in 14 of the sociology texts, while hedging was largely absent from the chemistry texts. Examples of hedging from sociology are:

‘‘It seems likely that her anger at him then provoked his feeling angry in Time 2. This suggests a pattern...”[emphasis added] (Sociology Text 1);

‘‘These results suggest that the positive effect of non-resident children is a least partially explained by visitation” (Sociology Text 5).

The need for precise writer specification in organic chemistry results appeared to lead to the frequent use of nominalised structures and quantification. For example:

‘‘Dibromocyclopropanation of vinylferrocene proceeded without any difficulties, and 1,1-dibromo2ferrocenylcylopropane (3) was isolated in high yield $( 7 0 - 8 0 \% )$ (Chemistry Text 10).

# 3.1.4. Schematic structure

In examining the Results section texts from both sociology and organic chemistry, no clear conventionalized patterns of content organization emerged. In the sociology texts, the findings in eleven of the articles organized around specific research questions (or sub-headings related to research questions), while in nine the findings were combined in a more unified way. In the sample of organic chemistry texts, 10 were organized around research questions (or related sub-headings) and 10 were more unified texts. Of the nine unified texts in the sociology sample, seven focussed solely on presenting findings, while two followed the presentation with some comment on the findings. In one case the shift (from presentation to comment) was signalled by: ‘‘It could be suggested that this greater involvement may have come about through...” (Sociology, Text 8); in the other text this shift was signalled by ‘‘As noted above, differences in household structure could influence....” (Sociology, Text 11). With the 10, more unified organic chemistry texts, the content focus was diverse: five texts provided an explanatory presentation of the findings, three texts provided an explanatory presentation followed by some comment on the findings and two texts focused on a discussion of the findings. Since no clear content schemata emerged from the analysis, it is proposed that it is more salient to consider the Results sections of the two samples in terms of the types of rhetorical purpose and related textual resources (cognitive genres) that are employed. This is the focus of the next section of the analysis.

# 3.2. The cognitive genre elements of Results sections

# 3.2.1. Sociology Results sections

Rater analysis of the sociology Results sections in relation to the cognitive genre model found that they employed a range of textual resources (Table 2 following), but they mostly used the cognitive genre termed Report, often recursively – several small, adjacent reports. In some cases the recursion is signalled by subheadings or separate research questions used as sub-headings. In other cases, there are rhetorical shifts within the text from one cognitive genre to another. For example, in Text 11 of the sociology sample, the cognitive genre pattern is Report, Discussion and Report. The first Report presents data comparing household unemployment rates in three countries. A Discussion follows considering three possible reasons for the differences between the three countries including evidence for and against those reasons.

Table 2 The use of cognitive genres in sociology Results sections.

A number in parenthesis shows the number of occurrences of a cognitive genre within a Results section. In some cases different cognitive genres are adjacent to each other (No. 1) or embedded within each other (No. 3).

In the case of Report, it is proposed in the cognitive genre model (Table 1) that one of the most frequently occurring interpropositional relations (Crombie, 1985) will be Amplification. The rater analysis of interpropositional relations in the sociology texts, in fact, found that Amplification was the most frequently occurring relation, comprising $2 1 . 5 \%$ of the total number of relations in the sample. This was followed by Simple Contrast $( 1 7 \% )$ , Reason Result $( 9 \% )$ , Concession Contraexpectation $( 6 . 6 \% )$ , Grounds Conclusion $( 5 . 7 \% )$ and Simple Comparison $( 4 . 5 \% )$ .

The two most frequently occurring relations – Amplification and Simple Contrast are explained in Table 3 following.

As Table 3 indicates, the Amplification relation can be realized by a main clause followed by either an object noun clause or dependent (restrictive) relative clause, both types of clause often being headed by the conjunction ‘that’. The Simple Contrast relation is often signalled by ‘than’. In order to provide a comparison with the rater analysis, these features were investigated further using corpus software, Oxford Wordsmith Tools 4.0 (Scott, 2004). The sample of sociology articles formed a small corpus of 28,268 tokens (running words) and a word list was created. Table 4 following is the part of the wordlist showing the 20 most frequently occurring function words.

The wordlist showed high frequencies of ‘that’ (301 occurrences) and ‘than’ (136 occurrences). Creating a concordance of the 301 occurrences of ‘that’ and searching their contexts found that 189 introduced noun clauses (as objects or complements of verbs), 73 introduced relative clauses and 39 occurrences belong to other word classes, supporting the rater analysis finding of a high frequency of the Amplification relation. Similarly, a concordance was generated for the 136 instances of ‘than’, of which 92 were found to signal the Simple Contrast relation between propositions. (Within the texts, contrast was also signalled in a variety of other ways.)

# 3.2.2. Organic chemistry results sections

Table 5 shows the cognitive genres identified by the rater analysis of the organic chemistry Results sections. These texts mainly used the Explanation cognitive genre, again often recursively, such as several short explanations. The Discussion cognitive genre also occurred in eight of the texts. One of the reasons for this use of Discussion cognitive genre is that some of the leading Chemistry journals are now joining together (conflating) the Results and Discussion section of research-reporting articles.

The rater analysis showed that the organic chemistry results sections mainly employed Explanation cognitive genre, in which the model (see Table 1) proposes the most frequently occurring interpropositional relations (Crombie, 1985) will be Means Result and Means Purpose – these are relations that both focus on how something is achieved (see Table 6).

A number in parenthesis shows the number of occurrences of a cognitive genre within a Results section.

The rater analysis of interpropositional relations in the organic chemistry texts found that, together, the relations ‘Means Result’ and ‘Means Purpose’ accounted for $2 5 . 5 \%$ of the relations in the total sample $1 7 . 7 \%$ and $7 . 8 \%$ , respectively). These were followed by Reason Result $( 1 4 . 8 \% )$ and Amplification $( 1 2 . 6 \% )$ .

To further investigate the rater analysis of the interpropositional relations, the sample of 20 organic chemistry Results sections was also searched using corpus software, Oxford Wordsmith Tools 4.0 (Scott, 2004). The corpus of chemistry texts comprised 29,633 tokens (running words). First, a word list was created. Table 7 following is part of the wordlist showing the 20 most frequently occurring function words in the Sociology Results section sample.

The wordlist showed a high frequency of ‘by’. Creating a concordance of the 192 occurrences of ‘by’ and searching their contexts found that 107 (in 19 texts) were part of structures that signalled means (in a Means Result relation). Of these instances of ‘by’:

- 72 involved the structure ‘by $^ +$ nominalization’. For example: ‘‘On the other hand, the reaction (2) can be monitored by measurement of the free iodine released.” (Chemistry Text 2); and,   
- 35 involved the structure ‘by $^ +$ verb(ing)’ structure. For example: ‘‘The assumption was verified by introducing the liposomic part eluted from the column into the DPP system.” (Chemistry Text 1)

Similarly, a concordance was generated for the 508 instances of ‘to’ of which 51 occurrences (in 15 texts) signalled purpose in a Means Purpose relation.

# 4. Discussion

The findings from this study appear to demonstrate that, in the reporting of research results in the two subjects (sociology and organic chemistry), the written texts and the discourses that surround these texts are quite different. These differences appear to arise from the objects of enquiry, epistemological viewpoints and research paradigms and textual structures characteristic of the two disciplines. However, because the samples used were small and it was not logistically possible to employ multiple raters to analyse the cognitive genre patterns (and then compare the raters’ findings), the results from this study can be only considered to be indicative. In the discussion that follows, possible implications of the findings will be discussed in relation to pedagogy and its wider implications for the conceptualization of genres.

In relation to pedagogy, it is suggested that genre knowledge is used in two areas of activity: to provide a heuristic for the analysis of further texts (of the same genre); and to provide the means for writers to create their own texts within the same discipline. Genre-based pedagogy that attempts to teach the writing of Results sections should clearly include a focus on both the social and cognitive genre dimensions of the target genre. In relation to pedagogy, it is suggested here that when examining the Results section of a particular discipline, it is salient first to examine the social genre influences that surround the part-genre in order to establish a grounded view of the part-genre. This will involve consideration of issues of context, content, epistemology (including research methodology), writer stance and issues of addressivity and audience. Students may be able to do this partly by carrying out their own simple ethnographic enquiries along the lines of the interview schedule used in this study (see Appendix A). The social genre focus can then be followed by deconstructing and practising the cognitive genre elements of exemplar texts which, it is proposed, will assist in providing writers with tools to achieve finer grained analysis of the textual elements of Results sections in particular disciplines as well as the procedural knowledge necessary to create their own.

In relation to genre theory generally, this study appears to present a further challenge to a unitary approach to operationalizing genre in terms of a schematic structure (or a move and step structure) to account for the staging of content linked to discrete items of lexis, grammar and syntax. Bhatia (2004), Biber (1989), Paltridge (2002) and Pilegaard and Frandsen (1996) all argue that an adequate approach to genre involves examining both socially constructed genre knowledge and more general, rhetorical knowledge. The social genre/cognitive genre approach employed here further advances this dual approach to genre knowledge in terms of presenting an approach to operationalizing these two areas of knowledge for pedagogical purposes.
