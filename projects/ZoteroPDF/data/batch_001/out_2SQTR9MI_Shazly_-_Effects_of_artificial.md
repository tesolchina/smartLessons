# Abstract

Foreign language anxiety (FLA) has been a perennial concern in language learning, as foreign language (FL) learners often communicate feelings of anxiety, stress, or nervousness. This study explored the role of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in speaking practice for FLA management of 48 undergraduate participants in an EFL class in Egypt. An eight-week, quasi-experimental pretest–posttest design examined learner anxiety levels using a 33-item FLA questionnaire. Their oral proficiency was assessed via roleplaying using an interaction-enhanced public version of the IELTS speaking evaluation rubric. The results confirmed that FL learners experienced FLA pre- and post-intervention. The identified anxiety levels played a facilitative role in FL learning with several ensuing gains. The use of conversationally enhanced AI chatbots in interactive activities slightly intensified learners' FLA, thus meriting further investigation of these objectives. Overall, subject to further development, AI chatbots are promising for significantly improving linguistic output gains; however, this study found that learners' speech-related anxieties were not reduced following the interactions with the chatbots. It is concluded that FLA plays an underexplored facilitative role in sharpening learner cognitive faculties and linguistic capacities. Moreover, AI chatbots may be beneficial in advancing FL learning with significant potential in EFL contexts, facilitating improved interaction and oral communication. These findings support the integration of AI technologies as effective tools in FL education, providing flexible, interactive, and learner-centred learning. This study is expected to be of considerable interest to FL educators and learners.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

English communication skills are crucial for advancing people's social lives and careers. For foreign language (FL) learners, however, enhancing orality may prove difficult when the use of the model target language (TL) and opportunities for practice are scarce (Fryer & Carpenter, 2006). The inability to obtain this communication goal is documented in FL acquisition literature (He, 2018; Horwitz et al., 1986; Kitano, 2001), even with advanced learners (Marcos-Llinás & Garau, 2009; Woodrow, 2006). Learners often communicate feelings of anxiety, stress, or nervousness, and speaking is generally considered the most anxiety-provoking element (He, 2018; Kitano, 2001; Woodrow, 2006).

For the optimal realization of oral communication, two key elements are required: comprehensible input and social interaction (Ellis, 2005; Krashen, 1982). FL learning is essentially a socio-cultural experience; thus, interaction remains an integral part of language learning and teaching (Brown, 2007; Ellis, 2005). FL learning classrooms should incorporate sufficient comprehensible input as well as unthreatening two-way communication. Krashen (1982) contended that comprehensible input and a learning-conducive affective filter are crucial in enabling input to lead to learning. This filter serves as a vital psychological function through which the FL input is facilitated or hindered in relation to cognitive processing.

Oral communication skills refer to the process of producing, receiving, and processing of information to formally or informally express meaning and maintain social relationships (Brown, 2001). Engagement in oral communication depends not only on learners' speaking and active listening abilities, but also on their affective state. Affective psychological variables such as motivation, attitude, self-confidence, risk-taking, and anxiety activate the affective state (Krashen, 1982). From a psychological perspective, three different types of anxiety have been identified: trait, state, and situation-specific (MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991; Teimouri et al., 2019). Situation-specific anxiety is a constant negative feeling that is mainly stimulated by a particular situation, such as a test, public speaking event, or class participation. One example of situation-specific anxiety is foreign language anxiety (FLA), as it is unique to FL learning situations and is independent of other anxiety types (Horwitz, 2017; MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991; Woodrow, 2006). Horwitz et al. (1986) contended that anxious learners experience complex feelings of apprehension, worry, fear, lack of concentration, forgetfulness, and heart palpitations.

The literature confirms that there is a substantial relationship between FLA and oral communication as top anxiety index (Horwitz et al., 1986; Woodrow, 2006). Limited systematic work has addressed the management of FLA by curbing it to a degree at which it may be permeable to FL learning in foreign language contexts. More restricted research has investigated FLA in the Middle East, particularly in speaking, where the majority of communication takes place in FL classrooms with limited access and exposure to spontaneous TL (Attia, 2015; Lee & Park, 2019). The current study aims to explore the role of AI in speaking practice in FLA management and FL speaking ability in an EFL classroom. Investigating FLA in speaking within the context of English as a foreign language (EFL), which is an under-researched area, will contribute to the literature on FLA in language acquisition while providing insight into various cultural backgrounds. Research into the effects of AI-driven chatbots in managing FLA and how they can improve English speaking proficiency will benefit FL learners, educators, designers, and researchers. This paper contrib utes to AI technology and FLA scholarship with an interactionist-intervention design using a mix of textual and auditory AI-driven chatbots' conversations which can stimulate productive FLA and promote English orality. It offers FL educators and designers with insights into how learners can achieve their communicative and educational goals using AI-driven virtual partners to substitute the inaccessible native speakers, advancing human-computer interaction scholarship. A further contribution of this research is its mixed-model design, as the majority of FLA research has been quantitative (Teimouri et al., 2019). This study aims to answer the following research questions relating to FLA and AI-driven applications among Egyptian EFL learners:

RQ1: To what extent is FLA manifested in Egyptian learners of EFL? RQ2: What is the role of AI-driven chatbots in FLA management? RQ3: What is the role of AI-driven chatbots in FL speaking?

# 2 LITERATURE REVIEW

FLA has been a perennial concern in SLA scholarship for the past several decades (Alpert & Haber, 1960; Bao, 2019; Gkonou et al., 2017; He, 2018; Horwitz, 2010, 2017; Horwitz et al., 1986; Oflaz, 2019; Teimouri et al., 2019; Toyama & Yamazaki, 2018; Young, 1991). Horwitz et al. (1986) defined it as “a distinct complex of self-perceptions, beliefs, feelings, and behaviours related to classroom language learning” (p. 128). However, Scovel (1978) argued that anxiety is “neither a simple nor well-understood psychological construct and that it is perhaps premature to attempt to relate it to the global and comprehensive task of language acquisition” (p. 132). In addition, Scovel (2001) ranked FLA as second only to motivation in affecting FL learning.

Horwitz et al. (1986) identified the three inter-related dimensions of FLA: communication apprehension (CA), fear of negative evaluation (FNE), and test anxiety (TA). CA represents a fear of communicating with people; it manifests as difficulty expressing oneself or listening to a spoken message and emerges in public speaking or within group communication. Anxious FL learners who experience CA find difficulty not only in speaking, but also in comprehending messages which is essentially related to oral communication (Horwitz et al., 1986). They often complain of sound distortion and struggle to differentiate sounds and structures. FNE involves feeling nervous about evaluations from others, evading evaluative situations, refraining from participation, and the expectancy of deleterious judgements (Kitano, 2001). It develops from a learner's need to make a positive social impression. Young (1991) postulated that anxious learners harbour egregiously biased perceptions of their language skills compared to their peers, considering themselves linguistically inferior. Furthermore, learners are apprehensive of appearing awkward or incompetent before others (Teimouri et al., 2019). Finally, TA refers to academic evaluation apprehension and the fear of failing in tests. This three-way model (Horwitz, 2010) represents the constructs that were deployed to evaluate learner FLA using the foreign language classroom anxiety scale (FLCAS).

FL learning is a sophisticated SLA experience in which FLA may either debilitate or facilitate learning (Alpert & Haber, 1960; He, 2018; Kleinmann, 1977; Young, 1991). Many FL learners are prone to anxiety, despite their variability across situations and time (Gkonou et al., 2017). Several scholars have claimed that FLA may compromise learners' FL performance and achievement, leading to reticence, avoidance, and the manifestation of poor learning behaviours or physical ailments (Horwitz, 2010, 2017; MacIntyre, 2017). It may also cripple their cognitive processing (MacIntyre & Gardner, 1994) and reduce their motivation (Teimouri et al., 2019). In addition, anxiety-related thoughts may suppress cognitive resources, resulting in a limited capacity to process common cognitive demands; accordingly, anxiety-related cognition would hinder the processing of information and performance (Eysenck, 1979; He, 2018). Learners' fear of failure may undermine their cognitive capacities, thereby short-circuiting their encoding, storage, and retrieval learning processes (MacIntyre, 1995).

Contrastingly, others have argued that FLA can facilitate FL learning by gearing the learners emotionally, activating their battery of coping strategies, and prompting them to expend greater effort (Alpert & Haber, 1960; Chastain, 1975; Gkonou et al., 2017; Kleinmann, 1977; Scovel, 1978). Scovel (1978) argued that FLA emotionally gears learners towards “fighting” unfamiliar FL learning tasks. It incites them to approach new learning tasks and facilitates FL learning through emotional arousal and the deployment of coping strategies (Alpert & Haber, 1960; Chastain, 1975; Kleinmann, 1977). Marcos-Llinás and Garau (2009) contended that a medium level of FLA facilitates learning by igniting determination to conquer a challenge. Williams (1991) claimed that a low anxiety level can slightly distract learners from their learning tasks. The Yerkes– Dodson Law (1908, as cited by He, 2018) postulates a curvilinear relationship between FLA and FL outcomes as an inverted U-shape, whereby anxiety and FL performance start low and then concomitantly rise to the optimal level, at which performance peaks. However, if anxiety exceeds the optimal level, it may impair performance. Finally, both the debilitating and facilitating constructs appear to lie within an individual's affective filter, rendering a FL learner with both anxieties at mixed levels (Alpert & Haber, 1960; Gkonou et al., 2017; MacIntyre, 2017).

Learner-centred learning refers to empowering learners to make informed decision concerning their own learning and thus allowing them to claim responsibility of their own learning, thereby boosting their intrinsic motivation (Brown, 2001). Accordingly, learners' behaviours are internally-driven by their own needs and desires rather than being externally imposed by their instructors. Meanwhile cultivating and enhancing learners' autonomy, teachers become facilitators of the learning process rather than the sole source of knowledge and power.

Originating from the Vygotskian constructivist theory of learning (1978) and Long's interactionist perspective of SLA (1981), artificial intelligence (AI) applications and platforms have been employed ubiquitously for FL learning and teaching purposes by promoting FL input, output, and interaction (Bibauw et al., 2019; Clark, 2018;Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019; Zhang & Zou, 2020). FL learners become functional members of a discourse community (Lee, 2019) as they receive new linguistic forms as input (Long, 1981). They also express their intended meaning (pushed output) (Swain, 2005). Interaction furnishes learners with opportunities to notice the gap between their interlanguage (production) and virtual partners' TL structures (written or spoken), while participating in social-like activities (Lee, 2019).

Intelligent computer-assisted language learning and instruction deploys AI-affordances for effective diversified pedagogical approaches to FL learning and instruction (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019; Zhang & Zou, 2020). Luckin et al. (2016) classified AI software applications in education into three functional categories: tutoring systems, support for collaborative learning systems, and virtual reality systems. AI chatbots fall under the first category, as they are dialogue-based computer-assisted language learning systems (Bibauw et al., 2019; Luckin et al., 2016). Brennan (2006) referred to the chatbot as “an artificial construct that is designed to converse with human beings using natural language as input and output.” Assuming an interactionist perspective, chatbots facilitate social activities by stimulating intelligent and meaningful social interaction and communication (Clark, 2018). They provide diversified opportunities for meaningful FL practices with a range of modalities (textual, audio, and visual), along with salient and non-threatening feedback (Bao, 2019). AI programs chat with their users via text or speech-enhanced communication, and substantial progress has been observed in voice interaction over the past 3 years (Nordrum, 2017). Speaking-enhanced systems (such as Siri, Alexa, and Mondly) offer automatic speech recognition and computer-assisted pronunciation, whereas writing-enhanced systems (including ELIZA, Lucy, and web chatbots) provide error recognition and instantaneous feedback (Bibauw et al., 2019).

Substantial research has investigated chatbots and their role in promoting FL practices (Dizon, 2020). In general, these computer-controlled agents have enabled FL learners to practise meaningful interactions autonomously (Bibauw et al., 2019; Dizon, 2017, 2020). Chatbots provide learners with opportunities for two-way interchanges, allowing them to practice their oral output (Dizon, 2017, 2020; Golonka et al., 2014) without time and place constraints (Zhang & Zou, 2020). They offer personalized experiences that allow FL learners/users to self-regulate their learning according to their own pace, agenda, and syllabus, thereby extending their learning into their everyday lives. Moreover, they can evaluate learners by making data-driven decisions without criticizing them or pressurizing them with high-stakes reports (Bibauw et al., 2019). With stimulated discussions and simulated interactions, FL learners can identify and work on their weaknesses while eliminating the perceived threat of derogatory judgement.

These platforms analyse the learner/user abilities and appeal to their interests, engaging them in meaningful language tasks and enabling deeper involvement (Bibauw et al., 2019). Numerous language teachers have leveraged these need- and style-adaptive applications to harness optimal FL gains by connecting learning to its context (Chapelle & Sauro, 2017; Dizon, 2017, 2020; Lee, 2019; Lee & Park, 2019; Zhang & Zou, 2020). Empirical research on the integration of AI technologies into FL learning have revealed that the amount and complexity of learner language production has increased significantly with chatbots (Golonka et al., 2014; Zhang & Zou, 2020). However, some have claimed that technology-enhanced applications benefit the learning outcomes, output, interaction, affect, and motivation of learners (Alemi et al., 2015; Lee, 2019), as well as feedback and metalinguistic knowledge in and out of the classroom (Chapelle & Sauro, 2017; Dizon, 2017; Golonka et al., 2014). More recently, Dizon (2020) contended the significant encouraging impact of AI applications on FL speaking skills.

# 2.1 | Purpose of study

The literature on technology trends indicates that few pedagogy-informed empirical studies have examined the learners' particular FL learning outcomes, which this study attempts to achieve by examining FLA and FL speaking (Lee, 2019; Zhang & Zou, 2020). The current research aims to improve FL instruction-learning by managing FLA, an affective variable in FL learning. It postulates that deploying competent, non-threatening AI virtual conversational partners may alleviate the conceivable learner FLA levels meanwhile offering learners a virtual conversational partner. This contention involves the assumption that AI, as a non-judgemental facility, may alleviate the detrimental effects of FLA on the learning/use of FL English. Moreover, the role of these AI chatbots in FL speaking is examined.

# 3 | METHODOLOGY

Using a quasi-experimental mixed model design, this study aims to explore the role of AI-driven applications on anxious Egyptian EFL learners. Mixed model design was used to secure triangulation and complimentary (Creswell & Clark, 2017). A quasi-experimental design was employed because it was not logistically feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial. It employed a pretest-posttest model to generate both qualitative and quantitative data. Figure 1 shows that the qualitative data included the anxiety patterns of the investigated cohort pre-and-post-intervention using the FLCAS. The quantitative data featured the pretest-posttest oral proficiency scores, which represent the participants' oral proficiency before and after the intervention as well as the FLCAS pre-and-post-intervention numerical data (see Figure 1).

F I GU RE 1 The process followed in the study

# 3.1 | Participants

The current research involved 48 Egyptian EFL learners (two intact classes) enrolled in their first year in the Humanities department of a private higher education institution in Egypt. Out of the 48 participants, 10 either did not complete the questionnaire or attended less than $50 \%$ of the time and were subsequently removed from the study. The participants, aged 18 to 20 years (mean age $= 1 8 . 9$ ), shared the same basic demographic features (all students were Egyptians who spoke Arabic as their mother tongue, had roughly the same socio-economic background and educational level); $20 \%$ of the participants were male and $80 \%$ were female. Data of their comparable demographics were gathered in the FLCAS questionnaires. While females tend to be more anxious than their male counterparts (Attia, 2015), gender plays a small role in language anxiety among university students learning English. Thus, the gender disproportion should not impact the findings of this study due to the anxiety-prone female majority. The students' English linguistic competence was evaluated as equivalent to B1/B2 (Independent user) based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe, 2011). Despite the relatively small sample size, it was deemed representative since it was information rich and of a manageable size with Z value $= 1 . 4 4$ confidence level at $8 5 \%$ and margin of error of $10 \%$ . The sample size was deemed sufficient to investigate one independent variable and to hold the Central Limit Theorem of normal distribution. Also, similar studies in the effects of AI technology (Bao, 2019, $n = 4 0$ ; Dizon, 2020, $n = 2 8$ ) adopted even smaller sample sizes. It was information rich because it was it yielded in-depth understanding about the effects of AI-driven chatbots.

# 3.2 | Data collection

Horwitz et al. (1986) developed a 33-item self-report questionnaire (FLCAS) that utilizes a Likert scale to evaluate FLA by examining learners' apprehension level while learning FL. An example of an FLCAS item is “I can feel my heart pounding when I am going to be called on in language.” The questionnaire includes 19 items for measuring CA, 9 for FNE, and 5 for TA. Empirical research has supported the internal consistency of Horwitz's FLCAS (Horwitz, 1986, 2017; Horwitz et al., 1986; Teimouri et al., 2019) and has presented it as the most reliable and comprehensive instrument for investigating FLA levels in FL classrooms. The 33 items of the FLCAS have a high internal reliability (Cronbach's $\alpha = 0 . 9 3$ ) and a significant correlation $( \mathsf { r } = 0 . 3 6$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 7$ and $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 5 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) with FNE and TA, at $1 3 \%$ and $2 8 \%$ of explained variance, respectively. Horwitz et al. (1986) argued the FLCAS construct validity is maintained by the small amount of shared variance between it and other FLA measures. CA and TA accounted for $5 8 . 5 6 \%$ of the total variance of the FLCAS (Toyama $\&$ Yamazaki, 2018). All items produced significant corrected item-total correlations, and the test–retest reliability over 8 weeks yielded $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 8 3$ $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) (Horwitz, 1986; Horwitz & Young, 1991). It has been translated into many languages and is used to measure FLA in various countries. This study employed the original English version of FLCAS and added few questions to it to elicit the demographic features of the participants.

The 48 respondents were provided with a URL link to the online version of the FLCAS; they were asked to complete the questionnaire and submit their responses digitally to the author. Several sociodemographic questions relating to age, gender, and grade were added to the original FLCAS. It was administered to two intact classes pre- and post-intervention to evaluate whether the participants suffered any anxiety levels. The respondents were required to read each statement and select a single answer on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This scale gauged the learners' subjective feelings, perceptions, negative attitudes towards FL classes, and avoidance behaviours.

# 3.2.1 Speaking rubric and oral proficiency tests

The pretest–posttest speaking test scores represented the speaking skills of the participants in the classroom pre- and post-intervention. The speaking skills were assessed using an enhanced version of the public IELTS speaking rubric (British Council & IDP Australia: IELTS, n.d.). The author–researcher devised an additional criterion for this rubric to evaluate the participants' interaction levels with score bands of 1 to 9 (see Appendix A in Data S1). This annexed criterion measured the amount and nature of the two-way communication in learner–learner interactions. It involved evaluating the oral production strategies, including responding effectively to questions, taking and giving turns, overlapping, and adjacency pairs' use, which were exhibited in the pretest–posttest roleplays.

The 48 participants' speaking data were drawn pre-and post-intervention in the classroom from randomly paired participants using role-plays involving real life social and academic situations. The duration of the task ranged between 5–6 min. The speaking evaluation panel included the author–researcher and a blind neutral evaluator using a double coding technique to ensure a lack of bias. The inter-rater reliability was measured using Cohen's kappa (Cohen's $\kappa = 0 . 8 3$ , $9 2 \%$ a satisfactory agreement) (Cohen, 1960). The pretests and posttests were administered by the same panel to maintain continuity and reliability.

# 3.3 | Procedures

Figure 2 shows that the duration of the entire study was 8 weeks. This included the first week when they received an orientation tutorial about the study and the pre-intervention FLCAS and the oral pretest as well as the last week when they received their posttests. Classes met once a week for $1 0 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and were taught by the author–researcher as part of an English listening and speaking EFL course (course content was not altered). This course offered an appropriate context for FLA research because speaking-oriented activities tend to produce even higher anxiety among FL learners than any other in-class activities (Woodrow, 2006; Young, 1991). All participants were initially informed about the purpose and procedures of the project, and provided informed and voluntary consent. They were notified that they had the right to withdraw unreservedly without any penalties. No physical or psychological risk is involved in this study. In week two, the valid participants (38/48) completed their online FLCAS and received a project timeline. They received a 30-min online tutorial to familiarize them with the chatbots they were about to engage with. Week one also included an oral proficiency pretest evaluation using role-playing tasks involving social and academic life events, urging them to use unmonitored natural language. The test panel administered the oral proficiency pretest to evaluate the oral proficiency of the learners.

The learners received intervention from weeks two through seven for a total of $1 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ (see Figure 2). They were introduced to different unsophisticated AI-driven applications, with web chatbots (Audrey, Charles, Cristal, and Mike) (www.tolearnenglish.com) and Mondly as their written and oral communicative virtual partners, respectively. This study was restricted to one speaking and one writing mixed-initiative chatbot, namely web chatbots and Mondly (August, 2016). Mondly understands voice input and responds with a human-voice. Whereas web chatbots are semifree-dialogue systems that allow the user to manage the interaction with hardly any constraints, Mondly represents a more task-oriented dialogue system that proposes a dialogic interaction with the learners to attain a goal (i.e., ordering at a restaurant). Informed by the controlled and free practice continuum of Ellis (1988), the choice of these chatbots provided the learners with opportunities to interact in a meaning-focused system with different levels of freedom. The practice was centrally organized around dialogues as the interaction unit, rather than isolated sentences.

From weeks two through seven, the intervention and regular course curriculum were covered simultaneously. A quintessential intervention session began with a warm-up, activating the schemata of the learners with questions on 20 vocabulary expressions. Thereafter, the input phase presented them with authentic videos in various domains to expand their lexical and structural competency and improve their phonological awareness. The final $4 0 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ provided the opportunity to orally and in writing practise their output communicatively with their online chatbots. The output involved focus on a balance between meaning and form. The output focused on precision, coherence, and appropriateness of the delivered message. Their output reiteratively involved three mini-dialogues (comprising at least six exchanges) with their virtual partners on a variety of topics. These conversational turns generated interactive output as responses from the learners when they conversed with the AI chatbots. The conversations involved interactional modifications with verbal clues that the participants deployed to steer the conversation along with interactional strategies. This interaction frame was reiterated to cover at least three common but different scenarios and activities per session focusing on promoting their orality for functional linguistic ability.

F I GU RE 2 The intervention design in the study

The input phase authentic videos were drawn from AI-ridden applications that employ communicative activities, such as Duolingo, FluentU and Glossika. Mondly and the web chatbots were adopted for the output in four consecutive weeks. Using Mondly's voice recognition feature, the participants practised their pronunciation and used their speech muscles to produce English language accurately on diversified familiar and unfamiliar topics of their choice for 20 minutes per session. In addition, the web chatbots (Audrey, Charles, Cristal, and Mike) secured extensive written conversations on various topics for $2 0 \mathsf { m i n }$ . Mondly provided the participants with a prompt and they spoke into their devices, to which the chatbot responded adaptively. Both chatbots provided written and oral interactive input to leverage the participants' communicative output. They employed natural language processing and human-like intelligence, offering a range of oral and written naturalistic conversations; thus, the participants received acceptable comprehensible input and produced at least three exchanges of FL output.

This pattern was repeated at home, as frequently as the participants deemed appropriate, for at least 60 minutes per day according to their own pace and timeline (5 hours per week). They orally and in writing practised using these interactive dialogues with their virtual partners covering a variety of domains. The participants followed the suggested plan optimally, and the majority reported intense motivation to communicate using these chatbots at home. They performed various dialogues to cover a variety of social and academic topics. Compliance with the intervention protocol was ensured by means of a biweekly informal report where the participants reflected on their personal experience with the chatbots. One week later, the post-intervention FLCAS was administered, along with the oral proficiency posttest.

# 3.4 | Data analysis methods

The pretest–posttest model generated both qualitative and quantitative data. The pretest–posttest interval scores and pre- and post-intervention FLCAS ordinal data represented the numerical data. The first and second datasets were drawn from the pre-intervention FLCAS and pretest oral proficiency roleplays, and the post-intervention and posttest, respectively. Roleplays were employed to assess the learners' speaking skills in a contextualized FL learning activity approximating the socio-cultural and discourse community (Lee, 2019).

The qualitative datasets were analysed using a content analysis approach, grounded theory, and categorizing the data into patterns guided by Horwitz's proposed three-way model. The data were double-coded in multiple rounds, and a fellow researcher in applied linguistics was enlisted to secure consensus and validity. Two volunteering participants were asked to review the data analysis to ensure the validity of the identified patterns. The quantitative datasets were analysed statistically using t-tests for paired samples (Cohen et al., 2018) to identify the statistical signifi cance of the differences in the oral proficiency test scores. The FLCAS ordinal data were analysed using the Wilcoxon test (Cohen et al., 2018). This triangulation ensured a more complete understanding of FLA and the validity of the results.

# 4.1 RQ1: To what extent is FLA manifested in Egyptian learners of EFL?

RQ1 was answered using qualitative and quantitative data analysis. These data were gathered from the pre- and post-intervention FLCAS using a five-point Likert scale; however, it was treated as a three-point scale for interpretation, with “agree,” “neither agree nor disagree,” and “disagree.” The FLCAS data were calculated and the descriptive statistics were tabulated to examine the Egyptian FL learners' FLA. Thereafter, the data were analysed qualitatively using Horwitz's postulated FLA triad.

Table 1 displays the respondents suffered from certain levels of anxiety, with $4 6 \%$ agreeing with the FLCAS statements and only $3 8 \%$ disagreeing with them pre-intervention. Similarly, $51 \%$ of the respondents approved of the statements post-intervention, whereas $3 5 \%$ disapproved. Table 2 indicates that the mean agreement value in the pre- and post-intervention was 15.3 and 16.8, respectively. Thus, the Egyptian FL learners could experience certain levels of anxiety, with at least half of the sample agreeing with the FLCAS statements and reporting that they experienced CA, FNE, and TA. However, approximately one third disagreed; their anxiety levels increased slightly (by $5 \%$ ) after the intervention. Appendix B in Data S1 shows that “agree” came as the mode in the pre-and post-intervention; whereas the median of the post-intervention came out to be “strongly agree” in comparison to “neither agree nor disagree” in the post-intervention.

The FLCAS items were analysed, and almost all items followed similar patterns before and after the intervention. Items 4, 7, 11, 19, 29, 30, and 33 exhibited exceptional trajectories (see Appendix B in Data S1). Appendix B in Data S1 indicates that item 7 exhibited a mushrooming pattern, suggesting the learners' burgeoning linguistic self-confidence when they compared themselves to other learners after the intervention (from $2 9 \%$ to $4 6 \%$ ). Item 14 marked a greater willingness to communicate (WTC) (i.e. motivation) with native speakers (NSs) at $6 9 \%$ , compared to preintervention $(4 7 \% )$ . Conversely, the responses to items 4 and 29 revealed that these anxious learners began to lose their tolerance of ambiguity, which is an essential requirement for FL learning (Brown, 2007). The learners developed further FNE, as evidenced by their responses to items 19 and 33, whereby they developed strong apprehension towards the teacher's readiness to spot and correct their mistakes and appeared to deprecate their linguistic competence (from $2 9 \%$ to $4 1 \%$ and from $2 5 \%$ to $4 8 \%$ , respectively). Item 30 revealed that, following the intervention, the learners nurtured the acute misperception that they had to study an unmanageable number of rules to become adept speakers (from $2 7 \%$ to $3 5 \%$ ). Finally, item 11 indicated how learners explicitly related to anxious FL learners who became upset over the FL class (from $2 1 \%$ to $42 \%$ ). The majority of learners experienced certain levels of anxiety pre- and post-intervention.

The qualitative data were categorized into CA, FNE, and TA.

# 4.1.1 | CA

Appendix B in Data S1 indicates that CA as a construct represented $6 1 \%$ of the FLCAS. CA involves social and interpersonal aspects, as well as individual attributes (Toyama & Yamazaki, 2018). The emotional aspect of CA was examined in 12 items, and its somatic manifestations were explored in 5 items. The motivation and WTC constructs were integrated under CA as items 5, 14, 17, and 32 (see Appendix B in Data S1). Many participants recorded their motivation and WTC, with frequencies of $8 4 \%$ , $4 7 \%$ , $71 \%$ , and $4 7 \%$ pre-intervention and $7 6 \%$ , $6 9 \%$ , $71 \%$ , and $5 7 \%$ post-intervention, respectively. Moreover, $42 \%$ of the learners “never felt sure” about their communication pre-intervention, and $5 5 \%$ suffered from reduced linguistic self-efficacy post-intervention. According to the literature, limited linguistic self-confidence may inhibit learners' ability to take risks in the classroom and thereby reduce their ability to set and achieve certain linguistic goals (Brown, 2007; Teimouri et al., 2019).

However, at a manageable level, a positive effect may be observed. It is therefore debatable whether any level of anxiety may debilitate learners, or if a manageable level of anxiety along with moderate motivation may be facilitative. At present, no threshold exists between manageable and unmanageable anxiety levels, and this depends on individual differences. Pre- and post-intervention, $5 3 \%$ and $50 \%$ of the learners trembled; $2 6 \%$ and $3 6 \%$ suffered from distraction during the FL class; $6 6 \%$ and $6 8 \%$ developed forgetfulness; $5 3 \%$ and $5 8 \%$ experienced heart pounding; and finally, $2 7 \%$ and $4 8 \%$ endured confusion and nervousness, respectively. Numerous somatic anxiety symptoms were detected among the participant responses pre- and post-intervention with roughly similar percentages.

Note: ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 3 8 .$ . Bold and underlined values indicates the mean value of the learners' anxiety levels in the post-intervention was higher than the pre-intervention. Learners became more anxious after the intervention.

# 4.1.2 | FNE

Appendix B in Data S1 indicates that FNE was investigated in almost six items $( 1 8 \% )$ . FNE represented the learners' projection of others' negative judgements, including teachers and other classmates. Item 18 featured the positive aspect of FNE, with $5 5 \%$ and $60 \%$ of the learners agreeing that they felt confident when communicating using an FL pre- and post-intervention, respectively. In contrast, for items 15, 19, 23, 24, and 31, $5 3 \%$ of learners agreed that they feared negative evaluations of their teachers and fellow learners (see Appendix B in Data S1). The respondents recorded increasing apprehension that their teacher would persistently correct their mistakes, with frequencies of $3 7 \%$ and $5 3 \%$ pre- and post-intervention, respectively.

The learners' anxiety was aggravated in the second round, in which they exhibited inhibitions that they may lose control over the situation. Moreover, item 23 indicated how they developed acute apprehension that their fellow learners spoke better than they did, at $3 7 \%$ and $40 \%$ preand post-intervention, respectively. They reiteratively reported their sharp sense of self-monitoring to dodge patronisation at $52 \%$ and $50 \%$ , respectively. They assumed “others laughing at them” while practicing the FL at $3 9 \%$ , with $42 \%$ agreeing that their fellow learners may make fun of their public FL communication.

# 4.1.3 | TA

Appendix B in Data S1 presents the TA construct, which was inspected in items 8, 10, and 21. The results suggested that the participants' TA stabilized in the same upwards direction; however, more learners reported their lack of ease during tests: $6 9 \%$ as opposed to $4 6 \%$ agreed that they felt at ease during their tests pre- and post-intervention, with $23 \%$ pushed out of the sense of ease zone. Reiteratively, $1 1 \%$ compared to $2 9 \%$ reported their lack of ease during tests pre- and post-intervention. Item 10 explored the learners' increasing concern regarding “the consequences of failing their FL class,” with $6 8 \%$ and $62 \%$ approving of this statement pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Moreover, item 21 indicated identical patterns pre- and post-intervention, with $3 5 \%$ agreeing that “the more they study, the more they get confused.”

# 4.2 | RQ2: What is the role of AI-driven chatbots in FLA management?

The numerical datasets were compared quantitatively to identify any statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-intervention returns. Thereafter, the data were analysed linguistically to examine whether the intervention played any role in the learners' FLA. Table 2 indicates that the participants experienced certain anxiety levels pre-intervention, with $4 6 \%$ of responses agreeing with the FLCAS statements, reporting certain levels of anxiety. However, the post-intervention responses marked even higher levels of anxiety, at $51 \%$ . Furthermore, Table 2 indicates that the agreement central tendency was higher in the post-intervention with a mean of 15.3 and 16.8 pre- and post-intervention, respectively. The respondents who were indifferent to the FLCAS statements decreased from $1 6 \%$ to $14 \%$ , with means of 5.1 and 4.8 pre- andpost-intervention, respectively. The difference between the respondent rejection levels of the anxiety expressions was reduced from $3 7 \%$ preintervention to $3 5 \%$ post-intervention, with means of 12.6 and 11.4, respectively. These results indicate that learners experienced higher level of recognized FLA levels post-intervention with a mean difference of $- 3 . 7 3$ (see Table 3). Therefore, the learners' FLA increased slightly. The learners' engagement with these AI applications played a minimal role in their FLA; in fact, it was slightly sharpened.

Table 3 presents an analysis of the FLCAS non-parametric data. The Wilcoxon test was used to examine whether any statistical significance existed between the pre- and post-intervention frequencies. Table 3 indicates that the mean difference between the pre- and post-intervention was $- 3 . 7 3$ . Regarding the respondents' agreement with the FLCAS, the difference between the pre- and post-intervention was significant at a $p$ -value of 0.05, with a Z-value of $- 1 . 9 8 8$ based on the negative ranks. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that the participant postintervention anxiety levels were higher than those pre-intervention $( Z = - 1 . 9 8 8$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ ) (statistically significant). There was a negative difference between the pre- and post-intervention, validating the finding that the AI-driven applications may have exacerbated the learner anxiety to an extent.

Note: Bold values indicates statistically significance $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ .

The three FLA constructs were qualitatively investigated to capture the changes in the FLCAS pre- and post-intervention.

# 4.2.1 | CA

The responses to items 3, 4, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20, 25, and 33 demonstrated that the participants experienced some cognitive and somatic manifestations of FLA (see Appendix B in Data S1). They endured mixed levels of negative emotions such as reduced self-confidence at $44 \%$ and $5 5 \%$ , panic at $5 8 \%$ and $71 \%$ , embarrassment with a stable $42 \%$ , anxiety at $5 5 \%$ and $56 \%$ , tenseness at $1 6 \%$ and $45 \%$ , and fear of being patronized with $3 9 \%$ and $42 \%$ in the pre- and post-intervention, respectively (see Appendix B in Data S1). It appears that the intervention exacerbated their anxieties owing to the additional challenges. Numerous learners developed limited tolerance of ambiguity, as reported in items 15 and 29, at $4 7 \%$ and $5 5 \%$ and at $3 9 \%$ and $5 8 \%$ pre- and post-intervention, respectively. These applications may not have responded interactively to the learner needs with diversified topics that would allow them to converse flexibly.

# 4.2.2 | FNE

The learners did not perform any better on the FNE, which was heightened following the intervention. The learners retained their predetermined fear of FL public performance, assuming potential ridicule from interlocutors, as indicated by items 13, 16, 19, and 31. Their use of the AI applications may have heightened their sensitivity to the typological distance between their L1 and FL, bringing accuracy rather than fluency to their attention to assume greater control over the situation. They may have been alarmed that these AI applications could not recognize their mispronounced words or poorly-formed sentence structures, thus focusing on accuracy, even though they had to practise with non-judgemental technologies. It appears that they harboured the misconception that they had to be hyper-accurate to be intelligible.

# 4.2.3 | TA

The learners' TA was also marginally intensified following the intervention. The learners' engagement with AI applications may have challenged them by accumulating their technological limitations to their perceived linguistic incompetence in a test taking situation. Fear of failure, cramming before exams, poor performance, or ineffective studying habits appear to be robust reasons that could not easily be shaken by the use of transient AI applications. However, a limited level of TA appears to be essential to encourage learners to prepare for exams and adopt effective studying habits to ensure improved FL results.

# 4.3 | RQ3: What is the role of AI-driven chatbots in FL speaking?

Table 4 presents the total scores of the participants' speaking roleplays were computed and a paired-sample t-test was used to compare the pre test and posttest performances. Statistical analyses were run with SPSS version 26. The effect size was medium, computed at $( d ~ = ~ 0 . 5 )$ (Cohen, 1988), with a desired statistical power of 0.77. Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics, including the sample sizes, means of the pretest and posttest scores, modes, variances, medians, SDs, and standard error means, which were all recorded and compared to identify any statistically significant differences.

Table 4 illustrates that there was a significant difference between the total scores of the oral pretest (total $= 2 6 3$ , $\mathsf { M } = 5 . 4$ , ${ \mathsf { S } } { \mathsf { D } } = 1 . 0 )$ and posttest (total $= 3 8 2$ , $\mathsf { M } = 8 . 0$ , ${ \mathsf { S D } } = 1 . 1$ ) conditions (t (47), $p \leq 0 . 0 5 _ { \cdot }$ ). The alpha level that was selected for the statistical tests was 0.05. The $\%$ of vari ance was calculated at $+ 3 1 \%$ .

Table 5 indicates the paired-sample t-test that was applied, yielding a result of $- 1 1 . 1 3 < 0 . 0 5$ , which was statistically significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels. The mean of the learners' speaking IELTS scores was initially 5.4, which increased to 8.0 after the intervention (Table 4). These results suggested a statistically significant difference between the posttest and pretest speaking test scores. Tables 5 and 6 present the results of the paired-sample t-test ( $: ( 4 7 ) = - 1 1 . 1 3 , p > 0 . 0 5 )$ , suggesting that the learners' oral proficiency may have benefited from the intervention.

# 5 | DISCUSSION

This study explored the role of AI in speaking practice for FLA management and FL speaking ability in an EFL class. The independent variable was the AI application, whereas the two dependent variables were the FLA and FL speaking ability. The findings of RQ1 corroborated the research results whereby EFL learners suffer from certain FLA levels, particularly in speaking skills (Attia, 2015; Marcos-Llinás & Garau, 2009; Oflaz, 2019). The respondents experienced certain anxiety levels at similar percentages pre- and post-intervention. This may be attributed to the educational context of the study, which could compel the learners to worry about failing the course rather than promoting their FL. Their affective status may have been taxed with the high-stake influence of the academic context of the study. Furthermore, being part of a mixed-sex class in a maledominant culture may have triggered the learners' apprehension of being publicly exposed. Therefore, they may have inflicted stringent selfimposed measures on their self-image, which may have hindered their active participation in communicative activities (Teimouri et al., 2019). Another potential source of FLA is FNE. Although error correction is essential to FL learning, the manner and quality of the correction are vital to avoid a reduction in self-esteem, and thus, anxiety. These learners may have embraced a predetermined misconception that any error correction could place them in an inferior position before their fellow classmates, language-ego at stake. Moreover, the learners may have held a predetermined negative misconception regarding assessment tools, as learners are never educated about the assessment-as-learning goals of tests.

The RQ2 results indicated that the participant anxiety levels were not alleviated when employing non-threatening AI applications; in fact, the FLA increased slightly. This contrasts the literature that proposed that technology-driven applications positively impact learners' affect by engaging with non-judgemental applications (Bao, 2019; Dizon, 2020; Dodigovic, 2007; Lee, 2019; Tafazoli & Gómez-Parra, 2017). This finding may oppose the general research patterns because the research on technology-enhanced FL learning has always reported the overall positive effects, but the learners' actual outcomes were hardly examined (Zhang & Zou, 2020). Further, the affective variables often encompassed enjoyability, engagement, interest, motivation, confidence, and satisfaction, with hardly any research exclusively directed towards FLA (Lee, 2019).

Alternatively, this finding may be owing to the short duration of the intervention, which might not have secured the learners with sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the AI applications. Although hyper-connected young adults comfortably embrace technology-rich environments, they may have been challenged by the implicit/explicit meaning and form constraints. While interacting in a natural conversation, real-time teachers appear to maintain their reactive–proactive capacity to cater to learners' needs of shifting among topics, thereby swaying the conversation based on the learners' non-linguistic cues. However, the discernible human factor offers complex reasoning, adaptability, identification, support, and empathy in social interactions, which machines cannot provide at present. With this emotion deficit attribute, these AI applications may be the impetus for learners' motivation decay. Further AI-focused research should explore the refinement these technologies require to cater to learners' emotional needs.

Another interpretation could be that the learners were challenged because they assumed themselves as unintelligible to these applications or the applications were incomprehensible to them (Dizon, 2017). The majority of chatbots are reactive and hardly address goal-oriented dialogues (Bibauw et al., 2019), which may have deepened the participants' apprehension of being proactive and initiating conversation. They responded reactively based on the type of data, which may not have matched the learners' topical familiarity or interests. Despite having repeated conversations with the virtual partners, they retained their apprehension of being publicly exposed. These practice rounds may have benefited the learners' linguistic gains, but not their emotions.

The RQ3 results indicated a significant difference between the total scores of the oral pretest and posttest. It is possible that higher speaking scores were rendered because of the intervention, which may have encouraged the learners to expedite their FL output and practise meaningful social interactions (Brown, 2007; Ellis, 2005; Krashen, 1982). The learners may have experienced moderate anxiety levels with optimum positive effects on their performance by increasing their effort and activating their battery of strategies. Tafazoli and Gómez-Parra (2017) argued that using AI applications enhanced the student-centred learning approach rather than the teacher-centred approach, offering ample individualisation. These applications may have boosted the learners' linguistic efficacy in their public communication. Moreover, they may have triggered the vigilance of their linguistic precision and adeptness (Dizon, 2017). They may also have enhanced the learners' oral performance by sharpening their cognitive faculties and linguistic abilities, indicating that anxiety plays an underexplored facilitative role.

Counter to the literature (MacIntyre, 2017), FLA could have played a minor role in dividing the learners' attention from the required task. A manageable level of FLA interference is viewed as an essential facilitative factor in FL learning (Chastain, 1975; Hsu, 2017; Jahangiri, 2015; Marcos-Llinás & Garau, 2009; Scovel, 1978; Selvam et al., 2016). FLA may serve as an adaptive reaction that mobilizes an individual's cognitive capacity to defend, avoid, or even attack any external or internal anxiety triggers (Kráľová & Petrova, 2017). This contention undermines the tenet that FLA is correlated with FL learning problems (Horwitz, 2017; MacIntyre, 2017; MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991; Teimouri et al., 2019). The identified FLA level did not encourage the learners to allocate less attention to FL; in fact, they improved in their speaking posttest. Thus, manageable anxiety levels along with a permeable FL learning psychological profile are paramount for improved FL outcomes, rendering greater alertness and a strengthened memory (Hsu, 2017). Hsu (2017) contended that certain levels of learning anxiety and mental effort played a facilitative role in engaging in augmented reality-enhanced instructional games. These findings corroborate the research in which AI chatbots potentially improved the learners' FL speaking gains (Golonka et al., 2014; Hsu, 2017). Alternative explanations for these findings might be that the learners matured, that this is the testing effect, or that they may have been captured by the novelty effect. These alternatives were discounted as interpretations because while some participants benefited from the intervention, others did not.

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

FL contexts should leverage manageable anxiety levels to motivate learners to expend the required effort, thereby evoking problem-solving techniques and activating strategic competence, rather than provoking inhibitive anxiety. AI applications have a potential favourable impact on FL learning outcomes, and thus, educators, designers, and FL stakeholders should integrate them astutely in FL classrooms to optimize learning gains. This study contributes to the literature on FL acquisition by empirically examining the facilitative dimension of FLA in speaking. The author– researcher has devised an additional criterion to the public IELTS speaking evaluation rubric to evaluate communication and interaction, which the IELTS rubric does not capture. The significance of this study lies in its pedagogical implications, particularly for learners from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Foreign language teachers should exploit the facilitative role of FLA in their classrooms while constructively steering their learners' affective condition. They should also analyse their learners' affective profile, including their anxiety levels, to be able to manage the FLA to a manageable level that does not interfere with FL learning. Similarly, instructional material writers may benefit from integrating AI-driven applications to support their learners' gains particularly in speaking. In light of the interactionist approach, FL material designers should leverage the proposed synergy of textual and auditory chatbots (the intervention design) to promote focus on form and negotiation of meaning which has significantly improved learners' speaking skills. These findings should benefit AI system designers on the required training for their prospective AI systems to offer learners meaningful opportunities for TL model and practice (see Appendix A in Data S1). With natural-like interaction frames (a constructive interactive communicative model), these applications may help breaking the mould of relying mostly and solely on textbooks focusing on competence and performance. It offers empirical data on a practical solution, a pedagogical framework, which can enhance traditional FL instruction in impoverished FL contexts where there is scarcity of TL model and practice.

This study exhibits certain limitations, such as its potential experimental bias, lack of a control group, small sample size, and substantial descriptive data. This potential bias was counteracted by consulting an expert in the field besides the two volunteering participants to examine the identified patterns to alleviate potential bias in the results. Numerical data were also employed to substantiate findings drawn from the qualitative data. Using mixed method design provides a better understanding of the phenomenon of interest. Although the sample size was small due to limited resources, it was information rich where the respondents provided some in-depth information reflecting on their personal experience with the chatbots. The findings can only be generalized to other populations under similar conditions owing to the small sample size. Further research would benefit from recruiting a larger sample size and generating qualitative data using prompted reflective weekly diaries. The attrition of 10 participants is another caveat this research suffered from.

Further empirical research should identify the exact anxiety level that may be permeable to FL learning. Future research should seek pedagogy-informed longitudinal large-scale studies to investigate other AI-driven applications in varying linguistic and cultural contexts. Scholars should empirically examine AI technologies in diversified contexts using long-term studies to identify learners' FL outcomes. Moreover, other geographically diversified areas could be explored by examining learners' emerging identities in highly interactive environments.
