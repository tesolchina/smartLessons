# ABSTRACT

The use of text chat in synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) could help remedy the widely reported lack of active involvement in online language learning. However, the nuances and complexities of learners’ text-chat actions warrant further examination. This exploratory study used observational data collected from 40 students in a graduate-level Academic English course at eight time points across a semester to analyze the functions of text-chat interaction in an SCMC setting and to capture how their text chat changed over time. This led to the identification of five functions of text-chat interaction (i.e. cognition, metacognition, socio-affect, organization, and technology), suggesting that cognitively meaningful learning occurred immediately through such interaction. Over time, there was a decline in the quantity of text-chat interactions. In addition, the patterns of chat between students and the teacher were somewhat different from those observed among students. In the former case, text quantity diminished, especially in the category of cognition; but in the latter, students engaged in more text chat with their peers to show affect, cognitive agreement, and disagreement over time. The study’s findings regarding the complex dynamics of an authentic process in SCMC language classrooms have considerable practical value in facilitating interaction in similar language-learning contexts.

# 1.  Introduction

Perhaps the most enduring challenge for online language learners is a lack of interaction with their teachers and/or peers (e.g. Author, 2020;

Cheung, 2021a; Harsch et  al., 2021; Lin et  al., 2016; Maican & Cocoradă, 2021; Moorhouse et  al., 2021; Zou et  al., 2021), despite interaction playing a pivotal role in language learning (e.g. Lantolf & Thorne, 2007; Long, 1996; Walsh, 2006; Warschauer, 1997). To some degree, synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) (Hoffman, 2018; Kim, 2012; Lin & Gao, 2020), especially the use of text chat that supplements audio and visual interaction (Côté & Gaffney, 2018; Vu & Fadde, 2013; Wang & Chen, 2009; Wigham & Chanier, 2015), could remedy the lack of such active involvement in learning. This may be because it allows students not only to make content-related contributions, but also to feel a strong sense of co-presence with their classmates, while experiencing rapid information delivery (Bower et  al., 2015). However, the functions that text-chat interaction plays in online language learning warrant further examination, aimed at developing a clearer understanding of the interaction patterns during such learning (Cheung, 2021b; Peeters, 2018; Sato & Ballinger, 2016; Shi & Stickler, 2018; White et  al., 2020). Moreover, the establishment and sustainment of such learning experiences (Gacs et  al., 2020) calls for more research into evolving patterns of interaction, which can only be carried out through data collection and analysis at different time points (Peeters, 2019; Zheng & Warschauer, 2015). We believe that analyzing changes in data over time could capture the nuances and complexities of learners’ actions in online language learning, rather than simply producing hard-to-interpret research snapshots of single time-points (Jung et  al., 2019; White et  al., 2020). The answers to the above two concerns are expected not only to inform new instructional designs and teaching approaches that are better suited to SCMC (Cheung, 2021b; Vu & Fadde, 2013), but also to enlighten teaching and learning in broader, sustained online language-learning contexts beyond SCMC (Maican & Cocoradă, 2021; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2021).

Accordingly, this exploratory study was designed to capture English-language learners’ text-chat interaction in an SCMC context, and used a content-analysis approach to identify the functions that text-chat interaction fulfilled. Additionally, changes in the participants’ patterns of interaction were studied across a semester, both holistically, and broken down into teacher-student and student-student interaction.

# 2.1.  Language teaching and learning in SCMC

SCMC is one of the two major modes of delivering computer-assisted language learning (CALL), the other being asynchronous computer-mediated communication (Jonassen et  al., 1995). Early SCMC studies mainly focused on the use of text chat in online learning, and demonstrated the efficiency of SCMC instruction (e.g. Smith, 2003). In SCMC language classrooms in recent years, learners and their teachers have tended to be co-present in shared virtual networks, in which they converse mainly through various combinations of text chat, audioconferencing, videoconferencing, interactive whiteboards, instant polling, webcams, virtual subgroups, and emoticons (e.g. Jung et  al., 2019; Martin & Alvarez Valdivia, 2017; O’Rourke & Stickler, 2017; Wang & Chen, 2009; Zeng, 2017). Some recent studies have reported that second-language (L2) teachers are using new SCMC tools that are more innovative, interactive, user-friendly, and direct than others used in the recent past (e.g. Gruber & Bauer, 2020; Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022; Ma, 2020). Generally, SCMC has been considered an effective means of enhancing online language learning. Learners in SCMC settings exhibit less anxiety and more motivation; respond to others in a more timely fashion; are more likely to follow turn-taking rules; give greater consideration to their conversations’ social and affective functions; and generate more cognitive meaning than their counterparts in face-to-face classrooms (e.g. Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022; Maican & Cocoradă, 2021; Murphy, 2010; Peeters, 2018). In a recent study by Harsch et  al. (2021), when students and teachers were asked about ways to improve the quality of online learning, ‘using synchronous activities’ was the top suggestion from both groups.

However, the SCMC context also poses distinctive challenges. For instance, research by Ma (2020) reported that Chinese EFL students had a hard time focusing on and maintaining learning interest in SCMC, the major reasons for this being feelings of loneliness and lack of timely feedback. Lin and Gao (2020), meanwhile, found that online learners taking synchronous L2 classes complained about inactive students who never participated, deeming them a distraction from learning. Kohnke and Moorhouse (2022) noted a similar issue, and pointed out that students often became less willing to participate in synchronous whole-class sessions due to a lack of paralinguistic cues. Another study from an EFL teacher’s perspective (Cheung, 2021a) similarly reported a restricted chance for interaction when using an SCMC platform. So, rather than simply being optimistic about the advantages of SCMC for language learning (Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022), there is an ever-present need to ensure that SCMC learning environments remain collaborative, interactive, and supportive (Belda-Medina, 2021; Cheung, 2021b; Zeng, 2017).

# 2.2.  Text chat in SCMC language-classroom interaction

L2 acquisition research grounded in sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978) has highlighted the nature of learners and their environments (Ellis, 2000; Warschauer, 1997). As Hampel (2006) noted, language learning arises ‘not through but in interaction’ (p. 109). In other words, it is during socially mediated collaboration that language learning takes place (Long, 1996; White et  al., 2020; Zeng, 2017). Moreover, the positive effects of such interaction can be maximized when it generates meaningful, shared outputs, such as written work (Lantolf & Thorne, 2007; Peeters & Pretorius, 2020), and a prominent mode of such work is real-time text chat (Hampel, 2006; Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022; Moorhouse et  al., 2021; Wang & Chen, 2009). From a sociocultural perspective, such chat not only reflects the interactional function of language, which can facilitate the construction of meaning, but also functions as a thinking device, highlighting the reflective nature of language (Payne, 2020; Warschauer, 1997). For these reasons, using text chat has been identified as a primary means of providing engaging and interactive synchronous lessons (Peachey, 2017). Considered as a supplementary tool to the audio and video functions in an SCMC classroom (Wang & Chen, 2009), it should be inserted into teaching plans following a low to high cognitive sequence (Moorhouse et  al., 2021; Payne, 2020).

Many previous CALL studies have suggested that text chat has five key characteristics. First, it increases learner participation and generates more turn-taking (Côté & Gaffney, 2018), with Cheung (2021b) arguing that text chat maximizes class participation by providing equal chances for learners to make contributions to synchronous discussions without being interrupted by peers. Second, it encompasses aspects of both speaking (i.e. real-time communication) and writing (i.e. reflection and revision) (Côté & Gaffney, 2018). Third, it allows learners to spend more time processing (Ziegler, 2016) and to focus on the cognitive use of language, which may stimulate further interaction (Kern et  al., 2004). Fourth, it increases learners’ noticing of target-language traits and enables them to become more aware of their learning gaps (Wang & Chen, 2009; Ziegler et  al., 2020); and lastly, it serves as a channel for learners and teachers to socialize and provide support to one another (Chen et al., 2009).

It is believed that text chat could become especially helpful in facilitating interaction in SCMC classrooms. The EFL teacher that Cheung (2021b) observed explicitly asked his students to make extensive use of the chatroom function in Zoom, by participating at least nine times per class via text chat. The same teacher was also reported to have skillfully solicited both verbal and text-chat responses from his class when posing questions. The author made a comparison between this teacher and another EFL teacher observed in a previous study (Cheung, 2021a), who felt that teaching on Zoom was like ‘talking to the air’ (p. 10). Such a feeling could be largely attributed to that teacher’s practice of muting all her students during SCMC sessions, in effect turning the class into a monologue, and taking little or no advantage of Zoom’s text-chat functions. Belda-Medina (2021), meanwhile, found that synchronous text in a chat box played a crucial part in keeping class interaction alive, over and above the use of video and audio. Similarly, in a study by Kohnke and Jarvis (2021), nine out of 17 English for Academic Purposes teachers reported that their students felt more confident when using the chat function in Zoom to express their ideas, especially when they were reluctant to turn on their speakers or cameras.

A closer look at the above studies, however, indicates that most focused on either proposing text chat as one of several potential ways to enhance interaction (Belda-Medina, 2021; Kohnke & Jarvis, 2021; Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022; Moorhouse et al., 2021; Wang & Chen, 2009), or studying the benefits of real-time text chat in language learning (e.g. Chen et  al., 2009; Côté & Gaffney, 2018; Kern et  al., 2004; Kessler et  al., 2020). Moreover, almost all of them treated text chat as essentially monolithic, without exploring the variety of functions that it could fulfill (the key exception being Cheung, 2021b). Thus, it is still unclear how interaction via text chat occurs in the SCMC context. In the absence of a thorough and nuanced understanding of the nature of text chat in that context, it is no wonder that, despite the chat function’s clear status as ‘a positive development’, the ‘distraction’ caused by the need to continuously monitor it ‘was reported as a negative consequence’ (Kohnke & Jarvis, 2021, p. 6). Cheung (2021b), in possibly the only prior study to explicitly discuss the multiple functions of text chat in SCMC classrooms, found that it helped to boost the quantity of initial learner responses to questions, but that it could not lead to final knowledge acquisition. In any case, to assume that text chat functions merely as an information trigger is to focus disproportionately on the cognitive process (Kim, 2012), and to neglect its other potential roles, such as providing social cues or aiding the development of metacognitive knowledge. Moreover, even within its cognitive function, text chat may play roles other than as a trigger. This is because its effectiveness is closely related to whether and to what degree a teacher takes advantage of it (e.g. Cheung, 2021a; Harsch et  al., 2021; Kohnke & Jarvis, 2021; Moorhouse et  al., 2021). Perhaps more importantly, from a social-constructivist perspective, students’ knowledge-construction process occurs when they try to create meaning in and through their surroundings (Jonassen et  al., 1995). During this meaning-making process, dialogue serves as the primary instrument, as it fulfills functions such as triggering, explaining, clarifying, elaborating, judging, questioning, supporting, defending, reflecting, and so forth (e.g. Garrison et  al., 2000); and these functions can become even stronger when the dialogue is carried out in written form (Pena-Shaff et  al., 2001). If we extend this idea to the use of text chat in SCMC,

it is reasonable to assume that such chat plays multiple roles that could include any or all of the component functions of meaning-making, in a cycle of practical inquiry that should include understanding, exploration, integration and application (Garrison et  al., 2000).

The above idea gains further support from prior examinations of the functions that text chat plays in asynchronous language learning. Peeters (2018) proposed a model to illustrate the nature and categories of asynchronous text chat when using Web 2.0 technology. At the center of this model is the purpose of fostering peer interaction for language learning, which is enacted through four distinctive functions: cognition, metacognition, organization, and socio-affect. In developing cognition, learners were found to use text chat to compose text, make meaning, and revise written output, in what the author regarded as a process of ‘producing, revising and adapting linguistic output’ (p. 922). Peeters’s examples of socio-affect included, among others, acknowledging others’ contributions and showing gratitude; of organization, discussing assignment and exam requirements; and of metacognition, identifying needs, setting goals, and reflecting on the learning process.

Indeed, many of the functions identified by Peeters (2018) in an asynchronous setting were implied in some recent SCMC studies, albeit rarely and obliquely. For example, Wang and Chen (2009) and Strawbridge (2021) found that text chat served the process of negotiating meaning, while Moorhouse et  al. (2021) and Ziegler et  al. (2020) reported that it facilitated recasts and metalinguistic feedback among peers. Other studies have noted that it helped students to raise questions without interrupting the whole class (e.g. Kohnke & Jarvis, 2021) and to establish social presence (Lin & Gao, 2020), especially when they used it to hold off-topic conversations aimed at receiving or providing emotional support (Chen et  al., 2009). It has also been argued that the chat function in SCMC should be put to greater use in organizing classes, to offset the lack of physical presence in online learning (Moorhouse et  al., 2021). Although metacognition has not been directly studied in SCMC text-chat research, previous findings do reveal relatively poor self-discipline, self-direction and time management among SCMC learners (e.g. Chen et  al., 2009; Zou et  al., 2021), implying that future interventions via text chat could be useful. Putting all these pieces together, it is evident that a comprehensive and systematic investigation of the functions that text-chat interaction plays in SCMC language classrooms is warranted.

# 2.3.  Interaction patterns in SCMC text chat

It would also seem worthwhile to investigate developmental trends in SCMC text chat over time, given that sequencing has been seen as playing a crucial role in patterns of change in online discussion (Chen et  al., 2009). For example, Zheng and Warschauer (2015) study of an asynchronous discussion forum found that, as time went on, more posts were made by students and fewer by the teacher, indicating a shift from a teacher-centered network to a student-centered one. Interestingly, a number of studies have indicated that, amid increases in the quantity of posts over time, their quality deteriorated. For example, Guan et  al. (2006) found that the proportion of off-topic texts increased. Similarly, Yang et  al. (2015) reported that students posted more irrelevant topics in week three of a course than in its first two weeks, and that such off-topic conversation fell into a repetitive cycle. And, in a synchronous class, Chen et  al. (2009) observed that the third discussion period included fewer cognitive and metacognitive messages than the first two. Based on such findings, it would seem worthwhile, on an exploratory basis, to examine how text-chat use in SCMC language classrooms develops through time, as doing so may enable us to understand the nuances and complexity of what is happening in online language classrooms (Jung et  al., 2019; White et  al., 2020) and to make pedagogical interventions accordingly (Guan et  al., 2006; Yang et  al., 2015).

When evaluating such change, it is important to understand the structures, characteristics, and patterns of interaction (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). Usefully, previous literature measured 1) group density, i.e. how well members of a network are interconnected with one another; 2) group reciprocity, i.e. how likely such members are to be mutually connected; and 3) centrality, i.e. the numbers of interactions that a member initiates or is the target of (e.g. Peeters, 2019; Peeters & Pretorius, 2020; Shi & Stickler, 2018). Other studies have used visual methods to demonstrate the interrelationships of English learners interacting online (Sumi, 2011; Zheng & Warschauer, 2015). Another more direct approach is to count the frequencies of different types of interaction (Peeters, 2018). It is also worth noting that, in a synchronous online classroom, students interact with both the teacher and their peers. To build on previous literature, it will therefore be necessary to treat the observed network both as an integral part and broken down into different types of interaction, i.e. teacher-student interaction, and student-student interaction.

Our research questions are as follows:

1. What functions did English-language learners’ text chat perform during interaction in an SCMC context?   
2. How did the pattern of text-based interaction evolve over time, a) in general, b) at the level of teacher-student interaction, and c) at the level of student-student interaction?

# 3.  Methods

# 3.1.  Research context

This exploratory study was carried out at a large research and teaching university in China, in a graduate-level Academic English course that used a videoconferencing tool, Tencent Meeting, as its synchronous online-learning platform. The course lasted eight weeks, during each of which the students met online for two 90-minute sessions. In each 90-minute period of synchronous class time, students logged in to Tencent to attend the lectures and interact with the teacher and their peers. We selected the first 90-minute session from the first through eighth (i.e. final) weeks for analysis. Our reason for focusing on first sessions was that the second sessions focused more on students’ groupwork presentations, and involved relatively scant teacher participation. To assist our aim of exploring change over time, we chose to separate the eight collected sessions into two phases: the first half of the semester (i.e. Weeks 1–4) and the second half (Weeks 5–8).

The course comprised the following eight units: An introduction to academic English, Abstracts, Introductions, Literature reviews, Methodology sections, Results sections, Discussions, and Conclusions. The structure of the selected course was quite consistent throughout the semester, rendering the first sessions of each of these units highly comparable. In each case, the teacher began by checking the network, then spent five minutes conducting pop-up quizzes and another five on students’ mini presentations. Then, she provided a summary of the learning content from the previous week; and, during the remaining class time, delivered the course material in a question-and-answer format. That is, all questions and discussions were initiated by the teacher as she lectured based on slides. The students were free to use text chat to answer the questions she asked, and were also encouraged to use such chat to ask their own questions or post comments. The number of slides in each of the eight sessions was quite consistent, i.e. about 25.

Figure 1 is an example of a typical class slide and how students used text chat to answer the teacher’s questions. While lecturing about citation styles, the teacher first asked about the students’ understanding of citation styles. The first three text-chat comments in the right-hand chat box in the screenshot are students’ replies, in which they provided their own understandings of what different citation styles mean. The teacher provided further elaboration on the course content based on these student replies, and asked whether the class had understood. One student posted that she did understand. After that, the teacher encouraged the students to think about what other scenarios worked best for author-prominent citation, and one posted ‘if the author is authoritative, maybe we can use Author Prominent’ as a response to the teacher’s question. Overall, this question-and-answer pattern during the lecture portion of each session was quite stable throughout the semester. Also, it should be noted that at all points in the semester, the main channel whereby the teacher communicated with students was audio, as her microphone was on almost all the time. The most common way for students to interact with either the instructor or their peers, on the other hand, was via synchronous text chat in the videoconferencing software. The teacher used English to teach the course, and also required students to reply in English. Almost all the text-chat posts by students were written in English, although in some very rare cases when students expressed their feelings, they chose to use Chinese (for an example, see Table 1).

All 40 students who were enrolled in the target course consented to participate in this study. Most $( 7 2 . 5 \%$ , ${ \bf n } = 2 9$ ) were male, and their average age was 25.28 ( $S D = 1 . 9 3 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ . Their majors included hydraulic engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, computer science, chemistry, and literature, among others, with 29 being in STEM-related disciplines and the remaining 11 in the arts and humanities. Five were third-year doctoral students, and the rest, second-year doctoral students. Just over a third of the participants $( \mathtt { n } = 1 4 )$ ) had some previous experience of SCMC classes.

# 3.3.2.  Text chat

During the synchronous sessions, students’ chat-box posts included, but were not limited to, answers to the teacher’s questions, posing their own questions, reporting technical issues, and indicating agreement.

# 3.4.  Data analysis

Content analysis was applied to answer our first research question. In all, the students’ real-time text chat comprised 909 posts for data analysis, which for coding purposes were broken down into conversational turns. In the first phase of the coding process, following the recommendations of Peeters (2018) and Pena-Shaff et  al. (2001), the lead author read through all transcripts and classified each text-chat post as fulfilling one or more of four broad functions identified based on our review of the prior literature—i.e. cognition, technology, organization, and socio-affect—and 36 sub-codes. Then, the first and second authors used the coding schema arrived at in the first phase to code one week’s class session randomly selected from among the eight, and exchanged their coding results. Both coders then discussed the meaning, scope, and indicators of each code. Based on that discussion, the lead author revised the schema, mainly by (1) further differentiating among the cognition-related codes; and (2) reducing the number of sub-codes for socio-affect, by combining some of them. This resulted in a net decrease in the number of sub-codes from 36 to 28. In the next phase, both researchers coded another randomly chosen transcript independently and exchanged their results. The ensuing discussion resulted in some further revisions to the coding schema, mainly for the sake of clarity. For example, the two coders decided that stating ideas and explaining ideas, which had been deemed separate by Pena-Shaff et  al. (2001), should be combined due to the difficulty of distinguishing between them in our data. Both coders also agreed to add a new function, assertion, to reflect how students defended their own arguments by making further assertions. In the final phase, the coders decided to use the version of coding schema arrived at during the previous phase as their baseline schema for recoding of the remaining five transcripts. This process also involved further checks for agreement, disagreement, and errors, as well as the calculation of inter-rater reliability. The average Cohen’s kappa value was .84. Lastly, all disagreements were discussed between the coders until final consensus was reached.

To answer our second research question regarding changes in patterns of text-chat interaction over time, we utilized social network analysis (SNA, Haythornthwaite, 1996; Hoppe & Reinelt, 2010). This involved, firstly, generating two different sociograms to obtain a visual understanding of the interactions that occurred in the synchronized classrooms in our two four-week time periods. We then calculated group cohesion using indices including group density (i.e. the proportion of existing edges to all possible edges, to show how well the network’s nodes are interconnected) and group reciprocity (i.e. the likelihood of nodes being mutually connected). We also tested degree centrality using two indicators: outdegree centrality (i.e. the total amount of edges that a node sends) and indegree centrality (i.e. the total amount of edges that a node receives). All SNA analyses were conducted with the R package iGraph. In addition, we calculated and compared the frequencies of each code in the two time periods.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  Functions of learners’ text-chat interaction

Five functions comprising 28 codes emerged from the 909 coded posts (see Table 1). Each function is described in its own subsection below.

# 4.1.1.  Cognition

The cognition function, which accounted for $5 7 . 2 \%$ of all student-generated comments, can be identified in posts that aim to facilitate knowledge construction at a cognitive level. It includes seven sub-functions: assertion, clarification, discussing questions, showing understanding, disagreement, agreement, and judgment. The first, assertion $\left( \mathrm { n } = 6 \right)$ , refers to students’ posts that defended or re-stated their previously articulated ideas or assumptions. For instance, after student ID6 finished making a presentation, student ID26 asked about the use of grammar in one of the slides (‘Can ‘Which’ refer to the whole sentence?’). After this objection by ID26, two other students posted similar objections. ID26 then added: ‘But my high school teacher taught me to use ‘Which’ to refer to the whole sentence QAQ’, i.e. explicitly restated her argument by reference to what she had learned in an earlier phase of her education. She also used the Asian emoticon QAQ, which serves a similar function to ‘crying face’: ‘(, presumably to soften the tone of her comments.

The second sub-function, clarification, was the main way that the students interacted with their teacher and peers at a cognitive level $\mathrm { { \acute { n } = 3 7 4 } } )$ . We further identified eight indicators within this sub-function: describing personal experience, language-related text analysis, language-related grammar, language-related vocabulary, providing outside resources, stating assumptions, stating facts, and stating/explaining ideas. Around $9 3 \%$ of this sub-function was represented by four indicators, i.e. using text chat to state an idea in response to a teacher’s question $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 8 8 \mathrm { \ell }$ ); and answering the teacher’s questions related to text-based analysis $\left( \mathrm { n } = 7 8 \right)$ , grammar $\left( \mathrm { n } = 7 8 \right)$ ), and vocabulary $( \mathtt { n } = 1 0 5 )$ ). This reflects the strong emphasis on specific usage of academic English by teacher and students alike.

The third sub-function, discussing questions, refers to the 21 occasions on which students spontaneously raised questions. Most were about conducting research (e.g. ‘Why is an approach in which individuals are interviewed personally considered ‘qualitative’?’, ‘Are citations needed in the introduction?’, ‘Does neglecting some negative data constitute academic misconduct?’), while the rest involved the linguistic use of academic English vocabulary (e.g. ‘Is datum a singular form of data?’), grammar (e.g. ‘Shall we use ‘is’ or ‘was’?’), and punctuation (e.g. ‘Is this comma necessary?’).

The fourth sub-function in the cognition category, showing understanding of the content $( \mathtt { n } = 4 2 )$ ), generally took forms like ‘Yes’ or ‘No problem’ as a short response to the teacher’s regular checking on whether students understood the learning content. This usually took place when the teacher finished clarifying a specific and difficult vocabulary or grammar problem, and asked ‘Have I made myself clear?’ or ‘Do you understand now?’ as a signal to elicit students’ feedback. To make sure students really understood the content, the teacher also frequently told them that they were free to answer $\mathrm { \mathop { N o } } ^ { \mathrm { \prime } }$ to such questions, and to express their confusion at any time.

The fifth through seventh sub-functions—disagreement, agreement, and judgment—all reflected students’ higher-level meaning-making processes. In disagreement, students either expressed their different opinions in a gentle way, by just typing different answers $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 5 \right)$ ), or more explicitly $\left( \mathrm { n } = 1 1 \right)$ ), e.g. by saying ‘Can’t WHICH refer to the whole sentence?’ In agreement $\left( \mathrm { n } = 2 5 \right)$ ), students typed in ‘yes,’ ‘yeah’, or $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ agree’ to endorse others’ inputs. And in judgment $\left( \mathrm { n } = 6 \right)$ , students made evaluations and criticisms of the learning content spontaneously: for example, ‘the writing style of this paper is quite different from the other one’, and ‘surprising result $\textcircled { a } \mathrm { I D } 2 6$ ’.

# 4.1.2.  Metacognition

The students’ text chat also revealed their metacognitive awareness, and in particular, their ability to reflect upon their emotions $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 \right)$ and their learning $( \mathtt { n } = 1 0 )$ . One example of the former was ‘公开处刑TAT’, literally meaning ‘public execution’ plus the Asian emoticon TAT that indicates a crying face. An example of reflection on learning was, ‘Aha, it turns out to be emulsification! I didn’t get it until now’. Another, which occurred after a student finished presenting, was ‘I copied it wrong. It should be “on the other hand,” not “on the one hand”’ as self-reflection about an error in his slides.

# 4.1.3.  Organization

Students had a chance to express their functional agreement, and make inquiries about learning tasks. Expressions of functional agreement $\mathbf { \tilde { n } = 1 1 7 } ,$ ) mostly occurred in the context of managing the pace of learning, such as when the teacher asked the entire class ‘Shall we move on?’ and the students would type ‘Yes’ or ‘OK’. Students also used text chat to ask questions about assignments or other in-class learning tasks $\left( \mathrm { n } = 1 4 \right)$ , and in some rare situations, to remind the teacher about upcoming assignments $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 \right)$ .

# 4.1.4.  Socio-affect

Our data suggested that the students supported each other and established social ties in three ways. The first $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 \right)$ was expressing their gratitude to peers and the second $[ \mathrm { n } = 1 0 6 )$ ) was expressing their gratitude to the teacher, especially at the end of a class session. Lastly, small talk $( \mathtt { n } = 1 9 )$ appeared sporadically during formal class sessions, and mainly involved discussion of celebrities or TV shows that were felt to relate to the teaching content in some way.

# 4.1.5.  Technology

The final text-chat function, technology, involved checking whether the videoconferencing software was working well and reporting any technical issues. The teacher usually started a class session by asking whether the technology was running smoothly, and multiple students typically responded. If a new technical issue emerged later in a class session, various students chose to use the chat box to inform the teacher. Some also offered potential solutions to such problems to the teacher or other students.

# 4.2.  Change in patterns of text-chat interaction over time

First, to understand the general outline of how patterns of text-chat interaction in the focal course changed over time, we compared the sociogram of the first four sessions against that of sessions 5 through 8 (Figures 2 and 3). The changes in their edge widths revealed a decline in the quantity of text-chat interactions. However, at the same time, the proportion of such interactions that were student-student rather than teacher-student increased, as shown by the second-half sociogram’s greater number of edges between pairs of nodes. The emergence of more, larger yellow dots between the first and second time periods, meanwhile, indicated that a wider range of students were becoming active (or more active) in posting and responding to text chat.

The above findings regarding a declining tendency in the quantity of text-chat interaction and an increasing tendency for such interaction to occur among students might seem contradictory at first sight. To better understand these two trends, we calculated network cohesion for each of the two time periods (see Table 2). At the node level, both periods saw 36 students involved in interaction, either as information senders or receivers, although the silent students were not always the same (i.e. the only student who was silent in both periods was ID3). At the edge level, there was a decline in the total number of connections in class, as the number of edges in the semester’s first half was 510, and in its second half, 441. Edges per node also dropped from 13.78 to 11.92, and reciprocity dropped from .09 to .07. Regarding density of the network, the number increased from .05 to .33, suggesting greater interconnectedness among class members.

As well as network cohesion, we checked network outdegree centrality and indegree centrality. This revealed a decline in students’ average outdegree centrality (i.e. from 14.17 to 12.25), indicating that fewer text-chat posts were emitted in the second half of the semester. Regarding indegree centrality, the teacher’s indegree index decreased from 474 to 346, but the students’ average indegree centrality increased from 1 to 2.64. This suggested that the teacher received less feedback from students over time, but at the same time, students received more text-chat communication from their peers.

The overall decline the total number of students’ text-chat interactions was mainly ascribable to fewer being directed toward the teacher (as evidenced by the decrease in teacher indegree and student average outdegree).

To see how the above-mentioned changes in text chat related to its identified functions, we first examined changes in the number of occurrences of each function being used (see Figure 4). Cognition exhibited the sharpest decline, from 316 to 204. Technology, in contrast, showed a $2 1 \%$ increase, from 52 to 63, albeit mainly because the teacher’s microphone was working poorly for several minutes in Week 7. Another increase occurred in organization, in which agreement and querying about assignments drove such growth. The other two text-chat functions, metacognition and socio-affect, exhibited little change.

Figure 4. Change over time by function.

To better understand the nuances of such change, especially in light of our finding that the changes in patterns of student-teacher and student-student interaction did not take place hand in hand, we divided our data on each function into two subsets, according to whether it had occurred as part of student-teacher or student-student interaction (Table 3). Separate examination of each subset revealed, in the case of student-teacher interaction, 1) that all functions apart from technology and organization decreased over time: from 292 to 153 in cognition, seven to four in metacognition and 62 to 54 in socio-affect; 2) that five cognitive sub-functions exhibited sharp declines, i.e. grammar (from 52 to 21), vocabulary (from 64 to 38), stating/explaining ideas (from 43 to 24), presenting a different idea (from 21 to 10), and showing understanding of the content (from 33 to five); and 3) that socio-affect’s decline was mainly due to a decline in the sub-function of expressing gratitude to the teacher (from 59 to 47), whereas small talk increased (from two to seven).

In the case of student-student interaction, changing patterns over time were somewhat different from those of student-teacher interaction, especially for the cognition and socio-affect functions: with the former more than doubling, from 22 to 49, and the latter increasing even more markedly, from two to 11. In other words, as the number of text-chat posts directed from students to the teacher fell, students directed more such posts to their peers, and most of the latter were coded as cognition or socio-affect.

When we took a deeper look at change within the cognition function in student-student interaction, we first found that the quantity of posts embodying this function increased, from seven in the first time period to 10 in the second. We also found that students became willing to disagree with one another, either implicitly (with the number of such occurrences rising from zero in the first half of the semester, to four in the second) or explicitly (rising from zero to seven). On the other hand, they also became more willing to support others’ ideas publicly (rising from six to 15).

# 5.  Discussion

The present exploratory study has expanded our understanding of the functions text chat can fulfill in an SCMC classroom, and the nuances and complexities of changes in the quantities and themes of such chat over time. The following subsections discuss the key findings and their implications in detail.

# 5.1.  Functions of text-chat interaction in SCMC

Most studies involving interaction in SCMC contexts have focused on its influence, rather than the interaction itself. In this study, we have helped to redress that absence by using content analysis to identify five functions (i.e. cognition, metacognition, socio-affect, organization, and technology) that text-chat SCMC interaction fulfills. This coding scheme reflects that cognitively meaningful and productive learning occurred through real-time interaction between learner and instructor, learner and learner, learner and content, and learner and technology (Gacs et  al., 2020; Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022). These results are consistent with previous studies that found text chat 1) is a major channel for participation (Côté & Gaffney, 2018; Peachey, 2017); 2) incorporates aspects of both speaking—e.g. when the student chooses to post, s/he is engaging in real-time communication with an interlocutor—and writing, as the text chat allows him/her to process linguistic input and produce output accordingly (Côté & Gaffney, 2018); 3) focuses on the cognitive use of language (Cheung, 2021b; Kern et  al., 2004; Moorhouse et  al., 2021; Payne, 2020; Strawbridge, 2021; Wang & Chen, 2009); 4) enables mutual social and affective communication (Chen et  al., 2009); 5) allows students to ask questions without interrupting the class (Kohne & Jarvis, 2021; Wang & Chen, 2009); and 6) can be used for troubleshooting when students experience problems using SCMC technology (Cheung, 2021b; Maican & Cocoradă, 2021; Zou et  al., 2021).

Although the research context of our study differed in many ways from those of Peeters (2018) and Pena-Shaff et  al. (2001), we nevertheless wanted to make a direct comparison between our taxonomy and theirs, in the hope that this would yield new insights about the possible communicative functions played by text chat. In terms of the general communicative functions of text-chat interaction, our findings and those of both these prior studies are consistent. Peeters’s four themes (i.e. cognition, metacognition, organization, and socio-affect) were fully reflected in our study’s SCMC language-learning context. However, our study’s one additional category, technology, was hardly negligible, with $1 2 . 7 \%$ of our sampled students’ chat posts fulfilling this function. This reflects a unique trait of educational SCMC: namely, that the stability of the technology is fundamental to its smooth operation (Gacs et  al., 2020). It should also be noted that around $7 0 \%$ of the posts in this category consisted of reports that the technology was working well, a further indication of the prominence of technology in SCMC classroom routines.

Our taxonomy also differs from Peeters’s (2018) mainly in its sub-function of cognition. That is, where Peeters used composing text (i.e. language-related posts) and making meaning (i.e. discussing and making arguments), we utilized a single term, clarification, comprising eight indicators that covered students’ language-related and meaning-making posts. In addition, we identified a more complex level of students’ cognitive activities via the five sub-functions—assertion, discussing questions, agreement, disagreement, and judgment—four of which (i.e. all except judgment) implied distributed and dialogic interaction with others from a sociocultural perspective (Vygotsky, 1978). This is important, given that learning tends to be more effective when students’ interaction transcends simple monologues and reaches the level of dialogical interaction (Pena-Shaff et  al., 2001).

More specifically, we found it promising that our data included sub-functions such as assertion and disagreement: signs of cognitive conflict that were not evident in Peeters’s (2018) study. Assertion, which was also only rarely detected in online interaction by Pena-Shaff et  al. (2001), requires that students pay attention to others’ posts and then try to defend their own original statements by providing further explanations. Our identification of episodes of assertion suggests that some of the student participants were both aware of disagreements during learning and willing to defend their own ideas when necessary. Notably, all the topics they were defending were related to academic writing, e.g. writing norms or word use, and their defenses confidently cited prior knowledge. This behavior tends to signal higher levels of knowledge construction, because it both stimulates discussions among multiple participants, and stems from learning content (Raković et  al., 2020). But on the other hand, the overall amount of assertion was very limited $\left( n = 6 \right)$ , especially as compared to the amount of disagreement $( n = 4 6 )$ , suggesting that only a minority of the sampled students were willing to engage in extended defenses of their initial ideas.

Looking more closely at the 46 posts that were coded as disagreement, it is worth noting that—in contrast to the approach adopted by Raković et  al. (2020), who operationalized disagreement as simple negation such as ‘I disagree’—all our codes reflected learners’ rationales. We regard this as a sign of higher-order cognitive learning, as disagreement is meaningful in educational contexts only when it acts as a premise for the facilitation of in-depth learning (Darabi et  al., 2011) and helps to translate learning stimuli into higher-order cognitive-thinking skills (Côté & Gaffney, 2018; Hampel, 2006; Yeh & Lai, 2019). When we reexamined our findings on this topic in light of Garrison et  al. (2000) Community of Inquiry framework, we found that critical discourse occurred when the learners we sampled resolved dissonance only through the first two of the four phases of cognitive presence, i.e. triggering events and exploration (the other two being integration and resolution). In our case, an example of triggering was when a student first explicitly disagreed with a previous post by another student regarding the use of which in a sentence. We considered this to be high-level cognitive activity because the expression of disagreement was spontaneous: students detected the disagreement and showed their willingness to discuss it openly. The same episode also indicates that the students were actively engaged in SCMC learning and paying attention to others’ contributions to class. In the second stage, exploration, more students joined in the discussion. The exploration phase, it should be noted, was rather limited in our study; i.e. almost all explorations were based on personal narration, belief or judgment, without citations of authoritative sources (Park, 2009). To be sure, part of this was governed by the nature of SCMC: all interactions occur in real time, affording students few opportunities to seek additional resources. However, the lack of authoritative sources in the exploration phase, coupled with the fact that the integration and resolution phases were simply missing, suggest that higher-order cognitive involvement among our student participants was fairly incomplete. Theoretically, consensus-building is a necessary stage after conflicts emerge, and involves clarifying misunderstanding, negotiating, and reaching final consensus (Pena-Shaff et  al., 2001). However, that stage is not easy to arrive at without appropriate support from the instructor (for a review, see Garrison, 2007). In our case, when disagreements occurred, the teacher became involved immediately by reading the relevant parts of the text chat and stating her own opinion on who was right. For example, when several students disagreed about an earlier post on the use of which, the teacher joined in the dialogue almost right away, which led to the termination of further discussion via text chat on this topic. We believe that this action in effect prevented students from learning through exploring and arguing, while at the same time reinforcing the belief, prevalent among Chinese students, that the teacher should be treated as the sole authority in the classroom (Zhang, 2013).

In addition, contrary to Pena-Shaff et  al. (2001) finding that people’s tone may become aggressive during disagreements, and that this can escalate into enduring interpersonal friction, $7 6 \%$ of the disagreements in our data were classified as mild rather than explicit. Even those classified as explicit, however, did not involve personal attacks or expressions of strong emotion. The sampled students even used emoticons (e.g. QAQ as a means of expressing sadness) to soften the tone of their disagreements. We attribute this to their Confucian-heritage cultural background. Previous studies have likewise shown that Chinese online learners tend to prioritize being polite, creating harmonious relationships, and avoiding explicit conflicts (Liu et al., 2010; Zhang, 2013).

Last but not least, it is useful to compare Peeters’s (2018) taxonomical category of metacognition with ours. Peeters recognized three communicative sub-functions under this category in online language learning— reflecting, synthesizing reflections, and planning—and further pointed out that, in the absence of such sub-functions, individuals would be less likely to reflect upon and adjust their own learning when in online settings. We, on the other hand, found that the only component of the metacognition function during SCMC was students’ self-reflection on learning and on their emotions: a situation that only partly represents the cyclical process of metacognitive ability proposed by Zimmerman (2000). Part of the reason for this discrepancy may be the asynchronous nature of the environment in Peeters’s study, which allowed students more time to engage in monologue-like, reflective and analytical thinking processes (see also Pena-Shaff et  al., 2001). Of course, this is not to say that such functions could never be accomplished in SCMC. On the contrary, the students in our sample made self-appraisals of their learning on both cognitive and emotional levels, highlighting the importance of self-regulation in online learning (Author, 2021). It should also be noted, however, that observing self-reflection in SCMC interaction does not, by itself, demonstrate that metacognition is occurring. Among the numerous taxonomies of metacognition that are available (e.g. O’Malley et  al., 1990; Oxford, 1990; Wenden, 1998), a prominent one (Brown et  al., 1983) divides it into knowledge and strategies; and the self-appraisal of learning and emotion captured in our study only reflect the latter, and then only partially.

# 5.2.  Change in patterns of learners’ text-chat interaction over time

When we traced quantitative change in text chat’s functions over time, we noted a decline in the quantity of text-chat interactions in general. In addition, we found that such communication directed from students to the teacher exhibited a somewhat different pattern of change from that exchanged between students. In the former case, there was a decline in the total amount, especially in the cognition function. In the latter, there was an increase: between the first half of the semester and the second half, students sent more text-chat posts to their peers to show socio-affect, agreement, and disagreement.

Within the category of student-student interaction, our finding of a quantitative increase in interaction is well aligned with Zheng and Warschauer (2015) finding that networks among students became denser over time. We further found that this increase mainly resided in cognition- and affect-related text chat: a possible sign of improvement in the quality of such chat among students. Although we did not specifically test for what caused this increase in interactivity, we can surmise two reasons for it. The primary one is that the increased interaction was a direct embodiment of improvements in the teacher’s pedagogical approach across the semester. That is, she regularly asked students to provide feedback regarding their SCMC learning experience, and in response, many of them expressed a desire to have more interaction with their peers. The teacher then adjusted her instructional approach accordingly, by explicitly encouraging students to use the chat window to make comments to one another. Indeed, this endeavor to promote student-student interaction was an excellent example of Interaction Competence by a language teacher (Walsh, 2013), and especially noteworthy due to its non-traditional language-learning context. The second possible explanation is that, as students proceeded with the course, they became more familiar with some or many of their peers through working jointly on projects outside of class time. Thus, the course became a more coherent and comfortable learning environment over time, as evidenced by the observed increase in the amount of affect-related text chat; and this, in turn, helped to foster a shared sense of community (Lin & Gao, 2020). It is in part due to experiencing this shared sense of community that students are able increase their cognitive output, especially at the exploration level (Garrison, 2007). In our case, expressions of agreement and/ or disagreement mostly reflected students’ exploration and exchange of information.

It is also worth noting that, at least at face value, our finding of enhancement over time in student-student interaction contradicts those of some previous studies (Chen et  al., 2009; Guan et  al., 2006; Yang et  al., 2015), in which the quality of text chat deteriorated. However, this apparent discrepancy was likely because those earlier studies did not include the participation of the teacher at all, whereas in ours, the teacher played a central role in delivering, guiding, and adjusting the SCMC course throughout. That being said, the teacher’s presence or responsibility was nevertheless distributed to each student in those prior studies. In language-learning cases without explicit guidance from the teacher, the more-capable students will inevitably take some responsibility for teaching and otherwise assisting their less-able counterparts (Sato, 2008). Therefore, prior findings regarding a damage to interaction quality are indeed echoed in our finding that, in the second half of the sampled semester, there were fewer cognition-related student-teacher text-chat exchanges. The sharp drop in this subcategory of the cognition function is not surprising because, as noted in the Methods section, the routine of each class was quite consistent throughout the semester. This means that how information was introduced, how students responded to it, and how the teacher provided feedback to those responses aligned stably with what Sinclair and Coulthard (1975) labeled the Initiation-Response-Follow-up (IRF) exchange structure. As Walsh and Sert (2019) have noted, simply following the IRF unchangingly and inflexibly may give rise to ‘a rather mechanical, stilted type of interaction’ (p. 3). In our case, a fixed mode of teacher-student IRF in SCMC sessions may have been partly to blame for the observed deterioration in the quantity of student-initiated text chat reflecting the cognition function.

Additionally, we would suggest that decrease in teacher-student interaction and increase in student-student interaction that we observed in the second half of the course could have been a result of the nature of the unit topics. That is, the first four units—An introduction to academic English, Abstracts, Introductions, and Literature reviews—seemed to merit lecture-based instruction, as students were unlikely to be familiar with academic English at the beginning of the course. After several weeks of learning, however, they were likely to have gained more knowledge about it, and therefore to be more comfortable about exchanging opinions about the learning material. In other words, growing topic familiarity could at least partially explain why more teacher-student interaction was seen during the first four units and more student-to-student interactions in the last four.

Given our finding of a downward trend in the amount of student-teacher text chat, and an upward one in its student-student counterpart, it would be reasonable to assume that transforming the course into a wholly student-centered one would be beneficial. However, we feel that this would not work, for two reasons. First, such a change would mean that the entire class would share a mutual teaching responsibility, and therefore be likely to replicate the text-chat quality deterioration observed in previous studies (Chen et  al., 2009; Guan et  al., 2006; Yang et  al., 2015). Second, a predictable and stable teacher-centered approach was deemed desirable and even necessary by the members of our sample themselves. Though this is at variance with Peeters and Pretorius (2020) findings, our student participants expressed appreciation for the focal course’s strong teacher-centered network and the fact that such a network was maintained throughout the semester. As the teacher in our study reflected in her teaching notes, ‘the most valuable part to them was my showcasing and interpretation of their common mistakes in written assignments. Also, since many of those errors were quite isolated, I tried to organize them into themes in order to present them systematically to students’. We believe that the key to preventing deterioration in student-teacher text chat resides mostly in 1) teachers’ metacognitive monitoring of their own teaching practices (Walsh & Sert, 2019) and 2) class members’ behavior (Chen et  al., 2009). After all, as Gacs et  al. (2020) recently pointed out, there is no reason to avoid teacher-centered instruction, provided that it is designed purposefully, consistently, and clearly.

# 5.3.  Teaching implications

It is unrealistic to expect that learning in SCMC will ‘happen naturally without facilitation’ (Chen et  al., 2009, p. 1164). In light of the findings of the current study, we recommend that more thoughtful and conscious teaching designs aimed at facilitating interaction (Vu & Fadde, 2013) be adopted in SCMC contexts. Specifically, we propose the following design principles for SCMC language teaching. First, instead of treating text chat in SCMC as a supplementary tool to the audio and video functions (Wang & Chen, 2009), it should be reconsidered as a major venue for classroom participation (Cheung, 2021b), and educators should make full use of the text chat for fulfilling multiple purposes during teaching, including but not limited to cognition, metacognition, socio-affect, organization, and technology.

Second, more explicit instruction regarding metacognitive awareness should be given to students, to develop both their metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive strategies, and thus help them to better understand both themselves and their learning tasks (Wenden, 1991). For example, teachers could guide students to think about their individual characteristics that may affect learning (Rahimi & Katal, 2012), or explicitly ask questions regarding the development of metacognitive strategies and allow students to input their answers in the chat box.

Third, interactive activities that embed expressions of assertion, agreement, disagreement, and/or synthesizing multiple learners’ ideas are likely to strongly benefit students’ translation of learning stimuli into higher-order cognitive thinking skills, as part of a meaningful knowledge-exchange process (Côté & Gaffney, 2018; Hampel, 2006; Yeh & Lai, 2019). Specifically, when students use text chat to express disagreement, teachers should not jump in immediately; rather, if time permits, they should allow their students to reach a final resolution of the disagreement on their own. Or, if in-class time is limited, teachers should design out-of-class activities that allow students to solve the problem under distributed cognition (Sato, 2008).

Lastly, teachers need to be aware of a potential drop over time in both the overall quantity of student-teacher interaction, and the proportion of such interaction taken up by the cognition function. To address this problem, they should give due attention to opportunities to monitor their own interaction behavior and participate in more cognitive, interactive and innovative activities in class.

# 5.4.  Limitations and future directions

This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the course we observed lasted only eight weeks, but met twice per week. In light of previous findings that interaction patterns in SCMC vary across long and short tutorial phases (Shi & Stickler, 2018), future comparative studies of multiple courses could usefully address whether course length is a significant variable in predicting different patterns of interaction in SCMC. Second, the present study identified changes in the focal course’s text-chat functions across time mainly by calculating the frequency of each code. Future research could usefully adopt a two-mode form of SNA that includes both nodes and types of text chat, to visually reflect such longitudinal change (Wu & Nian, 2021). Third, future studies should consider how learning performance is associated with interaction patterns. Fourth, because the focal course was primarily teacher-centered, the interaction patterns we observed might not have been authentic, insofar as the instructor had the authority to control how she interacted with students and how students interacted with each other. This happened especially when students disagreed about a particular post, and the teacher intervened almost immediately, which had the effect of terminating of further student-student text chat on the disputed topic. And fifth, because this study took place in a real classroom setting, we were not able to partial out external factors such as sudden technical problems encountered by the teacher, or how much of the improvement in student-student interaction was due to the teacher’s explicit encouragement. Therefore, when interpreting the results, readers need to be aware that the changes in interaction over time that we have described were not the result of learner behavior alone, but of a combination of learners’ internal changes and various external factors that inevitably coexist with such changes in real classroom settings.

# 6.  Conclusion

To shed light on the complex dynamics of online language classrooms, this exploratory study identified the functions fulfilled by Chinese postgraduate English-language learners’ text chat during a semester-long SCMC course, and further explored changes in patterns of their text-chat interaction over the semester. Content analysis revealed that the text chat could be classified into five functions (i.e. cognition, metacognition, socio-affect, organization, and technology). The cognition function was found to account for more than half of all student-generated comments, and to have seven sub-functions: assertion, clarification, discussing questions, showing understanding, disagreement, agreement, and judgment. On the one hand, we found promising signs of higher-order cognitive involvement such as assertion, agreement, disagreement, and questioning in the focal online-learning environment; but on the other, the overall incidence of such involvement was limited. In addition, although the text chat collected in this study showed signs of students’ metacognitive reflection, other metacognitive abilities such as synthesizing and planning were not observed in it. When we looked at changes in the text chat’s functions over time, we observed a decline in the quantity of text-chat interactions in general, which was driven entirely by a fall in the amount of student-teacher interaction, which was especially marked when it came to posts related to the cognition function; whereas student-student interaction actually increased, as the learners directed more numerous text-chat posts to their peers to show affect, cognitive agreement and disagreement in the second half of the semester than in the first half.

Technology is continuously reshaping the ways we deliver language education, and SCMC instruction—especially with the use of text chat— should not be neglected. As a contribution to the debate on whether synchronous online language teaching is ‘a blessing or a curse’ (Cheung, 2021b, p. 1), this study has attempted to capture the nuances and complexities of English language learners’ text-chat interactions in a synchronous L2 academic-English class, as a means of enriching current understandings of the complexity of language learners’ interactions in SCMC contexts. The findings also have a practical value, by pointing the way to more effective SCMC language teaching that makes fuller use of text-chat interaction.
