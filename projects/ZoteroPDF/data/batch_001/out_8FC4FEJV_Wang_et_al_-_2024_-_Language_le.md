Interaction is an indispensable part of language learning. Artificial intelligence (Al) has been increasingly applied in language learning to promote interaction in the learning process. In response to the paradigmatic shifts in AI application design, this review maps the research landscape of language learning development in human-AI interaction. From the resulting analysis of 49 studies, this study investigates the contextual characteristics by AI-supported interaction type, AI application, target language, educational level, etc. Moreover, three research paradigms are identified in this emerging field, i.e., Paradigm One (AI-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, learner-as-recipient), Paradigm Two (AI/teacher-codirected, learner-as-collaborator), and Paradigm Three (AI/teacher/learner-codirected). The paradigms are induced through analysis of eight constructs: human-AI relationship, learning objective, task type, level of pre-structuring, mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change process, cognitive outcome, and research focus. The philosophical and linguistic underpinnings for each paradigm are discussed. Additionally, we highlight future research implications including investigating under-researched themes and exploring diverse methodological possibilities and appropriateness among the three research paradigms.

# 1. Introduction

Recent research has proposed paradigmatic shifs in artificial intelligence (Al) application and research. In the field of AI alication developmet, there ha b paradgmatic shf from chnology-ntred apprcho a human-ntred approach. hile the fousof the shift has primaril moved from enhancing technology through high lels of automation to understanding and meeting human needs (Shneiderman, 2020), afresh vision, known as the human-centered AI approach, further develops the human-centered approach, for emphasizing thethicall aligned design of AI to empower people while ensuring human control of AI (Donahoe, 2018; Li, 2018; u et al. 2023). Similarly, in education, paradigmatic shifs in the use of Al have been identified, moving from Al-directed, Al-supported, to AI-empowreducational practices (Ouyang & Jiao, 2021). Buldg on thee sifts, I in ducation has bevolving to promot lener agency, personalized lerning, and metacognitive skills (Ouyang & Jiao, 2021). Human-AI interaction (HAll s iteratively developing toward lnercentered peronalizationSundar, 2020). However,in light fthe xnt ctional thries, nw intrttions fromthe learning sciences are encouraged to shed light on the transparent and inclusive use of Al in education (Hwang et al., 2020.

Language learning is under the influence f these paradigmatic shifts. Language learning is traditionally a discipline dominated by human-human interaction between teachers and learners, and among learners. Participation in interaction assts language leaners in obtaining input and feedback, and modifying and adjusting output in ways that expand learners' interlanguage capacity (Pica t l. 1996). With more and more AI technologies to facilitate language learning, HAll is supplementing human-human interaction in language lerning (Fu et l., 2020). HAll benefit language learners by providing promising solutions to inricate problems in language learning clarooms, such as lac f personalized feedack tostudents (Chen et al., 2022), inadequate language practice opportunities (Hsiao et al., 2015), and shyness or anxiety to talk in a new language (Leeuwestein et al., 2021).

Despite the affordances of HAl for language learning development, some issues have surfaced. Key issues that call for resolutions include critical examination of emerging paradigms, such as how they are related to methodologies, and how learning will be transformed (Vostroknutov et al., 2021). Moreover, understanding ifferent theoretical perspectives in HAll in the current context exerts critical influences on the quality of teaching and learning (Hwang et al., 2020).

Thus, this review aims to map the research landscape of language learning development in HAll by investigating contextual characteristic ofthe research and identifying rearch paradigms. This study contributes to the existing literature by responding tothe call for future research on language learning development in HAll (Hwang et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2021; Ouyang & Jia0, 2021; Vostroknutov et al., 2021). Mapping the research landscape in the field may help researchers, teachers, Al developers, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders pinpoint their research orientations on language learning development in HAI, structure inquiry, and explicate philosophical and linguistic assumptions underlying their methodological choices.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Language learning development through interaction

Learning occurs in meaningful interaction with other humans, in an open and authentic environment, and in real-life situations directly relevant to leners' experiences (Gray, 2019). Tradtionally, interaction refers to the reciprocal face-to-face actions through either verbal channels including written or spoken words, or nonverbal channels such a touch, facial expression, gesture, posture, and environment factors (Lindberg et al., 2021). During class interactions, learners have helpful conversations that may faciliate the development of language skills.

In language learning development, verbal interaction should provide a context for negotiation of meaning to facilitate classroom oral exchanges that span from formal drilling to authentic meaning-focused information exchanges (Yeh & Lai, 2019). Language learners first need to reeive comprehensible linguistic input t communicate authenticlly through spoken or written language, and then they listen to others' authentic linguistic output and respond to continue the communicative events (Yenkimaleki & van Heuven, 2021). Consequently, the context for oral interaction is created.

Nonverbal interaction involves nonverbal behaviors including environment fctors, physical characteristics of communicators, and various behaviors displayed by communicators (Wang & Cheung, 2024). Verbal and nonverbal behaviors interrelate during interaction in that nonverbal behaviors can repeat, conflict with, complement, substitute, and regulate verbal behaviors (Remland, 2016) Therefore, creating intended nonverbal behaviors in clasroom interaction is necessary for language learning development.

# 2.2. Language learning development through human-AI interaction

Educators have been embracing new technologies to improve language learning, with AI emerging as one of the latest technologies AI generally refers to computer systems designed to interact with humans, performing human-like capabilities such as visual perception and speech recognition, and intelligent behaviors such as asessing information and then taking actions that align with a predefined goal (Luckin et al., 2016). Common AI technologies include machine learning, natural language procesing, data mining, and artificial neural networks. Nowadays, AI has significant applications in language learning for the affordances of interacting naturally with humans, predicting learners' future performance, and providing personalized learning content, instant feedback, and

objective assessment of learners' progress (Pokrivcakova, 2019).

As AI is increasingly applied in language learning, language learning development through human-AI interaction has become a noteworthy topic (Wang et a., 2023). Human-AI interaction (HAIl) stems from human-computer interaction (HCI) which aims to achieve optimal fit in product design among users, computers, and required services (Te'eni, 2006). The current transformation towards HAll uilds on AI's reasoning capabilities, prediction, and analysis power to act as autonomous agents that can make decisions on their own (Virvou, 2022). Acording t various applications of AI in HAll, there are four levels of HAlI: low-level sensor-based AI application (e.g., voice/face/gesture recognition), medium-level interaction software systems (e.g, natural language processing), high-level intraction software systems or module , intelligent tutoring system), and high-level interaction application field e., education and health) (Virvou, 2022).

In education, HAl seeks the fit i instuctional design between Al and humans (i., teachers and students) to facilitate learning. Based on Rajagopal and Vedamanickam (2019), the adapted HAll model in the educational environment is shown in Fig. 1. Fig.1 indicates that AI can interact with students autonomously, with or without teachers involvement, in the Al-supported educational environment. When teachers are involved, teachers collaborate with students to adjust instructional strategies and leaning approaches based on AI' feedack, and the adjustments by teachers and students also influence Al to deliver more personalized feedback on instruction and learning. When teachers are not involved, AI operates autonomously to adjust and personalize educational content based solely on students responses. Ideally, the fit in instructional design betwee AI and humans (i.., teachers and students) can be gradually adjusted and achieved.

HAll has the potential to improve language learning by ofring various contexts for negotiating meaning verbally and exhibiting nonverbal behaviors. Interactive Al applications, such as chatbots, inteligent agents, and conversational agents, are able to create contexts of interaction through natural conversation by providing information, discussing specific topics, and performing tasks (Smutny & Schreiberova, 2020). In oral interaction, negotiation of meaning occurs when AI applications choose appropriate language inputs according to leaners language proficiency and provide personalized responses to students so that they may practice output in meaningful interaction (Kim, 2017). Moreover, Al applications associated with robotics display nonverbal behaviors with faces arms, and appearances. With nonverbal behaviors, language learning processi perceived to be enjoyable, fun, and interactive (Lin e l., 2022). HAll has been reported to develop learners language proficiency through these verbal and nonverbal channels (Wanget al., 2023).

# 2.3. Paradigmatic shifts of language learning development in human-AI interaction

The field f HAl is currently experiencing a paradigmatic shft of AI application development from a technology-centered approach to a human-centered approach, during which a new vision called a human-centered Al approach extends the human-centered approach by emphasizing ethically aligned designs of AI (Xu et al., 2023). Initiall, the development of AI primarily relied on a "technology-centered design" approach. Researchers and developers concentrated on building AI algorithms and systems, emphasizing machine learning, and measuring algorithm performance (Shneiderman, 2022). However, ignoring the importance of human factors in the design led to the failure of many AI systems, biased Al-based decision-making applications, and concerns over prejudice and inequality for certain users (toutsi e l., 2020). Thefore, since 2015, many critics hav voiced ther conces regarding thecreation of a world ruled by AI and called for prioritizing human factors (Hawking et l., 2015; Russll et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2023). The human-centered approach urges the need to fully understand AlI-based machine behavior and its impacts on humans and society (Xu et al., 2023). To further respond to the concerns, Standford University proposed a human-centered AI aproach in 2018 (Donahoe, 2018; Li, 2018). This approach, rooted in the \*human-centered" philoophy, extends the human-centere approach by advocating the ethically aligned design of AI to empower and enable humans, while revealing the underlying values, limitations, and ethics of data algorithms to encourage ethical, interactive, and contestable use (Capel & Brereton, 2023).

The paradigmatic shift f AI application development in HAll has brought in changes in many spheres of our life among which the field of language leaning is ignificantly influenced because advances in Al are enabling Al to have considerable potential for language learning development (Godwin-Jones, 2023). Under the influence, language leaning also experiences paradigmatic shift over time (Liang et al., 2021). How to understand the paradigms in the current context that language learning has been developed in HAll, how the paradigms are associated with methodologies, and how the paradigms transform learning remains unclear (Vostroknutov et al. 2021). To move through the literature and establish a shared understanding of the research landscape, this study aims to answer the following research questions (RQ):

RQ1: What are the contextual characteristics of research on language learning development in human-Al interaction? RQ2: What research paradigms of language learning development can be identified in human-AI interaction?

# 3. Methods

This study presents a thematic review of the studies on language learning development in human-Al interaction. A thematic review is an appropriate approach for it summarizes the findings of an emerging reearch field by focusing on insights of themes from related studies (Hakimi et al., 2021; Ultay & Calk, 2012). To achieve this, we followed the PRIsMA guidelines to investigate the themes: research contexts and paradigms (Page et al., 2021). Relevant studies were examined. Thus, research contexts and unique features of each paradigm were explicitly revealed. What fllowed was an interpretative account of mplications for futur reearch. The reporting flowchart aligns with PRIsMA recommendations (Page et al., 2021), with minor modifications to address this study's purposes as

shown in Fig. 2. The specific methods used are described below.

# 3.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Before conducting the literature search, we established a set of inclusion criteria. First, the study was conducted with AI technologies so any study using tools without AI technologies such as non-intelligent tutoring systems and multimediaplatforms was excluded. Second, the study was conducted for language learning, so any study for other purposes such as evaluating the effectiveness of an AI system or using AI to analyze data was excluded. Third, the study was conducted in regular educational setings, so any study in therapeutic contexts was excluded. Fourth, the study included the necessary information as recommended by What Works Clearinghouse to describe studie and report indings clearly and comprehensively (What Works learinghouse, 2021), such as experimental conditions, participants' characteristics, study designs, and measures. Any study without the necessary descriptions of studies and reporting of findings was excluded. Fifth, the study included empirical information, so any study about the design of an AI system was excluded. Sixth, the study was written in English, so any study writte in other languages was excluded. Seventh, the same study was included only once. If multiple articles reported on the same study, the article with the most description and empirical evidence was included.

# 3.2. Search strategy

To address the research questions, we examined literature within the six databases: Web of Science, ERIC, Scopus, IEE Xplore. PsycINFO, and ProQuest. These databases were chosen because they are commonly used in literature reviews on education, psychology, social sciences (Berkowitz et al., 2017), and computer science research (Clark et a., 2016). Besides published articles, we also retrieved unublishd literaturei., confrnce rocedngs, disrttions, and theeue to the emering nature of this field to gain the most up-to-date information about Al applications in language learning and to minimize potential publication bias (Borenstein et al., 2021).

The iterature search was performed with six sets of query terms isted in Table A1 of the appendix, including terms related to (1) HAll proces (Rapp et al., 2021), 2) artificial intellice (awacki-Richter e al., 2019), (3)edctional levels (awacki-Richter t al, 2019), (4) learning settings, (5) language education, and (6) research paradigms. The six sets of terms were integrated with Boolean operators (Cooper, 2017), specifically with the \*OR" operator within each set and the \*AND" operator between sets. Moreover, we performed another round of search by examining the reference lists of rerieved sources. The timeframe of the search was not limited to a specific period as this is relatively an emerging topic.

# 3.3. Study screening and selection procedure

The literature search was conducted between May and June 2023. From the six databases, we retrieved 6540 article. Afer removing duplicates, we screened the remaining 5491 articles in a three-phase screening process, as indicated in Fig. 2.First, we reviewed the title, keywords, and astact according to the inclusion criteria. This excluded 5322 artice and left 169 articles for the next phase. Second, all the 169 articles underwent a full-text review. By reading the full text, we obtained 46 articles ater excluding 123 articles. The reasons for exclusion are listed in Fig. 2. Third, the reference lists of the 46 studies were screened to identify additional eligible studies. This phase retrieved three more articles. Altogether the three-phrase screening proces resulted in the selection of 49 eligible articles. During the screning and selection process, one of the researchers cooperated with another independent researcher who was experienced in conducting review studies on the application of Al in education. The interrater reliability of percent agreement reached $9 2 \%$ . The two researchers discussed the resulting discrepancies until reaching a consensus.

# 3.4. Analysis and coding of selected studies

To answer RQ1, contextual characteristics f research on language learning development in HAIl, we analyzed the description of the 49 studies. Then we synthesized contextual information from the eght aspects: year of publication, the country or region where the study was conducted, sample size, Al application, target language, language domain, educational level, and Al-supported interaction type (see able A in the appendix). The former five aspects were coded based on the descrition of the rticles. The latter three aspects were coded as follows. First, language domains were divided into eight categories (Hung et al., 2018; Nunan, 199), including four language skils (i.e, listening, speaking, reading, and writing), three language components (i.., pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar) (Pouresmaeil & Vali, 2023; Simon & Taverniers, 2011), and integrated domains. Second, educational levels were divided into five categories: preschool, primary, secondary, higher, and mixed education (Hung et al., 2018). Third, based on the number of students and Als involved in the study, Al-supported interaction types were coded into thre categories: individual use of an Al, group use of an AI, and inter-group use of AIs. Individual use of an AI means that each student interacts with an AI application individuall. Group use of an AI represents that a group of students interacts with an AI application, either face to face or Al-mediated. Inter-group use of AIs refers to interaction between groups via AI aplications when groups are not in the same place such as chats, newsgroups, and online forums (Strijbos e al., 2004). This coding investigates how Al has been used to support interaction in language learning. To addres RQ2, research paradigms of language learning development in HAll, we performed a thematic content analysis. To reveal important constructs of research paradigms, we used two frameworks to guide our intial analysis and coding: the computersupported proces-oriented interaction framework (Strijbos et al., 2004) and the engagement framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014). From the former interaction framework, three key dimensions that influenced computer-supported interaction were coded as constructs of research paradigms: learning objective, task type, and level of pre-structuring (Strijbos et al., 2004). Since interaction is highly associated with engagement in learning (Crook, 1998), we added three critical constructs from the latter engagement framework: mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change proces, and cognitive outcome (Chi & Wylie, 2014). While using the six constructs as a priori, we did not forcefull impose them onto research paradigms. During several rounds of qualitative coding, we adopted an inductive approach to allow for new constructs (if any) to emerge.

After the open coding proces, the coded constructs were summarized into areas of convergence across the selected studies to identify potential different constructs or paradigms (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Just as adopted by the thematic reviews (Hakimi et al. 2021; Tieken & Auldridge-Reveles, 2019), we focused on findings that were supported by multiple sources, and examined thematically relevant counterevidence or divergent findings, both within and betwen contexts. After drafing and revising summative research memos, we synthesized our findings, which we present below.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Contextual characteristics

Table A2 in the appendix presents the contextual characteristics of al the 49 studies. First as for the year of publication, these studies were published between 2008 and 2022, s shown in Fig. 3. The articles were divided into three phases, namely 2008-2014, 2015-2017, and 2018-2022, according to the paradigmatic shft of Al application development from a technology-centered approach to a human-centered approach called for by many critics in 2015 (Hawking et al., 2015; Rusell t al., 2015; Xu et al., 2023), and the recommendation of the human-centered AI approach by Stanford University in 2018 (Donahue, 2018; Li, 2018). There were seven articles (2008-2014), seven (2015-2017), and 35 (2018-2022). The findings indicated an increasing research interest in investigating language learning development in HAl, which was particularly asociated with the paradigmaticshift towards the human-centered AI approach since 2018.

Second, the top nine geographic locations in which the studies were conducted were Taiwan $( n = 9 )$ , the mainland of China $( n = 7 )$ United States $\left( n = 5 \right)$ , Japan $( n = 4 )$ , Germany $( n = 3 )$ , Iran $( n = 3 )$ , Kazakhstan $( n = 3 )$ , Korea $( n = 3$ , and Netherlands $( n = 3 )$ . Nine other articles included such countries as the United Kingdom, Russia, and Italy (one article from each).

Third, regarding the educational level, Fig. 4 shows the distribution of participants' educational levels. A total of 16 studies were conducted in elementary education, accounting for the largest proportion of all participants $( 3 3 \% )$ , followed by 13 in higher education $( 2 7 \% )$ , 10 in preschool education $( 2 0 \% )$ , and 10 in secondary education $( 2 0 \% )$

Fourth, as for the sample size, except one study with an unspecified number of students (Chen et al., 2021), 48 other studies had an   
average number of about 86 students, totaling 4114 learners, including 18 studies $( \le 5 0 )$ , 22 studies $( 5 1 \sim 1 0 0 )$ , and 8 studies $\left( \geq 1 0 1 \right)$ Fifth, concerning the target language, English was the dominant language of the studies. A total of 39 out of 49 studies learned   
English as the target language $( 8 0 \% )$ . followed bv three studies for Chinese $( 6 \% )$ . two for Dutch $( 4 \% )$ . and two for French $( 4 \% )$ . etc.

Sixth, as Fig. 5 shows, language domains included integrated skills $( 2 9 \% )$ , vocabulary $( 2 7 \% )$ , speaking $( 2 2 \% )$ , writing $( 1 6 \% )$ , and reading $( 6 \% )$ . Integrated skill involved, for instance, a combination of vocabulary, grammar, and sentence patterns (Al Hakim et al., 2022), or listening, speaking, reading, and writing (Hong et al., 2016).

Seventh, regarding the AI application, AI technologies were mostly incorporated into the application of robots in 28 studies $( 5 7 \% )$ followed by chatbots in eight studies $( 1 6 \% )$ , and automated writing evaluation systems in seven studies $( 1 4 \% )$ . Three studies $( 6 \% )$ included intelligent tutoring systems, which use Al technologies to provide adaptive feedback, personalized learning content, and individualized learning path navigation (Mousavinasab et al., 2021), compared to non-intelligent tutoring systems without Al technologies that deliver uniform feedack, static learning content, and pre-determined learning path navigation (Weimann et al. 2022) Other Al applications were automatic speech recognition systems, virtual realit, and Internet of Things intellgent image.

Eighth, in the Al-supported interaction type, individual use of an AI was the most common type. In 30 out of 49 studies, each student interacted with an AI application individually $( 6 1 \% )$ . A sum of 17 studies employed group use of an AI $( 3 5 \% )$ , in which a group of students interacted with an AI application, either face to face or Al-mediated. Only two studies applied inter-group use of AIs $( 4 \% )$ In the two studies (Obari et al., 2020; Obari & Lambacher, 2019), different student groups used different AI peakers with virtual reality to learn, whil recording movie clips of learning experiences and uploading to Facebook. Then the groups interacted with each other to present their learning experiences. In this way, students developed their language learning through interaction with AIs.

# 4.2. Research paradigms

For RQ2, we conducted a thematic analysis, using grounded theory as an analytical approach, to explore a specific topic i., language learning development in HAl) though an inductive process and develop a theoretical understanding (Corbin & Strauss 1990). After rounds of qualitative coding and refinement, eight constructs within four domains emerged: (1) human-AI relationship, (2) key dimensions that influence HAlI (i.e, learning objective, task type, and level of pre-structuring), (3) learners' engagement behavior in learning process and cognitive outcomes (i.e., mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change process, and cognitive outcome), and (4) research focus. By selective coding, we integrated themes, subthemes, and their relationships from the findings of open and axial coding (Kim & So, 2022). Finally, we identified three research paradigms of language learning development in HAII: Paradigm One (Al-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, learner-as-recipient), Paradigm Two (AI/teacher-codirected, learner -as-collaborator), and Paradigm Thre (AI/teacher/learner-codirected). Table 1 displays the conceptualization of these paradigms. Summaries of studies that primarily focus on different paradigms are shown in the appendix, including Table A3 (Paradigm One: 32 studies), Table A4 (Paradigm Two: 12 studies), and Table A5 (Paradigm Three: five studies).

# 4.2.1. Paradigm One: AI-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, learner-as-recipient

Paradigm One is characterized as Al-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, and learner-as-recipient. AI directs the learning process with pre-specified domain knowledge, and teachers are either directly involved in or indirectly support the instructional processto help learners receive knowledge acording to pre-determined learning pathways (McCarthy et al., 2019; Schodde et al., 2019). The paradigm is associated with the Al-centered design approach grounded in technology-centered design. Technology-centered design is characterized with technical rationality of imparting expert knowledge to users, and the expert knowledge is often decided by de. signers or clients (Krippendorff, 2005). AI professionals are dedicated to studying algorithms to represent how expert language knowledge operates and to certify the efectivenes of Al in language leaning. A typical xample is the earlier work of robots Hsiao et al., 2015; Hyun et al., 2008). While these robots offred learners immediate feedback about incorrect replies and directed the learning proces, they did not build a personalized knowledge base or capture learners psychological profile to provide individualized feedback.

4.2.1.1. Human-AI relationship. This paradigm demonstrates a stimulus-response relationship between AI and humans (Farooq & Grudin, 2016). AI responds to learners' input through fixed algorithms and logic rules that have been programmed into the expert system. The speech and text automated marking technologies enable language earning to be assessed (Chen et al., 2022. Thus, AI mainly plays the role of an assessor (Balkibekov et al., 2016; Su et a., 2020). Teachers are the ultimate director who monitors the process of language testing and evaluates students' language learning according to standardized test outcomes, which is based on statistical algorithms that model the criteria of markers, expert, or examinations boards (Richardson & Clesham, 2021). Students are test takers performing the assessment tass within a predetermined cope (Jeon, 2021). Their language learning i reflcted by grades or scores.

4.2.1.2. Key dimensions that influence human-Al interaction. First, the learning objective is to measure learning to categorize students and report judgments to researchers or teachers. Grades or scores are considered to determine students' levels of success or language proficiency at a particular time (Chen et a., 2022). Second, to achiee the ojective, this paradigm often adopts closed-ended language learning tasks. The closed-ended tasks require avariety of closed-ended iformation,consist of several successive question-and-answer steps, and can be solved by adding information each time. Common closed-ended tasks include multiple choice, item-matching, item-sequencing, true-false tasks, etc. (Balkibekov et al., 2016; Hsiao et al., 2015). Third, this paradigm has a high level of pre-structured interaction in the AI-supported environment. Examples are that learners matched pictures and words at increasing levels of dificulty in questions (Kennedy et al, 2016), or that HAll was pre-programmed in the same script across ifferent groups (Leeuwestein et al., 2021), or that I was set to either always win or lose when playing a game with learners (Meirbekov et al, 2016). In the high level of pre-structured interaction, learners are expected to give limited responses to follow specific pre-programmed scaffolding pathways.

4.2.1.3. Learners engagement behavior in learnng proces and cognitive outcomes. The mode of learners' engagement behavior is either passive receiving or active manipulating (Chi & Wylie, 2014). Passive receiving mode involves the lowest level of cognitive engagement, such as istening to Al instruction, watching robot gestures, or reading multimedia cues on screen (Vogt et al., 2019). Active manipulating mode occurs when students undertake overt psychomotor actions in interacting with Al instruction, such as the motor control of butons and physical movement responding to AI interface (Alemi & Haeri, 2020). However, there is no clearly defined boundary between being attention focused and unfocused (Chi & Wylie 2014). Therefore, in this paradigm, learners interact with AI in either passive receiving or active manipulating mode.

Regarding knowledge-change process, language develops from storing information to integrating new information with prior knowledge. When students interact with Al, new information can initiall e stored in their memory, and then be integrated into their knowledge once manipulations of engaging with the learning content occur (Wang et al., 2013). In the process, language learning is expected to suplement, expand, or strengthen the existing schema of knowledge. Moreover, cognitive outcomes in the paradigm are to recall or apply new knowledge to similar context created by l with aceptable and authentic tasks that facilitate language ractice (Chen et al., 2021).

4.2.1.4. Research focus. The reearch in the paradigm focuses on the effctiveness of language learning in HAll, such as language achievements, afective influence, and behavioral changes (Konijn et al., 2022; Schodde et al., 2019). The interaction mode among teachers, learners, and AI is situated in a controlled environment where learners learn language with AI. Effectiveness i often examined between the treatment group and the control group. In the proces, teachers either incorporate Al into classoom teaching or assign students to learn independently with AI.

Results from these studies showed that learners who interacted with AI to learn language achieved higher outcomes than those who did not (lemi et l., 2014; Dg e a., 2022; Hyun et al., 2008). pcificall, AI could foster students socal engagment in interaction and enhance their vocabulary performance through positive emotional fedback (Ahmad et al., 2019). Furthermore, the treatment group, which used AI for dynamic asessment f the learning process gained significantly more vocabulary compared to the control group (Jeon, 2021). These results indicate that with adances in AI computing, adaptive techniques, information procesing, et., HAII provides learners with interactive oral practices, immediat feedack, individualized learning content, while simultaneously boosting motivation and engagement, and reducing language learning anxiety.

# 4.2.2. Paradigm Two: AI/teacher-codirected, learner-as-collaborator

Paradigm Two is characterized as Al/teacher-codirected and learner-as-collaborator. AI transfers partial control of direction over learning to techers, and learners cllaborate with AI to focus on personalized leaning experience (Kory & Breazeal, 2014; Wang et al. 2022). The paradigm aligns with the human-centered design approach in the HCI field. The paradigmatic shift from an AI-centered design to a human-centered design is in line with the current emphasis on learner-centered learning (Hsieh & Lee, 2021). Human-centered design places human beings as central, with the primary objective of understanding users holistically. It involves users throughout the design proces in an involvement continuum that spans from informative, through consultative, to participative (Damodaran, 1996). A typical example is the robots with a scripted set of dialogue options that lead learners through storytelling games and adapt responses to learners' answers (Conti et al., 2020; Kory & Breazeal, 2014).

4.2.2.1. Human-AI relationship. This paradigm shows a collaborative relationship between humans and Al, in which the interaction between them is two-way, active, sharing, complementary, replaceable, adaptive, and predictale. In the collaboratie interaction, AI becomes ateammate who shares information, goals, and tas with learners (Johnson & Vera, 2019). As AI learns over time, learner-AI functions and tasks are allocaed dynamically to emphasize the complementarit of larners and Al intelligence. eachers play therole of guides who gather diagnostic information to lead students through learning by making pedagogical decisions. Teachers use the information from AI to determine what students learn, how, when, and whether students use what they have learned to target in. struction and AI resources. Teachers also incorporate their personal knowledge of students and understanding of learning contexts and teaching targets to addres particular learning needs (Kory & Breazeal, 2014). Moreover, students play an important role as collaborators who actively respond to feedback from teachers, Al, self-evaluation, and peer evaluation. Fedback in itself may not facilitate learning, unless students engage with and act upon it (Gibs & Simpson, 2005). Teachers guide students in understanding the evaluation criteria, assessing learning quality, engaging with self-evaluation and peer evaluation, and acting upon the feedback.

4.2.2.2. Key dimensions that inluence HAl. The lerning objective i to foster leaner-centered adaptive leaning, based on diagnostic information and feedack from A, teachers instruction, leners self-evaluation, or er evaluation. The common types of instruction questions asked by teachers include what is working, what o improve, and how to improve (Dixson & Worrl, 2016). ccordingly, the paradigm often uses semi-open-ended tasks, which require students to list specific facts and express their opinions based on the facts. Common semi-open-ended tasks include chatting with chatbots (Belda-Medina and Calvo-Ferr, 2022; El hazly, 2021) and story. telling with robots (Fridin, 2014; Kory & Breazeal, 2014). This paradigm has a moderate level of pre-structured interaction. Learners are expected to elaborate on their ideas to a certain extent besides giving a short and fixed response (Li et al., 2021).

4.2.2.3. Learners' engagement behavior in learning process and conitive outcomes. The mode that laners engage with Al is constructive generating. Constructive generating has been defined as the behavior exhibited by learners when they generate or produce externalized outputs that go beyond the provided learning materials (Chi & Wylie, 2014). The distinction between constructive generating and active manipulating in Paradigm One is that students can generate inferences and expres additional ideas that are not stated inthe materials, rather than the verbatim copy of what is read or heard. The inherent principles of AI-supported learning as a scalable and transferable scaffolding allow students to explore and apply what they have learned in their own words. Moreover, language develops by inference. When students use their prior knowledge and textual information to make judgments, draw conclusions, and interpret the texts in their own words, they are making inferences. Finally, cognitive outcomes in this paradigm are to transfer new knowledge to novel contexts created by AI. Teachers include various authentic learning activities, tasks, and experiences to optimize language learning (Tanaka et al., 2014).

4.2.2.4. Research focus. This body of iterature highlights understanding and interpreting language learning process in HAl to facilitate continuous learning (Conti et a., 2020; Li et al., 2021). Researchers explore participants learning experiences and the meanings they ascribe to the experiences. Researchers reflexively interpret the learning information, which is fore fronted in infor. mation analysis (Grant & Giddings, 2002). Compared to Paradigm One, Paradigm Two reles more on a phenomenological approach. Furthermore, the grounded theory approach i commonly employed, such as analyzing the research based on participants' drawings of stories told by roots (Conti e l., 2020, and oserations of the interaction process (i e al., 2021; Tanaka t al., 2014. The research is interested in investigating teachers and students hermeneutic experience, which i i turn interpreted by rearchers themselves The interaction mode among teachers, learners, and AI is exhibited in an open environment where learners learn language by constructing meaning with AI as collaborators, and teachers are either absent or present to provide support in a new situation (Bowlby, 2005), as guides who prepare students with necessary knowledge to \*play with a robot (Hsieh & Lee, 2021), or co-teach with AI (Tanaka et al., 2014).

Results showed that the collaboration between humans and AI not only improved learners' language proficiency, but also promoted their emotional involvement (Li et al., 2021). Specificll, the expressve social behaviors of robots increased the number of details learners remembered compared to the inexpressive human storyteler (onti et al., 2020). Moreover, the high degree f engagement in HAIl le students to report positive emotions in the interview and questionnaire (Hsieh & Lee, 2021). These results indicate that AI can facilitat ineractions which are open-ended in essence, and create interactie sttings to facilitate language learning (Tanaka et al., 2014).

# 4.2.3. Paradigm Three: AI/teacher/learner-codirected

The third paradigm is characterized as AI/teacher/learner-codirected. AI, teachers, and learners share control of direction over learning, fotring leaner agecy as the core of HAll. Corresponding o the human-centeredl approach, this paradigm is an extension of Paradigm Two, as it also emphasizes a learner-centered and dynamicall iterative language lerning process involving interactions between leaners and Al. The main difference in this new paradigm lies in the enhanced role of learners evolving from collaborating with AI to codirecting the learning proces with teachers and Al. The evolution of the role underlines the importance of learner agency (Ouyang & Jiao, 2021). In Paradigm Three, the four core properties of learner agency are supported: intentionality (ie, to be planners), forethought (ie, to be forthinkers, self-reactieness (i.e, to be self-regulators), and self-reflctivenes (i., to be self-examiners) (Bandura, 2006). This paradigm puts learners at the center of interaction to empower them to become agents of learning who are planning, forethinking, self-reactive, and self-reflectie. This paradigm is associated with the human-centered AI design approach in the HCI field. The human-centered AI design approach advocates using AI to amplify human abilities to se, think. create, and act in empowered ways while ensuring human control (Shneiderman, 2020), by creating potent user experience with embedded AI methods (Robert et al., 2020. This approach includes three main aspects of work interdependently: AI, human factors, and ethics (u et al., 2023). I is congruent with the \*ethically aligned design' of AI, which puts users at the center of design to build users' self-efficacy, clarify their responsibility, and facilitate their creativity (Donahoe, 2018).

4.2.3.1. Human-AI elationship. Humans and AI show a teaming relationship in the paradigm. Teachers and learners can make informed decisions about learning, based on individualized information with data accuracy and interactiveness from advanced AI technologies (Kay & Kummerfeld, 2019). In the teaming relationship, AI plays the role of an agency-supporting super tool embedded in the \*human loop' (Shneiderman, 2021). Human-in-the-l00p AI systems ensure humans to be always a part of the systems to improve when the confidence of the system output is low (Xu et al., 2023). These AI systems comply with the central decision-making role of humans. When humans, i.e., teachers and students, share the central decision-making in HAll, teachers are expected to develop learners' agency to help them become agents of language learning.

4.2.3.2. Key dimensions that influence human-AI interaction. First, the learning objective is to foster learner agency. Learner agency requires lener t assume resonsibilit in ery aset f lnig, incdig go sing, strac us f cognie skill, and active control of the thinking proces. Commonly used metacognitive strategies include planning, montoring, and evaluation (Hanon e l., 2021; Palermo & Thomson, 2018). Second, the main task type is open-ended tasks, which give learners fredom in expressing their own thoughts and chooing language. Common open-ended tasks include reflective writing about students' own learning experience (Hanlon et al., 2021), and incorporatig self-regulated strategies into argumentative writing proces (Palermo & Thomson, 2018) Third, this paradigm has a low level of pre-structured interaction. Learners are encouraged to plan, forethink, and reflect on their language learning process and make further adjustments in the next step.

4.2.3.3. Learners' engagement behavior in learming process and cognitive outcomes. The mode of students' cognitive engagement is interactive dialoguing. Intractive dioguing has two criteria: constructive utterances and a sufficient frequency of n-taking (Chi & Wylie, 2014). Provided that the criteria are met, dialoguing speakers can be Al, teachers, or peers that are involved in learning. Interactive dialoguing should first be constructive, meaning that new ideas are generated from mutual exchanges of ideas between partners, while neither individual could produce alone (Rafal, 1996). Furthermore, regarding knowledge-change proces, learners develop language by co-inference. When dialoguing learners take turns in contributing to the topic, they are co-inferring new knowledge based on feedback, alternative perspectives, or new directions. Finall, the cognitive outcomes are to co-create new knowledge, which enables language learners to generate new interpretations, perspectives, and ideas in future iterations.

4.2.3.4. Research focus. This paradigm focuses on fostering learner agency to improve language learning in HA (Hsu & Liang, 2021; Wilson & Roscoe, 2020). Researchers seek to empower learners to engage intransformative action. Since empowerment i the outcome of developed consciousness produced by the proces of praxis (Grant & Giddings, 2002) leners agency becomes the focus. Similar to Paradigm Two, this paradigm adopts the phenomenological approach with interviews, observations, and text analysis of qualitative narration. However, the difference i that the studies are much more focused on a thick decription of how students intenalize aency in HAll with critical thinking. The thick description of students' internalization of agency is examined through the critical lens of researchers (Park et al., 2011). Regarding the interaction mode of Paradigm Three, teachers create the metacognitive and critical thinking experience with assistance from Al as an agency-supporting super tool to helpstudents become agents of language learning, such as writing in automated writing evaluation systems (Palermo & Thomson, 2018), performing long-term interaction with a robot tutor in the classroom (Park et al., 2011), and using a robot to teach computational thinking, critical thinking, and language leaning (Hsu & Liang, 2021).

Findings indicate that learners' agency can potentially be reflected, practiced, and promoted in HAll for language learning. Moreover, researchers have expressed their concerns on AI ethics in conducting studies. For instance, children should be aware of the reason for learning with Al, i.e., not for Al but for themselves (Park et al., 2011), and they should be prevented from becoming emotionally attached to AI agents (Fridin, 2014). During the data collection procedure, data storage and privacy become a key ssue when intelligent chatbots are used among language learners (Belda-Medina and Calvo-Ferrer, 2022). The researchers expressed and applied AI ethics through their own lenses.

# 5. Discussion

This thematic review has mapped the current landscape of research on language learning development in HAll pecifically by examining contextual characteristics of the research and identifying research paradigms. In this section, we first address the main findings of the two research questions, and then propose implications for future research.

# 5.1. The current stage of language learning development in human-AI interaction

RQ1 focuses on contextual characteristics of research on language learning development in HAll. First the paradigmatic shift towards human-centered AI approach since 2018 is associated with an increasing research interest in exploring language learning development in HAll This is congruent with the current advocacy toward student-centered leaning. Second, many studies are located in specific geographic locations, notably Taiwan, the mainland of China, and the United States. The finding aligns with Liang et al. (2021). Third, K-12 education has been the main setting where language learning is developed in HAll The explanation may be found in the growth of using robots in K-12 education. The physical embodiment of robots provides K-12 students with social behaviors such as language application, gestures, facial expressions (Bartneck & Forlizz, 2004), and pedagogical value (Lee & Lee, 2022). Fourth, with an average sample size of about 86 leaners in each study, the research mainly leans English as the target language and integrated skills as the language domain. The finding may be due to ample opportunities to practice integrated English skills in relatively stres-free learning interaction (Wang et al., 2023) and personalized feedback for individual students in large clases (Mousalli & Cardoso, 2020). Fifth, AI has mostly been used in applications such as robots, chatbots, and automated writing evaluation systems in HAII. Other applications emerge including intelligent tutoring systems, automatic speech recognition systems, virtual realit, and Internet of Things intelligent image. Finall, most studies focus on individual use of an Al, for the individualized and interactive feedback for different leaners (Ai, 2017). In some studies a group of leners interact with an AI, because the AI has the potential to facilitate human communication with the affordances of Al-mediated interaction (Hancock et al., 2020). Future research may explore inter-group use of AIs to optimize language learning across groups of learners via various AI applications.

5.2. Research paradigms of language learning development in human-AI interaction: From competing to supplementing

For RQ2, this study identifies three research paradigms of language learning development in HAI: Paradigm One (AI-directed. teacher-as-facilitator, learner-a-recipient), Paradigm Two (AI/teacher-codirected, leaner-as-collaborator), and Paradigm Thre (I/ teacher/learner-codirected). The three paradigms exhibit the human-AI relationship from stimulus-response, collaboration, to teaming, based on specificall designed tasks in interaction, different modes of engagement behaviors and cognitive outcomes, and various research foci. When the three paradigms are compared and contrasted, the aforementioned sharp differences between their constructs have been identified to be rooted in competing philosophical and linguisic underpinnings. Despite the competing underpinnings, the three paradigms supplement each other in research.

# 5.2.1. Competing philosophical and linguistic underpinnings

The diffrences between constructs of paradigms are rooted in competing philosophical and linguistic underpinnings. Philosophically, Paradigm One differ from the others because it is based on positivism. Positivism views that truth is composed of a single tangible reality that can be identified and measured, and knowledge should be developed objectively without the influence of researchers or participants values (Park et al., 2020). This philosophical underpinning resonates linguistically with Universal Grammar (UG) Theory, which proposes that there isa universal grammar for all languages sharing basic principles, and humans are endowed with some language acquistion deviceto decode the language-specific structural settings (De Bot et al. 2013). According todifferent components of ingustic variations, AI is being developed to corrspond to the components in core grammar to create learning experiences.

Paradigm Two is philosophicall grounded in phenomenology with its focus on understanding various realities and allowing meanings to emerge in interaction with a particular situation with participants' own interpretation and mediation from other factors (Grundy, 1987). The inclusion of language learning with instead of from learning environments involves interaction among teachers, students, and AI, so new knowledge i incorporated into prior knowledge rather than being compartmentalized passively. The linguistic underpinning of this paradigm i the constructivist approach that considers language learning as a process in which leaners construct new knowledge by integrating new information into their prior knowledge (Behrens, 2021). Maximization of constructive learning occurs when learners increase information gathering, which stimulates internal events in learners' mind (Kaufman, 2004).

In Paradigm Three, critical theory provides the philosophical underpinning to develop self-knowledge through critical elf reflection (Bullough & Goldstein, 1984). Knowledge is learned through critical reflection, which leads to a perspective transformation or transformed consciousness (Mezirow, 1981). Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) illuminates the linguistic foundation ofthis paradigm, which views language as a dynamic system wherein components interact over time, and language develops in a dynamic process (De Bot et al. 007). According to DST, learners' language system is i constant flux with its numerous subsystems, and individual differences at a given point of time influence language lerning. Therefore, language lerning does not have an end state, but instead involves a reflection of the boundless potentiality, so learner agency emerges from the interactions and itrations among language learning components (Larsen-Freeman, 2006).

# 5.2.2. Supplementing each other in research

Despite competing philosophical and linguistic underpinnings of the paradigms, the boundaries are blurry in practice, as both continuities and ruptures mark the boundaries among paradigms (Grant & Giddings, 2002). In research the three paradigms supplement each other with their own values.In Paradigm One, passive learning is necessary for allowing leners to generate hypotheses about the domain knowledge, which they could test in active learning (MacDonald & Frank, 2016). The dispute is to avoid over. emphasis on test outcomes and judgment prediction since researchers diferent implementations in research may have strong impacts on test outcomes (Cheung & Slavin, 2016), and judgment prediction should not be solely based on the measurable variables, neglecting the interdependency of variables and the context of the study for acomprehensive and deep understanding (Burgelman, 2011. Instead of viewing objectivity and prediction in this paradigm as universal standards, reearchers are expected to recognize the complexity and context of learning experiences.

Although Paradigm Two is subject to critique for the dominant purpose of understanding, i can be considered as an information source for two other paradigms (Liu & Yin, 2022). Understanding how language learning develops in the AI-supported educational environment provides insights into how teachers and learners may influence and be influenced by various factors as shown in Paradigm One. Furthermore, based on these understandings and potential influences, critical self-reflection can be conducted to examine how to beter develop learner agency in the Al-supported educational environment, thereby informing Paradigm Three.

While Paradigm Thre has not been full fulfilled yet, it could be considered as a further purpose for two other paradigms (Ouyang & Jiao, 2021). A major challenge in Paradigm Thre is to address the complexity ofaligning the intricacie of the learning proces with

AI technologies across diverse educational contexts. To respond to this challenge, i is necesary to integrate pedagogical, social cultural, economic, and ethical dimensions during the AI application process (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). Paradigm One and Paradigm Two offr valuabl insights into identifying inluencing factors and understanding how the factors interact witheach other within broader educational contexts, towards the ultimate goal of applying Al to enhance learner agency in language learning for Paradigm Three.

Given the possibilities of supplementation among the three paradigms, researchers have supplementary methodological choices across these paradigms. On the one hand, because each paradigm is undergirded by specific philosophical and linguistic underpinnings as discsd earlier, choice of a paradm implies that the rearch will be nested in particular underpinning, and this orienttion ill therefore guide the research towards particular methodologies.In Paradigm One, the data gathered are quantitative in nature, and are likely to be analyzed with quantitive procedures, e.g., experimental, quasi-experimental, and corrlation methodologies. Paradigm Two often uses phenomenological approaches involving methods such as interviews, observations, and text analysi to stay close to the participants' descriptions of their experiences. Paradigm Thre often uses phenomenological approaches with critical analysis. On the other hand, several research methodologies between paradigms can supplement each ther in addresing a part of the question at hand (Kivunja & Kuyini, 2017). When each methodology provides a perspective that i the opposit ofthe other, a bigger question involves finding ways to integrate the partial images of reality into a new perspective. The key i to ask which question is more significant to have solved (Rist, 197). Therefore, researchers may choose appropriate methodologies to answer their reearch questions after being informed by a good understanding of different constructs of research paradigms discussed in this study.

# 5.3. Implications for future research

Our findings indicate implications for future research. First, HAll has demonstrated the potential to support language learning development. As to sample groups, with the adances of Al, its evolving affordances and ethical concerns, it is beoming signficant to explore the nes f leners at varousdctional leels andwthdiffen sociocoomic sttses abilitie, and dentt expresions (Estes et al. 2020). Regarding the target language, research to date has focused on English language learning. Future research may consider investigating other languages. The under-researched language domains of listening, reading, writing, pronunciation, and grammar are also worth exploring. As for AI-supported interaction types, researchers may explore inter-group use of Als to optimize language learning between groups of learners via various AI applications. Concerning language learning proces, future studies may investigate how t pedagogically design and implement the HAll pocessto facilitate language learning, and ow learning construction should occr in the process (Chai & Kong, 2017), such as how language learners comprehend AI input, negotiate meaning, and produce output in various types of interaction (e.g., turn taking, mechanisms of meaning repair, and opening and closing of topics).

Second, regarding how researchers and teachers may draw on the three paradigms to promote language learning in HAll they are encouraged to explore various methodological possbilites and appropriatenes acording to research questions. The boundaries of the paradigms ae blurr in practice. The most important touchstone is to understand positions, reearch purposes, beliefs, and values, and then chooe the research methodologies that bestaddressthe research questions (Cheung & Slavin, 2016; Grant & Giddings, 2002) This review provides the research landscape for researchers and teachers to gain such understandings.

# 6. Limitations

Three limitations should be acknowledged. First, the computer-supported proces-oriented interaction framework and the engagement framework guided our initial analysis and coding, so the content of analysis was preset by the classfication and coding scheme, though an open coding process was inductively performed afterward to address hs limtation. Second, studies that lacked the neessary information to describe studies and report findings (What Works Clearinghouse, 2021), or that were written in languages other than English, might not have been identified. Third,categorization of the thr paradigms enables a means of classfying research based on the main reearch focus and findings though this might have led to glossing over the uniquenes of certain studies. This risk was expected to be mitigated by providing a coherent overview of this multidisciplinary field and identifying the common rot in philosophical and linguistic underpinnings.

# 7. Conclusion

This study's primary purposes and contributions are to investigate contextual characteristics of research on language learning development in HAlI and identify research paradigms. When directing language learning practice researchers and teachers may be faced with confusion and misunderstanding due to different rearch paradigms of language learning development in HA. In response to the need to better understand contextual characteristics of the research and research paradigms, we have examined human-AI relationship, learning objective, task type, level of pre-structuring, mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change proces, cognitive outcomes, and reearch focus. Moreover, we have revealed philoophical and linguistic underpinnings for each paradigm. No single paradigm emerges as superior to another for the reearch. Rather, findings resultig from reearch in each paradigm are sought and valued due to the contribution in describing, understanding, and creating new knowledge for language learning development in HAIl. HAll has shown promising potential to improve language learning. This study serves as a foundation for the research orientation on language learning development in HAll by gaining inights into the current contextual characteristics of the research and research paradigms, and providing future research implications.
