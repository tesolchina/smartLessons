Dear Dr Wang,

# General Adjustment under the New Pay and Reward Structure 2018

I am pleased to inform you that the University Council has approved the provision of a general adjustment of salaries for alleligible full-time staff under the New Pay and Reward Structure (NPRS) with effect from 1 July 2018 subject to the implementation guidelines as detailed in Personnel Office Circular No. 3/2018, which can be viewed on the Homepage of the Personnel Office..

2. In accordance with the Council's resolution, the University will adjust your basic salary as follows:

Adjusted Basic Salary HK\$37,680/month

With effect from. 1 July 2018

(Contract Ref.:1712686)

3. General adjustment is a feature under the NPRS. At the time of adopting the NPRS, the University committed that in the event where the Government implements any pay adjustment for the Civil Service and provides a "supplementary grant' to the University to reflect the level of salary increase in funding allocations, the University will utilize the entire "supplementary grant' for the purpose of providing a general adjustment of salaries for staff. However, as the amount of supplementary grant is calculated on the basis of staff cost frozen in 2003, it is actually not adequate for the University to provide for the same level of salary increase as that in the Civil Service in subsequent years..

4. In approving the general adjustment under the NPRS in 2018, the Council has taken into consideration the University's pay policy under the NPRS, financial viability, market competitiveness and staff morale, and agrees that by adopting 1 July as the implementation date for the general adjustment under the NPRS, the University could afford to provide slightly higher percentages of salary increase for staff in 2018. In so doing, the University will incur additional annual staff costs from both UGC-funds and non-UGC funds. The University will keep the financial situation under careful review, and will consider conscientiously in subsequent years if it should provide a general adjustment which is lower than, the same as, or higher than that in the Civil Service, having regard to all the relevant factors at the time of decision.

5. If you have any enquiries, please contact colleagues in the Personnel Office who are servicing your Faculty/School/Office.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours sincerely,.
