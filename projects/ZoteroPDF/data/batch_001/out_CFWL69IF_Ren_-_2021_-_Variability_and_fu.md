Lexical bundles perform discourse functions and present differing levels of variability, with some slots replaceable by optional words. Incorporating both function and formulaicity perspectives is a promising approach to uncover certain features of these recurrent language patterns. Based on the variability measurement and functional taxonomy proposed by Biber (2009) and Biber et al. (2004), this study compared the extent to which the lexical bundles from research articles of applied linguistics and pharmaceutical sciences are fixed. Thereafter, the lexical bundles were examined across the discourse functions to explore the possible interaction between function and variability. The results indicate that variability shows disciplinary variation, with bundles from applied linguistics articles as a whole being relatively less fixed. In addition, discourse functions are found to be closely associated with variability. These findings shed light on the question of whether lexical bundles are prefabricated patterns and may facilitate the teaching of academic writing at the graduate level.

# 1. Introduction

Recurrent combinations of lexical items have been shown functionally significant in both spoken and written academic discourses (Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010). These frequent strings of multiple words are also referred to as multi-word sequences (Biber et al., 2004). They can be extracted from a corpus as either continuous (e.g., it is likely that) or discontinuous units (e.g., in the $^ *$ of, where \* represents a variable slot that could be substantiated by an optional word). When also meeting the dispersion criterion across the separate texts of a corpus, the frequent and continuous multi-word sequences are called “lexical bundles” by Biber and Conrad (1999). Meanwhile, the recurrent discontinuous sequences that contain variable slots at the internal or boundary positions have been investigated under terms like “frameworks” (Renouf & Sinclair, 1991, pp. 128e143), “phrase frames (p-frames)” (Romer, 2010 € ) and “formulaic frames” (Biber, 2009). Generally, a formulaic frame could be defined as a discontinuous multi-word sequence that is composed of relatively fixed words as the “frame”, and variable words as the “fillers”.

So far, most studies of lexical bundles have focused on the specific discourse functions in different registers (e.g., Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Biber et al., 2004) and academic disciplines (e.g., Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008; Le & Harrington, 2015; Pan et al., 2016; Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010; Wood & Appel, 2014). Studies of formulaic frames, however, have centered on the internal variability of the fillers for these frameworks (e.g., Biber, 2009; Cheng et al., 2009; Cunningham, 2017; Gray & Biber, 2013; Marco, 2000; Wang, 2019). The internal variability generally reflects the likelihood of a formulaic frame to take certain words as fillers and can be measured in different approaches (see Section 1.1 for a brief review of different measurements of internal variability). Due to the close connection between lexical bundles and formulaic frames, we suppose that combining the functional analysis with the variability examination might uncover some ignored properties of lexical bundles. As Hyland (2012) notes, the phraseological variation of lexical bundles in academic writing is yet to be fully explored.

The use of lexical bundles presents disciplinary variations (Hyland, 2008), so instructors of graduate EAP and ESP writing courses need lists of discipline-specific bundles to acquaint the students with the language of various specialized discourse communities (Cunningham, 2017). Studies of lexical bundles used in the discourse of History and Biology (Cortes, 2004), Arts, Commerce, Law and Science (Byrd & Coxhead, 2010), Physics (Farvardin et al., 2012), Mathematics (Cunningham, 2017), Linguistics (Le & Harrington, 2015), and Education (Candarli & Jones, 2019) have substantially advanced our understanding about the disciplinary differences in bundle use. But lexical bundles in research articles of pharmaceutical sciences seem to be understudied. We here propose that a comparative study of lexical bundles used in the research articles of pharmaceutical sciences and applied linguistics might be valuable for the relevant L2 novice academic writers and their instructors. Pharmacy education is a global enterprise nowadays, so a huge number of L2 novice academic writers, especially graduate students, need to understand the conventional use of language within this special community1 . Meanwhile, many instructors with a background in linguistics are actively involved in designing and teaching L2 academic writing. Thus, they are likely to be most familiar with the linguistic features of research articles in applied linguistics2 . Therefore, a comparative study taking the applied linguistics as the background may assist instructors in explaining with ease the disciplinary variations of lexical bundles to L2 novice academic writers.

# 1.1. Identifying and comparing formulaic frames

Early studies on discontinuous multi-word sequences often adopt a corpus-based approach under which the formulaic frames are selected in advance and then searched in a corpus to obtain all the collocates (fillers) for the variable slot. Renouf and Sinclair (1991, pp. 128e143) chose six discontinuous pairings as the target frameworks (i.e., $a + ? +$ of, $a n { + } ? { + }$ of, $b e + ? + t o ,$ , $t o o \pm$ $? + t o$ , for $+ ? + o f ,$ $t o o { + } ? { + } t o$ , where ? represents an optional filler) and observed their realizations in corpus. Two indicators were used for comparing the internal variability of these frameworks. The first one is the ratio of the occurrences of a framework to the types of different collocates. A higher framework/type ratio means that relatively fewer collocates are actually selected, thus reflects a higher probability of co-selecting the framework and the fillers as an integral unit. The second indicator is the ratio of the occurrences of a token appearing as a collocate to its total occurrences in the corpus. The higher collocate/token ratio indicates that the framework promotes the chance for the token to occur in the corpus. This study concludes that frameworks exert specific constraints on the collocates. Marco (2000) also adopted the framework/type ratio as the variability indicator and examined three frameworks, that is, the $^ *$ of, be $^ *$ to, and $a ^ { * }$ of, in medical research articles. This study confirms the roles played by frameworks in the construction of medical discourse. Specifically, these three frameworks were more likely to be used for constructing nominalization, quantifying and categorizing, and expressing cause or similarity, respectively.

In recent studies, target frameworks are not inputted manually but are derived automatically from continuous multi-word combinations. Because both the continuous and discontinuous multi-word sequences are discovered from the corpus rather than pre-selected by researchers, such studies are corpus-driven. Fletcher (2006) offered a model in which continuous multiword sequences (n-grams) are automatically extracted according to frequency and length criteria, and then phrase frames are automatically searched as “sets of variants of an n-gram identical except for one word”. Romer (2010) € proposed a phraseological profile model (PP model) to investigate the variability of the phrase frames (p-frames) in book reviews. This model comprises four steps: (1) identifying the n-grams (continuous multi-word sequences) based on frequency; (2) determining the p-frames that differ from an n-gram by one word (e.g., $\mathsf { A } ^ { * } \mathbb { C } \mathsf { D }$ and $\mathsf { A B } ^ { * } \mathsf { D }$ for the n-gram ABCD, where \* indicates any word that is different from the counterpart slot in ABCD); (3) examining the functions of the identified n-grams and p-frames; (4) analyzing the item distribution across the text. For determining the variability of a p-frame, the variant/p-frame ratio (VPR) is calculated, where “variant” represents the number of different fillers, and “p-frame” refers to the total occurrences of that frame. For instance, if two fillers are identified for the p-frame on the \* hand that occurs 800 times in a corpus, the VPR would be $0 . 2 5 \%$ . A lower VPR indicates a higher probability for a p-frame to be combined with its fillers. Adopting a similar procedure to the PP model, Cunningham (2017) extracted the most frequent continuous multi-word sequences, derived the phrase frames by clustering similar sequences that differed only by one word, and examined the discourse functions of the frames in mathematical research articles. Instead of VPR, this study used the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) to identify the most frequent frames. Generally, sMAPE is a number calculated as (Ftarget - Fgeneral)/((Ftarget $^ +$ Fgeneral)/2), where

Ftarget and Fgeneral represent the occurrences of a frame in the study corpus and a more general corpus (for instance, a specialized corpus of mathematical research articles and the Corpus of Contemporary American English), respectively.

In a study of formulaic frames, Biber (2009) extracted four-word lexical bundles based on frequency and dispersion criteria and then measured how fixed each slot in the bundles was. For measuring the variability of a slot, the occurrence of the lexical bundle is divided by the occurrence of all four-word combinations that are identical in the other three slots. For instance, which is consistent with might be identified as a lexical bundle with a total occurrence of 21 per million words. In the same corpus, there might be this is consistent with and that is consistent with appearing together 9 times per million words. In this case, which accounts for $7 0 \%$ of all the occurrences of the three-word combination is consistent with. This percentage number was taken as an indicator of the variability of the slot which. An arbitrary cut-off of $5 0 \%$ was set to distinguish a fixed slot from a variable one. Generally, all these studies adopted a “bundle-to-frame” procedure, extracting continuous multi-word sequences first and proceeding to the associated discontinuous formulaic frames. However, a recent study by Gray and Biber (2013) skipped over the “bundle identification” step and extracted lexical frames directly according to the frequency and dispersion criteria. Because one free element (e.g., $\mathsf { A B } ^ { * } \mathsf { D }$ ) is allowed in the initial identification, this method generates more lexical frames than the “bundle-to-frame” procedure does.

# 1.2. Discourse functions of multi-word sequences

Functions of lexical bundles have been investigated under several systematic and comprehensive taxonomies. Biber et al. (2004) established a general taxonomy to encompass the functions of four-word lexical bundles identified from classroom teaching and textbook corpora. They proposed that lexical bundles are used as stance expressions, discourse organizers, or referential expressions. Stance bundles refer to the epistemic status of information (e.g., the fact that the) or the manifestation of attitude/modality (e.g., to be able to). Discourse organizers introduce a topic (e.g., let’s have a look) or clarify a topic by providing further explanations (e.g., has to do with). Referential bundles mark out one entity as deserving further description (e.g., is one of the) or foreground certain attributes of an entity (e.g., the size of the, the extent to which). The taxonomy by Byrd and Coxhead (2010) also places bundles under three rubrics: (a) the presentation of content, (b) the creation of connections within the text, and (c) the expression of attitudes by the writer. Hyland (2008) proposed a classification system that gathers lexical bundles into three macro-functions pertinent to research, text, and participants. Research-oriented bundles are used to report the activities in the real world (e.g., at the beginning of). Text-oriented bundles are employed to coordinate the elements of the text (e.g., on the other hand, these results suggest that). Participant-oriented bundles center on the writers or readers of the text (e.g., may be due to, should be noted that). Despite the different specific terms, interlinks can be found among these three taxonomies. For example, stance bundles overlap largely with participant-oriented bundles and expressions of attitudes; most discourse organizers can be placed under text-oriented bundles or text connectors; referential bundles are likely to be the same expressions as those called content presentation bundles or research-oriented bundles. Many discipline- or register-based studies of lexical bundles have referred to these classification systems (e.g., Candarli & Jones, 2019; Cortes, 2006; Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010; Wood & Appel, 2014; Wright, 2019).

Instead of adopting one systematic functional taxonomy, some studies investigated the discourse functions of multi-word sequences in an inductive fashion. Le and Harrington (2015) examined how the recurrent sequences containing 3 to 6 words are used to interpret, compare, and account for results in applied linguistics research articles. Durrant & Mathews-Aydinli, 2011 explored the recurring patterns used to indicate the structure (IS) of social science writings. Cunningham (2017) showed that many formulaic frames in mathematical research articles are used in the specific move which establishes assumptions. The association between lexical bundles and the rhetorical purposes of different sections in an IMRD format article has also been confirmed by the studies of Shahriari (2017) and Le and Harrington (2015).

# 2. Research questions

These previous “bundle-to-frame” studies have shown the variability of the component slots in lexical bundles. And the analyses of discourse functions have confirmed the disciplinary variations in use. Incorporating variability examination and function analysis may uncover certain ignored features of these recurrent language patterns. In addition, given the large number of pharmaceutical learners worldwide and the linguistics background of many writing course instructors, a comparative study of the lexical bundles used in applied linguistics and pharmaceutical sciences could be useful for instructors to explain and for students to understand the disciplinary use of lexical bundles.

The current study compares the variability of lexical bundles across two academic disciplines and three discourse functions. The results are valuable for determining to what extent lexical bundles can be regarded as prefabricated constituents as well as for introducing discipline-based bundles to apprentice writers in relevant academic disciplines. Specifically, this study seeks answers to three questions:

(1) What lexical bundles can be identified from research articles in applied linguistics and pharmaceutical sciences? (2) To what extent are these lexical bundles fixed or variable across the two academic disciplines? (3) To what extent are these lexical bundles fixed or variable across the three discourse functions?

# 3. Methods

Two disciplinary corpora were prepared for this study. The subsequent process involved four steps:(1) identifying the lexical bundles from each corpus; (2) measuring the variability of each slot in these lexical bundles; (3) comparing the formulaic status of the lexical bundles across the disciplines; and (4) exploring the interaction between the discourse functions and the formulaic status of the lexical bundles.

# 3.1. Identifying lexical bundles from two corpora

The two corpora used in this study are collections of research articles in pharmaceutical sciences and applied linguistics, all published from 2014 to 2019 in scholarly journals (Table 1). The corpus of applied linguistics (LingC) consists of 200 texts, 1,803,661 tokens, and that of pharmaceutical sciences (PharmC) contains 200 texts, 1,416,993 tokens. Source journals for LingC are Journal of English for Academic Purposes (JEAP), English for Specific Purposes (ESP), Journal of Second Language Writing (JSLW), and System (SYS). Source journals for PharmC are Cancer Discovery (CANC), Cell (CELL), Genes and Development (GENE), and Microbiome (MICR). The pharmaceutical sciences research articles were selected from these journals by a specific query condition in the Web of Science database3 . Only the main bodies of the retrieved articles were retained when the PDF documents were converted into plain texts, while the abstracts, footnotes, tables, figures, and references were all removed. It has been shown that research paradigms and article types could influence the linguistic features of research articles (Candarli & Jones, 2019; Gray, 2015; Hu & Cao, 2015). In compiling the two corpora, we selected only empirical research articles from each discipline. However, subtle differences exist in the specific research methods of the two disciplines. Studies in PharmC obtain data from experimental methods, while those in LingC derive data mainly from corpora, questionnaires, surveys, or interviews. Fifty-eight studies in LingC could even be coded as purely qualitative research that did not involve any statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques. Such differences should be considered when explaining the results of the current study.

Although we extracted all the four-, five- and six-word sequences, only four-word lexical bundles were taken into account in the current study so as to make the investigation manageable. The threshold frequency for a continuous multi-word sequence to be considered was set at 20 times per million words (Cortes, 2004; Cunningham, 2017; Hyland, 2008), a less conservative standard than that adopted by many studies. The frequent multi-word sequences were then checked in each text to ensure that they occurred in at least five texts (Biber, 2009; Biber et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2016). By observing the five- and six-word lexical bundles, we detected and manually removed the four-word lexical bundles that were actually components of longer bundles.

# 3.2. Measuring variability and determining discourse functions

To compare the extent to which the obtained four-word bundles are fixed, we measured how variable each slot is. Following the frequency-based approach proposed by Biber (2009), we compared each lexical bundle (e.g., ABCD) with all the four-word combinations in the corpus to detect those that might differ from the bundle by one word (e.g., _BCD, where “_” could be but not necessarily be A). By calculating the ratio of the occurrences of the lexical bundle to the total occurrences of the four-word sequences that might differ from it by one word, we determined to what extent the associated three-word combination (i.e., BCD) could be accounted for by the fourth word (i.e., A). Following Biber (2009), the cut-off percentage for distinguishing a variable slot from a fixed one was set at $5 0 \%$ . Therefore, if the ratio of ABCD to _BCD is no more than $5 0 \%$ , A would be marked as a variable slot (represented by $^ *$ ). According to the location and number of variable slots, we assigned different variable patterns to the lexical bundles.

Fig. 1. Pipeline of extracting and comparing lexical bundles by NLTK.

The functional taxonomy was adapted from the classification system developed by Biber et al. (2004) and Biber and Barbieri (2007). While maintaining the classification of bundles as (1) stance expressions, (2) discourse organizers, or (3) referential expressions, this study added and removed specific sub-types under each umbrella function to make the taxonomy appropriate for analyzing lexical bundles extracted from the current disciplinary corpora. Most lexical bundles are multifunctional, so the classification in the current study was based on the most frequent function performed by a bundle.

# 3.3. Extracting and analyzing lexical bundles with NLTK

The extraction and analysis of lexical bundles were accomplished using the functions and methods of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a third-party library of Python language (Fig. 1). As the pipeline shows, in step 1, the plain texts were converted into a corpus by the PlaintextCorpusReader () function. In step 2, all the individual texts in the corpus were concatenated into one single text. The whole single text was then split into individual tokens (word_tokenize ()) which were subsequently changed into lowercase (string.lower ()) and appended into a word list (list.append ()). Italicized words (e.g., list) indicate the object types of the methods. In step 3, the word list was sliced into multi-word combinations (ngrams ()), the occurrences of which was calculated by FreqDist (). Here, the parameters of the ngrams () function were set to be 4, 5, and 6 so as to identify the sequences of different lengths. In step 4, the multi-word sequences were selected according to the frequency number obtained in step 3. The multi-word sequences with a frequency of no less than 20 per million words were then checked in each text obtained in step 1 to get the lexical bundles that appeared in at least 5 separate texts in the corpus. At the end of this step, four-word lexical bundles that are actually components of longer bundles were removed manually. In step 5, each four-word lexical bundle was compared with all the four-word combinations obtained in step 3 so as to measure the variability of each slot.

# 4. Results and discussion

This section presents and discusses the findings of the formulaic status of the lexical bundles across academic disciplines and discourse functions. We first describe to what extent the LingC and PharmC rely on relatively fixed bundles, that is, bundles variable in zero or only one slot. We proceed to compare the variability of lexical bundles under the general discourse functions. Based on these results, we look into concordance lines to illustrate the specific functions and variability of some typical lexical bundles.

# 4.1. Variability of lexical bundles across corpora

Based on the frequency and distribution criteria, we identified 75 and 73 different lexical bundles from LingC and PharmC, respectively. The normalized occurrences are 2701 times per million words and 2517 times per million words. Measuring the variability of each slot generated 13 variable patterns depending on the number and position of variable slots (Fig. 2). It can be seen that the variable patterns of lexical bundles in both the corpora overlap with each other, except $\mathsf { A B } ^ { * * }$ and $^ { * * * * } \mathsf { D }$ which are not shared.

The finding that LingC and PharmC use almost an equal number of lexical bundles occurring at similar total frequencies indicate that lexical bundles are universal building blocks of academic texts; and that the proportion of tokens accounted for by four-word lexical bundles in research articles tends to be equal and stable (slightly more than $1 \%$ in the current study) in each disciplinary corpus of research articles. In addition, the thirteen variable patterns show that lexical bundles differ in levels of formulaicity. Biber (2009) pointed out that four-word lexical bundles present a continuous space of variation in the degree of fixedness. Romer (2010) € also found that variable slots could occur in any position of a phraseological frame composed of 3-to-6 words. Consistent with these reports, only a fraction of the lexical bundles in the current study are idiomlike expressions that are always used as an integral unit (i.e., the ABCD pattern). Most lexical bundles are variable in one or more slots, thus could be seen as composites of fixed formulaic frames and relatively variable collocates. However, the finding that over half of the lexical bundles are variable in zero or only one slot suggests a strong tendency for the component elements to be co-selected.

Fig. 2. Distribution of lexical bundles across variable patterns in LingC and PharmC

To get a clearer overview of the disciplinary differences, we further classified the 13 variable patterns into four formulaic types: (1) bundles variable in zero slot (i.e., ABCD); (2) bundles variable in one slot (i.e., $\mathsf { A B C ^ { * } }$ , $* \mathtt { B C D }$ , $\mathsf { A B } ^ { * } \mathsf { D }$ , $\mathsf { A } ^ { * } \mathbb { C } \mathsf { D }$ ); (3) bundles variable in two slots (i.e., $\mathsf { A B } ^ { * * }$ , ${ } ^ { * } \mathrm { { B C } ^ { * } }$ , $^ { * * } \mathbf { C D }$ , $\mathsf { A } ^ { * } \mathsf { C } ^ { * }$ , $\mathsf { A } ^ { * * } \mathsf { D }$ , ${ } ^ { * } \mathrm { \mathbf { B } ^ { * } \mathrm { \mathbf { D } } } \mathrm { \dot { \Omega } }$ ); and (4) bundles variable in three slots (i.e., $^ { * * } \mathbb { C } ^ { * }$ , $^ { * * * * } { } \plus ^ { } )$ . Accordingly, the level of “fixedness” declines along with the increase in variable slots. While bundles belonging to the first and second types could be regarded as “highly fixed” and “moderately fixed”, the other types might be taken as “less fixed” and “non-formulaic”.

Table 2 shows the actual and expected normalized counts of different formulaic types in LingC and PharmC, with adjusted residuals attached at the bottom. PharmC shows higher reliance on the relatively fixed lexical bundles (i.e., bundles variable in zero or one slot) than LingC does. Although there is not a significant difference between LingC and PharmC in terms of the number of lexical bundles belonging to each formulaic type $\mathbf { \tilde { p } } = 0 . 1 2 2$ , Fisher’s exact test), the normalized occurrences of lexical bundles are significantly different in these two corpora $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 3 ) = 1 4 5 . 9 6 3$ , ${ \sf p } = 0 . 0 0 0$ , Cramer’s $\mathsf { V } = 0 . 1 6 7$ ). The absolute values of adjusted residuals are all larger than 2, indicating that the differences are statistically significant. Non-variable-slot and one-variable-slot bundles are overused in the PharmC (with the adjusted residuals being 2.2 and 9.7, respectively), while two-variable-slots and three-variable-slots bundles are overused in LingC (with the adjusted residuals being 9.9 and 5.2 respectively). Specifically, $1 7 . 9 \%$ and $5 1 . 9 \%$ of the total occurrences in PharmC are bundles variable in zero or one slot, with bundles variable in two or three variable slots contributing $3 0 . 2 \%$ . In contrast, $1 5 . 7 \%$ and $3 8 . 5 \%$ of the total occurrences in LingC are contributed by the highly or moderately fixed bundles, with less fixed and non-formulaic bundles comprising the remaining $4 6 . 9 \%$ occurrences.

a"None" indicates that no slot accounts for less than $5 0 \%$ occurrences of the asociated three-word combination. bHighly" indicates that lexical bundles can be regarded as highly fixed.

If all language indeed exhibits a certain degree of formulaicity (Nattinger & DeCarrico, 1992; Schmitt & Carter, 2004, pp. 1e22; Sinclair, 2008), the lexical bundles seem to be more formulaic in pharmaceutical sciences than in applied linguistics. This difference may be related to the fact that pharmaceutical studies generally belong in the hard sciences. Hyland (2008) suggests that, due to the linear and problem-oriented approach to knowledge construction of hard sciences, arguments rely on standardized and almost shorthand expressions to a higher degree than in the soft sciences. Consistent with the argument that language as a whole presents lower variation in the hard sciences than in the soft sciences, lexical bundles as linguistic constituents also seem to be subject to lower variability in PharmC than in LingC.

# 4.2. Functions and variability of the lexical bundles

Apart from the disciplinary differences described in 4.1, the formulaic status of lexical bundles also differs across the discourse functions. Here, we are especially concerned about the three major functions: stance expressions, discourse organizers, and referential expressions.

As shown in Fig. 3(a), within LingC, referential expressions are the dominant type, comprising 47 different bundles. Next come discourse organizers and stance expressions, which are represented by 16 and 9 lexical bundles, respectively. Within PharmC, 9 lexical bundles are stance expressions, while there are 30 discourse organizers, one more than the number of referential expressions. The cross-corpora comparison reveals that LingC, compared with PharmC, contains far more referential expressions but substantially fewer discourse organizers. In terms of the formulaic types, the relatively fixed lexical bundles (i.e., bundles variable in zero or one slot) constitute approximately $5 6 \%$ and $7 5 \%$ of the stance expressions and discourse organizers respectively in LingC, and $78 \%$ and $7 9 \%$ of the stance expressions and referential expressions in PharmC. A comparison between Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows that the normalized occurrences of different formulaic types are generally proportional to the number of lexical bundles belonging to each type. However, two exceptional cases should be noted concerning the highly fixed bundles. First, although the number of non-variable-slot discourse organizers in LingC is one less than that in PharmC (3e4), the normalized occurrences in the former are almost double those in the latter (236e123). Second, an equal number of non-variable-slot referential expressions are used in LingC and PharmC (2e2), but the normalized occurrences in the former are almost double those in the latter (159e80). These two exceptions indicate that some nonvariable-slot bundles might have been used extraordinarily frequently as discourse organizers and referential expressions in LingC. All these differences might be better explained by analyzing the specific bundles realizing each function.

# 4.2.1. Stance expressions

The stance expressions in this study are lexical bundles used either to evaluate the status of knowledge (i.e., epistemic stance) or to state the ability/desire to achieve certain results (i.e., attitude/modality stance). All the stance expressions identified from LingC and PharmC are presented in Table 3.

Epistemic stance bundles. In each corpus, there are two epistemic bundles used to denote the speculative nature of the coming message, all employing the hedging adjectives POSSIBLE or LIKELY. As for the grammatical structure, all these four speculation bundles incorporate either clause fragments or verb-phrase fragments. The bundle it is possible that is a shared stance expression. Concordance lines show that this bundle is used mainly to connect established theories or observations with the authors’ attempted explanations or conclusions, as shown in the following samples:

1. As reported in Staples (2014), IENs used fewer discourse markers, and it is possible that repetition performs a similar function in this context. (LingC) 2. Based on data obtained with other anticancer therapies based on kinase inhibitors, it is possible that other mechanisms of resistance to entrectinib could occur, including activation of parallel pathways able to bypass TRKA inhibition. (PharmC)

The other epistemic stances are used to confirm the validity (i.e., credibility or trustworthiness) of the information that follows. LingC mainly relies on noun-phrase-based bundles with FACT as the head, while PharmC employs verb-phrase-based bundles with SHOW/FIND as the head. This distinction reflects different levels of confidence in the truth of assertions: the noun FACT assumes that the following information has already been well-established and is unquestionable, while the verbs SHOW/FIND imply that the credibility of the following claim depends on specific evidence. Concordance lines also show that PharmC texts often have explicit in-text citations (author-date or number system) near the validity bundles to acknowledge the specific sources, while the LingC texts rarely modify the word FACT with in-text citations, as the following samples show:

3. Inhibition of PI3K signaling has been shown to activate MAP-kinase signaling at early time-points through receptor tyrosine kinase activation (18, 19). (PharmC)   
4. These studies point to the fact that the motivations and needs of English as an Additional Language (EAL) scholars vary across disciplinary contexts. (LingC)

LingC also contains a validity bundle in the form of an existential-sentence fragment (i.e., that there is $a$ ). Interestingly, concordance lines show that this bundle is often used to claim the existence of, among numerous qualified candidates, difference/relationship between two entities, as in:

5. This demonstrates, therefore, that there is a considerable difference between the academic vocabularies needed for receptive and productive purposes. (LingC)

Attitude/modality bundles. The attitude/modality bundles in LingC and PharmC are expressions about ability and intention. All the identified stance/modality bundles contain verbs, but the two corpora have different agents to match these bundles. Concordance lines show that bundles from PharmC often have the first-person-plural pronoun WE as the agent of the clausal structure (e.g., to determine whether the), while those from LingC seldom match explicitly with WE. The following samples may illustrate the distinct preference:

6. With these clusters, we were able to identify features of the microbial communities that differentiated the three groups. (PharmC)   
7. In order to determine whether the liver morphology had an impact on liver function, we analyzed liver enzymes and serum proteins in 3- to 18-mo-old animals. (PharmC)   
8. It is for this reason that the present study investigates linguistic accuracy in such detail, so as to be able to make inferences about the translation’s overall success. (LingC)

The absence of authors from academic texts has been regarded as a way to promote objectivity and to exclude personal interests in a claim (Marco, 2000), reflecting the “disinterestedness” of science (Merton, 1973). The word WE is supposed to be self-serving and divert attention from the informative content to the researchers. Biber et al. (2004) also found that first person pronouns are absent from stance bundles in the written academic register but are common in bundles in the classroom teaching and conversation registers. However, the attitude/modality bundles in the current study suggest that this dispreference for the self-mentioning pronoun in academic writing might be discipline-specific. Writers in the pharmaceutical sciences perhaps do not avoid using bundles with the first person pronoun WE to the same extent as writers in the field of applied linguistics do. In fact, authorial references in academic writing have been reported to be associated with multiple factors including discipline (McGrath, 2016), language and culture (Giannoni, 2008; Molino, 2010).

Fig. 3(a) shows that stance expressions in LingC and PharmC present some level of variability. But as shown in Table 3, the formulaic frames of the variable bundles are realized by a very limited set of function and content words (e.g., the, be, can, that). This may be because multiple bundles with the same specific function often overlap with each other. For instance, validity bundles like to the fact that and by the fact that only differ by one word, making it impossible for TO and BY to simultaneously account for over $5 0 \%$ of occurrences of the fact that. In fact, neither of the two words accounts for over $5 0 \%$ . But still, such stance bundles could also be regarded as highly fixed in both the corpora in the sense that they fulfill relatively fixed specific functions with relatively fixed formulaic frames. These findings are consistent with Sinclair’s argument that “the majority of text is made of the occurrence of common words in common patterns, or in slight variants of those common patterns” (1991, p.108). The current finding also shows that the interpretation of the bundle variability presented in Fig. 3 should take the form and function of each specific bundle into account.

# 4.2.2. Discourse organizers

Discourse organizers reflect the relationship between the prior and the coming discourse (Biber et al., 2004). In this study, the functions of discourse organizers are further classified as introducing a relatively new topic or elaborating on a specific topic (Table 4).

Topic introduction bundles. Except for the bundle with regard to the, all the remaining topic introduction bundles in both the corpora could be regarded as complete preposition phrases or noun phrases, and thus have a highly fixed structure. However, there are significant disciplinary variations in the use of topic introduction bundles. Despite the fact that both corpora employ the bundle on the other hand to introduce a contrasting fact/result, the normalized frequency in LingC is much higher than that in PharmC. As for the bundle in the present study, it often appears at the very beginning of a sentence or paragraph in PharmC to trigger a description of experimental operations/findings. But in LingC, this bundle is used mainly as a part of a modifier. It is hence classified as a referential bundle in LingC (as shown in Table 5). The following samples display this difference:

9. In the present study, we found that HP1g is part of a repressive complex including LSD1, HDAC1/2, COREST, and BRAF35. (PharmC) 10. ESP and language specialists in other contexts could draw on the methods used in the present study and similarly examine language-focused episodes in content lectures in other institutions and disciplines. (LingC)

Similarly, when placed at the beginning of a sentence, the bundle at the same time often heralds a statement on a relatively new and separate issue, but when appearing in other positions within a sentence, this bundle may be simply a referential expression of time. We here classify it as a discourse organizer not only because this function accounts for over half of the total occurrences in LingC, but also because the second function derives directly from its literal meaning (i.e., simultaneously), making it unnecessary to emphasize. The following samples reveal the different functions:

Notes: "Occur." represents the normalized occurrence per million words:. $^ { + + }$ marks the shared bundles by both the corpora; \* indicates the variable slot in the lexical bundle; --- shows that the bundle is highly fixed.

Topic elaboration bundles. Most of the discourse organizers are used for elaborating on a topic rather than introducing a new one. As can been seen in Table 4, these bundles generally clarify the nature of the relationships between a topic and associated details, such as additional (e.g., as well as the), conditional (e.g., in the context of, one the basis of, in light of the), inductive (e.g., these results indicate that, our data suggest that), focal (e.g., in terms of the), comparative (e.g., in contrast to the, is consistent with the, in line with the, in accordance with the), and action-related (e.g., were approved by, were added to, play a role).

The use of topic elaboration bundles shows both similarities and differences across disciplines. On the one hand, there are six topic elaboration bundles shared by LingC and PharmC. Moreover, the counterpart formulaic frames for each shared bundle are identical in both the corpora, indicating that the shared bundles show the same level of variability. On the other hand, the discipline-specific topic elaboration bundles (i.e., non-shared bundles) present obvious structural and semantic differences. Firstly, most non-shared bundles in LingC are preposition-phrase-based sequences (5 out of the 6), while most in PharmC are verb-phrase-based or clause-based sequences (20 out of 22). We have shown that the stance bundles in PharmC are almost all verb-phrase-based or clause-based sequences (see Table 3). This preference for verbs in the PharmC bundles also manifests itself in topic elaboration bundles. Secondly, PharmC contains a large number of lexical bundles that reflect the fixed moves of reporting empirical studies, such as describing experimental methods (e.g., were added to the, were obtained from), reporting findings (e.g., we found that the, play a role in), and interpreting results (e.g., is consistent with, these data indicate that), while LingC does not include bundles loaded with similar genre information.

\*The ratio of tokens between the two sub-corpora is 2.4, while that of raw frequencies of each bundle is higher.

# 4.2.3. Referential expressions

Referential bundles are used to identify an entity or to emphasize certain aspects of an entity as especially important. They are mainly preposition-phrased-based or noun-phrase-based word sequences that contain a head noun to specify the attribute of an entity (Table 5).

Identification/focus bundles. The identification bundles distinguish one entity out of many as especially worthy of being noted. Two such bundles are shared by the two corpora (i.e., one of the most, is one of the). Although LingC contains two extra identification bundles, they are quite similar to the shared ones in terms of their components. In all identification bundles, the pronouns ONE or EACH are used. The formulaic frames indicate that the word pair OF THE is the core component of these bundles. Generally, these bundles do not show vast disciplinary differences in variability.

Specification of attributes. The lexical bundles used for specifying certain characteristics of an entity show notable disciplinary variations.

The quantity bundles in PharmC are mainly about numbers, but those in LingC involve a larger variety of quantitative concepts, such as scope (e.g., a wide range of, as part of the), frequency (e.g., of the most frequent) and intensity (e.g., the extent to which, the degree to which). One interesting finding is the distinct levels of fixedness of the almost identical bundles the extent to which and the degree to which. The former is used as a highly fixed sequence, while the second slot in the latter is variable. With the much higher occurrence (77 per million words), the bundle the extent to which prevails over the degree to which in applied linguistics.

These quantity bundles also confirm that research paradigms impact the linguistic features of scientific writing (Gray, 2015; Candarli & Jones, 2019). We coded the 200 texts in LingC broadly as mixed or qualitative, according the methods used in the studies. A study was regarded as mixed if it is not purely qualitative, but involves some statistical, corpus or other quantitative methods in addition to qualitative interpretations. Thus LingC could be divided into two new sub-corpora. The sub-corpus of qualitative studies contains 58 texts and 525,995 tokens, while that of mixed studies consists of 142 texts and 1,277,675 tokens. Although the size ratio of the two sub-corpora is 2.4 (mixed to qualitative), the ratio of raw frequencies of each quantity bundle shows departure from this expected value (Table 6). One quantity specification bundle (i.e., of the most frequent) is absent from the sub-corpus of qualitative studies, but is quite frequent in mixed studies. The ratios of the other quantity bundles range from 2.9 to 13.7. Such disproportionate use of quantity bundles across the sub-corpora of a single discipline reflects the impact of the research paradigms.

When it comes to the tangible and intangible frames, a divide could also be observed between the two corpora. Here, attributes are defined as “tangible” in the sense that they can be measured with scientific instruments. First of all, the PharmC employs far more tangible frames than the LingC does. This result is consistent with the finding of Candarli and Jones (2019) that the research paradigms (i.e., quantitative versus qualitative) exert significant impacts on lexical bundles in research articles. Although both corpora in the current study consist of empirical studies, the research articles in LingC collect raw data from questionnaires, surveys, interviews, corpus analyses, and even qualitative observations, while pharmaceutical sciences obtain data mainly from controlled experiments. And controlled experiments are more likely to generate “tangible” results of higher diversity. Another difference is that most tangible frames in PharmC contain nominalized verbs or adjectives (e.g., reduction, concentration, composition, increase, absence, presence), while the head of tangible frames in LingC are all nouns (e.g., structure, form, content). This difference may explain the previous finding that quantity bundles are relatively rare in PharmC. By using these nominalized heads in tangible frames, writers of pharmaceutical sciences encoded the quantitative information in measurable and empirical terms rather than the direct numerical reference like NUMBER or EXTENT.

Despite the considerably larger number of intangible frames in LingC in contrast with PharmC, there is a high rate of repetition of the head nouns. For instance, the words USE, PURPOSE, and RESULTS occur in 8, 3, and 2 bundles in LingC. In 4.2.2, we pointed out that PharmC adopts many topic elaboration bundles closely related to the typical reporting move in empirical studies (e.g., these results indicate that, was added to the). Here, we find that many lexical bundles in LingC may convey similar meaning but with noun-phrase-based constituents rather than clause fragments or verb-phrase fragments.

Study/time/text reference bundles. Two bundles that function as a time reference and study reference are shared by the corpora. As illustrated by the concordance lines in 4.2.2, the bundle in the present study is used as a referential expression only in LingC, while in PharmC, it is mainly used to introduce a topic. The time reference bundle at the time of is used to specify a certain stage in a research program, as in:

13. They had their diaries with them at the time of the interview and four of them brought a mindmap to the interviews which condensed their entries. (LingC)   
14. Thus, in patients treated with sequential ALK inhibitors, repeat biopsies at the time of resistance are critical to identify refractory versus resensitizing compound mutations and to select the most effective therapeutic strategies. (PharmC)

Text reference bundles (e.g., performed as described previously) are used by PharmC to help readers retrieve information. While reducing redundancy, such bundles also reveal the discursive nature of the pharmaceutical texts.

Fig. 3 shows that, in LingC, referential expressions as a whole show a high level of variability, which may be partly explained by the productive formulaic frames listed in Table 7. All the formulaic frames that cover more than one variable bundle are included. A comparison of Tables 5 and 7 reveals that the most productive frames in LingC (e.g., \* the $^ *$ of, the \* of \*, $^ *$ the $^ *$ study) overlap largely with the referential bundles, while the most productive frames in PharmC not only cover fewer lexical bundles but also correspond to types of functions other than referential expressions (e.g., these $^ { * * }$ that, it is $^ *$ that, cells were \* in). It should also be noted that most of the productive formulaic frames contain two variable slots in LingC, but only one in PharmC. This may account for the finding shown in 4.1 (Fig. 2) that bundles from LingC on the whole are relatively less fixed than those from PharmC.

# 4.2.4. Other bundles

Some lexical bundles extracted from the two corpora are discipline-dependent. As shown in Table 8, these bundles occur because they point to the most regular research subjects or procedures that characterize an academic discipline. In general, such bundles show a relatively low level of variability and are limited in quantity.

# 5. Conclusions

This study examined the variability of lexical bundles extracted from two disciplinary corpora. Previous studies conducted by Biber (2009) and Gray and Biber (2013) both investigated the relationship between formulaic patterns and grammatical structures (e.g., verb-based, content-word-based, function-word based). The current study indicates that the analysis of formulaic patterns could also take academic disciplines and discourse functions into account. Lexical bundles from LingC generally show a higher level of variability than those from PharmC. The referential expressions in LingC and the discourse organizers in PharmC are less fixed than the other bundles within each corpus. Bundles in applied linguistics articles rarely contain verbs apart from when expressing epistemic stances, while those in the pharmaceutical sciences adopt a large number of clause-based or verb-phrase-based structures to evaluate the validity of the coming message or elaborate on prior topics. This preference for verbs in pharmaceutical science bundles is also reflected by the large number of tangible frames containing nominalized verbs or adjectives.

Findings of the current study shed light on the question of whether lexical bundles are “prefabricated” constituents. The lexical bundles that are variable in zero slots in our study, despite their relatively small number, show that some four-word sequences are frequently co-selected as integral units. In the cases where bundles are variable in one or two slots, the counterpart formulaic frames are found to exert significant influence on the selection of candidate fillers. For instance, compared with the vast number of grammatically and semantically appropriate candidate words, the actual fillers adopted by the lexical bundles under even the most productive frames (e.g., \* the $^ *$ of, these $^ { \ast \ast }$ that) show high a level of homogeneity. If “prefabricated” means, as Biber and Barbieri (2007) interpret, “being relatively fixed in form and not compositional in meaning”, our results support the view that most lexical bundles used in applied linguistics and pharmaceutical science research articles could be regarded as prefabricated chunks.

The two lists of lexical bundles and their counterpart formulaic frames could be used as valuable instruction materials for graduate-level academic writing classes. Novice writers should be capable of using the common lexical bundles of a particular discourse community (Wray, 2005), but it has been found that incidental acquisition of language formulas is likely to be ineffective (Boers & Lindstromberg, 2012). Therefore, overt teaching of lexical bundles is necessary for the apprentice writers to grasp these linguistic constructs. The findings of the current study may assist instructors in deciding which bundles should be prioritized when introducing them to the learners. For instance, some of the identified bundles overlap in the two corpora (e.g., it is possible that, in the context of), indicating that they could be especially useful for constructing academic discourse, regardless of disciplinary differences. There are also bundles found to be relatively fixed in all slots (e.g., studies have shown that, play a role in), reflecting the fact that they are frequently used as prefabricated non-compositional units by professional writers. Such shared or relatively fixed bundles deserve special pedagogical attention in teaching disciplinary writing. In addition, the formulaic frames extracted from the relatively less fixed bundles offer an extra perspective to understand lexical bundles in addition to functional analysis. These discontinuous multi-word sequences occur more frequently than their counterpart lexical bundles but are less salient to readers. Introducing these frames to learners may facilitate the reading and writing of disciplinary texts.

All the specific findings of the current study should be taken with caution. Firstly, although the lexical bundles and formulaic frames identified from the two corpora confirm a phraseological tendency, they should not be regarded as the only appropriate expressions for conveying certain discourse meanings. Some variants of the identified bundle or even entirely distinct expressions may have performed the same functions but remained undetected due to their relatively low frequency (less than 20 times per million words) or limited distribution (less than 5 texts). Secondly, the current study took variability as a categorical variable and set $5 0 \%$ as the cut-off for distinguishing a fixed slot from a variable one. This threshold, as Biber (2009) acknowledges, is an arbitrary one that was chosen to make the comparison of variability manageable. So even if a lexical bundle is found relatively fixed in every slot, this does not mean the elements are always co-selected in actual language use. Further “bundle-to-frame” studies can be conducted to explore how different cut-offs for a fixed and variable slot may influence the variability analysis results. Thirdly, the disproportionate use of quantity bundles in qualitative and mixed studies in applied linguistics confirms the impact of research paradigms on bundle use. The discussion of this topic is far from sufficient in the current study. The complexity of such impacts warrants an independent study focusing solely on research paradigms. Variability analysis may also be combined with genre analysis in future studies. For example, it could be used to identify and compare the formulaic frames used in the obligatory moves in the CARS model (Swales, 2004).
