Retrospective eye movement miscue analysis

This case study explored adult Chinese-Mandarin-speaking English learners' reading for academic purposes. Drawing on transactional socio-psycholinguistic perspectives, the researchers analyzed English learners' reading processes through retrospective eye movement miscue analysis. Six international graduate students studying social science and engineering read selected academic texts in their disciplines, retold the texts, watched their eye movement videos, and discussed their miscues and eye movements. In addition, the researchers interviewed participants about their reading perspectives and strategy uses in their respective disciplinary areas. The findings showed that all participants read for meaning and learning new knowledge. Participants' previous instruction and current disciplines both impacted their academic reading. They used general reading strategies and specific disciplinary strategies to read in their areas. The findings suggest that participants used all cueing systems and perceived academic reading as learning the content more than the language. Social science participants valued strategies and constantly reflected to improve their learning content knowledge. In contrast, engineering participants better identified their miscues and tended to correct for accuracy. Overall, the retrospective conversations helped them develop metacognition, understand their reading processes, and discover their strategies. This study offers educational implications for supporting post-secondary English learners' reading for academic purposes.

International students, especially those who use English as an additional language, face many challenges beginning their under graduate and graduate programs in the United States. These adult English Learners (ELs) must acclturate tostudying and living on a US college campus. They ofen struggle with learning new content knowledge that requires intense reading in their fields (Su & Harrison, 2016) since discipline-pecific texs ifer from those they read for pleasure. In addition, even if students value academic reading as a means for success have some discipline-specific background knowledge, and are aware of some text features (Hijikata et al., 2013; Taghizadeh & Khalili, 2019, ELs encounter difficulties due to limited vocabulary and background knowledge, overwhelming text length, complex sentence structure, unfamiliar graphic text features, and they struggle with academic discourse and synthesizing information (De Chazal, 2014; Hartshorn et al., 2017; Shen, 2013). Thus, their reading for academic purposes requires additional discipline-specific strategies (McKenna & Robinson, 2014). Although some ELs exhibit proficient test-taking strategies (Wang, 2020), these do not help with intense academic reading.

Chinese intenational students ften encounter various language, cultural, social, and learning chllenge for academic purposes as they adjust to the new environment (Ma & Wang, 2014). Thesestudents experience difficulties i critical reading, synthesis and article critique, which are necessary skill in higher education, and their test-taking experiences in China impact how they perceive accuracy in English learning (Liu, 2015). Some Chinese international students in a British college were found to experience frustration in their academic reading since they focused more on reading to learn language, which involve increased time and effort remembering words and decoding grammar and long sentences (Kuzborska, 2015). However, only a few research studies g., Chou, 2013; Jin et a., 2020; Shen, 2013) have explored reading for academic purposes from the students' perspective, to support their academic success Also, studies providing eye movement evidence are scarce. To address this gap and further understand international college learners reading process to support their education, we conducted this case study. The purpose of this study is to explore the adult ELs pro cesses of reading digital texts for academic purposes in their disciplines using miscue analysis and eye-tracking technology. The findings of this study provide implications for teaching disciplinary reading to secondary and college students.

# 1. Theoretical framework

Reading is transactional socio-psycholinguistic process. Readers use all language cueing systems to construct meaning from print (Goodman et al., 2016; Weaver, 2002). These include lingustic systems of graphophonics, syntax, and semantics, and the pragmatic systems of context, prior knowledge, and culture (Watson et a., 1988). Readers construct meaning from the text through initiating reading, sampling, and selecting from the text; making predictions and inferences; confirming or disconfirming predictions, integrating meaning; and terminating their reading (Goodman et al., 2005; Moore & Gilles, 2005). In addition, reading is a continuous transaction between the reader, text, and context tocreate understanding (Rosenblatt, 1978/1994). Readers stances or purpose for reading guide their understanding. The comprehending process is dynamic. Readers mentally create text as they encounter the author's text; their perceptions of the author'stext are more salient than the tex itelf, what readers think they seeis more critical than what they see in the text (Goodman et al., 2016).

Reading in a second language (L2) involves more complex processes than reading in th firt language (Koda, 2007).L1 reading, L2 proficiency, L2 decoding, prior literacy experience, and metalinguisic awarenessinfluence L2 reading (Koda, 2007; Koda & Zeher, 2008). Academic reading is "complex and discipline-specific" (Shen, 2013, p.71), and learners have to activate their 1 and L2 language systems and integrate their background knowledge for meaning and high-level thinking (Song et al., 2020). As Isason and Isakson (2016) point out, successful academic reading requires reading strategies, L2 reading proficiency, motivation, and meta cognitive awareness; and college students should be equipped with academic reading strategies and metacognitive awareness.

When secondary and collge students read in different disciplines, they used strategies that experts in their respective disciplines need to construct meaning (Buehl, 2017; McKenna & Robinson, 2014). Disciplinary texts ofen present information diferently; therefore, experts from different fields approach text differently (Shanahan, 2017). For example, Shanahan pointed ut that historians focus on primary sources and repond criticall, reding everything, while chemists frequently confirm graphic featres using text and evaluate trustworthiness. Thus, disciplinary literacy underscores the uniqueness of each discipline (Shanahan, 2013.

# 2. The research tool

Reading miscue analysis is an asesment tool for teachers to observe and researchers to investigate the reading proces (Goodman et al., 2005). Miscues occur when the readers oral responses are different from the printed text and readers' miscues and compre hension are analyzed using language cueing systems, which include the graphophonic system, the syntactic system, and the semantic system (Goodman et al. 2005). Building on miscue analysis, Retrospective Miscue Analysis (RMA), as an instructional and asesment tool, engages readers to revalue their reading behaviors by conferring with their tachers and peers about their miscues (Goodman et al., 2014; Goodman & Marek, 1996; Moore & Gilles, 2005). These retrospective conversations highlight the readers strengths and accomplishments and elicit suggestions for improvement.

Eye Movement Miscue Analysis (EMMA) combines miscue analysis with eye movement data and extends our knowledge from each methodology individually. In addition, EMMA adds another layer to miscue analysis by revealing readers' perceptual, visual, and sociocognitive reading strategies (Paulson, 2000, 2002). EMMA researchers examine how readers' fixation patterns and gaze points relate to their miscues and sociocognitive reading strategies. Gaze points are the one example of eye movement data recorded by the eye tracker with its -y coordinates and timestamps (Tobi Pro, 2019); fixations are gaze points where the eyes pause for a certain amount of time to gather information (Paulson, 2019; Rodrigues & Rosa, 2016). By analyzing eye movements alongside miscues, EMMA researchers uncover further supporting evidence of readers' underlying perceptual meaning-making process. This combined research approach offers a unique insight into reading processes that are not captured by other methodologies and assts in further determining what strategies students are using as part of the meaning-making process.

Retrospective Eye Movement Miscue Analysis (REMMA), which provides crucial insights into participants' perceived reading behaviors, is aretrospective reading conference about the readers' miscues and eye movements (Paulson & Freeman, 2003). Readers watch their eye movements and miscues and discuss their patterns and reading behaviors with the researchers.

# 3. Literature review

# 3.1. Adult ELs' reading for academic purposes

ELs reading comprehension is afected by many factors such as text genre, readers' background knowledge, their L1 and L2 reading competence, their knowledge about the academic discourse of the disciplines, their depth and breadth of vocabulary knowledge, their motivation and interest, and the development of their core academic language skill (Fitriana, 2018; Gu, 2017; Irahim et al, 2016; Nergis, 2013; Song et al., 2020). Readers appear to need particular reading abilies and strategies to comprehend text (e.g., infer encing, summarizing, and synthesizing iformation) (Grabe & Stollr, 2019 Stoller & Nguyen, 2020). Several studies have highlighted college Chinese-speaking ELs' academic reading strategies and comprehension (e.g, Chou, 2013; Jin et al., 2020; Shen, 2013), and some Chinese readers have been found to use specific cognitive and metacognitive strategies to comprehend academic texts, especially when the texs contain unfamiliar ocabulary (Chou, 2013; Jin et al., 2020). Common reading strategies reported in Chou's (2013) and Shen's (2013) studies include rereading, checking dictionaries, note-taking, and translating into the1. In addition, the participants in Shen's (2013) study previewed tites and keywords, guessed the word meaning, relied on teacher facilitation, sought help from peers, and referred to graphs, tables, or illustrations.

Scholars have examined college L2 learners' metacognitive awareness and have found that metacognitive reading strategies are positively related to their reading achievements (e.g., Magogwe, 2013; Zhang & Seepho, 2013). However, Zhang and Seepho (2013) found in their study that Chinese students majoring in English language with diffrent reading proficiencies might have various metacognitive awareness evels, and claimed that \*high proficiency students use more monitoring strategies than low proficiency students' (p. 62). Collectively, these studies have outlined the critical role of readers' metacognitie awareness in comprehending academic texts.

Readers tend to select different comprehension strategies when reading different text genres (Song et al., 2020). For example. Saadatnia et al. (2017) compared collge ELs' literal and inferential reading comprehension of expository and narrative texts and found literal comprehension was more critical when reading expository texts. Additionally, the participants from different disciplines had different reading beliefs and used different reading strategies when reading academic text. In an investgation of undergraduate English and engineering major students academic reading strategies, Shen (2013) found that the English major participants reported greater strategy use than the engineering participants. More specificall, the English students checked a dictionary immediately when they encountered unknown words, and summarized details when reading longer sentences. On the other hand, the engineering stu. dents preferred to seek external help from teachers and peers as well as using tables and figure in the texts to aid comprehension.

# 4. Eye tracking and miscue analysis studies with ELs

Paulson (200, 2002, 2008) was the first to use EMMA to examine the reading process. He found that when monolingual college undergraduate students read fictional narrative text, miscues were not caused by careless reading or skipping words. Instead, the readers only fixated on approximately two-thirds of the text, and were likely to fixate on an omission as well as on a substitution. His findings suggested that the eyes deliver information to the brain, and the brain transacts the information it receives; thus, reading is a perceptual process Most of the later EMMA studies have explored children's picture book reading and suggest that reading is a nonlinear process and not centered on accurate word decoding. The readers in these studies used multimodal signs, such as print text and pictures, for comprehension (Kim & Meyer, 2017; Liwanag, Pelatti, Martens, & Martens, 2016, 2017, 2020).

EMMA studies with bilingual Spanish and English users (Ebe, 2008; Freeman, 2001; Nelson et al., 2008) suggest that reading is a universal transactional socio-psycholinguistic proces, and that readers use similar strategies in both languages, although bilingual readers fixate more frequently and for a longer duration than monolingual readers (Duckett, 208). ELs integrate all Ianguage cueing systems more efectively in their L1 and reread more frquently in their L2 (Ebe, 2008). Hung et al.'s (2020) study with sixth-grade English as foreign language (EFL) students reading science texts showed that they focused more on the print texts than the visuals.

Hung (2019) and Hung et al. (2020) examined elementary school L1 users of Chinese reading intraditional Chinese. They found that Chinese readers paid lessattention to headings and punctuation i fictional and science texts, and paid moreattention to the print than the illustratios, although participants who fixated more on the illustrations understood the text better. In another study using miscue analysis, Croce (2015) found that multilingual students decoded disciplinary words in scintific informational texts, atempted to keep surface accuracy, and used the same terms and words from the text when they retold the texts.

These EMMA studies have revealed readers' miscues and eye fixations during reading and shown that reading is a nonlinear transactional socio-psycholinguisic proces. Building on these EMMA studies, previous REMMA studies (Paulson & Freeman, 2003; Porter et al., 2020; Wang & Arslan-Ari, 2021a, 2021b) further involved adult ELs and monolingual participants in retrospective discussions about their reading miscues, eye movements, and reading processes. As a result of the iscussions, participants became confident in their reading, understood that eye movement was not a linear proces, and revalued thir reading processes and themselves as readers. REMMA became not only a research tool but also an intructional tool that combined miscue analysis, eye tracking, and retrospective conversation to understand the reading process.

However, the studies mentioned above only investigated college students or adult ELs, reading for academic purposes in general. Little work has used EMMA or REMMA to explore how post-secondary Chinese-speaking ELs read disciplinary texts in their respective fields, or to compare their reading in social science and science areas. More studies are needed in order to better understand the discipline-spfic aadmic reding proces of adult Ls, ln their reding belief, explore the diciline-specific tategies they use, and support their academic success. Therefore, in this study, we amed to explore adult ELs' processes of reading digital texts for academic purposes in their isciplines using miscue analysis and eye-tracking technology. We intended to shed light on adult ELS disciplinary literacy skill and provide implications for adult and adolescent learners, instructors in intensive English programs secondary teachers, and disciplinary instructors. Our research question is: How do Chinese-Mandarin speaking ELs read disciplinary texts in social science and engineering fields?

# 5. Methodology

This study employed a mixed-method case study design (Merriam, 2009; Stake, 1995; Yin, 2017) in which both quantitative and qualitative data were concurrently collected to provide more in-depth evidence of the processes involved in adult ELs' reading of digital texts for acadmic purpose. In addition, quantitative and qualitative dat were analyed separately and mergedto validate the findings. This study is a part of a comprehensive project conducted at a large southeastern university in the United States.

# 5.1. Participants and context

At the time of this study, approximately 2,o00 international students were enrolled at this institution: about $5 . 7 \%$ of the student body (International Student Services, 2019). We chose to work with Mandarin-speaking graduate students, as they comprise the largest population of international students at this institution. In addition, our research team members speak Chinese; thus, they could communicate, translate (when needed) and interpret the data in two languages. The criteria to select participants were that they should: 1) speak Chinese Mandarin as their first language, (2) have grown up and received K-12 education in Mainland China, (3) be learning English as a foreign language since their upper elementary school, (4) be living in the United States within two years of earning their graduate degrees, (5) be enrolled as first-year or second-year graduate students, and (6) read intensively in their disciplines. The recruitment information was distributed through the university's Chinese student email listserv. Based on these criteria the researchers recruited six volunteers. Table 1 presents the demographics of the participants.

# 5.2. Text selection

We selected two stand-alone sections from two books which were descriptive expository texts for academic purposes, relevant to participants' disciplines, at college difficulty level, and 800to 1,000 words long with one embedded image. Text 1 Narrative and Argument Advertising (Zheng et al., 2019) was for social science students, and Text 2 Importance of Robotics and Mechatronics in Society (Yamamoto, 2016) was for engineering students. Therefore, the participants were expected to have some prior knowledge of the topics even though they had never read these texts. Acording to the Lexile Analyzer, the two texts were 1210L-1400L, about college-level (Lexile, n.d.). Both texts contained similar fatures to the infomational texts the participans red in their fields (i. edings, in-text citations, embedded images, discipline-specific terms and concepts, and complex sentence tructures). In addition, both texts included two to four major headings and a flowchart that provided a visual summary which was equivalent to the information presented in the text, showing the relationships between the activities. Texts were presented on PowerPoint slides using Arial 11-point font with 1.5-line spacing, a 1-inch margin on both sides and a 0.5-inch margin at the top and bottom. Text 2 was slightly modified to keep text features similar to those in Text 1, for consistency. We edited both text layouts to appear on four pages with the image at the top of the last page. During reading, texts were displayed in full-screen slideshow mode.

# 5.3. Equipment

The Tobii x3-120 portable screen-based eye tracker (Tobii Pro, 2019) was used to capture the reader's eye movements in a Human Computer Interaction Lab. We chose this model to increase authenticit in the data collction sessions. Tobii X3-120 portable eye tracker uses minimal hardware and provides a close-to-reallifereading experience. It llows for flexility of head movement between 50 and $9 0 \mathrm { c m }$ from the center of the eye tracking device, and the reader does not have to wear headgear, position the chin on a chin rest or restrict head movement with a bite bar, which might cause discomfort. The device was atached to a 21-inch computer monitor with $1 , 0 2 8 \times 7 6 8$ pixel resolution where the reading material was displayed. Tobii Pro Studio was used to record participants' eye movements and analyze the relevant data.

# 5.4. Procedure and data collection

In the larger project, participants attended two reading sessions and pre-and post-interviews. We focused on the pre-interview and participants' reading in their respective disciplines in this case study. First, we conducted the pre-interview - the modified Burke Reading Interview for adult learners (Goodman et al., 2005) to learn about participants'reading views and strategy uses in their disciplinary areas. Next, we invited the participants to browse the pages quickly (approximately 15 s so they could report if they had read it before and rate their prior knowledge about the topic. Then, we prepared the participants to read the text on the computer monitor (i.e., adjusting the seating and distance to the computer monitor, becoming familiar with using the mouse to click for page changes and calibrating for eye movement recording). Next, the social science area students read the social science text aloud, and the engineering students read the engineering text aloud. We allowed participants to read the first page silently because reading behavior is complicated when readers start reading immediately, and they tend to make more miscues (Goodman et al., 2005). Then, participants read aloud the remaining three pages. They were alowed to reread or use any strategie as if they were reading independently. We did not give any directions for reading the graphs aloud, and the participants all chose o read them silently. After reading aloud, they retold what they remembered and answered a few comprehension questions. The eye tracker recorded the reading. Yang marked the readers' miscues on hard copies and took notes during the read-aloud. Ismahan monitored the eye tracker and recording and took notes in preparation for the discussion.

After retellig, we played the eye movement video recordings on the computer monitor and talked with the participants about their miscues and eye movements, borrowing questions from the RMA procedure (Moore & Gilles, 2005) and the REMMA interview (Paulson & Freeman, 2003)(see the sample questions in Appendix). Final, we conferred with the participants to help them analyze their behavior and reflect. The average length of each session was 1 h. Reading aloud took $1 0 { - } 1 5 \operatorname* { m i n }$ , retelling took approximately 10 min, and conferring took about $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ Although English was used in the sessions, participants used Chinese Mandarin whenever they had difficulty expressing themselves or felt more comfortable doing so. All retrospective conversations were recorded.

# 5.5. Data analysis

We analyzed participants oral readings, retellings, and retrospective dialogues through a multicycle coding proces. We used the Reading Miscue Iventory (Goodman et al., 2005) to analyze readers miscues and retellings. Each variation from the text or miscue was coded for syntactic acceptability, semantic acceptabilit, meaning change, correction, graphic and sound similarit. Phonological dialects were not coded, in accordance with the in-depth procedure described by Goodman et al. The retelling was evaluated from three aspects: recalling of specific information $( 5 0 \% )$ generalizations $( 2 5 \% )$ , and understanding of major concepts $( 2 5 \% )$ (Goodman et al., 2005). Next, we read the retrospective conversations and coded the themes emerging from the data (Stake, 1995). Areas of Interest (AOIs) in Tobii Pro Studio software were determined for each text paragraph and figure areas to analyze the eye movement data. Then, integrative transitions, the number of eye movements between text and image AOIs, were calculated by summing the number of times the eye fiation moved from the text to the mage and from the mageto the text AIs. Fixation was defined as the time when the eye pauses and remains stationary at a certain spot for at least $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ (Cook & Wei, 2017). Moreover, gaze plots, visuals showing the order and duration of the fixations on the screen, were generated to understand th citical aspects of the participants eye movements during reading.

To ensure inter-rater reliabilit, at least two research team members independently listened to the reading recordings to mark and code each participant's miscues. They compared their marking and miscue coding, then discussed any ifference to reach aconsensus. In addition, a second member checked the transcriptions for accuracy. Finall, two members coded the transcribed interviews and retrospective conversations separately and compared their coding for collaborative decisions. All members read the data multiple times and thoroughly participated in the data analysis phase. Regarding the eye movement data, team members ooked together at all the eye movement data which represented each theme, discussed them, and came to a consensus on the selection of the eye movements.

# 6. Findings

As we deeply explored the qualitative data, four themes emerged. First, participants previous instruction and current disciplines influenced their academic reading. Second, all participants read for meaning and learning new content. Third, participants used natural reding stratgies and allanguage systems. Fourth, participants reported general discilinary strategies and specfic trategies used in their fields.

# 6.1. Influence of previous instruction and current disciplines

The participants reported that their former instruction was practice-heavy, exam-driven, and even with a deficit view of their English language skill. For example, they mentioned that in high school and college they had learned English by taking language classes, and from their teachers,textbooks, and worksheets, memorizing words and conversational dialogues and learning grammar rules. In addition, the high-stakes exams and tests were the only evaluations of their language proficiency. Therefore, they were not confident with their proficiency and barely valued their strengths. Jingmiao said, When I take class I know that I'm not good at grammar. They also reported watching television and digital media,listening to English songs, and talking to L1 users of English to learn and practice conversational English. Their previous educational experiences did not prepare them to read intensively and extensively in their disciplinary areas.

While attending graduate school in the United States, all participants reported facing challenges in intense reading in their respective disciplines, as these reading materials were discipline specific. For example, Shuyao, studying communications, reported reading newspapers and social media besides research articles. Due to their interdisciplinary research projects, the enginering participants all reported reading texts with graphs and figures and acrosdifferent disciplines fr collaborative proects. In addition, Shuyao identified the importance of disciplinary knowledge, I don't have the background knowledge of that [content. And there's a lot f terminologies. That will be the most difficult part. They all reported that disciplinary vocabulary and knowledge played critical roles in their reading.

Participants reported that they worked hard independently and sought help from their mentors beyond coursework. For example, Yutong said,  learned] some books about how to read and especiall late for my graduate. Especiall I'm interested in the books that for academic reading for graduat tudents. Allparticipants reorted that they liked leaning from their advisers or profeors who are experts in their fields. In addition, participants preferred to lean from mentors sharing similar cultural and linguistical backgrounds because they believed these mentors ofered more eficient trategies nd tips to which they could relate. For example, Shuyao shared, "He [adviser] told me, Don't read word by word. I think the biggest help, the most help that I got is from the Chinese professor because she understands how I fel." The participants mentioned that they had a closer relationship and received more advice from Chinese and Korean-speaking professors in their fields than from English monolingual professors.

# 6.2. Reading for meaning and learning

Participants responses from the interview and REMMA sessions demonstrate that they read for information and comprehension. As Yutong said, \*[When he reads he] can get information he needs and get the structure [main points]. Understand the [meaning] behind, the logic of the statement." Guang commented, Try to understand more. I think it's just try[ing] to learn more information. Shuyao used a metaphor to show her view of reading, \*reading is just like picking aples in the garden. You dont need to know every shape of the leaves f tree right? ou just need to get the general idea." Overall the prticiants rorted that i was fine to leave the miscues uncorrected if they understood the meaning.

In addition to being meaning-driven, some participants were task-driven when they attempted to memorize terms for their retelling. For example, Mengmeng said, I know it's the end of the reading, so you guys are going toask me to recll th reading. I'm trying torecall. lthough they read for academic purposes, the participants allshared a road view that reading helps open my eyes and know a lot of things" (Mengmeng). Allprticipants aimed to read more eficiently, use more effective strategies, and understand better, asthey knew \*time is limited, the materias ae too much. Therefore, they tried to increase their reading speed and toskim and scan.

The social science students emphasized forming their own opinions besides discerning the authors opinions and the importance of disciplinary knowledge. Yutong said, \*Know the idea and how the author presented; persuade me or reject his opinion; [think about] how would Istructure this opinion." Shuyao shared her view that Reading i take[ing] other ideas or opinions they [the authors] just know and put(ting] them into your framework of knowledge. Actually, I'm like a sponge. Just absorbing the water from other new materials here." On the other hand, the engineering participants viewed reading as an essential tol for learning new content and researching. Liu expressed the view that \*Reading firstly help[s] us to acquire the instant news [and] instant message. Then secondly, just for do[ing] the research." Jingmiao echoed, t can help me keep up with the proces of my research fied. They also mentioned the importance of vocabulary and grammar. They wanted to memorize more words and authentic expressions, improve their grammar, and build reading stamina. One reader Liu, was more accuracy-driven and said \*If I found I made a mistake, I want to correct it."

# 6.3. Use of natural reading strategies and all language systems

Participants reported in the interview that they used online search strategies and 1 assistance. They also read relevant materials in Chinese and translated English words using atranslation app, online translation tool, and bilingual dictionary. Participants with higher retelling scores previewd the text (g., Shyao, utong, Liu, and Guang), paused during reading to proces, and rerd to understand. They also asked questions about the author and the text and sometimes critiqued the text. Guang said, \*What does the feature talk about? The author didn't give us an example.' 'I'm always wondering why the article didn't tell us the categories of mechatronics." One social science participant critiqued the text for incompleteness Her comment was accurate because the text was shortened due to the limitation of text selection. All participants used general reading strategies, including drawing on graphophonic information and the syntactical system, using the context and prior knowledge, and examining the text structure and graphs. ll these strategies are explained in detail below.

# 6.3.1. The graphophonic system

Participants relied on graphophonics, as indicated in the high percentages $( 8 6 . 9 5  – 1 0 0 \% )$ of graphic and sound similarity in Table 2. When they encountered unknown disciplinary words, they relied on their graphophonic knowledge to pronounce them. They used their lexical knowledge such as prefixes and suffixes to predict word meanings. They did not use other words to replace those disciplinary words but decoded them. When participants knew the disciplinary words, they worried les about the pronunciation (e., mechanics, mecharonics so they could read efficiently. Their eyes fixated on the disciplinary vocabulary (e.g, terms, keywords) that they miscued and sometimes regresed to the previous texts. They did not omit any disciplinary vocabulary or insert any words before or after these words. They mostly knew or predicted the meaning of the words and struggled with the pronunciation although they used graphophonic systems. For example, social science participants struggled to pronounce exhortation as/ egz-hor'tern/and ante cedents as/ tarn-sidents/. Engineering students strained to pronounce mechatronics as/ metretranks/and actuators as/:kju;,eites. When participants did not understand the text, they substituted the disciplinary words with other words. For example, social science participants read \*immersion for imagery, andevolution for evocation, nginering participants read "electronics" for economics, and technological' for technical. Those miscues changed the meaning of the text and affected their comprehension during the retelling. When Mengmeng read \*"instructed' for ilustrated in Fig 1, she had two fixation points on the word (36-38). However, she did not monitor her reading or correct this low-quality miscue. She reported that these two words looked alike.

# 6.3.2. The syntactic system

Participants interview, miscue, and REMMA session data all emphasized their heavy use of the syntactic cueing system.All participants mentioned their intense grammar practices when they leaned English at high school and college. Their grammatical relations were strong, as shown in Table 2, and they highlighted their grammar usage when reading long complex sentences. For example, Jingmiao relaced the basis for with the basis of." ven though her eye fixated on the text, she did not correct it (Fig. 2). She explained it did not change the meaning. In addition to the graphophonics, she relied on syntax to predict.

This example also shows that she was shfing her view of reading. She gradually relinquished acuracy when discussing her miscue.

# 6.3.3. Context

The participants used the context to predict and understand. For example, when Jingmiao read the engineering text, she substituted Economics with \*Electronics," which shares some graphophonic similarity. The gaze plot (Fig. 3) shows her eye fixations on Economics. She explained, I think probably because this pasage is about something related to electronics." In addition to graphophonic and syntactic systems, she used the context to predict Electronics." She reported that watching the eye movement video and talking about her miscues helped her comprehend the text.

# 6.3.4. Prior knowledge

All partcipants used their prior knowledge, as reported in their BRI and REMMA. The engineering participants mentioned using more prior knowledge in their disciplines and cross-disciplines because of their interdisciplinary research. Liu mentioned that she often read relevant materials in L1 to build prior knowledge and relied on her L1 to understand in English. For example, she ofen learned a new word's meaning in Chinese and then understood it in the English text. Conversely, Jingmiao, whose retelling score was low, did not activate much prior knowledge. The social science participants mentioned that the examples in the text were helpful for under standing. Yutong, who had a high retelling score, related the text to her research and critiqued the text for presenting incomplete information. Shuyao, with an intermediate retelling score, asked if she needed to answer our questions as an expert in her field. This indicates that she knew the differences between academic reading and reporting for academic purposes.

# 6.3.5. Text structure and graph use

The participants reported in the interview that they looked for keywords and key sentences when they read. Their retelligs fol. lowed the text organization. The EMMA showed that they noticed text features such as subheadings, structure, the figure and its caption, and examples in the text. In particular, they studied the graph. The integrative transitions in Table 2 indicate that their eyes looked at both text and graph and transited between them. The readers who had high reteling scores had the highest number of integrative transitions, which means that they mainly referred to the graph for meaningful onnections between the graph and the text. The social science participants made more interative transitions i. the number of times the reders ye fixation moves between the text and image areas) compared to the engineering students. For example, Shuyao's eye movements indicated that she read the graph multiple times. The gaze plot in Fig. 4 represents Yutong's eye movements on the text and graph. She elaborated, I willook this [graph] because the direction of the arrow makes a huge difference for me. After she completed her oral reading, she reead the page silently. She commented, I'm not reading this [text] sentence by sentence . I eed to go back to remind myself the most important messages in this aticle." She attempted to "put this content in my mind that like a tree." She visualized the text for comprehension.

Fig. 2. Miscue substitution: "Of'.

Jingmiao: I don't think it changes the meaning because there is no meaning change, for or "of."   
Yang (First Autor): Do you need to change it?   
Jingmiao: Yeah, I think so.   
Yang: You still think you need to correct it.   
Jingmiao: Yeah.   
Yang: Even though it doesn't change the meaning.   
Jingmiao: Yeah.   
Yang: Why do you want to correct it?   
Jingmiao: Maybe because the grammar.   
Yang: But you kind of explaned it didn't change the meaning. If it didn't change the meaning, does t til soud like language? Follows the grammar rules?   
Jingmiao: I think so.   
Yang: Then do you still think you need to change it?   
Jingmiao: Probably not.

Fig. 4. Yutong's gaze plot.

The participants who demonstrated the lowest comprehension had the fewest integrative transitions. That is they relied least on the graph. For example, Jingmiao's retelling score was low, and she skipped the graph when she moved to the top of the page (see Fig. 5). The gaze plot shows that her Fixations 3 and 4 were on the graph. From Fixation 5 she moved to the text. She did not read the graph until the tet referred to it. She omitted one text box in the graph and only fixated on one word in two text boxes. Even though she revisited the graph at the end of her reading, she only looked at two text boxes. She explained, "I didn't understand these re. lationships in the text]. So, I think  cant understand this figure. Apparently, she regarded understanding the text as the conditionfor understanding the graph and did not perceive the graph as a visual aid to understanding the text.

Overall, participants used all the language systems and visual aids for meaning. Although we have presented each system separately here, the examples demonstrate that the participants relied on multiple systems simultaneously when reading the disciplinary

materials.

# 6.4. General and specific disciplinary strategies

Participants used more general reading strategies in REMMA sessions than they reported in their interviews. They only mentioned online searching and translating in their interviews. However, they used all their cueing systems, reread, skipped unnecessary information, predicted, monitored, and corrected. Regarding general content area reading strategies, they reported using keywords/ sentences and prior knowledge, and highlighted that essential information. They used more strategies for academic reading purposes: studying text features and organization, focusing on figures and examples,aking questions, making connections, and memorizing terms. Social science participants were aware of diferences in professional responses, valued strategy use, and reflected on their reading, while engineering participants identified miscues, worked across disciplines, and used L1 assistance.

# 6.4.1. Social science

6.4.1.1. Disciplinary response. The participants were aware that professional reading responses in their feld differed from general reading responses. As reported in their interviews, they used professional content-related dictionaries and their content knowledge. Although they did not often have frsthand experiences to build connections, they connected to their previous knowledge in the field. For example, Yutong connected new information to her previous content knowledge. In addition, they used a placeholder strategy when they came upon disciplinary words they could not pronounce or understand yet. For example, Yutong talked about \*TIM" in the tex, h eountr th firstor secon ime I just oe t, ut f it wl eet oming to my e. sot t I wll ke in mind that I would check it later."

6.4.1.2. Valuing strategies. Participants reported that "strategies are more important than words." First, they prepared for reading by previewing the text and looking up original sources. Next, they noticed the sources in the in-text citations when they read. They also read with purpose, asked questions, and sometimes drafted summaries. They wondered about the author's purpose and thought from both the author's and the reader's perspective. They reported and practiced making connections, discussing text structure, sharing opinions, and creating mental texts for understanding. Other strategies that they only mentioned, but did not practice in this study, were note-taking and reflecting on reading, as well as asking questions and discussing wit their professor. They lunderscored the professors guidance. Last, they created their own texts to understand. For example, they all made high-quality miscues on ad and advertising (see Table 3). However, they did not think their miscues changed the meaning of the text. Overall, ll their tategies contributed to their comprehension.

Table 3 Social science participants' miscues.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Social Science</td><td>Miscue</td><td>Text</td></tr><tr><td> Mengmeng</td><td>advertising</td><td>ad</td></tr><tr><td>Yutong</td><td>advertise</td><td>advertising</td></tr><tr><td> Shuyao</td><td>advertisement</td><td>advertising</td></tr></table></body></html>

6.4.1.3. Self-reflection. Participants reflected in the REMMA sessions to become more strategic and efficient readers. They were interested in learning their eye movement patterns, such as fixations and regressions. For example, Mengmeng asked, \*Why is this [fixation dot] becoming big?" Yutong learned, It [fixation dot] gets big because you spend more time on that area. The participants all noticed that their eyes did not move linearly. For instance, Shuyao identified that meaning-making was her goal aftr watching her eye movements, and was proud of herself for not reading word-for-word. Mengmeng noticed that she skipped many things i the text. All participants noticed that their eyes regressed and moved faster than sound. Shuyao commented, "Your voice cannot catch up with your eyes." She discovered that \*The figure is just very important" and learned to study it within the text. Furthermore, she said.

I really waste alo of time on the dificult pronunciation of word. And that makes me nervous and then forget about the main idea.. think the main idea is my lover, i the destination I should go to, but I just waste a lot of time on the pronunciation of the dificlt words and the names. I will not do that again in the future.

# 6.4.2. Engineering

6.4.2.1. Miscue identication. The engineering participants identified their miscues while watching their eye movement videos. Liu said, "If I found [that] I made a mistake, I want to correct it." However, most times, the participants valued meaning-making rather than accuracy. For example, Liu read "methods" instead of models in Fig. 6. After identifying this miscue, she explained that \*they are the same." This demonstrates her focus on meaning-making.

6.4.2.2. Disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge. The participants activated their prior knowledge of disciplinary and interdisci. plinary content. In their interviews, they reported using context and prior content knowledge to guess the meanings of unknown words. One participant even mentioned doing interdisciplinary projects In their reading, Guang read "actors" instead of actuators and explained, I just want to know how to pronounce the word. In the former sentence, I think the sentence is hard to understand. So, I stopped there for a while. think I didnt understand the meaning. He further elaborated that the reason he did not understand was he had not learned this concept yet, I tell you before I was in computer science before. I transfer to EE [electrical enginering] this semester. This concept i very popular in EE. I haven't learned anything about it. But I know the concept of it." When Guang explained one miscue, the conversation led to his conection to his field,  think it should be nees both. And in the former sentence, th folproof design, I stop here for a while because I know a word a fail-prof design. Fail-poof design is what I leaned in this semester." Guang constantly applied his disciplinary knowledge.

6.4.2.3. L1 asstance. Participants reported that they often learned new content words to prepare for reading disciplinary materials. They reported that, when they read, they overcame their language barrier (e.g., learning the content in L1, translating L2 into 1 to understand, and using L1 to explain the word meaning). For example, Liu could not remember the exact words used in the text when retellig, and struggled with pronunciation, saying, "f I know the words [traslations] of Chinese, maybe I [would] understand this." In addition, Guang used his L1 to explain the meaning of the word flow. He pronounced it like \*follow." With his L1 assistance, he efficiently communicated and helped the researchers to understand his dialect.

# 7. Discussion

Congruent with the previous literature (e.g., Goodman et al., 2005; Porter et al., 2020) that readers use all cueing systems to understand, the participants in ths study used both linguistic cueing systems and pragmatic systems of context and prior knowledge when they read in their disciplines. They perceived academic reading as learning the content more than the language (Kuzborska, 2015). Their metaphors of "sponge" and "tree' highlighted their reading perspectives and behaviors. Even though the participants believed meaning-making was essential and used multiple general and disiplinary strategies, they all decoded and tried to stay accurate when they encountered disciplinary words. Furthermore, they attempted to borrow the same terms and words from the text in their oral retellings. This finding echoes Croce's (2015) study with multilingual children reading scientific informational texts.In addition, while previous sudies showed readers meaning-making using both print text and visual rpresentations (e.g., Liwanag et al., 2017; Wang & Arslan-Ari, 2021a), this study found that regardles of discipline, participants who applied more strategies paid closer attention to the figure, and made more frequent connections between texs and graphs to understand the texts better, since the figure provides the visual summary of the text.

As Shanahan (2017) argued, our data provide evidence that readers' strategies difer across disciplines. Social science students were more aware of the text features when reading in their disciplines. They used general reading stratgies similar to those reorted in previous studies (., Jin et al, 2020; Shen, 2013). Moreover, participants in this study valued strategies toward meaning-making and constantly reflected to improve their reading and learning. This could be because they were graduate students and more self-motivated in the learning proces. In contrast the engineering participants beter identified their miscues and corrected them for accuracy. The reason could be that their discipline requires more quantitative accuracy in research and practice. Also, they were more involved in interdisciplinary projects. They reported more barriers in terms of language usage and tended to rely more on their L1.

Just as metacognitive conversations link social, personal, cognitive, and knowledge-building dimensions in disciplinary learning (Schoenbach et al., 2012), the retrospective conversations helped participants increase metacognition, understand their reading processe in their diciplines, and discover their strategies. This sugests that students need social metacognitive conversations in their

Fig. 6. Miscue substitution: "Methods".

Liu: The correct is models. I read it as "methods."   
Yang: Yeah. Why did you read?   
Liu: I think the mathematical should be, the next word of the mathmatical may be the \*methods." Because I read many papers for our areas. So, I just think [it should be methods].   
Yang: I see you are actually predicting that. Does it make sense here to say \*methods' instead of models?   
Liu: I think they are the same.

instruction to beter prepare them to become independent readers and for intense learning for academic purposes. Like other studies that have highlighted metacognitive strategies that influence ELs' reading (e.g., Isakson & Isakson, 2016; Zhang & Seepho, 2013), participants in this study realized that strategies were essential and learned to become increasinglystrategic readers in their disciplines. In addition, they all identified that efficiency is an important goal when they read and learn in their disciplines.

These adult leaners' previous lecture-heavy and practice-dril instruction and test-driven English learning experiences impacted their reading in this study and earlier studies (e.g., Wang & Arslan-Ari, 2021a; 2021b). Thus, despite being self-motivated and possessing the agency to learn, they invested tremendous efort and time to self-discover eficient disciplinary reading strategie. Addtionally, participants reported the importance of mentorship, preferring to learn from international professors who share similar Ianguages and cultures, as they believed that these mentors knew their learning needs better and could provide more helpful learning insights for international students. Therefore, reading for academic purposes in L2 becomes a socio-cultural-psycholingustic proces.

# 7.1. Implications and limitations

Our study provides implications for researchers and educators who work with adult learners in secondary schools and collges. REMMA and ther reading conferences are effctive practice for incresing metacognition and trategy use with adult ELs for reading in their disciplines. The conversation help readers increase metacognition, uncover their own efficient and effectie strategies, and help them develop disciplinary literacy skils. Teachers could teach general reading strategies and discipline-specific trategies since some strategie that work well in one area may not work in others. For instance, they might instruct social science students to reflect on their trategy use and engineering students to build cross-isciplinary connections. ELs can read in their L1sto build their schema. Secondary and college students could be encouraged to work alongside, and learn from, experts in their individual disciplines, especially those who share similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds.

This current study has several limitations, which are the general limitations of a case study. First, the sample size is small the participants were all Chinese and from limited areas of study, and only one participant was male. Further studies could consider including more participants from other disciplines, such as humanities, busines, medicine, and natural cience, and provide implications acros varied disciplines. I addition, participants reported that they usually marked up the texts with a pen or on a tablet, but reading on the computer monitor limited their use f these strategies. Last, the elected texts each contained only one embedded graph, future studies could consider selecting multi-image disciplinary texts.
