Written translanguaging within educational settings has drawn increasing attention in recent years, but research which explores translanguaging practice in detail in the postgraduate dissertation writing process is still limited. This study focuses on five Chinese postgraduate students who studied at a British university. It investigates their translanguaging practice in the outlining, note-taking and drafting phases of their master's dissertation writing process with reference to Plakans' reading-to-write test task model. We collected and analysed the texts from our participants and conducted interviews to introduce emic perspectives to our analysis. The findings reveal six translanguaging practices in the academic dissertation writing process, showing that translanguaging supports students' development of self-regulation and serves as an efficient self-regulation tool for them to control the recursive and extensive dissertation writing process, to reach their immediate and global writing goals. The paper problematizes and challenges the orthodox academic discourse and practice and highlights the need for EAP tutors and dissertation supervisors to encourage translanguaging in students' writing practice in response to the potential issues raised by the monolingual norms in the academic communities.

# 1. Introduction

Translanguaging has atracted increasing attention from scholar over the past decade due t it capacity to embrace and reflect the diversity of population, languages and cultures against the backdrop of globalisation. The discussion of translanguaging emerged initiall in relation to oral communication and soon expanded to writing. Most studies focusing on translanguaging in academic writing have been in primary and secondary education (Caruso, 2018), with few in higher education (e.g., Chen, 2017; Chen et al., 2019); of these, none to our knowledge have investigated the genre of postgraduate dissertation writing. The dissertation plays a significant role in the sucesful completion of a master's degre, and difers from traditional academic esays in length, leeway for topic choices, and because it includes specific sections on methodology results and discussions for example.

Additionally, supervisors and institutions often take more interest in the dissertation product, and littl attention is paid to the process, particularl regarding how bilingual students appropriate their linguistic and semiotic resources. Much of the research on translanguaging relating to master's dissertation composition processes focuses on the key interactions involved in the supervisory process and the broader writing context e.g, Adamson et al., 2019; Kaufhold, 2018). The lack of knowledge about translanguaging in the private issertation composition proces indicates that the implicit expectations that supervisors and institions might poses in relation to this procedure remain largely unquestioned. This could reinforce the relatively rigid view English for Academic Purposes (EAP) practitioners may hold towards the orthodox academic practices, which are deeply embedded in a Western monolingual orientation, often excluding the resources and practices of intenational students (Canagarajah, 2018), and potentially placing them at an academic disadvantage. Therefore, knowledge of how translanguaging plays arole in the dissertation writing proces can not only provide pdaggical benefits toEAP practitioners anddisertation supervisors, ut aso offr insight into the potentil fr reneotiating traditional academic discourse and practice in this writing proces. To address this current rearch gap, this paper analyses in detal the texts produced by a group of postgraduate Chinese students during their disertation writing process and interviews the writers to integrate their emic perspectives into the analysis,exploring translanguaging beyond the boundary of language courses in higher education.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Translanguaging

The concet of translanguaging is continually expanding and refers to the simultaneous use of different languages, language varieties (., Canagrajah, 206), rester (e, Kaold, 2018) as well as the dierse smiic systms and mdalities (., elasco & Garcia, 2014) in writing. Translanguaging views diffrent linguistic and semiotic resources as one integrated linguistic repertoire (Garcia, 2014) and is interested in how multilinguals use languages to make sense of the world (Brooks, 2022). With this analytical perspective, researchers are no longer restricted to \*doing structural analysis for identifying the frequent and regular linguistic patterns" but focus on \*how language users break boundaries betwen named languages and non-linguistic semiotic systems' in a particular moment (Tai & Wei, 2021, p. 5). Garcia and Klifgen (2019) point out that the translanguaging lens is a productive perspective in literacy research as it \*could result in learning more about the complex process by which multilinguals ssemble their meaning-making resources and form relations among a range f forms of semiosis to interpret and produce texts" (pp. 58-559), and allow for a greater understanding of how translanguaging affects international students' writing process.

# 2.2. Translanguaging as a self-regulation strategy in writing

This study is interested in translanguaging in the relatively private writing proces rather than the rhetorical and communication functions of the final writing product, which have been discussed extensively in previous research (e.g., Canagarajah, 2011a). Despite the scant attention that has een paid to the private writing proces, it is well-known that \*writing activities are usually self-planned, self-initiated, and self-sustained" (Zimmerman & Risemberg, 1997, p. 73). The highly private writig proces provides writers with a space to actively engage inner speech and develop various self-regulation strategies.

Self-regulation (learning) refers to students exercising their agency to monitor and control their condition, behaviour and motivation, which i systematically and cyclically oriented owards the atanent of their erning goals (Alexander et al., 2011; chunk & Zimmerman, 2003). A closely relevant concept is inner speech, aform of elf-directed speech which can operate as a selfregulation tool. It i often highly eliptical and packed with complex meanings which can be very personal and even idiosyncratic (Flower, 1979. Inner speech can facilitate and develop self-regulation (Verhaeghen & Mirabito, 2021) although self-regulation does not always require inner speech. Research on nner speech in writing considersthe written modalit directed to the writers themseles as the "externalized iner speech" (also known as private speech) in response to challnging cognitive tasks or "as a vehicle for selfcommunication' (de Guerrero, 2005).

On reviewing previous litrature, Harris et al. (2011 identify a range of elf-reulation strateies in the writing proces, including "goal setting and planning", \*record keing (e, making notes)", ganzing (e, ganzing notes or text), \*reviewing reords e. g, reviewing note or the text produce so far), \*self-monitoring (e.selfassessing whether the needed attention has been paid to the task or the target behaviour has occurred), self-instructions (eg., maintaining a running conversation with themselves to reflect on the tasks and evaluate their work) and \*time planning" (p. 188). Despite the ample research on slf-regulation in writing, scholars have directed their attention to bilingual students only in the past few decades (Tse et al., 2022).

Few research focusing on self-regulation has revealed that translanguaging can contribute positively to self-regulation learning. Freihofner et al's (2018) study shows that introducing German to a technology-enhanced English-medium content and language integrated lening (C) bology class n a high school fforded students moreacces to self-regulatory strategies. While encountering unknown German terms, the students sought translation strategie to monitor their accuracy, motivating them to review their current knowledge and strengthening their selfefficacy in foreign language learning. The use of translanguaging in guided classroom discussion and unplaned student learning also enhanced peer cooperation, encouraged self-evaluation and boosted self-eficacy beliefs in language use and content comprehension.

Despite the smal number of studies, the line of inquiry focusing on translanguaging also identifie it close association with elf regulation. In their study, Le and Garcia (2020) note that translanguaging was adopted by Korean-American first graders to manipulate their cognitive process in writing, revealing their metacognitive awareness Similarly, through analysing five written texts from bilingual children in the Us, Velasco and Garcia (2014) ague that translanguaging alows bilinguals toself-regulate their writing process facilitating learning. So far, previous studies have dmonstrated that the exposure to multilingual resources benefits students self-regulation development, and translanguaging can work as an effective self-regulation strategy for children's writing in primary and secondary education. The idea of self-regulation provides us with a perspective that connects the observed translanguaging practices at ifferent writig stages in our study, and aso contributes to the limited understanding of self-regulation behaviour among bilingual students during the L2 writing process beyond primary and secondary education.

# 2.3. A model of the writing process

Both first language (L1) and second/foreign language (L2) writing comprises more than one activity with individuals moving back and forth between different tges (Moragne Moragnee ilva, 1988; Zamel, 1983). In academic writig, reding is oten incorporated into the writing process which is relected in the model of reading-to-write test task developed by Plakans (2008). Plakans divides the writing proces into two recurring main stages, prewriting and witing. The prewriting stage includes activities such as unpacking the writing tasks, interacting with the source texts and organizing the content, which is relatively linear. The writing stage consists of "writing, planning, rehearsing phrases, and rereading source texts" (p.117); and writers often move back and forth between these activities. Although Plakans' (2008) model provides a general framework, it does not consider the uniqueness of the master's dissertation writing process which involes activities such as data collection and analysis, and often stretches over an extended period of time. Drawing on Plakans model and tailoring ito our knowledge about the issrtation writing process we identified thre phases within the writing stage: note-taking, outlining and drating, which were recorded by the research participants as texts" before their final drafts. This served as a data analysis framework in this study.

# 2.4. Translanguaging in academic writing

In the second/foreign language writing proces, bilingual/multilingual writers adopt dfferent strategies, some of which are shared with writers who operate only in L1. For instance, both 1 and L2 writers adopt \*writerly reading" (Hirvela, 2004) (reading source texts to polish expressions), and mining (reading for selecting information for a specific goal) in source-based writing (e.g, Hirvela, 2004; Lo, 2011 Plakans & Geril, 2012). Bilingual writers tend to fuly tap into their wide linguistic repertoire in their writing, which reflects the recursive writing process. Previous literature shows L1 and L2 can be oserved both in the writing process (.g., Wodall 2002) and product (e.g., Canagarajah, 2011a). In the writing proces, bilingual writr are found to generate a lis of synonyms in L1 and retrieve them in L2 in order to search for the appropriat lexical terms and articulate their ideas precisely (Wang, 2003). Sometimes, instead of spending time searching for words, bilingual writers expres their ideas in their L1 and continue writing before coming back to translate the words or phrases into thir target language at the end (Velasco & Garcia, 2014). Occasionall, bilingual writers review and translate the already written L2 texts into L1 to assess the appropriateness of meanings (Wang, 2003), which are known as backtracking and back-translatio respectively. Although translanguaging is prevalent in the writing proces, it i found that the frequency of language activation varies from person to person, and is closely related to the relevant contexts and writers (Gunnarsson et al., 2015). The status of a language in the community and the writers high proficiency level in that language ofe leads to its strong presence across different stages in writing.

Although some of the above-discussed studies do not use the term translanguaging, they point out that language mixing benefits bilingual writers infacilitatig their writing process; and how it is employed is influenced by the writing stages and local contexts. Research carried out with an explicit translanguaging lens has found similar results. Velasco and Garcia (2014) examined the specific function ftranlanuaging in ch tge f writing i., lanning, dring and prction) b reiewing five writen texts composed by primary school students in dual language bilingual education programmes. In planning, the students actively engaged with a wide range of multimodalities and switched to other languages for glossing and acquiring new vocabulary. During drafting, translanguaging was adopted for word retrieal and transformation (changing the ending of a book by rearranging the elements in atext). In their final products, translanguaging was used to achieve rhetorical engagement and efectiveness Velasco and Garcia (2014) conclude that translanguaging serves as an efficient self-regulatory strategy and has the potential for developing academic writing.

In the writing product, the switching of codes is rarely associated with formal registers at the university level unless a translanguaging-friendly space is explicitly provided for the writers (e.g., Canagarajah, 2011a). This might be because writing in educational sttings i often considered a high-stakes formal activity, and is rlated to evaluation of student performance (Canagarajah, 2011b).

Research on translanguaging in the writing processin higher education is relatively limited. The existing scholarship in this topic focuses on academic genres such as essays (e.g., Chen et al, 2019), year-end report (e.g., Adamson & Coulson, 2015), and reading responses and research proposals (e.g., Chen, 2017). Only a few studie focus on master's level disertation writing. For example, Kaufhold (2018) studied the lived experiences of students in completing their master's disertation at a Swedish university, showing that institutional policies, interaction betwen supervisor and student, and between peers have an impact on students capacity to engage with their varied repertoire. In their research, Adamson et al. (2019) touch on how translanguaging plays a role in the interaction between students and supervisors. The studies above focus on the influencing factors and key interactions related to dissertation writing, but do not stematically explore the writing process. The writing proces of master's issertations is therefore still under-researched in translanguaging studies.

# 3. Methodology

With the intention of deepening our understanding of the translanguaging practices of Chinese students in their master's disser. tation writing in the UK, this study aimed to answer the following question: \*How and why do the Chinese students translanguage in

each phase of their dissertation writing process?"

In 2020/21, mainland Chinese students accounted for about $1 9 \%$ of all full-time postgraduate taught (PGT) students in the UK, with about $2 6 \%$ in Scotland (Higher Education Statistics Agency [HESA], 2023). This pattern was reflected in the universty in this study where Chinese students made up the largest percentage of postgraduate students in the schol of education. Therefore, understanding their dissertation writing process could provide upervisors and EAP teachers with valuable information for their tutoring and teaching activities.

To recruit students, the first author emailed the information shees to allthe Chinese postgraduate students in her network who were studying in the school of education, inviting them to take part in the study. Those who were contacted were encouraged to identify further potential participants and also forward the information sheet to them. Through snowball sampling, ten students responded to the email and were initiall rcruited, and the texts they produced during their disertation writing werecollected. After reviewing the texts, ive students were selected for the research as translanguaging could be observed in their texts. The other five students were not included as they could only offer the final writing products where no written evidence of translanguaging was present. However, it i worth noting that the five students who were not included in this study also stated that they employed Chinese/ English translanguaging in the writing process.

The five recruite students are referred to as Participant 1 (P1) to Participant 5 (P5) in the remaining sections of this paper. The texts they submitted contained five outlines, two sets of reading notes and three drafts as shown in Table 1.

Once the texts were colected, they were divided into three groups, i.e, reading notes, outlines and draft based on the writing stages. Within each group, translanguaging practices were identified and the initial categorisation was conducted based on the frequently presented forms (e.g., use of mathematic symbols, simultaneous use of Chinese and English of the same phrases, the frequent presence of English technical terms in Chinese-based outlines and draft). The categorised practices were further interpreted by the first author, from which the initial themes emerged.

Similar to the moment analysis approach (se: Wei, 2011; Wei & Zhu, 2013), this study did not aim to uncover the universal patterns and regularity, revealing the underlying principles of language users choices, but was more interested in the spontaneous, impromptu, and momentary action and performances of the individual" (Wei, 2011, p. 3). This approach allowed us to explore the potentially highly personal and even idioyncratic translanguaging practices, and to understand the crativity and criticlit displayed in the bilingual writers' texts (Wei, 2011).

In addition to the text analysis, to understand how the participants make sense of their world, the dual interpretation process known as the \*double hermeneutic from interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) (Spiers & Smith, 2019) was used. This has been employed by previous studies and proved to be an effective analysis tool in investigating the complexities of translanguaging practice (see: Tai & Wong, 2022; Tai, 2022; Tai, 2023). Individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews were held between the participants and the firt author. The review of the texts served as a starting point for the interviews, where the first author sought interpretation and contextual information for the instances f translanguaging practice in the texts and asked the participants about their translanguaging practice in the other writing phases which were not necessarily shown in the collected texts.

No restrictions were imposed on the choices of language for the interviews. Translanguaging, a strategy used by bilinguals to make sense of the world (Garcia, 2009a), was welcomed with the purpose of generating rich data and maximise communicative potential (Garcia, 2009b). The interviews provided extra information to validate the initial data analysis, adding an emic perspective, and sometimes leading to re-interpretation and re-categorisation of the texts. The emic perspective generated from the dual interpretation processallowed us to move away from the traditional monolingual perspective and adopt a translanguaging lens. During the analysis, examples of inner pech were identified by the first author when the interviews or the texts provide evidence that certain texs carried a self-directed orientation or personal and idiosyncratic meanings.

Due to the shared linguistic and educational background, the first author took advantage of her insider position and knowledge to quickly establish a close rapport with the participants during the interviews, and obtained an in-depth understanding of the data during the analysis. Meanwhile, she was aware of the potential risk of imposing her insider knowledge on the data interpretation process and ignoring valuable findings due to her familiarity with the participant. We believe the dual intrpretation proces that we drew upon, and the first author's discussion with the second author (who considers himself as an outsider), mitigated this potential issue and improved the reearch validit, a it allowed two additional voices (from the participants and from the second author) to be integrated into the analysis and enabled th irt author to keep critical distance from the data hrough a cros-referencing of the two sources of data and criticall reflcting on our positions, we were able to associate the texts with the writers and contexts and better understand how the participants drew on their multilingual repertoire in the academic writing process.

# 4. Results and discussion

In the following section, the common useof translanguaging acros note-taking, outlining and drafting in the writing stage wil first be presented, followed by a discussion of the unique use of translanguaging in the note-taking and drafing phases respectively. Because the translanguaging practice identified in the outlines can also be found in the reading notes and draft, translanguaging during the outlining phase is not presented individually. No explicit translanguaging was reported in the final products and therefore no data is presented for that stage.

4.1. Translanguaging in the writing stage: Engaging the semiotic repertoire to illustrate logical relationships

The students drew on languages and mathematical symbols to reach writing goals. The following examples\* demonstrate this practice in the note-taking, outlining and drafting phases respectively.

# 4.1.1. Excerpt 1 (Reading note, P1)

But i.limit 'But because it is a language book, not a culture book :. the limitations can be understood'

4.1.2. Excerpt 2 (Outline, P1)

4.1.3. Excerpt 3 (Draft, P2)

$\hbar \Im C H + C A J ,$ #!CAJ 2 'Add $C H + C A J ,$ particularly CAJ 2'

$^ { * } I n$ this article, the original texts and interview transcripts are presented in italic while the translations of the texts and interviews are placed in single quotes.

The mathematical symbols ., "., and " $+ \ '$ found in the script were used to simplify the expressions and save time for information generation. Their functio of facilitating information production is supported by P1's and P2s interview data. Additionall, P1 stated that the symbols are eye-catching and can clearly illstrate the logicl relationships between different subject, which reduces the time needed for information searching and processing when she returned to the text. This shows that translanguaging helped students reduce the cognitive load and regulate the recursive writing process.

This linguistc reertoire seemed to be used in a personal and elliptical manner, afeature which is evident in iner speech (Flower, 1979). This feature is particularly salient in Excerpt 3. When asked about the mathematical symbol $+$ ' in her draft, P2 said:

P2, interview: [..] CH means the Chinese journal, the Chinese writing. And CAJ means . um the format of the document. It is CAJ rather thanPDF.z  ave both PD fot d CJ format... lus mens um . rt itis ocment, a il. nd theni is the ma] part of it. Plus means CAJ belongs to CH.

In the initial text analysis, it was difficult to decipher the meaning of the abbreviations and the symbol $^ +$ (plus). P2's explanations show that they carry personal meanings to herelf indicating that translanguaging constitutes part of abilingual writers iner peech.

4.2. Translanguaging in the writing stage: Conveying meaning more precisely and efficiently

One feature in allthe submitted texts is that key technical terms were frequently used in English, which was also mentioned by P2 and P5 in the interviews.

# 4.2.1. Excerpt 4 (Reading note, P3)

L2 acquisitiontF

'the benefits for L2 acquisition'

In L2 acquisition, FS are also relied on initially as a quick means to be communicative, albeit in a limited way, both to children and adults. (p.12).

# 4.2.2. Excerpt 5 (Outline, P5)

CLJ EX, 5 COLLABORATIVE INTERACTIONAJT 'the definition of CL, its differences from collaborative interaction'

In Excerpt 4 and 5, the technical terms or their abbreviations such as "L2 acquistion, \*CL' and "collaborative interaction" were found in English. According to the interviews, two main reasons accounted for the students preference for English technical terms. First, using English reduced ther cognitive load because they acquired the subject knowledge through the medium of English and were more familiar with the English terms.

P5, interview: Those English words, they are technical terms. The jounal I rad presents them in English. I mean, my input is English so my output is influenced by it.

The bilingual writers previous communication experience has influenced their production of language. As the activation of certain languages i usually closely relate to their statuses in their ocal contexts (Gunnarson et l., 2015), the popular sts of English in the academic community leads to its strong presence in students' writing.

Second, English was adopted to distinguish the subtle difference between the technical terms. P5 further explained her trans languaging in Excerpt 5:

P5, interview: For example, if you said cooperative leaning and collaborative leaning you can diferntiate them clearly. But if you translate them into Chinese: 1FtJ. It is the same word. We cannot tell the differences from the word.

P5 showed the self-regulation abilit to monitor the accuracy of her expressions and appreciated the subtle meaning differences between the terms in English: cooperative and collaborative, which arguably stemmed from her capacity to compare Chinese and English. Her bilingualism supported the development of her selfregulation strategy, which in turn led to translanguaging practice.

P2, interview: ,##X 4Ji\*x. 1\*XT#3\*i#[]##t#\*\*X#h-#+X.

For instance, when I am writing a draft, my draft might mainly use English. Because of that, I might til use English for annotation or something els out f habit. But sometimes English cannot fully expres my ideas [. then I wl dd some Chinese to my nglish draft.

Although P2's choice of language was influenced by the main language used in the writing phase, she stil translanguaged when necessary. This highlights the integrated nature of Chinese and English in her repertoire as they work together to allow for more accurate expresion of ideas. Translanguaging enables the writers to regulate the accuracy and efficiency of their writig. Trans. languaging is inflenced by the writing phase, the local context and the writer's desire to achieve accurate expressions eficiently.

4.3. Translanguaging in the note-taking phase: preparing meaningful information for content and expressions

Our data shows that students translanguaged in note-taking to capture meaningful information.

4.3.1. Excerpt 6 (Reading note, P3)

However scholars have used a wide range of teminology for the phenomenon, terminology 3, and the research has been scattered across various fields.   
'too many'

4.3.2. Excerpt 7 (Reading note, P3)

'the criteria'

Sch p. 35 For intenal validit, there is a need for a clear definition of what a formulaic string is. Where possble, there should be methodological triangulation.

Lexicon (Wray, p. 43) it may simply be that identification cannot be based on a single critrion, but rather needs to draw on a suite of featres. Wray lexicon, p. 44): identification of formulaic sequences in text is extremely dificult, lrgely eause of the absence of any single definition able to capture all the relevant features at once.

In the two examples above, translanguaging was used to summarise the content of a longer sentence (Excerpt 6) or a small paragraph (Excerpt 7). This use of translanguaging was mentioned in the interviews by P1, P2 and P3 who believed that the introduction of Chinese facilitated their information processing when they returned to their notes later.

P3, interview: So I take notes in my first language, I will read more. I will read faster and more quickly. And then I can read more literature in the limited amount of time.

In the interviews, P3, P4 and P5 also pointed out that Chinese stands out in the English-based reading notes due to the dierences oetween the Chinese characters and English letters.

P4, interview: 11J#i. -X\$ib-+X#iR,TT [..] -#,1,1R. #X\$+X1RRBJ.

'You will notice the words easily because the Chinese words are very eye-catching in an English draft. They willcatch your attention nytime when you are rereading your text [.. It is ik, you know, rell reminding you. The Chinese really stands out among lots of English words.'

The students selected key information from the content of a text, a reading strategy known as "mining'" in source-based writing (Hirvela, 2004). The mined words are written in Chinese for ease of information processing, reducing the time spent at this stage. Meanwhile, the writerskilfull capitalise on the different forms of Chinese and English to better capture their attention, facilitating the location of information when they return to the texts.

In addition, English appears to be the main language found in the collected notes. P3 provided the following explanation:

P3, interview. Cuz maybe they (the writers of the reading sources) [..] use words that are more complex, more cceptable. Ican lear that in my own assignment [..] if I keep the English version, mainly because that I may use that in my own assignments.

P3's explanation shows the writers atentiveness to the language aspect of writing, using sources to polish the language. This source-processing strategy is known as \*writerly reading (Hirvela, 2004). Writerly reding is not only directed to the authors but also to the target readers of the disertation, working beyond the writer's inner speech. When ths occurs, no L1 or semiotic resources appears to be found in the process, which might be due to the monolingual norm prevalent in academic communication.

In summary, translanguaging was adopted to facilitate the realisation of two reading strategies, "mining" and "writerly reading" (Hirvela, 2004) to efectively achieve their rhetorical and content writing goals. The combination of translanguaging and mining allows the uptake of more self-regulation strategie as it not only prepares the content for revision but also enables students to save time and better orient their attention during the revision process.

4.4. Translanguaging in the drafting phase: As a postponing strategy to retrieve information

The drafts and interviews of P2 and P5 show that Chinese postgraduate students translanguaged to postpone ideas which require further reading or data analysis.

# 4.4.1. Excerpt 8 (Draft, P2)

Second, the researcher emphasise DMs in the short dialogues (section 1) and long onversations (section 2) part without giving enough attention to the monologues (section 3)-#t ?

'Do I need to propose a solution?'

\$#JDMJX 1R3##, TRF#,#R1general, i##Et01.

Some DM can have more than one meaning. I only ategorised it in a general manner. I sill ned to divide it into more subcategories.

P2 conducted her writing without ollowing a linear sequence, using translanguaging to mark the unfinished tasks. According to P2's interview, in order to solve the questions emerging from the text (Excerpt 8) and to achieve her plan (Excerpt 9), she needed to consult books, peers or teachers, which could have afected her thought flow; therefore, she turned to translanguaging to address this issue. According to P2, the texts were directed to her, therefore working as a manifestation of P2's self-instruction and an external presentation of her inner speech:

P2, interview: This is just like the hint for me. I mix them for highlighting, for reminding me to pay more attention to this part

The postponing strategy enabled P2 to continue drafting while reminding her of the unfinished parts. This is particularly usefu considering the extensive process of disertation writing. Similarly, P5 switched to Chinese to indicate the unfinished task.

According to P5, translanguaging allowed her to progress in her writing before the research result emerged. The process of dissertation writing involves more complex activities such as reading, data collction and analysi compared to general academic writing and therefore a postponing strategy was used beyond the word level, which is diffrent from the findings in Velasco and Garcia's study (2014).

The examples in this ection ofer a glimpse into the bilingual writer's iner speech which appears to involve translanguaging. The inner speech did not only facilitate the selfegulation process but aso worked as a self-reulation strategy itelf, known as self-instruction'" (Harris et al., 2011), through which writers reflect on their current writing stages and plan their future tasks.

4.5. Translanguaging in the drafting phase: translating technical terms to activate the knowledge in L1

In P2's draft, the English technical term, \*topic-switcher appeared simultaneously with the Chinese translation \*#3i.

4.5.1. Excerpt 11 (Draft, P2)

DMs specify the roles of utterance

#3i topic-switcher   
'topic-switcher'   
well, anyway

In the interview, P2 explained that her choices were influenced by the topic of the essay and the monolingual norms i literacy activities.

P2, interview: In thisessay I inestigate thecollege Englis text in China [.] I ned to read the Chinee author's journal. I ight hae read some Chinese jounal before, but I canot match them [.. Imagine you come across a new term like topic-witching' But maybe in your undergraduate study, you have studied it before, you just don't know its English expression. So when you know both the English expression and Chinese expression. You can, um like a schemata. You can have more information for it.

In order to discuss educational issues in a Chinese context, P2 needed to consult Chinese journals and her previous subjet knowledge in Chinese allowed her to locate useful materias and quickly obtain a beter understanding of the corrsponding English reading materials. Translanguaging allowed her to turn her previous learning experiences in L1 into valuable resources. This did not only facilitat achieving her writing goal but also potentially boosted her elf-fficacy in relation to the writing content, which is another important construct of self-regulation (Freihofner et al., 2018).

Meanwhile, the need to translanguage to draw on the knowledge in L1 indicates that the dominant monolingual norm in education could potentilly lead to a disconnection between bilingual students previous knowledge and that of their current study. As a result there i a risk for the relevant local knowledge represented through intenational students' L1 to be marginalised, placing the students at a disadvantage in terms of academic achievement. Translanguaging was adopted by P2 to both regulate her writing and overcome the challenges that emerged from the monolingual norm.

4.6. Translanguaging in the drafting phase: glossing and vocabulary acquisition

P4's draft illustrates that she translanguaged to gloss certain words.

P4, interview: EX1+X, #i1, 13Mreference J8 , eJAJ1FtBX#Jt\$,1ZjBo

Actually, I dont use Chinese that often in my draft. I only doso when I come across unknown words. For example, sometimes the words ! sa in the refenc ist are diffiul. I no quote thm, so I neo kow wht they men. o, I willnote them down nd look them up inthe dictionary. I wll write down the corresponding Chinese meaning beside them. Because I need to know the meanings of those words to generate the following text. So, I won't delete the Chinese meaning until I produce the final draft'.

Glossing benefited P4 in literature comprehension, text generation and vocabulary acquisition. Academic writing can difer from general writing because it ofen includes language which contains a high frequency of unknown words. For P4, translanguaging addressed the potentialissue where she might forget the meaning of a new word, which is more likely to occur i dissertation writing because of the extensive period of time needed for the process The translanguaging practice saved P4 from having to check the dictionary again in future, potentially serving as a \*time planning" self-regulation strategy (Harris et al., 2011).

# 5. Conclusions

This paper explored translanguaging across the note-taking, outlining and drafting phases of the postgraduate student disertation writing proces. The prevalent use oftranslanguaging reveals a more translanguaging-friendly space evident in the private writig process and supports the integrated nature of different linguistic and semiotic resources in the bilingual writer's repertoire.

Six translanguaging practices were found to be used: i) to llustrate the relationship between different piece f information i) to efficiently achieve more accurate expressions; i) to prepare the content and language through mining and writerly reading; iv) to activate L1 knowledge in response to the monolingual norms; v) to rerieve information, and vi) to gloss Some of these practices are closely related to the dissertation writing genre and add to the existing scholarship about written translanguaging.

Through translanguaging, students capitalised on both forms and meanings of English and Chinese, engaged with the semiotic resources flexibly, satisfying both their current needs and the global writing goals. The findings also revealed that translanguaging supported students uptake of more self-regulation strategies. The students' bilingualism enabled them to beter monitor their use of time, attention orientation, note organisation and text planning, to efectively control the extensive dissertation writing process and achieve their writing goals. The use of translanguaging also has the potential to enhance students' selfefficacy. Therefore, translanguaging works as an important self-regulation tool and helps students to develop their self-regulation strategies in academic writing.

In addition, our data showed evidence of students engaging in self-oriented, highly personal dialogue, indicating that trans. Ianguaging constituted part of the bilingual students' inner spech which appeared to also function as a self-regulation strategy. Moving beyond the inner speech, students also adopted translanguaging to prepare for future communication with the wider community, regulating their writing to achieve their established rhetorical goal.

The acknowledgement of translanguaging as aself-regulation tool and it role in developing self-regulation in academic writing has further implications and significance in EAP programmes at internationalised British and Anglophone universities. Our study acknowledges the value of diverse linguistic and semiotic resources and the relevant knowledge international students bring. These resources and knowledge could be potentially quandered due to the dominant monolingual norm. As result, this study highlights the need to challenge and renegotiate traditional monolingual EAP with the hope of opening up new spaces for the voices and identities of international students in EAP.

We believe that it is important for EAP tutors and supervisors to view translanguaging as a part of abilingual writer self-regulation strategy to control the complex writing processinstead of aresult of dfit language proficiency; and to encourage translanguaging in the writing proces. It s adviable for eucaors to actively sek olutions to address the isues stmming from the dominant postion of monolingual norms in both British and Chinese academic writing communities For instance, supervisors and EAP tutors who share the language of their supervisees and students could potentily help thir learners to activate their previous knowledge by introducing and discussing academic content bilingually. For those teachers who do not share the same language with students, they coul till encourage the use of source materials in different languages in student writing, and promote peer discussion of those materials bilingually. In adition, teachers are encouraged to teach students self-regulation skills and incoporate translanguaging into this teaching and learning proces considering that self-regulation plays a significant role in promoting students writing performance, which can be developed and enhanced through effctive instructions (Harri et al., 2011) and be better supported through the use of translanguaging.

The current research focused on translanguaging practices in the academic writing process. Although translanguaging is often found to occur naturally without explicit instruction, notion known as "translanguaging instinct (Wei, 2018), Canagarajah (2011b) argues that this does not mean translanguaging does not need to be taught. By having a better understanding of translanguaging practices in dissertation writing, this article provides Teaching English to the Speakers of Other Languages (TEsoL)/EAP researchers and practitioners with more information to better capitalise on this phenomenon and turn them into useful teaching resources. Increasing efort in developing \*pedagogical interventions that include translanguaging (Cenor & Gorter, 2015, p. 9) has been wit nessed in the current field and should continue to be encouraged in future research. Additional inquiry should also be made into translanguaging in other genres of writing to understand how it plays a role both in the writing process and product.
