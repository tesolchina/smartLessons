Keywords:   
Task representation   
Argumentative writing   
Integrated writing   
Epistemic belief   
Source use

Task representation denotes students' interpretation in which what a learning or assessment task required them to do. An argumentative integrated writing task which involves the use of reading materials as claims or evidences for composing an essay, makes the role of task representation more critical than others, as writers may be confused with whether their task is to focus on synthesizing the reading materials that they comprehend, or expressing their own views. With the aim of exploring the characteristics of task representation and its association with integrated writing, this study invited 474 secondary four students from Hong Kong to participate in think aloud writing protocol followed by stimulated recall interview (36 participants), and complete an integrated writing task and a questionnaire (438 participants). Three factors of the task representation were identified as source use, rhetorical purpose and text format, and significant positive correlations were found between the three factors and integrated writing performance. Theoretical and pedagogical implications are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

In an integrated writing task, writers tap on reading, istening, and/or speaking skills and accessource materialsas stimuli for composing anessy. Given this unque feare f an inteatd anguag tsk hat writing skill neto be usd in ally withther skill, integrated writing task proved to be cognitively challenging, especiall for lessproficient writrs (Allen, 2004; Liao et al., 2021; Wolfersberger, 2013). Novice writer are often confused bout whether they should generate their essays by incorporating the accesed information and their own opinions, recall and summarize the source materials, or disregard the source materials and mostl focus on composing their own written product. As academic assgnments are typically written with rich rhetorical context as in an integrated writing task (Flower, 1990), learners who understand the task requirements inaccurately may approach it wrongly, their effrt go to waste, and their academic performance adverely afected. Researchers therefore delved into understanding the writers interpretation of writing task.

The term \*ask representation (TR) denotes students interpretation of a learning or assesment activity. Itis amost the first step a writer takes when composing for classroom assgnments or asessment tas (Plakans, 2010; Wolfersberger, 2007), \*creating an understanding of what sills product, and processes the task requires and make a plan of action that willead to a written product that appropriately fulflls the writing task" (Wolfersberger, 2007, p.73). Whileit is the first step to take, it does not mean that the writers halt at formulation of this understanding and move on to compose. Research proved that i is a highly iterative process (Flower tein et al., 1990. Especially in the case of integrated writing, when the writers command a series of decision makings in deducing the relevance of the information from multiple sources, making inferences between and across documents integral to writing (Segev-- Miller, 2007). Therefore, TR is legitimately assumed to evolve throughout the whole writing process.

Given the complexit of TR formation, this study is motivated to bring to light the impact of TR on integrated writing performance. We consulted two strands of research. The firs resides in the writing context, which shows that students' prior knowledge of topic, writing skills and their approach on the source materials in tandem contributed to the etablishment of TR (Plakans & Liao, 2018). Although this strand of rech uneils the difficulties studnt fad in decipheing the nessy sts to take and illustraes a wide variation of TR (Flower, 190; Ruiz-Funes, 2001), it had yet thoroughly investigate the extent f its impact on writing performance. The second concerns multiple-text reading comprehension, which demonstrated that individual differences in epistemic belief ffect the comprehension of the reading sources, and seemingly suggested a relationship between a stronger belief and better outcomes (Wiley et al., 2020). While most of these studies are set in the context of science and history subjects learning using multiple documents, ess is known about language assessment. In this regard, we incorporated these two strands of research to uncover writers epistemic beliefs when attempting argumentative integrated writing tasks, which have become a commonly used writing assessment task. This article reports our attempt to identify the characterisics of TR of an argumentative integrated writing task and explore its value on assessment outcomes.

# 1.1. Task representation in integrated writing

TR refers to the processa writer understands the task demands and decide on the approaches when given a writing task (Plakans & Liao, 2018). With the reading sources, the writer will be involved in reading, interpreting, synthesizing, and using the relevant information, and writig their own statement in an extended, reterative (Smeet & Sole, 2008) and inerrelatednes of comprehending and composing proceses (Ackerman, 1991). On this ccount, th formulation of TR may enforce greater demands on the writer than a solely writing one, i., independent writing task, and this may be far more impactful than we could imagine. For this reason, TR has caught the attention of both first (L1) and second (L2) languages writing researchers.

Flower's (1990) study was among the first to present an overview of TR, signifiying the infancy of the notion of TR. Her work analysed undergraduate and postgraduate students class work and identified variations of the choice students made acros each of the following domains: major source of information, text format and feature, organizing plan, strategies, and writig goals. Ackerman (1991) identified the importance of topic knowledge on TR and the subsequent written product. By dividing the participants into high-knowledge and low-knowledge writers, he revealed the high-knowledge group used more evaluative elaborations and were more aware of the rhetorical context. On the other hand, the low-knowledge group paid attention to the structural and content-based knowledge in the source materials, and borrowed implicitly from the source materials to compose. In a more recent case study, Smeet & Soles (2008) used the concepts of knowledge-transformation and knowledge-telling (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987) to represent their postgraduate participants' diffrent interpretations of the task requirements. They uncovered that students with the knowledge-transforming TR used more intra- and intertextual integration than those with a knowledge-telling TR.

Researchers observed writers revisiting the task prompts as described by Plakans (2012) as acircular process of undertsanding of the tasks. Compared with independent writing task, the rhetorical context of an integrated writing task is much longer in length and more complex in content, and thus may play a greater role in interpreting on how to aproach the task. Flower (1990) scrutinized L1 students organizing plans for writing and concluded that their plans were dominated by a rhetorical purpose of fulfilling the various parts of an essay, e.g., conceptualizing introductory and concluding paragraphs, and paraphrasing the source texts to generate a topic sentence at the start of each paragraph. Similarly in L2, Plakans et al. (2019) recorded prevalent metacognitive and vocabulary-focusing processes that students underwent when attempting an integrated writing task.

As compared to L1 writers, L2 writers presented an even wider spectrum of TR for integrated writing. The L2 participants in Ruiz-Funes (2001) study presented a range of written product varied from mere summarization, summarization with comments, an interpretation with a rhetorical purpose, with only very few students synthesizedthe source materials. By following a novice L2 leaner for one semester, Alle (2004) revealed that although the learner activiated her prior knowledge in order to integrat her own ideas in with the source materials, her lack of academic writing experience limited her interpretation of the writing prompts, and thus, failed to fulfill the requirements of some of the writing assignments.

Plakans (2010) compared the participants' TRs of independent and integrated writing, and unveiled that only those who formu. lated different TRs closely examined the source texts to look for ideas for writig and actively involved themselves in synthesizing the source texts. This study points to the significance of source use in TR of integrated writing. Not surprisingly, L2 writing research concerns itelf with writers' limited linguisic abilities prompted further research on higher education students' citation behaviours. Petric and Harwood (2013 observed the more successful writers strongly stred their efort towards fulilling their TR by citing information across multiple readings as they percieved their purposes of citation should depend on the ways they interpret the task requirements. On the other hand, the less sccesful students tended to merely duplicate the information found in the source materials or paraphrase (Hyland, 2009). For instance, Wolfersberger (2013) reported that two of the four participants copied a great deal of content without appropriate citation or paraphrasing. The interviews of both participants revealed their misinterpretation of the task requirements. They were uncler f the expectations on source use, such as paraphrasing, which resulted inthe plagiarism. Relating to the writers cultural background, Basham et l.(1993) opined that cultural differences may impact on the understanding of the writing requirements. Cheng's (2009) study provided evidence that Chinese participants eicited main ideas in the source materials by paying attention to how the texts were organized first, and then looked for supporting evidences from the text to connect with those ideas. This strategy of observing the text oganization of the sources indicated that the Chinese writers prioritied their attention to text format in their reading and writing processes.

While we gained insights about TR in writing research, we also observed that ths strand of study mainly employed think-aloud protocols, clas observations, interviews and textual analysis of the reading materials and writen products, and less is conducted using quantitative methods to uncover TR's impact on writing performance. Hence, we consulted a related research theme on epistemic belief in multiple-text comprehension, which shed more light on this relationship.

# 1.2. Epistemic beliefs in multiple-text comprehension

In a related field, research on multiple-texts comprehension and argumentation explored on the epistemic beliefs of readers, and brought to light the extent of its impact on literacy achievements. Learners' epistemic beliefs, that is, their views about the nature of knowledge and the processof knowing, may shape the proces and performance a person takes when presented with a learning task (Barzilai & Zohar, 2014).

Discusing on science-related epistemological beliefs, Braten et al. (2011) found that the les one holds a simplistic belef about knowledge, the more they willdefine the goal state of a multiple-source task as one of creating an integrated, coherent representation by means f corroboration. Similarl, Bromme et al. (2010, p. 15) argued that \*sophisticated" eistemological beles allow for better or more adequate apprehension of the content and thereby also more appropriate sandards for goalsetting. More recently, Wile et al. (2020) found that learners who view knowledge as complex and tentatie are more likely to form connections between texts, integrate information from multiple texts, self-regulate their reading of multiple texts, and therefore achieve beter comprehension of multiple documents.

In language tasks, studies indicated that epistemic beliefs concerning the nature of knowing may underlie killed argumentation by the way writers justify their arguments (Glassner et al., 2005). This body of work measures epistemic beliefs as a continuum from absolutist, multiplist and evaluativis stances, esentilly describes the development of justification as progressing through a mainly personal to an evaluative state where awareness of rules of inquiry and what counts as evidence in the domain makes them realized that some claims are beter justified as knowledge than others. Whileusing information presented in multiple texts to compose an argumentative essay, middle school students who showed more evaluative disposition in organizing the information demonstrated better results (Braten et a., 2011). Brit et al. (2014) found that readers are affected by the cues presented in multiple-texts reading tasks, as they can interpret \*explaining how and why" as an answer-seeking task or as an explanation-construction task, which in tun determines the types of activitie and strategies they employ. The aforementioned literature provides new insights into conceptualizing students TR by considering their epistemic beliefs. Further exploration is needed to identify ways to operationalise the elicitation of epistemic beliefs in our study of TR of an integrated writing task.

Following Hofer and Pintrich's (1997) influential conception of the four dimensions of personal epistemology that had notably endorsed the measurement of epistemic belefs, Greene et l. (2008) opined that as epistemology operates around how claims can be justified b knowledge, which is the justification for knowing dimension in Hofer and intrich's work. Justification for knowing refers to the acquisition of knowledge through interacting with people. Acording to Hofer and Pintrich's spectrum, it can range from justification of laims through authorit, to use of personal sense of what sems right. Greene et al. (2008) termed justification of knowing as epistemic cognition. Whereas the study of epistemic beliefs in multiple-text comprehension reaped frutful outcomes, it was not until Braten et al. (2013) study that we found the unveiling of epistemic cognition in the context of an argumentative writing context. The researchers operationalised the epistemic cognition of 51 undergraduates by coding their think-aloud data and found the predictability of justification of multiple sources as the unique factor on argumentation.

# 2. Research context and questions

Hong Kong includes integrated writing task into its language currculum in 2005 and conducted the first examination of integrated writing in 2007, as part of the Diploma of Secondary Examination, a public examination for university entrance. In this examination, test-takers read four texts, isten to one audio recording, and attempt a writing task using information from the reading and listening sources (HKEAA, 2017). Chinese language lessons are aso organized into modules that include a few reading texts and a writing task, with approximately six module taught in an academic year. Students are taught tocorroborate information acros reading texts and to express their views about them. As for writing, students are exposed to both independent and integrated writing tasks, with more independent ones arranged at the lower secondary levels, and gradually included more integrated writing tasks over the academic years. In view of treamlining public examination effrt, the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Examination intends to implement a simpler version of integrated writing task, requiring students to read two texts and write an esay. As previous research conducted on teachers found that students misunderstood the task requirements (Li et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021), it istimely to examine students TR, in order to inform on educational approaches and assessment reforms to bring the best out f the students in this new examination format.

We gained insights from the aforementioned studies that TR is afected by the writers' background knowledge of both the topic of the writing task and writing experience. Concurrently, the ask rhetorical context shaped the writers TR starting from considering the writing prompt and reading source materials, to the composition of the final wrtten product, in the aspects of linguistics, gere and use of ideas. Good writer concern themselves with connecting the ideas between the sources and their own prior knowledge. Whereas the qualitative studies provided insightful findings on TR of integrated writing, introducing the dimension of epistemic belief i sourcing of useful information in multiple-text reading comprehension wil add value to the field of study. Furthermore, the work of Bratenet al (2013) to operationalise justification of knowing inspired usto attempt to unveil the characterisic of TR and investigate the role of TR on IW performance with reference to their procedures. We asked the following questions:

RQ1. What are the characteristics of integrated writing task representation?

RQ2. What is the relationship between task representation and integrated writing performance?

# 3. Method

The current study adopted a mixed-method sequential design, wherein Phase One employed a qualitative approach; followed by Phase Two, which built upon the findings of Phase One using a quantitative approach (Johnson & Christensen, 2008). In Phase One, think-aloud writings were conducted followed by semi-structured interviews, emerging themes and patterns of students' TR of integrated writing were analysed. In Phase Two, a scale measuring TR generated from the results of Phase One was developed and the relation between TR and IW performance was examined. By integrating both qualitative and quantitative approaches, the study aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of TR and obtain insights that may not be attainable through single-method approaches alone.

# 3.1. Participants

474 secondary-four students from six schools participated in this study. Participants were sampled based on school bandings. A combination of other background variables such as gender, socio-economic backgrounds, distribution of schools and contexts were sought to include a variance of representation. Geographicall, wo schools (Band One & Band Two) were from Hong Kong Island, one (Band One) from Kowloon and three (1 BandTwo & 2 Band Three) from the New Territories. As both territory-wide currculum and public examination implemented integrated writing tasks, language teaching in schools incorporated it. At the time of data colection, students are in the third month of thir Secondary Four year. Whil students have exposure to the task type, they were not taught explicitly the strategies to deal with an integrated writing task in the seting of a DSE examination. All participants and their parents gave full consent voluntarily.

For Phase One, 36 out of 474 students with six from each schol were chosen by their teachers based on two criteria. The first is their overall language performance: students with 75th percentile or above grades representing good readers and writers, students with between 75th percentile and 25th percentile grades representing average readers and writers, and students with 25th percentile or below grades representing students facing challenges with reading and writig. Equal number f the students were selected from different level of language performance in order to represent the population of students with varied proficiency levels. Secondly, the selected students were identified as more vocal and thus more likely to reveal their thinking process during writing. The participants age ranged from 14 to 17 with an average of 15.09 years old and a standard deviation of .68. There were 21 male $( 6 1 . 7 6 \% )$ students. The demographic data about the participants is presented in Table 1 and they were anonymized and designated as S1-36.

For Phase Two, the rest of the 438 students participated. The average age of the participants was 15.05, with a standard deviation of .72. There were 282 males $( 6 4 . 4 \% )$

# 3.2. Instruments

# 3.2.1. Integrated writing (IW) task

The study adapted an IW task, comprising of a writing prompt and two reading passages, adapted from Cheong et al. (2019) The writing prompt required the participants to write an argumentative essay on the controverial issue of whether the priority seats in public transport are solely reserved for the elderly, disabled, pregnant, and injured at all times. The two reading pasages presented complementary and contrasting opinions on this ssue and covered varied genres. A pilot study was first conducted, in which eight students were required to complete the task in $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , and then each student was interviewed for clarity and precision of the task for $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ Based on students responses, the writing prompt and one of the reading texts were revised. Specificall, we revised the writing prompt from \*write an expository essay (#) to \*write an argumentative essay () s students responded that it was not clear to them what expository esay is For the reading texts, we revisited the reading materials and found that the content of positive viewpoints was longer than th negative ones and affected the stance students took. To adres this, adjustments were made toensure a balanced presentation of both viewpoints, thereby enhancing the opportunity of students expressing either complementary or contrasting opinions.

# 3.2.2. Interview protocol

An interview protocol was developed based on the above literature review for use in Phase One. This set of questions cover the (1) participants' understanding of the IW task; (2) justification of knowing when students approach the source materil, sub-divided it into justification by authorit, personal justificatio, and justification b multile oures; (3) the connctions betwethe soures and

with prior topic and writing knowledge; (4) writing prompt and its requirement, which also relate to argumentation text format.

# 3.2.3. TR Scale

Together with an expert group which includes two Chinese language literacy education experts and two experienced school teachers, the research team drafted a 23-items TR scale based on the review of relevant theoretical studies and the qualitative findings from Phase One. The items were designed on a 6-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). We designed a 6- point scale, rather than an odd-numbered-point scale, to avoid the central tendency bias, as East Asian students in the olectivist cultures tend to choose the midpoint (Johnson et al., 2005; Lee t al. 202). Moreover, a relatively long scale (e.g., a 6-point cale) is more sensitive and closer to a normal distribution (Leung, 2011).

The expert group scrutinized the TR scale for content validit, item precision, language clarity, and age appropriatenes. Furthermore, it was piloted witheight participant. Based on the students' interview responses on the readability and comprehensibility of the TR scale, specific item wordings were revised, and the inappropriate item was deleted. Students responded that the expressions of two items caused ambiguity and were not easy to understand. Therefore, we re-worded these items to improve their readability and acuracy. Specificall, we adjusted the wording of item 16 from \*The integrated writing task should be written in the form of summarizing and adding my own opinion' to I should make a clear viewpoint/proposition in each paragraph" and item 17 was revised from The integrated writing task should be written in aform with cler arguments and evidence' to The evidence in each paragraph of the integrated writing task should be clearly related to the arguments in that paragraph'. Furthermore, one item (i.e., I should write according to the topic and the information in the reading material) was removed because it interfered with multiple themes and its content duplicated other items. Therefore, the revised TR scale with 22 items was used for further analysis.

# 3.3. Phase one: think-aloud and interview

# 3.3.1. Data collection

The participants underwent think-aloud writing processfollowed by stimulated recall interviews. The think-aloud writing process followed the protocol and analysis developed by Ericsson and Simon (1993). The process had three parts, and each participant was accompanied by a researcher throughout the whole process. The first part was training. The participants were taught and demon. strated on how to use the think-aloud technique, and then practiced with a paragraph which is not related to the reading source of the IW task. The second part was using the technique while completing the IW task. During the proces, the researcher noted episodes relevant to the participants' TR. Based on Ericsson and Simon's (1993) findings, it is common for interviewers to use standardized reminders during interviews, typically occurring between $_ { 1 5 s }$ and one min. The interviewer used different cues depending on the duration of the silence. For shorter intervals of silence, around $1 0 s$ , the interviewer will tap on the table to signal the interviewee to speak. If the silence exceeds a longer duration, such as one minute, the interviewer prompts verbaly: \*please continue speaking" or "what is on your mind? We used this approach in order to minimize distractions, as the participants need to read the source materials and write their essas. In practice, i was found that silence typically did not exced 30s. The last part was the intrview, the W writen essay and the episodes noted by the interviewer were used as stimulito elicit the participants TR. The thre parts took approximately 15, 45, and 30 min respectively. Both the think-aloud writing and the interview data were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

# 3.3.2. Data analysis

The qualitative data was analysed by two independent raters using NVivo 12 software, and guided by the six stages of thematic analysis proposed by Kiger and Varpio (2020): familiaize with data, generate initial codes, search for themes, review themes, define the themes and produce the report. The rater used natural breaks in the transcript as cutting off points, and normally these breaks denote a change in topic (Corbin & Strauss, 2012). Thirty percent of the transcriptions were analysed first by the raters individully initial codes were identified, which consisted of word, phrases, or sentences that described students representation toward integrated writing tasks. These codes were subsequently compared and categorized into themes based on ther similarities and dissimlaritie. The themes wereaso guided by the iterature review which entails (1) Justification of knowing with justification by authority, by personal and by multiple sources; (2) Selecting information from the source origin; (3) Presenting in the writing; (4) Connections between the source materials and prior knowledge; (5) Focus from writing prompt; (6) Fulflling rhetorical purpose; (7) Presenting of argument elements in writte format. The first theme was inspired by the works of Braten et al. (2013), and Greene et al. (2008) in the field of epistemic belefs in multipl-text comprehension, while the rest were from the study of TR in L1 and L2 integrated writing. Following this, the two raters engaged in discussions to address disparities and uncertainties, and strive for consensus. The remaining $6 0 \%$ of the transcripts were also coded using the same process, with three additional rounds of discussion between the two raters. Overall an inter-rater rliabilit score of.998 was attained, which is \*the percentage of agrement of al coding decisions made by pairs of coders on which the coders agree"' (Lombard et al., 2002, p. 590).

# 3.4. Phase two: measurement of TR scale & IW task performance

# 3.4.1. Data collection

In Phase Two, the TR scale and IW task were administered on the same day in natural classroom tes settings. Students were asked to respond to the TR scale immediatel after completing the IW task to stimulate a ditted reresentation of the writing proess The IW task took $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and the TR scale took $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$

# 3.4.2. Scoring

Two raters scored allthe IW tass using a scoring rubric that has four criteria: a) contextual awareness, b) citations and synthesis, c) original opinions and argument, and d) written expressions and organization (Zhu, 2005). The score for each criterion is 10, and the task total up to 40. This scoring rubric has been widely used in Hong Kong public examination i.e., Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKEAA, 2017), and in previous studies (e., Cheong et al., 2018; hu et al., 2016). The two raters have rich experience in researching and teaching Chinese language, and they received training in scoring IW task. Three standardization meetings were held before formal scoring. During the meetings, the raters conscientiously discused the understanding and aplication of the scoring rubric, trial-marked scripts, refined the level descriptors in the rubric, and matched writing samples to the levels. The raters then used the finalized scoring rubric to score allthe scripts separately. The average of the two raters sub-scores were used as the score for the four dimensions f IW task. If the two raters' scores diverged by two points or more, the irst author served as a third rater. The third score was then averaged with the closest score marked by one of the original raters. The inter-rater reliability values for the four dimensions ranged from .91 to .93, and the Cronbach's a coefficient was .97.

# 3.4.3. Data analysis

To explore and validate the factor structure of TR scale, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using SPss 28.0 and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using Mplus 8.4 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998-2017) were conducted. The model fit was asessed using clasical goodnessof-fi indice, including Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square Eror of Approximation (RMSEA), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). TLI and CFI greater than .90, and RMSEA and SRMR lessthan .08, represent acceptable fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999. In addition, the Cronbach's alpha ) coeficient was calculated to evaluate the internal consistency reliailit of the scale. Based on rules of thumb, Cronbach's  cofficient above 8 isconsidered a good intenal consistency (Gliem & Gliem, 2003).

The validation of the structure f IW task was conducted using CFA, and the correlation between TR scale and IW performance was then explored to uncover the relationship between TR and IW performance.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Students' IW TR as found in think aloud and interview

After analysing the think-aloud $( T A )$ writing and interview (Int) transcripts, 581 idea units were coded and seven main themes relevant to students' TR were generated (see Table 2).

The first four themes, i.e. ustfication for knowing, use of information from the source origin, presenting the used information in writing, and integrating sources and prior knowledge in writing, are al related to the use of the source information. Majority of the idea units (241, $4 1 . 5 \%$ represented an integrated and coherent view on source use, and also demonstrated students' justification of knowing are more inclined towards justification by multiple sources (60, $1 0 . 4 \% )$ . The following participant's response indicated that she explicitl searched for information acrossthe texts guided by her belief that by doing so she can put across strong argument: I do not agree that priority seat should be only occupied by the elderly, so I looked for information in the two texts and use those that is consistent with my position. (when asked for the reason) Wel, that is what we should do in argumentative essays. The readers will not be convinced if ou produce your own evidence, they might hink it's ictional (20, Int). In adition, givethat the reding source materials provided concrete example of events relating to offering of sets in public transpor, some participants also fl back on thir personal feelings and relate to their personal knowledge and experience (51, $8 . 8 \%$ , as noted by the following interviewee: "I feel strongly for this traditional value, and  used my own life experience to suort my viewpoints because I think that it is very common and it ill be familiar to my readerstoo. In this way, we a relate to ach ther more and the reader will ant to readthe article more. so they won't stop halfway" (\$15,Int). However, it should be mentioned that the participant had already used the evidences provided in the two texts, but further added more personal ones with the aim of giving the essay a personal touch to atract readers. Regarding the ways to cite the reading materials, unlike most students chooing to paraphrase the sources or restate the original information in their essay to avoid plagiarism (82, $1 4 . 1 \%$ , there were 9 idea units $( 1 . 5 \% )$ coded in which students represent their thoughts that they would simply copy from the reading material.

The theme of focus on writing prompt is related to how the task condition affected students aproach to the task. Some students believe that all reading materials are presented with a specific purpose (23, $3 . 9 \%$ , and in a way, they struggled to reconcile with the different viewpoints presented in the reading sources. As the prompt requires the students to assume the role of an editor of a magazine, students extensively discussed about their audience (36, $6 . 1 \%$ , and interpreted the audience of their written works in different ways. Some deemed their audience as the readers of the magazine in an authentic sense, some were of the opinion that they are writing to the examiners who mark their scripts, and finally, there were also students who thought that both these groups are their audience. This TR may cause some confusion to students and resulted them in constantly changing their writing plans, as stated by the following two participants: I tried to use more examples from the perspectives of the young people. My role is Chairman Cai Yixin (stated in the task prompt), and the audience of my article are mainly young people, so I need to engage them (S5 Int) and  think it will be bettr if I mention the purose of the writing at the beinning and also theend of the esy. need to consider how the rater will think about my esay as well (S13, TA). The above two examples represented the two ends of the spectrum of views held by the students.

Under the theme of fulfilling rhetorical purpose, all idea units coded placed high importance on evaluating the value of source materials in communicating with their readers. Students mentioned that i is important to put forward feasible insights (49, $8 . 4 \%$ and persuasive arguments (8, $1 . 4 \% )$ , as stated by the following two participants: I will cite the information and then give my own opinion on what is the best approach (6, TA) and I wil give an example of people who have cardiopulmonary disease. I think my aguments are closer to real life, using more relistic examples can make the article more convincing (2, TA). However, esidea units regarding making comments on the summarized information were coded (13, $2 . 2 \%$ , illustrating their idea that the main goal of the task is to fulfll the rhetorical urpose of writing, and not to present a comprehensive summary of the reading sources. The added examples were used to convey a stronger argument to their audience.

Under the theme of presenting the argument elements in writte format, students apeared to have almost identical comments on using a standard format template in their writing (63, $1 0 . 8 \% )$ and establishing a clear relation between the stance and evidence (26, $4 . 4 \%$ . However, there appeared to have a significant difference on having a complete ending, with 55 idea units from the think-aloud process and one from interviews. Some students think that the end of the article should be an essence f the fll text, providing a comprehensive summary that appeals to the general public, which can be seen in s19 (Int)I want to sublimate the article in the end, emphasizing the importance of fostering mutual understanding among individuals. This understanding should genuinely inspire the practice of traditional virtues from within ther heart, rather than merely adhering to reulations." In contrast, ther students quoted from the material and repeated their position, but faled to provide a concise summary of the texts intended purpose, as mentioned by S18, I have used the firs source material here, which already highlights the purpose of the priorit seat is to offr convenience to individuals facing mobility challenges. It aready mentioned about upholding the traditional Chinese cultural values of respecting the elderly, showing love to the young, and helping others."

During writing, students consistently paid attention to presenting a key viewpoint in each of the paragraphs. It i clear that their TR is to explitly expresstheir viewpoints at the beginning of each paragraph, and this i rlated to their prior writing experience and writing intruction, as mentioned by the following interviewee, \*Our teacher taught us some format in normal writing class such as stating your viewpoint first and explain why is t so, then provide evidence to support your viewpoints as well as the reasons and write a conclusion at the end. I always use this format' (S17, Int).

The think aloud and interview data unveiled the writing process and shed light on the students' TR. Students oriented themselves more to reconciling the content from the reading materials with their own writing goals as wellas incorporating their own prior knowledge, and fiting into a structured template that they have in mind, while les efort is use to summarize, evaluate, or preent a comprehensive understanding of the given reading materials. They came up with such a TR as they interpreted the task prompt had required them to do so.

# 4.2. Factor structure of TR

After analysing the codes from the seven themes identified in Phase One, a 22-item scale see Appendix A) was generated by the expert group. To response to RQ1, EFA and CFA were conducted separately to explore and validate the structure of TR scale.

# 4.2.1. Descriptive statistics

Descriptie statistics for allitems of the scale are reported in Table 3. The mean of all items on TR ranged from 2.90 to 4.94. According to Kline's (2016) rule of thumb, the items were normally distributed with skewness ranging from $- 1 . 0 0$ to .48 and kurtosis ranging from $- . 6 7$ to 1.82.

# 4.2.2. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)

EFA was performed to explore the structure of the TR scale. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value for the initial EFA was .95, the value close to 1, indicating that factors obtained by EFA were distinct and reliable (Field, 2013). Bartltt's test of sphericity was significant at the .001 level,indicating that common factors existed among variables. Both KMO and Bartlet's test of sphericity suggested that factor analysis could proceed.

For EFA, the principal axis factoring with an oblique rotation (Promax) was applied. The oblique rotation method was chosen because we expect the factors to be correlated with each other. The eigenvalue f allfour factors was greater than 1, and the scree plot also suggested four factors. This means that it can be initially assumed that the TR scale contains four factors.

EFA helps to see how different items (or variables) cluster on factors. The factor loadings showed the degre of relationship between the item and the corresponding factor, and the magnitude of the value indicates how important the item is to the factor. We referred to the factor loadings to remove the inappropriate items. Items were excluded when: a) items with factor loading lower than .4 (Hair et a., 2010); b) items with cros-loadings on different factors higher than .40; c) the factor was loaded by only one item. 5 items (item 9, 10, 11, 8, and 5) were deleted one by one through the re-running of EFA. It is worth noting that items 9, 10, 11 are reverse-scored items that loded onto  single facor. Statisticall, one of the limitations of reverse-scored items is that it i easy to searate from the original theoretical factor and loaded onto an additional fator (Weijters e al., 2013). Theefore, allthese items were deleted and only three factors were retained. The details of these excluded items can be found in Table 4.

Finally,all remaining 17 items were sucessully loaded onto the corresponding theoretical factors. The factor loadings are presented in ab. t can e s that there are 6 itms custered ont the firs factor, which r all about selting, interating and citing information. Therefore, it was defined as source use. The second factor (7 items) comprised a combination of items related to responding writing prompt and fulilling rhetorical purose, ll of which related to items about the pecific components that should e included in integrated writing in a given context, the function of those components, and the relationship between them. We defined this argumentation and task context factor as rhetorical purpose. The third factor (4 items) was text format, and allof the items dealt with the ideal writing format for students.

The internal consistency reliabilities of three factors on TR scale were acceptable, ranging from Cronbach's $\alpha = . 7 7$ to .89. And the ronbach's a coefficient of allitems was .92. Moreover, the correlation between three factors ranged from .70 to .74 (see Table 4).

# 4.2.3. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)

CFA was conducted to validate the factor structure suggested by the EFA. The 3-factor TR scale with 17 items demonstrated accepted model fit with $\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 1 1 6 \right) = 3 4 8 . 7 4$ $\mathrm { C F I } = . 9 4 $ $\mathrm { T L I } = . 9 3$ , RMSEA $= . 0 7$ $\mathbf { S R M R } = . 0 4 .$ Factor loadings of items ranged from .44 to .85 and were satisticly significant at the.001 level (se Fig.1). Both the goodmode fit and the high facor loadings indicated that our observed data match well with the latent structure of the TR scale explored by EFA. That is the CFA results validated the latent structure of the TR scale constructed and explored in this study.

# 4.3. The relationship between TR and IW task performance

The mean (standard deviation) of four dimensions on IW task performance ranged from 5.67 to 6.04 (1.92 - 2.10). The skewness ranged from $- 1 . 3 3$ to 1.50 and kurtosis ranged from .80 to 1.86, which showed that the IW task performance was normally distributed. The measurement validity of the IW task performance was validated first using CFA. The CFA result showed that the model fitted well, withy $^ 2 ( 2 ) = 1 6 . 9 0$ $\mathrm { C F I } = . 9 9$ , TLI = .99, RMSEA $= . 0 7$ , SRMR $= . 0 1$ , and the factor loadings were all greater than .40, which was statistically significant.

To answer RQ2, we examined the corrlation between the three factors of TR scale and IW task performance The results (see Table 6) showed that there was aignificant positive correlation betwenthe thee factor i, source use, rhtorical purpose, andtext format) and IW performance. Text format $( r = . 2 3 )$ had a slightly higher correlation with IW performance than rhetorical purpose and source use $( r = . 2 0$ and .16, respectively).

# 5. Discussion

The present study uniquely merged theories of integrated writing and multiple-text comprehension, analysed students' writing process and products using sequential mixed methods to established a three-factor TR scale with 17 items in total. Good psychometric propertie of the instrument were confirmed, and the three factors were found to be significantly positively correlated with IW per. formance. A few issues worthy of discussion are identified.

This study notably included the concept of epistemic belief and identifid the thre factors of TR using a considerably large sample. Acceptablereliabilit and validity were found. Reliability indices suggested that the TR scale and allthee dimensions posses good interal consistency reliability. All items were also scrutinized by experts and attained acceptable content validty. CFA result up ported that TR scale achieved an acceptable fitness, providing evidence for construct validity. The thre factors were moderately

correlated with the others $( \mathbf { r } = . 7 0 \mathrm { - } . 7 4 )$

The frst factor i source use, paying atention to the use of information acros the various texts, with specific focus on the writers intertextual awareness (Braten et al., 2011). Essentially, we identified the students used justification by multiple sources, which corroborated with Braten et al.s (2013) study, as wellas other research on multiple-text comprehension (Braten et al., 201; Bromme et a., 2010; Wiley et al., 2020). dditionall, previous work mostly studied collee students, whers ours aded to the literatre with secondary school students' data, opening up new venture into younger learners for highly complex reading and writing tass in un. derstanding their epistemic beliefs. Notably, we identified learners who will use both multiple sources and personal justifications concurrently. This may be atributed to the developmentaltrajectory nature (Grene et al., 2008) of epistemic beliefs, which essentially reminded us about employing a developmental perspective in educational setings. Hence, educational research probing into young learners epistemic beliefs may detect alarger overlaying betweenthe different justfications of knowing as compared to adult learners. Nevertheless by unveiling students' epistemic cognition on source use, we may conclude that the provision of the source materials seemed to play a crucial role in shaping students' TR of the written work to produce a sophisticated argumentation either to agree or rebut with the views provided in the source materials (Wiley et al. 2020), and les s seen of merely summarizing the reading materials as found in previous studies (Ruiz-Funes, 2001).

The second factor, rhetorical purpose, represented a cognitive-social aspect of integrated writing task, with the writers communicating a purpose of writing with his audience. As the writing task studied in this research is an argumentative one, the participants illustrated their lines of argument with the support of the source materials, by interacting with the information from the sources, as well as evaluating the importance of the reading sources based on how well they resonate with the writer's prior knowledge (Petric & Harwood, 2013); with the aim of formulating stronger justifications (Glassner et al., 2005).

The third factor is text format, depicting the ideal form of the final written product that the writers aspire to present (Flower, 1990) by iting i the TR of their past writing experiences (Ruiz-Funes, 2001). The participants were taught in schol to analyse organization of reading passges and write well-structured essays since young. Therefore, their TR recorded in this study captured repeated accounts about having to produce an integrated writing that paid great atention to the organizational structures which is in-line with Cheng's (2009) study. Following Basham et al. (1993) assertion that cultural ifferences play a role in TR, we may assume that the cultural uniqueness of the Chinese in confounding to an ideal' text format is taking an efect i our study. Notably, the students are preoccupied with producing a well-structured piece of integrated writing throughout the writing process,not for the sake of communicating with the readers as in a rhetorical purpose, but to fllow a writing template as required in Hong Kong's educational context. Hence, the educational context may be another plausible reason for students TR contains text format as avivid characteristic.

Additionally i is important t acknowledge that students of different proficiency levels exhibit distict tendencies and behaviors in relation to the three factors. Findings derived from think-aloud protocols and interviews indicate that students who excel in reading and writing showcase robust reading comprehension skills adeptly integrate information into their writing, and posses a clear understanding of task requirements. Conversely, students who face challenges with reading and writing encounter difficulties in comprehending the material as a whole, lack a clear purpose in their writing, and struggle to met task requirements whil effectively utilizing the provided sources. Table 7 presents a more comprehensive comparison, including illustrative examples from the interviews.

# 5.2. Relationship between TR and writing performance

It i found that the thre factors,source use, rhetorical purpose and text format were significantly positively correlated with in tegrated writing performance, which indicated the criterion validity of the TR scale and also revealed the relationship betweenTR and integrated writing performance. However, it should be pointed out that the correlation between the three factors and integrated writing peformance is relatively low, while text format and integrated writing performance is sightl higher than rhetorical purpose and source use. The low correlations may be due to the fact that the formulation of TR may not mean that the writers are able to produce a written product that mirrors their TR. As recorded in previous works that during the course of composing an integrated writing task, students are using more time to shape this understanding and their TR may appear to be different hroughout the process (Ruiz-Funes, 2001). Other than that, students may not have the adequate competence or set of strategies required to attain their writing goals as they envisioned in their TR. That i to say, the formation of TR may need to be complimented with a threshold linguistic knowledge (Wolfersberger, 2013), efective tratey use (Gebril & Plakans, 2013), and support in the inerpretation of the task requirements (Allen, 2004). In the case of our study, although the students were exposed to integrated writing task as stipulated in the curriculum, ther i les information with regards to the effctivenes of its implementation. Teachers tended to teach the integrated skill as a way of examination preparation, and les is done to engage with students TR or conduct explicit teaching to .bring un. derstanding on how to approach the task. Further research in this in is required before a more luminous conclusion about its impact on integrated writing performance can be made. The relatively closer relationship between text format and integrated writing performance indicated that the students were influenced by their prior experience of argumentative writing that they model their TR of integrated writing task with it (Ruiz-Funes, 2001). Another plausible reason is that they were influenced by the writing instruction commonly seen in Hong Kong, which focused on abiding to the genres' conventions, which is also evident from the participants interview data when they mentioned that their writing knowledge learnt.

# 6. Limitations, conclusion and implications

Several limitations need to be mentioned. First cross-secional data were collected in this study, and the longitudinal and interventional data is encouraged to be collectd in future studiesto examine the invariance f the impact over time Second, the use f think-aloud verbal requires caution as they can impact on the processes when the writers aes the sources and composing their essay simultaneously. Furthermore, although the participants were trained to verbalize their thoughts as they are performing IW tasks, there were stil gaps of silence where they were thinking without speaking out. To minimize the impact, we conducted fllow-up interviews. Third, reverse-keyed items were excluded from the original TR scale due to the reverse-keyed items' loading below .4 in all factors. Although Crede et al. (2009) suggested that reverse-keyed items might measure adifferent construct, many researchers argued that a combination of positively-keyed and reverse-keyed items may increase the validity of the measure (Kam & Meyer, 2015a, 2015b). Therefore, more advanced statistical methods, such as Factor Mixture Modeling (Kam & Fan, 2020) can be used in future studies to explore the role of reverse-keyed items.

Despite the limitations, this study yields significant contributions that will benefit both theory and practice. The characteristics of TR that comprised of source use, rhetorical purpose and text format is identified and its relationship with the argumentative W task is established. We theorized the characteristics of TR by considering writers' epistemic belief in their justification in the context of an argumentation, and found developmental characteristics of younger learners as transitioning from using personal justification to justification by multiple sources. Future research may consider investigating on this transition in order o support young learners in responding to complex literacy tasks.

In terms of educational implications, it seems crucial that teachers understand the epistemic beliefs of the students in order to support their learning by capitalising on their orientations about source use. Furthermore, as this study demonstrated the distinctivenes between rhetorical purpose and text format, it points to some shortcomings within the teaching and learning of integrated writing in Hong Kong. Teachers tend to leave examination task towards the senior secondary school years and use rilling methods, instead of developing the integrated skills over years. Referring to Hong Kong's curiculum guides, the developmental stages of language skill are stil described in isolation although the ntegratd writing asessment task has een implemented for amost twenty years. In order to support the teachers, research on uncovering the developmental traectory may inform on curriculum to write in. tegrated skill level descriptors, and conduct teacher professional development workshops to improvise pedagogical methods with the teachers. I short, it i of utmost importance to take students task representation into account and suport their leaning of integrated Skills in this regard.
