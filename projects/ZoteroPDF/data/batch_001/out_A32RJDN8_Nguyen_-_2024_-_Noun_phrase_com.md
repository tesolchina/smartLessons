Research has shown that the use of noun phrases is a salient characteristic favored in academic writing (Biber et al., 2011; Biber & Gray, 2011; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014). Although studies have examined the structure of noun phrases, further research is needed to deepen our under standing of noun phrase complexity in order to inform the instructional content of academic writing courses. In response to this need and the call for more empirical evidence for the developmental stages for complexity features proposed by Biber et al. (2011), this study aimed to investigate differences in the use of noun modifiers among second language learners of English at varying proficiency levels. A corpus consisting of 286 essays, written by international students in response to an English integrated writing placement test, was analyzed for grammatical structures of noun phrases. Results indicated that more proficient writers employed significantly more attributive adjectives, prepositional phrases, finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns, and nonfinite relative clauses. These findings support previous research on the relationship be tween writing proficiency and the use of noun modifiers and provide implications for both academic writing instruction and the development of writing assessment criteria.

# 1. Introduction

Advanced second language (L2) writing development entails many components, including syntactic complexity, the use of lowfrequency vocabulary, coherent organization of ideas, and the appropriateness and conciseness of language use. Among these, syntactic or grammatical complexity has attracted considerable attention from L2 writing researchers (Biber et al., 2011; Biber & Gray, 2011; Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003) and is regarded as a reliable indicator of more competent writing (Ortega, 2003). Syntactic complexity measures are frequently employed to evaluate the effects of grammar or writing courses, examine task-related variations in writing, and assess language differences among learners at different proficiency levels (Ortega, 2003).

Recent studies suggest that for writers at higher proficiency levels, grammatical complexity is often indicated by the use of noun phrases (Ansarifar et al., 2018; Biber et al., 2011; Biber & Gray, 2011; Lu, 2011; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014). Particularly noteworthy is Biber et al.’s (2011) hypothesized developmental stages for grammatical complexity features, which propose that learners progress from clausal to phrasal complexity, specifically noun phrase complexity, as they advance to higher proficiency levels. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between noun phrase complexity and L2 writing proficiency (Lan et al., 2019b; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022; Seo & Oh, 2024) or L2 writing quality (e.g., Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Taguchi et al., 2013). These studies have yielded mixed results. Some researchers (e.g., Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Guo et al., 2013; Lan, Liu, & Staples,

2019,b; Yang et al., 2015) have argued that noun phrase complexity might not be a good predictor of writing quality, thus challenging Biber et al.’s hypothesis. Conversely, others (e.g., Casal & Lee, 2019; Kyle & Crossley, 2018) have found evidence supporting Biber et al. that noun phrase complexity has some predictive power for L2 writing competence. Therefore, further research is needed to illuminate the role of noun phrase complexity in L2 writing development and to validate the developmental stages of grammatical complexity proposed by Biber et al. (2011).

Further studies exploring the relationship between noun phrase complexity and writing proficiency are also necessitated by the limitations of previous studies. First, most studies investigating the link between noun phrase complexity and academic writing proficiency of L2 English learners made assumptions about writers’ proficiency levels based on their educational levels rather than formal writing test scores (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014). While this method of classifying writers’ proficiency has certain merits, it does not always guarantee accuracy. A study employing a standardized exam to categorize writers into various proficiency groups would provide a more accurate reflection of the role of noun modifiers in writing proficiency.

Second, although a few studies have investigated an array of noun phrase complexity features in Biber et al.’s (2011) develop mental stages, more studies should be conducted on under-researched features, especially those that cannot be captured by computer programs and thus require human judgment of their meaning (i.e., whether they have abstract or concrete/locative meaning or have an animate or inanimate head noun). Also, very few studies have explored noun phrase complexity in integrated writing tasks, defined as tasks where test takers are required to “produce written compositions that display appropriate and meaningful uses of and orientations to source evidence, both conceptually (in terms of apprehending, synthesizing, and presenting source ideas) and textually (in terms of stylistic conventions for presenting, citing, and acknowledging sources)” (Cumming et al., 2005, p. 34). To shed more light on this line of research, this study aims to elucidate the correlation between the use of noun phrase complexity features described in Biber et al. (2011) and the writing proficiency level of test takers from a standardized English integrated writing test for placement purposes.

# 2. Structural complexity in writing and its common measures

Many researchers in the field of language education and applied linguistics have contended that syntactic complexity, along with other measures such as lexical diversity, word characteristics, and expansion in discourse and sociolinguistic repertoire, are indicators of language development (McNamara et al., 2010; Ortega, 2003). Syntactic complexity, defined as “the range of forms that surface in language production and the degree of sophistication of such forms” (Ortega, 2003, p. 492), has attracted considerable attention from many writing researchers (Biber et al., 2011; Grant; Biber & Gray, 2010; Grant and Ginther, 2000; McNamara et al., 2010; Ortega, 2003; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Taguchi et al., 2013). In fact, syntactic complexity has been recognized as an important construct in second language writing research, since the growth of syntactic repertoires and the ability to use them appropriately is an integral part of learners’ L2 development (Ortega, 2003).

For many decades, researchers have employed different indices to measure syntactic complexity. The measures most commonly employed in the majority of studies on student writing development are based on T-units, defined as “one main clause plus whatever subordinate clauses happen to be attached to or embedded within it” (Hunt, 1965, p. 305), or C-units, defined as “each independent clause with its modifiers” (Loban, 1976, p. 9). As a result, various length- and ratio-based quantitative indices per clause, sentence/utterance, T-unit, or C-units were invented to measure syntactic complexity and its development (e.g., mean length of clause/utterance/T-unit/C-unit, or mean number of clauses in a(n) utterance/T-unit/C-unit). Specifically, mean length of T-unit has been considered the most popular measure of syntactic complexity (e.g., Ortega, 2003). Such measures assume that a writer’s grammatical complexity is reflected through clausal subordination: the more dependent clauses the writing has, the more structurally complex it is. A more detailed discussion of the use of T-units as measures of grammatical complexity can be found in Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998) and Ortega (2003).

However, the practice of using T-units as measures of syntactic complexity has been challenged due to their limitations as noted in many studies (Biber et al., 2011; Kyle & Crossley, 2017; Norris & Ortega, 2009). First, such measures seem to prioritize global complexity and obscure other dimensions of the complexity construct and could potentially lead to misinterpretation of results (Norris & Ortega, 2009). Second, the use of measures related to absolute complexity, such as T-units, may not be relevant to some widely held theoretical perspectives in language acquisition (Kyle & Crossley, 2017). Third, there is evidence that the reliance on clausal subordination, which is more peculiar to spoken language, is insufficient in measuring writers’ grammatical complexity because academic writing is characterized by the use of elaborated noun phrases. In fact, global measures such as mean length of clause are insufficient in characterizing noun phrasal complexity because they fail to capture the specific types of linguistic structures present in the writing (Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022). Instead, a more fine-grained approach, such as the frequency of specific linguistic features in measuring phrasal complexity (e.g., Biber et al., 2011), is effective in discerning subtle discrepancies in specific structures across different lan guage proficiency levels.

# 3. Relationship between noun phrase complexity and writing proficiency

While it is a popular argument that academic writing is more structurally complex than speech, as indicated by longer sentences and t-units and its use of subordinate clauses, studies have shown that academic writing is more complex in different ways from spoken discourse (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2011) and therefore, requires additional indices for measuring grammatical complexity (Biber et al., 2011). In their study, Biber and Gray (2010) proved that academic writing was complex and elaborated in the sense that it compressed ideas into noun phrases modified by other phrasal structures, while the traditional belief that academic writing was more complex than speech at clausal levels was not supported. Specifically, Biber and Gray (2011), studying the grammatical changes in noun phrases used in academic prose, found that academic writing relies heavily on nominal structures, with an extensive reliance on nouns and non-clausal phrases as modifiers. In particular, they found that while the frequencies of clausal noun modifiers (e.g., relative clauses) remained relatively stable, there was a notable increase in the utilization of phrasal noun modifiers (e.g., attributive adjectives, nouns as premodifiers, and prepositional phrases as postmodifiers) to construct noun phrases in academic writing. Based on these findings, the researchers argued that academic writing was more ‘compressed’ than ‘elaborated’ because writers have the opportunity to revise their drafts and often need to meet word limit requirements. In a more recent study, Biber et al. (2011) reached a similar conclusion that complex noun constituents, along with complex phrases, were more precise indicators of academic writing.

Discussing the developmental stages of learners’ grammatical complexity, Biber et al. (2011) proposed that learner language developed from conversational competence to academic writing competence through five stages. According to these researchers, this development starts with finite dependent clauses functioning as constituents in other clauses, then moves to nonfinite dependent clauses and phrases functioning as constituents in other clauses, before reaching the final stage where phrasal dependent structures function as constituents in noun phrases. It can be seen from this developmental framework that the researchers considered complex nonclausal features embedded in noun phrases, rather than clausal subordination, a representation of a considerably higher degree of production complexity.

The relationship between phrasal complexity and writing proficiency has been explored by numerous empirical studies (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Casal & Lee, 2019; Lan, Liu, & Staples, 2019,b; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022; Seo & Oh, 2024; Taguchi et al., 2013). These investigations have produced mixed findings, with some studies (e.g., Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Guo et al., 2013; Lan, Liu, & Staples, 2019,b; Yang et al., 2015) indicating no significant association between phrasal complexity and writing quality. For example, Lan et al. (2019a,b) found that less proficient writers relied heavily on advanced noun modifiers, which differed from Biber et al.’s (2011) findings. Meanwhile, others (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Casal & Lee, 2019; Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Maxwell-Reid & Kartika-Ningsih, 2020; Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022; Seo & Oh, 2024; Taguchi et al., 2013) have found evidence to confirm Biber et al.’s hypothesis that noun phrase complexity has some predictive power for L2 writing competence. For instance, Ansarifar et al. (2018) found that, compared to expert writers, MA students less frequently used four types of noun phrase modifiers (i. e., pre-modifying nouns, -ed participles as postmodifiers, adjective-noun sequences as pre-modifiers, and multiple prepositional phrases as postmodifiers) and PhD students used fewer multiple prepositional phrases as postmodifiers. Similarly, Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) compared the use of noun modifiers between English for Academic Purposes (EAP) students (non-experts) and MA students (experts) and found that attributive adjectives (Stage 2) were a favored structure for the EAP students, while the more proficient MA writers used a greater proportion of nouns as premodifiers and prepositional phrases other than of for abstract meanings (Stages 3 and 4). In a more recent study, Seo and Oh (2024), examining the use of English clause and phrasal features in argumentative essays by Korean learners, found that high-proficiency writers made far more than expected use of prepositional phrases, particularly of-phrases, as postmodifiers. The authors confirmed the developmental sequence hypothesized by Biber et al. (2011) in the context of L2 writing, noting that while finite adverbial clauses (Stage 2) were key features of the low-rated essays, WH relative clauses (Stage 3) and of-phrases as postmodifiers (Stages 3–5) best represented the more complex styles of the mid- and high-rated essays, respectively.

The studies that lent credence to Biber et al.’s (2011) hypothesis have certain limitations that make it challenging to generalize the findings to other contexts. First, these studies had some confounding variables that should be considered during the interpretation of the findings. For example, the study by Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) is limited in that two groups of L2 graduate writers were engaged in different genres of academic writing; the less advanced group worked on argumentative essays, while the more advanced group completed literature reviews and discussions. Furthermore, the participants in both groups were able to receive assistance when revising their work. Second, in most studies, proficiency was not measured externally but was assumed based on student membership in a certain program. For instance, in Parkinson and Musgrave (2014), the MA group served as a proxy for a more proficient group, while the EAP students represented the intermediate group. Due to these limitations, combined with the mixed findings of the studies investigating the relationship between noun phrase complexity and writing proficiency, more research should be conducted to illuminate the role of noun phrase complexity in L2 writing development and to validate the developmental grammatical complexity hypothesis proposed by Biber et al. (2011).

The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which three groups of L2 writers could be distinguished based on their use of the noun modifiers outlined in the framework suggested by Biber et al. (2011). Specifically, this study investigated the complexity of noun phrases in integrated, argumentative essays written at four proficiency levels. The findings from this study could provide evidence supporting the developmental stages of complexity structures for L2 writing (Biber et al., 2011) and offer useful information for the design of academic writing courses and rating scales for academic writing responses.

# 4. Research questions

This study aimed to investigate the use of noun phrases in integrated, argumentative essay responses at four proficiency levels. It specifically sought to address the following research question: How do writers from four proficiency levels (i.e., B, C, D, and P) differ in their use of noun modifiers, and how does this relate to developmental stages of complexity?

# 5. Methods

# 5.1. Corpus

The corpus in this study consisted of 286 argumentative essays (88,166 words) from an integrated English writing test for placement purposes at a large US university. This academic writing test, designed for incoming students who did not speak English as their first language, measured test takers’ ability to use English to synthesize information presented from external sources and to support arguments using information from those external sources as well as their own knowledge. During the test, test takers were asked to read two source texts of approximately 300 words each on the topic of homeschooling. They then responded to two timed tasks: (a) a 100-120-word summary of the two texts $\mathrm { 1 5 } \mathrm { m i n }$ ), and (b) a 300–350-word argumentative essay in response to a question of whether homeschooling should be encouraged $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ). The essays were graded by two graders based on four placement levels – B, C, D, and P, using the grading rubric in Appendix A.

Test takers placed in B, the lowest level in terms of proficiency, were required to take a writing course focused on grammar and sentence-level writing. Those placed in C or D would need to take a more advanced writing course for undergraduate and graduate level, respectively. The P test takers were considered to have successfully passed the exam and were not required to have any additional writing support. Details about each subcorpus are summarized in Table 1.

# 5.2. Analyses

The corpus was analyzed according to the grammatical features specified as noun modifiers by Biber et al. (2011). These features, along with their examples, are listed in Table 2. It should be noted that attributive adjectives included participial adjectives (i.e., hidden costs, life-threatening distractions). Also, finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns as postmodifiers were not included in Biber et al. (2011). Since the head noun modified by the relative clause is non-animate, and thus could be abstract, it is possible that this feature, similar to prepositional phrases with abstract meanings, is acquired in Stage 4.

Linguistic analysis was conducted first, followed by statistical analysis. Details about the analyses are presented below.

Linguistic analyses. The corpus was annotated by the Biber Tagger for an array of linguistic features with both precision and recall over $9 0 \%$ in L1 and L2 writing (see Biber & Gray, 2013 for more detailed description and information on its precision and recall for each feature). However, since the essays were written by nonnative speakers of English, they contained errors that impacted the tagger’s precision and recall. Therefore, a computer program was used to spellcheck the essays before the tagger was used. The annotated corpus was then checked for inaccurate tags, such as instances of that, -ing, -ed (Biber & Gray, 2013). Next, a Python script was developed to extract three features that could be reliably tagged by the Biber Tagger: attributive adjectives, of-prepositional phrases, and nonfinite relative clauses (-ing/-ed clauses) as postmodifiers. As the precision and recall of the tags were greater than $9 0 \%$ , no manual adjustments were made. The remaining noun modifiers required both automatic extractions using Python scripts and manual adjustments or coding.

It should be noted that finite relative clauses in this study included those where the relative pronoun (i.e., that and wh-) was present as well as where it was omitted. Therefore, relative clauses were more comprehensively counted in this study compared to previous research. Prepositional phrases included of-prepositional phrases, which can be extracted using Python code, and those that started with other prepositions, which required manual adjustments. The instances of finite relative clauses and prepositional phrases were also coded by two applied linguists based on the type of head nouns they modified (i.e., animate or non-animate) and the abstractness of their meaning (i.e., concrete/locative or abstract). Krippendorff’s α coefficients for intercoder reliability were reported at 0.98 and 0.87, indicating very high agreement between the two coders (Krippendorff, 2004).

Statistical analyses. First, the rate of occurrences for each grammatical feature was counted for each text, following an obser vational research design in which the total number of texts for each level was the total number of observations for that level. The independent and dependent variables were identified as proficiency level and rates of occurrences for the grammatical features, respectively. After the raw occurrences were tabulated, they were then normed to 300 words to allow for comparison across texts of different lengths. Then, the total number of these features was calculated and compared to detect any significant differences in noun modifier use across the four groups. Since the noun modifier totals were normally distributed, as indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test result, a one-way ANOVA was conducted, followed by pairwise Tukey post-hoc tests. Levene’s test was conducted to ensure that the assumption of homoscedasticity for one-way ANOVA was met.

After that, individual noun phrase complexity features were compared across the four groups. Since the $p$ -values of the ShapiroWilk normality tests for the grammatical structures were lower than 0.05, indicating that the rates of occurrences of the features were not normally distributed for each group, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis $H$ -tests were conducted to detect any differences among the four groups in their use of these noun modifiers. In cases of significant Kruskal-Wallis $H$ -tests, post-hoc Dunn’s $\mathfrak { z }$ -tests was con ducted with Bonferroni adjustment for the threshold of significance (Corder & Foreman, 2009). Additionally, the effect size coefficient $\eta ^ { 2 }$ was computed to identify the magnitude at which the between-level differences in each feature reached statistical significance. An $\eta ^ { 2 } \ge 0 . 1 4$ indicates a large effect size, $0 . 0 6 \leq \eta ^ { 2 } < 0 . 1 4$ a moderate effect size, and $0 . 0 1 \leq \eta ^ { 2 } < 0 . 0 6$ a small effect size (Cohen, 1988). All statistical analyses were conducted in R.

# 6. Results

Descriptive statistics for all noun modifiers, normed by 300 words, used by test takers in the four groups are presented in Table 3. Overall, students used more noun modifiers in their responses as they progressed in their writing proficiency, as reported by the increasing mean of normed frequency of noun modifiers from level B to level P.

A one-way ANOVA indicated that the groups significantly differed in their use of noun modifiers $( F _ { ( 3 , 2 8 2 ) } = 1 4 . 2 9 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , with a moderate effect size $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 3 )$ . Pairwise Tukey post-hoc tests revealed that level B and C test takers employed significantly fewer noun modifiers compared to their level D and P counterparts, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 2 provides an overall picture of the use of the nine noun modifiers, represented by the normed rate of occurrence per 300 words, across the four groups. It can be seen that attributive adjectives were used the most often across all four groups, followed by nouns as premodifiers and prepositional phrases with concrete/locative and abstract meanings. In contrast, nonfinite relative clauses, prepositional phrases with nonfinite complement clauses, and that/to complement noun clauses seemed to be used very rarely. Fig. 2 also shows that as the proficiency levels increased, the normed rate of occurrence gradually increased for the grammatical features, except for finite relative clauses with animate head nouns, nouns as premodifiers, and that/to complement noun clauses.

Results from the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests showed that there were statistically significant differences among the four groups of test takers in their use of attributive adjectives, prepositional phrases with concrete/locative and prepositional phrases with abstract meanings, finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns, and nonfinite relative clauses, with all $p$ -values lower than 0.05. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 3, the four groups were significantly different in their use of attributive adjectives, with $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 3 ) = 2 3 . 4 ( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ and a moderate effect size $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 )$ . The post-hoc Dunn’s $\mathfrak { z }$ -test with Bonferroni adjustment indicated that level B test takers were significantly different from level D and P test takers, with adjusted $p$ -values ${ < } 0 . 0 0 1$ .

Similarly, prepositional phrases with concrete meanings and prepositional phrases with abstract meanings were also employed signifi cantly differently as postmodifiers, with $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 3 ) = 1 2 . 9 \left( p = 0 . 0 0 5 \right)$ and $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 3 ) = 2 0 . 1$ $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , respectively. The effect sizes $\eta ^ { 2 }$ for the two features were reported at 0.04 and 0.06, indicating small and moderate effect sizes, respectively. Results of the pairwise comparison tests with significant $p$ -values are summarized in Fig. 4. The post-hoc Dunn’s test for prepositional phrases with concrete/locative meanings (left) showed that level B test takers were significantly different from level P test takers $( p = 0 . 0 1 )$ ). Meanwhile, the post-hoc Dunn’s test indicated that level P test takers used prepositional phrases with abstract meanings (right) significantly differently from those at levels B and C, with $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ and $p < 0 . 0 1$ , respectively.

Regarding finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns, there was also a significant difference among the four levels, with $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 3 )$ $= 1 8 . 8$ $( \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ ) and a small effect size $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 6 )$ . As illustrated in Fig. 5, which presents the results of the post-doc Dunn’s test, level P test takers were found to employ significantly more finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns than level B and C test takers, with $p < 0 . 0 5$ and $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , respectively.

The last grammatical feature that significantly distinguished the four proficiency levels was nonfinite relative clauses $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 3 ) = 3 2 . 3 , p$ $< 0 . 0 0 1 \dot { }$ ). The effect size of this difference, although moderate $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 )$ , was higher than other effect sizes reported earlier. Results from the post-hoc Dunn’s test (Fig. 6) showed that level B and C test takers used this feature significantly differently from level D and P test takers. Specifically, level B test takers employed this feature significantly less often than level D and P test takers, with $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ and $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ , respectively. Similarly, this feature appeared significantly less frequently in level C test takers’ essays compared to those of level D and P test takers, with $p = 0 . 0 2$ and $p = 0 . 0 0 2$ , respectively.

# 7. Discussion

Overall, level B and C test takers were found to use significantly fewer noun modifiers than those from levels D and P, echoing previous studies on phrasal complexity, which also found a positive correlation between proficiency and the use of noun modifiers in writing (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022; Taguchi et al., 2013). Although specific noun modifiers showing statistical significance may vary across studies, our findings indicate a general trend of increased usage of noun modifiers in L2 writing with higher proficiency levels. Specifically, five noun modifiers that distinguished the proficiency levels were identified: attributive adjectives, prepositional phrases with concrete/locative meanings, prepositional phrases with abstract meanings, finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns, and nonfinite relative clauses.

The fact that writers of higher proficiency levels employed significantly more attributive adjectives (Stage 2) supports previous findings (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Biber & Gray, 2013; Casal & Lee, 2019; Lan et al., 2019b; Taguchi et al., 2013). However, this finding contradicts the results of Parkinson & Musgrave (2014), which found that lower-proficiency students favored this feature more than their more competent counterparts. Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) argued that attributive adjectives, being acquired earlier than other noun modifiers, would be used more by less proficient writers compared to more advanced ones. The lack of support for this argument in the study suggests that frequency of occurrences of a grammatical feature needs to be examined in tandem with that of other features, such as lexical or clausal complexification strategies, to obtain a more complete picture of writing proficiency development.

The steady increase in the use of prepositional phrases as postmodifiers from level B to the highest level, P, aligns with the findings from earlier studies (e.g., Taguchi et al., 2013). As argued in previous research (Biber et al., 2011; Biber & Gray, 2011), prepositional phrases modifying noun phrases are characteristic of academic writing and are more likely to be acquired by higher-proficiency learners. The use of prepositional phrases with concrete/locative meanings (Stage 3) and prepositional phrases with abstract meanings (Stage 4) increased steadily with proficiency, providing empirical support for Biber’s et al. (2011) hypothesis on the development of grammatical complexity. The higher frequency of prepositional phrases with abstract meanings (Stage 4) in level P essays, compared to those in levels B and C, is consistent with prior phrasal complexity studies that identified significant proficiency differences in noun modifier use at higher developmental stages (Ansarifar et al., 2018; Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022). The results also indicated that nonfinite relative clauses, including -ing and -ed particles as postmodifiers, could reliably distinguish proficiency levels, as indicated by the moderate effect size in the Kruskal-Wallis test and the statistically significant post-hoc tests for every proficiency pair, with the exception of B–C. Thus, nonfinite relative clauses exhibited a gradual increase in frequency in higher proficiency levels, a trend that echoes Parkinson & Musgrave (2014) and supports Ansarifar et al. (2018), who found significant differences between the lower proficiency MA group and the expert writers in the use of -ed participles as postmodifiers. Overall, these findings align with the prediction by Biber et al. (2011) that these noun modifiers are acquired or developed at later stages. Consequently, it is anticipated that their usage is significantly influenced by proficiency, with more proficient writers employing noun modifiers from advanced stages more frequently than their less proficient counterparts.

One interesting finding in this study pertains to finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns. It should be noted that this feature is not included in Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental stages. However, the finding that the use of finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns was significantly more prevalent as proficiency levels increased suggests that this is one of the more challenging features that can be acquired or developed later, perhaps in Stage 4, where learners can use the language to discuss more abstract topics.

Although descriptive statistics showed a gradual increase in use as proficiency progressed, no statistically significant difference was detected for four modifiers: finite relative clauses with animate head nouns, nouns as premodifiers, prepositional phrases with nonfinite complement clauses, and that/to noun complement clauses. Since previous research identifying statistically significant differences in relative clause use among writers of varying proficiency levels (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022) did not specify the head noun type (animate or non-animate), it is not possible to compare the findings on finite relative clauses with animate head nouns to the existing literature. The similarly infrequent use of this feature across proficiency levels could be attributed to the abstract topic of homeschooling in the prompt, as the topic plays a significant role in noun modifier use (Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022). The fact that the groups did not differ in their use of nouns as premodifiers contradicts findings by Parkinson and Musgrave (2014), who identified a positive association between proficiency and the use of nouns as premodifiers, and Lan et al. (2019b), who found a negative association between these variables. This difference could be attributed to the different writing tasks used in these studies. Although writing tasks were not described in Parkinson & Musgrave (2014), the task in Lan et al. (2019b)

involved independent writing without external source materials, whereas the writing prompt in this study included external source texts. Since the prompt’s wording can condition writers’ essays (Aull, 2015, 2017; Miller et al., 2016), it is possible that the different prompts triggered varying language use among writers. The finding that prepositional phrases with nonfinite complement clauses and that/to noun complement clauses were least commonly used is consistent with the results reported by Parkinson and Musgrave (2014). This lends support to the framework proposed by Biber et al. (2011) that these features are likely to be acquired in the last stage of

grammatical complexity development.

Below are excerpts from two randomly selected responses, one from a level P (more proficient) writer and one from a level B (least proficient) writer, demonstrating how the five noun modifiers that significantly distinguished the proficiency levels were employed. The two excerpts have similar word counts. Note that attributive adjectives are in italics; prepositional phrases functioning as noun modifiers are bold and underlined; finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns are in bold italics, nonfinite relative clauses are in bold; head nouns with the above-mentioned modifiers are enclosed in [square brackets].

The financial [burden] of homeschooling which has been highlighted by Lisa Miller in her text is one of the [reasons] why I think children should not be homeschooled. I believe parents are better off saving that extra [amount] required for homeschooling for their children’s college funds or using that money to give their children a head [start] in [life] after college or high [school]. It would also be interesting if research can be concluded on how homeschooled [children] face in their adult [life]. This I would like done because my speculation is that those adults who would have been homeschooled might not fare well under day-to-day [pressure] that the modern [world] throws at us. My reasoning is that [those] homeschooled would have missed out on an [induction] on life presented by conventional junior and senior [schools]. Even though it’s mere speculation, I think that [adults] with a homeschooling background might end up suffering from depression or stress-related [conditions]. It is because of this that I am not a [supporter] of homeschooling. (Level P, 171 words)

In the above excerpt, the writer used 11 attributive adjectives, six prepositional phrases with abstract meanings as postmodifiers, three finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns, and three nonfinite relative clauses. These modifiers were also embedded in longer noun phrases, such as “financial [burden] of homeschooling which has been highlighted by Lisa Miller in her text” and “extra [amount] required for homeschooling.” The excerpt below from a less proficient writer, despite having a similar word count, includes fewer noun modifiers.

Nowadays, parents could choose different [ways] to let their children get the perfect [education]. Since there are two million kids learn from the comfort their own home, it is sure that there are some irreplaceable [advantage] in [homeschooling] for kids. For example, parents can hire their favorite [teachers], ask teachers to teach what they want their children to learn. And also, beside the normal [knowledge], parents could choose what [kind] of sports, the music equipment (violin, piano, etc.) for their children to learn. However, I do not think homeschooling is a better [way], even homeschooled [students] score more in SAT. I was a talented math [teacher] in China, basically like “homeschool teacher”. If my student is going to take an important [test], I will shut down all other studying plan, only focus on promoting his or her score. I have 100 ways to promote a student’s score in short [time], like 1 week. But it doesn’t mean my student learn and understand knowledge better than others. It is all about testing skills. (Level B, 172 words)

This excerpt contains 10 attributive adjectives, four prepositional phrases as postmodifiers (two of which have abstract meanings), and no relative clauses of any kind. This demonstrates that less competent writers employed these features significantly less frequently than their more advanced counterparts.

# 8. Conclusion

This study examined how writers at different proficiency levels employed various structures of noun phrases in an integrated writing test. The findings revealed a statistically significant difference in the use of noun modifiers (i.e., attributive adjectives, prepositional phrases with concrete/locative meanings, prepositional phrases with abstract meanings, finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns, and nonfinite relative clauses) among writers at difference proficiency levels. The fact that the more proficient group used more noun modifiers in Biber et al.’s (2011) higher stages than the less proficient writers lends support to that hypothesis about devel opmental grammatical stages.

The findings in this study not only support the developmental stages hypothesized by Biber et al. (2011) but also provide valuable insights for writing instruction and test development. Regarding writing instruction, the results suggest that academic writing courses should emphasize noun phrase structures, particularly prepositional phrases as postmodifiers, finite relative clauses with non-animate head nouns, and nonfinite relative clauses, as these features are characteristics of academic prose (Biber & Gray, 2011). Additionally, since other noun modifying features in the highest stages of the developmental framework, such as that/to noun complement clauses and preposition $^ +$ nonfinite complement clauses, occurred very rarely across proficiency levels, increased instruction on these features might be beneficial to students. If the purpose of academic writing courses is to enhance students’ writing skills for clear and effective communication of complex ideas and to meet higher education writing demands, more instruction and practice on noun phrase structures, including the features in the later stages of the developmental framework, should be provided.

Furthermore, this study carries useful implications for writing test development. The finding that certain noun modifiers can discriminate proficiency levels suggests the need for more fine-grained rating scale descriptors to assess the complexity of L2 writers’ grammar, a key component of writing proficiency (Cumming & Mellow, 1996; Grabe & Kaplan, 1996; Ortega, 2003). Such scales should explicitly outline prominent grammatical structures demonstrated by L2 writers at specific developmental levels, rendering consistency in raters’ judgment of test takers’ performance.

However, future studies should address the limitations of the present study. Firstly, following Biber et al. (2011), this study analyzed cross-sectional data, which only provide a snapshot of participants’ writing proficiency at a single point in time and may not accurately reflect true development, which would necessitate a longitudinal approach. Future longitudinal studies extending beyond a single moment in time will allow detection of developments or changes in noun modifier use per participant across time and offer a more accurate picture of development. Secondly, this study did not examine whether test takers borrowed language verbatim from external sources, which could have impacted the findings. Given that text borrowing might be prevalent in lower-level writers (Plakans & Gebril, 2013), future studies should explore how a given language input affects learner output in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of noun modifier use across proficiency levels. Thirdly, the focus on the topic of homeschooling might limit the generalizability of the findings. Since linguistic features in writers’ responses can be affected by the topic (Sarte & Gnevsheva, 2022), an analysis of a corpus with diverse topics would yield more generalizable results. Additionally, while this study sheds light on the frequency of noun modifying features used by learners at different proficiency levels and provides implications for academic writing instruction, examining of the accuracy of these structures could provide insights into common errors made by students to better inform academic writing courses. Lastly, future studies should explore differences in noun phrase use across disciplines and writing genres, and compare academic writing produced by students to texts composed by professional writers.
