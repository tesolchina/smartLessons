Massive open online courses in China   
Multi-dimensional analysis   
Academic register   
Spoken register

Massive open online courses (MooCs) have widely transformed teaching and learning of higher education worldwide. Based on Biber's (1988) multi-dimensional analysis framework, this study uncovers linguistic features of English-medium MOOC video lectures in China and reveals linguistic variation across different disciplinary areas. The results suggest that the video lecture language in English-medium MOOCs provided by Chinese universities tends to be highly informational, non-narrative, explicitly referential, low in persuasion, abstract, and formally planned. Different from traditional university lectures, the closest registers to the target Mooc video lectures in China include academic prose, official documents, and press reportage. Significant differences also exist across disciplinary areas regarding all six functional linguistic dimensions. Findings of this study may provide insights into how language is used in the emerging spoken register, which may further be taken into consideration by instructional designers and instructors of MooCs. For countries where English is used as a second or additional language, such as China, the results may be of particular interest when designing English-medium MOOC video lectures.

# 1. Introduction

The increasing popularity of massive open online courses (Mo0cs) offers opportunities for obtaining new skill and abilities without the restriction of time and space (Vorobyeva, 2018). Opening to learners worldwide, M00Cs have become one of the most convenient platorms that offer high quality learning resources (Uchidiuno et al., 2018) and interactive learning experiences (Wang et al., 2019). Different from traditional face-to-face courses in higher education, M00cs do not have gate-keeping requirements such as educational background, fes, or previous accreditation, thus sustantiall larger audiences are able to atend worldwide (Alraim) et al., 2015; Guerrero et al., 2021). Boosted by the global pandemic in 2020, 180 mllio learners have enrolled i different MOOC platforms, excluding China. In 2020 alone, 2800 courses were launched on M00C plaforms, covering a variety of degree levels and subjects (Shah, 2020). In China, the popularity and advocacy of M00cs are also evident. By 2020 October, 540 million people have enrolled in more than 34,000 M00Cs provided by thirty some platforms in China (Zou, 2020). Empirical research on M0OCs is needed more than ever to provide insights for the further development of MoOCs and achieve effctive distance teaching and learning.

Currently, some universities have established their own MoOC platforms to ffer online courses such as MIT and Stanford, while other universities (e.g., Harvard, Yale) collaborate with commercial Moo providers (e.g., Coursera, Edx, Futureean, etc.) to offer online courses and microcredentials. Most research regarding MooOcs has been based on these two types of Mooc platforms. Some common foci of investigation in the general field of Education have been motivation, interest,satisfaction, engagement, and general perceptions (Fang et al., 2019). Related to the field of Applied Linguistics, a limited number of studies have explored the language used in Mooc discussion threads and it potential correlation to learning performance and course completion (e.g., Crossley et al., 2015; Moon et al., 2014, pp. 15-20; Rossi & Gnawali, 2014, pp. 654 661; Wen et al., 2014; Wise et al., 2017). Even fewer studies have discussed m00c lecture videos and the intructors' discourse from a linguistic perspective (eg, Atapatu & Falkner, 2018; Das & Das, 2019; Shi et al., 2019, p.11-19). To the best of my knowledge, inguistic features of M00c video lectures have yet to be researched in countries where English isused as an additional language (ie., EAL countries), such as China. With the increasing trend of internationalization of universities worldwide and the foundational status of English as a Lingua Franca, research in English-medium mooc video lectures is f critical importance, especially in EAL countries. A thorough description of language use in this context may shed light on instructional language related issues for Mooc designers and instructors when designing the video lectures.

Hence, in light of the identified gap in the literature and the necessity of researching Mooc instructional language in EAL countries for further enhancing English-medium Mo0c video lectures, the present study aims to describe and analyze the language used in the current English-medium MoOc video lectures in China from multiple disciplinary areas. A corpus-based multidimensional analytical framework is employed to present a comprehensive picture of the linguistic features and variation in the target MOOC video lectures.

# 1.1. The language of university lectures and MOOC video lectures

Lectures play one of the most important roles in shaping university students' academic development. Despite various criticisms regarding the effctiveness and efficiency of lecture n teching and learng, letring remains the principal means fr instruction in higher education (Lee 2009). Studies of universty language have revealed the apparent distinction between spoken and written academic instruction, meaning that informational communication i accomplished through very different inguistic means in speech and writing" (Biber, 2006, p. 22). Moreover, from different perspectives, a large body of scholarship has described and discussed lecture language and its potential impact on comprehension and learning. For instance, Swales (1990), Thompson (1994) Lee (2009), and Cheng (2012) have examined the structural paterns of university lectures; Biber et al. (2004), Camiciottli (2004), Csomay (2006), Biber (2006), Nesi and Basturkmen (2006) and Lee and Subtirelu (2015) have investigated extensive linguistic features and language variation in universty lectures; Neumann (2001), Thompson (2006), and Yakob (2013) have presented the cross-disciplinary variation in university lectures. Flowerdew and Miller (1992), Tauroza (2001), and Eslami and Eslami-Rasek (2007) have examined how the language of university lectures may inluence comprehension and learning. Overal, results from the previous studies on English-medium university lectures in various contexts have shown that universt lectures tend to be delivered under time-constraints (Csomay, 2000), share similar linguistic features with conversations and academic writing (Biber, 2006; Csomay, 2006), and exhibit crossdisciplinary differences in the way language is used when presenting the instructional materials (Csomay, 2007).

On the other hand, as a key component of MoOcs, the instructional language of MoOc video lectures has not been researched thoroughly despite its rapid development worldwide. Atapatt and Falkner (2018) investigated the relationship between discourse features of Mo0c video lectures and student video interaction, revealing that some discourse features, such as concrete words frequent content words, and fewer number of sentences in a video, may lead to interaction peaks. Other studies focused on MOOC video lectures analyzed non-verbal intructional features (Sharma et al., 2016), quality aspects of the videos (Shi et a., 2019, pp. 11-19), video designing issues (Wang et al., 2020), and related non-linguistic features. Evidently, as distance education and MOOCs have become more widely spread and accepted, especially due to the influence of the global pandemic in 2020, video lectures have gained increasing atention from researchers in different fields. Nevertheles, a comprehensive description of the newly emerging academic spoken register is missing. The linguistc features of Mooc video lectures, particularly in comparison to traditional university lectures, stll remain unclear. This gap particularly applies to English-mediumMoo video lectures presented by speakers who use English as an additional language.

# 1.2. Disciplinary variation in academic discourse

Different academic disciplines construct disciplinary culture and knowledge through distinct discoursal conventions, such as the writer's expression of stance and engagement and the argument structure (Hyland & Bondi, 2006). With respect to disciplinary features of academic discourse, the written discourse has been particularly well researched. Examples of previously studied written academic discourse revealing cross-disciplinary variation are rearch article ., asturkmen, 2012; Ca0 & Hu, 2014; Hyland, 199, Stotesbury, 2006), textbooks (e., Jalilifr et al., 2017; Moore, 2002; Parodi, 2014), student and/or L2 writig (eg., Crossley et al.,

2017; Gardner et al., 2019; Hardy & Romer, 2013; Hyland, 2004; Yoon & Romer, 2020), doctoral and master's theses (e.g., Hyland, 2008; Paltridge, 2002; Samraj & Monk, 2008; Xia0 & Sun, 2020), online written scholarly communications (e.g., Holmberg & Thel. wall, 2014; Zou & Hyland, 2020), just to name a few. In short, disciplin-specific rhetorical prefernces in written academic discourse have been well established in the literature. In contrast to written discourse, more attention is needed for investigating spoken academic discourse and its disciplinary variation (Hyland, 2006). Csomay (2005) made associations between language change (., variation in inguistic features) and discourse organization within lectures, depicting differences in the discourse structure of the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences. Similarly, within disciplinary areas (e.g., Engineering), Csomay and Wu (2020) have also found differences in language use and discourse paterns regarding university lectures acros dverse geographical regions. Biber (2006) described the language used in the university context, including disciplinary differences in language use in lectures. Camiciotoli (2007) also examined universt lectures in the field of Business Studies. Findings of the study revealed key linguistic features that the instructors employed to achieve interactive purposes, facilitate learning, and the distinctive devices reflecting disciplinary orientations of the community of practice. Furthermore, Hu and Duan's (2019) study on questioning and responding in English-medium instruction classroom settings also uncovered the cross-disciplinary difference regarding student responses between soft and hard disciplines.

Studies revealing disciplinary variation regarding academic discourse applied two major analytical frameworks. On the one hand. one or a few linguistic properties from a micro-level perspective were investigated. Some representatively researched linguistic fea tures are lexical bundles, lexical complexity features, cohesion, and discourse markers. On the other hand, a limited number of studies have employed a comprehensive framework, mainly multi-dimensional analytical framework, combining both macro- and micro-level analysis to investigate language variation acrossacademic disciplines and describe precise language choices in particular contexts (e. g., Biber, 2006; Csomay, 2005; Hardy & Romer, 2013).

However, compared to other academic registers (written or spoken), the linguistic features of Mo0c video lectures remain under. investigated, espill from  cos-discilinary prspective. Whether this nw reistr reflets cross-discilinary variation rmains an open question, as does the der towhich this new rester may diffe from other academic spoken discourses. Therefore, the present study aims to further enrich the literature in academic spoken register regarding ingustic features and explore the potential disci. plinary variation in English-medium MOOc video lectures delivered by EAL speakers. In order to provide a comprehensive description of the linguisic features, the multi-dimensional analytical approach was employed to include a large number of lingustic properties and uncover the linguistic variation thoroughly.

# 1.3. Situational characteristics of English-medium MOOC video lectures in China

As in most Moocs, learners in Chinese Moocs receive direct verbal instructio from the video lectures. Within each learning unit there are usually multiple pre-recorded video lectures which normally last between five to $2 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . The contents of the video lectures are usually ccompanied by illstrative slides and additional reding materials. Mooc video lecture require instructors to deliver the teaching content in an efficient way to fit ithin th time limits. In addition, for most o vide lectures, the instructors donot hae the opportunity to receive feedack from the learners in any form whilerecording (Doherty et al., 2015). Moreover, M00 lecturers understanding of the potential learners of the courses may merely be from their previous teaching experiences, whereas the actual learners' backgrounds may vary considerably and may stay unclear to the lecturers. For some Mo0cs that are open for enrollment to the public without time constraints, the locations and learning times of the learners may difer greatly. Last but not least, thesetting of learning is unique for Mooc video lectures. The addressors and addressee i., instructors and learners)do not share the same physical environment. While watching the video lectures, the learners can access the learning materials either from the MOOC platforms or from their physical environment. Hence, although the Mooc video lectures are in spoken mode and created to verbally present the main learning points, these unique characteristics regarding participants, relations among participants, channel, processing circumstances, and setting may contribute to the distinction in register between Mooc video lectures and traditional uni. versity lectures (Biber & Conrad, 2019).

The purpose of creating English-medium Moocs in China includes increasing Chinese learners' academic English proficiency and promoting the internationalization of the host universties to atract more international learners (Zheng et al., 2018). From obser vational evidence, a vast majority of the instructors are Chinese L1 speakers who use English as a second or additional language. n addition, most video formats consist of one instructor presenting a monologue. In contrast bi-directional talk between two or more speakers remains scarce. Throughout a whole course, multiple instructors are usually involved and each one teaches for one or a few weeks. Unlike some MooC vide ectures no in-video quizzes or pop-questions are observed in Chinese Mo0cs. Therefore, besides the common characterisics of Mo0C video lecturers, English-medium MoOCs in China may also present uniquenessin linguisti variatin due to the instructors' language background and presentation format.

In 2020, to cope with the global pandemic and minimize it isruptive influence on higher education, the Ministry of Education in

China oranized 2 onine plaforms t offer more than 24,00 courses across 12 disciplines and 18 majors for fre to students n higher educational institutions in China (Ministry of Education of People's Republicof China, 2020). In addition, the ministry continues to promote the development of high-quality English-medium Mo0Cs to ofer to the international audience and contribute to worldwide distance education. A series of English-medium national top-level Moocs have been constructed and offered on mainstream platforms such as Chinese University M00C and Chinese University Foreign Languages M00c Platform (Wu, 2020). The mainstream MOOC platorms are usually constructed via the collaboration between commercial educational companies and the Ministr f Education of China as wellas universities around the nation. Guided by the national policy, universties across the country have started building more English-medium MoOcs to enhance their internationalization in distance education. Therefore, the emerging register of English-medium Mo0c video lectures in China is expected to grow more rapidly, and a comprehensive description of its linguistic features and variation may provide insights for further designing and creating Mooc video lectures. This study attempts to achieve this objective to describe the linguistic features of English-medium Mooc video lectures in China from a cross-disciplinary perspective.

# 1.4. Multi-dimensional analysis

Pioneered by Biber (1988), a Multi-Dimensional (MD) analysis is a multivariate analytical technique that describes the patterns of variation in different risters in English (Sardha & Pinto, 2019). The foundational assumption of MD analysis i that \*differences in registers include patterns of co-occurring lexico-grammatical features (Halliday, 1988, p. 162). The common application of MD analysis includes 1) the multivariate statistic procedure of factor analysis which realizes the identification of various sets of co-occurring features and 2) a further qualitative analysis interpreting the underlying functional dimensions of the linguisti fatures that co-occur with a high frequency in a text (Hardy & Romer, 2013). Hence, the framework of MD analysis offers both macro- and microscopic as well as "ground-level' perspectives in describing language in use (Sardinha & Pinto, 2014).

Through MD analysis, findings of numerous empirical studies have shown that language use varies considerably across ifferent contexts and that the patterns of variation are highly consistent rather than unpredictable (Sardinha & Pinto, 2014). From early MD studies that examined the variation between spoken and written registers in English (e.g., Biber, 1986, 1988, 1995), this analytical approach has also been used to investigate language variation in other languages, such as Nukulaelae Tuvaluan (Besnier, 1988), Korean (Kim & Biber, 1994), Somali (Biber & Hared, 1992), Taiwanese (Jang, 1998), Brazilian Portuguese (Sardiha et l., 2014), and Spanish (Asencion-Delaney, 2014). Moreover, studies have researched specialized discourse domains of English via MD analysis, such as academic writing discourse (Hardy & Romer, 2013), callcenter discourse (Friginal, 2008), conversational registers (Biber, 2007) movies (Pinto, 2014), TV series (Quaglio, 2009), pop songs (Bertoli-Dutra, 2014), regional dialects (Grieve, 2014), online news comments (Ehret & Taboada, 2019), and corporate annual reports (Ren & Lu, 2021). While some of these studies followed the 1988 model of variation to reearch the specialized discourse domains, there are also a number of studies that established new MD models to describe the target discourse domain most appropriately.

Although Biber's 1988 framework of MD analysis was not specifically built for academic registers, subsequent studies that researched academic written and spoken discourse have widely adopted or modified this framework to describe the linguistic characteristics of academic registers. For instance, Biber et al. (2002) applied the five main dimensions from the 1988 model to uncover a comprehensive linguistic description of the written and spoken academic discourse at U.S. universities, with resuls pointing to considerable linguistc variation across universty registers. Csomay (2000) particularl described linguistic characteristics of academic lectures based on a slightly modified version of Biber's 1988 model. In addition, Csomay (2006)'s investigation regarding university classoom talk was also based on Biber's 1988 framework to position university classoom talk on the language continuum of speech and writig. Csomay's (2000) and Csomay's (2006) results revealed that academic lectures and university classroom talk both exhibited linguistic features associated with converation and academic prose. Taken together, Biber's (1988) multidimensional framework has proven to be powerful in describing academic registers and the established dimensions have been considered as the standard reference points for examining various writen or spoken registers. Furthermore, due to the exploratory and descriptive features of the current study, employing Biber's 198 framework may provide a comprehensive foundation to describe the new spoken academic register (i., Mooc video lectures) and place it in relation to the other relevant registers examined in previous studies.

Hence, I decided to base the study on the existing 1988 model to describe the inguistic features of the target M00c lectures. To provide a full picture of the linguistic features, this study incudes the six major dimensions and discusses inguistic variation in each dimension in detal. The six major dimensions include: 1) involved vs informational discourse, 2) narrative vs. non-narrative concerns, 3) explicit v. situation-dependent reference, 4) overt expresson of persuasion, 5) abstract vs. non-astract information, and 6) on-line informational elaboration.

# 1.5. The current study

The study aims to investigate the linguistic characteristics of English-medium Mooc video lectures? provided by Chinese universities. To preent a full description of the linguistic featres and variation of the corpus, crossisciplinary analysis was conducted. The following two research questions guided the investigation of the current study:

1. Based on Biber's (1988) MD framework, what are the linguistic features of English-medium M00c video lectures in Chin. regarding each dimension? 2. Are there significant differences across disciplinary areas regarding the linguistic features in the target Mooc video lectures?

# 2. Methods

# 2.1. Corpus

The corpus used in the analysis consists of English mooc video lectures from two platforms based in China, Chinese University M0OC (cUM, https://www.icourse163.org/) and Chinese Universty Foreign Languages M00c Platform (UMo0Cs, htps://umoocs. unipus.cn/). These two platforms are the mainstream platforms in China where top-level universities host their MoOcs. On CUM, the majority of the MOOCs are Chinese-medium; therefore, the researcher exhaustively searched al of the English-medium MOOs on this platorm. On Umoocs, although most of the courses were instructed in English, the main disciplinary areas are only Arts and Hu. manities and Social Sciences. To control the manual workload involved in bulding the video lecture corpus, only video lectures with available embedded subtitles were selected from the two platforms. The embedded subtitles were in English and all intructors first language was Chinese. Although there are a number of English-medium moocs available on these two platforms, those without subtitles were excluded from the corpus, and some courses were not available for enrollment and the content was not visible a the time of data collction. Considering the balance across the disciplinary areas, twelve undergraduate lel Moocs were eventually elected to represent four disciplinary areas, comprising Arts & Humanities, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Allselected MOOCs were designed for introductory level learners in specific fields.

After selecting the Mo0cs, the original subtitles of the instruction in each video lecture of the twelve courses were extracted to construct the corpus. Punctuations were manually aded to some of the video lectures. The vast majorit of the videos lasted between five to $2 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and the tokens of each video lecture varied from 91 to 3766 words. To ensure the accuracy and representativenes of the multi-dimensional analysis, video lectures that had fewer than 200 words were excluded from the corpus.

Table 1 presents detailed information of the corpus. Although the size of each disciplinary area varies, the statistical analysis procedure i., robust ANOVA, introduced in the next section) is believed to be robust for unequal group sizes. In total, 549 video lectures were included in the corpus and the total running words are 550,726.

Note. \* The focus of this course is introductory level knowledge in Business, not the English language.

# 2.2. Analysis

Nini's (2019) Multidimensional Analysis Tagger (MAT) was employed to conduct the multi-dimensional analysis. The tagging mechanism of MAT replicates Biber's (1988) tagging system. After grammaticall tgging the input texts, the program generates dimension scores, normalized annotation statistics, and z-scores of each linguistic feature in the texs; it further plots the input texts on Bibers (1988 six functional dimensions and determines the closest text type of the analyzed texts. Because this study is an "additive multi-dimensional analysis" (Sardinha et al., 2019, p. 165) that aims to incorporate a new register into the existing framework of Biber (1988), only normalized dimension scores of each text were taken to obtain the mean scores and conduct further comparisons. Via MAT, the dimension scores are calculated by summing and subtracting the z-scores of the dimension features that are higher than $1 ^ { 4 }$ depending on whether the features represent positive or negative polar in the dimension (Nini, 2019). Although the MAT program is based on the Stanford Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), Nini (2019) replaces basic Stanford Taggers with more specifictags and expands the Stanford Tager tag set by identifying the linguistic fatures used in Biber (1988 to replicate the original tagging system. In addition, rliability test f the program show that M i largely successu i rlicating Bier's (1988) analysis (Nini, 2019). ence, using MAT to analyze the target lecture texts provides a solid foundation for further investigation.

After completing the analysi of the lectures using MAT and receiving individual dimension scores, a series of robust ANOVA tests were conducted via Walrus in Jamovi 1.8.1 (The Jamovi Project 2021) to examine variance cross-disciplinarily. The package Walrus in Jamovi is based on the WRs2 package whose robust models and tes are les afected by the violation of certain distribution assumptions (Mair & Wilcox, 2020). Corresponding post hoc tests which use the mcp2atm0 function of the WRS2 package were also carried out to reveal specific variations (Mair & wilcox, 2020).

# 3. Results

To answer the two reearch questions described earlier, in this section  report the findings regarding the overallinguistc features f each dimension. Under each imension, I also addressvariations across the four discilinary aras. Scific examples from the video lectures are presented to illstrate the target characterisics. The Appendix shows the summary of allkey linguistic features in each dimension.

# 3.1. Dimension 1: Involved vs. informational discourse

The mean of the first dimension was $- 7 . 5 2$ , indicating that the texts tended to locate toward the negative, namely the informational direction of the continuum. This reveals the high informational density of the lectures in general; in addition, based on this score, academic prose or press reportage can be designated as the closest registers to the target Mo0c lectures (Biber, 198).

Taking aclose look at the individual disciplinary areas allfour diciplinary areas had negative mean scores in Dimension 1 (MArts & Humanities $= - 7 . 1 8$ $\mathsf { M } _ { \mathrm { L i f e \ s c i e n c e s } } = - 1 1 . 0 0$ Mphysical sciences $= - 3 . 3 0$ $\mathrm { M } _ { \mathrm { S o c i a l \ s c i e n c e s } } = - 8 . 4 5$ . Next, to examine whether the differences across the disciplinary areas were statisticall signficant or not,a robust NoOVA test was conducted. The result suggested that there was a statistically significant difference across the disciplinary areas $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ , meaning the target Mooc lectures in different disciplinary areas varied significanly wth respect to informational density. In particula, according to the post hoc test, lectures in the field of Life Sciences had the lowest D1 score and differed significantly from all other three disciplinary areas (all $p < . 0 5 )$ ; whereas lectures in Physical Sciences had the highest mean score which was also significantly diferent from other mean scores (all $p < . 0 5 )$ . The means of video lectures in Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences were similar ig. 1 depicts the mean scores of the four disciplinary areas in Dimension 1.

Fig. 1. Mean scores in Dimension 1 (Involved vs. informational discourse).

Toward the negative end of the continum for Dimension 1, texts usuall present high frequencies of nouns, long words, adjecties, prepositions, and high type/oken ratio (Biber, 198), and the information densit leel is expected to be high. I this case although all four disciplinary areas had negative means in D1, video lectures in Life Sciences may present more features related to informational discourse. The following example is extracted from a lecture of Pathophysiology that had the lowest score in Dimension 1 (D1 Score $=$ -25.62). In this example, long words (e.g., renin-angiotnsin-aldosterone), nouns (e.g., angiotensin, consumption), and adjectives (e.g, peripheral, myocardil) are quite evident. Moreover, the type/token ratio is 0.8, which isconsidered high. (Nouns are underlined, adjectives are in bold.)

Ex. 1. Angiotensin II also maintains arterial blood pressure by constricting peripheral blood vesels. But the persistent activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system also has adverse efects. Angiotensin II increases preload and afterload which increases myocardial oxygen consumption.

# 3.2. Dimension 2: Narrative vs. non-narrative concerns

For Dimension 2, the overall mean score was $- 4 . 5 9$ . The four individual disciplinary areas also displayed negative scores (MArts & Humanities $= - 2 . 4 6$ $\mathbf { M } _ { \mathrm { L i f e } }$ sciences $= - 4 . 8 4$ ; Mphysical sciences $= - 5 . 1 2$ ; Msocial sciences $= - 4 . 4 6 )$ . Low scores along the negative pole in D2 mark non-narrative concerns, such as expository and descriptive discourse; and features that demonstrate considerable negative weight can be present tense and atributie adjectives (Biber, 1988). Thus, the target vide lectures revealed the overall tendency of non-narrative characteristics. Close registers of such can be broadcast, academic prose, and official documents.

Further investigation regarding the variation of the linguistic features in Dimension 2 across the four disciplinary areas was conducted through the robust NovA test. The result showed that the differences acrossthe disciplines were statisticall significant $( p$ $< . 0 0 1 \dot$ .Fig. 2 llustrates the mean scores of the four disciplinary areas. Post hoc test revealed that lectures in Physical Sciences had the lowest and those in Arts and Humanities had the highest D2 score, and D2 scores from these two disciplines differed significantl from the others $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ . The difference between lectures in Life Sciences and Social Sciences was not significant $\left( p = . 0 6 \right)$ . The following example from Industrial Ecology had the lowest D2 score, which llustrates the non-narrative linguistc features f the video lectures (D2 Score $= - 7 . 3 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ . In this example, only present and future tenses were used (e.g., will analyze, includes) and attributive adjectives frequently occurred g., thoreticl, envonmental). Thee features reflect a more frequent use f elaborated nomil reerents, which is commonly observed in non-narrative types of discourse. (Present and future tense verbs are underlined, attributive adjectives are in bold.)

E.x. 2. So, for the whole courses, we will analyze from the question level to theoretical level. And then the application mainly includes 13 chapters. From these courses, we will identify the main environmental concerns for the global level, regional level and so on. And then we wil build the relationship between the humanity and the environment to settle the management target.

# 3.3. Dimension 3: Explicit vs. situation-dependent reference

The overall mean score of D3 was 6.01 and all four disciplinary areas presented positive D3 mean scores $( \mathrm { M _ { A r t s \ \& \ H u m a n i t i e s } } = 4 . 8 8 $ $\mathsf { M } _ { \mathrm { L i f e \ s c i e n c e s } } = 5 . 8 6$ ; Mphysical sciences $= 4 . 5 2$ $\mathbf { M } _ { \mathrm { S o c i a l \ s c i e n c e s } } = 9 . 0 3 )$ , which indicates the discourse as explicit and context-independent. Features that have positive weights include WH-relative clauses, pied piping constructions, phrasal cordination, and nominalizations. The co-occurrence of these features indicates the explicit and elaborated identification of referents in a text (Biber, 1988). Since referentially explicit discourse is usually integrated and informational language use, this aligns with the previous analysis of Dimension 1. The closest registers identified i Biber (1988) regarding Dimension 3 can be oficial documents and academic prose.

Next, the result from the robust AnovA test showed that there were significant dierences across the four disciplinary areas regarding D3 scores $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ . Further post hoc test revealed that lectures in Social Sciences had the highest D3 score, which was significantly higher than the other three disciplines (all $p < . 0 1 \AA$ , suggesting that the lectures in Social Science may present the most explicit and context-independent reference. Video lectures in Life Sciences presented the second highest D3 mean score. As more explicit inguistic feres usually cont th intead and inforational txt, this reult i in line wth the indings in Dmension 1 where video lectures in Life Sciences and Social Sciences demonstrated higher levels of informational features than the other two disciplines. Fig. 3 illustrates the mean scores of the four disciplinary areas in Dimension 3.

To illustrate the context-independent features of the video lecture, thefllowing example is extracted from a lecture that had the highest D3 score in the course of Business English (D3 Score $= 1 8 . 6 4 $ . In this example, nominalizations appeared frequently (e.g., organization, product), in addition to a pied piping construction (i.., in which), a WH-relative clause (i.e., which), and a phrasal co ordination (i.e, or). The co-occurrence f these features contributed to the high D3 score. (ominalizations are double underlined, the pied piping construction is in bold, the WH-relative clause is in bracket, the phrasal coordinator is underlined.)

# 3.4. Dimension 4: Overt expression of persuasion

High scores toward the positive side in Dimension 4 suggest the high degree to which persuasion is marked overtly. This can indicate that the texts explicitly reveal the authors or speakers point of view and their evaluation of likelihood or certainty (Biber, 1988). The average score of the Chinese MO0C lectures in Dimension 4 was $- 0 . 5 6$ , showing a weak tendency of overt persuasion. With this low core, th low frequeny f intives, predction modals susive verbs, esst modals, possbility modals, and son should be expected. The four individual disciplinary areas also showed low D4 scores $( \mathbf { M } _ { \mathrm { A r t s \ \& \ H u m a n i t i e s } } = 0 . 7 9$ $\mathrm { M _ { L i f e \ s c i e n c e s } } = - 2 . 1 4$ Mphysical $_ { \mathrm { c i e n c e s } } = - 0 . 1 7$ $\mathbf { M } _ { \mathrm { S o c i a l ~ s c i e n c e s } } = 0 . 4 5 )$ . The closest register sharing a similar degree of persuasion appears to be academic prose.

The robust AnOvA test showed that the differences across the four disciplinary areas were significant $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ . The average D4 score of lectures in Life Sciences was significantly lower than the other disciplines (all $p < . 0 0 1 $ and the D4 score of Physical Sciences also marked on the negative part. This suggests that lectures i Life Sciences and Physical Sciences characterized the least liklihood in persuasion or expression of personal opinions. This is inaccordance with the demonstration of the previous three dimensions. Namely, lectures in Life Sciences and Physical Sciences tended to adhere to the expository and informational discourse rather than involved or subjective discourse. Although video lctures in Arts and Humanitie and Social Sciences showed positive D4 scores, the scores were still relatively low, and the general tendency of the video lectures did not mark persuasion. Fig. 4 depict the mean scores of th four disciplinary areas regarding Dimension 4.

The following example was extracted from a lecture in Systemic Pathology which had the lowest D4 score (D4 Score $= - 7 . 8 3 )$ . In this example, there were no modal verbs (e., cn, might, should) and no infintives used as adjetive complements (e.g., happy to do it, pleased to eeit). No suasive verbs like command and demand can be found as well. The example reflects highly informational discourse with expository features that do not reveal a personal point of view.

The lesions are found commonly on the valves of the left heart, most frequently on the mitral valves, followed in descending frequency, by the aortic, simultaneous involvement of both mitral and aortic valves, and quiterarely on the valves of the right heart. The vegetations in subacute endocarditis are more often seen on previously diseased valves, whereas the vegetations of acute endocarditis are often found on previously normal valves.

# 3.5. Dimension 5: Abstract vs. non-abstract information

High positive scores in Dimension 5 indicate technical, abstract, and formal discourse. Conjuncts, agentless passives, past participial clauses, by passves, past participial WHIZ deletion relatives, and other adverbial subordinators are key features contributing to high positive scores in Dimension 5 (Biber, 1988). The average D5 score of the Chinese M00c lectures was 1.97, and the four indi vidual disciplines all showed positive D5 scores (MArts & Humanitie $= 1 . 3 5$ $\mathrm { M _ { L i f e \ s c i e n c e s } } = 2 . 6 0 $ Mphysical sciences $= 1 . 1 8$ ; MSocial sciences $=$ 2.43). The closest registers could be pres reportage. Thus, in terms of Dimension 5, the target lectures can be understood as an informational discourse that is abstract formal, and technical. This gneric characteristic i in line with the analysis and interpretation of the four previous dimensions. Despite the disciplinary variation, the target video lectures mainly reflected non-narrtive, explicit reference, expositional, and informational discourse that involved rare interaction and the speakers' personal points of view.

The robust AnOvA test also showed significant differences across the four disciplinary areas regarding Dimension 5 $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ Lectures in Social ciences and Life Sciences had the highest D5 scores on average, and they were ignificantly higher than the scores of the other two disciplines, namely Physical Sciences and Arts and Humanities (all $p < . 0 1 \AA$ . As concluded from the analyses regarding Dimensions 1 and 4, video lectures i Life Sciences showed the highest tendency of having informational and expository features. Now, with the highest D5 score, the result further confirms the high technical content and formal style of video lectures in Life Sciences. Fig. 5 presents the mean D5 scores of the four disciplinary areas.

The following example is extracted from one lecture in Pathophysiology which had a high D5 score $( \mathrm { D } 5 = 1 0 . 4 8 )$ . In this example, passive constructions (eg., was blocked, was released and adverbial subordinators (eg., before, after) frequently occurred, which were commonly used to emphasize astract conceptual information over more concrete or active content. (Passive constructions are in bold, adverbial subordinators are underlined.)

E.x. 5. As seen from the coronary angiography photos, before the PTCA the patient's coronary artery branch was completely blocked and the blockage was released and the myocardium recovered blood perfusion after baloon inflation and stent implantation. The entire surgical procedure was smooth. However, one hour after PTCA, the patient developed palpitation, shortness of breath and dizziness Electrocardiographic monitoring showed ventricular tachycardia and also her myocardial enzyme indicators were further increased.

Fig. 6. Mean scores in Dimension 6 (On-line informational elaboration).

# 3.6. Dimension 6: On-line informational elaboration

Dimension 6 distinguishes discourse that is informational but roduced under real-time conditions from other types of discourse. A high core on this dimension is usually achieved with that clauses as ver complement, demonstratives, that relative clauses on object position, and that clauses s adjective complements. Phrasal coordination is the feature that marks negative weight onthis dimension, which indicates formal and planned types of discourse produced not under strict time constraints (Biber, 198). The average D6 core of the lectures was 0.11 and the D6 scores of the four disciplines were relatively low as well (MArts & Humanitie $= - 0 . 6 3$ ; MLife sciences $=$ 0.37; Mphysical sciences $= 0 . 6 4$ : MSocial sciences $= - 0 . 4 6 )$ , suggesting packed information with high-content words and phrases in fewer constructions in the discourse. This iffers from the features of on-line informational elaboration. The closest register was observed as academic prose. This result further confirms the informational and expository features f the Mooc lectures and corresponds to the unique teaching and learning setting of the Mo0cs, namely that instructors and the learners do not share the same physical environment at the same time.

The robust AnOVA test showed that significant diferences were found acrosthe four disciplinary areas regarding Dimension 6 $( p$ $< . 0 0 1 \dot$ . Although all four disciplinary areas displayed few features related to on-line informational elaboration, the post hoc result showed that lectures in Physical Sciences and Life Sciences had relatively higher D6 scores and the D6 score of lectures in Physical Sciences was significantly higher than those in Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences (both $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ . This result indicates that some video lectures in Physical Sciences and Life Sciences may be presented under more stict real-time conditions. This might be understood from the use of realia and experiments in those video lectures. However, despite the positive D6 scores in Physical Sciences and Life Sciences, the values were tillow and the general discourse should be considered as planned and formal. ig. 6presents the mean D6 scores across the four disciplinary areas.

To illustrate the formal and planned features f the language, the following example is extracted from a lecture in Public Speaking which had a low D6 score $( \mathrm { D } 6 = - 2 . 4 5 )$ . In this example, phrasal coordination can be seen on multiple occasions (e.g., and), which is commonly used as a device for idea unit expansion and informational integration. This is more often observed in planned types of discourse. n addition, that clauses and demonstratives, which contribute to informational elaboration produced under strict real-time constraints, were not found in this excerpt. (Phrasal coordinators are in bold.)

E.x. 6. Generally peaking, volume, rate, pitch, pauses, vocal variety, pronunciation, and articulation are the seven aspects we need to control in a speech. Even in our daily conversation, our voice i a powerful tool to help us expres our emotions and intentions effectively to the listeners. Now try to detect how Wallace uses his voice in the episode from the movie Brave Heart. Have you got any idea to Wallce's use of voice? In the video, there is an obvious change in the volume which refers to the loudness and softness of a speaker's voice.

# 4. Discussion and conclusion

This analysis of English-medium M00C video lectures in China, which was based on Biber's (1988) six functional dimensions revealed that the general trend of the language tended to be highly informational, non-narrative, explicitly referential, low in persuasion, astract, and formally planned. Overall the closest registers to the lectres are written registers like academic prose and official documents and spoken registers like press reportage and broadast. The analysi also revealed some differences and similarities compared to findings in the previous studies that investigated language used in university settings. For instance, based on Biber's (1988) dimensions, regarding Dimension 1, Biber (2002) revealed features of face-to-face interaction rather than informational production in universty classroom teaching. However, the informational characteristics of the target Mooc video lectures identified in this study indicate more similaritie to academic wrtten registers, such as textbooks and course management materials In addition, linguistic features identified in the Chinese mooc video lectures also suggest opposit characteristics from the findings in classroom teaching in Biber (2002) regarding Dimension 3 and 4. The target M00C video lectures displayed more features associated with context-independent references and a low tendency in persuasion, whereas such features were more salient in academic written registers rather than classoom teaching in Biber (2002). Another difference isthat Biber (2002) concluded that the spoken rgisters including classroom teaching, tended to be marked by the absence of passive constructions. Nevertheles, the result of this study showed that passive constructions frequentl ocurred in the target Mo0c video lectures as described in Dimension 5, which are especiall common in textbooks. Regarding Dimension 6, although Biber (2002) did not pecifically address this aspect, Csomay (2006), which was also based on Biber's (1988) framework, suggested the high degree of on-line elaboration in the teacher-student dialogue in classroom teaching sessions. This could be understood from the fact that the discourse was produced whil discussing a given topic, with the teacher and students sharing real-time and immediate physical and mental space relations. However, this is not the case for pre-recorded Mooc lectures, which led to the planned linguistic features of the video lectures. In terms of the similarity, both the target M00Cs and classroom teaching discourse examined in Biber (2002) were charactrized by the absence of narrative features.

With respect to the scond reearch question, although all disciplines showed similar general tendencies along the six dimensions as described previousl, the comparison result revealed that there were tatisticaly significant ifferences across the four discilinary areas in every dimension. Compared to other disciplinary areas, video lectures in Arts and Humanities presented more features related to narratie and planned discourse and may include more expressions of persuasion, whereas lectures in Life Sciences displayed more salient linguistic features associated with the informational and expository discourse that is formal, non-persuasive, and abstract. For the video lectures in Physical Sciences, the involved and interactional linguistic features were more apparent, which could be un. derstood as closely related to on-line informational elaboration since some experiments were conducted in the videos. In addition, these lectures showed the lowest level of narrative concerns. Lastl, for lectures in Social Sciences, the most distinct feature was the explicit references in the discourse, meaning these video lectures were more context-independent.

The crossdisciplinary variation is in line with findings from previous studies investigating disciplinary specifities in spoken academic registers despite some deviation. For instance, Csomay (2005) suggested that class sessins in the field of Humanities exhibited most of the personalized framing features while Natural ciences classes presented the opposite features. This mirrors the result in Dimension 4 in the present study as video lectures in Arts and Humanities indeed showed the most tendency to incorporate expressions of persuasion to reach a personalized discourse.In addition, in Biber (206), clasoom teaching in Humanities and Social Sciences shared more similarities regarding the dimension related to narrtive orientation as they both were more likely to incorporate reconstructed accounts of past events, however, Engineering and Natural Science classes showed more non-narrative features. This pattern partiall resembles the finding in Dimension 2 in the present study. However, it is noteworthy that although the patterns of disciplinary variation might be similar between the target Mooc video lectures and traditional universty teaching, the general tedency differs gret as the vid etres refet more simir lingisti rewriten ami rsters rater thn unversity lecture language.

Limitations existed in the present study. First, the cross-disciplinary variation was conducted by comparing four generic disci plinary areas rather than individual disciplines. Disciplines from the same academic field may sill vary substantially regarding the course content and methods of instruction. Second, although most of the instructors presented an advanced English proficiency, since they are all L2 speakers, linguistic errors may exist in the instructional language. The grammatical errors were not corrcted to preserve the original language used; however, this may influence the annotation of the transcripts and it was not feasible for the researcher to manually fix all of the tagging errors. Therefore, the final results might be slightly skewed.

Further studies may enrich the findings by conducting comparisons across specific disciplines instead of generic disciplinary areas to show more nuances acros the disciplines. Moreover, if the condition allows, further reearch may also consider carrying out comprehensive manual corrections of the annotation errors to reach more acurate final results. Lasty, i terms of the research focus and methodology, further studies may also examine Mo0 video lectres from ther countries and conduct a fullMD analysis t reveal possible new dimensions of variation.

In conclusion, the present study investigated linguistic features and variation of an emerging academic spoken discourse, Englishmedium Mooc video lectures in China. The results of the study have demonstrated the characteristics of the vide lectures similar to written academic dicourse, which dfer from the lingistic fatures intraditional universty lecture. Cross-disciplinary variation has also been detected in this study, complementing the existing findings regarding crossdisciplinary specificities in academic registers. The findings of this study are hoped to provide some insights for universties in EAL countrie to further design English-medium MOOC video lectures to serve diverse audiences.
