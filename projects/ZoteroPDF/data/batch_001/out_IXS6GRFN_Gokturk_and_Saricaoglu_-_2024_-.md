Keywords: Conference abstracts Rhetorical analysis Syntactic complexity analysis

This study explored the characteristics of accepted conference abstracts (CAs) written by language teachers for a large-scale national conference on English Language Teaching (Best Practices in Language Education Conference; BEST) compared to those produced by researchers or teacherresearchers for the teaching-oriented strands of a large-scale international conference on Applied Linguistics (American Association of Applied Linguistics Conference; AAAL). The comparative analysis focused on three rhetorical features of the abstracts (move-step realization, embeddedness, and sequence) and move-specific syntactic complexity features. Adopting the CA move/step framework of Yoon and Casal (2020a), we examined rhetorical functions and syntactic features in 60 abstracts from each conference: all BEST abstracts and the abstracts accepted to the two pedagogy-oriented strands of the AAAL conference. Our findings generally indicate prominent differences between BEST and AAAL writers in their use of moves, steps, and embedded steps. They also show differences between the two groups in terms of the use of some syntactic measures, such as the length of sentences and the use of complex nominals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of the CA genre and provide insight into language teachers’ research literacy with a focus on CA writing, which may be useful for the development of evidence-based CA writing guidelines for teachers.

# 1. Introduction

Conference abstracts (CAs) play an important role in both the academic lives of scholars and the professional development of teachers, as conferences serve as a platform for the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of scientific and pedagogical knowledge (Samar et al., 2014; Yoon & Casal, 2020a). Recognized as a “critical gate-keeping genre” (Payant & Hardy, 2016, p. 1), CAs have garnered significant attention in move analysis research (e.g., Cutting, 2012; Kaplan et al., 1994; Yoon & Casal, 2020a). While existing studies on CAs offer valuable insights into rhetorical moves and linguistic features that characterize this genre, they have often analyzed these two aspects independently in abstracts without establishing a meaningful link between the two. Such studies have received criticism from genre analysts due to privileging either function or form (Lu et al., 2021) and creating a gap between form and function, which is called by Moreno and Swales (2018) as “the form-function gap” (p. 41). Separating function from form or form from function contradicts the functional view of language, which conceptualizes language as a resource for meaning-making in real life, not as a set of rules independent from their situational contexts (Martin, 1986; Matthiessen, 1990). The same view applies to language use in disciplinary genres because “writers’ use of linguistic features characteristic of disciplinary genres is function-specific” (Lu et al., 2021, p. 3). Pedagogically, understanding the connection between linguistic forms used in CAs and the rhetorical functions they serve will better equip academic writers with the skills necessary to present their work to gatekeepers (Christie, 1989; Lu et al., 2021; Swales & Najjar, 1987).

Addressing this gap, several researchers have employed a “function-first” approach to genre analysis, in which they first identified communicative functions and then the recurrent linguistic forms associated with each function. While this approach has been shown to be useful for understanding the characteristics of different genres in academic discourse, it has been mainly applied to the genre of research articles (RAs) and student assignment registers (e.g., Cortes, 2013; Durrant & Mathews-Aydınlı, 2011; Le & Harrington, 2015). To the best of our knowledge, except for the study by Yoon and Casal (2020b), who examined formulaic phrase frames across different rhetorical moves and steps in a corpus of applied linguistics CAs, a function-first approach has been rarely employed within the CA genre. Given the crucial role of CAs in disciplinary knowledge dissemination and academic socialization (Simon-Maeda, 2016), more genre analysis studies are needed to explore various features of CA writing, with a particular focus on the form-function relationship. This study addresses one of these features, syntactic complexity, a key characteristic of academic writing (Casal & Lee, 2019; Lu, 2010; Wu et al., 2020) that remains largely unexplored within the genre of CAs. Thus, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this genre, it is essential to conduct further research that maps rhetorical moves/steps with syntactic complexity features.

Additionally, the existing CA research has predominantly focused on abstracts authored by researchers, with little attention given to those produced by teachers. Considering the pivotal role of research engagement in teacher professional development (e.g., BERA-RSA, 2014; Eriksen & Brevik, 2023) and the significant contribution of conferences to the dissemination of scientific and pedagogical knowledge, it becomes imperative for teachers to improve their ability to produce quality CAs. Insights obtained from a large-scale national conference for language teachers in Türkiye highlight the need to provide teachers with guidance on effective CA writing. To better understand the needs of teachers and inform the design of relevant teacher training courses, it is crucial to delve into the specific characteristics of CAs produced by teachers.

In an effort to bridge the identified gaps in the literature and cater to the practical needs of teacher writers, the current study undertakes an examination of two distinct corpora of CAs, one sourced from a national conference for language teachers (Best Practices in Language Education; BEST) and another from an international conference for researchers and teacher-researchers in applied lin guistics (American Association of Applied Linguistics; AAAL). Through a comparative analysis of these two corpora in terms of rhetorical moves and their syntactic realizations, this study aims to not only contribute to a nuanced understanding of the CA genre but also lay the groundwork for the development of evidence-based guidelines on CA writing.

# 1.1. Previous research on conference abstracts as a genre

As a promotional genre, CAs are written primarily to sell research (Halleck & Connor, 2006). Based on abstracts, conference re viewers decide on the acceptance or rejection of papers, and conference attendees choose which presentations to attend (e.g., Egbert & Plonsky, 2015; Samar et al., 2014). Given their critical role in the dissemination of scientific knowledge, it is not surprising that CAs have received considerable attention from applied linguistics researchers (e.g., Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Cutting, 2012; Kaplan et al., 1994; Simon-Maeda, 2016; Stein, 1997; Uysal, 2014; Yoon & Casal, 2020a).

Most of the studies on CAs have focused on identifying rhetorical characteristics of this genre to derive evidence-based guidelines for CA writers and inform English for Academic Purposes (EAP) writing pedagogy. Specifically, studies have examined different rhetorical moves (i.e., text segments that serve a particular communicative goal (Swales, 2004) and their distributions in the abstracts, using mainly Swale’s 1990, 2004 move-step framework. Their findings indicate that various moves related to introduction, methods, results, and discussion frequently occur in CAs. For example, in their analysis of 294 abstracts submitted to the AAAL Conference, Kaplan et al. (1994) found that accepted abstracts included the moves Establishing the field, Summarizing previous research, Showing a gap in the literature, Describing research methods, and Presenting results more often than rejected ones. Of these moves, Establishing the field, Describing research methods, and Presenting results were found to appear in more than half of the accepted abstracts. Similar findings were also reported by Egbert and Plonsky (2015), who investigated the relationship between the use of four types of moves and reviewer scores given to 287 abstracts submitted to the Second Language Research Forum. The abstracts with methods and results moves were found to receive statistically significantly higher reviewer scores than those without these moves. In another study on the AAAL Conference, Yoon and Casal (2020a) also reported that five of the seven moves were highly frequent in 625 accepted abstracts: Move 1: Establishing a research territory, Move 3: Occupying the niche, Move 4: Describing research design, Move 5: Elucidating data analysis procedure/s, and Move 6: Discussing results. Overall, it can be stated that CAs are characterized by the frequent use of a range of rhetorical moves associated with introduction, methods, results, and discussion.

As part of the rhetorical analysis, some studies have also examined the order in which different moves occur in CAs, identifying general patterns in how rhetorical moves are sequenced in abstracts. Halleck and Connor (2006), for instance, found that the most frequent move sequence pattern in the 300 TESOL Conference abstracts was Territory Gap-Goal, and the initial and final moves in most abstracts were Territory and Means 2 (presentation method), respectively. Likewise, Yoon and Casal (2020a) observed two common patterns in the move sequences of the abstracts: either following a sequential progression from Move 1: Establishing a territory to Move 7: Describing future presentation or starting with Move 3: Occupying the niche and progressing through the rest of the moves. These results indicate the use of certain macro-level patterns of move sequences in CAs.

Going beyond sequential analyses, some studies on CAs have explored move embeddedness, which involves the combination of different rhetorical moves within the same unit of analysis (e.g., sentence). For example, Halleck and Connor (2006) noted that the Territory move was embedded in the Gap or Goal move in $4 0 \%$ of the analyzed abstracts. Yoon and Casal (2020a) also highlighted instances where Move 4: Describing research design and Move 5: Elucidating data analysis were frequently incorporated into other moves such as Move 3: Occupying the niche and Move 6: Discussing results. These observations suggest that CA authors may strategically combine certain moves as a means to condense information and meet the specific requirements of the genre.

In addition to the rhetorical organization, several studies have examined the linguistic features of CAs and have revealed that CAs mostly exhibit the characteristics of academic writing. For example, Kaplan et al. (1994) reported that the number of propositions (i.e., claims or assertions in clauses) was higher in the accepted abstracts than the rejected ones, which accords with the results of Egbert and Plonsky (2015), who found that the abstracts with more nouns were awarded statistically significantly higher scores by reviewers than those with fewer nouns. Consistent with findings on research writing (Ansarifar et al., 2018; Biber & Gray, 2011; Casal & Lee, 2019), these results suggest the informationally dense nature of CAs as a genre, in which authors may likely provide reviewers with as much information about their study as possible to get their abstracts accepted to conferences. Kaplan et al. (2014) also found that third-person pronouns and passive construction were rarely used in the abstracts, in line with the recommendations of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association for writing journal articles (APA, 2020). Interested in the relationship between the use of vague language and the stage of completion of research, Cutting (2012) analyzed a total of 106 abstracts accepted for the British Association for Applied Linguistics Conference and the Sociolinguistics Symposium, along with questionnaire responses gathered from the abstract writers. One of the main findings of the study was the pervasive use of vague language in all the abstracts, with general nouns typically used for the purposes of convenience (i.e., authors feel that further precision would be unnecessary for their arguments) or anticipation (i.e., authors prefer not giving detailed information about their results)—two non-hedging functions of vague language used in academic writing (Cutting, 2012). The findings also revealed that around half of the writers still needed to complete their data analyses at the time of abstract submission. In summary, empirical evidence suggests that linguistic features commonly observed in academic writing also occur in CAs.

The reviewed studies offer valuable insights into the characteristics of CAs as a genre; however, they exhibit limitations in two aspects. First, they mostly analyzed the rhetorical moves and linguistic features of CAs separately without establishing a meaningful link between them. Furthermore, their analyses were mostly confined to specific linguistic structures, such as tense, personal pronouns, and nouns, neglecting an essential aspect of academic writing: syntactic complexity (Ansarifar et al., 2018; Biber & Gray, 2011; Casal & Lee, 2019). Second, the majority of the studies were conducted on abstracts written by researchers rather than teachers. Given the importance of attending conferences for teacher professional development, it is crucial for teachers to master the rhetorical and lin guistic features of CAs. Thus, research that investigates the rhetorical-linguistic link with a focus on syntactic complexity in CAs produced by teachers is needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of this genre and form a basis for the development of CA writing guidelines for teachers—a gap we address in the present study.

# 1.2. Previous research on genre-specific syntactic complexity analysis

Written syntactic complexity refers to the range and degree of sophistication and elaboration of grammatical features in written language (Ortega, 2015). As a multidimensional construct, syntactic complexity is operationalized and analyzed at various structural levels such as global, clausal, and phrasal. Many studies have employed both large-grained indices (e.g., number of clauses per sentence or mean length of clause) and fine-grained indices (e.g., number of adjective modifiers or a prepositional modifier) to examine the syntactic features of different types of written texts (e.g., essays or research papers) produced by different groups of writers (e.g., expert writers, language learners, L1 writers or ESL/EFL writers) (Ai & Lu, 2013; Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021; Casal et al., 2021; Lan et al., 2022; Lu & Ai, 2015; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Nasseri, 2021; Yin et al., 2021; Yoon & Polio, 2017).

While syntactic complexity has long been utilized in applied linguistics research to measure learner development and proficiency in second language (L2) writing, it is now widely adopted as an indicator of advanced-level academic writing to analyze the academic writing practices of experts in different disciplines (Casal et al., 2021). In line with the EAP efforts to explore the distinctive features of academic language in different genres, numerous corpus-based analyses have been conducted on expert writing, addressing different types of syntactic features. For instance, Ruan (2018) compared the abstracts of applied linguistics RAs written by native English writers with those composed by Chinese writers, focusing on noun phrase complexity. Findings revealed significant differences be tween the two groups in the use of simple and complex noun phrases in RA abstracts, with Chinese writers employing more complex noun phrases and native English writers using simpler noun phrases. Wu et al. (2020) investigated the use of syntactic structures in RAs produced by writers of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) compared to those written in American English. They reported substantial differences in several syntactic features, with ELF RAs including longer sentences, more coordinate phrases, and more complex nominal phrases than those in American English.

These studies highlight the role of syntactic complexity in disciplinary research writing practices and the variation in writers’ syntactic preferences (Casal et al., 2021). However, most of the existing studies on syntactic complexity focused on language forms, providing a “a structural, form-only” understanding of syntactic complexity (Ortega, 2015, p. 86). These studies lack a focus on the form-function relationship, ignoring the functional dimension of grammar (Halliday, 1990; Halliday & Hasan, 1989); that is, how certain syntactic structures are used in particular contexts and social activities to achieve certain communicative goals. With this gap between form and function (Moreno & Swales, 2018), researchers overlook the fact that writers use linguistic features for specific rhetorical purposes; thus, their choices of syntactically complex structures within their disciplinary writings are function-specific (Lu et al., 2021). Not establishing a relation between syntactic structures and rhetorical functions they realize is also not beneficial from a pedagogical perspective when trying to support academic writers’ skills to present their work to gatekeepers for dissemination purposes (Christie, 1989; Swales & Najjar, 1987). A disconnection between the formal and the functional dimensions of syntactic complexity may negatively affect the instructional efforts in academic writing, leading to contextually inappropriate use of complex

yntactic structures by novice writers (Lu, 2021; Zhou et al., 2023).

Since Ortega’s (2015) call for more meaning- and function-oriented1 syntactic complexity research and Ryshina-Pankova’s (2015) pioneering study in which she examined the use of nominalizations to realize different communicative functions in L2 writing, the functional dimension of syntactic complexity has been addressed in some research studies. Lu et al. (2020) examined the rhetorical functions and syntactic features of sentences in the introduction sections of 600 published RAs in six social science disciplines and found significant syntactic variations in sentences realizing different rhetorical functions. In a study on research paper introductions written by L2 writers, Saricaoglu et al. (2021) found significant differences in syntactic complexity features of sentences with Move 1 rhetorical functions. More specifically, sentences realizing Reviewing items of previous research function were significantly longer and contained significantly more clausal and phrasal complexity features than those realizing other rhetorical functions. Sentences per forming Claiming centrality function also demonstrated significantly more phrasal complexity features. More recently, Zhou et al. (2023) have investigated the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in RA introductions in 300 published RAs in six science disciplines. They found Move 1: Establishing a territory to be the most syntactically complex in terms of the use of nominalizations and complex nominals than Move 2: Establishing a niche and Move 3: Presenting the present work.

Combining the formal analysis of syntactic features with the functional analysis of rhetorical purposes is highly meaningful in contributing to the “EAP aim of exploring the linguistic realizations of writers’ rhetorical goals by analyzing writers’ variable use of syntactically complex structures” (Casal et al., 2021, p. 2). This approach aligns with a functionalist view of language, suggesting that complex structures are function-oriented and created in specific communicative contexts and social activities (Halliday, 1990; Halliday & Hasan, 1989). While the studies reviewed above have made invaluable contributions to the meaning dimension of syntactic complexity, they are limited to the RA genre. The CA genre has received only scant attention from researchers except for Yoon and Casal (2020b), who investigated the use of p-frames (phrase frames, i.e., recurring multiword units with one variable slot in any position (Fletcher, 2011)) in rhetorical moves/steps and the association of p-frames with individual moves/steps in 625 AAAL CAs. Their findings revealed the use of certain p-frames across rhetorical functions, with some p-frames “serving as “general” academic frames (e.g., in the [context, frameworks, case, etc.] of the), whereas others are more closely associated with a particular function, serving as “specialized” frames (e.g., study aims to [explore, illuminate, measure, examine, etc.]) (Yoon & Casal, 2020a, p. 296). Given the role of conferences in knowledge dissemination and academic socialization (Simon-Maeda, 2016), investigating the link between rhetorical functions and linguistic features in the CA genre is essential. One of these linguistic features is syntactic complexity, an important characteristic of disciplinary academic writing practices (Casal & Lee, 2019; Lu, 2010; Wu et al., 2020). Examining the syntactic realizations of different rhetorical functions in CAs will contribute to our understanding of the role of complex structures in this genre, broadening the scope of the existing research on this topic beyond the RA genre.

# 1.3. Teachers’ conference abstract writing skills

Integrating research into the teaching profession is crucial for fostering the ongoing professional development of teachers. This integration contributes to the overall quality of instruction by informing effective teaching and learning practices (Evans et al., 2017; Winch et al., 2013). Thus, it is important for teachers to be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage with and in research (BERA-RSA, 2014).

Conferences stand out as a prominent avenue for teachers to immerse themselves in research. Attending these events not only facilitates the exchange of ideas with peers but also allows educators to disseminate scientific and pedagogical knowledge, fostering a community of practice that seeks to improve teaching methodologies through research. However, to actively participate in confer ences, teachers must demonstrate the ability to write abstracts that adhere to the necessary conventions of this genre. Thus, CA writing can be viewed as an essential aspect of teacher research literacy, which involves the ability to “judiciously use, apply, and develop research as an integral part of one’s teaching” (Evans et al., 2017, p. 404). This literacy encompasses the ability to read, comprehend, and critically evaluate existing research (Shank & Brown, 2007) and conduct research on issues encountered in educational contexts (Gutman & Genser, 2017). Recent studies on teacher education and professional development highlight the importance of research literacy as a key dimension of teacher professional identity (e.g., Atay, 2007; Eriksen & Brevik, 2023).

In the context of the current study, the need to improve teachers’ CA writing skills became evident during the organization of a national conference for language teachers. Organized by the Board of Education at the Ministry of National Education in Türkiye in 2022, the Best Practices in Language Education Conference aimed to disseminate research-based effective language teaching practices in alignment with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and its Companion Volume across the nation. The coauthor of this paper served as the chair of the conference. A total of 530 abstracts were submitted for consideration, and following a rigorous review process, 61 abstracts were accepted, resulting in an acceptance rate of $1 1 . 5 0 \%$ .

The BEST conference was a notable accomplishment, featuring intellectually stimulating and insightful presentations and attracting attendees from various regions of Türkiye. Despite its success, the conference unveiled several difficulties faced by language teachers in abstract writing. An examination of the submitted abstracts revealed a lot of instances where the teachers could not clearly and concisely articulate the significance and methodology of their research. Many abstracts also lacked the precision and clarity needed to effectively communicate research objectives. Additionally, feedback from the review process highlighted recurring issues related to the rhetorical organization of the abstracts. These observations indicate the need to provide language teachers with detailed guidance on CA writing. This study aims to address this practical need by analyzing the characteristics of CAs produced by the successful BEST writers in comparison to those written for a large-scale international conference on Applied Linguistics (AAAL). While the study has been motivated by a local need, its implications may extend to other contexts where teachers are encouraged to actively participate in educational research as part of their professional development.

# 1.4. Present study

Given the research gaps identified in the previous CA literature and the practical need to support language teachers in CA writing, we set out to compare abstracts accepted for a large-scale international conference on Applied Linguistics (AAAL) and a large-scale local conference on English Language Teaching (BEST) in terms of rhetorical moves and steps and move-specific syntactic complexity features. Specifically, we address the following research questions (RQs).

1. What are the similarities and differences between the two CA corpora in (a) move-step realization, (b) embeddedness, and (c) sequence? 2. What are the similarities and differences between the two CA corpora in move-specific syntactic complexity features?

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. BEST corpus

The BEST corpus comprised 60 abstracts, which amounted to 27,514 words $( M = 4 5 8 . 5 5$ , $S D = 4 4 . 9 1 $ ). These abstracts ranged from 350 to 500 words, in accordance with the word count requirement of the conference. As authors were given the option to submit their abstracts in Turkish or English, 40 of the abstracts were in Turkish, while 20 of them were in English. All abstracts submitted to the conference underwent a rigorous double-anonymized review process, in which each abstract was evaluated by at least two experts using a 4-point analytic rating scale with four criteria: (a) alignment of the reported practice with targeted learning outcomes and learner developmental characteristics, (b) problem analysis and goals, (c) methodology, and (d) results and recommendations. Only the abstracts accepted for paper presentations were included in the corpus. These accepted abstracts were published in May 2022 on the conference website: https://dilegitimindeiyiuygulamalar.meb.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/program-kitabi-12-05-V2. pdf.

# 2.2. AAAL corpus

The AAAL corpus used in this study contains 60 abstracts with a total of 17,529 words $( M = 2 9 2 . 1 5$ , $S D = 1 4 . 8 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). The abstracts were selected from the two pedagogy-oriented strands of the AAAL conference: Teacher Education, Beliefs, and Identities (TED, $n =$ 30) and Second and Foreign Language Pedagogy (PED, $n = 3 0 .$ ). While more abstracts were available in each strand, the first thirty were chosen from each to match the number of abstracts in the BEST corpus. Abstracts were selected from the 2019 conference since conference programs beyond that year were not accessible online at the time of the corpus compilation. All the abstracts were paper presentations and are freely available at the AAAL’s website: https://aaal.confex.com/aaal/2019/meetingapp.cgi/Subject/14 and https://aaal.confex.com/aaal/2019/meetingapp.cgi/Subject/20.

# 2.3. Rhetorical analysis

To answer the first research question, we conducted move-step coding, including embeddedness and sequence coding, on the two corpora. For the move-step coding, we adopted the move-step framework that Yoon and Casal (2020a) developed for applied linguistics CAs (see Table 1). Because the BEST corpus was more pedagogy-oriented, focusing on the pedagogical practices, problems, needs, implementations, and implications, we made additions to the steps to equally address and capture the practical/pedagogical aspects reported in the CAs. Our additions to the framework are presented in bold in Table 1.

After transferring the abstracts to an Excel sheet sentence by sentence, we first manually coded moves and steps at sentence boundaries. However, because several sentences included move-step combinations due to “space-saving strategies that result in propositionally dense text with linguistically ambiguous rhetorical boundaries” (Yoon & Casal, 2020a, p. 465), we coded moves and steps at two levels as primary moves and steps for move-step realization, which was done at sentence boundaries, and secondary moves and steps for embeddedness, which was done at clause or phrase boundaries. We define embeddedness as the occurrence of two or more rhetorical moves and steps within the same sentence, with each step serving a distinct rhetorical function. Table 2 displays example codes from our dataset for both move-step realization (Primary MS) and embeddedness (Secondary MS), with the embedded (secondary) moves and steps italicized. Sentences in the table, which include both a primary move/step and a secondary move/step, are examples with embedded rhetorical functions.

Following the methodologies of Yoon and Casal (2020a) and Wang (2023), all abstracts were coded into two categories in terms of sequence: opening moves and move sequences. To identify the opening moves of the abstracts, the first sentences were coded at the primary level. To identify move sequences, the abstracts were initially coded for the progression of moves (e.g., $1 { - } 2 - 4 { - } 5 )$ , and the resulting numeric sequences were analyzed using a Python script developed to identify and count different combinations of two-, three-, four-, five-, and six-move sequences within the abstracts. The Python script was run separately on each corpus to generate the frequency lists of different move sequences for comparative analysis. Based on these lists, the move sequences with the highest fre quencies in each corpus were identified, allowing for a comparison of the most commonly used move sequences between the two corpora.

The two researchers collaboratively annotated all the abstracts in the AAAL corpus, comparing codes and resolving disagreements through discussion. Then, the second researcher coded the BEST corpus. To assess inter-coder reliability, the first researcher inde pendently coded a randomly selected subset of the BEST abstracts $n = 1 2$ ; $2 0 \%$ ). The analysis was conducted separately at the move and step levels, using percentage agreement as a metric (Rau & Shih, 2021). The results revealed a high level of agreement between the two researchers, with $8 9 \%$ at the move level and $8 3 \%$ at the step level. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, and the first researcher was consulted throughout the rest of the coding process when the coder had any questions related to the moves and steps of sentences.

Given the variation in abstract lengths across the corpora, the raw counts of moves and steps counts were normalized to 300 words per abstract, a common word limit for CAs. The normed frequency counts were then rounded to the nearest whole number to facilitate the interpretation of results and used for statistical analyses.

# 2.4. Syntactic complexity analysis

The common language between the BEST and AAAL corpora was English. As there were only 20 abstracts written in English in the BEST corpus, it was not possible to include the entire corpus in the syntactic complexity analysis. To ensure balanced data across different corpora for comparative analysis, 20 abstracts were randomly selected from the AAAL corpus, with 10 abstracts from each of the TED and PED strands. Consistent with the methodologies of Lu et al. (2020, 2021), and Yin et al. (2023), the sentence was chosen as the unit of analysis, which enabled the examination of the use of complex structures in individual sentences in relation to the primary move within each sentence. Thus, all sentences tagged with a specific primary move within each abstract were compiled in a text file, resulting in several files for each abstract. The number of text files created was uneven across abstracts because not all primary moves occurred in all the abstracts.

Each text file was analyzed employing the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA), a freely available tool designed to measure the syntactic complexity of texts produced by L2 writers (Lu, 2010). This tool was chosen over other tools, such as Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004), because of its full functionality during the data analysis period, proven reliability with L2 writing data (Lu, 2010; Polio & Yoon, 2018; Yoon & Polio, 2017), and extensive use in L2 academic writing research (e.g., Casal & Lee, 2019; Jiang et al., 2019; Lu & Ai, 2015; Yoon & Polio, 2017; Zhang & Lu, 2022). It has also been successfully applied in several studies to examine differences between novice and expert writers in terms of the syntactic complexity of the academic texts they produced (Yin et al., 2021, 2023)—a goal similar to that of the current research. After processing the text files, no normalization was applied to the output data because all syntactic complexity measures were calculated as ratios using production units for each individual text (Yin et al., 2021).

Given the small size of the two corpora, four measures were selected for analysis from 14 measures computed by the L2SCA after examining correlations among move-specific measures in three categories: the length of production unit, the amount of subordination, and the degree of phrasal elaboration (for correlation matrices, see Appendix A). The amount of coordination was excluded from the analysis because initial move-level analyses of the data did not reveal any notable differences between the two corpora regarding this category. Since most measures within each category were highly correlated with each other $\acute { \boldsymbol { r } }$ values higher than 0.70), one or two measures were chosen from each of the three categories based on the following criteria: relevance to the characteristics of academic writing (e.g., Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Saricaoglu et al., 2021; Wu & Lei, 2020), demonstrated significance as an indicator of L2 writing quality (e.g., Casal & Lee, 2019; Golparvar & Abolhasani, 2022; Lan et al., 2022), and potential to capture various aspects of syntactic complexity without overlap. As described in Table 3, the selected measures included mean length of T-unit (MLT), dependent clauses per T-unit (DC/T), complex nominals per T-unit (CN/T), and verb phrases per T-unit (VP/T). Previous research that applied L2SCA to L2 writing samples reported correlations above 0.80 between the manual coding and automated analysis of these four measures (Lu, 2010; Polio & Yoon, 2018; Yoon & Polio, 2017).

corpora, Chi-square tests were employed. The assumptions of independence and expected frequencies (Field, 2018) were met for most of the rhetorical data. For step-level embeddedness, more than $2 0 \%$ of the cells had expected counts lower than five; thus, differences and similarities in step-level embeddedness were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Effect sizes for Chi-square tests were computed using the formula of Cramer’s V (Field, 2018).

For comparing move-specific syntactic complexity measures between the two corpora, Mann-Whitney U tests were used since the data did not meet the assumptions necessary for parametric tests. Effect sizes for these tests were calculated using the formula $\mathbf { r } = \mathbf { z } /$ $\sqrt { N }$ , where $\boldsymbol { \mathscr { z } }$ is the standardized test statistic, and $N$ is the total number of observations. They were interpreted based on the following criteria: small effect: 0.10, medium effect: 0.30, and large effect: 0.50 (Field, 2018).

Move 7 was excluded from statistical analyses because it was absent in the BEST corpus and occurred only a few times in the AAAL corpus. To mitigate the risk of Type I errors due to multiple comparisons, Bonferroni adjustments were applied to p-values. All the analyses were conducted using SPSS v26.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Similarities and differences in move-step realization

Chi-square tests revealed significant associations between corpus type (BEST versus AAAL) and both overall primary move real ization $( \mathrm { X } ^ { 2 }$ (5, $N = 2 2 0 3 ) = 2 5 5 . 6 6$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) and step realization $( \mathrm { X } ^ { 2 }$ (15, $N = 2 2 0 6 ) = 4 2 0 . 9 8$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ). Cramer’s V values for these associations were found to be 0.34 and 0.44, respectively, which suggest moderate effect sizes.

Table 4 provides chi-square test statistics for the associations between corpus type and specific moves. As seen in the table, after applying Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the AAAL corpus contained significantly more sentences realizing Move 1: Establishing a research territory, Move 3: Occupying the niche, and Move 5: Elucidating data analysis procedures. On the other hand, the BEST corpus included significantly more sentences realizing Move 4: Describing research design, and Move 6: Discussing results. The effect sizes for these five moves ranged from 0.08 to 0.25, indicating weak associations. Move 2: Establishing a niche showed no significant association with corpus type.

As shown in Table 5, results indicated significant associations between the type of corpus and the use of steps in nine out of 16 steps after Bonferroni correction was applied. In Move 1, AAAL writers employed Step 1: Claiming centrality or contextualizing and Step 3: Reviewing items of previous research significantly more often than BEST writers. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in the normed frequency of Step 2: Generalizing from research or practice. In Move 2, BEST writers produced significantly more sentences realizing Step 2: Providing justification. In Move 3, the AAAL corpus had a significantly higher frequency of both Step 1: Announcing present research and/or purposes and Step 2: Presenting research questions or hypotheses. In Move 4, the BEST corpus featured significantly more sentences realizing Step 2: Describing methodological/pedagogical approach & tools and Step 3: Rationalizing method ological/pedagogical decision than the AAAL corpus. In Move 5, AAAL writers produced significantly more instances of Step 1: Identifying theoretical/analytical/pedagogical framework hypotheses than their BEST counterparts. In Move 6, BEST writers utilized Step 3: Indicating contribution, implications, and limitations significantly more often than AAAL writers. The effect sizes were weak in all steps with significant differences, as indicated by Cramer’s V values ranging from 0.07 to 0.29.

# 3.2. Similarities and differences in move-step embeddedness

Chi-square tests indicated a significant association between corpus type (BEST versus AAAL) and overall move embeddedness (i.e., use of secondary moves): $\mathrm { X } ^ { 2 }$ (5, $N = 6 0 4 ) = 7 8 . 8 6$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ . As measured by Cramer’s V, the effect size was 0.36, suggesting a moderate association between the two.

As displayed in Table 6, the results of chi-square tests revealed that the abstracts produced by AAAL and BEST writers differed significantly in four moves with respect to embeddedness after Bonferroni correction was applied. The AAAL corpus involved significantly more sentences realizing Move 1: Establishing a research territory as secondary moves. On the other hand, the BEST corpus contained significantly more sentences realizing Move 2: Establishing a niche, Move 4: Describing research design, and Move 6: Discussing results. The two corpora were similar in the use of the following moves at the secondary level: Move 3: Occupying the niche and Move 5: Elucidating data analysis procedure/s. With a range from 0.16 to 0.30, the effect sizes for the four moves were weak.

Table 7 presents descriptive statistics for normed frequencies of step embeddedness in the BEST and AAAL corpora. Overall, several marked differences were observed between the two corpora in the use of secondary steps. The most substantial difference was in Move 1 Step 3: Reviewing items of previous research, with AAAL writers producing this step at the secondary level more often than BEST writers. Additionally, AAAL writers employed six other secondary steps more frequently than their BEST counterparts. These steps included Move 3 Step 2: Presenting research questions or hypotheses; Move 4 Step 1: Describing setting, participants, or data; Move 4 Step 2: Describing methodological/pedagogical approach and tools; Move 5 Step 1: Identifying theoretical/analytical/pedagogical framework; Move 5 Step 2: Recounting data analysis procedure & tools; and Move 5 Step 3: Rationalizing the data analysis procedure. BEST writers, on the other hand, utilized three secondary steps more often than AAAL writers. These steps involved Move 2 Step 1: Problematizing existing research or practice; Move 2 Step 1: Providing justification; Move 4 Step 3: Rationalizing methodological/pedagogical decision; and Move 6: Reporting and interpreting results.

# 3.3. Similarities and differences in move-step sequences

Table 8 reports descriptive statistics for opening moves and steps in the BEST and AAAL corpora. In both corpora, writers pre dominantly utilized Move 1 Step 2: Generalizing from research or practice to begin their abstracts, with this move being more frequently employed in the BEST corpus $( 5 0 \% )$ compared to the AAAL corpus $\left( 3 3 \% \right)$ ). In the BEST corpus, Move 2 Step 1: Problematizing existing research or practice was the second most frequent opening move-step $( 2 0 \% )$ , whereas, in the AAAL corpus, the second most frequent opening move-step was Move 1 Step 1: Claiming centrality or contextualizing $( 3 0 \% )$ . The occurrence rates of Move 2 Step 1: Problematizing existing research or practice $( 2 0 \% )$ were the same in both corpora. The less frequently employed rhetorical functions as opening moves and steps across the two corpora involved Move 2 Step 2: Providing justification, Move 3 Step 1: Announcing present research and/or purposes, and Move 4 Step 1: Describing setting, participants, or data.

Table 9 presents descriptive statistics for the most common move sequences in the two corpora. As seen in the table, almost all sequences in the AAAL corpus exhibit a linear progression, starting with Move 1 and proceeding sequentially to Move 7. In contrast, the BEST corpus displays a more mixed pattern, with some sequences progressing from Moves 1 to 6, while others following a nonsequential order (e.g., starting from Move 6 and then jumping to Move 4). Several move sequences, such as 2–3, 4-5-6, and 1-2-3- 4, were employed by both groups of writers.

# 3.4. Similarities and differences in syntactic complexity

Table 10 provides the descriptive statistics of four syntactic complexity measures for six rhetorical moves in the BEST and AAAL corpora. Overall, results indicated similarities and differences in the measures across the two corpora for each move, with the means of the measures being generally higher for the AAAL corpus than for the BEST corpus. The most substantial difference between the corpora was observed for the measure of MLT in Move 1: Establishing a research territory $( M = 2 1 . 2 0$ , $S D = 6 . 3 4 $ for BEST; $M = 3 3 . 3 6 , S D$ $= 1 1 . 3 8 $ for AAAL). For the other three measures including DC/T, CN/T, and VP/T, the differences between the corpora were most pronounced in Move 6: Discussing results $M = 0 . 6 1$ , $S D = 0 . 3 1$ for BEST; $M = 1 . 2 0$ , $S D = 0 . 7 2$ for AAAL), Move 2: Establishing a niche (M $= 2 . 8 5$ , $S D = 1 . 6 0$ for BEST; $M = 4 . 3 9$ , $S D = 1 . 9 7$ for AAAL), and Move 5: Elucidating data analysis procedure/s $M = 1 . 3 6$ , $S D = 0 . 4 9$ for BEST; $M = 2 . 3 6$ , $S D = 0 . 7 4$ for AAAL), respectively, in comparison to the other rhetorical moves.

As shown in Table 11, the results of Mann-Whitney U tests revealed statistically significant differences between the two corpora in only a handful of move-specific syntactic complexity measures after Bonferroni correction was applied. Specifically, in the context of Move 1, AAAL writers produced significantly longer T-units (MLT) and more complex noun phrases (CN/T) than the BEST writers. In sentences corresponding to Move 4, BEST writers employed significantly more dependent clauses (DC/T) than AAAL writers. As indicated by r values in Table 11, the effect sizes for these three measures were above 0.55, suggesting a substantial difference between the two groups. For Move 5, the difference in the number of verb phrases per T-unit (VP/T) between the BEST and AAAL corpora was not statistically significant despite a large effect size, potentially due to the small sample size.

complexity measures were comparable between the two corpora.

Fig. 1 illustrates the mean values of four syntactic complexity measures computed for six rhetorical moves in the two corpora. Generally, the two corpora exhibited variation in the moves with the highest and lowest means for each measure. Move 3 had the highest means for all the measures in the BEST corpus. In the AAAL corpus, different moves had the highest means for each measure: Move 1 for MLT, Move 6 for DC/T and VP/T, and Move 2 for CN/T. The lowest means for the four measures were associated with Moves 4 and 5 in both corpora. Specifically, in the BEST corpus, Move 5 had the lowest means across the four measures, whereas in the AAAL corpus, Move 5 had the lowest mean for MLT, Move 4 for DC/T, and both Moves 4 and 5 for CN/T and VP/T. These results suggest that the two corpora differ more notably in the moves with the highest means, while they are more similar in the moves with the lowest means across all the measures.

# 4. Discussion

In the current study, we examined CAs written by language teachers for a large-scale national conference on English Language Teaching (BEST) compared to those produced by researchers or teacher-researchers for the teaching-oriented strands of a large-scale international conference on Applied Linguistics (AAAL). Our comparative analysis focused on three rhetorical features of the abstracts (move-step realization, embeddedness, and sequence) and move-specific syntactic complexity features. Results revealed differences and similarities between the two CA corpora, with important implications for research and practice on CAs.

With respect to RQ1, the results indicated significant differences in the use of the majority of moves between BEST and AAAL writers. Move 1: Establishing a research territory, Move 3: Occupying the niche, and Move 5: Elucidating data analysis procedure/s were employed significantly more frequently by AAAL writers, whereas Move 4: Describing research design and Move 6: Discussing results were utilized significantly more often by BEST writers. Regarding step realization differences between the two groups of writers, the findings showed that AAAL writers claimed centrality or contextualized (Move 1 Step 1), reviewed items of previous research (Move 1 Step 3), announced present research and/or purposes (Move 3 Step 1), presented research questions or hypotheses (Move 3 Step 2), and identified theoretical/analytical/pedagogical framework (Move 5 Step 1) significantly more frequently than BEST writers. On the other hand, BEST writers provided justifications (Move 2 Step 2), described methodological/pedagogical approaches and tools (Move 4 Step 2), rationalized methodological/pedagogical decisions (Move 4 Step 3), and indicated contribution, implications, and limitations (Move 6 Step 3) significantly more often than AAAL writers.

Fig. 1. Variation of four syntactic complexity measures across six rhetorical moves in the BEST and AAAL corpora.

The higher occurrences of steps associated with Move 1, Move 3, and Move 5 in the AAAL corpus highlight the research-oriented nature of the conference. Despite selecting abstracts from two pedagogy-oriented strands of the AAAL conference (i.e., Second and Foreign Language Pedagogy and Teacher Education, Beliefs, and Identities), we observed that these abstracts were still more researchoriented than those of the BEST conference, which had a stronger focus on teaching practices. Yoon and Casal (2020a) provide insight into this phenomenon, explaining that “an overall emphasis on contributing to teaching practices versus contributing to research practices is likely to influence the writers’ choices of what to present within the space limitation” (p. 476). Similarly, the difference between AAAL and BEST writers in the use of Move 4 Step 2 appears to be linked to their focus in the abstracts—whether contributing to teaching or research practices. We noticed that BEST writers described pedagogical procedures in their studies in greater detail than AAAL writers, who briefly focused on methodological procedures. Below is an example excerpt from the BEST corpus, illustrating the use of Move 4 sentences that elaborated on pedagogical procedures.

# Excerpt 1(BEST, 15)

Participants involve 16 4th grade students studying at the Sciences and Arts Center. This study is a one-group experimental study. Before using storytelling in the courses, all the students took a pre-test that involved the target vocabulary items. After the treatment, the students took a post-test and a short interview. The stories and the materials were mainly prepared by the teacher. The popular and well-known five stories were chosen (Cinderella, Goldilocks and Three Bears, The Princess, Big Blue Fish and Small Red Fish, and The Monster Dinner). These stories were prepared by the teacher along with a visual presentation using the PowerPoint software because of the distance education. The application lasted for 5 weeks. In the pre-storytelling stage, the teacher asked the students to guess the name of the story of the lesson by presenting a few pictures. Before reading the story, the students were introduced to the new vocabulary times through pictures and gestures. Once the students identified the new words, the teacher started telling the story in the while-storytelling stage. While reading them, the teacher directed the students' attention to the PowerPoint presentation, which included the visual representation of the story to facilitate the comprehension process. The teacher introduced the story by making comments, and gestures, and asking the students about it to assess their prior knowledge. In the post-storytelling stage, the teacher gave each student one of the characters in the story and asked them to roleplay the story by either reading or memorizing the dialogues. In the end, students did some vocabulary activities and games related to the stories.

Regarding move-step embeddedness, the findings showed that AAAL writers used embedded steps more frequently in Move 1: Establishing a research territory. On the other hand, BEST writers embedded more steps in Move 2: Establishing a niche, Move 4: Describing research design, and Move 6: Discussing results than their AAAL counterparts. Previous research on CAs (Halleck & Connor, 2006; Yoon & Casal, 2020a) and RA abstracts (Pho, 2008) suggest the importance of move embedding as a feature of the genre of abstracts. Yoon and Casal (2020a) characterize this feature as rhetorical compression, describing CA as a rhetorically dense genre. They also consider move embedding as an indicator of “the writer’s insider ethos as a member of their disciplinary community” (p. 477). From this perspective, BEST writers appear to have adhered more closely to their disciplinary practices than AAAL writers. This finding again reflects the pedagogical focus of BEST writers in their CAs, where they commonly identified a problem in teaching/learning practices when establishing a niche in Move 2, described their pedagogical settings and rationalized their pedagogical decisions in Move 4, and indicated contributions of their pedagogical implementations and suggested implications for pedagogy in Move 6. It appears that communicating these rhetorical functions was important for BEST writers at both primary and secondary levels.

As for move-step sequences, the findings indicated similarities in the use of opening moves across both corpora. Specifically, Move 1: Establishing a research territory and Move 2: Establishing a niche were found to be the most commonly utilized opening moves in the two corpora. This alignment suggests a shared practice among AAAL and BEST writers in introducing their research topics and starting their abstracts, which reflects a standard or widely accepted approach in CA writing in the field of applied linguistics. Despite the similarities in the initial parts of the abstracts, there was substantial variation in how writers organized their ideas throughout the rest of their abstracts. Various move combinations were noted in both corpora, echoing the observations made by Yoon and Casal (2020a). Their work suggests that a linear move sequence may not be obligatory in CA writing, emphasizing the dynamic nature of genres. In line with this perspective, Hyland (2015) underscores that as “typified acts of communication,” genres tend to emphasize similarity over difference while they afford individuals the freedom to improvise or play with genres—a concept the researcher refers to as “some personal wriggle-room” (p. 33). Examining move sequences within the AAAL corpus, we observed a trend toward a more linear progression, which contributes to a more straightforward and structured organization of ideas. Conversely, the BEST corpus exhibited a more non-sequential order, suggesting that BEST writers tended to have a less structured or more varied approach to organizing content in their abstracts.

With regard to RQ2, the results indicated that move-specific syntactic complexity measures were generally comparable across both corpora, with a few notable exceptions. Each of the four measures (MLT, DC/T, CN/T, and VP/T) was significant or approached significance in only one of the rhetorical moves between the two corpora. Specifically, when formulating sentences that realized the rhetorical function of Move 1: Establishing a research territory, AAAL writers were found to produce significantly longer T-units than BEST writers. This means that AAAL writers situated their studies in a broader research context by giving more background infor mation than their counterparts, which indicates a heightened research orientation in the AAAL corpus. Several move analysis studies comparing RAs from different disciplines in syntactic features have provided evidence that long units of production are a distinctive feature of academic writing in social sciences such as Applied Linguistics (e.g., Dong et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Typically used for dense information packaging, these sentences help improve communication efficiency in academic writing (Wu et al., 2020). It is also interesting to note that AAAL writers were more frequently engaged in reviewing items of previous research (Step 3) than their BEST counterparts. The widespread use of this rhetorical step may have increased the length of the relevant sentences in the AAAL corpus, which accords with previous research findings suggesting that sentences realizing Step 3: Reviewing items of previous research tend to be longer than those serving other rhetorical functions (Saricaoglu et al., 2021).

For Move 1, the use of more complex noun phrases per T-unit in the AAAL corpus compared to the BEST corpus indicates differences in the informational density of this move between the two corpora. Similar results were also reported by Zhou et al. (2023), who found that Move 1 contained more nominalizations and complex nominals than Move 2 and Move 3. These structures play a crucial role in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2016), facilitating the compression of rich information in texts, thereby saving space for writers (Ansarifar et al., 2003, 2018). Hence, along with the results obtained for MLT, the findings suggest that BEST writers may be less familiar with the disciplinary conventions of academic writing than AAAL writers, possibly due to their lower exposure to academic texts. Below are example excerpts that demonstrate the use of Move 1 in the two corpora, with complex noun phrases underlined.

(Chan et al., 2015). [Move 1]

The findings also showed that BEST writers used more dependent clauses per T-unit in Move 4: Describing research design than their AAAL counterparts. As exemplified in Excerpts 4–7, BEST writers appear to have a stronger tendency to unpack information in finite dependent clauses than AAAL writers when describing the methodology of their research. These findings are inconsistent with the norms of academic writing as subordination, characterized by the use of dependent clauses, has been shown to be more associated with spoken discourse than written academic texts (Biber et al., 2011). The findings also differ from those of studies on RA sections, which often indicate that abstracts tend to have a higher density of complex noun phrases and lower use of finite dependent clauses than the other sections because of the need to condense key information within a specified word limit (e.g., Yin et al., 2021). This discrepancy could be attributed to BEST writers’ inadequate knowledge of academic writing conventions, which might have led them to rely on expressions common in conversational discourse, which they then carried over into their abstracts. Furthermore, the AAAL corpus exhibited a higher number of verb phrases per T-unit in Move 5: Elucidating data analysis procedure/s compared to the BEST corpus—a difference that was nearly statistically significant. This finding indicates that the AAAL writers used more concise language in this move than BEST writers, which may have contributed to a more efficient presentation of data analysis procedures. Overall, BEST writers’ limited use of phrasal complexity features indicates the need for guidance or training for teachers on how to incorporate these features into their writing to better meet the standards of academic writing.

Excerpt 7AAALTED5 After that, using constant comparative method (Glaser 2005)relevant codes generated from the first cycle coding were grouped together in order to identify emerging themes related to a research question.

The results further revealed differences between the two corpora in syntactic complexity patterns across rhetorical moves. Spe cifically, AAAL writers’ use of syntactic complexity features was more consistent throughout the abstracts as the features occurred in various moves (Move 1, Move 6, and Move 2). On the other hand, BEST writers’ syntactic complexity features appeared predominantly in a single move (Move 3). As Biber and Conrad (2009) argued, different communicative goals require using different grammatical structures. This interpretation is further supported by research showing substantial variation in the use of complex syntactic structures across rhetorical moves within a specific genre (e.g., Casal et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021). Extending this argument to the CA genre, it can be speculated that BEST and AAAL writers differed in their complex writing skills. The varied use of syntactically complex structures by AAAL writers across different moves might indicate their ability to adjust syntax according to specific communicative goals, unlike BEST writers, who predominantly utilized complex syntactic structures in only one move. These findings point to AAAL writers’ higher level of familiarity with academic writing conventions or higher proficiency in academic writing skills than BEST writers.

Taken together, the variations observed in the use of rhetorical functions and their syntactic realizations between AAAL and BEST writers highlight a fundamental aspect of genres: “genres are not fixed” (Frow, 2006, p. 3). As socially defined and dynamic constructs (Devitt, 2004), genres evolve in response to various social exigencies (Swales, 2009). Thus, variation is an inherent characteristic of genres, allowing for creative possibilities (Tardy, 2016). From this standpoint, one potential explanation for the observed variation in this study relates to the target audience (Hyon, 1996). For AAAL writers, the audience mainly comprises researchers or applied lin guists, while for BEST writers, the audience consists of language practitioners or teachers. Considering their primary audience, BEST writers might have opted for subordination in the methodology section to provide more detailed descriptions, enhancing clarity and comprehensibility for their intended readers. Another potential explanation for the observed variation concerns identity in academic writing (Tardy, 2016). BEST writers appear to have expressed their teacher-author identities using the existing conventions of CA writing differently (Hyland, 2012). In their CAs, there was more focus on teaching and learning problems, processes of pedagogical implementations, and implications of findings, which were mainly communicated via Move 2, Move 4, and Move 6. These variations in the teacher written CAs illustrate the importance of context in genre analysis: context accounts not only for the way writers construct texts but also for how others interpret and use them in their professional contexts (Bhatia, 2004). From these perspectives, BEST writers’ CAs, which prominently feature their teacher identities and pedagogical contexts, may be considered creative or innovative, reflecting the dynamic and socially constructed nature of genres. However, the key to such variations is their effectiveness, as Tardy (2016) emphasizes. Thus, it is necessary to track the textual regularities and irregularities by considering the specific social situations and the rhetorical needs that these situations create to fully comprehend texts (Swales, 2009). The anecdotal evidence gathered from BEST reviewers about the abstracts (e.g., suggestions for more explicit research objectives) indicated that certain variations in BEST writers’ CAs may not have improved the communication of their research to their audiences, which motivated the present study. By identifying where teacher written CAs depart from the conventions of the CA genre, our findings suggest that teachers can write more effective CAs by better adhering to the rhetorical and syntactic characteristics of this academic genre while retaining their teacher identities and pedagogical focuses.

It is important to note that the results of this study must be considered in light of several limitations. First, the abstract corpora utilized were sourced exclusively from two conferences, which may not fully represent the domain of applied linguistics conferences. Thus, to enhance the generalizability of the findings, future research should include abstracts from a wider range of applied linguistics conferences. Second, the syntactic complexity analysis was conducted on small subsets of the BEST and AAAL corpora, using only four complexity measures. To provide a more thorough understanding of the characteristics of the CA genre in terms of syntactic complexity, further research that examines a broader set of measures in larger CA corpora should be undertaken. Third, this study included only accepted CAs in rhetorical and syntactic complexity analyses. To offer a more comprehensive understanding of the features of CAs as a genre and the needs of teachers in abstract writing, a valuable addition would be the examination of both accepted and rejected CAs. Unfortunately, this was not feasible in the present study because rejected abstracts for both conferences (BEST and AAAL) were unavailable. Hence, future research should explore ways to address this practical constraint for a more thorough investigation. Last, while it would be insightful to gather the BEST teachers’ perceptions about the usefulness of the findings of textual analysis for addressing their professional needs, it was not possible to do so in the current study because no contact information for the teachers was provided in the conference program due to personal data safety regulations in Türkiye.2 In future research, training sessions could be organized with teachers using materials developed based on the results of the textual analysis, eliciting feedback from the teachers on the appropriateness of the materials for meeting their professional needs. Such research would not only provide ev idence for the applicability of the textual analysis findings to CA writing training but also contribute to the design of research literacy programs for teachers.

Despite its limitations, this study holds important implications for research and pedagogy on CAs. In terms of research, the findings of the study contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of the CA genre by revealing differences and similarities in rhetorical moves and syntactic complexity features between two CA corpora, which were drawn from a national and an international conference in applied linguistics. The findings suggest that authors may use certain rhetorical moves more frequently than others depending on the goals of conferences (research-versus teaching-oriented) and combine different moves to pack information, meeting the specific requirements of the CA genre. They also provide insight into discursive variation within move sequences while highlighting consistency in macro-level patterns—a phenomenon Youn and Casal (2020a) described as “variation within consistency” (p. 476). Furthermore, the results of the study indicate that CAs exhibit the characteristics of academic writing in terms of syntactic complexity. They show that sentences corresponding to certain moves, such as Move 1, tend to be longer and include more complex noun phrases than those fulfilling other rhetorical functions, which provides evidence for the need to condense meaning to communicate effectively in the CA genre.

Regarding pedagogy, the findings of this study provide some insight into language teachers’ research literacy with a focus on CA writing (Evans et al., 2017). As highlighted by research on teacher education (e.g., BERA-RSA, 2014), it is crucial for teachers to have the necessary knowledge and skills to engage with and in research for effective teaching practices. Given the significant role that conferences play in the exchange and dissemination of scientific and pedagogical knowledge, an integral aspect of teacher research literacy lies in the ability to craft CAs in adherence to the conventions of this genre. The results of the present study suggest that language teachers may benefit from explicit training on CA writing with a focus on rhetorical functions and syntactic complexity features. In these training programs, it is essential to introduce teachers to the concepts of genre and move and raise their awareness about the communicative goals realized in the CA genre, and the language used to realize these rhetorical moves. The training objectives may be achieved by providing teachers with move-step frameworks, such as the one utilized in this study (Yoon & Casal, 2020a) along with sample annotated CAs that either conform to or deviate from the targeted move-step framework, and by allowing them to work on the samples based on the framework. In summary, this study not only enhances our understanding of the features of the CA genre but also offers insights into how CAs written by language teachers differ from the relevant genre conventions, which could be helpful in the development of evidence-based CA writing guidelines for this particular group.
