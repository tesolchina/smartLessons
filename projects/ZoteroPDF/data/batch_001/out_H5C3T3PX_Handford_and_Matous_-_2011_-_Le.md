The purpose of this research is to identify and interpret statistically significant lexicogrammatical items that are used in on-site spoken communication in the international construction industry, initially through comparisons with reference corpora of everyday spoken and business language. Several data sources, including audio and video recordings, interviews, expert informant insights and observation notes are operationalised to understand the context that the lexicogrammatical items reflexively constitute, for instance the discursive practices the engineers invoke in their working day. As in other workplaces, several types of interpersonal items are statistically significant when compared to everyday talk, such as deontic modality, hedges and fillers, certain back channels and the pronoun we. Also, place deixis is statistically significant in this specific context, and is often accompanied by nonverbal communication and visual images. These findings shed light on the way power and solidarity are negotiated in this context, and on the importance of face. In conclusion, the authors recommend training for inexperienced engineers and engineering students that develops their problem-solving, relationship-building and communication skills.

# 1. Introduction

In an export-led economy like Japan, effective international communication, usually in English, takes on a special relevance, not least in the Japanese construction industry which is recognized as having entered a very mature phase in its domestic market (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, 2010). The importance of communication in the international construction industry was noted over a decade ago by Loosemore and Muslmani, writing in the International Journal of Project Management that ‘‘in an increasingly international construction market, communication problems will emerge as one of the most significant contemporary challenges facing construction project managers’’ (1999, p. 95).

Most recently, in view of the declining domestic need for further public infrastructure development, the central government has recommended Japanese construction companies further expand overseas (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, 2010).

The international construction industry accounts for approximately $1 0 \%$ of the global gross domestic product (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Engineering and Construction Report, 2010), making it one of the largest industries in the world. Despite this, there seems to have been no published research exploring authentic face to face on-site spoken discourse involving employees of construction companies, Japanese or otherwise, working internationally. Nevertheless, there has been research on a related field of professional communication conducted in Hong Kong in the form of Cheng and Mok’s (2008) study of discourse processes in land-surveying. Furthermore, the publically accessible Hong Kong Corpus of Spoken English (http: $I I$ langbank.engl.polyu.edu.hk/RCPCE/) contains ESP data from a wide range of professional settings. Moreover, the written 5- million-word Hong Kong Corpus of Surveying and Construction Engineering (http://langbank.engl.polyu.edu.hk/HKCSCE/), also developed by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, is of considerable value to researchers exploring this professional domain.

By ‘on-site’ communication we mean both in the site office and on the various locations where the project is being performed, which are often outdoors. All the ‘on-site’ venues are temporary, in that once the project, or the particular stage of the project, has been completed, the company’s presence ceases. This is in contrast to the company’s premises, such as the company’s head office, which would be more permanent.

The present research is part of an interdisciplinary study based in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Tokyo. Through collaboration with a construction company that belongs among the Japanese top twenty in terms of turnover (hereafter referred to as ‘Ishihara Construction’ – the transcripts ensure anonymity, with all names changed), on-site data has been collected, not only to explore project management practices in the construction industry, but, particularly, to understand how to better prepare young project managers, both in-company and those involved in postgraduate study. The rationale on the part of the Japanese construction companies is that they want to know how to accelerate training for newer recruits, and for those with insufficient experience and practical knowledge. Specifically, the overall aim of this research project, of which this paper forms a first step, is to understand what tacit knowledge and (social, professional and discursive) practices constitute communication in international construction, so that they can be highlighted, made explicit and then appropriated in training by newer recruits (see Nonaka, 1994, for a discussion of explicitly teaching tacit practices in business).

This paper is concerned with the analysis of on-site problem-oriented discourse in the international construction industry, and its realization through critical lexical items. Specifically, we will answer the questions: How do the English interactions recorded in a Japanese company in Hong Kong (hereafter referred to as ‘the HK data’) compare at the lexicogrammatical level to everyday English and business English? How can such lexicogrammatical items be interpreted to shed light on the context they reflexively constitute? Answering these questions should enable a more detailed understanding of one area of professional international English, allowing inferences about how engineers fulfill their roles and responsibilities in authentic, as opposed to simulated, settings (see Firth, 2009).

According to Sarangi and Roberts (1999), there are three themes that make the workplace a distinct discourse environment: problem-solving/decision-making, the constitution of professional knowledge and credibility, and thirdly, role relationships, authority and identity. The quantitative findings outlined below can shed light on each of these themes. For instance, several categories of nouns will be seen to be statistically significant, and therefore constitute professional knowledge; the high number and specific range of interpersonal features indicate the attention that is paid by participants to interacting appropriately; and the statistically significant keyword (Scott, 1999) problem, plus the use of clusters involving if can partly constitute the problem-solving process in the workplace (Handford, 2010a).

# 2. Methodology

In this study, we iteratively combine in-depth qualitative information from a selected case study in combination with statistical data from large-scale corpora.

# 2.1. Context

Data was collected on a construction project involving a Japanese/Hong-Kongese/European1 joint venture (hereafter JV) in Hong Kong in December 2008. According to the Japanese key-informants, JVs are a common type of arrangement for their projects in Hong-Kong. On the one hand, Ishihara Construction itself has a long presence in the local construction sector, keeping good relationships with its main long-term client, the government. The JV partners and subcontractors on the other hand, would be different in each project. The key-informants consider the need to develop good relationships with new partners after beginning each project to be a constant requirement of the construction sector.

The two authors spent 1 week on the site in the early stage of the project, gathering a variety of data, including recordings of the actual professional communication which took place there. The second author had also visited the site the previous month to conduct some preparatory interviews with the management and visit four potential sites, of which two were chosen (because of the size of the projects, the degree of accessibility and the envisaged support for the research). Furthermore, a fellow researcher from the construction management laboratory in the department of Civil Engineering at the University of Tokyo had visited the site for a separate research project on a number of occasions, and we had access to his ethnographic data. Within the second author’s research group in the University of Tokyo there was also a Japanese employee of Ishihara Construction who had worked in Hong Kong for several years, and who was a researcher in the same laboratory. We could consult him as an expert informant when needed. He was also present in the Hong Kong project for part of the week while we collected the data.

This joint venture project itself was led by Ishihara Construction (see Appendix B) and, (excluding subcontractors) directly employed over a 100 male workers (in fact, all the interviewees and recordees were male). Only four of them were Japanese; two worked permanently in the office (a Deputy to the Project Manager and a Finance and Administration Manager), and two worked both inside and outside it (a Senior Engineer and an Engineer).

We shadowed the two Japanese engineers for 1 week and tried to record all their spoken communication. For both of them, the main communication partner was the foreman of the part of the site for which they were responsible (Fig. 1). The Japanese engineers had been working with the foremen for approximately 1 year before we started conducting the research. The two foremen (Hong-Kongese in both cases) are permanently present on the site, and supervise the local staff and local subcontractors. They were both relatively senior workers with rich experience in local construction projects, and used to work with international (including Japanese) engineers. The two Japanese engineers, while younger (early 30s) and with only 5 years of work experience in Hong Kong, were directly above the foremen in the organizational hierarchy. These two engineers were deemed highly suitable for the study’s ultimate goal of training new recruits, because they had gained more experience than a new recruit would have upon joining the company, but were not very senior.

This difference in power/status and the way it is perceived by different nationalities was raised in the ethnographic interviews. The Japanese were seen, by one of Hong Kong foremen, as being more ‘military’ in their approach to status (which we interpreted as meaning they had a more rigidly hierarchical approach), whereas the Hong Kong staff see themselves as more flexible, and tending towards a flatter, more ‘democratic’ communication and decision-making style. Such differences may lead to ‘critical incidents’ through conflicting practices and expectations, which can be further analysed and discussed by trainees (see Spencer-Oatey & Franklin, 2009, pp. 221 and 222).

In terms of the actual daily work routine, the engineers‘ day usually starts in the ‘site-office’, which is located several kilometres from the outdoor sites. This is usually followed by a visit to the outdoor site, where they discuss the progress or problems with the foremen, and review the tasks for the day with the workers. They then usually return to the office before going off to eat their lunch with the two other Japanese co-workers in a nearby eatery. Unless some urgent issues require their presence on the site, the afternoons are usually spent in the office consulting about possible solutions to any encountered technical problems with other specialists and supervisors, planning further steps for the next days, attending regular progress meetings with other departments, accounting, or writing daily progress reports.

One of the engineers occasionally used Cantonese for conversations with the foremen or the workers on the site, but except for that and for internal conversations among the Japanese staff, their communication with others was in English. In this paper, we concentrate on analysing the English communication, it being the lingua franca between the various nationalities involved in this project. However, we did not ignore Japanese words used by the engineers when speaking in English with someone, for example hai as a way of back-channelling in communication with their Hong Kong counterparts is included in the analysis. Furthermore, one of the ethnographic interviews was conducted by the researchers in Japanese (because according to the interviewee, his English level was not good enough, and he seemed concerned about his Chinese colleagues understanding some of his comments), while the other interviews were conducted in English.

# 2.2. Data gathering methods

We decided for a triangulation of several data gathering techniques. We used handheld audio and video recorders to capture the engineers’ communication. The video recording proved crucial later for analysis, as non-verbal gestures formed a large part of communication, and for interpreting some of the audio files. Because much of the communication was recorded outdoors, noise levels meant that transcription was extremely difficult, and several exchanges were indecipherable. Furthermore, the recordees indicated that they did not want certain discussions recorded. In total, we were able to transcribe just over 12,000 words of interaction. While this is not a large amount of data compared to, for example, business meetings, it should be noted that complete on-site exchanges can be very brief. In extract 1, for example, the Japanese engineer Kita is walking around the site, and notices that the subcontractors are refilling the oil in the breaker (the vehicle used to break objects such as boulders) with a long hose (Photo 1). He immediately comes up to and asks the foreman whether the breaker’s oil has already been used up, while pointing at the breaker.

Marvin: Er yesterday just only here remain half $+ \ s 0$ better we fill up - Kita: (extending next syllable) Oh.   
Marvin: before and then start [work] (2)

In addition to recording spontaneous communication, we interviewed the four Japanese, the two foremen, and a local construction manager to gain better understanding of the main issues faced by the team in this period, the nature of the discussed problems as well as the general workings of the organization. We focused on what cultural issues arise during their work, what kind of communication challenges they encounter and how they deal with them. We also collected several documents explaining details of the project and division of responsibilities among the staff. As mentioned above, the second author had also visited and interviewed several Hong Kong-based engineers (such as the British head engineer of the project we recorded) the previous month, and these interviews provided much contextual information. Finally, all this was supplemented by personal observation and extensive discussion with company employees before and after the data gathering with the expert informants, such as the researcher who was also an employee of Ishihara Construction.

# 2.3. Analysis

To address the potential criticism that a single case study provides only anecdotal evidence, the relation of our data to appropriate corpora is rigorously examined and compared with other appropriate datasets, and we make no strong claims about the generalizability of the findings. As with other recent corpus-based studies of spoken institutional discourse (Handford, 2010a, 2010b; Handford & Koester, 2010; Koester, 2006, 2010; O’Keeffe, 2006), this paper integrates quantitative and qualitative approaches to the analysis of the data. The first quantitative step is to produce statistically significant ‘keywords’ (Scott, 1999), that is, items with significantly greater or lesser than random frequency compared to some norm (in the form of a larger reference corpus). In this case, the two spoken reference corpora that have been used are the 2.7 - million word social and intimate subcorpus of CANCODE (The Cambridge and Nottingham Corpus of Discourse English), and the 900,000 word meeting subcorpus of CANBEC (Cambridge and Nottingham Business Corpus). The rationale for using these corpora is that, unlike large publically accessible corpora such as the BNC (British national Corpus), these corpora are purely spoken; in addition SOCINT is the largest corpus of social and intimate (everyday) communication, and CANBEC is the largest corpus of authentic unscripted business interaction, to date. Both corpora have been developed by Nottingham University and are copyrighted by Cambridge University Press. The corpus directors are Professors Ronald Carter and Michael McCarthy. For further details on the corpora see McCarthy (1998) and Handford (2010a), respectively.

By comparing the construction data to these two spoken corpora at the lexicogrammatical level, we can begin to infer how our data compares to everyday talk, and business-meeting talk. Once quantitative searches have been conducted, selected items are interpreted in longer extracts featuring these items. Employing quantitative techniques allows us to achieve a level of objectivity and replicability that is perhaps lacking from much discourse analysis (Baker, 2006). This is not to suggest that frequency is all-important: unusual items can have considerable import, and frequent items can be uninteresting. Nevertheless, as a first step, quantitative analyses of fully transcribed complete encounters allow for the texts to be prized open with an attractive degree of interpretative objectivity.

The methodology used here has been more fully developed and explored in Handford’s (2010a, Chapter 2) study of the CANBEC corpus of business meetings and is described in the steps shown below however, it is worth emphasizing that the analysis is cyclical in that it moves between the text and the context to understand the meanings, goals, practices, identities and structures the participants have constructed through their talk (Gee, 2005). Furthermore, as the two authors of this paper were also the collectors of the various data, the first with a background in professional discourse and the second in civil engineering, we could perform the role of ‘a mediating ethnographic specialist informant to shed light on the corpus’ (Flowerdew, 2005, p. 329).

Step 1: collect and transcribe relevant textual and ethnographic data.   
Step 2: pinpoint potentially important lexicogrammatical items and linguistic/paralinguistic features.   
Step 3: understand how the situated meaning (Gee, 2005) the chosen item or the feature is invoked in its specific context.   
Step 4: infer the practices, goals, socially situated identities and social structures that orient the participants through the discourse in which this item occurs.

While the approach prioritises analysing the interaction itself, the plausibility of potential findings can be checked by iteratively referring to the other data sources (such as interviews with appropriate individuals).

The first step has already been discussed. The second step is located in the data words, clusters, turn-taking features, nonverbal behaviour and so forth, that may warrant further investigation. The central concept here is that there are linguistic items and features that play a critical, indexical (Ochs, 1996) role in terms of the interpretation and development of the discourse. That is, they have a situated meaning (Gee, 2005) which reflexively constitutes particular discursive, professional and/or social practices that represent widening degrees of the social context (also, see Bhatia, 2004, for a discussion of different levels of practices in written professional communication). For instance, in extract 1 the Japanese engineer asks about the oil. A practice-based interpretation of this is outlined here, with the arrow indicating the widening social context the further one moves from the localised text (Bhatia, 2004).

Social practice: Professional practice: Discursive practice: Text:

Managing projects   
Ensuring resources are used appropriately   
Checking   
No oil $^ +$ oil is empty?

The advantage of such an interpretation is that, through combining ethnographic insights with the recorded data, a greater understanding of the context is achievable than is the case with many applied linguistic approaches that tend to be limited to the text/functional (speech act) level.

To avoid the reductive pitfall of saying something is important merely because the researcher sees it as such (see Widdowson, 1998), language items and features can be classified as potentially of interest if:

- they are frequent,   
- they are statistically significant,   
- they are stylistically salient/culturally key,   
- they have been shown to be important in other, related studies.

The first two types of analysis of items can be conducted quantitatively using corpus software, whereas pinpointing th last two involves looking for predetermined items and features (Stubbs, 2001; Tribble, 2002), such as metaphors or tur organization (see Handford, 2010a). This paper is primarily concerned with quantitatively produced items.

Steps three and four move beyond quantitative and descriptive analysis, and involve interpreting the corpus data through reference to the multiple data sources collected during the course of the study, such as interviews with the participants and discussions with expert informants, as well as the extracts featuring the items. Evaluation of the data is the eventual goal, which can inform training of the inexperienced engineers as well as allow for a critical understanding of the context we have researched. As such, the analysis moves from description, to interpretation and finally towards evaluation, which Candlin asserts should be the aim of professional discourse analysis (Candlin, 2002).

# 2.4. Interpersonal discourse

This paper is concerned to a large extent with the interpersonal aspects of communication in international spoken discourse in the construction industry. While there was little evidence of small talk or off-topic relational communication between the Japanese staff and the other nationalities, even in transactional talk participants still ‘reinforce the relational context’ (McCarthy, 1998, p. 104) through interpersonal (Halliday, 1985) ‘choices’ at the clausal level such as pronouns. For example, they may use the inclusive we, rather than I or you, as well as employing non-verbal communication, such as smiling when discussing potentially face threatening issues (Brown & Levinson, 1987).

Iedema (1997), in discussing institutional discourse, argues that the study of the interpersonal register allows for an interpretation of social relations and their enactment through the dimensions of power and solidarity. While accepting Iedema’s cautioning against a categorical correlation between power and solidarity and particular linguistic tokens, it is plausible that certain interpersonal items and categories may reflect particular features of power and solidarity. Such an approach may enable us to infer the tacit practices that experienced members of such a community of practice (Wenger, 1998) use to interpret the communicative acts where such practices are invoked.

In applying the methodology discussed here to the whole of the CANBEC corpus of business meetings (and running keyword searches comparing CANBEC to SOCINT), Handford (2010a) finds that certain categories of items are far more typical of business meeting discourse than everyday English. Pronouns (specifically we), back channels (such as hmm and sure), vague language, hedges (such as I think) and deontic modality (for instance, need and have to, unlike must which is far more typical in everyday talk) are all statistically significant across a range of business contexts (including the speaker relationship, the company type and the nationality of speakers), and are therefore classified as potentially critical indexical categories. Handford proposes that these five interpersonal language categories invoke the following social (solidarity or power-related) dimensions and discursive practices in business meetings:

1. Pronouns: signalling the social relationship.   
2. Backchannels: signalling listener solidarity.   
3. Vague language: signalling solidarity over knowledge.   
4. Hedges: negotiating power over knowledge.   
5. Deontic modality: negotiating power over actions.

As we will see below, all of these categories and practices are also indexed in the HK data.

Handford (2010a) also argues that in problem-solving encounters, the statistically significant evaluative nouns problem and issue, the significant keyword $i f$ as well as metaphors are regularly apparent, constituting the discursive practices of focusing on decisions, speculating, and evaluating, respectively. While Handford’s (2010a) study is concerned with business meetings in companies, and is therefore from a different context than the construction industry, the findings provide an interesting point of comparison for the discussion of the construction data, as both sets of data are clearly occupational.

# 3. Results and discussion

This section is divided into four parts: the first two categorise and discuss the quantitative findings from the keyword and cluster searches, and the next two analyse the use of deontic modality, and deictic and non-verbal communication.

# 3.1. Keywords

The keyword comparisons between the HK data and SOCINT (and the HK data and CANBEC) produced noteworthy results, a selection of which will be highlighted and discussed. Firstly we will show several tables of keywords and clusters generated using the log likelihood ratio function in Wordsmith Tools (Scott, 1999). The keywords are defined as words that are significantly more frequent $p < 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 1 _ { . }$ ) in the HK data than in the reference corpora. The percentage of the total HK data each item accounts for is shown in brackets. For instance, need accounts for $0 . 5 1 \%$ , or just over one in every 200 words, in the HK data; this result is statistically significant in comparison to both the reference corpora (need accounts for $0 . 2 1 \%$ of all words in CANBEC, and $0 . 0 7 \%$ of all words in SOCINT). Table 1 shows a breakdown of a selection of the various items from the comparison between the HK data and the SOCINT corpus of social and intimate talk.

While several transactional ‘construction’ words were statistically significant, such as (boulder, shift, and slope), almost half the most significant items in the HK data were either interpersonal or discourse marking, for instance back channels (hmm, and hai) and the discourse marker so. Interestingly, several of the key items (hmm, okay, need, will, we, so, install) are also statistically significant in a separate keyword-based comparison between CANBEC and SOCINT (between everyday language and business meetings) in Handford’s extensive corpus-based study of business meeting discourse, 2010a. That is, some of the same words appear in business meetings and in HK on-site interactions. This is despite the fact that the speakers in the HK data all use English as an L2 (whereas speakers in SOCINT and to a lesser degree CANBEC are predominantly L1 users), and the type of profession is different (there is no engineering/construction discourse in CANBEC, and all communication in SOCINT is prosaic). As is discussed below, similarities were even more evident at the two- and three-word cluster level. One explanation is that the same discursive practices are being applied across separate institutional settings, and perhaps equivalent interpersonal concerns are addressed.

Table 1 HK vs. SOCINT interpersonal/textual keywords.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Back channels: hmm(1.26), yah(0.48), okay(1.07), hai(0.18) Modal verbs: cannot0.19), need(0.51), will(0.58)</td></tr><tr><td>Pronouns: we(2.57) Conjunctions: so(1.79), because(0.64)</td></tr><tr><td>Hedges, fillers: um(0.18), uh(0.16), eeh(0.14)</td></tr><tr><td>Markers: okay(1.07), alright(0.21)</td></tr><tr><td>Evaluative nouns: problem(0.18) Place deictics: this(2.55), here(1.18)</td></tr><tr><td>Action verbs: agree(0.08), discuss(0.06), remove(0.07), fill(0.13), measure(0.17), shift(0.3),</td></tr><tr><td>install(0.15)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 2 HK vs. CANBEC interpersonal/textual keywords.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Back channels: hmm(1.26), hai(0.18), okay(1.07), yes (0.52), yah(0.48)</td></tr><tr><td>Modal verbs: need(0.51), cannot(0.19), will(0.58) Pronouns: we(2.57)</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Conjunctions: so(1.79), because(0.64) Hedges, fillers: maybe(0.25), um(0.18), uh(0.16)</td></tr><tr><td>Markers: okay(1.07), alright(0.21), so(1.79), now(0.51)</td></tr><tr><td>Place deictics: this(2.55), here(1.18)</td></tr></table></body></html>

A second keyword comparison was conducted, comparing the CANBEC corpus and the HK data, and, as can be seen in Table 2, most of the same items occurred more frequently in the HK data than in the CANBEC business meeting data.

While the generalisability of these, and other findings, would benefit considerably from the collection of more data (the next stage of the project), the results raise the question of whether the interpersonal language used in the HK construction contexts is more prototypically ‘institutional’ than the referenced business meetings. As mentioned above, both will and need are two of the most frequent modal verbs in business meetings (Handford, 2010a), but here we find they are actually more typical in the HK data. The fact that we is ‘key’ in the HK data when compared to business meetings is also a very surprising finding, given that we is statistically the top keyword when business meetings and everyday talk are compared (Handford, 2010a). It is perhaps explicable by the fact that the recordees are all members of a joint venture, and may tactically be working towards a group identity; that is, they are signalling the social relationship. This is evidenced by the fact that we is overwhelmingly used inclusively in the HK data.

While there is considerable overlap between the keyword comparisons between on the one hand, CANBEC and SOCINT (that is, business meetings and everyday language), and on the other the HK data and both SOCINT (Table 1) and CANBEC (Table 2), one area of difference is the ‘keyness’ of the place deictics this and here. These are key in both lists (HK vs. SOCINT and HK vs. CANBEC), and will be explored further below in longer extracts, along with several other features from these lists. The appearance of the Japanese back channel hai is also interesting, given that it appeared repeatedly in data that was otherwise English.

Nouns are one of the main grammatical groups that tend to be produced by keyword comparisons (Scott, 1999), as they may reflect specialist knowledge in particular fields. Table 3 shows a breakdown of the various types of nouns that were also statistically significant in the corpus comparisons. While there is potential for overlap in the categorization in some cases (such as calculations, which could be a general occupation noun, but here it relates to the specific physical calculations conducted by engineers), results such as these should be of interest to trainee engineers who need to acquire different types of engineering knowledge and the relevant vocabulary.

# 3.2. Clusters

Clusters here are defined as reoccurring items of two or more words that may lack semantic or syntactic integrity (see McCarthy & Carter, 2002), but at least partly constitute certain discursive practices within a particular domain. For instance, in CANBEC, and then constitutes several discourse marking practices, such as enumerating (Handford, 2010a), as it does here. One of the most powerful insights from corpus linguistics concerns the ubiquity of multi-word units, or clusters, in various spoken genres (Greaves & Warren, 2010; Handford, 2010a; O’Keeffe et al., 2007). For instance, the four most frequent twoword clusters (this is, and then, this one and I think) account for over $2 \%$ of all words in the HK data (in CANBEC, the top four account for $1 . 2 \%$ of the total (see Handford, 2010a, pp. 125 and 126), but there is a higher density of longer clusters in CANBEC).

Recent findings on the prevalence of lexicogrammatical clusters in naturally-occurring language have far-reaching, and as yet not fully realized (Stubbs, 2007), implications for the syntagmatic and paradigmatic descriptions of language, and lend weight to Sinclair’s (1991) assertion that language is primarily formed in accordance with ‘the idiom principle’ as opposed to ‘the open-choice principle’, in that naturally-occurring language has a phraseological as opposed to a terminological tendency (1996, p. 82). For instance, the following complete turn by the Hong Kong engineer Tony (see below) Yeah it’s not a problem at all I mean it it’s just a record yeah can be broken down into the following very frequent business English clusters (Handford, 2010a), distinguishable as intonation units (Chafe, 1994), which are bookended by the regulatory turn opening and turn-closing yeah:

it’s not a problem at all I mean it it’s just a (record)

That such a tendency may also be evidenced in naturally occurring speech between L2 users of English who are nevertheless experts within their professional community of practice is of note, and requires further research (see Prodromou, 2008). One possible explanation is that, developing English L2 proficiency within a particular register is indicated by a shift towards a phraseological tendency. It was noticeable that the Hong Kong engineer quoted here had a far higher level of fluency in English compared to the Japanese engineers, which at least in part was illustrated by a more assured use of such clusters, as well as syntax. This was partly explicable by the fact that the engineer had worked in the UK as an engineer for over 10 years.

The lists of the most frequent 2, 3 and 4-word clusters in the HK data were analysed. Interestingly, several of the most frequent items in the HK data are also most frequent in the CANBEC corpus, and there was even greater similarity when the lists were analysed in terms of the discursive practices the items index. Table 4 shows the top ten most frequent two and three-word clusters from the HK data (with the least frequent, something like that, being one of many clusters that, once adjusted for corpus size, occurs slightly over 0.5 times per thousand words).

The four and five word lists are largely comprised of combinations of the shorter clusters. There were, however, some longer items that indexed decision-making and problem-solving practices, such as I agree with you and to make a decision and already agreed on the. While most of the clusters here are also among the most frequent in CANBEC (but not SOCINT, suggesting that these clusters signal professional discourse), one difference seems to be the lower frequency of longer clusters (5–7 words) in the HK data. One possible explanation is that longer clusters (such as but at the end of the day) tend to be used by very fluent speakers – hence we would find more in CANBEC, which is predominantly made up of L1 English users. Also, the small data set may be a factor. Table 5 categorises a collection of the most frequent clusters, and a high degree of overlap with the keyword lists is immediately evident.

In summary, these quantitative results highlight several categories of items that have also been pinpointed in other corpus-based studies of workplace discourse (Handford, 2010a; Koester, 2006), suggesting that equivalent discursive practices may be used across different professions. Next, deontic modality and deixis and non-verbal communication will be analysed. Deontic modality is explored here because the deontic modals need and have to were statistically important, and formed part of several frequent clusters, as do the certain deictic items. While deontic modality, used to signal obligation and necessity,

has been discussed in several other corpus-based studies of workplace discourse (Handford, 2010a, 2010b; Koester, 2006;   
McCarthy & Handford, 2004), the frequency of place deixis is perhaps more typical of construction-site discourse.

# 3.3. Deontic modality

Deontic modality is of critical importance in professional communication because it allows us to see one way that interlocutors negotiate power over actions. As argued by Handford (2010a), the English used in international work contexts by L2 English speakers may be more similar, especially at a lexical level, to that of L1 speakers than is often assumed, even by the participants themselves. Expert informants, citing the restricted language ability of the participants and the exigencies of the tasks, before the recordings opined that in construction interactions, must would be far more common than need to or have to, unlike business meetings (where must rarely occurs – Handford, 2010a); however, the opposite was found. It is worth mentioning, however, that there are many instances in the transcripts of syntactic formations that would be unusual in L1 settings, such as the highly frequent finite negative no need to in the discussion between the senior Hong Kong engineer (John), the Japanese engineer (Arai) and a Hong-Kongese junior engineer (Xu). Here the three engineers are discussing whether the next job’s location should be moved (shifted), and in what order the various tasks should be completed.

Extract 2: engineers deciding on the best plan of action.

1. Xu: You have to (be able to have a shift. . .)   
2. John: No we we we $^ +$ we (will add) one more pile (1) Is that what you mean?   
3. Arai: Err (1) We omit one number $^ +$ and then we can do we we will do the remedial work remedial work $^ +$ it’s already   
(so just 3 months) design   
4. John: /Yeah yeah yeah/   
5. Xu: /(In fact we do we do)/   
6. Arai: How ‘bout this case? We omit one number $^ +$ or shift? If shift and then we $^ +$ no need to do that (any more)?   
7. John: Right $^ +$ listen $^ +$ (east) the case is similar to this $^ +$ With the case similar $^ +$ they can adopt the same thing

The extract shows how the speakers negotiate what actions need to be carried out, and this is achieved through several modal forms such as have to, will, and can, as well as (no) need to. As we have seen, many of the significant interpersonal keywords and frequent clusters in the HK data are also significant in CANBEC, and the fact that certain items such as we, and need and have to are preferred to their more direct and face threatening semantic synonyms (you, and must), as well as hedging expressions like I think or I don’t know, suggests that face needs (Goffman, 1967) are a concern of the speakers, even though the interlocutors are operating in an L2, in an environment where safety is a crucial concern, and where noise levels can interfere with comprehension. Finally, the senior engineer brings the discussion to a close (turn 7) with the discourse marker Right and the apparent imperative listen. Interestingly, following the potentially face threatening imperative (perhaps used because John has to leave for the airport), he tones down the modality when outlining what the contractors should do: they can adopt the same thing (turn 7).

That the speakers also explicitly clarify each other’s meaning (No we we we $^ +$ we (will add) one more pile (1) Is that what you mean?) is also of note, and is a discursive practice observed elsewhere in the data and in CANBEC (Handford, 2010a).

# 3.4. Non-verbal communication, visual aids and deixis

The importance of deixis was an interesting finding, and was further supported by video recordings which show the participants constantly gesturing and thus clarifying meaning through combined verbal and physical deixis, (Levinson, 1983) for example, Photo 2.

Furthermore, the importance of skills such as the ability to take an appropriate photograph were signalled through interviews with senior engineers, and we observed a lot of explicatory drawing between engineers and foremen (see Photo 3), with the speakers again using a high degree of deictic language to clarify the explanations while drawing.

The visual skills necessary for becoming an expert engineer were not highlighted in other professional domains in the CANBEC corpus of business meetings, but similar findings have been reported among architects by Medway (1996). Furthermore, Sunaoshi’s study of interactions between Japanese technical supporters and American factory workers in a Japaneseowned factory in the US South also discusses the use of visual and gestural communication to achieve professional tasks (Sunaoshi, 2005). Thus, professional language-as-action that results in a physical outcome (as in a building, colour die materials, or a tunnel) seems to involve a high degree of such visual skills. Such skills may be particularly important in L2 lingua franca contexts characterized by high noise levels, a high level of shared professional knowledge, and a relatively less confident grasp of the language (when compared to the speakers’ L1s).

One area that was shared across business meetings in CANBEC and the HK data was the prevalence of problem-solving, signalled by the keywords and frequent clusters if, need, problem, make a decision, I agree with you, if you. Problem-solving is a core skill in any workplace, and in international construction interactions there is the added variable of culture. As noted in the methodology section, interviewees commented that Japanese and Hong Kong engineers can have very different expectations concerning the status and role of particular employees (with the Japanese apparently often approaching communication with a more hierarchically stratified mindset than the Hong-Kongese), meaning that decision-making can be fractious. Also, the extent to which the written contract dictates an individual or an organization’s responsibilities was cited as a potential area of conflict by several interviewees. Japanese companies often have minimal written contracts (because of a high degree of shared understanding in the domestic market), whereas in international construction projects the contract is expected to be as detailed as possible in order to clarify who is responsible and thus prevent lengthy, potentially conflictual negotiations. For new engineers coming from Japan, these differences and how they can impact on problem-solving and decision-making are of crucial importance. Finally, the importance of good relations between the different parties in a JV was raised by many interviewees, and training in how relationships can be affected at the language level (such as the use of need instead of must) and the more global level (by socializing together and developing tolerance towards cultural differences) would benefit the individuals and arguably their companies.

# 4. Conclusions

Several discursive patterns have been explored in this paper. The use of language and practices found in other professional contexts have been identified, as well as items, for instance, place deictics, that seem more specific to on-site engineering interactions. While there is much overlap with occupational L1 language use, as evidenced in Handford (2010a), both in terms of the language of power and solidarity (Iedema, 1997) the quantitative results and longer extracts also show much language that is syntactically constrained through the speakers’ English-proficiency level, especially on the part of the Japanese engineers. The Japanese engineers often appeared to provide the minimum response possible, with extended turns or off-topic contributions being rare, despite their relative seniority. In the interviews with several senior engineers in Hong Kong, the English level of young Japanese engineers was often raised as an area of concern, and was accepted as such by the company involved3 .

Indeed, some may comment that it is surprising that projects can be successfully managed without a higher English level. On this point, Du-Babcock and Babcock argue that professions, and the genres they employ, can be either word-dominated or symbol dominated (2007), citing lawyers as an example of the former, and engineers as the latter. They argue that in symbol dominated genres, the ability to encode and understand the symbols which carry meaning (such as diagrams and photographs) is more crucial to the effective exchange of information than error-free or incomplete language, as the meaning is conveyed by the symbols themselves (unlike word-dominated genres where precise and unambiguous language use is a prerequisite). This would certainly seem to be the case here, with information being successfully exchanged despite constrained English proficiency (for instance anomalous article use, word order, subject verb agreement, negation, tenses and ellipsis, as evidenced in the extracts). The use of diagrams, photos, gestures and a high level of shared engineering knowledge and practices thus enable the daily work to be successfully achieved.

This research has raised several questions concerning intercultural professional communication and relationships that have only been touched on here, and provide the basis for further exploration. The analysis of the recordings and the ethnographic data (particularly interviews with several engineers and our own observations) suggests that new and experienced engineers would benefit from training in problem-solving, relationship-building and communication.

By communication we mean not only English lexicogrammatical ability, but also the use of certain discursive practices, such as summarizing and tactical interrupting. As the extracts attest, clarifying meaning or location (extracts 2 and 3), discussing problems (extracts 1 and 2), and explaining processes (extract 4) are among several other discursive practices that seem particularly important. While these practices, which could be taught as skills, were not always evidenced through the most frequent clusters, a manual reading of the extracts brought to light their use, as in extract 1 when the Chinese junior engineer states Is that what you mean? and elsewhere the two word cluster you mean is used by participants to constitute the same practice. This highlights the importance of moving beyond quantitative research when dealing with corpus data.

One area of communication highlighted by the quantitative corpus results was the frequency of deictic language, allowing us to infer, through the iterative, mixed method approach taken here, that the competent use of non-verbal, gestural and visual communication is essential for on-site engineers. This even includes the ability to take an appropriate photograph, as previously mentioned.

As stated at the end of the previous section, various needs of trainee Japanese engineers, related to problem-solving, were noted during the interviews. At present we are developing and piloting training materials that focus on these needs. For instance, in seminars we have conducted discussions of certain critical incidents with our postgraduate students, giving them questions like:

‘‘Usually, the contracted companies that you have worked with in the past complete tasks such as moving equipment even though it is not in the contract. However, the contractors you have recently hired on this Hong Kong project have said that if you want equipment moved, then you have to pay them more.

What’s the problem/whose fault is this?’’

We will also be feeding back the results of our research to the construction company concerned, and will conduct training with their engineers.
