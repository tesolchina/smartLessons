# ABSTRACT

While the study of serious games has received due attention, few studies have investigated their potentials of simultaneously offering a route to both content and language acquisition. Understanding the interdisciplinary educational affordance of serious game play is significant, as it might provide game designers and teachers with insight into how to best design and implement serious games. In our study, the serious game Saving Lives was used to teach healthcare knowledge and English vocabulary to Iranian nursing students in an experimental group $( N = 8 0 )$ , while control group students were taught healthcare knowledge and English vocabulary using traditional methods $( N = 8 0 )$ ). Using a mixed-methods approach (pre- and post-tests, an open- and closed-ended questionnaire), intentional content learning, incidental vocabulary acquisition, and learners’ perceptions of digital game play were investigated. Results showed statistically significant improvement in participants’ healthcare knowledge and incidental vocabulary acquisition in the experimental group compared to the control group. Vocabulary and content knowledge gains in the experimental group were the result of students’ positive attitudes toward game play, the multimodal contextual clues provided during game play, and repetitive exposure to target words in the game instructions. Using serious games to integrate content and language teaching for specific purposes, such as nursing, was found to be both a viable option for teachers and a preferable medium for fostering students’ learning and engagement.

# 1.  Introduction

Digital games have become the media of choice for young people as they are engrossed in game play for hours a week (Sykes, 2018). As students are investing a great deal of their time in playing digital games, a sizeable number of researchers have seized this opportunity to investigate the potentials of digital games for learning (e.g., Chen & Hsu, 2020; Jensen, 2017; Reynolds, 2017; Sundqvist, 2019). A cursory look at the literature finds that researchers are focusing their investigations on a number of different fields and content areas, including literacy (Gee, 2007, 2009), history (Barab & Squire, 2004), biology (Clark et  al., 2009), foreign language (Cornillie et  al., 2012), among others. Digital games have especially caught the attention of applied linguists and language educators (e.g., Reinders & Wattana, 2015; Thorne et  al., 2012); the culmination of their research programs is the field of digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) (Reinhardt, 2019). Digital game scholars have recently drawn their attention to serious games. Serious games are designed for educational purposes, and “obey solid game design principles [such as just-intime instructions] but whose purpose is other than to entertain, for example, to educate or train” (Johnson et  al., 2005, p. 1).

According to the literature (Chen & Hsu, 2020; Zhonggen, 2018), serious games are fruitful for both language learning and content knowledge due to their affordances in offering an interactive, motivational context and multimodal learning. These affordances can help students to obtain the necessary skills to address both their language learning and content knowledge needs. While previous studies (Chen & Hsu, 2020; Johnson, 2007; Zhonggen, 2018) show that serious games can play a facilitative role in promoting content knowledge and can serve language learning purposes, this area of research is still in its infancy particularly with regard to essential content knowledge such as healthcare or emergency survival skills. To this end, this study examines the role of a serious game in teaching English and healthcare knowledge to Iranian nursing students. We embark on this study with the expectation that the results can (1) contribute to the better use of serious games in English for specific purposes contexts (Lin & Lan, 2015), (2) establish a better connection between game designers, students, and teachers in English classrooms for nursing students, and (3) give insights to policy makers and material developers about the use of serious games in classroom contexts. Thus, the goal of this study is to examine the impact of the serious game on the vocabulary and healthcare knowledge of Iranian nursing students. Also, this study examines the perception of Iranian nursing students regarding the use of the serious game for vocabulary and content knowledge learning.

# 2.  Serious games

Serious games are digital games that aim to offer educational content such as healthcare, history, advertising, and politics (Arriaga et  al., 2013). Serious games have traditionally been used in professional settings as a training platform in the military, aviation, medicine, and other sectors, because they simulate reality (Turner et  al., 2018). Later, they were incorporated in language learning settings, including language learning for specific purposes. An example is It’s a Deal!, a game used to teach English for business purposes and intercultural competence using realistic business scenarios (Guillén-Nieto & Aleson-Carbonell, 2012). Serious games have also been helpful for learning medical content (Zhongeen, 2019) or history-related vocabulary (Chen & Hsu, 2020). According to the literature (Boyle et  al., 2016; Chen & Hsu, 2020; Zheng et  al., 2015; Zhonggen, 2018), digital serious gameplay has a positive effect on vocabulary learning, because it provides opportunities for contextualized practice.

Various scholars (e.g., Ellis, 2002; Tomasello, 2003) have stressed the significance of contextualization and the quality of the social and linguistic environment of digital games as it relates to developmental trajectories. For instance, Ellis (2002) highlighted factors such as input frequency, linguistic complexity, and language-mediated opportunities for joint attention and meaningful engagement which all play a major role in the language learning process. Similarly, Reinhardt and Thorne (2020) acknowledge that one of the key language learning features of digital games in general and serious games in particular is the quality of contextualization and linguistic environments. Quality contextualization and linguistic environments positively impact L2 vocabulary processing. For example, Franciosi (2017) found gamers exposed to vocabulary while playing Energy City retained more vocabulary knowledge than participants taught vocabulary using a traditional method. Zhonggen (2018) stressed the relevance of contextualization and the linguistic environment by showing game players can enhance their vocabulary knowledge more than learners that learn through textbooks, drilling, and writing exercises. Zhonggen emphasized that the interactivity in the serious game was the driving force of the language acquisition. Similarly, Rabu and Talib (2017) reported serious gamers performed significantly better on productive form-meaning vocabulary knowledge assessments than their traditional instruction counterparts.

Consistently, scholars such as Sundqvist (2019) and Reinhardt (2017) as well of the results of numerous experimental studies (e.g., Abrams & Walsh, 2014; Chen & Hsu, 2020; Ranalli, 2008; Zheng et  al., 2015)

espouse that interactive digital games support language learning processes. The interaction within digital games stems from contextualized game mechanics that allow “the learner-player to associate form, meaning, and function through interaction with multimodal representations” (Reinhardt & Thorne, 2020, p. 416). In essence, effective contextual clues foster “deep learning” (Gee, 2009, p. 89), which is particularly important for comprehension (Rodgers & Webb, 2017). Likewise, the rich multimodal digital game contexts composed of static or moving images, texts, sounds, or their combination support “dual coding,” a process that increases the effectiveness of vocabulary acquisition (Clark & Paivio, 1991, p. 149). “Dual coding theory explains human behavior and experience in terms of dynamic associative processes that operate on a rich network of modality-specific verbal and nonverbal (or imagery) representations” (Clark & Paivio, 1991, p. 149). The “concreteness, imagery, and verbal associate process play major roles” in “the representation and comprehension of knowledge” and “effective instruction” (Clark & Paivio, 1991, p. 149). For example, multimodal contextual clues have been shown to improve receptive vocabulary learning (Khowaja & Salim, 2020). Support for the effect of dual coding has also been shown in studies such as Honarzad and Soyoof (2020) that compared vocabulary acquisition through the digital game play of Influent and the use of a mobile app AnkiApp: the dual coding environment of the digital game was found to be superior to that of the app, which resulted in more robust vocabulary learning.

While the affordance of gaming for vocabulary acquisition has become a recent focus of some incidental vocabulary acquisition studies (e.g., Chen & Hsu, 2020; Reynolds, 2017), the issue of frequency of exposure or the number of times a word is encountered in input has a long history (Laufer & Rozovski-Roitblat, 2011; Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2010; Pitts et  al., 1989; Reynolds & Wible, 2014; Rott, 1999; Webb, 2007). One could argue that most incidental vocabulary acquisition researchers would agree that the more encounters with a word the more likely the word will be acquired (e.g., Pigada & Schmitt, 2006; Reynolds et  al., 2020; Rodgers & Webb, 2020; Waring & Takaki, 2003; Webb, 2007); however, the incidental acquisition of vocabulary through digital gaming is likely to further enhance the salience of unknown vocabulary encountered through input in a way that raw frequency alone cannot explain (Chen & Hsu, 2020; Rankin et  al., 2006; Rodgers & Heidt, 2021). This is because players may not easily succumb to failure and may continue to play a digital game several times for entertainment in order to complete an in-game mission. Repeatedly playing a game will increase the exposure (i.e., frequency) to words and thereby increase salience. While this type of salience facilitation increases incidental vocabulary learning (Rodgers & Heidt, 2021), it is also likely that gaming aspects such as the multimodal context also leads to increased exposure and enhanced salience. For example, Zheng et  al. (2015) reported digital game players frequently communicated with each other about particular aspects of the game that led to incidental learning. Likewise, Sundqvist (2019) suggests that some in-game terminologies are made salient because of their connection to gaming graphics or a need for understanding to continue game play. While incidental vocabulary acquisition through gaming is likely to be affected by frequency, not unlike reading or listening alone, the dynamic and multimodal input provided by digital gaming is likely to affect incidental vocabulary acquisition in ways that the examination of raw frequency alone may not be able to uncover.

There is still a lack of studies that directly examine the role of serious game play for teaching English vocabulary for specific purposes in classroom contexts (Lin & Lan, 2015), and to the best of our knowledge, none have specifically addressed both content knowledge (i.e., healthcare knowledge) and language learning (i.e., vocabulary learning) for nursing students. This is an important next avenue for investigation as previous research (Boyle et  al., 2016; Chen & Hsu, 2020; Zheng et  al., 2015; Zhonggen, 2018) showed that digital gameplay has a positive effect on vocabulary learning, mainly because it provides opportunities for contextualized practice. So, it seems reasonable to assume that digital gameplay can also exert positive effects on vocabulary learning for language classes where content and vocabulary knowledge is essential to job-related skill development.

The current study involved the serious game Saving Lives, converging at the intersection of two disciplines: nursing and English language learning. While some serious games for learning language exist (Boyle et  al., 2016; Roccetti et  al., 2016), few of them were designed with learning language for specific purposes. The number specifically tailored to English for nursing purposes is limited. Given the centrality of English as a lingua franca in the medical field, exploring new avenues for future nurses and medics to learn English in contexts that are meaningful to them is more relevant than those encountered in games aimed at English learning for general purposes. A game such as Saving Lives has the potential of relaying domain-specific content along with providing contextualized learning of vocabulary. With these aims in mind, we investigated how game play resulted in gains of both domain-specific content and vocabulary knowledge. In addition, players’ perceptions of the potentials of the serious game for learning were also collected. Specifically, the study aimed to answer the following three research questions:

RQ1. How much vocabulary knowledge can nursing students acquire by playing Saving Lives?

RQ2. How much healthcare content knowledge can nursing students acquire by playing Saving Lives?

RQ3. What are students’ perceptions of Saving Lives?

# 3.  Methodology

# 3.1.  Participants

The participants of this study were 160 first-year 19 to 37 year-old ( $\scriptstyle { M = 2 1 }$ years) Iranian EFL university students (male $= 6 2$ ; female $= 9 8$ ) studying an undergraduate degree in nursing at a private university in Iran. At the time the study was conducted, the participants were enrolled in an English as a medium of instruction English for nursing module with the purpose of teaching nursing students specialized nursing English vocabulary and content knowledge. The participants’ English proficiency was A2 based upon the Common European Framework of Reference for Language (CEFR; Council of Europe, 2001) and they reported that their experience of playing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games (Sundqvist, 2019) ranged from 1 to 9 years $M = 2 . 5$ , $S D = 1 . 3 6 $ . COTS games refer to digital games which are “pleasure-oriented, in contrast to education-oriented games,” and are “played voluntarily by learners in their free time” (Sundqvist, 2019, p. 88).

# 3.2.  Instruments

# 3.2.1.  Game

The serious game Saving Lives, compatible with Android tablets and iOS iPads, was selected for the study (see Figure 1). Saving Lives was developed by academics at the App-Clinic group (https://www.app-clinic. com/) with copyright held by Adtalem Global Education. Saving Lives won the 2018 gold award for serious play events (https://seriousplayconf. com/2018-award-winners/). The purpose of the game is to familiarize players with the necessary skills and equipment required for using a first aid kit and administering life support; the game also familiarizes players with some specialized equipment commonly used by paramedics and nurses. The medical content knowledge follows the guidelines of the American Heart Association (e.g., chest compression). Saving Lives provides contextualized content knowledge and specialized vocabulary training congruent to the curricular needs of the nursing degree pursued by the participants in the study. Generally speaking, Iran is open to incorporating digital technologies into nursing modules (Motallebzadeh et  al., 2011) as this specialized contextual learning has been shown to be important for the teaching of healthcare knowledge (Dubovi et  al., 2017; Duke et  al., 2017; Guise et  al., 2012).

Figure 1. A screenshot of Saving Lives.

Saving Lives scaffolds each phase of life support with corresponding specialized vocabulary and content knowledge training. The game features audio recordings which could potentially help to promote players’ English listening skills. Players are asked to fulfill different healthcare tasks which requires the review of vocabulary sets. For instance, players should interact with the touch screen in order to apply the proper rate of chest compression for a patient (see Figure 2). If the rate of compression is too quick, the game will instruct the player to decrease the rate of compression. Another example is of a task where players are requested to initiate shock if the patient does not respond to the chest compression (see Figure 3). If players are unable to fulfill game tasks within a predefined period of time, they fail and must repeat the level. To accomplish the tasks, players must have acquired both content and language knowledge.

# 3.2.2.  Productive knowledge vocabulary test

The study followed a pre-/posttest design by administering the same 80-item productive knowledge vocabulary test before and after game play requiring participants to provide a Persian translation or definition of targeted lexical items encountered during game play (see Appendix A). The productive knowledge vocabulary test was constructed by seeking assistance from three English language teaching experts who had extensive experience in the field of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and knowledge of the field of incidental vocabulary learning. Items on the pre-/posttest were in a different order. Since the participants in the study were not aware that they were going to be assessed on vocabulary knowledge, any knowledge acquired through game play was considered to have occurred incidentally to completion of the game tasks (Hulstijn, 2001).

Frequency of occurrence of the target words were calculated by counting the tokens of the target words that appeared in the same form (Reynolds & Wible, 2014). There is no consensus among scholars over the number of exposures required before vocabulary acquisition occurs. While some studies have proposed six to eight exposures sufficient for acquisition (Bisson et  al., 2013; Horst & Meara, 1999; Rott, 1999; Waring & Takaki, 2003), others have suggested more than ten times may be required (Pigada & Schmitt, 2006). It should be noted that the majority of this literature has focused on the incidental acquisition of vocabulary through reading (Reynolds & Wible, 2014) and the results through multimodal game play are likely to yield different outcomes. Regardless, reoccurrence of words is deemed as the most important factor resulting in learned words being retained over time (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001; Rodgers & Webb, 2011; Teng, 2018). According to Laufer and

Rozovski-Roitblat (2011), repeated exposure to new words, involving their linguistic and pragmatic properties, can help language learners to sharpen their memory of the words. For the current study, players were exposed to new words in contextualized situations in which they were asked to perform a medical procedure. As we aimed to sample target words from all levels of the game, this resulted in the necessity of selecting target words exhibiting different frequencies of exposure. However, systematic randomized sampling was used to sample target words from the first ten levels of the game. Using the instruction text of the game, the targeted lexical items were randomly sampled across three frequency bands according to their occurrence in the game: high (6 or more occurrences); mid (2 to 5 occurrences); and low (1 occurrence).

# 3.2.3.  Healthcare knowledge test

The same 10-item multiple choice healthcare knowledge test was administered before and after game play (see Appendix B). Items on the pre-/ posttest were in a different order. The healthcare test was constructed by three university professors of nursing based upon the content of the serious game. To ensure the content validity of the test, three additional university professors of nursing familiar with Saving Lives were asked to give comments that were used for revision of the items. The test was then piloted with fifteen students from the same population as the participants recruited for the formal study. As the Cronbach alpha internal consistency was found to be at an acceptable level $\left( a \mathrm { = } . 7 5 6 \right)$ and the pilot participants did not report any misunderstandings regarding the items, no further adjustments were made.

# 3.2.4.  Perception survey

A 17-item (13 five-level Likert scale items and 4 open-ended questions) survey was designed to collect participants’ perceptions towards the use of the serious game in learning nursing content and EFL (see Table 8 and Appendix C). The survey was developed partially based on Chen and Hsu (2020) that surveyed participants’ use of a serious game for history learning. Since the content knowledge of the game was healthcare knowledge, three healthcare experts were recruited to construct the healthcare content items. The items concerning English learning were adopted from Chen and Hsu (2020).

# 3.3.  Procedure

Prior to data collection, a consent form containing general information about the purpose of the study (implications, confidentiality, anonymity, rights of participants) were given to the participants and the teacher. After the participants and the teacher signed the consent forms and returned them to the researchers, data collection started. The researchers ensured the anonymity of the participants by using pseudonyms, and the confidential data was safely kept in a password-secured computer.

English classes were held once a week for 2-hour sessions. The topics of the lessons involved Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and basic life support skills such as using Automated External Defibrillator (AED), and the proper procedures for administering chest compressions. Before the participants played the serious game for the first time, they were given the pre-tests (i.e., the first session). Using a quasi-experimental design, the two classes of students were randomly assigned as an experimental and control group. While the 80 participants in the experimental group were taught healthcare and vocabulary knowledge using a serious game (i.e., Saving Lives), the other 80 participants in the control group were taught healthcare and vocabulary knowledge using traditional techniques (i.e., using whiteboards and a leaflet with a teacher’s instruction). The detailed explanation of what happened in each group during each session is provided in Table 1. Participants in both the control and experimental groups could exchange information, use their bilingual dictionaries, and accordingly took notes as they completed activities. The teacher kept track of participants of both groups to ensure they had equal learning opportunities to use bilingual dictionaries, and exchange information. The researchers selected the levels of the serious games and designed texts in sessions 2 to 5, to ensure that participants in both groups had equal opportunities to be exposed to the targeted words mostly in terms of frequency and to the corresponding healthcare knowledge. In this way, the researchers used identical texts extracted out of the serious game for both the control and the experimental groups. Also, the students in both the control and experimental groups engaged in identical activities. The researchers also ensured that participants in both the experimental and control groups followed the same methodology and stages of instruction (see Table 1) provided by the same teacher. The only difference between the participants in the control and experimental group was the medium of instruction. The participants in the experimental group accessed content and instruction through the serious game on their tablets and a projection of the serious game. The participants in the experimental group accessed the content and instruction through leaflets and a whiteboard. Table 1 details how the researchers controlled any potential intervening variables.

The experimental group participants played the game in the second to fifth sessions until they completed ten levels. During game play, the experimental group participants were encouraged to take notes on content knowledge. If students encountered any difficulties, the teacher was available for assistance. For example, when the participants did not understand the purpose of a given level or game instruction, the teacher elaborated on the purpose of the task and if needed scaffolded the participants to understand the English in order to continue the game play. In the sixth session, the participants were administered unexpected posttests followed by the perception survey. The procedures were largely based on Chen and Hsu (2020) and are illustrated in Figure 4.

# 3.4.  The quantitative data analysis

SPSS 23 was used to run a number of statistical analyses on the data collected for this study. Explanations about the use of the different statistical tests and how they were used to answer the research questions are provided in the relevant sections below.

# 3.5.  The qualitative data analysis

Answers to the open-ended questions in the survey (i.e., items 14 to 17) were analyzed thematically using NVivo 10. Thematic analysis was applied to the data to locate patterns (i.e., themes) regarding the participants’ perceptions of the game (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Thematic analysis requires six analytical steps: familiarization with the data, generation of initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining/naming themes, and report production (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The coding process of the semi-structured interview transcripts was completed by three experts in the field of educational video games and language learning. The inter-code reliability (agreement between coders) was $9 6 \%$ . More importantly, the Cohen’s kappa coefficient was .873 which is an acceptable and substantial agreement level (Landis & Koch, 1977).

# 4.1.  Vocabulary acquisition outcomes

Prior to conducting any statistical analyses, preliminary checks of the data ensured that there was no violation of assumptions including normality, linearity, homogeneity of variances, and regression slopes. An independent sample $t$ -test was conducted on the productive knowledge vocabulary pre-test scores to investigate for any significant differences between the two groups. The results showed no significant difference, $t _ { ( 1 5 8 ) } { = } { - } 1 . 5 4$ , $p { = } . 1 2 7$ , between the control $M = 2 6 . 8 7$ , $S D = 1 . 4 8 { \it \Psi }$ ) and the experimental $M = 2 6 . 1 8$ , $S D = 3 . 7 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) groups. The posttest results are reported in Table 2.

Subsequently, taking the productive knowledge vocabulary pretest scores as a covariate, a two-way ANCOVA was conducted to investigate for a statistically significant difference between the control and experimental group’s productive knowledge vocabulary posttest scores (see Table 3). A significant interaction between group and posttest scores by frequency was found, $F _ { ( 2 , 1 5 3 ) } { = } 1 5 . 1 0$ , $\textstyle p < . 0 0 0 0 5$ , partial eta squared $\mathsf { l } { = } . 1 6 5$ . A significant difference, $F _ { ( 2 , 1 5 3 ) } { = } 1 1 . 6 5$ , $ { p } < . 0 0 0 0 5$ , was also found for frequency (i.e., high, mid, and low) and group, $F _ { ( 2 , 1 5 3 ) } { = } 1 1 . 6 5$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 0 0 5$ . These results indicate that after taking into consideration the participants’ scores on the pretest, the experimental group showed statistically significant higher outcomes on the productive knowledge vocabulary posttest. Furthermore, the participants’ scores on the productive knowledge vocabulary posttest were affected by the frequency of occurrence of the vocabulary assessed in the posttest.

To understand the effect frequency had on the experimental group’s vocabulary acquisition outcomes, further analyses were run. First, the results of a paired sample $t$ -test indicated a significant difference $( t _ { ( 8 0 ) } = -$ 26.75, $\scriptstyle p < . 0 0 1 .$ ) between pre- $M = 2 6 . 1 8$ , $S D { = } 3 . 7 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and post-test $\mathit { \Delta } M = 4 9 . 8 1$ , $S D { = } 6 . 9 7 ,$ ) scores, yielding a large effect $\left( d { = } 0 . 9 0 \right)$ of game play on vocabulary acquisition. Next, three additional paired sample $t$ -tests, one for each of the vocabulary frequency levels, further showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and posttest scores (see Table 4). The most salient vocabulary development can be seen among the participants’ exposure to high-frequency vocabulary with the highest effect size value and gain score (see Table 4). Lastly, a one-way ANOVA run on the experimental group’s posttest scores found a significant effect of frequency $[ F _ { ( 2 , 7 7 ) } { = } 1 6 . 9 7 _ { ! }$ , $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 1 }$ . Scheffe post hoc comparisons showed the participants acquired high frequency words $\mathit { M } = 5 7 . 1 3$ , $S D = 5 . 6 4 _ { . }$ ) significantly $\left( \scriptstyle p < . 0 0 1 \right)$ more than mid frequency $M = 4 9 . 1 7$ , $S D = 5 . 8 5$ ) and low frequency words $\mathit { \Delta } M = 4 5 . 3 8$ , $S D = 6 . 1 5 ) $ . In addition, medium frequency vocabulary was acquired significantly more than low frequency vocabulary.

To understand the effect frequency had on the control group’s vocabulary acquisition outcomes also required $t$ -test analyses. The results of a paired sample $t { \cdot }$ -test showed a significant difference $t _ { ( 8 0 ) } { = } { - } 1 0 . 4 1$ , $p { < } . 0 1 )$ between pre- $( M = 2 6 . 8 7$ , $S D = 1 . 4 8$ ) and post-test $\mathit { \Omega } ^ { \prime } M = 3 1 . 8 8$ , $S D = 4 . 3 1$ ) scores, yielding a large effect $\left( d \mathrm { = } . 5 7 \right)$ of traditional instruction on overall vocabulary acquisition. Subsequently, three additional paired sample $t { \cdot }$ -tests, one for each of the vocabulary frequency levels, further showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and posttest scores (see Table 5). The most noticeable vocabulary development was seen in the participants’ learning of low-frequency vocabulary with the results showing the largest gains resulting in a large effect size (see Table 5). Next, a one-way ANOVA run on the control group’s posttest scores by frequency found no significant effect for frequency $[ F _ { ( 2 , 7 7 ) } { = } 0 . 3 8 3$ , $\scriptstyle { p = . 6 8 } ]$ .

# 4.2.  The results of the healthcare knowledge

Prior to conducting any statistical analyses, preliminary checks of the data ensured that there was no violation of assumptions including normality, linearity, homogeneity of variances, and regression slopes. An independent sample $t { \cdot }$ -test was conducted on the health knowledge pre-test scores to investigate for any significant differences between the two groups. The results showed no significant difference, $t _ { ( 1 5 8 ) } { = } { - } 5 3 9$ , $p { = } . 5 9 1$ , between the control $\mathrm { \Delta } M = 3 . 3 6$ , $S D = 1 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ ) and the experimental ( $\stackrel { \cdot } { M } = 3 . 2 7$ , $S D = 1 . 0 4 \mathrm { \Omega }$ groups’ pretest scores (see Table 6).

To understand the effect traditional instruction had on the control group’s increase in healthcare knowledge, a further analysis was run. The results of a paired sample $t \cdot$ -test did not show a significant difference $\stackrel { \prime } { t } _ { ( 7 9 ) } = - 0 . 5 2$ , $p { = } . 5 9 )$ ) between pre- $\stackrel { \prime } { M } = 3 . 3 6$ , $S D = 1 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ ) and post-test ( $\overset { \cdot } { M } = 3 . 4 2$ , $S D { = } 1 . 0 9 _ { \cdot }$ ) healthcare knowledge scores, yielding a small effect ( $\stackrel { \cdot } { d } = 0 . 0 1 2 )$ ) of traditional instruction on healthcare knowledge (see Table 6). Likewise, to understand the effect the serious game had on the experimental group’s increase in healthcare knowledge, a further analysis was run. The results of a paired sample $t { \cdot }$ -test showed a significant difference $\stackrel { \prime } { t } _ { ( 7 9 ) } = - 1 9 . 9 5$ , $p { < } . 0 1 \rangle$ ) between pre- $\mathbf { \zeta } M = 3 . 2 7$ , $S D = 1 . 0 4 ,$ and post-test $( M = 6 . 0 6$ , $S D = 1 . 2 5 )$ ) healthcare knowledge scores, yielding a large effect $\stackrel { \prime } { d } = 0 . 8 3 ,$ ) of serious game play on healthcare knowledge (see Table 6).

A one-way between-groups analysis of covariance was conducted to compare the participant groups’ healthcare knowledge post-test scores (see Table 7) using their healthcare knowledge pre-test scores as the covariate. A significant interaction effect between posttest scores and group was shown, $F _ { ( 1 , 1 5 7 ) } { = } 2 5 8 . 7 4$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 0 0 5$ , indicating that group had a large effect on posttest outcomes after the pretest results had been considered (partial eta squared $\lvert = . 6 2 2 \rvert$ ). The results suggest that there was a significant difference between the two groups’ healthcare knowledge posttest scores.

# 4.3.  Likert scale items analysis

An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the responses to the closed-ended Likert scale items to uncover participants’ perceptions of Saving Lives for learning EFL and healthcare knowledge. Principal axis factor analysis was utilized as the extraction technique and Promax as the rotation method. The loadings of the Likert scale items were calculated, showing none to have a loading below 0.40 (Hair et  al., 1998). Subsequently, the data for items which had a minimum eigenvalue of 1 were suitable for further analysis. The reliability of the items was calculated using Cronbach’s Alpha $\scriptstyle ( a = . 7 9 0 )$ .

The EFA resulted in the extraction of three factors: “Language Learning” (i.e., items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 13), “Game Design” (i.e., items

Full information on experimental participants’ responses to the items can be found in Table 8 and results of the factor analysis are illustrated in Figure 5. In Figure 5, the percentages represent the degree to which the participants agreed (i.e., answering strongly agree or agree) to the Likert scale items extracted as the three factors. For example, $9 3 . 9 \%$ of participants agreed or strongly agreed to items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 13 (i.e., Language Learning) while the remaining $6 . 1 \%$ of participants strongly disagreed, disagreed, or had no opinion.

The three extracted factors are described below:

1. Language learning: This factor generally refers to the language related features of Saving Lives. For instance, whether Saving Lives contributed to vocabulary acquisition or the reading and listening comprehension improvements.   
2. Game design: This factor mainly describes to what extent Saving Lives as a serious was successful in addressing the educational needs of the students. For example, whether the game was at the appropriate difficulty level.   
3. Healthcare Knowledge Attainment: This factor mainly refers to the processes of acquiring healthcare content knowledge offered through playing Saving Lives. Specifically, it referred to whether the game helped the students develop healthcare knowledge.

# 4.4.  Open-ended question analysis

Four themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) language learning through serious game play, (2) cognitive factors affecting learning, (3) suitability of simulation and video games for healthcare training, and (4) meaningful learning of healthcare knowledge through game play.

# 4.4.1.  Language learning through serious game play

The participants reported playing Saving Lives allowed them to learn useful language on two levels; vocabulary development and listening. Regarding vocabulary, the students learned words and phrases, and most of the time, they could recall their meaning due to game-afforded contextualization. Student 3’s reflections were representative of most participants:

If I encounter new vocabulary words several times, I can better learn the meaning of those vocabulary words. The serious game played a crucial role in helping me recall new vocabulary words. [Student 3, Quote 72]

It was always very challenging for me to understand the meaning of ‘first-aidkit.’ Now I know it refers to a small box containing essential medical items. As I accomplished each mission in the game, I saw the picture of a ‘first-aid-kit,’ and I was supposed to use different items in it to keep the patient alive. After playing the game for several times, I understood that the first step was to use the ‘first-aid-kit’ to keep the patients alive until other procedures can be done at hospitals. [Student 3, Quote 36]

![](img/b1fad3db445dd0ce5e0b592d6e50d96137da9e45039785c5b86cc40344ce4104.jpg)  
Figure 5. E xtracted factors: language learning, game design, and healthcare knowledge attainment.

However, some participants also stated that the meaning of some new vocabulary could not be inferred through gameplay which required them to seek out scaffolding assistance from the teacher. This could be considered as one specific limitation of Saving Lives and a general limitation of COTS games. One student explained this issue:

Sometimes when playing the game, I had some questions. I had to ask for help from the teacher who solved my problems with further explanation about the new words. [Student 14, Quote 25]

Serious games designed specifically for language learning purposes provide digital glossaries or clickable pop-up explanatory definitions and/or L1 translations that increase the potential of incidental vocabulary learning on-the-fly during game play (Lenders, 2008). If this feature is not added to a serious game, the teacher can either provide scaffolding when needed, or teach additional skills to ensure the game can be used for its intended educational purpose (Molin, 2017). This may require training teachers with specific knowledge on how to implement games in classrooms and associated digital literacies to prevent these pitfalls (Alyaz & Genc, 2016; Becker, 2007; Blume, 2020). Regarding this expanding notion of digital literacies beyond the actual use of games, there is the critical use of language technologies like Google Translate and others, which might have empowered students in our study to grasp unknown words and phrases while playing the game by themselves (Reynolds, 2017; Reinhardt & Thorne, 2019).

In relation to listening, participants also stated that after listening to an American accent, they learned the pronunciation of new vocabulary, and could differentiate between British and American pronunciation, improving their appreciation for sociolectal and geographical varieties of English.

While playing the game, I closely listened to how words were being pronounced. Then I checked whether there were differences between American and British pronunciations in a dictionary. [Student 10, Quote 18]

Future studies may also look at how language and content learning develop in relation to in-game participation and engagement. Saving Lives seemed to provide a multimodally stimulating environment to some of the learners:

As I was playing the game, I knew what actions were required because of the sounds the patients made, the images of patients, and through the written instructions. [Student 13, Quote 40]

The multimodal aspects of the game helped sustain the idea of learning through multimodality (Kress, 2013), which is not exclusively bound to plain text, but includes sounds, pictures, gestures, and other meaning-making modes. Such features in Saving Lives attracted student attention. The students could interact with various healthcare related equipment in the game context. Through the reading of these interactive explanations and the manipulation of the digital equipment, the students could obtain an in situ understanding of how to use different healthcare equipment. Then if needed, the teacher was always available to further aid their understanding.

# 4.4.2.  Cognitive factors affecting learning

The participants reported that playing Saving Lives resulted in a reduction of stress due to the entertainment afforded by the game. Researchers have claimed video game play can reduce stress while simultaneously promoting learning (e.g., Rama et  al., 2012; Reinders & Wattana, 2011, 2015). The quotes below exemplify how students perceived less or no stress while they kept entertained when learning. Although this results was gained from interviews, it shows significant promise for delineating the use of games (serious and COTS) and gameful education (Reinhardt, 2019).

In the context of the game, I was free from any stress. I prefer to learn through playing games. When I am learning in a stress-free context, I can learn more efficiently. [Student 7, Quote 12]

The game was full of fun and not dull. I lost track of time when playing. I not only enjoyed playing the game but also learned language and healthcare knowledge. The game context was very motivating. I like improving my English knowledge by playing games. [Student 5, Quote 64]

# 4.4.3.  Suitability of simulation and video games for healthcare training

Most ( $N = 6 2$ , $7 7 . 5 \%$ ) participants asserted that through game play they achieved a solid understanding of how to use healthcare equipment and how to keep patients alive. They also stated that they came to a clear understanding about first aid through game play and that this was a better learning experience than reading a leaflet. This extended to knowledge about protocols of action, reaction time, identifying symptoms, and applying appropriate treatment. One student shared:

The instructions in this game were professional and written by real healthcare academics. The details about how to use each tool and the different steps required were identical to real-life experiences. [Student 4, Quote 17]

Simulated healthcare environments offer many of the same learning opportunities as real-life experiences. Other non-language studies also found digital simulation a practical, safe alternative to face-to-face healthcare education (Khan et  al., 2011; Motola et  al., 2013). In the words of Cooke-Plagwitz (2008, p. 547), simulations encourage “purposeful educational inquiries.” In addition, our findings suggested the learners were extremely engaged because of the learning affordances (just-in-time instructions, requirement to stay on task, precision) provided by the game:

The meaning of ‘precise action’ and ‘quick reaction’ could be intimately felt during the game, and there is a clear deadline to accomplish each task. As the time passes, you can see different reactions from the patients and understand quick action is necessary to save lives. [Student 9, Quote 43]

Patients’ illness and the related symptoms can be detected more clearly through games and simulations than through reading in books. Game players can obtain a better understanding of symptoms and the related treatment for a disease. [Student 17, Quote 75]

# 4.4.4.  Meaningful learning of healthcare knowledge through game play

Most participants $( N { = } 6 7 , 8 3 . 7 \% )$ found Saving Lives a challenging context that provided precise instructions on a range of skills nursing students should acquire. These positive perceptions support claims made for the potential of video games for training students in nursing and healthcare; serious games also have the potential of developing healthcare practitioners without liabilities of errors and their related costs (Graafland et  al., 2012). For example, one student shared:

I learned about cardiogenic shock through playing the game. Not everyone that has a heart attack has cardiogenic shock. I know that if the patient is rapidly breathing and they have a sudden rapid heartbeat the body can’t pump enough blood. [Student 6, Quote 12]

# 5.  Discussion

RQ1. How much vocabulary knowledge can nursing students acquire by playing Saving Lives?   
The experimental group was able to increase vocabulary knowledge by an average of $7 0 . 8 7 \%$ compared to the control group’s $1 5 . 3 2 \%$ increase. The results showed that the participants were able to gain new word knowledge through playing Saving Lives, supporting the results of previous studies on incidental vocabulary acquisition through game play (e.g., Chen & Hsu, 2020). Some researchers (Abrams & Walsh, 2014; Ranalli, 2008; Zheng et  al., 2015) have claimed that the rich contextual clues aided by multimedia annotations result in higher levels of incidental vocabulary learning through gaming than what occurs through reading. Vocabulary encountered through book reading can only provide learners exposure to their linguistic forms (i.e., spelling), while vocabulary encountered through game play exposes learners to “multimedia annotations” (Chun & Plass, 1996, p. 183) in which learners are presented with sound and visual representations of words. Rich contextual clues can result in “deep learning” or deep processing of newly encountered words (Gee, 2009, p. 89). This may cause learners’ attention to be drawn to new words, something that may not necessarily happen in reading. It could have been the combination of meaningful context (Horst & Meara, 1999; Webb, 2007) heightened with the addition of multimedia annotations (Chen & Hsu, 2020) that led to these significant gains in lexical knowledge during game play. The results of the current study support the results of previous studies (Chen & Hsu, 2020; Honarzad & Soyoof, 2020; Zhonggen, 2018) that found serious games more helpful than traditional methods for vocabulary acquisition due to their interactive and motivational contexts. While traditional instruction can result in vocabulary learning, several reasons can still be provided for why the participants in the control group on average acquired only around 5-6 words after 4 weeks. Firstly, the control group did not have the advantage of learning new words in an interactive, motivational, or multimodal context. There is a high probability that they forgot a number of the targeted words. Secondly, many of the targeted words were specialized for nursing and could be challenging to acquire without offering real-life or close to real-life contextualized learning. As an example, Rogers and Webb (2017) found that when comprehension is most difficult, multimodal learning such as captioning can play a crucial role to help students acquire new words. Similarly, Sundqvist (2019) stressed the role of interactive context in digital games can lead to better acquisition of new words, particularly difficult words. Thirdly, in this study, the researchers used a productive knowledge test which is more challenging than receptive knowledge tests that might be more sensitive

to register lower levels of learning. Fourthly, the control group could have acquired other words that were not measured by the productive vocabulary knowledge test. Finally, the targeted words were selected based on the frequency of occurrence in the serious game and not the frequency of occurrence in the materials used in the traditional methods.

This study supports the findings of Boyle et  al. (2016) who showed that serious games can foster vocabulary learning in different fields such as science, mathematics, technology, health related subfields, and culture (Roccetti et  al., 2016). Taken together, serious game play was found to be facilitative in promoting words being used for specific purposes. However, the results of the current investigation also suggest that there was a trend of more higher frequency words being acquired than mid or low frequency words. Based on previous research, about five exposures to a target word can significantly contribute to incidental acquisition of a previously unknown word (Bisson et  al., 2013; Chen & Hsu, 2020; Huyen & Nga, 2003; Teng, 2018; Webb, 2007). As word acquisition is considered as an incremental process (Nagy & Scott, 2000), it is not surprising to find that the higher the frequency of exposure, the higher the gains in vocabulary knowledge. However, if one wishes for substantial gains in vocabulary to occur through game play, probably more than six exposures will be needed to ensure retention (Chen & Hsu, 2020; Rankin et  al., 2008).

Given the benefits of digital games for acquiring new words compared to reading (Janebi Enayat & Haghighatpasand, 2019), teachers may consider using serious games inside or outside the classroom as a supplementary tool to language focused teaching. However, teachers should be aware that if they wish for their learners to experience most of the game play outside the classroom, they may still need to initially guide students in the class as the participants that played Saving Lives sought the advice from the teacher from time to time to continue game play. Practitioners should choose digital games in general and serious digital games in particular that offer richer contextual clues to improve students’ vocabulary knowledge. The importance of rich contextual clues is underscored by dual coding theory (Clark & Paivio, 1991; Nation, 2013). Additionally, Rodgers and Webb (2017) and Webb (2007) stressed the importance of rich contextual clues to facilitate the process of vocabulary learning. Contextualized language learning is key, not only because it ameliorates comprehension but also because it renders language learning meaningful to the shared cognitive framings of students and teachers. Contextualized language learning renders language practice truly communicative as it can serve a real purpose. Studies and reviews on informal language learning (Reinhardt & Thorne, 2020; Soyoof et  al., 2021) have underscored how important communicative contexts are for language users to gradually learn languages autonomously in a self-directed manner through game play, engagement in social media, and associated CALL practices. We believe serious games and other digital games are one of many good fits for enhanced contextual language practice, which is particularly true when hands-on experience and specialized targeted vocabulary are combined.

# RQ2. How much healthcare content knowledge can nursing students enhance by playing Saving Lives?

Based on the results from the healthcare knowledge test, the experimental group showed an average gain in 2.79 items compared to the control group’s 0.06 item gain. The findings of this study are in line with previous studies showing content knowledge can be increased through game play (Charlier et  al., 2015; de Ribaupierre et  al., 2014). Johnson (2007) and Chen and Hsu (2020) asserted that good serious games can do more than provide an enjoyable way to spend one’s leisure time; if serious games are carefully selected, they can enhance content knowledge. Results such as those found in the current study come about when there is a good connection between pedagogical content knowledge and game development (Linderoth & Sjöblom, 2019). If the game is targeted for a relevant group of learners such as the nursing students in the current study, game play motivation is likely to lead to sizeable gains in content knowledge (Beavis, 2017). Additionally, the results showed that the participants in the control group could not significantly improve their healthcare knowledge with the traditional instruction. This result could be due to the nature of the test (i.e., distractors in the multiple tests or getting score by chance in the pretest) (Currie & Chiramanee, 2010). More likely it was that the participants in the control group learned additional healthcare knowledge not measured by the healthcare knowledge test; the healthcare knowledge test was constructed based on the contents of the game.

# RQ3. What are students’ perceptions of Saving Lives?

In this section, the participants’ perceptions of the game are discussed. First the results of the closed-ended Likert scale items of the perception survey are reported and discussed before the results and discussion of the open-ended questions. A dominant quantitative design was used to first analyze the participants’ responses to the closed-ended section of the perception survey followed by qualitative analysis of the open-ended section. This process aimed to build on and support the findings gained from the quantitative analysis (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). EFA of the responses to the closed-ended questionnaire items allowed extraction of three factors to explain students’ perceptions towards the use of Saving Lives for learning: Language Learning, Game Design, and Healthcare Knowledge Attainment. Furthermore, thematic analysis of the responses to the open-ended questions uncovered four qualitative themes that supported the quantitative findings: (1) language learning through serious game play, (2) cognitive factors affecting learning, (3) suitability of simulation and video games for healthcare training, and (4) meaningful learning of healthcare knowledge through game play.

The items that composed the first factor (i.e., Language Learning) were related to the features of Saving Lives which enhanced language learning. This factor supports previous studies (e.g., Chen & Hsu, 2020; Dehghanzadeh et  al., 2019) that found playing serious games developed language in general and vocabulary in particular. Seventy-five $( 9 3 . 9 \% )$ of the participants believed that playing Saving Lives helped to enhance their language, particularly vocabulary, listening, and reading skills. Frequently occurring words helped participants recall their meanings (i.e., item 7). The repeated occurrences of the targeted words throughout the game enabled the learners to master their productive knowledge (Webb, 2007) as well as promote reading ability (Nagy & Scott, 2000).

The second factor (i.e., Game Design) contained items related to the desirable elements of Saving Lives, including the game context. This factor supports previous studies (e.g., Beavis, 2017; Chen & Hsu, 2020) which emphasize the significance of serious game design. More participants $( 9 5 . 6 \% )$ gave positive responses to the items that constituted the second factor (i.e., Game Design) than the items that constituted the other factors. Linderoth and Sjöblom (2019) and Zhonggen (2018) suggested that serious games that address the educational needs of the players should be prioritized as this could encourage an improvement in academic performance while also improving students’ mood (i.e., Item 1). In a parallel vein, Beavis (2017) emphasizes the significance of attractive elements (i.e., Item 2) in well-designed serious games, claiming that such elements increase the amount of interactivity during game play and accordingly enhance students’ learning outcomes.

The third factor (i.e., Healthcare Knowledge Attainment) contained items that explored the extent to which the participants found Saving Lives suitable for promoting content knowledge. This factor shares similarities with the results of several previous studies (e.g., Chen & Hsu, 2020; Johnson, 2007; Linderoth & Sjöblom, 2019) which highlighted the importance of content knowledge in serious games. While this factor received the least positive responses by the participants, it was still relatively high $( 9 2 . 9 \% )$ , indicating that Saving Lives was helpful in increasing the players’ healthcare knowledge.

# 6.  Limitations and future research

While the serious game was found helpful in increasing students’ healthcare and English vocabulary knowledge, this study was not free from limitations. First, a delayed post-test could have been administered to measure participants’ vocabulary retention and not just learning after game play; unfortunately, as data collection occurred within a classroom and the study was incorporated into the instruction that the learners received, it was difficult to gain access to the participants for data collection after their course had ended. Second, the frequency of occurrence for target vocabulary was operationalized as the number times the target words appeared in the written game instructions rather than the total frequency of exposure to the vocabulary through game play. Thus, the learners may have been repeatedly exposed to the targeted words if they repeated any in-game levels. A future study may be able to address this limitation through screen recording and manual calculations of frequency of exposure for individual learners. Third, Schmitt (2010) maintains that a single evaluation of lexical knowledge cannot provide researchers a solid grasp of the overall lexical knowledge of individuals as vocabulary knowledge is a complex multi-faceted construct. Hence, to better capture a wider range of the lexical knowledge of the target words, if possible, multiple assessments should be administered (Schmitt, 2010). However, the productive knowledge translation test was a more reliable indicator of word knowledge that has been acquired by the nursing students. We argue that the context of healthcare with the risks that come along with patient treatment necessitates showing proficiency in targeted vocabulary to make claims regarding the suitability of a game for learning. However, future studies could supplement translation tests to further allow for assessing partial knowledge that could be strengthened by future game play. Lastly, these results are limited to the Iranian EFL context for highly motivated nursing students. A different game played by the current participants or participants from a different educational background playing the same Saving Lives game may yield disparate learning outcomes.

For instance, without the game, the participants in the control group learned a limited number of words and less content knowledge. This may be due to teaching methodologies normally used at Iranian universities (e.g., teacher-centered instruction, less student participation). In our study, the change in the medium of instruction did result in improved vocabulary and content learning for the experimental group. Medium can therefore positively affect learning, by offering contextualized learning and motivational boost. We acknowledge, however, that attention must be directed at teaching methodologies and philosophical underpinnings, without which only changes on the surface of (language) education are possible. Another limitation in our study is that the participants and the teacher only agreed to collaborate with the researchers for six sessions. Future studies can be designed that plan for a larger number of instructional sessions and a larger number of targeted words while also investigating for other word-related variables (e.g., saliency, cognate status).

# 7.  Conclusion

The participants’ healthcare content and vocabulary knowledge increased because of game play. Words that occurred more frequently in the in-game instructions resulted in better vocabulary acquisition outcomes. The participants also reported several positive experiences in playing the game that resulted in content and vocabulary knowledge gains. While game play was found useful to the participants, they still relied on their teacher for scaffolding during game play. The growth and popularity of video games requires researchers, game developers, and teachers to continue to consider how digital games can complement the learning that is already taking place in and outside educational contexts. As language learning cannot be separated from content learning, we anticipate future gaming titles targeting other subject areas that will allow further content and language integrated learning through digital gaming.
