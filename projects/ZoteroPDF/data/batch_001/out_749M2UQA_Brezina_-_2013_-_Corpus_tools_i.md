In the Journal of English for Academic Purposes (12,3) Mark Davies critically reviews my article (Brezina, 2012a), in which I propose the use of Google Scholar (GS) in EAP research and pedagogy, and shows the advantages of using the academic subcorpus of the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA-academic). Davies points out that in COCA-academic, there is a larger number of occurrences of reporting patterns than I report in Table 4 of my article (p. 324). This is undoubtedly true. However, it is important to note that in my study I searched for different patterns than Davies does in his replication of the study. For example, while Davies’ searches include patterns of the type as Johnson points out, mine include patterns of the type as Ellis (1999) points out [with reference to a year of publication]. As far as the modifications of the reporting patterns are concerned, I searched for patterns of the type as Ellis (1999) rightly POINTS OUT [with one specific reporting verb], Davies for patterns as Billing rightly ANY VERB [with any possible reporting verbs]. In addition, the searches I was reporting on were based on an 86-million-word version of COCA-academic rather than on the more recent 91-million-word version. So the comparison between the results in the two papers is not straightforward.

In addition, in my study, I was primarily looking at disciplinary conventions and distribution of reporting patterns in different academic fields rather than the occurrence of the reporting patterns in the whole academic subcorpus. In the main study based on GS searches, I analyse the use of reporting patterns in two disciplines, Applied Linguistics and Physics. The study shows strong disciplinary preferences in terms of 1) the format of the citations and 2) preference for different reporting verbs. Such findings, in my opinion, have important implications for EAP pedagogy and cannot be, as Davies (2013: 164) also notes, replicated in a straightforward manner with COCA-academic.

Davies’ article also raises a number of more general questions related to the use of corpus resources in EAP. My personal view of corpus linguistics is an instrumental one: Corpora are tools which can be successfully used both in research and pedagogy (cf. McEnery & Hardie, 2012; Reppen, 2010; Flowerdew, 2009), but their usability depends on particular research questions, teaching/learning contexts and learner needs. We therefore cannot assume that “one tool fits all”. As the readers can see, in my original article (Brezina, 2012a) I did not argue for replacing traditional corpora with Google Scholar searches. Instead, I proposed that in EAP, we should be creative in using different corpus resources available. In the article, I explored the simple GS search interface (the use of which in some contexts can indeed be an advantage) and the power of the search syntax as well as the limitations of GS searches. Based on my experience with teaching EAP courses in a number of different contexts, I can say that GS can be used effectively in EAP pedagogy. In addition, as I propose elsewhere (see Brezina, 2012b for a classroom study and examples of teaching materials), with the GS approach students can be instructed to carry out simple searches, while the instructors can download GS data and share the results of more complex analyses with students as part of the feedback.

We also should not forget that every corpus is not only a tool but also a sample of language. Despite its limitations when used as a linguistic search engine, Google Scholar offers an insight into a range of linguistic practices (reflected in a variety of text types/genres sampled) in a number of disciplines. This, in my view, is a feature that can be usefully explored in EAP research and pedagogy.
