# ABSTRACT

As a corpus-assisted method for language pedagogy, DDL (data-driven learning) may have the potential to enhance language exposure and promote active learner engagement. Concordancing, or KWIC (Key Words in Context), has been the traditional method used in DDL to retrieve numerous language examples, while the method has limitations with overreliance on individual words to search. This paper aims to propose and promote concordancing alternatively based on grammar patterns, a multi-word concept in corpus linguistics. The conceptualised method is named as PIC (Patterns in Context), an extended form of KWIC. An empirical study was conducted to investigate whether the PIC method has any advantages over the traditional KWIC method, using two custom-built Android apps. The research involved 18 pre-university intermediate learners (and six pilot study participants), who used the apps in a self-directed way for two weeks. Then the assessment of the two apps and methods was conducted based on data from automatic logs and responses from questionnaires and interviews. The results suggest that, compared to KWIC, PIC could be slightly advantageous in efficiently helping learners find the target language use, while this approach seems not strong in user engagement and perceived effectiveness. The implications for DDL are discussed, and further investigation is also planned.

# Introduction

A corpus often consists of a large body of natural texts, capable of providing rich information of language use and abundant examples for teachers and learners. Since the turn of this century, there has been a growing “convergence” (Leech, 1997) of corpus linguistics with language teaching and learning (Bennett, 2010; Flowerdew, 2012a; Gavioli & Aston, 2001; O’Keeffe et  al., 2007; Timmis, 2015). It is noted that such convergence between corpora (the plural form of ‘corpus’) and language education can be achieved both indirectly and directly (Romer, 2008). The indirect use of corpora in language education, i.e., developing dictionaries and reference books based on or influenced by corpus resources and research results, has been well established (McCarthy, 2008). Examples include Collins dictionaries (Sinclair, 1987) and Touchstone textbooks (McCarthy, 2010), and more can be found in Leńko-Szymańska and Boulton (2015). However, the approach of using corpora directly in language pedagogy, i.e., presenting learners with ‘raw’ search results, seems much less developed (Chambers, 2005; Mukherjee, 2004; Romer, 2011). The latter strand was pioneered by Johns (1991, 1994), who coined the terms ‘DDL (data-driven learning)’ to illustrate the practice. Briefly, DDL can be seen as a discovery process in which learners take part in ‘hands-on’ learning of concordances, i.e., a list of examples containing the target word retrieved from a corpus. Although this approach is acknowledged to have great potential for language learning, it is yet to be widely used by teachers and learners (Boulton, 2009, 2017; Flowerdew, 2012a; Saeedakhtar et  al., 2020). A number of barriers to the widespread application of DDL have been identified, including technical obstacles, as well as pedagogical and attitudinal hindrances. Details are set out in the subsection “Problems of DDL and proposed solutions” in the literature review. The major problem with DDL, at the cost of oversimplification, is perhaps the dauntingly complex process of searching and learning. We believe that the phraseological concept ‘grammar pattern’ from corpus linguistics and user-friendly mobile technology may be synergised to bridge the gap between DDL and learners at large. In this research, we propose a method, Patterns in Context (PIC), which features concordancing of multi-word patterns, instead of individual words as in the traditional method - Key Words in Context (KWIC). This paper reports an experiment to investigate whether PIC can offer any advantages over KWIC for academic English learning. Two Android apps, functioning as concordancers of individual words and structured patterns respectively, were specially developed for the experiment. The research involved two cohorts of intermediate ESL learners, who practised PIC and KWIC concordancing apps separately on mobile tablets. The participants’ behaviour, comments and reflections may help shed light on how to promote DDL in a wider range of language classrooms.

The potential value of this preliminary experiment on PIC/KWIC comparison may be largely methodological: following the pragmatist approach, this research drew upon multidisciplinary knowledge and mixed methods to find a solution. For one thing, programming for app development was utilised to stage the PIC/KWIC comparison on the mobile platform, which may be a step closer to more learners; for another, passively-captured logs were incorporated to reinforce answers from questionnaires and interviews, so that data in this mobile learning research were not confined to merely users’ self-reporting. Although the comparison turned out to be inconclusive at last, the research process has demonstrated the endeavour to address increasingly sophisticated problems, resorting to all means from concepts to techniques. It may also point to new avenues of research on the vigorously studied areas of corpus linguistics and mobile learning.

# Literature review

# Potential benefits of DDL

The approach of DDL was described as “the use in the classroom of computer generated concordances to get students to explore the regularities of patterning in the target language, and the development of activities and exercises based on concordance output” (Johns & King, 1991, p. iii). In his seminal paper to introduce DDL, Johns (1991) invited learners to find the similarities and differences between convince and persuade via observing a number of concordance lines, i.e. a list of aligned examples with the target word in the middle1 (p. 16):

As shown above, concordances are a list of all of the occurrences of a particular search term (also called ‘node word’) in a corpus, presented within the context in which they occur – usually a few words to the left and right of the search term (Baker et  al., 2006, pp. 42-43). Although the sentences tend to be truncated or incomplete, the context-embedded examples in a large number may inspire learners to observe and notice language use. The examples serve as the ‘data’, while learners are ‘driven’ to learn target forms of word use through observation. Learners are expected to find answers themselves as “linguistic researchers” or “language detectives” (Johns, 1997).

Great language exposure and active learner engagement seem to be the among the major affordances of DDL. In the first place, abundant concordance lines can provide an intensified and condensed exposure to real language (Gabrielatos, 2005), delivering “enhanced and enriched input” (Ellis, 2012, p. 285) on request to learners. Secondly, learner engagement advocated in DDL is considered to concur with the central principles of constructivism and socio-cultural theory (Flowerdew, 2012b, 2015). Since learners are encouraged to solve problems by hands-on observation, reflection and discussion, the DDL design seems to be in line with the constructivist tenant of ‘learning by doing’. This process may also help enhance ‘learner agency’, in which learners are trained to be more independent, autonomous and self-regulated (Larsen-Freeman et  al., 2021). The author would quote Boulton (2011, p. 575) below to show the potential compatibility of DDL with a range of well-established pedagogical principles:

The eclectic and non-dogmatic nature of DDL (by whatever name) is fully compatible with communicative language teaching; discovery learning and learning by doing; autonomisation and learning to learn; learner-centredness and individualization; collaborative learning and creativity; task-based and process as well as product orientations; form and meaning in constructivism; with an emphasis on the authentic language of discourse by register/genre.

The results from empirical studies over the past two decades tend to be supportive. Numerous studies have reported that, DDL can help learning vocabulary and grammar (Celik & Keser, 2010; Cobb, 1997, 1999; Geluso & Yamaguchi, 2014; Gilquin, 2020; Guan, 2013; Karras, 2016; Lin & Lee, 2015, 2017; Liu, 2010, 2011; Liu & Jiang, 2009). Recent meta-analyses on existing DDL studies (Boulton & Cobb, 2017; Cobb & Boulton, 2015; Lee et  al., 2019) have also confirmed the pedagogical contribution of DDL for learners from various linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

# Problems of DDL and proposed solutions

In spite of the pedagogical benefits acknowledged and proved, DDL has been largely excluded from mainstream teaching practice. It is noted that “although various educational uses of concordancing are frequently talked about, they are not so frequently tested with real learners” (Johns et  al., 2008, p. 494). The situation does not improve significantly in the following years despite more attention to and interest in the affordances of DDL (Boulton, 2009, 2017; Flowerdew, 2012a; Saeedakhtar et  al., 2020; Vyatkina, 2016). Much literature has discussed the barriers to its broader application, and comprehensive reviews have been completed by Boulton (2009) and Chambers (2010). The barriers can be categorised into three types: technical, pedagogical and attitudinal.

Technically, there seem to be a lack of proper tools for learners (cf. Romer, 2008; Tyne, 2012). Existing concordancers are reported to be overly complicated or developed only for certain corpus projects (Flowerdew, 2012a). In addition, appropriate texts to search through are often unavailable. The unfiltered and unprocessed texts taken from general corpora may not be ready and appropriate to use as learning materials due to concerns about size, specialty and linguistic difficulty (Flowerdew, 1996, p. 98). To address it, there have been proposals to build ‘pedagogic corpora’ (Willis, 2011) or to conduct ‘pedagogical processing’, i.e., tailoring texts to less proficient learners (Braun, 2005, 2007).

The major pedagogical problem lies in that DDL involves primarily an inductive rather than deductive approach, featuring bottom-up rather than top-down processing of text (Flowerdew, 2009). Apparently, analysing corpus data may be laborious and even tedious for many learners (Chambers, 2007; Cheng et  al., 2003), who may probably feel helpless and discouraged when confronted with scores of or even hundreds of concordance lines. In this case, DDL may become rather time-consuming and less productive in teaching and learning practice. To address the problem, one suggestion is to conduct deductive instructions before inductive activities to enhance confidence and motivation (Liu & Jiang, 2009).

The major attitudinal barrier might be that DDL cannot fit in the traditional teacher-centred classroom. As Boulton (2009) points out: on the one hand, “teachers are reluctant to make themselves psychologically if not literally redundant”; on the other hand, many students may “prefer to be told what to do, accepting that it is the teacher’s role as expert to show them, and resent having to take any responsibility for their own learning” (p. 93). It seems that neither sides are well-prepared for the learner-centred, self-directed, research-like learning style as DDL promotes.

Among many measures to address such technical, pedagogical and attitudinal problems, one emerging proposal to promote ‘mobile DDL’ (Pérez-Paredes et  al., 2019), i.e., presenting concordances directly to leaners through special mobile apps, may be promising. It is believed that the new mobile platform may help alleviate at least some of the technical and attitudinal problems with DDL. Firstly, the past decade has witnessed a rising number of language learning apps penetrate into the daily life of learners (Gangaiamaran, 2017; Godwin-Jones, 2011; Klímová, 2017). Designing and developing a learner-friendly mobile concordancer may not be a big challenge. Secondly, highly portable mobile devices offers highly personalised learning experience with more flexibility and freedom in time, space and other aspects (Kearneya et  al., 2012; Kukulska-Hulme, 2009; Kukulska-Hulme & Shield, 2008). The new learning style may help both sides of learners and teachers to embrace a new mindset of their roles in education. Mobile learners, on the one hand, are able, and maybe sometimes obliged, to monitor and control their own pace and progress; they can initiate, structure and direct their own learning in a way they feel comfortable with. Teachers, on the other hand, are found to be willing to adapt to the new format as a supporter and facilitator in the mobile learning settings (Smith et  al., 2016).

Mobile learning is believed to hold great promise for learning support (Traxler & Vosloo, 2014). As illustrated above, the integration of mobile learning practice may naturally address the concerns on tools and mindset, and learners and educators may benefit from mobile DDL technically and attitudinally. For the pedagogical concern of inductive text analysis, it is hoped that introducing grammar patterns, an extended unit of concordancing at the interface of vocabulary and grammar, might help alleviate the demanding tasks of direct corpora consultation in DDL. The concept of ‘grammar pattern’ is elaborated in the next section.

# Grammar patterns

Grammar pattern is a concept originating from corpus linguistics. Hunston and Francis (2000, p. 37) define it as “all the words and structures which are regularly associated with the word and which contribute to its meaning”. To illustrate the concept, concordancing examples of three afraid-related structural patterns are also provided2 (Hunston & Francis, 2000, p. 48):

It can be seen that patterns contain elements of both vocabulary and grammar at the phraseological interface between them. One the one hand, they are largely lexical as “a description of the behaviour of a lexical item, or one of the behaviours of that item … to describe everything about the phraseology of a word” (Hunston & Francis, 2000, p. 247). On the other hand, “a pattern can be used to identify the recurring grammatical behaviour of individual lexical items, and that these behaviours can be represented as grammar patterns” (Hunston, 2001, p. 31). In other words, patterns are neither individual words nor abstract grammatical structures, but a combination of lexis and grammar. As a phraseological account of language, patterns share ground in common with other linguistic notions stressing the intrinsic connection between vocabulary and grammar, such as collocation/colligation (Baker et  al., 2006), construction (Goldberg, 2006), chunks (Ellis, 2003), prefabricated language (Ding, 2018) and formulaic language (Wray, 2002, 2008).

In fact, grammar patterns seem to be the expected learning gains in DDL, since learners are encouraged to “explore the regularities of patterning” (Johns & King, 1991, p. iii). Partington (1998) also believes that patterns can be made more apparent in concordances. Nevertheless, non-expert learners may still find it challenging to notice, identify and categorise patterns when wading through numerous concordance lines. This difficulty has been evidenced in some empirical research (e.g. Huang, 2014). To address the challenge, one proposed solution is to integrate grammar patterns in DDL (cf. Romer, 2008; Willis, 2003), because patterns, at the interface of grammatical structures and lexical items, may help students learn pre-set forms of language use from abundant examples of specific words. However, empirical attempts to implement and study pattern-based DDL seems to be scant in the academia. Therefore, a new concordancing method, Patterns in Context (PIC), is proposed and tested in this research on the mobile platform. More elaboration is set out below.

# Patterns in context (PIC): a partially deductive method of concordancing

PIC is designed to achieve clearer presentation and easier awareness of grammar patterns in DDL. PIC is a proposed concordancing method derived from KWIC. Unlike KWIC, which deals with individual words, PIC retrieves patterns of a word with a focus on grammatical construction of its collocations. The most significant difference may be that PIC allows for different word combinations, especially noun phrases, while it clings to on the same target structure in concordance results. For example, ‘leave $^ +$ something/somebody $^ +$ ADJ.’ is a useful structure with the node word leave (e.g., leave me alone, don’t leave your belongings unattended). As the specific noun phrase in the middle and the following adjective may vary, it is difficult to observe this pattern out of many other usages in KWIC. Figure 1 is the screenshot to show part of the concordancing results of leave from an online KWIC concordancer3 .

![](img/21966184382d71b54c94459604b4cbf31f60c384bc52453aef7044bd25b4575e.jpg)  
Figure 1. S earch results of leave from an online KWIC concordancer.

It can be seen that the two examples of the special usage are nearly drown in hundreds of KWIC concordances. Without special highlighting, learners may feel it a torture to do the ‘discovery’ all by themselves. By contrast, PIC can accurately retrieve and present all ‘to-the-point’ instances of the pattern, as shown in the following results:

constituent part of society) [leaves it susceptible] to criticism from psychologists who found Nora ‘s decision to [leave her family insupportable], perhaps did not appreciate I information recorded logically [leaving the information fragmented] and dislocated. but even hive pests were [leaving these colonies alone] ./Now bees have periodically

In the PIC research results above, the grammar construction is underlined with diversified word combinations, because all the retrieved examples fall into the same pattern: ‘leave $^ +$ noun phrase $^ +$ ADJ.’ In PIC-based concordancing, the patterns of a word are set out beforehand, and learners are guided to focus on one observable word use (‘pattern’) rather than struggling with various usages at a time. Thus, compared to entirely inductive KWIC search, PIC is partially deductive in the pedagogical term, which is expected to save time and effort.

Technically, PIC results are extracted from POS (part of speech)-tagged texts using regular expressions. A regular expression (‘regex’ for short) is a sequence of characters that forms a search node to match a string of characters. The accuracy of PIC concordancing cannot be achieved in KWIC by adopting wildcard symbols (‘\*’ in particular). For example, the string $^ { \mathfrak { c } } d o ^ { * }$ can match do, doing, don’t and does, but the irregular form did is excluded in the same search, while many more irrelevant results of down, dock, doctor and so on are included in the concordances.

# Three dimensions of PIC/KWIC comparison

In this research, the comparison between PIC and KWIC is designed to be around three dimensions: learner engagement, efficiency and perceived effectiveness. The implementation of assessment is modified from conventional practice for language education, taking into consideration the characteristics of mobile learning. It is noted that evaluation has been a major problem for mobile learning (Pachler, 2009; Sharples, 2009; Vavoula & Sharples, 2011). The learning process may spread across different locations and time periods, and it is always difficult to monitor and observe learners’ behaviour on the mobile platform out of the traditional classroom. Due to the various variables in mobile learning contexts, it is difficult to check and attribute learning outcomes to a certain factor via more convincing methods, like pre- and post-tests and so on. Most mobile learning studies, unsurprisingly, have to base on subjective comments from teachers and/or self-evaluations by students (Burston, 2015; Traxler & Kukulska-Hulme, 2006).

Therefore, the assessment of PIC takes new methods combined with conventional ones. Firstly, engagement is among the popular research topics from traditional to digital educational contexts (Martin et  al., 2020; Salta et  al., 2021). In regard to the typology of ‘engagement’, there have been several models of two, three or four subtypes with different terms (Reschly & Christenson, 2012). This research would adopt the four-subtype classification by O’Donnell and Reschly (2020): academic, behavioural, cognitive and affective. The focus of this research is on behavioural engagement, mainly the participation into learning activities. Therefore, among the engagement detection methods in digital settings (see Figure 2), automatic log-file analysis is employed as the major tool to assess engagement: the more words or patterns users search in the apps, the more behaviourally engaged they seem to be. Self-reporting may also provide supportive information. Secondly, automatic logging can also help assess efficiency, because the time spent on word/pattern searching is recorded in logs: presumably, the less time spent, the more efficient the method might be. Thirdly, the assessment of perceived effectiveness has to rely on participants’ responses from questionnaires, interviews and focus groups, since more objective indicators of learning effect tend to be unavailable in the context of mobile learning.

# Methodology

This section starts with detailed explanation of the concordancing app design. It also includes the research question and hypotheses, followed by details on data collection methods and procedure of the research.

# Details of the self-developed apps

Despite the existence of desktop-computer-based and web-based concordancers (e.g., AntConc, Lextutor), so far there has not been a mobile concordancer to present numerous examples on request, to our knowledge. In addition, it seems that there is no learner-oriented pattern-based concordancing tool currently (there might be collocation finders like Linggle.com, but it is not a truly pattern concordancer). As mentioned above, PIC concordancing can be conducted in POS-tagged corpora via regex. However, the process seems dauntingly complex for non-expert users. For example, to search a simple pattern of noun phrase (e.g., a good boy), a possible string of regex can be like this: $\backslash \mathrm { S + \_ J J } \backslash \mathrm { w } \ref { A 2 : H 0 } \backslash \mathrm { - } \mathrm { N } \backslash$ $\mathbf { w } + \backslash s ) ? \backslash s \backslash \mathfrak { b } ( \mathrm { N o d e } ) \_ { \mathrm { N N } \backslash \mathbf { w } ^ { * } \backslash s }$ (‘Node’ here refers to the headword to search). It is challenging for learners to formulate the string, not to mention that POS-tagged corpora are often unavailable to them. Therefore, the mobile PIC concordancer in this research should enable users to click to retrieve word-associated patterns without any knowledge on the computational linguistic pre-processing.

Following the above guideline, two Android apps, featuring concordancing of individual words and multi-word patterns respectively, were specially developed to test PIC in comparison with KWIC on the mobile platform. The two apps deliver PIC and KWIC results directly to learners on request. They are named as AKWIC (academic key words in context) and APIC (academic patterns in context), as they are pre-loaded with texts of academic English as a reference source for the learning of academic English.

Firstly, the corpus to search is pre-loaded, so that users do not have to prepare texts themselves. The texts, taken from the academic sub-corpus of COCA (Corpus of Contemporary American English), amount to nine million words in size over nine disciplines. In addition, 50 core academic verbs, the top ones from the most recent frequency-based Academic Vocabulary List (Gardner & Davies, 2014), are provided as the pre-set search words. Correspondingly, the patterns associated with the 50 core verbs are provided in an expandable list on the interface. AKWIC users can choose a word to search at a time, and APIC users should take an additional step to choose one pattern before moving to the next interface of PIC concordancing. Figure 3 shows the two patterns attached to the search word provide.

Secondly, ten random concordances are presented at a time rather than being displayed in whole. Users can press the search button (a detective icon and a ‘look up more’ button in AKWIC and APIC respectively) to retrieve another ten concordances. This design can free the users from being inundated in too many examples while maintaining great language exposure on request. The target word, all inflections included, is always highlighted in yellow between a pair of brackets right in the middle, as shown in Figure 4. In the case of APIC, what is highlighted in yellow between brackets is the selected pattern, as shown in Figure 5.

# Research question and hypotheses

The present research aims to investigate this question:

Does the PIC approach offer any advantage over traditional KWIC to ESL (English as a second language) students as a learning reference of academic English?

Derived from the above research question, three hypotheses are worded as null hypotheses as H1 to H3 in the following:

Engagement in this hypothesis will be measured mainly by considering the number of queries made, particularly distinct queries. This is based on the assumption that if a participant tries more queries, they feel the method more useful and would continue to engage with it. Answers to the survey questions may also be considered for the assessment of user engagement.

H2. There is no difference in the efficiency of helping learners induce the target word use between PIC and KWIC.

Efficiency will be measured predominately by checking the time taken to complete a query. This is based on the assumption that a more efficient presentation of retrieved examples will result in less time spent on understanding a particular language use. This assumption may make sense because it is observed that mobile learners tend to exit a dictionary app immediately they obtain the query answer. The participants in this research were told to exit the PIC/KWIC app once they felt they had induced the language use out of the presented examples.

H3. There is no difference in perceived effectiveness between PIC and KWIC.

This hypothesis will be tested by considering the participant responses to the questionnaire and the focus-group interview at the end of each period of app use.

If all results turn out to be in favour of either approach, we can reach a clear response to the research question: PIC has (no) distinct advantage over KWIC in helping ESL students with their learning of academic English. If not, then PIC has no significant advantage over KWIC.

# Data collection methods

Following a convergent parallel mixed methods approach (Creswell, 2014), this research collected both quantitative and qualitative data from multiple methods. The collected data were corroborated and triangulated later in analysis and discussion. Three tools were employed for data collection:

Firstly, data of app use were recorded in a .TXT file via automatic logging, an effective way to collect quantitative data, which is often scant in mobile learning research (Trinder et  al., 2009). Figure 6 shows a fragment of automatic logs. Once the user presses certain buttons on the interface, corresponding information is recorded automatically: time and date of each login and logout, words searched by the user, and so on. Based on the logs, descriptive statistics on the app use can be worked out. A ‘session’ refers to each period between a user’s activation and their later exit of the app (between a pair of LOGIN and LOGOUT), indicating how many times the app was used in total. A ‘distinct query’ is a non-repetitive attempt to inquire about a different word, calculated by the total number of queries less repetitions of the same word search. For example, include and provide are distinct queries in the session.

Figure 6. A fragment of automatic logs of app use.

Secondly, the participants completed an online questionnaire at the end of the course. The subjects were also invited to the final semi-structured interview, the third method of data collection, in the forms of one-to-one interviews or focus groups. The conversations were digitally recorded and transcribed later. After member checking, the agreed transcripts were put into NVivo for coding of qualitative data. The pre-determined coding scheme consists of two themes: attitude and content. Two codes: [positive] and [negative], are put under ‘attitude’; ‘content’ consists of five tags: [experience], [functionality], [interface], [method] and [suggestion], to anchor user’s comments on different aspects of the approaches. The inserted codes helped retrieve users’ views to triangulate the data from automatic logging and questionnaire answers.

# Participants and research procedure

This research targeted intermediate English learners. For ethical considerations, the participants’ private mobile devices were not used to install the apps. Instead, they were loaned an entry-level 7-inch Samsung tablet with the apps pre-loaded. The participants kept the tablets for autonomous and self-directed use for two weeks, i.e., there were no tasks or assignments for the participants, who might choose to use the app all at their discretion as mobile learners. After that, the participants returned the devices to the authors for data collection. All together there were nine tablets available for research. Six undergraduates of a university located in Auckland, New Zealand, participated in the pilot study to test whether the data collection methods could work well. Following this, a total of 18 pre-university ESL learners were recruited in two rounds in the main study on a voluntary basis upon granting of Ethics Approval from AUTEC (AUTEC 14/174). The participating students, mainly from Asian and Middle East countries to New Zealand, were attending a pathway programme to college study in a language school affiliated with the same university. In terms of language proficiency, they were mostly intermediate learners. Each cohort of nine participants were given five tablets with APIC and four devices with AKWIC. Hence, there were altogether 10 APIC users and 8 AKWIC users, who were not informed of the other app for their peers.

Finally, all the pilot study participants had the interview individually, and seven of the main study participants (almost $4 0 \%$ ) formed three focus-groups (2 participants $^ { \mathrm { ~ + ~ } 3 + 2 ) }$ upon invitation to the interview. When cited anonymously in the following sections, the main study participants will be identified by the letter $\mathrm { P }$ (standing for APIC) or K (for AKWIC) followed by a string of ‘cohort number - serial number’. For example, P1-5 represents the fifth APIC user in the first round. The user data and questionnaire answers of the six pilot study participants were not included in statistics, since they as college students tended to have higher English proficiency than intermediate users – the target population of this research. However, in the interviews, the undergraduate volunteers provided some good comments in terms of user experience and suggestions, which might be included in the discussion. When cited, they are identified with a letter ‘T’ followed by a serial number from 1 to 6.

# Results

The main study contained two rounds of app use, during which all the eight AKWIC users conducted word queries, while three out of ten APIC participants produced no use data at all, i.e., they did not use APIC any more after the initial introduction tutorial. The three zero-query-users were contacted later for reasons, and they answered that the app was complex to use. Upon reflection, the problem might be that APIC requires one additional step of choosing a pattern before searching for examples. Results from the three methods are set out below.

# Log-based statistics

Statistic data based on automatic logging may help reflect the real behaviour of app use in a quantitative way. The processed results of the raw data are shown in Tables 1 and 2. For the comparison of app use, we mainly adopt the median data instead of the mean value to alleviate the impact of individual variations.

Based on the two tables, there seem to be a few enthusiastic AKWIC users who searched more than 10 distinct words, while APIC users often made much fewer queries. The median amount of distinct queries by AKWIC users is 6, much higher than that of the APIC group. It is similar with the queries per session, with 3.25 versus 2.00. In general, the AKWIC group seem to be more interested in searching a word in the designated app, showing higher user engagement than the APIC group.

For the time used for each query, the median was 1.90 minute for AKWIC, compared to 1.56 minute for APIC. Despite the smaller median value of time spent on each query for APIC, it is too early to claim time saved for its users. To better illustrate the general picture of time spent, the relevant data by each individual were put in a scatter diagram (Figure 7). In Figure 7, the horizontal axis stands for the time used for each query, and the vertical axis represents the participants. The closer a point is to the origin, the less time was spent by the individual. It can be seen that most points are in the interval between 1 to $2 . 5 \mathrm { m i n } \cdot$ - utes, where the square points of APIC users are largely intertwined with the diamond points of AKWIC users. Among them, it seems that more of APIC square points are closer to the origin on the diagram, suggesting that APIC users spent slightly shorter time per query than AKWIC users. Based on the data favourable for APIC, so far it is still not safe to claim that APIC could significantly save time of app consultation.

Apart from the above indicators, the two groups shared much in common in the frequency of repeated queries. The median repetition ratio was very close with $4 8 . 6 3 \%$ for AKWIC versus $4 4 . 4 4 \%$ for APIC. In other words, for both apps, a user tended to retrieve twice and read through 20 concordances when they looked up a word or pattern. However, it should be noted that three APIC users (3/7) made no repeated queries for a pattern, with the repetition ratio at $0 \%$ . This may imply that these APIC users thought they could understand the word use through 10 concordances without a repeated query for more examples.

In short, it seems that AKWIC users were more motivated to use the designated app, and APIC users might spend a little shorter time when they consulted the apps for word use. There is a possibility that APIC users simply gave up the slightly more complex app consultation and fled in a shorter time. However, compared with the data from the pilot study, it seems that the query efficiency can be associated with language proficiency: the six undergraduates, as more skilful language users, turned out to complete app consultation in a shorter time, always less than 1 minute per query. Additionally, in their responses to later questionnaires and interviews, most of the pre-university participants claimed to follow the strategy of ‘hit and run (find the answer and exit)’ on the loaned tablets.

# Questionnaire and interview responses

The responses from the questionnaires and the interviews/focus groups have been sorted out, mainly to shed light on the perceived effectiveness of the two methods. The qualitative data may also provide some indirect support for the above assessment of user engagement and efficiency.

Two questions in the questionnaire were designed to investigate how effective the two methods were thought to be. One is about the display method: users were asked how often the way to display the search results helped them find the correct verb structure. With slight differences between AKWIC and APIC users, around half of them in both groups reported that the display method could ‘sometimes’ help them find the target structure, and the remaining users felt that they could ‘often’ get the assistance. The other question asked the users how difficult they managed to find the word structure in the end. The majority of AKWIC users (over $6 0 \%$ ) reported to achieve it ‘with some effort’, and the proportion was higher at $8 6 \%$ for APIC users. Only a couple of respondents thought that they completed the process ‘with difficulty’ or ‘easily’. Given the responses, it appears that APIC is not perceived to be more effective in helping users recognise the specific word use.

From interview answers, the participants seem to willingly embrace the presentation of examples in the concordancing form, which is new to them. Respondents from both groups recognised that the highlighting methods - yellow-painting and central alignment - helped them focus on the target form (word or pattern use). A representative comment comes from K1-2, an enthusiastic AKWIC user:

I think it’s the best way, if you highlight the word. Because we look for a word, and how it is used in context. And you provide all text, and you highlight it in the middle. I think the highlight[ing] is a good idea.

The APIC users were also generally positive towards the display method. For example, P1-5 reported that the highlighting helped him “notice the common usages”. Other APIC users seemed to enjoy the novelty of concordancing, saying that they “never met with this method” (P1-1 and P1-4), In comparison, a few AKWIC users required some further processing of the results. For example, K1-2 suggested providing “collocations and phrases” of the target word prior to concordancing. That are exactly what APIC is supposed to deliver to learners.

Additionally, APIC seems to provide more information on linguistic features beyond individual words. Many AKWIC respondents acknowledged that the designated app was most helpful for their vocabulary enlargement. For example, T5 in the pilot study answered that he looked for “paraphrasing synonyms” in the app. By comparison, APIC participants often felt that their knowledge on grammatical or sentence level was enhanced. For example, T4 illustrated what she obtained from the APIC examples:

Because when you click, you will see how to use the words, plus some, what it is called, prepositions? The structure, yea. I do need the structure, because when we need to write assignments, we do not only need to know how to use single words, but also need to know how to use words in groups, in sentences, in an accurate format. I think to me, it’s more grammar-based.

The effects on grammar awareness were echoed by T1 and P1-5, who reported that APIC helped on “more grammar than vocabulary”. Therefore, while KWIC might help building vocabulary through great language exposure, PIC at the interface of vocabulary and grammar seems potential to invite more attention to grammatical use.

Based on the above results from questionnaires and interviews, it can be seen that mobile DDL can be feasible, as most users were happy to work with concordances, although reading through numerous examples always takes effort. However, no evidence shows that pattern-based concordancing, or PIC, can better help identify language usage; no explicit testimonial is found to claim that ‘PIC is more effective’. Therefore, even though the multiple benefits of PIC beyond vocabulary building were acknowledged by a few users, it is not safe to conclude that PIC is advantageous in perceived effectiveness.

One last question in the questionnaire was designed to check the probability of future app use: the participants were asked how possible they would like to use their designated app in the future. It turned out that as many as three fourths of AKWIC users were uncertain, as they selected the answer of ‘maybe’ or ‘don’t know’. By contrast, the majority of participants in the APIC group would ‘probably’ use the app in future, and those reluctant to continue using accounted for less than $3 0 \%$ . In other words, APIC seems to stand a better chance of attracting users in future. Apparently, the result does not concur with the lower engagement of APIC as indicated by quantitative use data above. This contradiction will be interpreted in the next section of ‘Discussion’ together with data in other aspects.

# Discussion

Based on the quantitative and qualitative data collected, it can be seen that, firstly, AKWIC users demonstrated higher engagement, since they did more word searches in the app than their APIC counterparts. It is speculated that this is because learners are more familiar with the procedure AKWIC entails: searching a word and finding examples, which bears a great resemblance to looking up a word in an ordinary electronic dictionary. In fact, the app was introduced to the participants as ‘a dictionary of many examples’ before research commencement. To operate APIC seems more demanding, since the notion ‘pattern’ is unfamiliar to them, and there is an extra step of choosing the pattern to search before moving to the concordancing interface (see Figure 3 above). The novelty of the PIC method is insufficient to retain users. The three zero-query APIC users claimed that their non-participation was because the app was complex to use, which may partially support our interpretation. Mobile learners seem to stress and favour simplicity and ease of use for their learning tools. Hence, during the development of mobile learning apps, usability should be made at least as equally important as functionality. To enhance usability of apps, multiple factors, such as learnability, operability, accessibility, etc. should be given more attention to (Sarrab et  al., 2021).

Secondly, use data indicate that APIC could possibly save a little time when the users attempted to find out specific language use among numerous examples, though the time reduction appears insignificant. With reference to the theoretical comparison between deductive and inductive approaches (Ellis & Shintani, 2014) and also the research results by Lee and Lin (2019), we initially hypothesised that partially deductive PIC approach based on pre-set patterns would be less time-consuming than fully inductive KWIC. However, this cannot be supported by strong quantitative evidence. Perhaps it is worth testing introducing more deductive elements in DDL to enhance efficiency and alleviate the disadvantages of its inductive nature.

Thirdly, no explicit answer can be found in the questionnaires and interviews to suggest whether APIC is advantageous over AKWIC in perceived effectiveness. Both groups expressed more or less positive attitudes towards the apps and methods, particularly in the face-to-face interviews, perhaps trying not to threaten face of the researcher and app developer. Interestingly, slightly more APIC users, though seemingly less enthusiastic, would continue to work with the app. This is not in line with the prior assessment results of engagement. One possible explanation is that APIC users were less engaged simply because the app involved an unfamiliar notion and more complicated steps; after a limited time of trial use, they would embrace APIC as a reference source based on its potential edge in functionality over AKWIC.

# Conclusion and implications

In this research, the two methods - PIC and KWIC – were compared by using two self-developed apps on the mobile platform. In a nutshell, for the three hypotheses, H1 on learner engagement is rejected in favour of AKWIC, while H2 on efficiency and H3 on perceived effectiveness cannot be explicitly rejected based on existing data. Some data may imply that APIC could offer pedagogical benefits (less time to find out word use, more attention to grammatical structure), but this cannot be further evidenced. The mixed picture may be attributed to the small number of participants and the absence of direct observation and instructed tasks in the mobile learning setting. Therefore, as a whole, it appears that PIC has no distinct advantage over KWIC to help intermediate ESL students with academic English.

Despite the inconclusiveness, the synergisation of PIC and mobile DDL may shed some light on how to directly use corpora in the context of mobile-assisted language learning. It can be seen that both PIC and mobile adaption may potentially enhance concordancing experience of non-expert users, who may benefit from the substantial yet convenient language exposure. On the one hand, while adhering to great exposure to authentic language, PIC can enable more focused and friendlier language observation by learners, since the search items are word-associated patterns categorised beforehand. On the other hand, mobile technology can lower the threshold of DDL on digital literacy of learners. Given the penetration of mobile devices into the new generation of learners, if a dedicated mobile concordancer is iterated in accordance with learners’ behaviour in mobile learning, perhaps only a short-term training session is needed for them to embrace the DDL concept and familiarise with concordancing practice on the mobile platform. If the accessibility of corpus resources can be continuously enhanced via emerging technologies, DDL may have a greater chance of being integrated into the mainstream pedagogy, so as to better release its potential as a source of rich materials and a helpful approach for language learning.

# Limitations

One apparent limitation of this research is the small number of participants involved, which has a significantly negative impact on the reliability and generalisability of the results. The size of participants was greatly restrained by the number of available tablets and volunteers. We endeavoured to introduce more qualitative data for triangulation, but it would be more desirable to engage more subjects from the target population. Another major limitation is that the participants only used one app to experience either PIC or KWIC, and they were not aware of the other app and method. As a result, there was and would be no explicit feedback claiming ‘PIC/KWIC is better’.

Therefore, planning of further research is underway with two major changes to offset the flaws in research design: the one is to initiate more rounds of user experiments, so that more qualitative and quantitative data can be obtained from a larger user base; the other is to expose the participants to both apps, so that they can make explicit comments on which method is more effective, efficient and helpful.
