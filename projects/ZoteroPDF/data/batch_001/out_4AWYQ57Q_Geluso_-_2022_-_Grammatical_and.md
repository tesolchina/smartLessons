This study investigates recurrent discontinuous multiword sequences, or phrase frames, of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of in English argumentative essays authored by L1 English and L1 Spanish speakers. This pattern of phrase frames is important as it comprises prepositional phrases which are a conspicuous feature of grammatical complexity in academic writing. The target frames are analyzed through the lens of grammatical complexity and discourse function, while also exploring trends in frequency and accuracy. The principal finding is that both L1 groups often used the target frames to serve as a textual bridge within sentences, with the frames usually fulfilling an adverbial or post modifying function while simultaneously identifying an intangible quality or marking a procedure or process of a following noun phrase. The major difference between the two L1 groups is that the L1 English speakers used the frames for postnominal modification and an intangible framing discourse function at higher rates than the L1 Spanish speakers. This was particularly evident with the frame on the \* of. Finally, more errors with the definite article and prepositions were identified among the L1 Spanish group, suggesting that instruction of the target frames could be a worthwhile pedagogical endeavor.

# 1. Introduction

Succesful academic writing is a crucial skill for those pursuing higher education where English is the de-facto lingua franca of international education. One aspect that separates novice writing from expert writing i the degree of grammatical complexity and information density where expert writers are more proficient than their novice counterparts (Biber et l., 2011; Parkinson & Musrave, 2014). Research has demonstrated that prepositional phrases and noun phrases are an effective method of increasing information density, and develop later as novice writers become more proficient in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2010; Biber et al., 2011; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014). However, mastering the prepositions and articles inherent to these phrasal features can be challenging for English language learners (Gass et al., 2020).

One possible avenue to improving accuracy and efficacy in the use of prepositions and article is through improved familiarity with formulaic language that features prepositions and articles. The most obvious instances of formulaic language can be found in continuous multiword sequences such as $\boldsymbol { n }$ grams or lexical bundles, but formulaic language can be discontinuous as well (Biber, 2009; Eeg-Olofsson & Altenberg, 1994; Renouf & Sinclair, 1991; R0mer, 2010). Much work on discontinuous formulaic language has focused on what Stubbs (2007) and Fletcher (2002-2012) described as \*phrase frames". Romer (2010) defined phrase frames, or simply "frames", as "n-grams with an internal variable slot' (p. 103). Examples include the \* of the, it is ${ } ^ { * } t o ,$ and on the \* hand, where the asterisk rret ariale slo tht ca e flld o oplete aexical unde such as the edf the  i likely o, and on the other hand Studies that have considered 4-word frames and bundles have consistently found those comprised of function words (i.e., function word frames) to be frequent in written registers (Biber, 2009; Gray & Biber, 2015; Renouf & Sinclair, 1991). Among the most frequent 4-word frames, particularly in academic writing, are those with a preposition preceding the 3-word frame the ${ ^ { * } o f } ,$ such as in the \* of and at the \* of (Biber, 2009; Chen & Baker, 2010; Gray & Biber, 2015). Thus, frames of the paten preosition + the \* of are of interes for numerous reaons. For one, they are recurrent and productive in that they host a broad array of fllers in the variable slot accounting for many lexical bundles (Gray & Biber, 2015). Secondly, they are based in prepositional phrases and hence functionally useful in aca demic writing as they can increase information density and grammatical complexity. Finll, the fixed components, prepositions and the definite article, are typically dificult aspects of language for learners to master (Gass et al., 2020).

The primary goal of the present study is to gain insights about the textual characteristics in terms of grammatical complexity features and discourse function f rcurrent frames of the patten preposition + the \*f as produced in English argumentative essays by novice L1 English and L1 Spanish authors. A secondary goal is to take stock of frequencies and investigate accuracy of use between groups. Beter understanding of how L1 English and Spanish speakers use recurrent frames of this pattern could nform instruction not only for these1 groups, but alonovice writers from other 1 backgrounds such as languages without article systems eg., Krean and Japanese).

# 2. Literature review

Research on grammatical complexity by Biber and colleagues has illuminated the importance of phrasal complexity in academic writing (Biber et al. 2011, 2020; Biber & Gray, 2016). Noun and prepositional phrases have been found to be integral to academic writing as they can function to compress information, thereby increasing information density in writing. Lexical bundles with noun and prepositional phrases are also common in academic writig, examples include the end of the, the natre of the, at the time of, on the basis of, and in the case/absence/form/presence of (Biber & Gray, 2016). Within many of these lexical bundles, function word frames of the pattern preposition + the \*of are present. Gray and Biber (2015) found that function word frames were more frequent in academic writing than frames based in verbs (e.g., was \* n the or other content words (e.g., it \*neceary to). Given the structural make-up of frames of the pater preosition + the\*of, it can be expected that such frames will overlap with preositional phrases as adverbials e. 8., error frequently exist in the world of computers) and postnominal modifier (e.g, our assumptios about the value of life). Underscoring their importance in academic writing, Biber et al. (2011) included prepositional phrases functioning as adverbials and post nominal modifiers in Stages 3 and 4 of their hypothesized five developmental stages of grammatical complexity features in academic writing.

Furthermore, the of-phrase inherent to the pattern preposition $+ ~ t h e ^ { \mathrm { ~ s ~ } }$ of plays an important role in information density as well as discourse function. Sinclair (1991) observed that the frst noun in of-nominal groups often serves to highlight a specialized part, component, aspect, or arbute of the following noun (pp. 87-90). Building on Sinclair's work, Hasselgard (2019) endeavored to further lucidate the relationship between nouns in thecolligational framework' the N1 of the N2, where N1 and N2 represent the firs and second nouns that fll the slots f the framework. Hasselgard found that the N1 often takes the form of a nominalization (eg, the use of the word), or intangible feature f the N2 (.g., the nature of the play), and that the N1 frequently reflecs the astraction and semantic compresson inherent in a nominalization post-modified by an of-phrase (section 4.3.7). Hasselgard categorized N1s of the framework into semantic groups ilstrating that dferet fillers within a semantic goup fulfild simila unctions in the framework. Similar observations have been made by other researchers who have found that semantic similrity among fillers ften results in a frame fulfilling the same discourse function despite featuring unique fillers (e.g., Garner, 2016; Lu et al., 2018).

Functional analyses of bundles are abundant, and recently analyses of frames are increasing. These functional analyses can be broadly divided into two categories: (1) those that focus on discourse functions in the vein of Biber et al. (2004), and (2) those that focus on rhetorical moves in the tradition of Swales' (2004) Creat  Research Space model. The focus here will remain on the former group, but examples of the atter include Cortes (2013) and Omidian, Shahriari, and Siyanova-Chanturia's (2018) studies on bundles, and Lu, Yoon, and Kisselev's (2021) and Yoon and Casal's (2020) studies on frames. Most studies in the former group adopt Biber et al.'s (2004) taxonomy of discourse functions or some adaption of it. Examples of studies on lexical bundles are A;del and Erman (2012), Corte (2004), Simpson-Vlach and Elis (2010), and Staples et al. (2013) Example of frames studies are Garer (2016) and Lu et a. (2018). The thre main discourse functions that bundes fulfil as proposed by Biber et al. (2004) are (1) referential expressions (2) stance expressions, and (3) discourse organizers. Biber et al. (2004, p. 384) explained the three iscourse functions as follows: (1) referential expressions \*make direct reference to physical or abstract entitie .. ether to identify the entity or to single out some particular atribut f the entity as especilly important; (2) stance expresions function to \*expressatitudes or aessments of certainty"; and (3) discourse organizers "reflect relationships between prior and coming discourse."'

Using Biber et al.s (2004) taxonomy, Garner (2016) found that the majority of rcurrent frames in her study fulflled a referential discourse function, particularly the highly recurrent frame the \*of the which frequently overlaps with frames of the target pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of in the present study. Lu et al. (2018) investigated the discourse functions of 5- and 6-word frames in research article introductions from six social science disciplines. Using Simpson-Vlach and Elis' (2010) adaption of Biber et al's (2004) functional taxonomy, Lu e al. (2018)found that 5-word frames most frequently served a referential discourse function, and within the referential function, the second-level category, \*specification of atriutes was the most common Specification of aributes contains its own subcateories such as identifying abtract qualitie, size or form, or quantities of afollowing noun phrase (Biber et al., 2004, p. 395). Given the findins of dffent functional analy of frames basd in f-phrases, i can be hyothei that frames of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of will also often serve a referential discourse function and specifically some type of specification of attributes.

While some studies on frames have considered discourse function, to the best of my knowledge, no studies to date have simul. taneously investigated the rlationship between the grammatical features and discourse functions of frames among novice writers. This study aims to fill that gap while also illuminating trends in frequency and accuracy of the target set of frames.

Specific research questions are:

RQ1: How frequently do novice L1 English and Spanish authors use the function word frames of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of?   
RQ2: Which grammatical complexity features and discourse functions are most prominent among frames of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of and how does this vary between novice L1 English and Spanish authors?   
: RQ3: How accurately do writers use the function word frames of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of, and how does this vary between novice L1 English and Spanish authors?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Corpora, data preparation, and extraction

Argumentative essays from version 2 of the International Corpus of Learner English (ILE; Granger et al., 2009) and the L1 English speaker counterpart corpus, the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays (LOcNess; Granger, 1998), were used for this study. ICLE represents argumentatie and literary essays written by advanced undergraduat EFL learners representing 16 diffrent L1 backgrounds. For the present study, the Spanish (ICLE-SP) sub-corpus was used. Essays in LOCNEsS were written by British and American university students, and also consist of argumentative and literary essays. British A-level secondary chool students are represented in LOCNESS, but were excluded to limit comparisons to L1 and L2 speakers of English at the university level. Word counts for the corpora were generated with a Python script, and words with apostrophes and hyphens were counted as single words (e.g., it's so-called. Table 1 provides an overview of the sub-corpora..

Topic variation is known to afect the lingistic characteristics of texts (Friginal et al., 2014), and while it may have a limited mpact on function word frames (Gablasoa et al., 2017), it is likely to influence the filler of frames, which in turn willaffect discourse function. Therefore, following Schanding and Pae (2018), each essay was reviewed and categorized broady into topical groups. Essay topics in each sub-corpus and number of esays per topic are outlined in Appendix A in the supplementary material online. Topics are also presented in abreviated form in Fig. 3 in Section 4.1. In short, 18 distinct topics were identified, with five topics shared between LOCNEss and ICLE-SP. The mean number of essays per topic was 30.44 with a standard deviation of 18.59.

To asses writing quality in addition to L1 status, each essay was scored using a custom holistic rating scal. The scale was created by adapting the IELTS Task 2 Writing band descriptors (public version), acesed in April of 2018. The scale ranged from 1 to 7 with 1 being the lowest score and 7 the highest. The adapted rating scale is availabl in Appendix B. Ratings were assgned by a group of 15 raters who were trained in either a face-to-face training session or via a telecommunication software such as $\mathrm { Z o o m } \mathrm { \textcircled { R } }$ or Google Hangoutso. The raters were graduate students enrolled in the Applied Linguistics or Rhetoric and Professonal Communication program of a large mid-westen university in the United States and were paid to rat the esays. After completing the training sessions, each rater rated 126 or 127 essays within a two-week period. A Many Facet Rasch Measurement (MFRM) was used to generate an adjusted score or "fair score for each essay (Eckes, 2015). An MFRM generates fair scores by controlling for \*rater severity. Eckes (2015) explained that there will be variation in scores eve between trained rater. As such, raters can constitute a substantl source of variation i cores, and measures of consensus (e.g., Cohen's Kappa) or consistency (e.g, correlation) do not always imply high scoring accuracy (Eckes, 2015). A fair score from an FR, owever, reflets the score n essay would receive from  rater of averag severity within the group of trained raters.

The mean essay score in LOCNEss was 4.97 with astandard deviation of 1.06. The mean essay score in ICLE-SP was 3.64 with a standard deviation of 0.95. The assumption of equal variances in fair scores between groups was not met, so a Welch's independent samples t-test was conducted to test for significant differences. Mean fair scores were significantly different $( t _ { ( 5 4 4 ) } = 1 5 . 4 5$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ with a large effect of $d = 1 . 3 2$ Fig. 1 visualizes the distribution of scores between the two L1 groups.

With the essays compiled and scored, a Python script was used to extract 4-word frames in the combined corpus. Next, al instances of frames of the structure preposition $^ +$ the \* of that occurred at least 10 times per 100,000 words in the combined corpus were identified. This resulted in 11 target frames presented in Fig. 2 in Section 4.1, with a total token count of 2129 frames matching the pattern.

# 3.2. Grammatical and functional analyses

In order to investigate how the target frames contributed to grammatical complexity and the discourse functions that the frames fulflled, two coders used concordances to evaluate each instance f the 2129 frames. subset of relevant grammatical cateories from the body of research on grammatical complexity was used to assign a complexity feature to each instance of the frames (e.g., Biber et al. 199; Biber e al. 2011; Biber et al., 2020; Gray et al., 2019. Given the prositions in the first fixed slot of the target frames, five primary categories featuring prepositions were used: frames overlapping with prepositional phrases that functioned as (1) adverbials, (2) postnominal modifiers, or (3) adjective postmodifiers; and frames overlapping with (4) common multiword verbs, or (5) common complex prepositions. Operationalizations and examples for each grammatical category are provided in Table 2.

Only those multiword verbs and complex prepositions that were identified in the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English (Biber et al., 199) were coded as such. Furthermore, it should be noted that multiword verbs such as talk about are not traditionally part of studies on grammatical complexity, but because they overlapped with a substantial portion of the target frames and because they can be challenging for language learnersto master, they were included in the analysis. Two coders, the researcher and another PhD holder in applied linguistics with years of academic writing teaching experience, participated in a $9 0 \mathrm { - m i n }$ norming session over $\mathrm { Z o o m } \mathrm { \textmu { ‰} }$ and then coded 20 percent of the frames for grammatical complexity. The initial coding reliability as measured by Cohen's Kappa was 0.841 indicating a high level of reliability, and the author completed the remaining 80 percent of coding individually.

The same two coders used a hybrid of Biber t al's (2004) taxonomy and Hyland's (2008) adaption to code all instances of frames for discourse function. Components of Hyland's (2008) taxonomy (e.g., \*procedure/process" and \*topic" under the \*referential function) were used as the adaptions were tailored to features found in academic writing as opposed to the broader corpus of spoken and written registers in Biber e al. (2004). Furthermore, the subfunctions under referential functions in the present study are mostly third-level functions under "specification of aributes" in Biber et al.'s (2004, p. 395) taxonomy. Ultimately, three primary discourse functions and 10 subfunctions were used. Any discrepancies in coding of discourse functions were discussed until aconsensus was reached. This was not always an easy process, and in the event that neither coder could be persuaded to agre with the other, a third coder was asked to make a final decision. Table 3 outlines these discourse functions and provides a short explanation and example for each.

# 3.3. Error analysis

Only actual instances of frames matching the target pattern were analyzed grammatically and functionally in this study as the focus was on novice writers use of frames as they appeared in the texts, not the intended use of frames. However, to gauge the writers overall accuracy with the target frames, three additional patterns beyond preposition $+ t h e ^ { * }$ of were searched using regular expressions to identify intended instances of the target frames for a separate eror analysis. In all 7830 frames were extracted using the search parameters outlined in Table 4.

Following the search parameters in Table 4, concordance lines were extracted and exported to an Excel file for coding. Dulay et al.'s (1982) classfication of general language production errors was followed. Errors were classfied at two levels: Level 1 identified Whether the error was related to a preposition or the definite article; Level 2 categoried errors as (1) omission, (2) addition, or (3) misinformation/misuse. Dulay et al. (1982) classfied omission errors as \*the absence of an item that must appear in a well-formed utterance' (p. 154). For this study, omission refers to a lack of a preposition or the definite article where it was necesary. Addition errors refer to the presence of an unnecessary item (Dulay et al, 1982), which was operationalized as an unnecesary preposition or article in a target frame. Finally, misuse refers to an incorrect preposition or article in a target frame.

The researcher and one other L1 speaker of English completed a 90-min norming session over Zoom. They then independently coded about 40 percent of the 7830 instances. The initial coding reliability as measured by Cohen's Kappa was 0.930 indicating a high level of reliability, and the second coder completed the remaining 60 percent of coding.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Frequency and distribution of target frames

In total, 11 types of frames of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the $^ { \ast }$ of met the frequency threshold of 10 occurrences per 100,000 words in the combined corpus for a total of 2129 tokens matching the patern. To get a better sense of how the target frames were distributed over texts and conduct iferential taistics, freuencies weretallied for each text (rather than y sub-corpus) and nomalized per 1000 words. Overall LOcNEss featured a normalized mean rate of 4.52 target frames per text, with a standard deviation of 3.68. ICLE-SP featured a normalized mean rate of 4.40 target frames per text, with a standard deviation of 3.20. Normalized mean per-text fre quencies by frame are plotted in Fig. 2.

The most striking difference in frequency of use between groups was with the frame onthe \*of where theL1 English speakers used it at more than twice the mean rates of the 1 Spanish speakers.  Welchs independent samplest-test revealed a sinificant difference in mean rates of occurrence of the frame between groups $( t _ { ( 5 0 6 ) } = 4 . 2 2 , p < . 0 0 0 1 )$ and a small effect size of 0.36 as measured by Cohen's d. Frequency differences among other frames were les pronounced and none were statisticall significant. The L1 Spanish speakers used the frames begining with of, at, and about at sightly higher mean rates than th1 English speakers, and the 1 English speakers used to the \*of and by the \*of more frequently than the 1 Spanish peakers. The frames beginning with in, with for, as, and from were very close in their mean per-text counts.

Although not an explicit research question in this study, to help understand the influence of topic on the distribution of frames over texts, Fig. 3 visualizes the proportion of texs i each topic featuring at least one instance of atarget frame. The scale on the right-hand side of the figure ranges from 0 to 1 with signifying zero percent and 1signifying 100percent of texts in a topic featuring at least one instance of a tt frame. The -axis is ordee to to bottom from he most frequent frame in the overal corus, in the \*f toth east frequent, about the \* of. Likewise, the $x$ -axis is ordered, left to right, from the topics featuring the most texts in the corpus to the fewest.

The more frequent frames atthe top of Fig 3, particularl in the \*f, of the \*of, and to the \*of, are clearly distributed more evenly across topics than the less frequent frames. This is exemplified with the frame in the $^ { \ast }$ of, which occurs at least once in about 30 percent or more of texts acros topics with the exception of Money" and Sports and leisure' The more equal dispersion is likely related to the more frequent natre of the frames. Of course simply beause a word, or in this case  frame, is frequent dos not mean it wl be wel dispersed throughout a corpus, but broad dispersion requires at least a moderate frequency. Examining dispersion from topic as a reference point, the target frames are generally best distributed over French culture, Types of theater, and Education and policy" and are rather sparse in the topics "Inventions", Technology stifles the imagination', and \*Universty'. While the vast majority of frames lacked an obvious connection to topic, topic does appear to have at least a limited influence on the use of the target function word frames under study here. Taking the topic of Types of theater" as an example, this effct can be see with the frames in the \*f with the \*f and s the \*of. For instance, the frame inthe \* f was somtimes part f eference  spcific plays , rflected inthe titl of one of the plays). With the frame with the \* of, the most frequent filler was restoration, where the frame was used to refer to theaters re-opeing ., with the retoratio f the monarcy, thtres were re-pened .). As finl eaple, s the \* of ws oen used to identify a role of a character in a play (e.g., as the daughter of the inn keper). The examples here provide at least some evidence that topic can influence word choice at the level of fller of the frames, which in turn has implications on the election of th frame itself.

# 4.2. Analysis of grammatical complexity features and discourse functions

The normalized mean per-text frequencies of the grammatical features that the target frames overlapped with are outlined in Table 5. The most distinct diffrences between sub-corpora were in frames as part of prepositional phrases functioning as adverbials and postnominal modifiers, and common multiword verbs. Prepositional phrases as adverbials and postnominal modifiers, both of which were more frequent in LOCNEss, reside in Stages 3and 4 of Biber et al's (2011) hypothesized stages of grammatical complexity development. While common multiword verbs are not part of Biber et al.stages, they have ben shown tobe dificult for leaners to master. The greater use of these three features in LOcess may indicate that the authors are further along in the developmental stages of complexity than their ICLE-SP counterparts.

At the level of individual frame, between-group frequency differences in grammatical complexity features were most pronounced with for the \* of and on the \* of. These differences are visualized in Fig. 4.

While the frame for the \* of (let half of Fig.4) was used for adverbial functions in LOCNESs more frequently than i ICLE-SP, the L1 Spanish authors more frequently used the frame in adjective postmodifiers. Furthermore, the instances of adjectival post-modification in ICLE-SP were generally wellformed and not featured in particularly ow scoring esays, indicatig that this difference was likely not due to lack of mastery f the target language, but different functional choices in employing the frame. Example 1illustrate the frame as part of aprepositional phrase fulilling an adverbial function in LOCNEss, and Example 2 ilustrates an adjective postmodifier in ICLE-SP. The parentheses after the examples include the essay filename followed by fair score.

1. .. all were created for the purpose of advancing a civilization. (LOCNEss 142, 4.38)   
2. Technology is not responsible for the lack of dreaming and imagination. (ICLE-SP 750, 3.49)

The frame on the \* of was more than twiceas frequent overall in LOCNEss compared to ICLE-SP. Accordingly, as seen in the right half of Fig.4 the frame occurred as an adverbial and multiword verb in LOCNEss at about twice the rate as in ICLE-SP, and about six times the rate as a postnominal modifier. Example 3 depicts the frame as part of a prepositional phrase functioning as an adverbial. explaining how the medical community continues to exist. Example 4 llustrates the multiword verb depend on overlapping with the target frame, and Example 5 features a postnominal modifier that answers the question of which with regard to the preceding noun.

While the prepositional phrases inherent to the frames often reveal syntactic ties to preceding text (at the \* of being a notable exception as it often occurs as an introductory phrase), the discourse function points to what follows. For instance, returning to Examples 3 through 5, each frame poins to a procedure r procese., preeation or an intangible quality e.,stngth) f afollowing noun phrase. The data from the present study is congruent with Biber et al.'s (2004) observation that most referential bundles are built around noun or prepositional phrases. As seen in Table 6, among the target frames, referential discourse functions occurred over 20 times more frequently than text organizing discourse functions in both L1 groups, and marking stance was even rarer.

The most frequent frame used as a text organizer by far was in the \*f with case as the fille tocreate the lexica bunde in the case of. This bundle was slightly lessfequent in LOCNESS compared to ICLE-SP, occurring at a normalized mean rate of 0.08 (20 raw oc. currences over 18texts) verus 0.132 raw occrrences over 18 texts) in the resective sub-corpora. The relatively frequent use of this lexical bundle in ICLE-SP may be due to the direct translation from Spanish: en el caso de.

Returning to the more frequent referential discourse function, normalized mean per-text counts of the subfunctions between sub. corpora are displayed in Table 7. In both sub-corpora, the target frames were most frequently used to mark intangible framing, fol. lowed by the marking of a procedure or process. The former was more frequent in LOcNEss and the ltter in ICLE-SP. These two frequent subfunctions were followed by marking a location or time, quantification, tangible framing, and finall the marking of topic.

In both LOCNESS and ICLE-SP the frames in the \* of, of the \* of, to the \*of, and with the \* of were commonly used for intangible framing or to mark a procedure or proces. As seen in Fig. 5, the frames beginning with in of, and to were used at higher rates for intangible framing in LOCNEss (eft half of Fig. 5), but more frequently for marking a procedure or process in ICLE-SP (right half of Fig. 5). However, no single fller for any of the frames separated the groups by accounting for a disproportionate number of frames. That is the frames were roductive in both LOCNEss and ICLE-P hosting a broad array ofillers In general, ICLE-SP featured more nominalizations in the filler slot which resulted in higher rates of marking a procedure or process.

The major exception to frames marking intangible framing or a procedure or process was the frame at the \* of which was often used to mark location or time, and occurred at similar rate in LOCEss and ICLE-SP, averaging normalized rates of 0.36 and 0.40 instances per text, respectively. The fille end was the most frequent fller in LOCNEss and ICLE-SP averaging about 0.10 and 0.21 ocurrences per text in the respective corpora. This was followed by begining at 0.05 and 0.07 occurrences per tex. Examples6and 7 illutratethe adverbial nature of these frames as they mark a place or time related to the following noun phrase.

The frames with the most striking differences in discourse function between sub-corpora were again for the \* of and on th \* of. Recall that these two frames also had the most considerable dierences in terms of their grammatical complexity features (se Fig. 4). Differences in the discourse functions that these two frames fulfill are visualized in Fig. 6.

The authors in LOCNEss used the frame for the \* of (left half of Fig. 6) more frequently for intangible framing while the ICLE-SP uthors used it more to mark a procedure or process.In LOcNess, the frame featured frequent fillers such as benefit and good, but neither fller appeared in the frame in ICLE-SP. This is surprising, particularly given the common nature of the word good. xamples 8 and 9illstrate these common fillers in use in LOcess. The prepositional phrase housing the frame in both example simultaneously fulfll an adverbial grammatical function, adresing the question of why something in the preceding text was done or happened, and an intangible framing discourse function by presenting an abstract qualit related to the fllowing noun phrase. Iti also seen in Fig. 6 that the frame onthe \*of was used to fulfil an intangible framing discourse function at much higher rates in LOCNess than ICLE-SP but there was little difference in rates marking a procedure or process.

Synthesizing information from the functional analysis with the frequency and grammatical analyses it is apparent that on the \*of is more frequent overall in LONEss see Fig. 2), used as an adverbial, postnominal modifier, and multiword verb at far geater rates in LOCNEss (see Fig. 4), and typicaly functions to fulfll intangible framing for a following noun phras. These patterns of use in LOCNESS are illstrated in Examples 10 through 12. For instance, in Example 10 the frame serves an adverbial function identifying where the focus of the argument is before identifying an intangibleattribute of atomic usage. A postnominal modifier i illstrated in Example 11 as the frame functions to identify which thories whil simultaneously identifying an abstract, intangible quality of the noun phrase that follows. In Example 12, the multiword verb take on overlaps with the frame which again identifies an intangible aspect of the subsequent noun phrase.

12. There are also times when foods tend to take on the smells of other foods to which they are near. (LOCNEss 135, 5.16)

The grammatical and functional analysis presented here revealed a pattern in which the target frames often functioned as a textual bridge connecting what precedes the frame to what follows. The frames typically served an adverbial or postmodifying function, adding information to a prior noun phrase or verb while simultaneously presenting some intangible or procedural aspect of a following noun phrase. This finding is valuable as it points to a method of presenting the target patern to learners in terms of how the frames function grammatically, as well as the intangibl or procedural nature of common fllers of the frames. Pedagogical implications ae discussed in more depth in Section 4.4. Accuracy of frame use is considered in the next section.

# 4.3. Error analysis

The error analysis identified 0.07 and 0.51 errors per 1000 words in the overall LOcNEss and ICLE-SP sub-corpora, respectively. Table 8 prsents the errors at two levels: (1) preosition r article, and 2) addtion, omission, or misuse. With CLE-SP, the majority of errors were misuse of a preposition or omission of the definite article with about 0.25 and 0.16 instances per 1000 words in the oeral sub-corpus, respectively. The findings resented here echo those f Shin et al. (2018) and Le e al. (2020). Shinet al. found that misuse was the most frequent among preposition errors in bundles, and Lee et al. found that omission was the most frequent among definite article errors in bundles.

With regard to misuse of prepositions in ICLE-SP, there were 50 raw instances of errors in the firs fixed slot of the frame, most commonly with the frames to the \* of and i the \*of. With the former, towas often erroneously used in place of for such as in Example 13.In fact thrisunde, t th cuse f, in pla for th ausefa mch f th requey differ fthis frme flfilling a procedure or process discourse function at higher rates in ICLE-SP than LOCNEsS (see Fig. 5).

13. The purpose of this esay is to convince those who sillthink that feminism has done no god to the cause of women . IcLE-sP 823, 4.75)

With respect to the frame in the \*of, many instances of misuse in ICLE-SP can be traced to what i likely crosslinguistic inluence as Spanish features the preposition en which can translate not only to in, but also sometimes on and at. The target phrases in Examples 14 and 15 likely translat from en la esquina de nuestra call and en el fondo de todo mal in Spanish, respectively. At first glance, erors such as that in Example 14 appear to help explain why the frame on the \* of occurs at much lower rates in ICLE-SP than LOCNESS. However, there were also instances where on was erroneously used such as Example 16. In this example, the prepositional verb consist of would have been the correct choice rather than cons on. This illstrates the difficulty that even more proficient L2 learners face with phrasal and prepositional vers as the essay received an above-average fair score of 5.24. Considering all instances of misuse with on the \* of results in what would be a net gain of only two frames. Thus, the L1 Spanish speakers may simply avoid using the frame due to unfamiliarity with typical formulaic patterns, rather than errors causing the frame to go undetected.

16. Consisted on the belief of a life beyond death (ICLE-SP 805, 5.24)

The rate of omission of the definite article among 1 Spanish speakers was more surprising than the comparatively high rate of misuse of prepositions. While Lee et al. (2020) found omission to be the most frequent source of errors around the definite article in lexical bundles, their target learner population was 1 speakers of Korean. Korean, unlike Spanish, does not have an article system, and thus omission may be more expected. Omission in ICLE-SP was most prevalent in the frames in the \* of and of the \* of as seen in Examples 17 and 18. The error in Example 17 likely stems from cross-ingustic influence as the target phrase can translate to en presencia de mujeres in Spanish. However, Example 18 would likely translate to la idea de la eistencia in Spanish, so this may be an intralingual rror. While misuse and mission errors were more frequent, addition errors wer also present Example 19 llustrates such an error ith th ram inthe \*f.

# 4.4. Pedagogical implications

As Shin et al. (2018) and Lee et al. (2020) proposed, the evidence laid out in the present study suggests that it may be worth pursuing preposition and artice instruction via formulaic language. Both the diferences and similaritie betwee groups in the present study provide useful information that could be aplied to inform pedagogy. For one, with regard to L1 Spanish speakers, attention could be focused on using the frames for postnominal modification, particularly with the frame on the \* of. Prominent illers of the frame such as art subject, and issue could be given as illustrative instances f how the frame postmodfies preeding tet and points to an intangible attribute of what follows.

The similar patterns of use between L1 English and Spanish groups uncovered here could be beneficial to L1 speakers of languages that do not feature article systems such as Japanese or Korean. Previous reearch has shown that frames of this patten occur at much lower frequencies in essays by L1 speakers of Japanese (Geluso, 2019), and lower frequencies of preposition-based bundles among Korean learners of English (Lee t al., 2020; Shin et al., 2018). Both groups under study here used the majority of frames as adverbials or postnominal modifiers, and to mark intangible framing or a procedure or process of a following noun phrase. Teachers might use authentic examples to explain and illstrate how the prepositional phrases that house the target frames are an efficient method of increasing information density in writing as wellas grammatical complexity. This can be followed by highlighting how the frames also serve to connect preceding text to what follows. For instance, teaching materials could guide students to notice that at the \* of often serves an adverbial function, in the \* of frequently serves an adverbial or postmodifying function, and of the \* of is typicall a post nominal modifier. Learners could then be prompted to identify the discourse functions of frames, distinguishing intangible framing from marking a procedure or proces, or identifying a location of what fllows. Furthermore identifing discourse function f frames can be relatd o the nature of the fillrs of the frames, such as astract and proes nouns. The smantic characteristics of the fillrs s something that was beyond the scope of the present study, but has been addresed in other studies on frames (e.g, Hasselgard, 2019) and can be included when creating teaching materials.

# 5. Conclusion

This study provided an exploratory investigation of the grammatical and functional characteristics of recurrent frames of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of as produced by L1 speakers of English and Spanish, while also taking stock of frequency and accuracy of use. In response to RQ1, while there was only subtle variation in rates of recurrence between sub-corpora among most frames, the frame on the \* of featured a striking difference with much higher use in LOCNEss. With regard to RQ2, the overarching trend in both groups was to use the frames to add information to preceding discourse in the form of adverbials or postnominal modifiers, while simultaneously identifying an intangible or procedural aribute of a following noun phrase. Differences between groups were iden. tified in the type of grammatical and discourse functions the frames fulfilld, particularly with the frames for the \* of and onthe \*f.

Essays in LOcNess featured frames functioning as postnominal modifiers at higher rates than in ICLE-SP, and more ften serving an intangible framing discourse function. Meanwhile, the discourse function of marking a procedure or process was more prevalent in ICLE-SP. Finally, with respect to RQ3, erors in the frames were far more common in ICLE-SP with most stemming from misuse of the first prepositionr omission of the definite artice from the frame, and there was seeing avoidance of frame on the \*f among the L1 Spanish speakers.

There are limitations to acknowledge in this study. First, only 1 peakers of English and Spanish were compared. Admittedy,this restricts the generalizability of the study. Nonetheles, the findings are arguably sill of value to other 1 groups in addition to L1 Spanish learners of English as described in Section 4.4. Secondly, the data extraction focused only on the pattern preposition $+ \ t h e ^ { \mathrm { ~ * ~ } }$ of and slight variations of this pater in search of errors. One might argue that of-phrases following a noun phrase without the definite article and with the indefinite article should have been included in the analysis, but the focus of this study was on phrase frames of the pattern preposition $^ +$ the \* of, not preposition $+ \ N P$ of. Additionally, as one reviewer pointed out, the choice of pattern precluded the analysis of two internal variable slots (e.g., in the \* \* of), or preposition $^ +$ the NP of, which would have allowed for modifiers within the target frames (eg.,from the very begining of). Inclusion of frames with two variable lots would hae added 478 instances to the 2129 instances of frames analyzed in the present data set. The additional 478 frames were roughly evenly divided between groups with 235 instances in LOcess and 243 in ICLE-SP. Whileallowing for two variable slots in this patern of frames is certainly recommended for future studies, it should be noted that not all instances featured the typical premodifier $^ +$ noun combination in the variable slots. For example, searching of the \* \* of returned the fllowing instance with an adverb phrase within the frame: prefer to sit in front of the televisio instead f reding. Instances such as this would not fit in the grammatical and functional taxonomy used in this study, and thus would need to be excluded or analyzed separately.

Despite the limitations, the present study provided a unique analysis of recurrent frames from a grammatical and functional perspective. Most notably, the study ilustrated similarities and differences between groups in how the target frames were used as a textual bridge, providing a grammatical and functional link between preceding and following text. These findings can underpin teaching methods grounded in phraseology for instruction of the definite article and prepositions in academic writing. A next sep will be empirical research examining the effects of teaching methods via formulaic language such as frames and lexical bundles.
