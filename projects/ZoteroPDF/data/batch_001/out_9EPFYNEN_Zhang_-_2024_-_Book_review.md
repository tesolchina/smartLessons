# A Disciplinary Literacy Approach to Reading Across Content Areas, Zhihui Fang, Demystifying Academic Reading. Routledge, New York (2023). 262 pp US\$42.36; UKf34.86, ISBN: 9781032386881

Academic reading, often perceived as a generic competency within language education and subject-specific learning, necesitates a nuanced proficiency encompassing \*specialized content knowledge, advanced language skill, sophisticated cognitive strategies and discipline-relevant experiences and motivations" (Fang, 2020, p. 77). Zhihui Fang's recent publication constitutes a valuable contribution to the cultivation of this comprehensive capacity. In contrast to conventional methodologies that embrace a "one-si. ze-fits-all pproach in literacy instruction, Fang's work advocates for adiscipline-based strategy that encourages a mindset employed by experts within specific disciplines during their literacy practices. The book, organized to ilustrate this approach through K-12 subjects such as literatre, histry, science, and mathematics, provides techer and techr eucators, collee reading instructors, and scholars of academic reading acros various disciplines with indispensable knowledge, toos, and resources for the development of academic reading proficiencies.

The book comprises six chapters, commencing with the conceptual framework (Chapter 1) and progressing through its pragmatic application in literature (Chapter 2), history (Chapter 3), science (Chapter 4), and mathematics (Chapter 5) reading. The concluding Chapter 6 delineates measures aimed at cultivating teacher expertise in academic reading instruction. Recognizing prior unsucessul endeavors to tackle academic reading challenges, the first chapter introduces the disciplinary literacy approach as a mechanism to facilitat the dissemination of disciplinary knowledge. This approach views reading \*not merely as a set of tools or strategies for learning from texts but as an interal part of disciplinary practices (p. 29), giving precedeceto disipline-specific erning objectives over isolated litracy outcomes. In pursuit of this objective, Fang advocates for acquiring and conveying discipline-specific and discipline-relevant knowledge, comprehension, skills strategies, practice, and cognitive approaches. The subsequent four chapters delve into the challenges encountered, the expertise sought and teaching instructions relevant to four core academic subjects.

Literary reading (Chapter 2), characterized by varied structures, linguistic subtleties, and interdisciplinary inluences, constitutes the primary subject of analysis. Fang's examination of expert reading research reveals that profound interpretations of literary texts arise from a command of itrary traditions, inguistic inricaies, and multifaceted analytical techniques such as predicting, annotating, and engaging with paratext. Drawing upon this expertise, the author proposes pedagogical strategies including communal reading and guided discusions, and provides tols for multi-perspective literary analysi. Educators wil find significant value in the five teaching examples (prose fiction, poems, novell, and plays) presented within English Language Arts (ELA) classrooms, which offer insights into pre-reading activities, adept use of multimedia tols, and scaffolding strategies to facilitate understanding of intricate literary elements such as plots, structures, and character develoments. For an in-depth analysis of language, Fang introduces functional language analysis (FLA), rooted in systemic functional linguistcs (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014), o scrutinize patterns of lexical and grammatical choices. Furthermore, he acknowledges the transformative potential of writing within the learning proces, emphasizing the advantages of employing journals, blogs, response logs, dramatizations, video-recorded presentations, and other methods to deepen comprehension and foster emotional engagement.

Historical reading, a practice necesstating a command of extensive background knowledge, proficiency in complex language, and familiarity with referencing technques, i the focus of Chapter 3 Fang elucidates historians reading stratgie crucial for constructing evidence-based interpretations of historical narratives, encompassing sourcing, contextualizing, corroborating, close reading, perspective taking, and inferrig. Consistent with the disciplinary literacy approach, theauthor avocates for providing students with ample aces to high-quality text,complemented by the implementation of ffective reading heuristcs such as the \*what-why-which. when-how inquiry method, contextualized thinking out loud and the uilization of tools such as Sourcer's Aprentice. Inthe context of close reading, Fang again persuasively recommends functional language analysis to reveal what is the text about' (experiential meaning), \*what is the author's perspective interpersonal meaning), and \*how is the information organized' (textual meaning). For the advancement of argumentative writing, the author inroduces the "genre teaching-learning cycle", comprising four stages: building knowledge and context, analyzing model text(s), playing with language, and constructing text(s).

The exploration of scientific reading (Chapter 4) grapples with the comprehension of technical and abstract information communicated through dense, metaphorical, and hierarchically organized language. Fang sheds light on scientists' comprehensive reading practices of up-to-date texts, employing strategies such as recursive reading, sourcing, skimming, scanning, and verifying. In the pursuit of this expertise the chapter advocates a shift in teaching focus towards building science content knowledge, developing science language, nurturing multimodal competence, and fostering scientific thinking through authentic inquiries. To facilitate the acquisition of scientific knowledge, Fang recommends the utilization of science trade boos and magazines, accompanied by the provision f user-fridy reding d shts. Regadig lagage rficicy, the chater rtates and mplifies the inficance of FLA for close reading. Expanding beyond language, the discussion scafflds the development of multimodal competence with models like Image-to-Wring and tools such as Sketchnote. Acknowledging the imperative role of critical thinking in scientifi reading, Fang suggests that teachers asist students inestablishing diverse perspectives, real-world connections, and enhanced language awarenes. As a holistic ilustration, the chapter culminates in an inqury-centered 5Es (Enquire-Engage-Examine-Exercise-Extend) pedagogical heuristic, exemplified through a middle school science teaching unit.

The last domain addressed is mathematical reading (Chapter 5), which demands proficiency in technical language and abstract visual representations. Scholars in mathematics employ a spectrum of reading strategies involving deconstruction, coordination, questioning, and verification, among others. Fang proposes diverse resources tostimulate and support such practices, advocating for the utilit of visual aids such as prompts, anticipation guides, and Mathematics Problem-Solving Heuristic (MPSH) charts, alongside narraties, biographies, and trade books. While presenting a noteworthy dialectical perspective on linguistic simplification in mathematics reading, Fang argues for the importance f learning to control the reister. To facilitate this, teachers are encouraged to engage students in textual discussions using six piotal discourse moves: wait time iiting participation, revoicing, student revoicing, probing thinking, and another student's reasoning. Once again, Fang underscores the significance of FLA through explicit text analysis samples, highlighting its capacity to unveil the intricate knowledge and reasoning constructed via language and semiotic systems. Complementing the reading practices, the author clls for writing exercises to enhance mathematical comprehension, encompassing activitie uch as crafting formal definitions, justifying processe, maintaining problem logs, and creating mathematics storie centered around key concepts.

The book concludes with a pivotal exploration of \*whose job is it to provide the reading support for adolescent learners?" (p. 214) Drawing on extensive pedagogical experience and research endeavors, the author highlights the urgent need to extend reading instruction beyond elementary school, emphasizing the crucial role of content area teachers in nurturing academic reading skills. With this prerequisite in mind, Fang offers tangible recommendations including a comprehensive understanding of the reading proces, cultivation of text-related competencies (acces, use, selection, etc.), mastery of language nuances (register, metalanguage, visual resources, etc.), and development of intructional design expertise engage, elit, examine, evaluate, etc.). This section, referencing analyses from preceding chapters, elucidates how these rcommendations can be effctively implemented across various disciplines Tailored to met the needs of content-area teacher educators and reading teacher educators, Fang delineates fundamental principles and pragmatic blueprints, including cohorting the reading methods course by discipline, broadening conceptions of text and literacy, enriching literacy pedagogical content knowledge, supporting content area teacher educators for reading instruction and building connections between content area methods and reading methods courses.

The disciplinary literacy vision presented in this book provides an opportunity to reconceptualize the relationship between reading and content, prompting a reconsideration of the responsibility of disciplinary teachers. The argument is compelling, supported by a comprehensive state-of-the-art research review and contextualized case analyses in each chapter. The book's immediate applicability as a teaching sourcebook is evident through myriad examples, tasks, and instructional designs llustrating the nuances of disciplinary academic reading. Even seasoned educators can uncover valuable insights within its pages. For instance, Fang adeptly exhibits the potential of functional linguisic analysis in facilitating close reading, offring a meaning-based metalanguage that teachers can employ to prompt explicit discussions with students regarding how language choices convey ideational content, enact social re lationships, and create organized discourse. Whil the text samples used for ilustration may be relatively limited in size, the meticulousnessof the text analysis in the four subjectbased chapters provides an effective framework to navigate the intricate language inherent in academic texts. Although the book holds particular relevance for K-12 teachers and educators, it significance transcends this demographic. As a college teacher involved in courses such as English academic reading and writing and English for general academic purposes I value the author's recognition of the interconnected and complementary relationship between reading and writing and have derived substantial benefits from the extensive writing exercises outlined in this approach.

There is, however, a potential area for enhancement. While the book extensively describes the complexities of reading within four subjects, fortifying the final chapter with a comparative synthesis detailing the diffrences or commonalities in pedagogical instructions across these subjects would serve to enlighten educators from different disciplines.

Effectively living up to its itle the book genuinely demystifies academic reading with informative and reflective insights for an area requiring substantial improvement. Addressing various aspects such as discursive features, curiculum design, and teacher training, this book proves to be a worthwhile read for individuals involved in imparting academic knowledge and those aspiring to acquire such knowledge.
