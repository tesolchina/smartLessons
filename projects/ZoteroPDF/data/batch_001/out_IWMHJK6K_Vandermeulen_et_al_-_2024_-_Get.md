This study explored writing processes in two languages (L1-Swedish and L2-English) and in two text types (argumentative and narrative) of 158 upper-secondary students by analysing keystroke logging data. The main aim of this study was to identify effective writing processes of argumentative and narrative tasks in L1 and L2. First, results of the mixed effects model analysis showed that students' typical writing processes displayed differences in timing, higher and lower order pauses, production speed, and revision depending on the language in which they wrote and the type of text they wrote. Secondly, using regression model analyses we explored which writing process patterns were positively related to text quality. By combining a reduced set of process measures, we identified effective writing process patterns. These patterns explained a rather substantial part of the variance in text quality, more precisely, between $5 6 . 1 \ \%$ and $6 9 . 3 ~ \%$ This study contributes to the current field of writing process studies by expanding our knowledge of typical and effective writing processes in argumentative and narrative writing in upper-secondary students' L1 and L2. These insights can be used to further shape writing education to support students' writing across languages and text types.

# 1. Introduction

Underlying every text written by a human being, there is cogniive proces. During writing, writers plan what to write they write. and they reise until the text fulfils its intended purpose. The act of writing is an intricate web of processes that, as Hayes (2012) suggests, involves resources in the form of memory, reading and attention as well as control features, such as motivation and goal-setting. At the centre of the writing proes lie writers ideas, their translation into words -ealated by the writer as suitable for the purpose - fllowed by the transcrition of the words into the text under construction. There is a relationship betwen the writing process and the witten product In a study on the proces - product relation in writing, Beauvaise al. (2011) concluded that writers tailor their writing behavior to match the type and quality of the text they are asked to produce' (p. 415).

Writing processes are not static, they vary between writers as well as within writers. Depending on their preferred writing style. writers may be inclined to plan more or to revise more; writer sculpture or engineer their texs (Torrance et al., 1994). Also, the writing medium sters writer towards acertain writing process For example, Van Waes and Schellens (2003) found cler ifferences in how writers produced texts with pen and paper as opposed to when they write on a keyboard. Similarly, the writing task has an impact on how the writing proces plays out as shown by Severinson Eklundh and Kollberg (2003). They describe how a task such as my way to work'required writers to describe in a linear fashion how they moved from their home to their workplace, resulting in ? linear writing process.In contrast, a writing task aimed to compare two journals constructed a more rcursive writing proces, where writers moved back and forth in their texts to create and fine-tune their arguments.

The present study explores the relation between writing processes and text quality. The main aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of both common and effctive writing processes of upper-secondary students in two languages (L1-Swedish and L2- English) and in two text types (argumentative and narrative).

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. The process - product relation in writing

Van den Bergh et al. (2016) define the writing process as a functional dynamic system in which cognitive activities together with the task environment and the writer's resources contribute to the quality of the text. They point to the importance of considering a combination of cognitive activities at certain moments in time to analyse the writing process. There is a substantial body of research into writing processes and their rlation with writing performance (for example, Beauais et al., 2011; Bennet t al., 2020; Bretelt et al., 1994; Deane & Zhang, 2015; Limpo & Alves, 2018; Revesz et al., 202 Sinharay et al., 2019). These previous studies explored what the writing proces of les and more proficient writers loos like, or they aimed to predict the qualit of the text based on process features.

The most frequently used methods of these studies are think-aloud methods and keystroke logging programs. Think-aloud studies involve students verbalising their activities while writing. The analysis consists of identifying and labelling the cognitive activities taking place during the writing process Keystroke loging programs such as Scriptlog and Inputlog record every keystroke, mouse click or movement during the writing process on a computer (Leijten & van Waes, 2013). These logging data are time coded, which allows analysi of several acts of the writing proess Onefthe adantags of kystroke loging ompard to think-aloud) s that it is rather unobtrusive. Students can focus on the writing process and do not have to verbalise their actions. Moreover, the obtained data give factual formation on writing process fetures. These process ftures can be related to certain cognitive sub-procese (Lindgren et al., 2019) nonetheles, interpretation and linking of keystroke logging variables to cognitive actions is not sraightforward (Gal. braith & Baaijen, 2019).

Previous research, both on L1 and L2, found asociations between text quality and different writing proces features related to timing, pausing, production fluency, and revising. In general, students who spend more time on their composition and on actively writing, write texts with a higher quality, both in 1 (Bennett et a., 2020; Guo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016) and in L2 (De Larios et l., 2001; Van Weijen e l., 2008). Stronger writers also have a higher production rate of keystrokes, words and burst (for 1, see for example Allen et al., 2016; Likens et al., 2017; Sinharay et al., 2019; Van Waes & Leiten, 2015; and for L2, see Barkaoui, 2019, Palviainen et al., 2012; Revesz et al., 2022). dditionally, higher proficiency writers pause less fequently and les long (for 1, see Allen et l., 2016; and for L2, se Barkaoui, 2019; Kim et al., 2021). Bth in 1 and in L2, students with higher text scores produce texts in longer bursts and their pausing is often related to planning (e.g. longer pauses take place at sentence boundaries) (Almond et al. 2012; Barkaoui, 2019; Deane & Zhang, 2015), whereas lower-scoring students proceses tend to show more lower-order related pauses (e., pauses withi or between words) indicating dificultie in transcription proceses (Medimorec & Risko, 2017; Wengelin, 2007) or cognitive overload (Barkaoui, 2019). Regarding revision, more experienced writers usually revise les frequently, and they make more content- and meaning-related revisions, whil les skilled writers make more local corrctions related to typography and form (for L1, se for example McCutchen, 1996; and for L2, se for example Barkaoui, 2016, 2019; Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Revesz et al., 2017; Xu, 2018 for L2).

An efficient use of writing processes seems to require acertain level f cognitive maturity that allows writers to engage in high-lel skills such as planning and revising. For example, engaging in planning processes such as outlining and goal-setting and in revision processes has been shown to increase text quality both in L1 (Beauvais et al., 2011; Limpo et al, 2014; Limpo & Alves, 2018; Lopez et al., 2019) and L2 (Al-Saadi & Galbraith, 2020; Barkaoui, 2019; Zhu et al., 2023).

Breetvelt and colleagues (1994) demonstrated the importance of taking into account the temporal distrbution of the cognitive activitie , the mme at whch h occur wh relatig prcs to roct. heffet f sl s actities onhe quality of the text depends on the stage of the process in which they take place. Process activities such as reading the asignment and eval. uating had a positive influence in the beginning of the writing process. In the middle of the writing process a positive influence was found for goal-setting, idea geeration and structuring. Self-instruction, goal-stting, writing and re-reading provedto have a positive influence on text quality when happening during the last phase of the writing process These results were partilly confirmed by van den Bergh and Rijlarsdam (2001). Also in L2 writing, the temporal distribution of pausing and revision related behaviours proved to be significant (Revesz et al., 2023). The study by Revesz et al. (2023) showed that planning activities predominantly took place in the first stages of the writing proces, while revision was present in the later writing stages. By contrast, Lopez et al. (2019) found no evidence that upper-primary students' engagement i specific writing processes at specific times during writing contributed to text quality. The students sent much time on generating ideas and rarely engaged in planning and revisig. In addition, their engagement in planning and revising was ineffective. This is further supported by Torrance et al. (2015) who showed that training Grade 6 students in planning and revising proceses had no effect on the quality of the texts that they wrote.In short, most studies showed the importance of considering the temporal distribution of writing activities in order to capture the relation between writing process and text quality.

# 2.2. Text type, writing processes and text quality

Previous research argues that writing an argumentative text is generally more challenging than writing a narrative text (Beers & Nagy, 2011). This may be due to differences between the genres or text types as regards inguistic features and rhetorical demands. Argumentation requires a more sophisticated vocabulary (Bar-Ilan & Berman, 2007) and grammar (Bers & Nagy, 2011; van Hell e al., 2008). While narration relies on retrieving ideas and content from long-term memory without re-organising (knowledge-telling strategy), argumentation requires a re-organisation of rerieved content and ideas (knowledge-transforming strategy) (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1987). The arumenttive genre, thus, may entail a largr cogntive strain on the writr han the narrative. Such differences in cognitive strain are likely to impact how writers distribute their cognitive resources during writing and this may be reflected in the online writing process patterns.

Research confirms rlations between text type and writing proces patterns but also highlights the intricacie of uch relatios e., Beauvais et al., 2011; Beavais t al., 2014; Medmorec & Risko, 2017; Olie et al., 209; ten Pee et al., 2021; van Hell e al., 2008) Whereas some studies report similar writing process pattens acros geres, ther studies have found genre effects. For example, live et al. (2009) explored writing process atterns in narrative and agumentative L1 witing among primary students and found no genre differences regarding writing fluency and reaction time. Similarly, Beauvais et al. (2014) found no differences in time spent on pre-planning and pausing during primary students' writing of procedural and expository texts including argumentative elements) in L1. However, other studies with older student i secondary education found some gere differences for L1 writing. The participants in a study by ten Peze et al. (2021) wrote longer texts with a higher production speed, fewer revisions and with a more constant flow in the narrative task than in the argumentative task. While ten Peze e l. (2021) did not find genre diffrences in pausing behaviours, Medimorec and Risko' study (2017) among university students showed that the overall duration of pauses was longer and the pause rates were higher at word boundaries when writing an argumentative text. The authors suggest that argumentation requires a more complex and advanced lexical selection than narration (cf. van Hellet al., 2008), putig a higher load on working memory. In sum, relations between text type and writing processes seem to become more pronounced among older students (in L1 writing).

The lack of genre differences in writing process patterns in younger students could be due to students not yet mastering the argumentative text type and therefore implementing a knowledge-tellig rather than a knowledge-transforming strategy (Olive et al. 2009). According to Olive et al. (2009), writing poses a significant challenge to younger students regardes of text type. They need to devote their working memory capacity to the general process of writing rather than to genre-specific aspects of writing. This in tun, may reduce any potential genre effect on writing processes among younger students.

Studies investigating the relation between writing proces, text quality and text genre in an L2 context arescarce. Lu (2022) studied the efc of genre on the relation between 2 writing proficiency and pausing, fluency, and revision behaviours. The author concluded that genre did not modulate the relation between the quality of the writing tasks and the writing process behaviours.

Given that some of the previous studies discussed in this ction found gre differences in wring proess atens, this rases the question whether the quality of the final text might be, at least to some extent, dependent on an efficient use of genre-specific writing processes. To our knowledge, very few studies have explored the relations between text type, writing processes and text quality. However, the studies that we have found show that different writing process patterns may underliefficient narrative and argu. mentative writing respectively (Beauvais et al., 2011; Medimorec & Risko, 2017). In Beauvais et al. (2011), high-quality narratives were associated with a recursive writing pattern with frequent and continuous shifts between translation, reading, planning and revising.  good quality narrative text was in particular ssociated with short translation episodes.his confirms the knowledge-telling nature of narrative writing; students rely on pre-sored narrative schemas in long-term memory that are easy to cces and implement without further reflection. In contrast, high-qualit argumentative texts were associated with a long prewriting pause and much planning time in combination with low writing fluency. This pattern mirrors the high rhetorical demands in the argumentative text type making it necessary to plan and re-organise ideas while taking the reader into account. This is supported by Limpo and Alves (2018) who investigated the effects of planning strategies on argumentative text quality in undergraduate students. They found that the students who engaged in planing strategie bfore writing revised at a later tage in the writing processthan students who did not engage in planning strategies. They wrote more fluently, and mainly produced text in the beginning and middle of the writig proces. They also produced texts that had a higher overall text quality than students who did not engage in any planning proces.

# 2.3. Language, writing processes and text quality

Writers have been shown to employ ifferent writing processes depending on which language they are using for writig. The impact of language on writing depends on a number of circumstances, such as the writer's familiarity with the language, the task at hand or even language typology (Johansson & Lindgren, 2021).

Using a language that is not one's strongest language, such as a second language, may afect writers during all part of the writing process from the formation of ideas to revision of form. Fr example, when writer translat ideas into linguisti form, there may be a second level of translation involved, that from L1 to L2. The retrieval of words and concepts from long term memory may similarly involve a step of translation, or the formation of ideas are intertwined with the writer's inguistic resources and even ideas may be revised due to lack of linguistic means to express them (Lindgren & Sullivan, 2006).

The greater cognitive demand of the second language has been connected with writing proces activitie (e.g pauses, revision) during writing. Previous research found significant diffrences in pausing behaviour between L1 and L2 writing. First, significant differences a the lower pausing levels were found. L2 learners tend to pause more frequently within words (Spelman Millr, 2000), which might reflect uncertinty about or attention to word formation and spelling. Moreover, they pause longer before words (Chukharev-Hudlaine et a., 2019). Secondly, also at the higher order leves such as clause and sentence level, differences in pausing between L1 and L2 were observed. Previous studies, however, showed different results. Spelman Miller (200 found that L2 leaners paused more frequently at clause and sentence level, suggesting that they experience a higher sentence-level planning pressure than when writing in L1. Chukharev-Hudilainen et al. (2019 found that the clause initial pauses were shorter in L2 than i L1, pointing to a lessthorough pre-planning structure of lause i 2. The authors ugsted that 2 writers sem to partly postone planning until after part of the clause has alred been writen (hence, the longer efore word pauses within the clause). As for revisions, they are generally found to be more frquent in2 writing as compared to first language writing (Silva, 1993; Thorson, 2000). Steenson et al. (2006) also found that students made more "lower order" rvisions in L2 (such as spelig) than in L1, and Lindgren and Sullivan (2006) conclude that students revised more athe point of inscription in their 2. However, students do not neessrily revise les content (higher-order revisions) while writing in their L2 as compared to their L1 (Stevenson et al., 2006; Lindgren & Sullivan, 2006).

Not only the writing proces activities per se are afected by language during writing, also how these actvities are organised during writing sem to affect the writing as well as the final product (Roca de Larios e al., 008). In other words, when studying the writing process it is important to take into consideration not only the presence and frequency of different process behaviours but also the moment at which they occur and their variation over the writing proces (i.., temporal distribution). van Weijen (2009) implemented temporal dstribution of writing process activities in her study design when exploring the writing processin L1 and L2 in a group of 18-year-old students. The temporal distribution of cognitie activities was found to be the same between languages; however, the relation between writing proces patterns and text qualit differed. For example, whil planningactivities correlated positively with text qualit only in the beginning of the writing process for L1, planning proved to be beneficial alo in later episodes of the writing process for L2 writing. The same outcome was found in Tillema (2012).

# 3. Aims of this study

This study's aims are to explore students' writing processes (measured by keystroke features related to pausing, production, and revision behaviour) in both thir mother tongue and their second language in two text types, and to rlate writing proces patterns to the quality of the texts.

The main research question is:

What writing process behaviours characterise the writing process leading to higher-quality argumentative and narrative texts written by Swedish upper-secondary students in L1 and L2 (English) respectively?

To reach an answer to the main research questions, several sub-questions need to be addressed:

1. What writing process behaviours characterise the writing process of upper-secondary Swedish students?   
2. And are these writing behaviours dependent on the language in which students writ L1-Swedish and L2-English) and the text type   
(argumentative and narrative)?   
3. What writing process behaviours characterise the writing process leading to a higher-qualit argumentative text in L1 (Swedish)?   
4. What writing process behaviours characterise the writing process leading to a higher-quality narrtive text in L1 (Swedish)?   
5. What writing proces behaviours characterise the writing processlading to a higher-quality argumentative txt in L2 (English)?   
6. What writing process behaviours characterise the writing process leading to a higher-quality narrative text in 2 (English)?

First, we explore whether language (L1-Swedish and L2-English) and text type (argumentative and narrative) have an impact on several aspects of the writing process (RQ1-RQ2). Secondly, we rlate the writing proces to the qualit f the text with the goal to identify writing process patterns that lead to a higher quality text, depending on language and text type (RQ3-6). The first aim is supportive to the second and main aim of this study. Answering the first two research questions results in a descriptive overview of students writing behaviours. This will ive input to answer the remaining research questions (RQ3-6) and lok for writing behaviours related to the higher quality texts, thus answering the main research question of this study.

# 4. Method

# 4.1. Participants

Participants were recruited from an upper-secondary school located in a rural area in the northern part of Sweden. As there is only one upper-secondary chool in the municipality, students come from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. All students attending the second year of upper-secondary education $( n = 1 9 8 )$ ) were invited, and 158 students (age 17/18, 65 female, 93 male) gave their written consent to participate. Fifty-seven students atended a higher educational preparatory program, 101 students attended a vocational program. Participants firs language is Swedish. Given that the Swedish National Curriculum positions English as a core subject, we consider English to be a second language in Sweden rather than a foreign language (Gheitasi et al., 2022). Moreover, Swedish students frequently use English in their out-of-school literacies (Holm et al., 2021; Waldmann et al., 2022). Participants L2 English proficiency was not tested prior to this study. According to the curriculum, the proficiency of the participants in this study should be situated at a B1.2 or B2.1 CEFR level (Skolverket, 2020).

# 4.2. Procedure: data collection

The study was conducted in accordance with the Swedish Act relating to research involving humans (SFs 2003:460) and the ethics guidelines of the Swedish Research Council (Stafstrom, 2017).

The writing assignments were carried out during four separate esions at the students school in groups of 30-50. At the beginning of each sesion the reearch team informed the students in oral and wrien form) about heesions organisation. Sudents wrote the assignments on thir own computer. During the first session, the students were alo introduced to the keystroke logging software ScriptLog (Frid et al., 2014). They practiced to open ScriptLog from a USB-device, to write a short text and to save the file on the USB-device. They were also informed about some limitations (boldface cannot be used, spacing and font cannot be changed). Finally, they received information on how to proced if the software shuts down during writing. Time alocation for each writing assignment was $4 5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Resources such as spelling aids and dictionaries were not allowed. The research team and teachers supervised data collection.

# 4.3. Materials

The students were aked to write a total of four texts: one of each text type (argumentative and narrative) in each language (L1- Swedish and L2-English). The order of language and text type was counterbalanced in a Latin square design. In the narrative writing assignments, the students were instructed to writ a story about A photo" or "A golden key'. For the argumentative assgnment, they had to take a stand on a suggestion from the principal at their school: "school days should start at $_ { 1 0 \mathrm { a m } }$ and end at $5 . 3 0 \mathrm { p m } "$ or "mobile phones should be banned during the whole school day'. To ensure that the students were familiar with the type of writing asignment, the tasks were modelled after the writing assgnment in the National Tests in Swedish and English as regards topics organisation, layout and detal of instruction. The tass underwent apilot study to make sure that the two narrative and argumentative tasks were of comparable difficulty. Fig. 1 shows the instructions that were given to the students usinga photo" and the ban on mobil phones" as examples.

# 4.4. Written text quality measures

To assess the quality of the written texts, we used an adapted version of Jacobs et al. (1981)analyti scoring scheme developed by Sehlstrom et al. (2022). The adaptations were based on recommendations by previous studies (East, 2009; Janssen et al., 2015; Kim, 2020) who raised concerns related to the number of bands in each scale and the subjective weighting of aspects.

A recursive training proces involving trial ratings by the three trained raters was implemented to clarify and develop the criteria for scoring each category in the analytic scoring scheme. The trial ratings were done independently and were followed by a group discussion in the research team when clarifications and changes were made to the scoring criteri. A detailed written instruction was created describing the criteria separating each band in the scoring scheme.

The adapted scoring scheme involves seven text quality aspects: content, organisation, cohesion, vocabulary, language use, spelling, and punctuation. All seven categories were scored with a scale of four bands: 1 (very poor), 2 (poor to fair), 3 (average to good) and 4 (ery goodto excellent). A blinded asessment procedure was used. For the complete scoring scheme with detailed criteria for each measure, we refer to Sehlstrom et al., (2022, 2023).

The raters scored one category at a time during the rating procedure. Interrater reliability was established through double-scoring of $2 0 \%$ of the texts by three independent raters. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICc) were good for all seven aspects ranging from.86 to.95 in Swedish Narrative, from.8 to.98 in Swedish Argumentative, from.82 to.89 in English Narratve and from.89 to.98 in English Argumentative. For this study, the overall text quality based on the mean of the seven sub-scores was used.

# 4.5.Writing process measures

To enable the collection of writing process data in rather large groups of 30-50 students, the data were collected with ScriptLog, a user-friendly keystroke logging software that does not require installation. Due to practical reasons, a limited number f students $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 7 \right)$ missed one or two sessions. The 158 students produced 598 log files. The ScriptLog-files were exported to Inputlog 8, keystroke logging software that ofers multipl options for analysis (Leijten & van Waes, 2013). The log files were pre-processed to remove pause time before the first and after the last keystroke, and submitted for summary, pause, fluency and revision analyses.

Several writing proces measures were calculated based on the Inputlog output. We selected 31 keystroke loing variables related to five writing process aspects: general production and timing, higher order pauses (based on the pause analysis with a pause threshold of $2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m } s \mathrm { \Omega }$ , lower order pauses (threshold of $2 0 0 \mathrm { m } s \mathrm { , }$ , production speed, and revision. The selection of process variables was guided by their interpretaility (ie, the variables are interpretable in the context of one of the five main writing proces apect), and clrity (i.e, he indicators ae clear and straightforward, allowing good understandabilit) (Vandermeule, 2024). For most process measures, it was possible to calculate the values for thre intervals of equal duration (presenting the beginning, middle and end of the writing process. This thre-interval division facilitates interpretation, and is in line with the prevalent practce in writing process studies adopting a functional dynamic approach (van den Bergh et al. 2016). For a limited number of process measures (such as P-bursts, lower order pauses, and revision measures), Inputlog does not fer the data needed to calculate the interval-based variable. Table 1 summarises the process behavioural measures in the current study.

Fig. 1. Examples of the instructions for the narrative and argumentative writing task.

Via visual exploration of boxplots, all process variables were checked for extreme outliers i. data values which lie more than three times the interquartile range below the first quartile or above the third quartile. To determine whether the outliers were the result of off-task behaviour or a technical issue, we did an inspection of these processes using the process graph, leading to the elimination of $1 8 \log$ files. This resulted in a dataset with 580 log files (Swedish - 143 argumentative, 150 narrative texts; English - 141 argumentative, 146 narrative).

# 4.6. Analyses

To address the first aim of our study (exploring th effect of language and text type on the writing process), multilevel analyses via SPSS mixed models were performed (see Section 5.1). Observations of proces measures are nested within students (as they wrote several tasks). Multilvel modeling accounts for this hierarchical structure of nested data (van den Bergh & De Maeyer, 2024) and reduces the probability of Type-I errors (Quene & van den Bergh, 2008).

Building on the first results, we addressed the second and main aim of our study by carrying out multiple regression analyses to explore the relation between writing process and text quality (see Section 5.2).

Given that normal distribution of the data is an assumption to perform both mixed model and regression analyses, the distribution for al writing proces variables was checked using Shapiro-Wilk and histograms. For the 25 variables that did not show a normal distribution, log-transformation was used (natural log) (see Table 1). Mixed model and regression analyses were performed using the log-transformed variables. All analyses were performed using SPsS version 25.

# 5.1. Writing process patterns in two languages and two text types

We aimed to explore writing process behaviours in student writing (RQ1) and to examine whether these writing process behaviours differed acros languages and text types (RQ2). Mixed-efets modeling enabled us to alyse the effects of language and text type, and their interaction.

Three models were built to examine the effect of languages and text type on each of the 31 writing process variables under study: Null model: random effect (participant).

Model 1: main effects of language and text type Model 2: main effects and interaction effect of language and text type.

A model comparison based on the Likelihood Ratio Test and the Chi-square Goodnes of Fit Test indicated which model best fis the ata.

Table 2 presents an overview of the effcts found for the writing proces variables. This table shows whether there was an effect c language, text type, or an interaction efect. It also shows the contrasts (effect estimates and significance), indicting the differenc between the languages and text types. Additionally, the statistics for the best fitting model are given.

In general, resuls show that language and text type have an effect on the majorit of the writing process measures: 20 out of the 31 variables are affected by language, 23 out of the 31 variables are affected by text type.

In addition to the table, we briefly describe the differnces in writing proces between1 andL e Section 5.1.1), the ifferences in writing proces between the argumentative and narratietext type (ction 5.1.2, and the interaction eect between language and/ or text type (Section 5.1.3).

# 5.1.1. Main effects of language

General production and timing. Overal, students spent more time actively writing (and thus les time pausing) when writing in ther L1 compared to when writing in L2.

Higher order pauses. When writing in L2, students produced more P-bursts than in L1. However, i L1, the P-bursts lasted longer and more text was produced in them. Moreover, i all thre episodes of the writing proces, students paused more frequently when writing in L2 compared to when writing in L1.

Lower order pauses. Students paused more frequently within and between words when writing in L2 than when writing in L1. In addition, they paused longer within and between words in L2.

Production speed. Students produced text more fluently inall three phases of the writing proces when writing a text in L1 compared to when writing a text in L2.

Revision. The duration of normal production was longer in L1 writing than in L2 writing. So, in L1, the episodes in which students produced text in a linear way by adding characters at the end of their text in progress were longer than when students wrote in L2. In contrast, the proportion of time spent on deletions was larger for 2 writing. When writing in L2 students deleted more characters than in L1. Aditionally, production in R-bursts was larger in L1 than in L2, implying that students produced more text before carrying out a revision.

# 5.1.2. Main effects of text type

General production and timing. The total time on task and the proportion of active writing time of the process were higher when students worked on a narrative task compared to an argumentativetask. When writing an argumentative text they spent more time pausing than when writing a narrative text.

Higher order pauses. Students produced more P-bursts when writing anarrative text. Additionally, they paused more frequently in interval 2 when working on a narrative tas compared to an argumentative task. Though more frequent, the pauses in interval 2 were shorter for the narrative tass. Also for interval 3 the pauses were more frequent and shorter for narrative tasks compared to argu. mentative tasks.

Lower order pauses. Students paused more frequently within words when writing an argumentative text compared to when writing a narrative text. They paused more frequently between words when writing a narrative text.

Production peed. Text production in the begining of the writing proces was more fluent in the case of argumentative writing comparedonrrative writing. On the ther hand, in the last phase of the proces, text production was more fluent for narratie writing than for argumentative writing.

Revision. Normal production was more frequent, lasted longer, and was more productie in the case of narrative texts compared to argumentative texts. Deletions were les frequent for the argumentative genre. Insertions were more frequent, lasted longer, and included more characters typed in the argumentative genre. The R-bursts were more frequent and shorter in narrative writing tasks. This implies that students' writing was more frequently interrupted by revisions and that the duration of the episodes preceding the revisions were shorter in the case of the narrative tasks compared to the argumentative tasks. In argumentative writing, more text was produced in the episode preceding the revision than in narrative writing.

# 5.1.3. Interaction effects

Higher order pauses. P-bursts were les frequent but more productive in L1 than in L2. This diffrence in P-burst frequency and production btween the two language was larger for thearmenttie gere In adtion, the genrediffernce in P-urs frequency i. e., more P-bursts for the narrative genre compared to the argumentative genre) was significantly larger in the case of L1 writing processes. Moreover, in L1, students produced more text during the P-bursts when working on an argumentative task compared to when working on a narrative one.

The difference in pausing frequency in intervals 1 and 2 between the two languages (with pauses being more frequent for L2) was significantly larger when students wrote an argumentative text compared to when they wrote a narrative text. In the second interval. pauses were longer in L1 than in L2, but only for the argumentative genre. As mentioned before, students paused more frequently in interval 2 when working on a narrative task compared to an argumentative task. This genre diffrence was only significant for L1. Pauses in interval 2 were shorter for the narrative tasks, but only in L1.

Lower order pauses. For within-word pause frequency (higher i L2 than in L1), the language difference was only observed for the argumentative gere. The difference i between-word pause frequency and duration between1 and 2 (i.e, more frequent and longer in L2 than i L1) was larger for the argumentative tasks than for the narrative tasks. The difference between the geres in within-word pause frequency (higher for the argumentatie genre than for the narratie genre) was only observed in L2 writing. There was also a genre difference for between-word pause frequency (more pause for the narrative gere), but this was only observed in1, not in 2.

Production speed. In the beginning of the writing process thedifference in production speed btweenthe two languages (i., higher fluency in L1 than in L2) was larger when students wrote an argumentative text than when they wrote a narrative text. In addition, the observation that text production in the beginning of the writing process was more fluent in the case of argumentative writing was significant only for L1 writing.

# 5.2. Effective writing process patterns

We conducted multiple regression analyses to address the main aim of this study, namely exploring the relation between the writing process and the quality of the text. Given that the mixed model (see Section 5.1) showed that language and text type had an effect on the majority of the process variables under study, we carried out the multiple regression analyses on each of the four subsets searately In this way, we could identify the most efective proces pattern for argumentative texts in L1 (RQ3), narrative texts in L1 (RQ4), argumentative texts in L2 (RQ5), and narrative texts in L2 (RQ6).

The four models were built using the enter method in spss. To decide which variables to include in the first models as predictor variables, correlation analyses were conducted for each of the four subsets. Process variables correlating with text quality were included as predictors in the first models. In this way, 23 predictor variables were included in model 1 for the argumentative texts in Swedish, 17 predictors for narrative texts in Swedish, 23 predictors fr argumentative texts in English, and 21 predictors for narrative texts in English.

These first models contained a large set of predictor variables so other models containing les predictors were tested. We aimed to find a sparse model with a reduced set of predictor variables (process variables) that could significantly predict text quality. To determine which variables are contributors to a regression model, itis rather common to perform multiple and separate test, and to only retain those predictors with a significant $p$ -value (Mundfrom et al., 2006). In order to then control for Type-I errors, usually a Bonferroni corrction isused. However, tests based on this approach with Bonferroni adjustment proved to be overly conservative (Mundfrom et al., 2006). We therefore adopted a model-building approach in which we not only relied on the variables' $p$ -values to decide which predictors to retain or to drop from the model, but rather based the predictors selection on a combination of several parameters.

For this model-building aproach, step by step, adaptations were made to reduce the number of predictor variables and to improve the model, taking into account: (1) the ignificance f contribution of each predictor to the model, (2) the weight of each predictor in the model (B value), (3) multicollinearity (VIF statistics, low to moderate), (4) the adjusted $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ and (5) the significance of the overall model (Mortelmans & Dehertogh, 2007).

This resulted in four models with effective process patterns predicting text quality. Table 3 summarises the results. Appendix A provides the statistics for the coefficients of the four regression models.

# 5.2.1. L1 Argumentative

The regression analysis resulted in a model with four predictors explaining $6 3 . 7 \%$ of the variance in text quality of argumentative texts written in L1 (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 6 3 7 , F ( 4 , 1 2 9 ) = 5 9 . 2 9 , p < . 0 0 1$ . All four predictors significantly predicted text quality: total process time ( $\mathrm { \beta } = . 5 4$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ , mean time of pauses in the first interval $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \cdot } \mathrm { \{ } =  - . 3 3$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ , number of keystrokes per minute in interval 2 $( \beta = . 2 2$ $p = 0 . 0 0 2 )$ , and number of keystrokes per minute in interval 3 ( $\mathrm { \beta } = . 1 7$ $p = . 0 0 3 )$

# 5.2.2. L1 - Narrative

Results showed that text quality of narrative texts written in L1 could be predicted by five variables (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 5 6 1$ $F ( 5 ,$ $1 1 6 ) = 3 1 . 8 8$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ . The following five predictors explained $5 6 . 1 \ \%$ of the variance in text quality: total process time $( \beta = . 5 7 _ { \mathrm { { i } } }$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ , proportion of pause time $( \beta = . 2 6 , p = . 0 2 9 )$ , number of keystrokes per minute in interval : $2 ( \beta = . 4 4 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , duration of normal production $( \beta = . 4 7 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , and duration of insertions ( $\mathrm { \beta } = . 3 8$ $p < . 0 0 1 $

# 5.2.3. L2 - Argumentative

Regression analysis for argumentative writing in L2 resulted in a model with five variables explaining $6 9 . 3 ~ \%$ of the variance in text quality (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 6 9 3 , F ( 5 , 1 2 6 ) = 6 0 . 1 8 , p < . 0 0 1$ . Five variables significantly predicted text quality: total process time $( \beta = . 6 0 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , proportion of pause time $\mathrm { \Delta } \cdot \mathrm { \{ } = \cdot  4 1$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ , mean number of characters typed in P-bursts $( \beta = . 9 8 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ number of P-bursts per minute ( $\mathrm { \beta } = . 6 2$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ , and mean time of pauses within words $( \beta = - . 1 2 , p = . 0 3 7 )$

# 5.2.4. L2 - Narrative

Results showed that the text quality of narrative texts written in L2 could be predicted by four variables (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 6 4 7 , F ( 4 ,$ $1 2 9 ) = 6 1 . 8 3 $ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ . The following predictors explained $6 4 . 7 \%$ of the variance in text quality: total process time $( \beta = . 6 8 ,$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ , mean time of pauses in interval 2 ( $\beta = - . 2 5$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ , number of keystrokes per minute in interval 1 $\mathrm { \beta } = . 2 9$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ and relative number of pauses between words $( \beta = - . 2 1$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 $

# 6. Discussion

The main aim of this study was to explore efective writing process patterns for different languages (L1-Swedish and L2-English) and different text types (argumentative and narrative) among upper-secondary students in Sweden. We started by identifying sig nificant writing proces variables related to language and text type. In ths firs ste, we used mixed effects models to map students argumentative and narrative writing processes in L1 and L2.

The results of the mixed effects model analysis showed that students adopt a dfferent writing process depending on the language in which they write and the type of text they write In general, students spent more of the time pausing during writing when they wrote in L2 and when they wrote argumentative texts. This is in line with previous studies who found that students display longer and more frequent pausing both on a higher and lower-order level when writing in L2 (Spelman Miler, 200; Chukharev-Hudilainen et al., 2019) and in argumentative genres (Medimorec & Risko, 2017). A lower writing fluency in L2 is related to the greater cognitive demand of writing in a foreign language (Lindgren & Sulivan, 2006) and more uncertainty about or attention to lower-level processing (for example, word formation and spelling) (Spelman Miller, 200. The results of the present study may add a piectothe puzzleastothe relation between pause time and genre and how this relation may refect the development from knowledge-tlling to knowledge-transforming strategies in writing (Olive et al., 2009). Given that the total pause time was higher in the argumentative genre, this may suggest that the upper-secondary students in this study had implemented knowledge-transforming strategies (Olive et al., 2009; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1987) and were thereby able to process narration and argumentation dierently. In addition, significant interaction effects between language and genre, in particular concerning the frequency and location of higher- and lower-order pauses illustrate how different combinations of genre and language impact on students' pausing during writing, producing different patterns of pausing.

Language and genre efects were also found for revision-related variables. Students deleted more characters and spent more time on these deletions in L2 compared to L1. These results confirm several previous studies showing that writers revise more when they use a second language for writing (Silva, 1993; Thorson, 2000; Stevenson et al., 2006). Further, the mixed model analysis showed that text type impacted on student rursivenes during writing. I the narrative nre, they prodced more text at the leading edgei.., point of inscription at the end of the text produced so far) and made more deletions, while they inserted characters away from the leading edge more in the argumentative genre. Severinson Eklundh and Kollberg (2003) also found differences in writers recursiveness depending on the text type, where decriptive tasks generated more linear text and argumentative tass more recursiveness as writers needed to move back and forth to delop the argument. In our study, witers similarly responded to the genre requirements indicating an awareness of genres and their differences.

The main analyses of the current study (i.e, regression models explored which writing process pterns were positively related to text quality. Results showed that one variable, time on task, was positively connected with text quality, regardless of text type and language. Thus, those who spent more time on their writing task also received higher scores on their text, afinding in line with previous writing proces studies (Bennet et al., 2020). As inharay et al. (2019 suggest, a higher total omposition time might be an indicator of more effort.

For other aspects of the writing processthan time on task,different patterns of effctive writing were observed for writing in the two text types and two languages. This implie that writers who managedto produce a higher qualit text adapted thir writing process to text type and to what language they were using.

Those who achieved a high text quality in the argumentative texts in Swedish, had rather short pauses at the beginning of the writing process, and their writing in the middle and towards the end of the writingsesion was fluent. This might indicate that writers who wrote fast throughout the writing processalso had rapid acess to the translation of ideas into text. To some extent, the argu. mentative writing task provided contents for the task, and writers were expected to produce arguments and put them together in a logical and argumentative structure. Thus, the results may also indicate that high performing writers had internalised the task schema for the argumentative genre and could acess the structure of the text rapidy. In sum, the effective process pattern for an argu. mentative text in L1 was mainly characterised by a high fluency. In many studies, fluency is identified as the main indicator of text quality (Allen et al., 2016; Leijten & Van Waes, 2015; Sinharay et al., 2019).

Similar to the L1 argumentativetask, the L1 narrative task was characterised by fluent text production in the middle of the proces. Further, th high performing students not only wrot for a high amount of time at the leading edge, but they also took their time to go back into their previously written text to insert new passages. Though this indicates a rather productive behaviour, pausing was also substantial. This writing process patern reflects a combination of planning, production, and revising, which are high-level skills typically related to writers displaying a certain level of cognitive maturity (Limpo et al., 2014).

Those who achieved a high text quality in the English argumentative texts were those writers who paused for long time over the entire writing proces, though not within words. They produced words rather fluently as the within word pauses were hort Moreover, these students paused frequently but they also produced long strings of text between their pauses. If bursts are understood as indicating the translation of ideas into strings of language (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001), this means that students who had rapid accessto both ideas and to vocabulary and grammar in English also produced texts that were rated higher in terms of text quality. Further, the fact that this efective pattern for writing an argumentative text in L2 is marked by fluent word production is not surprising as previous studies have shown that pauses within words are typically connected with transcription demands such as spelling (Barkaoui, 2019; Spelman Miller, 2000; Wengelin, 2007).

Students who wrote a high-qualit text in the narrative task in English, wrote particularly fluently in the first part of the writing session, and they only paused for short moments in the middle of the writing session. They did not pause frequentl between words. Thus, compared to the students who paused more often between words, they experienced les dificulties with lexical access (such as spelling and word retrieval) and sentence planning (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Guo et al., 2018). Additionally, we know from previous studies that fluent text production, indicated by a high witing sped and short pauses, is indicative for fluen idea generation and translation (Chenoweth & Hayes, 2001; Chukarev-Hudilainen et al., 2019; Revesz et al., 2017).

# 6.1. Limitations and future directions

Though we believe this study's findings both confirm and add to previous studies on writing processes, there are some limitations. First, only one task was administered for every language-genre combination. This decision was driven by practical considerations as a balance had to be found between the time invested by schoos and students, and our research design. dell, students should complete multiple tass for each language-gere combination as previous studies argued that more than one task is needed to generalise findings and to get a valid and reliable view of a student's writing skills (van den Bergh et al., 2012).

Secondly, our findings were mainly related to production speed and pausing on both higher and lower order levels. These variables are strongl relat th broadr oncet f fluecy.  i rmarkable h for th effctive wiing patens, vry fw effcs related to revision were found. This i rson to relect on the revision measures used. Should other measures e used i rsion not decisive for the population in our study, or should revision be mapped differently? Keystroke logging studies focusing on revision behaviour frequently adopt more in-depth approach looking at types and locations of revisions (Baaijen e l., 2012; Lindgren & Sullivan, 2006). It might thus be that the revision measures used in this study are too general.

Thirdly, due to technical limitations, not all the variables used in the current study are interval-based. Given the importance of temporal distribution of proces activities, it would be beneficial if, in the future, it would be possible to obtain automatic data from keylogging programmes that allow calculation of all processfeatures per interval (such as the revision and lower-order pause variables).

Lastly, future studies might consider testing students' proficiency and include this as a co-variable.

# 6.2. Conclusion and implications

By studying several writing behavioural measures related to timing, production, pausing, and revision, we were able to map how students write different types of texts in different languages. Our results showed how students respond to different requirements related to language and genre by employing different pausing, revision, and recursiveness patterns. Moreover, by combining areduced set of process measures, we identified how effective writing process pattrns that resulted in higher qualit texts varied between languages and text types. These patterns explained a rather substantial part of the variance in text quality (more precisely, between $5 6 . 1 \ \%$ and $6 9 . 3 \ \%$ , affirming the important relation between the writing process and the writing product.

This study contributes to the current field of writing proces studies by expanding our knowledge of typical and effective writing processes in argumentative and narrative writing in upper-secondary students' L1 and L2 writing. These insights can be used to promote the implementation of ystematic writing education (e., Harri et al., 2013) that supports students in their development of strategies necessary for effective writig in dferent languages and text types. Strategy instruction could be implementedto explicitly teach student effctive plnning and revising trategie (Graham & Perin, 2007; Philippakos, 2020). Morover, this study supports the idea of incorporating genre-based writing instruction in the writing class (Hyland, 2007).

More concretely, when offering strategy instruction to students, educators could target effective processes for the specific writing task at hand. For example, inthe L1 writing classand when carrying out an argumentative task, we sugest supporting students fluent idea generation with mind-mapping, or brainstorming (with peers) during the pre-writing phase. In this way students can limit their pausing time in the beginning of the proces and focus on text production in the middle part of the process.In a class on narrative L1 writing, our findings suggest that planing strategies (atthe start) and revision strategie (at the end) might benefit students' writing. We can also formulate some recommendations for the L2 writing class Teachers could focus n supporting the translation of ideas into language by, for example, listing vocabulary in the pre-writing phase, providing a list with linking words, or sentence-combining instruction (Graham & Perin, 2007). Another option for L2 writing intruction is to support students in strategicall implementing (Al) language toos so that they can focus on planning, ide translation, and fluent text production rather than on spelling, grammar, and word-related problems.

In identifying effctive writing proces patterns for different types of writing tass in differen languages, our study can also inspire process-oriented feedback on writing. A frequentl used activity in proces-oriented feedback is comparison with other processes (Vandermeulen, 2024) By comparing and contrasting writing proceses, students are stimulated to reflect on their own writing process approach. In this context, it has proven beneficial to select example processes that demonstrate efective writing approaches. The results of this study can guide the selection of effective writing process examples that are text type- and language-dependent.
