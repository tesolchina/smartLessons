# JEAP - BALEAP News

We interrupt our news about the various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for a special message from Susie Cowley-Haselden about the 2023 BALEAP biennial conference:

The conference will be hosted by the EAP team at The University of Warwick from Wednesday April 19th to Friday April $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ , 2023. The title of the conference is:

# Caution! EAP under DEconstruction

The theme

While in the midst of working on a pre-sessional course, it has been hard to find the quiet time to write about the conference. Not just a physical lack of noise, but some mental quiet and focus to be able to articulate why we have chosen the theme we have, something more eloquent than the organising team feel now is a good time to give EAP a kick up the proverbial! To focus, I need music. So, air pods in (other brands are available), I am poised before a blank screen … for some time. New Model Army is a go to band for me at times like these. Then Spotify delivers ‘Smalltown England’ (New Model Army, 1984) with the lyrics:

Is it a crime to want something else?

Is it a crime to believe in something different?

Is it a crime to want to make things happen?

This. This is why we have chosen the theme we have. So often, events within our community, seem to perpetuate the status quo; we seem to focus on the same issues and hear from the same voices and little, if anything, ever really seems to change.

And this week’s going to be just the same

And the next and the next, again and again

For my colleague, Sanchia, the key to this conference are the questions, “Why do we do what we do?” and “Why do we keep doing it?” I would add, “And what are we going to do about it?” Our hope with this conference is that we encourage a critical look at every aspect of EAP. We hope that the community will feel bold and brave enough to challenge the status quo, offering ideas, opinions, research, practices, suggestions, and polemics that can take the field in new directions (something else, something different).

We want to host a conference that is by, as well as for, the EAP community. We hope to hear new voices, offering perspectives on how we might break with tradition and disrupt norms. We particularly welcome contributions from around the globe, precariously employed practitioners, those working on the fringes of EAP, and those who have never ‘presented’ before. Therefore, we will not be inviting key-note speakers to deliver plenaries, and we are encouraging potential participants to suggest their own formats and conference genres. We want to take a critical look at EAP from a grass roots position.

This conference will not be an intellectually ‘safe’ space. ‘Safe’ suggests being comfortable, unadventurous, uncontroversial. This conference will be a space where we ask participants to be brave, not safe. We encourage you to be brave and share your visions of how the field might be dismantled and reconstructed.

We are looking to generate a seismic shift in our understanding of what EAP is and what it could be.

…Nothing ventured, nothing gained…
