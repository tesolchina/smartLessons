# Interpersonal metadiscourse: an indicator of interaction and identity

R E Z A A B D I A R D E B I L A Z A D U N I V E R S I T Y, I R A N

A B S T R AC T By using genre analysis, this study investigates the way writers use interpersonal metadiscourse to partly reveal their identity and examines their selected mode of interaction in two major academic fields: the social sciences (SS) and natural sciences (NS). A total of 55 academic research articles from the SS and NS were selected as the corpus of this study. A comparison of the two disciplines was made, based on the use of interpersonal metadiscourse through ‘hedges’, ‘emphatics’ and ‘attitude markers’. The analysis showed that the SS writers employed interpersonal metadiscourse more frequently than the NS writers. One-to-one comparison further showed that they varied significantly in their use of hedges and attitude markers but there was little difference in their use of emphatics. However, the use of hedges and emphatics was significantly different within each discipline. A qualitative in-depth analysis revealed that the choice of validity markers was closely related to the type of article being studied.

K E Y WO R D S : genre analysis, interpersonal metadiscourse, linguistic behaviour

# Introduction

Social and cultural trends of human societies are revealed through language, discourse and communication (Van Dijk et al., 1997). Linguistic communication is achieved through linguistic behaviour; however, the options for linguistic behaviour are derived from three macro-functions of language; ideational, interpersonal and textual (Halliday, 1978, 1985). Cheng and Steffensen (1996) maintain that options in the ideational system concern the content of text and are informational, referential and representational. Options in the interpersonal system enable language users to establish interpersonal relations and interact with their audience. Language in this function allows users to express personal feelings about the ideational content of their texts. Options in the textual system are employed to add emphasis.

Halliday’s classification lays the theoretical foundation for the concept of metadiscourse. According to Vande Kopple (1985), primary discourse fulfils the ideational function and metadiscourse serves the interpersonal and textual functions of language.

Metadiscourse is a rhetorical means that is subjective and, as such, is more culture bound. Therefore, the investigation of interpersonal metadiscourse markers may be of some value in finding out underlying cultural constraints. This issue can be discussed generally and specifically. In general terms, one language is compared to another; in specific terms, on the other hand, different genres of a specific language can be compared with each other to come up with a more detailed description of a language. The specific approach therefore has the advantage of helping to discover a variety of identities for speakers of a specific language.

In 1966, Kaplan introduced contrastive rhetoric and stated that the linguistic background and cultural traditions of ‘English as a foreign language’ (EFL) writers influence the way they write. This influence persists even when EFL writers attain a good command of a target language. The contrastive analysis of rhetoric is offered as an approach for revealing the differences in interactions between speakers of different languages which could provide material for textual analysis. Kaplan (1987) believes this may help foreign students to form standards of judgement consistent with the demands made upon them by the system of the target language. Kaplan’s approach can be used to find out whether there are different standards of judgement within different genres and areas of a specific language.

Metadiscourse is recognized as one of the important rhetorical features and strategies in the production of any piece of discourse (Chambliss and Garner, 1996; Hyland, 1996, 1998). The first comprehensive functional classification of metadiscourse was introduced by Vande Kopple (1985). He suggested two main categories for metadiscourse: textual and interpersonal. Textual metadiscourse, sometimes called metatext (Bunton, 1999; Mauranen, 1993), serves the function of organizing the text and directing the reader and fulfils Halliday’s textual function. Interpersonal metadiscourse is employed to develop the relationship between the reader and the writer and to add the writer’s personal belief and degree of commitment toward an ongoing proposition (Cheng and Steffensen, 1996).

Interpersonal metadiscourse tends to play an important role in metadiscourse features since, according to Vande Kopple, it is the precise layer of the text in which the writer’s personal intrusion into his or her text adds emotional flavour and demonstrates the degree of commitment toward the ongoing proposition (Vande Kopple, 1985). The quality and quantity of interpersonal metadiscourse markers are shown to be different in different genres. Genre analysis is employed in the field of ‘English for specific purposes’ (ESP) (Bhatia, 1993) to discover more specificities. According to Coe (1998) and Bazzerman (1998), genres are conventionally accepted norms of dealing with any speech event. These conventions are specified ways of interacting with the audience which, whilst deemed inappropriate in other circumstances, bear testimony to the diversity of speakers’ linguistic identities, both interculturally and intraculturally.

# Method

Following Grabe (1987) and Paltridge (1996), the three criteria of genre, ESP and text type were utilized for the selection of the corpus required for this study. Many scholars such as Swales (1981, 1990), Mauranen (1993) and Connor (1996), have argued that research articles can be taken as a genre. So, research articles were chosen to meet the first criterion. The research articles of this study were limited to the social sciences (SS) and the natural sciences (NS) to meet the second criterion: ESP. A further reason for this limitation was the quality of systematic research procedure that these articles enjoy. Furthermore, since the discussion section is the very part of the research article in which researchers try to persuade their readers, the study was further confined to discussion sections as a persuasive text type to meet the third criterion. Persuasive text type is a better context for the realization of interpersonal metadiscourse.

In the definitions of genre by Coe (1998), Bazzerman (1998) and Widdowson (1998), the time factor is also very important because, as Miller (1998) pointed out, genres change, evolve and decay. To take care of the time factor, all texts culled for this purpose were chosen from among articles published in 1999.

A total of 40 SS and NS research journals were randomly selected from among several hundred journals; 60 research articles were then randomly selected, 30 from each discipline. The discussion sections were extracted and then five SS articles were discarded to balance the length of the texts for the two fields.

Three subcategories of emphatics, hedges and attitude markers – as classified by Vande Kopple (1985) – were selected, and their possible lexical and phrasal realizations with possible ambiguities and various functions were taken into account. The selected markers were then checked by Dr A. Crismore from Indiana University.

The analysis was conducted with rigorous consideration of the functional meaning. As Crismore (1990), Crismore et al. (1993), Salager-Meyer (1994, 1998), Crompton (1997, 1998) and Halliday (1985) argued, metadiscourse marking is not confined exclusively to certain features. A structure used as a hedge in one context can serve another function somewhere else. In order to reach a valid result, these authors suggested functional analysis to rigorously determine interpersonal metadiscourse marking. Furthermore, since a single judgement was deemed to be inadequate for identifying interpersonal metadiscourse markers, three experts reviewed the data and the corpus and the results were averaged out to yield one more reliable set of data.

# Results and discussion

Interpersonal metadiscourse is an indicator of the attempts made by writers to create an interaction with their reader, reach their audience and express their own truth-value judgments about the ongoing proposition. The more interpersonal the nature of the metadiscourse markers used in a text, the more the writer of the text intends to achieve these goals. The results can be seen in Table 1.

The findings of this study suggest different identities for NS and SS authors. Authors of SS articles tend to intervene in the current of information more than NS authors. This is probably because NS writers do not feel as much need to reach their audience and add a subjective flavour to their representational information.

The use of hedges also turned out to be significantly different in the two major fields: SS authors displayed more uncertainty than NS writers about the ongoing proposition. Perhaps this is related to the nature of the two fields. Since NS writers always report empirical and objectively observable phenomena, some of the uncertainty is removed.

Emphatics were not employed significantly differently by either NS or SS authors. The qualitative in-depth analysis revealed that emphasized propositions were not always assertions about the plausibility and thoroughness of the findings as these may provoke a negative defensive reaction in readers and present the authors in a rather arrogant light. Conversely, emphatics are mostly used to show the writer’s humility and the insufficiency of the study in exhausting the phenomenon under study, as in the following examples:

Quite clearly, the results of this study are preliminary and will need replication and refinement. (SS)

We intend to introduce it as clearly and completely as possible. (SS)

Clearly this discussion is somewhat speculative. (NS)

Now, consider these examples:

Indeed, efforts at recruitment must be accompanied by a clear view of why the program needs teachers of color, in the first place. (SS)

This paper is unique in demonstating that . . . (NS)

Here, emphatics are used to emphasize the proposition, which is well evidenced and almost certain, but uncertain enough to qualify as a naked proposition without metadiscourse. Metadiscourse used in this way adds an authoritative element to the article.

The use of attitude markers (which was only $7 \%$ of the total interpersonal metadiscourse) also showed statistically significant differences between NS and SS writers. Attitude markers were used more frequently by SS than NS writers to express their subjective stance towards the information being presented. Perhaps, this is again related to the different characters of the two fields. SS writers feel free to express their own feelings, while NS writers prefer to sidestep such emotions in order to preserve the scientific nature of their information.

The comparison of the hedges and emphatics within the two fields showed that hedges are employed significantly more than emphatics in both fields. Academics use hedging more often than emphatics to represent their findings. Hedges are used for those propositions where writers appeal to the judgement of their readers, which is a means of interacting with their audience.

On the whole, this study suggests that interpersonal metadiscourse markers are valuable rhetorical means through which different identities can be presented. It further demonstrates that there are differences in the nature of SS and NS propositions, which require authors to employ the markers appropriately. Also, in-depth field analyses confirmed that it is the type and nature of the articles being studied that determine the choice of interpersonal metadiscourse. In addition, the considerable use of hedges and emphatics in both fields show that they are valuable rhetorical means (Hyland, 1996, 1998, 1999).

# Implications and applications

The most important implication of this study is that general cultural typologies (see Brown, 1993) are not valid for a specific language. Generic differences, the ensuing varieties of what I call ‘generic identities’ and the different modes of interaction denote that there are several different cultural typologies for speakers of a single language, which cannot be lumped into a single framework. The findings of this study can be used by sociolinguists as evidence of the existence of a variety of verbal subcultures and/or linguistic identities.

Previous studies have acknowledged the need for validated data concerning different strategies for teaching in specific contexts (Bernadette, 1994; Cheng and Steffensen, 1996; Varttala, 1998). The quantitative and qualitative results of this study provide updated authentic data for writing classes.

In the three models of course design in ESP – language-centred, skill-centred and learning-centred, as discussed by Hutchinson and Waters (1987) – the provision of authentic materials for specific contexts plays an important role. On the other hand, Dudley-Evans (1994) and Paltridge (1996) believe that authentic materials for course design are derived from genre analysis. The findings of this study should help to feed into the process of designing relevant and authentic course material.
