# ABSTRACT

Machine Translation (MT) tools have advanced to a level of reliability such that it is now opportune to consider their place in language teaching and learning. Given their potential, the current study sought to engage EFL university sophomores in recursive editing afforded by Google Translate (GT) for one semester, and investigated (1) whether the students were able to correct errors assisted by GT, (2) whether GT facilitated better writing, (3) which aspects of writing, fluency, complexity or accuracy GT better assisted the learners with, and (4) the student’s attitudes toward GT. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted where the experimental group, comprising 34 students, received training in recursive editing while the control group, comprising 33 students, did not. Both groups completed an error-correction test and an essay pre- and post-intervention. The experimental group completed an additional Affective Filter and Task Difficulty questionnaire post-intervention. The results showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group on the error correction test; however, no significant difference in the two groups’ writing scores was found. Further, the evaluation of writing fluency, accuracy, and complexity yielded a mixed picture. The control group demonstrated significantly better fluency as shown in sentence, clause, and T-unit counts, but not in total word count. The experimental group, conversely, showed significantly higher syntactic complexity in mean length of clause, and significantly better accuracy in writing post-intervention. Finally, the students were generally positive about using GT to learn in terms of anxiety, motivational belief, and task complexity.

# 1.  Introduction

Driven by Artificial Intelligence, modern Machine translation (MT) is largely statistically based, as it ‘calculates probabilities of various translations of a phrase being correct, rather than aiming for word-forword translation’ (Groves & Mundt, 2015, p. 113). In light of this, as long as the database hosts a sufficiently large amount of data, precision is likely to be attained. Since 2016, Google has utilized Neural Machine Translation which works ‘based on the content of the entire sentence as opposed to parts of the sentence’ (Briggs, 2018, p. 5). This has allowed Google Translate (GT) to substantially improve its performance. Popović (2021) found that compared to other MTs, GT is strongest in producing comprehensible and fairly adequate (i.e., conveying the meaning of the original texts) outputs. Ducar and Schocket (2018) posited that GT has developed to the extent that it can handle high-frequency idioms instead of simply producing literal translations. Post-2016, the issues that persist have been narrowed down to only three: grammatical inaccuracies, register, and pragmatic breakdown, largely caused by GT’s inability to understand the larger contextual and cultural meanings, which are no less challenging for language learners. This is not surprising as GT does not understand but simply processes language, and therefore, does not consider ‘context, connotation, denotation, register, and culture’ (Ducar & Schocket, 2018, p. 785). Still, Stapleton and Leung Ka Kin (2019) have pointed out that GT can now produce translations comparable to those produced by humans. Kessler (2018) urged that given the capacity of MT tools, ‘it is now necessary to consider new ways to fit them into our teaching contexts’ (p. 214). An emphasis on using MT to ‘find meaning and understanding and less on accuracy’ is on the rise, given its potential to facilitate problem-solving, discussion, and even debate (Josefsson, 2011, p. 3).

However, as there are still areas in which MT fails, it may better be considered a tool to drive learning, with its outputs serving as usable or teachable learning materials (Groves & Mundt, 2015). This would harness the capabilities of MT to create learning opportunities for students (Ducar & Schocket, 2018; Kessler, 2018) and to facilitate independent language learning (Niño, 2020). MT encourages collaboration and learner centeredness, and allows learners more control over what they learn. MT may benefit beginners in terms of communicating more in writing, and high proficiency learners in terms of offloading cognitive energy to concentrate on post-editing to produce more precise meanings (García & Pena, 2011; Groves & Mundt, 2015).

Another issue under debate concerns how to draw the line between plagiarism and original works. Works produced by accessing MT are often considered ‘derived’ works, which might not be ‘original’ (Somers et  al., 2006). While this may ring true, the Internet has enabled unlimited access to all sorts of sources, materials, and texts which students can easily access and use. Given that banning the use of MT in the classroom has been ineffective and is unrealistic, training in appropriate use and more constructive approaches should be sought to optimize the use of GT for language learning (Briggs, 2018).

Despite rich discussions related to the use of MT in language learning, evidence derived from the actual language teaching and learning scene is scant. There is also a need to move beyond subjective approaches and error analysis in investigating the potential of MT. To optimize its potential, instruction in both pre- and post-editing is a must (Giannetti, 2016). Without training, students may directly borrow the outputs and not learn from them, which further consolidates the link of MT use to plagiarism. Of the few studies, Cancino and Panes (2021) have demonstrated that the absence of both GT and instruction put the EFL students at grave disadvantage compared to the other two groups granted access to GT. However, the two groups (i.e. GT with and without training) did not exhibit significant difference in writing after 90-min instruction. In light of the study, the current study, therefore, sought to zero in on the effect of instruction involving recursive editing on GT, and extended the timespan to an 18-week semester. The study investigated (1) EFL university students’ performance on an error-correction test assisted by GT, (2) their writing performance pre- and post-instruction, (3) fluency, complexity, and accuracy in their writing, and (4) their attitudes toward the use of GT in terms of anxiety, motivational beliefs, and task difficulty.

# 2.  Literature review

Conceptual discussions related to the weaknesses and strengths of MT in language learning are plentiful. The discussions have considerably centered on the reliability of MT, which has often led scholars to conclude that MT is not reliable; for example, it fails to perform satisfactorily at discourse level (Lee, 2020). Conversely, MT has also been reported to facilitate the acquisition of both vocabulary and grammatical structures, enhance understanding of use in context, generate a convincing and formal academic style, raise awareness of the cultural distance between the L1 and L2, facilitate independent language learning, and boost confidence (Groves & Mundt, 2015; Kelly & Bruen, 2015; Valijärvi & Tarsoly, 2019).

Empirical studies examining learning with MT are, however, far from sufficient. An often investigated topic involves pre- or post-editing using MT. Pre-editing requires learners to modify their L1 input prior to translation via MT. Post-editing refers to ‘the modification of the source text until appropriate MT output is obtained’ (Niño, 2009, p. 3). The process is, therefore, recursive, involving multiple rounds of edits by way of inversed translation. Inverted translation is a term used in

Cancino and Panes (2021) to mean ‘translating from the L1 to the L2 and vice versa’ with the aim of ‘check[ing] if the inversed translation was accurate in the L1’ (p. 5). In the current study, the process was meant to scaffold the comparison of cross-linguistic differences and hypothesis-testing of different meaning units between the target and the native language. Niño (2008) investigated MT post-editing in a foreign language (FL) classroom and employed error analysis to extract patterns of error to improve students’ grammatical and lexical accuracy. The students in the post-editing group showed marked improvement in their output, in terms of lower number of errors made. Of the types of errors, only ‘differences in spelling’ exhibited a significant difference between the two groups. Niño (2020) surveyed 37 college students about the usefulness of MT in facilitating independent language learning and had the students engage in MT-assisted language learning tasks in a $^ { 2 \mathrm { - h } }$ class. It was claimed that the advanced students became aware of the strengths and limitations of MT, and that the tasks enhanced metalinguistic reflection.

Specifically regarding how MT aids writing performance, Giannetti (2016) explored the potential of Online Translation (OT) for assisting seventh-grade students’ writing in an FL classroom, evaluated by error production. The students were found to reduce their syntactic and semantic errors and to write more. Fredholm (2015) examined essays written in Spanish as an FL by two groups of secondary school students. One group was allowed Internet access and used OT, while the other was not and did not. The group using OT showed significantly better writing quality in terms of fluency and complexity, but not in accuracy, in part confirming Giannetti (2016). Comparing EFL English major students’ L2 writing and GT-produced writing, Tsai (2019) concluded that GT produced better English texts with fewer errors in both lexical and grammatical aspects. Similarly, Stapleton and Leung Ka Kin (2019) also showed that GT improved students’ writing in terms of significantly better grammar, but not as much in vocabulary and comprehensibility (i.e., the clarity of the message). Lee (2020) had students compare their L2 writing and its parallel GT version, followed by editing using GT and other resources. Error analysis revealed that the students reduced their grammatical and lexical errors and improved their writing quality, but how the writing quality was evaluated was not mentioned. In addition, no significant difference was found in syntactic complexity.

Of the few studies which have investigated instruction associated with GT use, Cancino and Panes (2021) reported that both the GT with and without instruction groups, composed of 11th graders, performed better in such areas as syntactic complexity and accuracy in story writing than the no GT and no instruction group. Finally, O’Neill (2019) investigated the impact of an online dictionary and GT, with and without training, and the absence of both on second language writers’ scores. The training was administered on Google Form, which presented multiple-choice questions revolving around the strengths and weaknesses of GT, but did not involve post or recursive editing. It was found that the GT with training group scored the highest, followed by the dictionary with training group. Investigation of the delayed posttests indicated that without access to GT, students’ performance no longer distinguished itself. O’Neill (2019) concluded that while teachers may prohibit the use of GT in language learning, online translators actually aided learners to perform better than not using them, and that training may serve learners well.

More empirical evidence is needed to understand the potential of MT for facilitating language learning, and specifically writing. Much of the evidence so far has been derived from subjective reports such as questionnaires and interviews (Briggs, 2018; Josefsson, 2011; Kelly & Bruen, 2015; Martin, 2015; Niño, 2009). A majority of these studies also reported error analysis results and were limited to vocabulary and grammar, which failed to account for the potential of GT in assisting language learners to express larger chunks of meaning. While many scholars have stressed the importance of instruction related to GT use (Briggs, 2018; Cancino & Panes, 2021; Giannetti, 2016; Groves & Mundt, 2015), instruction was rarely introduced in most of the past studies. Of the few that did incorporate instruction, Cancino and Panes (2021) had students perform inversed translation by checking back and forth between the L1 and L2, similar to the current study. However, they did not mention whether the editing involved one shot and was linear, or whether there were multiple rounds. In addition, the instruction lasted $9 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ only, which may have limited impact on learning. Similarly, despite training offered in O’Neill’s (2019) study, it was mostly composed of multiple-choice questions exploring the weaknesses and strengths of GT, and did not engage the learners in post or recursive editing. Another study by Giannetti (2016) indicated that instruction was provided, but did not specify the content or duration.

The current study provided semester-long GT instruction to engage students in recursive editing, involving rounds of inversed translation. This approach was intended to engage their cognitive effort in deeper thinking and reflection with the aim of raising their metalinguistic awareness. The underlying theoretical assumption was informed by the Learning Sciences, a science founded on constructivism, cognitive science, educational technology, and sociocultural studies (Sawyer, 2014). Constructivism prioritizes active learning and construction of knowledge by the learners. Scaffold (Vygotsky, 1978) naturally accompanies such a learning approach which provides prompts and hints to learners ‘to figure it out on their own’ (Sawyer, 2014, p. 11). The use of GT was, therefore, meant to serve as a scaffold to aid students’ active learning through trials and errors, embodied in the recursive rounds of editing, aiming to stimulate thinking and reflection, central to Cognitive Science, a second foundation to the Learning Sciences theory mentioned above. Introducing GT also afforded opportunities for students to collaborate in proposing hypothesis and trialing and testing together, informed by the sociocultural theories of learning, another foundation underpinning the Learning Sciences.

Taken together, the variety of exercises and activities designed for the class were meant to encourage active learning. Through trialing and testing, they built their knowledge, albeit tentative and subject to challenge and refinement, through collaboration.

Additionally, while some recent studies expanded error analysis to explore more extended linguistic features of fluency, complexity, and accuracy, only a very limited range of these were investigated. The current study, therefore, also sought to expand the scope, both of the study design and analysis, of past research.

The following questions were addressed:

1. Which group, the GT-aided recursive editing group or the control group which received no training, performed better on the error correction task?   
2. How did the GT-aided recursive editing group and control group perform in the essay writing task? 2.1. Did the two groups improve in the post-intervention essays? 2.2. Which group performed better in the post-intervention essays? 2.3. How did the two groups differ in terms of their writing fluency, complexity, and accuracy post-intervention? 2.4. What improvement did the GT-aided recursive editing group make in the post-intervention writing?

3. How was the GT-aided recursive editing group’s attitude toward GT in terms of perceived anxiety, motivation, and task difficulty?

# 3.  Methods

# 3.1.  Participants

Two classes of non-English major sophomores in a university in Taiwan participated in this study. The experimental group had 34 students (26 females and 8 males) who received training in recursive editing, while the control group comprised 33 students (22 females and 11 males) who did not1 . Informed consent was obtained of all participants prior to the start of the experiment2 . The pre-intervention essay scores indicated that no significant difference was present between the groups to start with, $t ( 6 7 ) ~ = ~ 1 . 4 7 1$ , $p \ = \ . 1 4 6 > \ . 0 5$ . The experimental group received consistent training throughout a semester of 18 weeks on recursive editing afforded by GT while the control group was not.

# 3.2.  Instruction and procedure

In this English for Specific Purposes course, Education is the core content area, and the first author was also the instructor. The materials used included 10 TED talks and three essays on educational issues. For both the control and experimental groups, all of the materials adopted were the same. The main difference was the presence or absence of instruction related to using GT to do recursive editing through rounds of inversed translation. Given that Cancino and Panes (2021) have found that the two groups that had access to GT in writing (i.e. the GT/ no-training and GT/training groups) performed significantly better than the group without access and training, the current study, therefore, investigated the use of GT to write and zeroed in on the with and without instruction conditions, which did not exhibit significant difference in Cancino and Panes (2021) with 90-min instruction. Our study extended instruction to one semester with an aim to distinguish the effect of instruction on GT use. The decision against a strictly controlled condition where students are denied access to GT is also driven by concerns related to authenticity in language learning. A ‘purely’ controlled condition resembling a lab, we believe, fails to reflect learning as it actually occurs (Lagemann, 2002) as GT is omnipresent these days. Therefore, the main variable is intuitive use of GT like a dictionary, mostly lexically-based and linear, without instruction versus recursive editing, which prompts translation beyond lexis, informed by instruction.

The instruction was staged. The class started with an overview of GT’s current capacity and limitations in translation. The first few classes started with demonstration by the instructor of doing one-way translation (i.e., input-output), followed by post-editing, and flipping (i.e. switching the source text and the translated result) the translations for a few rounds to compare cross-linguistic differences. The last stage is considered recursive because every post-edited result becomes a new input, and the ‘new’ input will be subsequently refined if needed, building on a previous translation. This goes on until GT seems to reach its capacity of generating even better outputs. As mentioned earlier, recursive editing happens through rounds of inversed translation to scaffold the students to compare cross-linguistic differences and engage in hypothesis-testing, with an aim to enable noticing and raise metalinguistic awareness.

The instruction was also designed to facilitate thinking and exploration. For example, they were asked to translate sentences (both from Chinese to English and English to Chinese) by themselves first, and to compare their translations with GT’s, which triggered discussion (e.g., which version is better and why) and revision. Some typical exercises are presented below:

Example 1. One Google Doc:   
1. Express the following sentences in English:   
 學習的能力不是一成不變的, 它會由於你的努力發生變化。當孩 子們大腦在面對挑戰時, 會變化和成長。如此, 他們更有可能在 失敗時繼續堅持, 因為他們不相信他們永遠會失敗。顯然, 意志 力越堅定的孩子, 畢業的可能性明顯越高。   
2. Compare with GT   
3. Revise   
4. Look at others’ works & Pick the one you like by ticking ‘V’   
 Response by one group: [your translation]: The ability to learn is not in a rut, it will change because of your efforts. When children’s brains are facing challenges, they will change and grow. In this way, they are more likely to hang on when they fail, because they don’t believe they will always fail. Obviously, children’s grits are stronger, the possibility of graduation is higher. [GT’s]: The ability to learn is not static, it will change due to your efforts. When children’s brains face challenges, they will change and grow. In this way, they are more likely to continue to persevere when they fail, because they don’t believe they will always fail. Obviously, children with more determined willpower are more likely to graduate. [Revised by you]: Learning ability is not fixed. This will change through your efforts. When children’s brains face challenges, they change and grow. In this way, they are more likely to survive failure

because they do not believe that failure is permanent. Obviously, children with stronger perseverance are more likely to graduate.

Example 2. On Google Doc:

1. What’s wrong with the Chinese translation done by GT? Underline these expressions.   
 Based on research, quicker rewards make learning more rapid. This has many teachers toward the idea that learning should be a pleasant experience. However, we should not be too quick to apply this idea to us, who also can learn by reflecting on the things we have done!

2. Revise the Chinese and use GT to translate again. 3. Write down what you were thinking and doing in trying to deal with questions $1 \ \& \ 2$ . (Using Chinese is fine too)  Response by a group:

In addition, given the limitations of GT, exercises were also designed to stimulate thinking about its limitations. Some exercises in this light are presented here:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Your response [GT translation] jHc, 1 p7  1, 9TK1</td><td>What were you thinking?. I thought GT translate couldn&#x27;t segment the sentence, it couldn&#x27;t tell where the end of. the sentence was. Therefore, it might have. some misunderstanding of the original.</td></tr><tr><td>!(Underlined: problematic translation identified) [Post-editing] H, *</td><td>sentence.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Example 3. Turn the following sentences into Chinese using GT, and discuss what aspects (words, expressions, phrases, or even sentences) are difficult for GT.

 You seem intent to sacrifice the carefree years of childhood, and to fill them instead only with ways to advance their intellectual development. But intelligence is not the only thing that makes our lives worth living: what about love and companionship? Response by one group: 您似乎有意（寧可）犧牲無憂無慮的童年歲月, 而只以促進其智力 發展的方式來充實他們。 但是, 智力並不是使我們的生活賴以生 存的唯一事物, （更有意義的唯一價值）：那愛情和陪伴 呢？[Underlined: what GT cannot do; Parenthesis: students’ suggested translation]

Example 4. In the sentences below [shown on a Google Form], indicate the meanings or expressions that may pose challenges to GT?

Q3: 以下那些中文GT無法正確翻出？「千禧年前夕, 受到千禧蟲症候群影響, 各地銀行機關出現大排長龍的補登存摺人潮。

A. 千禧年  
B. 千禧蟲症候群  
C. 大排長龍  
D. 補登  
E. 存摺

After instructor modelling, every week a group of students led a discussion on using GT to translate based on the sentences sent by the instructor. In these discussions, debates and brainstorming were an integral part, given that GT is not perfect. The exercises and activities were meant to encourage learner centeredness where ‘the learner develops autonomy by exploring, experimenting … where the language teachers act as mere facilitators’ (Niño, 2020, p. 3). The exercises and peer discussion triggered teachable moments for the instructor to discuss syntactic differences between the languages, use of relative clauses in English, problems with literal translation, inappropriate use of pronouns, and issues with chunking, grammar, and wording/expression. Additionally, to motivate learning, some tasks were designed as competitions and rewards were given.

At the beginning and the end of the semester, the two groups completed an error-correction test taking $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . The test comprised three major sections: (1) 5 multiple choice questions (i.e., choosing correct sentences and identifying errors) accounting for $1 0 \%$ , (2) five questions which asked the students to identify and revise inappropriate expressions or erroneous sentences in English-Chinese translations, accounting for $2 0 \%$ , and (3) 10 questions to revise problematic issues in short passages of about two to three sentences in English, accounting for $7 0 \%$ . The issues range from lexical, grammatical, to semantic problems. The total score is 100. Sample questions are demonstrated in Appendix A. The test questions were verified by two experienced teachers and were modified based on their suggestions. A native speaking faculty member in a TESOL program was also consulted when called for.

The students also wrote pre- and post-intervention essays, comprising at least 150 words. Three topics were provided for the students to choose from so that they could better develop their ideas by writing on a topic of their interest, which may also enable us to see maximal use of GT. These three topics were filtered from a number of topics and were chosen based on five experienced English teachers’ recommendations, judged by relevancy and reasonable level of challenge. We believe that the three seemingly different topics not only converged in their close relevancy to the students’ collective experience, but also elicited responses from the students in terms of producing the same genre.

The topics are:

A. How frequently should we read the news? Why?   
B. Is face-to-face interaction with professors more effective than online sessions and lectures? Why or why not?   
C. Does living in a dorm help students assimilate into the college community? Why or why not?

Dictionaries were allowed for both groups, as they are a common and essential tool that EFL learners access throughout their language learning process.

# 3.3.  Data collection and analysis

The dataset included pre- and post-intervention error correction tests and essays and an additional Affective Filter and Task Difficulty questionnaire for the experimental group post-intervention. First, paired sample $t$ tests were administered to investigate the difference in performance on the error correction tests. Second, the essays were graded analytically and holistically based on the evaluation rubrics for English writing in the General Scholastic Ability Test, a national college entrance examination in Taiwan, which evaluates four main aspects: content, coherence and organization, vocabulary, and grammar (syntactic structure included), with a total score of 20. To avoid bias, the pre- and post-intervention essays, in total 135 essays, were blinded for scoring by two raters, the researcher and a doctoral student in TESOL who is also an experienced high school teacher. A strong level of interrater reliability was found, with respective interclass correlation coefficients for Content of .874, Coherence and Organization, .835, Vocabulary, .870, Grammar, .885, and total score, .930, suggesting that the scoring of the two raters was similar. An averaged total score for all of the essays was then obtained for further statistical analysis.

In addition to human rating, all of the essays were further analyzed for fluency, complexity, and accuracy. Fluency is defined as a ‘communicator’s ability to think, compose, and deliver language in real time’, which indicates his or her speed and automaticity in using language (Plakans et  al., 2019, p. 165). It was measured by overall word, sentence, T-unit, and clause counts in the current study, which are areas most consistently measured in L2 writing research (Plakans et  al., 2019). For complexity, multiple measures were investigated, including mean length of sentence (MLS), mean length of T-unit (MLT), mean length of clause (MLC), clause per sentence (C/S), verb phrase per T-unit (VP/T), clause per T-unit (C/T), dependent clause per clause (DC/C), dependent clause per T-unit (DC/T), T-unit per sentence (T/S), and complex T-unit ratio (CT/T). Both fluency and complexity were analyzed by running the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) (Lu, 2010). For accuracy, the ratio of error-free T-units to the total number of T-units in the students’ essays were calculated (Storch, 2009). Mechanical errors such as capitalization and punctuation were excluded, considering that these generally do not compromise comprehensibility. Inter-coder reliability on the identification of T-units and on error-free T-units of 1/5 of the total essays was $9 9 . 6 \%$ and $9 2 \%$ , respectively. Differences in coding were discussed and consensus was reached, enabling the first coder, that is, the first author, to move on and code the rest of the data. According to O’Connor and Joffe (2020), in inter-coder reliability, $1 0 { - } 2 5 \%$ of randomly selected data units is acceptable, and coding a subset of the dataset has advantage over coding the entire set for reaching better reliability; therefore, ‘it may be judicious to first double-code a small amount of data’ (p. 6).

Having obtained the scores for both the tests and essays, paired sample $t$ tests and ANCOVA analysis were conducted. A series of paired sample $t$ tests were performed to investigate within-group performance of the error correction tests and essay quality. To investigate between-group differences in error correction, essay quality and the fluency, complexity, and accuracy aspects of the essays, ANCOVA was conducted. In the ANCOVA models, the pretests were treated as covariates to control for the effect of their pre-intervention on their post-intervention performance. For all ANCOVA models, no significant interactions between covariates and group conditions (control or experimental group) were found $\left( p \ > \ . 0 5 \right)$ , indicating that the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes was met for all models.

Finally, given the potential of MT to lower the affective filter in language learning (Kliffer, 2005; Shei, 2002), the current study also investigated the participants’ attitude toward the learning experience assisted by GT. Three affective dimensions were included: perceived writing anxiety, motivational beliefs, and writing task difficulty. The questionnaire was adapted from Rahimi and Zhang’s Affective Filter and Task Difficulty Questionnaire on writing tasks (2019) by adding GT experience to the original version (Appendix B).

# 4.  Results

First, paired sample $t$ tests were administered to compare pre- and post-intervention error correction scores within group, and significant differences were found for both groups. For the control group, the scores increased significantly from the pre-intervention test $M = 4 0 . 4 1$ , $S D = 1 5 . 7 1 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ) to the post-intervention test $\mathit { M } = 4 6 . 5 5$ , $S D = 1 6 . 4 1 $ ), $t ( 3 1 ) =$ 3.80, $p = . 0 0 1$ . Similarly, for the experimental group, the post-intervention score $M = 4 9 . 0 1$ , $S D = 1 3 . 1 9$ ) was significantly higher than the pre-intervention score $( M = 3 7 . 5 9$ , $S D = 1 1 . 1 5 , $ ), $t ( 3 3 ) \ = \ 6 . 9 6$ , $\textstyle P \ < \ . 0 0 1$ . The experimental group also exhibited a higher effect size, .92 (Cohen, 1988), showing that the improvement considerably surpassed that of the control group. Table 1 presents the results of within-group performance.

One-way ANCOVA controlling for the pre-intervention score revealed that the experimental group did significantly better on the post-intervention test, $F { = } 4 . 5 5$ , $p = . 0 3 7 < . 0 5$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 6 7$ . Table 2 shows the difference in the post-intervention error-correction test scores.

Next, a paired sample $t$ test was conducted on the within-group essay scores. The results of the pre- and post-intervention essay performance are presented in Table 3. Both groups showed a significant increase in all measures of writing. For the experimental group, the total writing score significantly improved from the pre-intervention ( $M = 1 0 . 4 5$ , $S D = 3 . 4 2 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) to the post-intervention scores $M = 1 2 . 6 6$ , $S D = 3 . 3 8 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ ), $t ( 3 2 ) =$ 4.39, $\textstyle P \ < \ . 0 0 1$ . Similarly, for the control group, the post-intervention score $M = 1 1 . 9 4$ , $S D = 3 . 7 1$ ) was significantly higher than the pre-intervention score $\mathbf { \mathcal { M } } = 9 . 2 3$ , $S D = 3 . 5 9 \AA$ ), $t ( 3 1 ) = 5 . 5 5$ , $\hbar < . 0 0 1$ . Despite showing slightly higher effect size on the side of the control group, the numbers of both groups all fall in the medium effective size range (i.e. effect size 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively, designating small, medium and large effect size). The higher effect size of the control group can be explained by the consistently lower pretest writing scores this group started with.

However, no significant difference was found between the control and experimental groups in any of the writing measures or in the total score of the post-intervention essays, as shown in Table 4. This may be attributed to the fact that the response essay task required a holistic grasp of writing. Using GT to polish meanings is, however, often sentence bound, which may thus have limited impact on areas such as conceptualizing and organizing a writing task. Regardless, the recursive training on using GT also significantly improved the experimental group’s writing from the pretest, which suggests that GT did not harm but has potential to assist EFL students’ writing. More specific areas of writing where GT helped are reported below.

To pinpoint the advantages of recursive editing using GT to write, we further analyzed the three linguistic aspects in the writing, that is, accuracy, fluency, and complexity. First, a series of paired samples $t$ tests were performed to compare the within-group pre- and post-instruction differences. In both fluency and accuracy, both groups improved significantly from the pre-intervention essays $( p \ < \ . 0 1$ , Cohen’s d between 0.40 and 1.56); however, no significant improvement was found in complexity for either group $\left( p > . 0 5 \right)$ . Comparing the two groups revealed that the control group demonstrated significantly better fluency in the mean number of sentences, clauses, and T-units $\left( p \textless . 0 0 1 \right)$ but not in total words in the post-intervention essays $\left( p \ : = \ : . 0 6 9 \right)$ . Table 5 presents the results.

Regarding syntactic complexity, the experimental group showed significantly higher complexity in mean length of clause (MLC), $F { = } 4 . 0 4 3$ , $\textit { p } < \ . 0 5$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } ~ = ~ . 0 6 2$ , while the rest of the complexity indices investigated, MLS, MLT, C/S, VP/T, C/T, DC/C, DC/T, T/S, and CT/T, did not show significant differences. Finally, the experimental group significantly improved in accuracy, $F { = } 1 6 . 3 8 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 0 9$ .

Guided by the quantitative results, close text analysis was performed, which involved careful iterative reading and comparing of all of the essays for a few rounds. The analysis revealed that the significantly better performance of the experimental group in terms of accuracy and complexity can be translated into enhanced comprehensibility and clarity of their writing. To exemplify, two post-intervention essays from the experimental group are demonstrated below. Overall, the ‘after’ versions in both examples below clearly demonstrate far fewer errors. In the first, the post-intervention draft was considerably improved in terms of accuracy such as in expressions, conjunction, connector, and tense (e.g., ‘World’ becomes ‘The world’; ‘spent’ becomes ‘spend’; and ‘Furthermore, to find solutions’ becomes ‘In addition, we can also find solutions’), which improves comprehensibility, although both lexical complexity and syntactic structure remained similar, aligned with the quantitative results. Improvement in accuracy, as Plakans et  al. (2019) suggested, is often critical to elevating overall language proficiency. Additionally, the essay is better segmented, resulting in more T-units with each conveying one clear idea at a time; for example, clause 5 was long and ungrammatical in the ‘before’ version, but was divided into two sentences in the ‘after’ version, each containing one clear idea and becoming grammatical. Below, errors are underlined, and the arrows designate the changes in ideas circumscribed by T-units.

Similar to Lin, in the second example, Huang also made improvement in accuracy shown in her improved use of both expressions (e.g., ‘will be easier for me to’; ‘some … while others …’) and usages (e.g., ‘find it uncomfortable to’ and ‘confirm with’). This example demonstrates alignment with the quantitative result in terms of improved accuracy and syntactic complexity (specifically in terms of mean length of clause). The text reflects enhanced accuracy and chunking, resulting in more T-units and clearer ideas. For example, the two shorter clauses ‘When I take the classes, I prefer the way of face to face interaction’ (T-unit 1, ‘before’ version) was revised as one longer clause, which was more concise in meaning, ‘In the class, I prefer face-to-face interaction between teachers and students’ (T-unit 1, ‘after’ version). Another example is T-unit 4, the ‘before’ version. The long but erroneous sentence packs in too much information which can be made clearer if rendered in more T-units, seen in T-units 5 and 6 in the ‘after’ version. This helped the student to express clearly the challenge of concentrating in class if she cannot meet the professor face-to-face: ‘When using online courses, I cannot see the professor’s face, so I may not be able to focus on the classroom, which is a waste of time and is not conducive to learning.’

In the ‘before’ version, the message was awkwardly constructed as: ‘I cannot see the professor’s facial expression so clear that I probably can’t concentrate.’ Huang was also more adept at using relative clauses to supplement information, which contributed to greater conciseness and complexity. For example, ‘I can confirm with the professor immediately, which is different from online courses’ (T-unit 4, ‘after’ version) and ‘… so I may not be able to focus on the classroom, which is a waste of time and not conducive to learning’ (T-unit 6, ‘after’ version), as opposed to the more opaque and shorter clause ‘I can confirm them right away’ (T-unit 3, ‘before’ version).

In addition to improved accuracy and syntactic complexity, Huang also did very well on using idiomatic expressions such as ‘is conducive to’ (T-unit 6) and ‘as to’ (T-unit 9) to combine sentences, most often identified in advanced learners’ writing. Particularly, her improvement in style made her writing sound more formal and compact. This includes the use of, for example, nominalization (e.g., ‘reduce the possibility of me misunderstanding …’, ‘a waste of time’) and relative clauses (e.g., ‘which is different from …’). She also cut down on empty words (e.g., the use of ‘There are’).

a Positive perception percentages were obtained by adding up positive responses (scale 6–10) to positive statements and negative responses (scale 1–5) to negative statements.

Finally, based on the perception questionnaire post-intervention, the experimental group students’ attitudes toward using GT to learn were largely positive. Of the three dimensions, writing anxiety was perceived the most positively, with close to $7 5 \%$ positive responses. Next, $7 3 . 1 \%$ of the responses held that writing with GT was motivating. Finally, close to $7 0 \%$ considered using GT in writing not difficult. Table 6 presents the results.

# 5.  Discussion

The training in recursive editing made possible by rounds of inversed translation using GT allowed the experimental group students to perform significantly better on error correction, as supported both by

Tsai (2019) and Lee (2020). The experimental group also demonstrated significantly better performance in both accuracy and complexity, lending support particularly to the sparse evidence of the capacity of GT to promote complexity, found in Fredholm (2015) and Cancino and Panes (2021). However, the training did not enable the same group to perform significantly better in such an open-ended task as essay writing, which differs from O’Neill’s (2019) finding. This might be attributed to the type and challenge level of the writing task. In O’Neill’s study, the task elicited more personal experience than argumentation than did that in the current study. The task in the current study was an open writing task which was argumentative in nature. In addition, scaffolding was provided in the form of prompts in O’Neill’s as steps to guide writing. The level of challenge may thus explain the differences in writing score performance. Additionally, the need to tackle all aspects of writing, including conceiving and organizing ideas, choosing the right words, and simultaneously self-correcting may be so taxing that they failed to outperform the control group. Conversely, the error correction test was more well-defined, where GT’s capacity seemed to be optimized. However, a number of studies (Cumming et  al., 2006; Gebril & Plakans, 2013; Plakans, et  al., 2019) have found that the linguistic profile, that is, accuracy, fluency and complexity, of a piece of writing can positively predict the writing score, although significant difference was not found between the groups in the posttest writing scores.

Further examining the linguistic profiles of the essays in terms of fluency, complexity, and accuracy revealed a mixed picture, and the results are inconsistent with those of past studies, probably due to different research aims and designs. Aligned with the significantly better performance in the error correction task, the experimental group also showed significantly better accuracy in the post-intervention essays, resonating with Niño (2008), Cancino and Panes (2021) and Giannetti (2016), although Giannetti indicated that the seventh graders investigated also improved in increased length, inconsistent with the current study. Giannetti (2016), however, did not specify whether the writing tasks were timed, which can have an impact. Also, the assigned tasks differed considerably in challenge level. Giannetti (2016) asked the students to write 30-word narratives or a short email, while in the current study, the students wrote an academic essay of approximately 150 words. Similarly, Stapleton and Leung Ka Kin (2019) also revealed that GT outperformed humans in producing better writing in grammar but not in vocabulary and comprehensibility. In the current study, however, the significant improvement in accuracy was often accompanied by improved comprehensibility. The research designs were very different though.

Stapleton and Leung Ka Kin (2019) had teachers assess human- and machine-generated writing, while the current study implemented instruction on using GT in language learning.

However, Fredholm (2015) reported that the targeted high school students improved in terms of the complexity and fluency of their writing but not the accuracy. The study only had the student’s access online translation without intervention. This condition, therefore, resembles the condition of the control group in the current study. Without the cognitive demand devoted to recursive editing facilitated by GT, the students in Fredholm’s (2015) study and those in the control group in the current study seemed to write more. The control group in the current study showed significantly better fluency in the number of sentences, clauses, and T-units, but not in total words.

In terms of syntactic complexity, the experimental group wrote fewer but longer sentences, clauses, and T-units post-intervention, a sign of greater complexity. The significantly longer mean length of clause confirmed this. This aligns with Cancino and Panes (2021), who also found correlation between GT with and without training and both complexity or accuracy in writing. However, the lack of significant difference between the GT with and without training groups in Cancino and Panes (2021) might be attributed to the brief instruction, lasting only $9 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . Given more training, the experimental group in the current study did perform significantly better in accuracy and complexity compared to the control group which did not receive any training. This finding contradicts Lee (2020), who indicated that MT helped the students to improve their grammatical accuracy but not their syntactic complexity, possibly also due to a lack of training.

Overall, to better pinpoint students’ writing performance, the study sought two different but mutually reinforcing approaches to writing evaluation: (1) human rating which is more holistic, and (2) linguistic analysis which evaluates by the unit of a sentence and by examining one linguistic aspect at a time, which may tease out the distinct advantages recursive editing with GT exhibited. The majority of the past research (e.g., Cancino & Panes, 2021; Fredholm, 2015; Giannetti, 2016; Tsai, 2019), however, has mostly evaluated writing performance by only the number of errors and/or the linguistic profile, but not the discursive aspects of content and organization, which we undertook. The current study offers evidence of the capacity of GT to facilitate accuracy and complexity but not so much fluency. Yoon and Polio (2017) found that without intervention, accuracy in writing failed to develop. However, with the aid of GT to recursively edit, accuracy was found to have significantly improved in the experimental group, who also outperformed the control group in our study. Our results also resonated with Robinson’s

Cognition Hypothesis (2001), which stated that increasing the cognitive demands of tasks, such as writing, pushes learners to greater accuracy and complexity of L2 production.

The lack of development in fluency may be explained by the Trade-off Hypothesis (Skehan, 2009), which states that the goals of attaining fluency, accuracy, and complexity often compete for a learner’s cognitive energy in language tasks. Given the requirement to work with GT recursively, the experimental group students may have prioritized editing to the extent of reaching significantly better accuracy in writing and attaining precision in error correction tests. This seems to further lead the students to produce more complex clauses but no longer texts, which might explain the lack of significant improvement in fluency post-intervention.

Finally, the training of recursive editing by way of rounds of inversed translation presented more opportunities for the experimental group students to participate in critical analysis, hypothesis posing, and testing. These may drive the students to monitor and reflect on cross-linguistic differences (Niño, 2020), and therefore, may have raised their metalinguistic awareness, as revealed in their better performance in terms of accuracy and error correction. This is also aligned with their positive attitude toward how GT alleviated task difficulty. The instruction and exercises of recursive editing, however, were often inevitably sentence-bound, which might explain why transfer to such an open-ended task as essay writing was not pronounced. Lee (2020) also concurred that GT was weak at discourse level, and investigation of how GT may facilitate transfer at discursive level is warranted.

# 6.  Limitations, pedagogical implications, and conclusion

The study provides empirical evidence of using GT as a language learning tool for enhanced performance in error correction, accuracy, and complexity in writing. The study is, however, limited in the sample size and duration of investigation. While after the semester-long training, the students’ writing increased in complexity to some extent, the evidence is not as strong as that in accuracy and error correction. Given longer training and practice, GT’s potential for aiding complexity in writing may be better consolidated. It should also be acknowledged that writing takes much longer time to develop (Yoon & Polio, 2017), which this short-term study may not fully capture. In addition, dictionaries were also allowed for both groups, and the effect of using a dictionary was not controlled for in the current study. Future studies may consider this variable and its effect in addition to or in contrast to GT. Similarly, as also explicated in Methods, the decision against a strictly controlled condition where the control group is denied access to GT is driven by concerns related to authenticity in language learning given that GT is omnipresent these days. Given this, the results should be interpreted with caution. Pedagogically, training in recursive editing presents opportunities for students to reflect on cross-linguistic differences through debates, critical analysis, and hypothesis testing, mentioned by the experimental group students in their reflection notes. Niño (2020) stated that MT-assisted language learning can facilitate monitoring and enhance metalinguistic reflection, which is key to raising metalinguistic awareness. Our study offers expanded but tentative findings regarding the potential of recursive editing through GT in assisting both the local and the discursive aspects of writing, the latter of which was rarely explored before. It is recommended that future research extend instruction beyond a semester, allow an untimed writing condition, explore different writing tasks and genres, and investigate students’ cognitive processes while engaged in recursive editing to better understand the potential of recursive editing with GT.

# Notes

1. One participant in the experimental group and two participants in the control group did not take the error correction posttest, and two participants from both groups did not submit post-intervention essays. The reasons include absence from class, dropping out of the course halfway, and plagiarism.   
2. The experiment has obtained approval from the Research Ethics Committee at the National Taiwan Normal University (case number: 201905HS091).

# Sample questions in the pretest and posttest

1. Multiple choice questions:

Q3. 只要我們認真做任何事 就一定會成功。

1. As long as we do anything seriously, we will success. 2. We work seriously, and we must succeed. 3. We only do anything seriously, we must success. 4. As long as we work hard, we will succeed. (Here, the correct answer is (4). (1) and (3) are incorrect because following a modal verb, a verb is expected. In (2), using ‘must succeed’ is inappropriate in tone but is a frequent mistake made by the students, mostly likely due to interference from their native language.) 2. Identify and revise inappropriate expressions or erroneous sentences: Q7. How do we become a genuine person without interactions with people? 我 們如何在不與人互動的情況下成為真正的人？ (Here, ‘真正的’ [‘genuine’ in the target language] in the L1 should be corrected. If the students flip the English-Chinese pair once, GT changes ‘genuine’ in the original version to ‘real’ as in ‘How do we become real people without engaging with people?’ Flipping the translation may help the students to notice the shift from ‘genuine’ to ‘real’ to be problematic and make correction.)

3. Identify all the problematic wording or expressions in the English sentences and revise accordingly:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Q11</td><td>Underline problematic expressions</td><td> Revise</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Our education system treat us like. the process of standardization, and the production line is an example of standardization, teachers might ignore the students&#x27; differences in this education system. [Note. The sentence suffers from 4 to 5 mechanical issues. Use GT to help you revise it into correct English</td><td>Our (capitalization), treats (SV agreement), production (spelling),. and teachers (conjunction) [ok if start a new sentence here], educational (or &#x27;education&#x27; as. stated here)</td></tr></table></body></html>

The students were required to first underline problematic words or expressions and make corrections. The number of issues that need to be identified shows a range of 4–5 because ‘education’ and ‘educational’ in the last line are both considered acceptable.
