Despite the wealth of productive ESP/EAP research on promotional genres over the past decade, such research has yet to spotlight Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statements (DEISs) for academic job application purposes in U.S. higher education. To address this gap, this study systematically analyzes the rhetorical features of 80 DEISs and explores the perceptions of faculty administrators, ESP/EAP writing teachers, and novice writers regarding the genre analysis findings.

A step-driven rhetorical move analysis targeting the frequency and distribution of rhetorical moves/steps, as well as patterns in inter- and intra-move sequences within the DEISs, was implemented. The analysis unveiled five reoccurring moves, each consisting of multiple steps, with varying frequencies across different texts. It also identified a mixture of circular, linear, and somewhat disorganized patterns in inter-move sequences.

Furthermore, through subsequent semi-structured interviews with three faculty members and one L2 student writer, the study revealed a consensus among the interviewees regarding the practical value of the genre analytic findings, particularly for ESP/EAP writing instruction and professional assessment. Meanwhile, it highlighted the interviewees’ mixed reactions concerning specific rhetorical features of the DEISs and their collective doubts surrounding the writing and use of DEISs.

# 1. Introduction

The past decade has witnessed ongoing debates regarding the use, necessity, and value of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statements (DEISs)1 as “gatekeeping” tools to solicit U.S. higher academic job applications (e.g., Bombaci & Pejchar, 2022; Carroll et al., 2022; Powell, 2023). Amidst such controversies,2 DEISs are increasingly mandated as part of faculty job application materials to ensure, enhance, and advance equitable and inclusive practices in terms of recruiting and retaining talented academics from diverse, and often, underrepresented backgrounds and marginalized communities (Paul and Maranto, 2021) in both STEM and non-STEM disciplines (Bombaci & Pejchar, 2022). In such statements, applicants elucidate their experiences, expertise, and contributions related to DEI. From this perspective, DEISs function as a promotional genre (Bhatia, 1993), through which writers convince their target audience with a “favorable, positive, and relevant description” of their abilities in exchange for future benefits (p. 119). Unpacking the writing practices of DEISs is thus crucial to support the professional growth of academics seeking employment in U.S. higher education.

However, no English for Specific Purposes (ESP) genre research has explored DEISs despite the wealth of productive research on promotional genres (e.g., Connor & Mauranen, 1999; Ding, 2007; Halleck & Connor, 2006; Wang, 2023). Researchers and practitioners from non-ESP fields (e.g., STEM education and higher education administration) have disseminated guidelines on the general rhetorical components in DEISs through university websites, policy memos, practitioner journals, or newspapers (e.g., Inside Higher Ed or The Chronicle of Higher Education) (e.g., Beck, 2018; Reyes, 2018; Sylvester et al., 2019; see also Center for Teaching & Learning at The University of Texas at Austin; The Derek Bok Center for Teaching & Learning at Harvard University). However, they are primarily based on practitioner experience rather than empirical research or are derived from analyzing a limited number of sample texts. More critically, they do not reveal the authentic writing practices inherent to the DEIS genre, nor do they specify how different rhetorical components may be prioritized or sequenced within DEISs. Insofar as DEISs remain a high-stakes, formidable genre for academic writers, as well as their writing teachers, it is imperative to systematically unveil what writers actually do to structure this genre.

The current study addresses the above gaps by investigating the rhetorical features of 80 DEISs. It contributes to the burgeoning body of ESP promotional genre research by (1) presenting a comprehensive rhetorical move framework of DEISs and (2) exploring how the framework represents the DEIS genre and informs its practice, as perceived by writers, teachers, and evaluators.

# 2. Literature review

This study is situated within three pivotal strands of practice- and empirical-based research: (1) the evolution and current status of DEISs, (2) the general rhetorical components of DEISs, and (3) the examination of academic promotional genres from an ESP/EAP perspective.

# 2.1. DEISs: A brief overview of historical context and present dynamics

Contrary to more established academic promotional genres, such as statements of purpose/personal statements (e.g., Ding, 2007) or teaching philosophy statements (e.g., Wang, 2023), DEISs are relatively nascent. Ball’s (2013) opinion piece in Inside Higher Ed marked one of the earliest acknowledgments of DEISs, which the researcher frames as akin to a “statement of faith” amidst additional materials in academic job applications (para. 25). Even though Ball (2013) admitted that she had never written a DEIS, she noted their prevalence in “urban, open-admissions colleges, historically black, or tribal colleges as well as rural colleges that are trying to increase their diversity profiles through student recruitment” (para. 27).

The significance of DEISs surged in 2014 (Kelsky, 2014), paralleling the University of California’s top-down, multi-campus initiative that enforced DEISs as part of all faculty hiring procedures and practices to “recruit more Black and Latino professionals” (Powell, 2023; para. 20; see also Brown, 2019). This shift, as Ficht & Levashina (2023) interpreted, aligned with a broader societal movement towards diversity and equity, underscored by worldwide activist movements like Black Lives Matter, suggesting DEISs as a manifestation of higher education’s commitment to and “adaptation of DEI policies” (p. 215). However, DEISs have not been without controversy, and the debates targeting and surrounding DEISs have mushroomed. The DEI legislation tracker (2024), an open-accessed dashboard by the Chronicle of Higher Education, periodically tracks and updates how legislation prohibits higher education institutions from conducting diversity training, mandating DEISs in hiring and promotion, or considering race, sex, ethnicity, or national origin in admissions or employment. As of early February 2024, 65 bills in 25 states and the U.S. Congress have been introduced since 2023.18 bills explicitly focused on the ban of DEISs, and 8 bills have been signed into law. Critiques often highlighted the range of legal, ideological, and validity issues of DEISs (Ficht & Levashina, 2023), suggesting that these statements could lead to biased hiring practices and force applicants to disclose different aspects of their identities that make them subject to discrimination (Kang et al., 2016).

Despite these debates, the strategic use of DEISs (Carnes et al., 2020) garners considerable support given its multiple benefits from diverse perspectives.3 By curating and analyzing personal narratives from tenure-track faculty of color in the U.S., Matthew (2016) advocated for concepts related to DEI, such as diversity and inclusion, as vehicles for promoting a more tolerant and equitable professorate on both individual and institutional levels, echoing Canning & Reddick’s (2019) view that DEISs represent “a way to strengthen the academy’s mission to serve all its constituencies with integrity and fairness” (para. 2). Similarly, Bombaci & Pejchar (2022) identified widespread support for DEISs in their nationwide survey study involving

200 DEI experts from U.S. higher education institutions, underscoring their integral roles in faculty teaching, mentoring, service, and research, as well as their power in compelling institutions to improve labor issues and reward relevant efforts accordingly. Carroll et al. (2022) found that writing DEISs can positively affect academic writers’ motivation for recognizing and reflecting on DEI-related issues. The advantages of engaging with, writing, and discussing DEISs and their related concepts highlight the need to investigate what academic writers do to compose this genre, one that is crucial for supporting their career success and fostering a deeper understanding of DEI in terms of one’s professional advancement and broader institutional change.

# 2.2. General rhetorical components of DEISs

Considering that the demand for DEISs in U.S. higher education institutions is “common and likely to increase” (Paul & Maranto, 2021, p. 10), along with the advantages offered by writing and implementing DEISs, an increasing body of nonESP research and practice-oriented literature has dedicated itself to revealing the common rhetorical components in DEISs. This body of work is primarily pursued by university administrators, teacher educators, or instructional specialists based on (1) their professional experiences and anecdotal observations (Beck, 2018; Reyes, 2018), (2) university teaching/ learning center published materials (Center for Teaching & Learning at The University of Texas at Austin; The Derek Bok Center for Teaching & Learning at Harvard University),4 and (3) analysis of sample DEISs $\mathrm { \Delta } \cdot \mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } = 3 9$ ) written by assistant professor applicants (Sylvester et al., 2019). These findings are presented as practitioner reports, workshop materials, writing guidelines, or opinion articles, and are synthesized in Table 1.

Table 1 Common rhetorical components of DEISs.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Beck (2018)</td><td>Center for Teaching &amp; Learning at The University of Texas at Austin</td><td>Reyes (2018)</td><td>Sylvester et al.

As Table 1 shows, composing DEISs involves a conventional focus on four central components: (1) writers’ broad understanding of DEI-related principles, values, goals, and concepts as well as a commitment to DEI, (2) their personal experience in terms of engagement with or interest in DEI, (3) their DEI-related competence, spanning teaching, mentoring, research, and service, and (4) their future plans for contributing to DEI. However, some tensions exist. According to Sylvester et al. (2019), many DEIS writers tend to describe how they personally become passionate about DEI with subsequent reflections on their personal growth. This aligns with Reyes (2018), who suggested that DEIS writers can interpret how their personal lives have been “shaped by the various academic and social positions you [they] occupy” (para. 14), weaving details such as being a first-generation college student into their commitment to DEI work. Beck (2018) recommended careful framing of one’s personal history or identity, noting that “Some degree of transparency may help readers contextualize the experiences and approaches you detail in your statement” (para. 18). Conversely, the guidelines from the Center for Teaching & Learning at The University of Texas at Austin and The Derek Bok Center for Teaching & Learning at Harvard University either explicitly advised against incorporating personal details into DEISs or advocated for doing so based on a strategic rationale. Despite the usefulness of the above findings, much of this body of scholarship is grounded in practitioner insights and anecdotal evidence. To date, there appears to be a lack of empirical research unraveling DEISs through the lens of ESP genre analysis. This gap is significant, considering the robust discourse advocating for DEISs due to their benefits and the general lack of attention to academic promotional genres in ESP genre research. Therefore, this study seeks to demystify the actual writing practices inherent in the DEIS genre and identify how these practices are perceived and validated by diverse members within academic discourse communities.

# 2.3. ESP genre research on academic promotional genres

The concept of promotional genre originates from Bhatia’s (1993) scholarship on professional written genres. In academic settings, such genres include (1) those seeking professional development opportunities, such as statements of purpose/ personal statements (e.g., Ding, 2007; Samraj & Monk, 2008) and teaching philosophy statements (e.g., Wang, 2023), and (2) those aiming to disseminate knowledge, such as conference abstracts (e.g., Yoon & Casal, 2020) and research grant proposals (e.g., Connor, 2000). Such research has primarily adopted a Swalesian rhetorical move analytic approach to uncover the target genres’ textual features, complemented by interviews with practitioners to gauge their perceptions (e.g., Chiu, 2015; Kessler, 2020; Wang, 2023).

Academic promotional genres are strategically structured to emphasize different aspects of the writer’s competence, as manifested in the frequency and sequence of relevant rhetorical features. In demystifying variation in rhetorical features of statements of purpose and personal statements as two separate text types in 50 Fulbright grant applications, Kessler (2020) found that all the applicants employed a comparable move (making competence claims) across the two text types. This focus on presenting a competent professional identity finds a parallel in Wang’s (2023) genre analysis of teaching philosophy statements written by 100 U.S. university faculty applying for and eventually winning prestigious teaching awards. Specifically, Wang (2023) discovered that many applicants favored the step, Describing teacher actions ${ \bf \langle n = 9 9 \cdot }$ ) (instead of Describing learner actions, $\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = ~ 6 4$ ), with a subsequent step, Justifying teacher reasoning underlying said actions, to characterize a competent and thoughtful teacher identity. Some others also deployed the move Demonstrating teacher competence outside the classroom, focusing on their research (e.g., pedagogical scholarships) or service work (e.g., faculty mentoring) to showcase a fuller range of teacher competencies. Concomitantly, the applicants also arranged the moves into a cyclical sequence by revolving around key rhetorical components such as “who I am and what I believe,” “how I teach,” and “why I teach in particular ways.”

What makes academic promotional genres intriguing is the discrepancies in how institutions, gatekeepers, researchers, and writers interpret insights from pure textual analysis and, by extension, the role and function of promotional genres. In terms of the disconnection between writer practices and reader preferences, Kessler (2020) found that although the Fulbright grant applicants used overlapping rhetorical strategies in their personal statements and statements of purpose, the grant reviewers negatively interpreted such repetition. In terms of the disconnection between writer practices and research findings, Connor (2000) interviewed grant writers based on findings of Connor & Mauranen’s (1999) genre study on the writing of successful grant proposals to the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. While the grant writers in Connor (2000) largely agreed with the findings from Connor & Mauranen (1999), they questioned how particular moves (e.g., competence claims) could have been divided into more concrete strategies. These disconnections are also captured in Chiu (2015) and Chiu (2016). Specifically, Chiu (2015) examined how admissions committee members from U.S. and U.K. institutions evaluated personal statements in graduate school applications. The U.S. faculty assigned more weight to personal statements as compared to other application materials while the U.K. faculty valued the applicants’ research proposals more. In a follow-up study, Chiu (2016) interviewed the writers of the personal statements from Chiu (2015). While both U.K. and U.S. writers employed comparable rhetorical strategies (e.g., Education/academic achievements and experiences), the U.S. writers intentionally incorporated features of research proposals into their statements to enhance their researcher identity.

The above alignments and misalignments between what writers do and how they are perceived by those who use or evaluate promotional genres have important implications for understanding the DEIS genre. They illustrate the occluded or semi-occluded nature of promotional genres (Swales, 1996), and, in the case of the DEIS genre, although relevant samples are accessible nowadays online, how they are perceived and utilized in decision-making processes remains opaque. More importantly, as Section 2.2 shows, this genre is often convoluted by its emerging genre status, controversial conceptualizations, varied rhetorical conventions, and shifting guidelines and audience expectations. Consequently, the “fuzziness” of DEISs yields significant challenges to both seasoned and novice writers. Furthermore, international academics or second language (L2) writers may find this genre particularly difficult not just because of the DEIS genre’s evolving conventions and norms but also because of their unfamiliarity with “American individualism,” the concept that an individual scholar or faculty member can claim to be able to contribute substantially to their institution in terms of diversity, equity, and inclusion (Koutseridi, 2021, para. 6). Additionally, context-related factors shape and complicate how promotional genres “take the shapes that they do” and eventually inform “how we might assist students in mastering these discourses” (Swales, 2019, p. 81). The current study thus contributes to the literature above by bridging the gaps among theoretical advocacy for the use of DEISs, the authentic writing practices that structure DEISs, and the dynamic understanding of the genre.

# 3. The current study

The current study aims to systematically identify the rhetorical features of DEISs and subsequently explore how these features are interpreted by those who write, teach, and/or evaluate the DEIS genre. It is guided by three research questions (RQs).5

RQ1. How are DEISs rhetorically structured, and how frequently do their rhetorical features appear?   
RQ2. If any, what are the patterns in the way the moves and steps are sequenced?   
RQ3. How are the findings from RQs 1 and 2 perceived by writers, writing teachers, and gatekeepers in terms of both   
representing the genre and informing its practice?

# 4. Methodology

The current section details the methodological procedures, with a step-by-step breakdown of the study’s implementation process in Appendix A.

4.1. The DEISs corpus

A corpus of 80 DEISs was compiled. It comprised two main sources.

1. Texts from recruited participants: Recent graduates seeking employment in U.S. higher education were recruited to share the generic version of their DEISs.   
2. Texts from publicly accessible sources: DEISs were collected from U.S. university websites of teaching/learning centers and graduate student/faculty professional development institutes, as well as those from academics’ professional websites (e.g., published online portfolios).

Combining texts from recruited writers and published sources has been an established practice for analyzing promotional genres (e.g., Samraj & Monk, 2008). However, instead of gathering samples from commercial websites (e.g., Ding, 2007), I chose university websites because texts from such sources are often contextualized by guidelines or annotations made by instructional specialists or teacher educators, which could yield helpful insights into the subsequent rhetorical analysis. Additionally, sample texts from university or academic professionals’ websites are published to support the professional development of academics or exhibit real writing practices, as is also the case for those collected from recruited participants. Therefore, the aforementioned data sources are valid because of their practical and authentic values.

Furthermore, the DEISs must have concurrently met the two criteria below to be eligible for analysis.

1. Be “generic”: The DEISs must be “universal,” sharing similar prompts and promotional goals (e.g., seeking employment in U.S. higher education instead of graduate school applications). This was not a challenge because the majority of those published on websites tended to be general and those shared by participants were requested to be untailored. 2. Be “complete”: The DEISs must be “complete.” Published sample texts covered with “blocks” or with a significant amount of information being removed were excluded from data collection, as exemplified in Figure 1, a screenshot of an annotated DEIS published on the official website of the Communication Lab of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Following Wang (2023), all sample texts were saved into Microsoft Excel sheets and were cleaned for formatting errors, typos, and special character issues caused during the data collection or conversion process. Information relevant to the authors’ identities was anonymized. As Table 2 shows, the 80 cleaned DEISs total 61,335 words, encompassing both STEM $( \mathtt { n } = 5 5$ ) and non-STEM $\mathtt { \Delta } \mathtt { n } = 2 5$ ) disciplinary fields, including but not limited to physics, computer engineering, mathematics, education, composition, applied linguistics and TESOL, and sociology.

# 4.2. Rhetorical move-step analysis

To address RQ1, I manually annotated the 80 DEIs, synthesizing insights from methodological standards and analytical practices from previous literature.

I followed Swales’ (2004) operationalization of moves as “discoursal or rhetorical units performing coherent communicative functions in texts” (pp. 228–229) and steps as subdivisions of moves, which function as more fine-grained functional units that realize their corresponding moves (Swales, 1990, 2004). Drawing from Moreno & Swales (2018), the analysis targeted steps as basic units and subsequently went up to the move level. Because no existing rhetorical move framework of DEISs exists, a fully top-down, move-driven approach was not appropriate. Alternatively, as demonstrated by Yoon and Casal (2020) and Wang (2023), a step-driven approach allowed for more comprehensive and meticulous identifications of the target genre’s communicative functions, which is particularly suitable for examining promotional genres.

Synthesizing insights from previous research (Cotos, 2018; Kim et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2021; Wang, 2023), a three-phase annotation approach was implemented. An external expert with extensive ESP genre research and professional experience was periodically consulted. The purpose of the consultations was tri-fold: (a) determining whether a step should be tagged as mono-functional or multi-functional (see (1) below); (b) deciding categories of different steps based on the content of different DEISs (e.g., whether “leading a research lab of undergraduate and graduate research assistants” should be interpreted as “mentoring/advising” or “service”); and (c) assessing the accessibility of the presentation of the framework, i.e., the extent to which the final framework, including the naming of different rhetorical moves/steps and its corresponding explanations (see Appendix B), can be easily understood by other genre researchers, academic writing teachers, and student writers. A senior doctoral student in Applied Linguistics with relevant research and teaching experience was recruited by me to serve as an additional coder in reliability testing.

The first phase involved a close, iterative manual annotation of 40 texts randomly retrieved from the DEISs corpus. In accordance with Lu et al. (2021), move-step tags (e.g., [M1_S1]) were placed at sentential boundaries. As a step is a rhetorical construct rather than a linguistic construct, this resulted in sentences either performing dual rhetorical functions as a whole, as characterized in (1), or performing dual functions within different parts of the sentences, as illustrated in (2). While Moreno and Swales (2018) assigned single move-step tags to steps according to “their most prominent communicative functions” (p. 54), I retained the dual-function tags to more productively capture the multifunctional discourse of promotional genres, an annotation practice also implemented by other scholars (Lu et al., 2021). My piloting annotation resulted in an initial framework, which was subsequently modified based on discussion with the external expert.

(1) I have employed a student-centered approach to advancing diversity as I work with my advisees in my lab and all students in my classes. [M3_S4A: Describing mentoring or advising experiences] [M3_S4B: Describing teaching experiences]   
(2) Advancing diversity requires all of these components for minority students, and I have taken an active role in building retention and outreach programs targeting students from underrepresented groups. [M1_S1: Expressing overall beliefs, feelings, attitudes, or aims] (which points to the “Advancing . minority students” clause) [M3_S4D: Describing service, outreach, or volunteer experiences] (which points to the “and I have . groups” clause)

The second phase targeted continuous coding, reliability testing, and refinement of the framework. The doctoral student (additional coder) first participated in a training session. The coder and I then used the framework to collaboratively annotate five DEISs and resolved discrepancies through extensive discussions. The coder was then given two weeks to independently annotate the 40 DEISs previously annotated by me in phase one. In the end, percentage agreement, a suitable measure for inter-rater reliability for rhetorical move analysis (Rau & Shih, 2021), yielded results of high reliability: $9 4 \%$ for moves and $9 0 \%$ for steps. Another round of consultation with the external expert was also conducted, and the consultation primarily targeted fine-tuning various categories of steps. For example, a discussion was held concerning whether M1_S3: Critiquing and reflecting on relevant issues should be treated as an independent step or as part of M1_S1: Expressing overall beliefs, understandings, attitudes, or aims, and discrepancies were resolved through collaboratively examining all ambiguous cases. Eventually, it was decided that M1_S3 should be distinguished from M1_S1 because it conveys a particular critical stance (See (6) below), which is not fully captured in M1_S1 (See (3.1) below). The second phase eventually led to a newly modified framework.

For the third phase, I independently annotated the remaining 40 texts with ongoing modifications to the framework. The external expert was consulted for interpreting ambiguous cases and the clarity and accessibility of the framework, eventually leading to the finalized one as presented in Table 3. An elaborated version of the framework with detailed explanations of each step is presented in Appendix B.

Calculation of the frequency of the move-step tags was achieved through Python and manual verifications. In determining the status of the commonality of the moves and steps, I used “very common,” “common,” and “less common” to refer to steps shared by $7 0 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ of the texts, $4 0 \% - 6 9 \%$ , and below $4 0 \%$ , respectively. I used such neutral language to mitigate the potential risk of implying particular features as more “valuable” than others, an impression that would have been potentially invoked by labels such as “conventional” (e.g., Kanoksilapatham, 2005), as it is entirely possible to navigate the writing of a genre without any obligatory or conventional features (Tardy, 2016).

# 4.3. Identification of patterns in move-step sequence

As no empirical study exists in terms of the sequence of rhetorical components of DEISs from a promotional genre perspective, I explored patterns in both inter-move (i.e., how one move transitions to another) and intra-move (i.e., how steps were organized within a given move) sequences in the 80 DEISs in order to comprehensively unveil the progression and shift of rhetorical features within the DEIS genre. A series of Python scripts on the order of the move-step tags in the 80 DEISs were implemented, and the results were manually verified. Table 4 presents the top 2 most frequent types of inter-move sequences, and Table 5 presents the top 2 most frequent opening and concluding moves.

# 4.4. Semi-structured interviews $\mathcal { E }$ analysis

Four U.S.-based academics participated in the interviews: Dr. Chen, Dr. Gallagher, Aaron, and Molly (all pseudonyms). Table 6 outlines their credentials, backgrounds, and experiences in relation to the DEIS genre. Aaron, an international Chinese graduate student who recently completed his doctoral degree in Theoretical Physics at a U.S. university and is now working at another U.S. university, wrote one of the DEISs in my corpus. Molly, who also comes from China, is a third-year Ph.D. student in Advertising and recently wrote her DEIS after attending an academic writing workshop on DEIS hosted by her university’s teaching/learning center. Although Molly’s DEIS was not included in the corpus, her identity as a novice writer enabled her to contribute interesting interpretation of the DEIS genre based on her learning-to-write experience.

Following Wang (2023), each interviewee participated in an orientation Zoom meeting, followed by individual Zoom interview meetings ( $\sim 3 5$ min per meeting). The interviews targeted the participants’ perceptions of the framework and related findings based on their experience writing, reading, and conceptualizing the genre. Using Zoom’s share screen function, the participants and I had access to the framework, findings of patterns in the move-step sequences (like Tables 4 and 5), and sample text extracts. Sample interview questions are included in Appendix C.

All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and I coded the transcribed data inductively and deductively in an iterative manner. The inductive coding targeted identifying and organizing themes and connections among themes emerging from the data while the deductive coding focused on linking and interpreting the themes and connections to those appearing from previous research on DEISs and academic promotional genres, such as those reviewed in Section 2.

# 5. Findings

# 5.1. RQ1: rhetorical structure of the DEIS genre

My rhetorical analysis reveals that DEISs may be structured by five moves, each containing multiple steps (Table 3). This section addresses RQ 1 by reporting the genre analytic findings.

VC $=$ Very Common. ${ \mathsf C } =$ Common. $\mathrm { L C = }$ Less Common.

# 5.1.1. Move 1: Construct a DEI profile

As a very common move, Move 1 is executed through three steps, as exemplified below.

# M1_S1: Expressing overall beliefs, understandings, attitudes, or aims

(3.1) By providing an equal-opportunity environment that fosters respect and communication across gender, racial or other cultural communities, a university will enhance the student experience as well as enable collaborative and innovative research.   
(3.2) Working to understand the ways oppression and difference interact and reinforce each other is central to my approach to the classroom and research alike, and I am committed to teaching and researching in ways that actively seek to counteract and resist oppression of all kinds.

# M1_S2A: Revealing and discussing personal background or history

(4) .I was disowned for a period of time identifying as a gay man, scorned for not identifying as a Christian, mocked for appreciating “liberal” or “progressive” views .

M1_S2B: Revealing and discussing academic/professional background or history

(5) While an undergraduate at X University, I became involved in a number of programs for minority students, and these have had a profound influence on me.

# M1_S3: Critiquing and reflecting on issues in the field

(6) Gender equality is advancing in our science departments, but has yet to approach parity . Ethnic diversity is not close to where it should be, and needs to be, in medicine or science .

As the sole very common step in Move 1, M1_S1 enables DEIS writers to convey their beliefs and attitudes about DEI, including its institutional values in (3.1) (fosters respect and communication, enhance the student experience . enable collaborative and innovative research), its related concepts in (3.2) (. ways oppression and difference interact and reinforce each other, and their aims in (3.2) (. seek to counteract and resist oppression of all kinds), underscoring why DEI matters institutionally in (3.1) (. a university will .) or personally in (3.2) (. central to my approach .).

Next, M1_S2A and M1_S2B complement each other by unveiling different aspects of writers’ background in the context of DEI, as demonstrated in (4),6 encompassing sexual orientation (gay man), religion (not identifying as a Christian), and political perspectives (“liberal” or “progressive” views), and in (5), focusing on prior academic or professional histories (a number of programs for minority students) in terms of the writers’ interest in DEI (profound influence on me). Collectively, these two steps reveal who the writers are and where they come from. M1_S2A appears more frequently than M1_S2B, denoting its common status compared to the latter’s less common classification.

Occasionally, some writers choose to critique specific issues related to DEI in their field using M1_S3. As (6) shows, the writer criticizes and discusses (has yet to approach parity; .is not close to where it should be, and needs to be .) DEI-related challenges (gender equality . ethnic diversity). Move 1, in short, provides writers with a pivotal rhetorical space to present their identities, backgrounds, and overarching viewpoints related to DEI.

5.1.2. Move 2: Signal the structure of the text or propositional themes

Move 2, the only independent move without any steps, allows writers to guide readers through their DEISs by indicating structural and propositional components. It serves as a roadmap, guiding readers’ attention, as presented in (7).

# M2: Signal the structure of the text or propositional themes

(7) I describe below my current and proposed efforts in advancing diversity.

5.1.3. Move 3: Claim DEI-related competence across the board

With the primary mission of accomplishing the promotional function of the DEIS genre, Move 3 involves multiple steps for writers to claim competence, explain rationale, and showcase achievements by leveraging diverse aspects of their professional or academic experiences related to DEI, as exemplified in (8) through (17). The “across the board” part in the naming of Move 3 intends to capture such diversity as well as the fact that most steps within Move 3 are very common or common.

# M3_S1: Presenting credentials

(8) During my time at X University, I have served as chairman of graduate admissions .

# M3_S2: Contextualizing related work

(9) This year, my department is applying for an extension of a previously awarded X grant focusing on spurring women’s participation in undergraduate research.

# M3_S3A: Specifying objectives of the work

(10) My research goal is to make high-quality educational resources accessible to more people.

# M3_S3B: Situating feelings or beliefs about the work

(11) To me, encouraging diversity in the classroom is learning to improve my class so that there is a way for each student to participate and feel they are making a meaningful contribution.

# M3_S4A: Describing mentoring or advising experiences

(12) .I worked as a mentor to two bright undergraduate female students interested in exploring research as a career path. We met once a month, and I would familiarize them with ongoing research at X University and answer any questions they had.

# M3_S4B: Describing teaching experiences

(13) In my X course, I incorporate important foundational sociological theorists who have contributed greatly to shaping the discipline but are often not included in classic theory classes.

# M3_S4C: Describing research experiences

4) A significant thread of my research is based on interpreting model predictions

# M3_S4D: Describing service, outreach, or volunteer experiences

(15) I volunteered to be the X Ambassador for Thinking Globally program, where I discussed cultural aspects of Indonesia to K-12 students and university freshmen from around X.

# M3_S5: Explaining reasoning or interpreting the experiences

(16) [Therefore], working together in a room full of people with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences helps students understand the material in a much more tangible and personal way.

# M3_S6: Showcasing achievements

(17) The overwhelmingly positive feedback from students underscored the value of such inclusive pedagogical approaches in preparing future legal professionals to address complex challenges with cultural diversity.

In M3_S1, writers briefly introduce their academic or professional background, often through titles as in (8) (chairman of graduate admissions), therefore helping build their credibility. Then, M3_S2 allows writers to contextualize their work, such as the departmental initiatives mentioned in (9). To more thoroughly demonstrate their competence, furthermore, many writers use M3_S3A and M3_S3B as two common steps to articulate the “specifics” of their work, including objectives in (10) (My research goal) and feelings or beliefs in a particular environment in (11) (. encouraging diversity in the classroom .), respectively. These two steps differ from M1_S1: Expressing overall beliefs, understandings, attitudes, or aims because they refer to what the writers believe or think about DEI in a situated context, i.e., a classroom instead of a professional journey, or a specific endeavor, i.e., research instead of overall professional work.

Across M3_S4A to M3_S4D, writers describe their DEI-related experiences, including mentoring or advising (12), teaching (13), research (14), and service, outreach, or volunteer (15). M3_S4D is the only very common step within the range of M3_S3, suggesting service, outreach, or volunteer as a richer repertoire of resources for the writers to make and substantiate competence claims. It is followed by M3_S4A (mentoring or advising) and M3_S4B (teaching) as two common steps, and finally M3_S4C (research) as the only less common step. Note that writers may incorporate various discursive resources to emphasize the relationship between their work and different concepts associated with DEI, such as sex/gender in (12) (female students), inclusion/exclusion in (13) (contributed greatly . but are often not included .), and cultural diversity in (15) (cultural aspects of Indonesia).

Additionally, many writers frequently employ M3_S5 to explain or reflect on their existing work, infusing reasoning, rationale, or contemplation, as shown in (16), in which the writer justifies their teaching methods by explicating their intended values (much more tangible and personal way). Finally, M3_S6, a common step, showcases writers’ accomplishments, as presented in (17). Note the discursive resources in (17) that qualify the positive nature or impact of related achievements (overwhelmingly positive, value, inclusive), reinforcing and advancing the promotional goal of the genre.

# 5.1.4. Move 4: Propose DEI-related contributions or goals

While Move 3 offers an array of rhetorical resources for writers to claim their competence from past experiences, Move 4 enables writers to target the future, in which they articulate their prospective contributions and goals. Move 4 unfolds through three steps, illustrated in (18) to (23).

# M4_S1A: Mentoring or advising

(18) .I will seek scholarship and fellowship opportunities for minority students in my lab and in the department . guiding them on applications for the X and the X Scholars Program.

# M4_S1B: Teaching

(19) .I can contribute to the teaching of British and World Literature courses in your department.

# M4_S1C: Research

(20) I plan to continue working on this thread [of research] by developing more sophisticated, faster, and theoretically grounded tools to make interpretability more mainstream and accessible.

# M4_S1D: Service, outreach, or volunteer

(21) I would create support programs for Latino undergraduate students in STEM, inviting fellow Latino faculty, postdocs, and graduate students to offer guidance and support to upcoming undergraduate students.

# M4_S2: General initiatives

(22) I would love to learn ways that can scale my efforts, and am open to other initiatives at X University.

# M4_S3: Explaining the reasoning underlying the said contributions or goa

(23) .These programs, [of which I intend to be part], present valuable opportunities to recruit both undergraduate and graduate students.

Much like the corresponding steps in Move 3 (M3_S4A to M3_SD), each step within Move 4 addresses a specific facet of the writers’ envisioned contributions or goals, including mentoring or advising (M4_S1A), teaching (M4_S1B), research (M4_S1C), and service, outreach, or volunteer (M4_S1D). As with Move 3, writers incorporate diverse discursive resources to refer to DEIrelated concepts in Move 4, as evident in (18) (minority students) and (21) (Latino).

Notably, multiple variations exist in the status of commonality of corresponding steps in Moves 3 and 4 even though research-related steps (M3_S4C and M4_S1C) are consistently less common. However, while mentoring or advising (M3_S4A) and teaching (M3_S4B) are common in Move 3, they become less common in Move 4 likely due to the intentional generic nature of the data sources. These steps may become more prevalent and detailed when incorporated into a tailored DEIS. This explanation also applies to the very common status of M4_S2, in which the writer passionately expresses their willingness to contribute, albeit with limited specificity, as exemplified in (22). Such a positive yet somewhat “vague” offer may evolve into more concrete plans in a context-specific DEIS. Similarly, while writers frequently provide justifications and reflections for their past work (M3_S5), they may not be able to do so substantially for their future work, especially in a generic DEIS, as demonstrated by the less common status of M4_S3, as in (23).

# 5.1.5. Move 5: Closing

Through Move 5, writers wrap up their texts by either making good offers (M5_S1), often through positive emotions such as hope (looking forward to .) and dedication (I’m committed to .), as in (24), or appreciating their target audience, as in (25).

M5_S1: Making good offers (e.g., positive hope or dedication) (24) I’m looking forward to my role as a faculty member and I’m committed to always “opting in” .

M5_S2: Appreciating the audience (25) Thank you!

# 5.2. RQ2: Patterns in inter- and intra-move sequences

The combination of semi-automated Python and manual analyses did not yield predominant patterns in intra-move sequences. However, concerning inter-move sequences, it appears that DEISs tend to adhere to one of three patterns: a circular pattern $( \mathtt { n } = 2 7$ ), a linear pattern $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 2 0$ ), or no discernible pattern at all $\left( \mathtt { n } = 3 3 \right.$ ). As Table 4 shows, the circular one allows writers to cyclically shift between who they are (Move 1) and what they have done to foster and advance their DEI-related competence (Move 3). Sometimes, it also enables writers to move between their demonstrated competence (Move 3) and future contributions or goals (Move 4), thus iteratively using their past as a foundation to support their future claims.

Table 4 Patterns of inter-move sequence.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Types of Sequence</td><td>Circular</td><td>Linear</td></tr><tr><td># of Texts Sharing the Sequence</td><td>27</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Examples of the Sequence</td><td>M1-M3-M1-M3</td><td>M1-M3-M4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>M3-M4-M3M4</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 5 Top 2 Opening & concluding moves.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Top 2 Opening Moves (# of texts sharing the move)</td><td>M1 (65)</td><td>M3 (9)</td></tr><tr><td>Top 2 Concluding Moves (# of texts sharing the move)</td><td>M4 (33)</td><td>M5 (27)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Conversely, the linear move pattern allows writers to commence with Move 1, proceed to Move 3, and then seamlessly transition to Move 4. This creates a narrative sense in the overall progression of different rhetorical components. Such narrative coherence is further evident in the patterns in opening and concluding move sequences, as presented in Table 5. Specifically, 65 out of 80 DEISs begin with Move 1, wherein writers articulate their current beliefs, understandings, or feelings about DEISs or their past histories in relation to DEI. Meanwhile, 55 DEISs conclude with either Move 4 $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 3 3$ ) or Move 5 $\left( \mathbf { n } \ = \ 2 7 \right) .$ ), in which writers explicitly assert future contributions or extend positive offers for forthcoming endeavors, respectively.

Overall, both circular and linear sequences allow writers to exhibit and explicate the developmental process of their DEI experience by progressively shifting from the past to the future. This enables the target audience (e.g., search committee members) to identify who the applicant is, where they come from, and how they conceptualize DEI (Move 1); what the applicant has done in the past to engage with DEI and develop their understanding and expertise (Move 3); and what the applicant can bring to the audience and the institution they represent (Move 4). Such findings collectively underscore the flexible approaches deployed by DEISs writers in structuring and channeling rhetorical components on both macro (move) and micro (step) levels. While the diverse inter-move sequences exhibit writers’ rhetorical efforts to congruently connect these components across the general past-future continuum in their DEISs, the absence of distinct patterns in intra-move sequences reflects the infant status of the DEIS genre, which shapes its larger rhetorical situation and subsequently informs the intricate and nuanced ways in which different textual components may be flexibly executed and arranged.

5.3. RQ3: Interpretations from gatekeepers, teachers, & writers

In light of RQ 3, three themes emerged from the analysis of interview data regarding the alignment of the genre analytic findings with the four interviewees’ conceptualization and practical experience of the DEIS genre.

Table 6 Interviewee credentials, background, and experience.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Participants</td><td> Profession/Role</td><td>Background</td><td>Experience</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Chen</td><td>Department Head &amp; Former administrator at a university faculty development center</td><td>Computational Finance</td><td>W.T,E</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Gallagher</td><td>General and discipline-specific academic writing instructor</td><td>Rhetoric &amp; Composition</td><td>WT, E</td></tr><tr><td>Aaron</td><td>Faculty &amp; Author of one of the DEISs in the corpus</td><td>Theoretical Physics</td><td>WE</td></tr><tr><td>Molly</td><td>Third-year Ph.D. student</td><td>Advertising</td><td>w</td></tr></table></body></html>

$\boldsymbol { \mathsf { W } } =$ Wrote the genre. $\mathrm { T } =$ Taught the genre to others. $\mathrm { E = }$ Evaluated the genre in a “gatekeeper” capacity.

5.3.1. Positive reactions: “You’re providing super rich resources here”

The two senior faculty members, Drs. Chen and Gallagher, expressed positive views:

Dr. Chen: It’s a nice tool to support assessment, like developing rubrics that are really evidence-based . this would give me a handy tool to look at what they [job applicants] claim with some sort of validity.

Dr. Gallagher: You’re providing super rich resources here to inform material development and support the teaching of this genre . The most powerful aspect is the rich strategies [steps] here. People don’t realize how much work, or rhetorical effort, they spend on crafting their statements . And you have all kinds of strategies available . I like the sequences because they show different ways to tell good stories. And it’s useful to expose students to this sense of storytelling . It’s very eye-opening.

While Dr. Chen emphasizes using the findings for facilitating and potentially validating assessment, Dr. Gallagher highlights the findings’ potential for enriching ESP writing pedagogy and material development as they showcase the richness of writing practices and the varied ways to sequence these practices within the DEIS genre.

urthermore, Aaron and Molly, the two more junior academics, favorably comment on specific rhetorical features:

Aaron: To me, the most eye-catching part is this [M3_S5: Explaining reasoning or interpreting the experiences] . I intentionally included it in my own statement because it is very important . [As a scholar in Physics], I don’t do diversity work in my research, so whenever I claim something [in my DEIS] I try to explain and justify it .

Molly: I was taught a DEI statement is a personal statement . but diversity, equity, equality, inclusion are too abstract, too broad. How do I “personify” them? I think you are giving practical evidence to prove the many ways that a DEI statement can go personal . here like [M1_S1][M1_S2A][M1_S3B], they are all about personal beliefs, understandings, and feelings right? Something from you as a scholar. And they are frequent, right? Not saying I should or can be personal all the time [when writing my DEIS], but the biggest take-away is “yes, here are the many ways of being personal.”

Aaron’s appreciation for M3_S5 stems from his recent experience crafting DEIS, in which he purposefully employed the step to interpret his experiences (I intentionally included it .), reconciling the potential discrepancy between DEI and his theoretical research work. Recalling her previous learning-to-write experience and subsequently lamenting the “vagueness” of DEI concepts (too abstract, too broad), Molly finds the findings illuminating, particularly in clarifying how DEISs could be personalized through frequent rhetorical options grounded in personal beliefs and feelings.

The enthusiastic responses from search committee members, writing teachers, and writers underscore the imperative for developing evidence-based support mechanisms in the teaching and application of promotional genres, which aligns with the ongoing yet insufficiently addressed calls within pedagogically-oriented ESP genre scholarship (e.g., Casal & Yoon, 2023).

Importantly, at the core of such calls is the cultivation of learners’ critical genre awareness (Tardy, 2016). This awareness is potentially illustrated in Molly’s perception of “here are the many ways of being personal” as well as Aaron’s explicit reflection on “I intentionally included it.” Similarly, the “validity” (Dr. Chen) inherent in the large-scale genre analysis holds the promise to empower academic writing teachers and administrators to craft and employ responsible decisions.

5.3.2. Potential discrepancies: “Surprising and not-so-surprising” Moreover, the interviewees reacted to the status of commonality of particular steps with mixed sentiments.

Dr. Chen: If I were to speak in my former position [as the director of a faculty professional development center], my immediate reaction to [M3_S4C: Describing research experience] would be “oh wow this is surprising” because I used to teach people to craft good stories about their research . But now it makes sense. So surprising and not-so-surprising because I [as a current department head] can get a perfect sense of the candidates’ research without having to read their diversity statements.

Dr. Gallagher: It’s really surprising [regarding the common status of M1_S2A: Revealing and discussing personal history or background] even though I’ve seen people who made very compelling arguments [using M1_S2A]. But you gotta be strategic. This is a politically sensitive matter. You never know how people on search committees will react. Are they conservative? Liberal? What are the institutional or departmental vibes like? What’s the field? I always avoid doing too much and always tell my students to be very discreet..

Aaron: [M1_S3: Critiquing and reflecting on relevant issues], less common? I thought this would be very popular. I’ve seen multiple people, including myself, taking this step and organizing their statements around their critiques in a very coherent way. It was very impressive. It’s a place where people show their voice, especially with issues like underrepresentation in particular fields, or some structural issues like that, which, I believe, need radical changes. [But] I understand. People want to play safe, like avoiding the risk of being over-critical or too feisty.

The varied viewpoints of the interviewees reflect the highly contextualized and personalized nature of DEISs, complicated by the nuanced disconnects between (1) what writers believe and practice and (2) how teachers or gatekeepers perceive such practices. This phenomenon aligns with findings from prior ESP promotional genre studies that also considered stakeholder perspectives (e.g., Chiu, 2015; Kessler, 2020). A unique aspect of the findings above, however, lies in identifying discrepancies within the stakeholder’s beliefs and actions, influenced by various contextual factors, including their multiple and evolving roles as readers, evaluators, teachers, and learners. Dr. Chen’s perception of M3_S4C exemplifies the fluid nature of interpreting the writing practices and genre conventions of DEISs, highlighting how these interpretations are subject to change alongside professional growth and increasing exposure to DEI. However, Dr. Gallagher’s caution regarding M1_S2A in her writing and teaching (I always avoid doing too much . always tell my students to be very discreet) remains consistent due to the complexity of disclosing personal backgrounds and the unpredictable reactions of the intended audience. Yet, she positively acknowledges other writers’ deployment of this rhetorically delicate step (I’ve seen people who made very compelling arguments).

Furthermore, Aaron’s critical perspective on the infrequency of M1_S3 (. I thought this would be very popular) is evidenced by his personal experience (I’ve seen multiple people, including myself .), opinion (. a place where people show their voice), and belief (. which, I believe, need radical changes). Yet, his perspective is later balanced by an understanding of other writers’ desire to avoid perceived risks associated with M1_S3 (. being over-critical or too feisty).

5.3.3. Bigger questions: “It could be unfair” and “Do we need to do that much?”

Adding another layer of sophistication is the interviewees’ questions regarding the writing of DEISs or the validity of DEISs as gatekeeping tools.7

Dr. Chen: I had a tough time writing mine . I didn’t see the point . interpreting things I did from a DEI perspective. It’s not the training I received in Computational Finance, not something I felt passionate about either . Obviously right now my attitude has shifted. But it’s definitely a tough task for novices, and it could be unfair to expect people to, you know, know and speak the DEI language if they don’t know what’s going on or why they need to do this kind of thing .

Aaron: .I was selling myself as a product, and I was like dividing this product into different pieces and distributing the pieces across my cover letter, my research statement, my teaching statement, and of course this one [DEIS] . I remember when I wrote my DEI statement, and it was so hard, and I kept whispering, ‘Have I really done that much? Do we need to do that much? Will people actually read it?”

Molly: [M3_S4D] and [M4_S1D] are very intuitive to me. There’s a lot of flexibility with framing service and its relationship to DEI, right? Unlike research, which is fixed. If my research is purely theoretical, service becomes the natural common zone. But that means you need to do a lot [in service], so you have some things to write about, seriously, a lot.

Interestingly, when addressing the “bigger questions” related to the preparation (Molly), composition (Aaron & Dr. Chen), and conceptualization of DEISs (Dr. Chen, Aaron, & Molly) of DEISs, none of the interviewees (including Dr. Gallagher) link these questions to their own ethnical or racial backgrounds, despite Dr. Chen, Aaron, and Molly being academics of color. Yet, the collective issues, doubts, and uncertainties emerging from their responses critically characterize the broader, systematic challenges that faculty, especially faculty of color, have to willingly or unwillingly navigate, such as the invisible labors one has to assume when performing DEI work, meeting DEI expectations, and negotiating DEI institutional policies to eventually achieve professional success (e.g., tenure and promotion) (Ficht & Levashina, 2023; Matthew, 2016). In particular, Dr. Chen’s perspective is shaped by the absence of prior training and exposure to DEI concepts (It’s not the training I received) coupled with a lack of personal investment (not something I felt passionate about either), manifesting Koutseridi’s observation (2021) that international academics often struggle with understanding the personal and professional rationale of DEISs. However, as previously acknowledged (See Section 5.3.2), his current role as a faculty administrator has changed his attitude (. my attitude has shifted).

In contrast, the metaphor Aaron employs (. selling myself as a product . like dividing this product into different pieces .) vividly illustrates his self-doubt regarding how he should present himself across different promotional documents within his application package and, in particular, his DEIS (. it was so hard). Although Aaron possesses well-defined convictions regarding the “what” and “how” in the writing of DEISs, his ambivalence towards the genre during the writing process remains consistent. This ambivalence even prompts him to engage in introspective self-evaluation concerning his qualifications (Have I really done that much?), the rationales of integrating DEI principles into the professional responsibilities of a faculty member (Do we need to do that much?), and the efficacy of DEI as a gatekeeping instrument (Will people actually read it?), reflecting the typical difficulties L2 writers face when participating in new or unfamiliar genres (Tardy, 2016).

Molly, likewise, presented a dual perspective. On one hand, she perceived the prevalence of M3_S4D and M4_S1D as reasonably manifesting writers’ inclination to draw from a shared repertoire of rhetorical resources (service becomes the natural common zone). On the other hand, she problematized the role of DEISs in academics’ job preparation endeavors (seriously, a lot), highlighting the substantial amount of hidden burden (Matthew, 2016) academics have to wrestle with to demonstrate their DEI-related expertise and commitment to their institution’s DEI mission.

# 6. Discussion

The step-driven rhetorical move analysis revealed five recurring moves of DEISs, with two being very common (Move 1: Construct a DEI profile; Move 3: Demonstrate DEI-related competence across the board), two common (Move 2: Signal the structure of the text or propositional themes; Move 4: Propose DEI-related contributions or goals), and one less common (Move 5: Closing). These moves entail multiple steps with varying degrees of commonality, offering a diverse array of meaning-making resources for academic writers to compose their DEISs and orchestrate them based on a combination of linear, circular, or flexible sequence patterns.

While some steps (e.g., those within Move 1) appear to be notably unique to the DEIS genre, the 80 DEIS writers’ rhetorical strategies largely mirror those found in other promotional genres. For example, Bhatia (1993) found that writers of sales and job application letters deployed competence claims through what he characterized as establishing credentials. This is analogous to Move 3: Claim DEI-related competence across the board in DEISs, a move also similarly captured in Wang’s (2023) genre study on award-winning teaching philosophy statements and Kessler’s (2020) textual analysis on successful Fulbright grant statements, in which the writers in both Wang (2023) and Kessler (2020) attempted to prove their qualifications by showcasing and prioritizing various aspects of their experiences (e.g., research, teaching, mentoring/advising, and service) in terms of different promotional goals and contexts (e.g., applying for an internal teaching award vs. applying for an external grant).

However, the common status of M3_S3A and M3_S3B, as well as the very common status of M3_S5, collectively distinguish DEISs, an academic promotional genre, from job application letters (Bhatia, 1993), a professional promotional genre. These steps all involve writers in explicitly and iteratively weaving their feelings, beliefs, interpretations, justifications, and reflections as they argue why they are competent members deserving to be employed, a feature that characterizes academic discourse (Hyland, 2011), which is also identified in Wang (2023).

Beyond making various competence claims, Move 4: Propose DEI-related contributions or goals, is potentially parallel to other future-oriented rhetorical features in similar academic promotional genres, such as graduate school statements of purpose (Samraj & Monk, 2008). Yet, the applicants in Samraj and Monk (2008) tend to frame their goals as part of their motivation for applications by highlighting gaps that they must address through graduate studies, but the future goals in DEISs perform more intriguing promotional functions by allowing their writers to discuss what they can bring to their target institutions and why their contributions matter personally and institutionally.

The above findings from the textual analysis enrich previous non-ESP and ESP promotional genre research by illustrating how broad rhetorical components of DEISs can be unpacked. For example, when conveying their broad understanding of DEIrelated principles, goals, and practices (Beck, 2018; Sylvester et al., 2019; Center for Teaching & Learning at The University of Texas at Austin; The Derek Bok Center for Teaching & Learning at Harvard University), writers can express their overall beliefs, understandings, attitudes or aims (M1_S1) or problematize issues in the field (M1_S3). Moreover, writers have a diverse repertoire of options to emphasize different aspects of their DEI-related competence (e.g., Beck, 2018; Reyes, 2018; Sylvester et al., 2019), including service (M3_S4D), followed by advising/mentoring (M3_S4A) and teaching (M3_S4B), and finally research (M3_S4C). However, the extent to which writers can and should self-disclose their personal backgrounds and frame them in relation to DEI remains consistently controversial. While the common status of M1_S2A potentially corroborates the recommendations of Sylvester et al. (2019), Reyes (2018), and Beck (2018), as well as the responses from some interviewees (e.g., Dr. Gallagher), it contradicts published guidelines on the writing of DEISs (e.g., Center for Teaching & Learning at The University of Texas at Austin & The Derek Bok Center for Teaching & Learning at Harvard University), which argue against the disclosure of personal information in DEISs. These tensions therefore reflect the highly individualized and fluid approaches writers adopt to align themselves with DEI in their writing. Essentially, unveiling different aspects of one’s identity becomes not a simple matter of “dos” and “don’ts” but a rhetorical negotiation of the genre’s textual features, its projected reader reactions, its institutional norms, and its emerging status within the larger social context, all of which continues to perplex the norms and taboos of the genre.

Inevitably, such negotiation requires writers, writing teachers, and gatekeepers to possess and leverage multifaceted genre knowledge (Tardy, 2016) about and beyond DEISs. Yet, as demonstrated in the mixture of alignments and misalignments between the findings of the genre analysis and stakeholder perspectives, this endeavor has proven demanding. Resembling findings from other promotional genre research (e.g., Chiu, 2015, 2016; Connor, 2000; Kessler, 2020), the interviewees expressed conflicting and even self-contradictory beliefs and feelings by questioning whether and how particular rhetorical features should be incorporated. As such, the complexity, multiplicity, and variation within and associated with the DEIS genre raise several critical points: All interviewees in this study are well-established, wellseasoned academic writers in their disciplinary fields, but they collectively lamented the challenges of composing their DEISs, evaluating other writers’ DEISs, and conceptualizing the significance of the genre and its related implications. On one hand, although the use of the DEIS genre has intended to create and broaden equitable and inclusive opportunities for academics from diverse backgrounds in faculty job applications (e.g., Bombaci & Pejchar, 2022; Carroll et al., 2022), its composition and use might yield unwelcoming gatekeeping effects. As Dr. Chen stresses, “It could be unfair to expect people to know and speak the DEI language” when they are unfamiliar with DEI concepts and genre conventions, have not been exposed to DEI-related training, or do not see the rationale for addressing DEI in their work, an issue already explicated by critiques of DEISs (e.g., Ficht & Levashina, 2023).

On the other hand, as the interviewees uniformly recognize the genre analytic findings’ practical values for informing ESP genre pedagogy and material development, this study possesses the potential to minimize the unintended gatekeeping effects of the DEIS genre. It makes explicit and accessible how actual writers compose this genre and how other members of the academic discourse community react to the diverse range of rhetorical resources being employed. Such resources can form the foundation for developing corpus-based genre pedagogy and instructional materials, which necessitates the systematic manual annotation of rhetorical features of a corpus of sample texts representing the target genre as a precondition for classroom instruction (Wang & Lu, 2023). They can also enrich the design and implementation of corpus-based activities that aim to raise genre awareness of L2 students in academic writing instructional contexts (e.g., Casal & Yoon, 2023). With more in-depth investigations into writer experiences, audience expectations, disciplinary norms, and institutional cultures, such pedagogy (with relevant materials and activities) can empower learners to obtain “access to language, structures, and institutions that are important for their individual, academic, and professional development” (Devitt, 2019, p. 342), as is the case with a genre as high-stakes and sophisticated as DEIS.

# 7. Conclusion

As the first empirical investigation into DEISs from an ESP genre perspective, the current study contributes to the field by systematically demystifying the rhetorical features and their patterns in DEISs (RQs 1 & 2), as well as exploring relevant stakeholder perceptions (RQ 3).

Future research could unveil different linguistic features as well as their interplay with the rhetorical features of DEISs (e.g., Casal & Kessler, 2020). Doing so can productively reconcile the “function-form gap” in the field (Moreno & Swales, 2018, p. 41), an endeavor not pursued by the current study given its focus on the rhetorical features of the target genre. With a larger corpus encompassing sample texts from a more balanced selection of disciplines, future work could also investigate how rhetorical and/or linguistic features of the DEIS genre vary across disciplines (e.g., Samraj & Monk, 2008), which was not revealed in the current study.

Meanwhile, coupled with access to other promotional genres (e.g., cover letters and research statements) within an academic job applicant’s application package, future research could examine the intertextual operations of DEISs through the lens of genre systems (e.g., Tardy, 2003). Alternatively, it could also target the interdiscursive performance (e.g., Bhatia, 2004) of DEISs by exploring the interaction between the writing of DEISs and related professional practices (e.g., addressing DEIrelated topics during academic job talks or interviews).
