Despite the burgeoning research on exploring learner engagement with feedback, how second language (L2) learners' engagement with feedback in different processing conditions influences their subsequent writing development is under-explored. This study examines the effects of individual and collaborative processing (languaging) of teacher feedback on Chinese lowersecondary school EFL learners' writing development. Eighty-one students aged 13-14 with A1- A2 levels of English proficiency (according to the Common European Framework of Reference) from two classes and two experienced English teachers participated in the study. Students were provided with comprehensive teacher feedback and were asked to process feedback provided on three writing tasks through either individual written or collaborative oral languaging over six weeks. Pre-, post-, and delayed post-tests were administered. Students' writing development was analysed using complexity, accuracy, and fluency measures, as well as content and organisation writing scores. Findings showed that the two conditions did not influence students' writing complexity and fluency differently, while only the collaborative oral languaging condition contributed to students' sustainable accuracy gains. Results based on the analytic writing scores suggested that students in the two conditions significantly improved content and organisation scores over time. Pedagogical and research implications regarding implementing the two feedback processing conditions are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Written teacher fedback, one of the most conventional sources of feedback provided on second language (L2) learners writing, has been reported to positively influence 2 learners' writing development, especiall writing accuracy (Bitchener, 2012; Kang & Han, 2015). Research on the effectiveness of writtenteacher feedback on second language (L2) writing can be divided into two streams: whether and what scope/type of written correctiv feedack (WCF) should be given toL2 learners (e.g., Bitchener & Knoch, 2010; e, 2019), and how L2 learners engage with WCF (e.g., Han & Hyland, 2015; Zhang & Hyland, 2018). For the scope of feedback, while many scholars continue to promote the application of focused feedback, which targets a limited range of linguistic structures in learners' writing (e.g., Lee, 2019), some concerns have been raised about the \*narrowly defined error categories" (Ferri, 2010, p. 192). Researchers in favour of unfocuse teacher feedback (i.., commenting on all/most linguistc errs) maintain that the unfocused approach has sronger ecological validty as this is what happens i real L2clsrooms (van Beuningen et al., 2012). In comparing the effects of different tye direct, metalinguistc, or indrect) f F, the xisting cholarshi grall found no sinficant differences between the differen strategies of providing WCF on L2 learners writing accuracy gains (Kang & Han, 2015). Scholars observe that with varied research settings and designs, generalisations and clear-cut recommendations in favour of any one type of feedback are hard to draw (Bitchener, 2012; Kang & Han, 2015).

The inconclusive findings of the impact of different scope/types of fedback on L2 learners writing performance may also be due to what happens during the revision proces, namely how students engage with or process wCF (Han & Hyland, 2015). This observation led to the emerging stream of research investigating learner engagement with WCF, drawing on the tripartite engagement framework (Elis, 2010). This line of research usually describes how learners cognitively, behaviourall, and affectively engage with written teacher feedback. Despite the agreement that how learners ultimately benefit from feedback provided on their L2 writing largely depends on to what extent they respond to and engage with thefeedack (Zhang & Hyland, 2018) littl is known about how students engagement with feedback in diffrent processing conditions contribute to learners' writing development over time (Mao & Lee, 2023).

Two useful activities that have been reported to potentially contribute to L2 learners' writing gains are asking students to write down their thoughts when engaging with feedack, termed written languaging (Suzuki, 2012), or to discuss the fedback they receive with their peers, termed collaborative oral languaging (Storch & Wigglesworth, 2010). The term languaging draws on the work of Swain (2006), who defines it as the proces of making meaning and shaping knowledge and experience through language' (p. 98) Written languaging refers to the externalisation of cognitive thoughts, namely the understanding of feedback in the written form (Suzuki, 2012). Research findings have shown that writen languaging serves not only as a tool to elicit cognitive thoughts but also facilitates L2 learners noticing of feedback and helps to improve L2 learners' writing accuracy in their revised texts (Cerezo et al., 2019; shikawa & Revesz, 2020; Suzuki, 2012, 2017). The modality of writen explanation (languaging) is deemed a feasible teaching practice that can be easily implemented in clas (Jacob et al., 2020), esecially within large-size clssrooms (C.X. Peng et al., 2023) The oral modality of languaging in collaborative pairs has also been found to enhance deliberations about feedback and lead to more accurate revisions (Storch & Wigglesworth, 2010; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2012). Previous research compared the efects of different modalitie of explaining (languaging) on learners cognitie proceses and lening outomes (Jacob et al., 2020; Lachner et al., 2018), but little has been documented about how written and oral languaging of teacher feedback may ifluence 2 learners' writing performance (C. X. Peng et al., 2023).

As existing studies were mainly conducted in the tertiary-level L2 learning context, younger L2 learners with probably lower proficiency levels in the secondary school contextclearly require more scholarly attention (Lee, 2017). The current study focuses on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners at Chinese lower-secondary schools, where English is a compulsory subject and English writing assessment is mandatory in the high-school entrance exam held at the end of the ninth grade. Due to the exam-oriented instructional culture, the teaching of English writing, as a sub-component of the English subject, is usually alocated limited in-class time. Comprehensive written teacher feedback remains the dominant source of feedback, which comments on all/most lin. guistic erors and issues related to the content and ganisationf students writing (ee Bitchener & Ferri, 201). However, students writing revision is not usuall required after receiving the feedback. This lack of reciprocity (see Han, 2017) in the provision of comprehensive written teacher feedback leadsto the question of how effective the feedback is and how it may contribute to students writing development over time.

Given the importance of preparing Chinese lower-secondary EFL learners for better writing performance in their high-school entrance exam, this study introduces two novel tasks to improve the efectivenes of written teacher feedback: individual written languaging and collaborative oral languaging of written teacher fedback. It aims to investigate how these two feedback processing conditions influence Chinese lower-secondary EFL learners' writing development over time. Evidently, the literature on the effec. tivenes of written teacher feedback and the positiveffects of individual wrtten and collaborative oral languaging mentioned above were limited to writing accuracy. However, global writing aspects such as idea development and organisation are also deemed as key considerations when assessing L2 writing quality (Min, 2006), and effctive writing tass and feedback should focus on the communication of information in addition to a focus on form (Biber et al., 2011). In addition, the Compulsory Engish Education Curriculum Standards (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2022) specifies that English writing asessment should focus on not only grammatical accuracy but also the variety of vocabulary and sentence structures, as wellas the content and orga nisation of students writing. Therefore, the current study xamines students English writing development in both local i.., ccuracy, complexity, and fluency) and global (i.e., content and organisation) writing aspects.

# 2. Literature review

The following review summarises the limited empirical research on the effcts of individual written languaging and collaborative oral languaging on L2 learners' writing performance.

# 2.1. The effects of individual written languaging

Individual written languaging ass students to externalise their understanding of the teacher feedback they received in the written form while processng it (Suzuki, 2012). Suzuki (2012) explains the efect of written languaging from both cognitie and sociocultural theoretical perspectives. From a cognitive point f view, written languaging may help to reduce 2 leaners cognitive load because it can serve as external memory, given the offline nature of the written output. From a sociocultural theoretical stance, written languaging is akin to the function of private speech where L2 learnerstalk to themselves, which helps to mediate/regulate L2 learners cognitive processes when solving complex problems.

The writing languaging scholarship has mostly focused on the analysis of students overall writing accuracy in revisions (Cerezo et a. 2019; Suzuki, 2012, 2017) and theaccurate use f specific grammatical structures (Ishikawa & Revesz, 2020; Ishikawa & Suzuki. 2023). For instance, Suzuki's studies (2012, 2017) involved 24 Japanese universty EFL students with intermediate English proficiency engaging in the written languaging of direct teacher feedback. Findings suggested that written languaging helped students mostly reflect on their errors by noticing with reasons, and that noticing with reasons led to a higher proportion of accurate revisions compared to noticing only and uncertainty. Similarly, Cerezo et al. (2019) found that English major undergraduates noticed most of the teacher feedback $( 6 0 - 8 0 ~ \% )$ in a written languaging task, and greater depth of processing of feedback correlated with more successful revisions.

Examining L2 learners' accurate use of specific grammatical structures, a series of studies by Ishikawa and her colleagues generaly reported that written languaging positively contributed to Japanese universty EFL learners' acuracy gains. Ishikawa and Revesz (2020) investigated students acquisition of the present counterfactual conditional structure over four weeks. Results suggested a positive correlation between the frequencies and depth of processing shown in students' written languaging episodes with later accuracy gains in grammatical recognition tass. Including a control group without written languaging, Ishikawa and Suzuki's (2023) findings showed that students in the write languaging group significantly outperformed those in the control group in both the production and recognition of English articles in the post-tests.

These studies together manifest the positive impact of individual written languaging on L2 learners' writing accuracy gains. Notably, experiments in previous studies tended to be short term with only one wrtten languaging session (Cerezo et al., 2019; Ishikawa & Revesz, 2020; Suzuki, 2012, 2017), where the measurement of writing development was often limited to revision accuracy (Suzuki, 2012, 2017) or the accurate use/recognition of specific grammatical structures (Ishikawa & Revesz, 2020; shikawa & Suzuki, 2023). In addition, studies on written languaging have been predominantly carried out inthe university L2 learning context, while little empirical evidence was reported for L2 leaners at secondary schools, which i also a crucial context for L2 leaning. Considering the large population of L2 learners at Chinese secondary schools and the requirements of the English writing assessment in the exam-oriented instructional culture, a more comprehensive understanding of how written languaging may influence econdary school L2 learners' long-term writing performance beyond accuracy is warranted.

# 2.2. Collaborative oral languaging of feedback

Findings on how collaborative oral languaging/processing of teacher feedback improves L2 writing accuracy were gained mainly from studies asking learners to jointly writecollaborative texts but not their individual subsequent writing pieces (Broos & Swain, 2009; Manchon et al, 2020; Storch & Wiglesworth, 2010; Zhang, 2022). For instance, two studies by Storch and Wigglesworth (2010) and Wiglesworth & Storch (2012) reported that processing teacher feedback in pairs increased postgraduate ESL learners' writing accuracy in their collaboratively revised texts.

Very little research has examined how L2 learners collaboratively process fedback provided on global aspects of writing, in addition to linguistc errors. Zhang's (2022) research findings showed that collborative revision helped Chinese university EFL learners to address more meaning-related problems and be more cognitively engaged with idea development and organisation through rewriting and re-organising. Shi et al. (202) found that ollaborative processing of content fedack improved Chinese university EFL learners use of evidence, and students expressed positive attitudes towards processing content-based feedack collaborativel. These limited but encouraging results sugest that more empirical evidence on how collaborative processing of feedback leads to improvement in global aspects of writing (e.g., content and organisation) over time is required.

Furthermore, few studies have compared how different feedback processng conditions (e.g., individual versus collaborative) influence L2 learners writing performance. Two studies have provided promising effects of collaborative processing compared to in. dividual processing (Y. Kim & Emeliyanova, 2019; Mujtaba et al., 2021). Kim and Emeliyanova (2019) reported that participants in the collaborative procesing group had a higher rateof ucesul revisions than those in the individual processing group. A similar study by Mujtaba et al. (2021) further added that ollaborative fdback processing helped students make significantl fewer erors in vers and word choices in the post-est than the individual processing condition. In contrast, two other studies revealed no significant difference between the effcts f individual versus collaborative processing on writing revision (Ekanayaka & Ellis 2020; Manchon et al., 2020). However, Manchon et al.'s (2020) study included both individual and collaborative writing in their research design. Therefore, their findings may not be generalisable to individual writing conditions. Ekanayaka and Ells (2020) did notallow students in the collborative processing condition to revise their writing, which might have influenced learners retention of teacher feedback over time.

With all previous studies in this research strand conducted in tertiary-level L2 learning classrooms, more research is needed to compare how differen feedack processing conditions may benefit younger and lower-proficiency L2 lerners, fr example, secondary schoo 2 lers witing formance. Simiar to the literure onwriten anguaging, the positive ffets f collaborative rocessing of teacher feedback focused predominantly on WCF and writing accuracy. However, as highlighted in the introduction section, the evaluation of writing development must go beyond accuracy, for instance, writing complexity, fluency, and idea development and organisation (Biber et al., 2011; Min, 2006), following the official currculum standards in China and scholarly suggestions. Considering these gaps identified in the above review, two research questions are formulated to guide the current study:

1. How do individual and collaborative processing of teacher feedback contribute to Chinese lower-secondary schoo EFL leaners writing development in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency?.   
2. How do diffrent feedback processing conditions influence learners development in global aspectsof their writing (e.g., content and organisation)?

# 3. The study

Participants of this study were recruited from a public lower-secondary chool (the seventh to ninth grades) in Chongqing, China English writig instruction at this schol i grammar-focused and in preparation for the high school entrance examination. Students had litte experience engaging in writing revision or peer collaborative tass in clas before participating in this study. Eighty-one students from two classes in the eighth grade agreed to participate in this study. They were about 13-14 years old at the time of the data collction, and their English proficiency was at China Standards of English (CSE) level 3, which was equivalent to levels A1 to A2 according to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) (C. Peng, 2021). The two classes were randomly assigned to Condition 1: individual written languaging and Condition 2: collaborative oral languaging of teacher feedback (see the detaild condition design below). The two English teachers of the participating classes had 10-20 years of teaching experience at the school, and both held bachelor's degrees in English language education.

# 3.1. Data collection

The data collection of this study spanned 15 weeks over school semester, and the two feedback processing conditions designed in this study formed part of students reular English clases. Students continued receiving regular instruction from their English teachers over the school semester. Allstudents in the two clases completed three writing tasks (70-100 words) as part of their weekly writing practice (selected from their exercise books) following the English subject curriculum and engaged in individual written or collaborative oral languaging tasks over six weeks.

Before the treatment, two training sessions (90 minutes) were carried out in the two classes over two weeks. The training followed four stages adapted from Hu's (2005) writing revision training procedures. The researcher explained the nature of individual writ ten/collaborative oral languaging of teacher feedback and led students to brainstorm the benefits of these activities. Subsequently, the researcher demonstrated the two tasks with the help of the English teachers in the two classes. Students then practised either the individual or collaborative fedback processing activity before the final questions and clarificationstage. During the three treatment sessions, students in ondition 1 (individual witten languaging) were asked to write down their understanding of teacher feedback on written languaging shets following Suzuki (2012) (see the written languaging sheet in Appendix A). Students in Condition 2 (collaborative oral languaging) were allowed to ef-select a peer to collaboratively discuss how to addressteacher fdack provided on both of their writing scripts in pairs. Allparticipants in the two conditions completed these two tasks within approximately 20-25 min in class.

To assess to what extent the two conditions influenced students writing performance over time, a pre-test and a post-test were administered before and after the treatment. A delayed post-test was conducted two weeks afer the post-test (see writing prompts in Appendix B). Prompts used in these three tests were selected from the standard high school entrance English exams and agreed upon by the two English teachers. An analytic writing scoring guide adapted from the TOEFL Junior Comprehensive Writing Scoring Guides and the Cambridge English Writing Assessment for B1 was provided to the teachers (see Appendix C). This scoring guide examines both local and global aspects of writing, including grammar, vocabulary, content, and organisation sub-scores. Analytic writing scores for grammar and vocabulary were not included in this study due to the limited scope of this paper and the concern that they may collapse multiple writing features (e.g., accuracy and syntactic complexity) under the same criterion (Storch, 2009). The two English teachers had the chance to discuss their understanding of the analytic rating scale and checked their inter-rater reliability on $1 0 \%$ of all writing scripts. The agreement percentages for scoring content and organisation were $8 3 . 3 ~ \%$ and $8 7 . 5 ~ \%$ . All discrepancies were discussed until an agreement was reached before the two teachers independently graded the rest of all writing scripts.

# 3.2. Data analysis

There were 81 writing scripts for each testoccasion, totalling 243 scripts for the thre ests. For the local aspect of students writing performance, the reserchers utilised the fine-grained complexity, acuracy, and fluency (CAF) measures (Ellis & Barkuizen, 2005) to asses students writing delopment in their language use. To analyse CAF measures, students' writing scripts were firtly coded into T-units and clauses. A T-unit is defined as an independent clause with or without atached or embedded dependent clauses following Hunt (1970). This study identified a clause, either an independent or dependent clause, as a structure containing a visible subject (unless i i an imperative sentence) and a finite verb. The operationalisations of CAF measures are summarised in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, fluency was calculated as the total number of words in each composition. The measurement of complexity considered both syntactic and lexical complexity in ths study. Syntactic complexity was operationalised as the ratio of clauses to Tunits following Foster and Skehan (1996) Lexical complexity was measured by the type/token ratio by dividing the number of unique words by the total number of words in each piece of writing. Learners writing accuracy in the thre tests was analysed by two measures: the percentage of error-free clauses (EFCs) and the Weighted Clause Ratio (WCR). EFCs were defined as clauses without errors in syntax, morphology, and lexis. The percentage of EFCs was calculated by dividing the number of EFCs by the total number of clauses identified in each writing script. In the inter-coder reliability check, clauses with rrors were identified with an agrement of $9 3 . 1 ~ \%$ (Cohen's kappa $= . 8 9 0 $ ) between the researcher and a second coder. Differences were discussed before the researcher coded all writing scripts.

It has been argued that using percentages of EFCs might not discriminate wellbetween students because units with one or minor errors are given the same weight as units with many or very grave errors (Knoch et al., 2014). Therefore, a second accuracy measure, WCR, was applied to account for error gravity. Adapting the three-level eror gravity measure folowing Foster and Wigglesworth (2016), the categorisation of error gravity for each clause is described in Table 2 with examples from the data.

As shown in Table 2, each clause was assigned a score according to the gravity of the error i contained (Foster & Wigglesworth 2016). For error-free clauses, a full score of one point was given. Clauses with minor errors related to mechanics, parts of speech, determiners, and prepositions were coded as Level 1 with a score of 0.8. For level 2 errors, problems such as verb form, word order, word choice, and run-on sentence structure were included, which did not impact the comprehensibility of the clause. More severe Level 3 errors included sentence fragments and serious word order or sentence structure issues that made the clause difficult to understand. They weregiven 0.1 score. Writing accuracy was then calculated by adding all the clause ratings and dividing it by the total number of clauses in a writing script (see Equation 1). The inter-coder reliability was checked with a second coder with an agreement of $9 4 . 4 \%$ and Cohen's kappa value was.897.

Inferential statistical tests in SPss 27 (IBM Corp, 2020) were performed to analyse students' CAF measure cores and writing scores (content and organisation) over the pre-, post, and delayed post-tests. First, students initial writing scores and performance in CAF measures (at the pre-test time) in the two conditions were compared by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests or parametrict-tests depending on whether the test scores were normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test results. For those measures with equal pre-test performance, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests between the pre- and post-tests, and post- and delayed post-tests were performed to compare if leaners made significant improvements over the thre ests. For measures with ignificnly different pre-test scores, "gain scores" (Ruegg, 2015) were calculated to indicate students' writing performance changes between the three tests. As shown in Table 3, post-tt scores mius the pre-te cores quals gain score 1, which indcates the mmedat i., intrention) effect of the two feedback processing conditions. Gain score 2 is obtained by subtracting post-test scores from delayed post-test scores to show the effect of retention. These two new sets of \*gain scores" (not normall distributed) were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests to check if students' writing performance progressed differently in the two conditions.

# 4.1. CAF measures

The presentation of findings on the discourse-level analysis of students' writing development includes complexity (syntactic and lexical), accuracy (EFCs and wCR), and fluency.

Learners syntactic and lexical complexity average scores over the three test occasions are shown in Table 4. Figs. 1 and 2 show the means plots for the two types of complexity. As ilustrated in Fig 1, students syntactic complexity had minor variations over the three test occasions, with none changing more than .6. Shapiro-Wilk tes results showed that both lexical and syntactic complexity scores were not normall distributed. Hence, Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the two conditions. Results indicated thatat the pre test time, students in Condition 1 (individual wrtten languaging) had significantly lower syntactic complexity than Condition 2 (collaborative oral languaging) with a medium effect size $\mathbf { \tilde { z } } = - 3 . 0 3 4$ $\rho = . 0 0 2$ $\mathbf { r } = . 3 4 )$ . To correct students' initial syntactic complexity diffrences and compare how students' syntactic complexity changed in the two conditions over the three testing times, gain score 1 (post-test deducted by pre-test syntactic complexity) and gain score 2 (delayed post-test deducted by post-test syntactic complexity) were calculated. Mann-Whitney $\mathrm { \Delta U }$ test results showed no significant difference between students' gain score 1 $( \mathbf { z } = - 1 . 3 3 2$ $\mathbf { p } = . 1 8 3$ $\mathbf { r } = . 1 5$ and gain score 2 ${ \bf \zeta } ( 2 = - . 8 0 8$ $\mathsf { p } = . 4 1 9$ $\mathbf { r } = . 0 9 $ in the two languaging conditions. Students' syntactic complexity remained generally stable over the the tests in both conditions as the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test results showed no significant changes in syntactic complexity in both conditions throughout the three tests (see Table 5).

The means plot (seeFig. 2) for students' lexical complexity shows that allthee conditions went through a marginl fluctuation. The lowest lexil complxty scores ocurred in the post-test fer whch the lexicl omplexty rtnd more or les tthr pre-te el in the delayed post-test. Mann-Whitney U test resuls suggested that at the pre-test time, students in Condition 1 had significantly higher lexical complexity than Condition 2 with a medium effect size $\mathbf { \tilde { z } } = - 3 . 0 8 4$ $\rho = . 0 0 2$ $\mathbf { r } = . 3 4 $ . To adjust the initial lexical complexity differences in the pre-test, gain scores 1 and 2 were calculated. The comparison of the gain scores showed that students gain scores 1 and 2 did not have significant variance between the two conditions: gain score 1 $( \mathbf { z } = - 1 . 8 2 9$ $\mathtt { p } = . 0 6 7$ $\mathbf { r } = . 2 0 $ ; gain score 2 $\mathbf { \Delta } [ \mathbf { z } = - 1 . 6 4 6$ $\mathtt { p } = . 1 0 0$ $\mathbf { r } = . 1 8 $ . Therefore, the two languaging tasks did not influence learners' lexical complexity differently over the thee testing times. Results from Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tets sugested that the two conditions did not contribute to learners lexical complexity gains as students in Condition 1 had sigificantly lower lexical complexity, and students in Condition 2 did not have significant changes in lexical complexity at the post-test time (see Table 6).

The analysis of students' writing accuracy included the percentages of EFCs and WCR. The descriptive statistics for participants' writing accuracy are presented in Table7, and the means plos for the two measures areillustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. Both data sets were not normall distributed acording to the Shapiro-Wilk tes results. An oservation of the means plots suggests that, overall students in both conditions had slightly higher percentages of EFCs and WCR, indicatig more accurate writing, over the three test occasions.

A Mann-Whitney U test was performed and identified no significant difference between the two conditions FC percentages at the outset of the study $\mathbf { \tilde { z } } = - . 9 9 3$ $\mathbf { p } = . 3 2 1$ $\mathbf { r } = . 1 1$ ). Related sample non-parametric tests, namely Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests, showed that the individual written languaging (Condition 1) did not bring significant increases in learners EFCs in the post-test $( \mathbf { z } = - . 7 9 3$ $\mathtt { p } = . 4 2 8$ $\mathbf { r } = . 0 9 $ , but a significant difference was found between the post- and delayed post-tests with a small to medium effect size $( \mathbf { z } = - 2 . 3 6 6$ $\mathbf { p } = . 0 1 8$ $\mathbf { r } = . 2 6 $ . Learners in Condition 2 (collaborative oral languaging) did not have significantly higher percentages of EFCs in the post-test $( \mathbf { z } = - 1 . 2 4 2$ $\mathtt { p } = . 2 1 4$ $\mathbf { r } = . 1 4 $ , or the delayed post-test ${ \bf \left( z = - . 0 8 1 \right. }$ $\mathbf { p } = . 9 3 6$ $\mathbf { r } = . 0 1 $

For the measure of WCR, the Mann-Whitney U test results indicated no significant difference between students wCR in the two conditions at the pre-test time $( \mathbf { z } = - . 0 9 0$ $\mathbf { p } = . 9 2 8$ $\mathbf { r } = . 0 1$ ). Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test results showed that collaborative oral languaging of teacher feedback had a facilitating effect on students improvement of WCR in the post-test, meaning the gravity of the errors made was significantly less severe than in the pre-test with a small to medium effect size $\mathbf { \tilde { z } } = - 2 . 4 2 1$ $\mathbf { p } = . 0 1 5$ $\mathbf { r } = . 2 7 )$ , and this improvement in wCR was retained in the delayed post-test $( \mathbf { z } = - . 3 3 6$ $\mathbf { p } = . 7 3 7 .$ $\mathbf { r } = . 0 4 $ .

Writing fluency was operationalised as the total word count. The Shapiro-Wilk test and test of homogeneity of variance results showed that writing fluency in both conditions was normally distributed with Shapiro-Wilk p values $>$ .05. Table 8 presents the descriptive stistic of students writing flency in the thretests. The means plot in Fig. illustrates the steady gains in fluency over the three tests in the two conditions. The repeated measures ANOVA tests within the two conditions showed that students in Conditions 1 and 2 had significant fluency gains throughout the three testing times $( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1$ see Table 9).

T-test results showed that at the pre-test time, students in Condition 2 had significantly higher fluency than those in Condition 1 $\mathbf { \hat { t } } = - 3 . 1 7 7$ $\mathrm { d f } { = } 7 9$ $\rho = . 0 0 2$ CI: $- 2 2 . 1 2 5$ to $- 5 . 0 8 1 \mathrm { \Omega }$ . To adjust the pre-test time fluency difference, gain scores 1 and 2 were calculated. T-test results suggested that the two gain scores between the pre- and post-tests $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { t } = . 1 7 2$ $\mathrm { d f } { = } 1 . 2 2 8$ $\rho = 1 . 8 9 8$ CI: $- 4 . 6 9 7$ to 19.833), and post- and delayed post-tests $\mathrm { T } = 4 . 3 9 5$ $\mathrm { d f } { = } . 5 8 3$ $\rho = 4 . 3 9 5$ CI: $- 6 . 9 3 2$ to 12.681) were not significantly different. Therefore, the individual written languaging and collaborative oral languaging conditions did not inluence learners writing fluency differently.

# 4.2. Writing scores

Non-parametric tests were performed to compare the students' writing scores on content and organisation over the three test occasions because they were not normally distributed. As summarised in Table 10, noticeable increases in content and organisation scores were observed in both conditions. Results from Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests confirmed that learners in the two conditions significantly improved their content and organisation scores in the post-test (with $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 )$ , which was also retained in the delayed post-test In adition, learners in the collaborative oral languaging condition (Condition 2) further igficantly incresed their content and organisation scores in the delayed post-test. The statistical results can be found in Table 11.

To summarise, the comparison of the efects of individual written (Condition 1) versus collaborative oral languaging (Condition 2) of teacher feedback showed that students in both conditions had durable increases in content and organisation scores. Regarding CAF measures, the two conditions did not contribute to gains in complexity scores, while steady gains in writing fluency were found in both conditions with no significant dfference. Worthy of note was that only students in Condition 2 demonstrated sigificant improvement in writing accuracy measured by the fine-grained weighted clause ratio (wCR), which was not found in Condition 1.

2020; Y. Kim & Emeliyanova, 2019; Manchon et al., 2020; Mujtaba et a., 2021) focused on measuring leaners accuracy gains this study added further insights for the oitive rol of diffeent anguaging/processing condtions on young  leners aility to develop their ideas and structures.

Specifically, learners who processed teacher fedback via individual written languaging (Condition 1) did not show significant accuracy gains in their post-test measured by both EFCs and wCR. This finding does not align with the facilitating role of written languaging on students writing performance reported in previous research. However, many studies analysed if students revise their errors accurately after engaging in writen languaging (e., Cerzo et al., 2019; Suuki, 2012, 2017). Other studes (e., Ishikawa & Revesz, 2020; Ishikawa & Suzuki, 2023) focused on a limited range of linguistic structures (e.g, articles, present counterfactual conditional tructures), which may not be generalisable to accuracy gain i all grammatical structure. This study measured students overall writing accuracy in subsequent new writing tasks (post- and delayed post-test), and the discrepancy between this study and previous studies may be ascribed to how writing accuracy has been analysed.

Students engaging in the collaborative oral languaging of teacher feedback (Condition 2) demonstrated significant improvement in their writing accuracy measured by WCR. However, in some previous studies, for instance, Ekanayaka and Ells (2020) identified no significant diffrence in writing accuracy when comparing the individual and the collaborative processing groups (both receiving direct corctions) over three writing tass. It should be noted that students in the collaorative procesing group in Ekanayaka and Ellis's (2020) study were disadvantaged by not being alowed to revise after discussig teacher feedack with their peers. Manchon et al. (2020) also found no significant difference between individual and collaborative processing conditions in students' writing accuracy gains. Whileparticipants in Manchon et al. (2020) did written languaging in both conditions, the current study compared individual writen versus collaboratie oral languaging tasks. The different results between this study and Manchon et al.'s may be partially aributed to the oral and written modalitie of languaging. Lachner et al. (2018) reported that students engaging in the oral modality of languaging outperformed those who explained their thoughts in the written mode in their transfer of knowledge in subsequent tasks.

The significant accuracy gains found in the collaborative teacher feedback processing condition in comparison to the individual processing condition corroborates the positive evidence found in a number of related studies (e.g, Mujtaba et al., 2021; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2010; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2012). This result i not surprising as learners engaging in the collaborative processing of teacher feedback tasks were exposed to double the amount of teacher fedback on their writing in each writing task when they went through both writing cripts in their paired discussion (Y. Kim & Emeliyanova, 2019). The sociocultural theoretical perspective of L2 learning supports the positive effects of collaborative feedback processing.

The two feedback processing conditions can be visualise through two types of potentia scafolding opportunities (see also C. X.

Peng et al., 2023). Students in Condition 1 were required to respond to teacher feedback individually via written languaging. The provision of teacher feedback created the possibility of forming the expert-novice scaffolding, depending on whether the feedback contingently responded to students' needs and whether it fellinto the particular students' zone of proximal development (ZPD) (Lantolf et al., 2015). This potential expert-novice scafolding opportunity offered by teacher feedback is visualised in Fig. 6. The smallestcircle represents an individual novice learner's existing linguistic resources. Teacher feedback can then be viewed as the assistance provided by the expert (see the arrow pointing to the iner circle). However, individual learners may only be able to deliberate about a part of the assistance, which falls into the individual learner's ZPD (see the dotted circle).

In contrast the collaborative processing condition allowed students to discuss their questions with another peer after receiving comprehensive fedback from their teacher. The visual presentation of the integrated form of scaffolding opportunity, namely the (expert $^ +$ novice) - novice scaffolding, is shown in Fig. 7. The two smallest circles in the middle represent two learners' existing L2 linguistic resources with some overlapping knowledge. With the provision of teacher feedback (the arrow from the expert to the novices), the two students colectively scaffold (Donato, 1994) each other (the double-headed arrow) when processing teacher feedback in dyads. The two learners co-construct their ZPD, as shown by the dotted circle.

The comparison between these two types of scafflding opportunities echoes what Brooks and Swain (2009) and C. X. Peng et al (2023) argue about the incorporation of multiple expertise, which may enhance learners' cognitive capacity in solving more complex problems, namely expanding the capacity of novice learners' ZPD. Research has shown that ifferent linguistic structures may require different levels of scafolding (Aljaareh & Lantol, 1994), and some structures may be beyond young L2 learners' developmental readiness. A range of previous empirical studies highlighted the dificulties, particularl for lower L2 proficiency learners, in fully understanding teacher feedback individually e., Cerzot al, 2019). The additional expertise from er available tostudents in the collaborative oral languaging condition might have been the catalyst for students to cognitively engage more deeply with teacher feedback, as they colectively scaffold each other (Donato, 1994). The sustainable accuracy gains identified in Condition 2 in comparison to Condition 1 in this study provide evidence to support th facilitating role of collaborative oral languaging in enhancing L2 learners' understanding and retention of teacher feedback.

Additional improvements in both language use (e.g., acuracy gains in Condition 1, fluency gains in both conditions) and higher order isues at the delayed post-test were found in both conditions. These further improvements may be largely due to writing practice effects (van Beuningen et al., 2008) and the continuing regular English intruction throughout the school semester rather than the impact of the two conditions designed in the current study. It i possible thatatthe time of the delayed post-test students had practised similar writing prompts five times, and they were able to generate richer ideas and formulate clear structures of their writing, in addition to their improved grammatical competence. Within the specific instructional context, students kept receiving regular instruction from their English teachers throughout the school semester following their English subject curriculum. Moreover, students were starting to prepare for the semester's final exams at the time of the delayed post-test. Therefore, it was understandable that students could make continuous progres a few weeks afer the treatment sessions, but these gains may not be related to the two feedback-processing conditions investigated in the current study.

Despite the significant additional improvements, a lack of development was evident in students writing complexity lexical and syntactic), as these measures showed no significant improvements as a result of the two feedback-processing tasks. This may be because there were only thre treatment sessions within six weeks ivolved in this study. The efects of the two languaging tass over three treatment sessions may just not be immediately observable within a short time, namely, a school semester (Y. Kim & Eme. liyanova, 2019). Ortega's (2003) synthesis of empirical studies focusing on L2 learners syntactic complexity development shows that substantial improvement in syntactic complexity may take one year of instruction, and EFL leaners tend to have an overal slower pace of L2 development compared to learners in the ESL context.

Students' young age and low L2 proficiency may also help explain this lack of significant improvement. As Cao (2021) observed. learners with lower language proficiency may benefit les from corrective feedback than those with higher proficiency levels. The school-age students in ths study were adolescent EFL learners with limited attentional resources and working memory compared to adult L2 learners (Bailey, 2017). The competition of atentional resources between acuracy and complexity (Larsen-Freeman, 2006) may have played a role in these lower-secondary school students writing development In addition, participants in this study had itle experience engaging with written languaging tass or working collaboratively in ther traditional Englis clarooms, which made the two languaging tasks novel activities for them. Previous research has shown that when facing unfamiliar tasks, adolescent L2 learners can be disadvantaged and thus not fully engaged or perform well (Pinter, 2014). Hence, it stands to reason that young adolescent L2 learners need more time  familiaris themselves with the different feedack conditions before showing signficant improvemen n al CAF measures.

# 6. Conclusion

This study addressed some important research gaps in the L2 writing literature by investigating Chinese lower-secondary school EFL learners' writing development (both local and global aspects of writing) after engaging in the tass of individual written or collaborative oral languaging of feedback over a school semester. Findings revealed the facilitating role of both languaging activities, although as unfamiliar tasks, on young and low-proficiency L2 leaners gains in language use and idea development/organisation in their writing, and the collaborative processing condition seemed to be more beneficial for students accuracy gains than individual processing.

Due to practical and ethical constraints, there were a few limitations regarding the research design. Given the fied school timetable and the limited access the researcher had to conduct the feedback treatment sesions in the two classes, the same in-clas time was given to the individual written languaging and collaborative oral languaging conditions. This limited in-classtime probably did not allow those who worked in pars sfficient time to carefuly look at the two drafts in their pair discussion, compared to students who worked individuall. Therfore, this unequal time given to individual and collaborative tas i this study likely affcted how students engaged withfedack in the collaborative teacher feedback procesing condition, which may have influenced how leners benefited from the two tass in the long term. This study also did not include a control group tocompare how learners make progres in their writing without receiving fedback or engaging in any languaging tasks. This was because ofthe restrictions and ethical considerations of collecting data at a public Chinese secondary chool. Finding one or two more class in the same grade with similar intial English proficiency at the chosen school was not practicall feasible. Furthermore, puting young and low-proficiency L2 learners in a control group and providing no feedback on their writte texts over a schol semester may severely inluence students' learning progress and thus was considered unethical. Nevertheless, without a control group, the positive effects of the two feedback processing conditions remain indicative, as other factors, such as the continuous regular English intruction and exam preparation efect, could have influenced students writing performance. Future studies are hence recommended to overcome these limitations and include control group to provide further empiricl evidence fr the effectiveness ofthe individual and collaborative feedback processing conditions.

It should also be acknowledged that the design of the two conditions included two variables: individual versus collaborative processing, and written vers oral languaging modalitie. Therefore, indings may seem les comparable ecause the conditions were not strictly controlled. However, classoom-based research values the ecological validity of designs and does not strictl control all variables. Methodologicall, individual oral languaging using think-aloud protocols has ben widely used as an effctive tool to tap into learners' cognitive understanding of feedback when students are responding to feedback (e.g., H. R. Kim & Bowles, 2019). Researchers caution that think-aloud protocols are considered more sutable for experimental/small-scale studies conducted with mature and high-proficiency L2 learners (Adrada-Rafael & Filgueras-Gomez, 2019). In this light, requiring young L2 learners to think aloud while processing feedback was deemed less appropriat for the current classroom-base study compared to individual written languaging, given the potential noises and distractions. Future research may continue to explore the potential of individual written languaging as a less interruptive tool to elit young and low-proficiency L2 learners cognitive thoughts in response to teacher feedback, even within large-size L2 learning classrooms.

Despite these imitations and concerns, this study was one of the initil attempts to compare the effects of individual written and collaborative oral languaging of comprehensive teacher feedback. While both tas contribute o students' development in content and rganisation, collabrtive proessing of techer fack better facilitat lenrs accuray gains, although it may require more inclass time for students to go through both writing scripts in pairs. Pedagogically, L2 teachers in similar teacher-fronted and exam oriented instructional contexts are suggested to incorporate these two feedback-processing tasks in their L2 writing classes depending on their teaching objectives and in-classtime. To provide more informed suggestions to L2 writing teachers, future research may continue comparing the efects of different modalities of languaging in individual r ollaborative fdback processing conditions over a longer period. Diffrent proficiency levels and age groups can be recruited to generalise the effectiveness of individual and collaborative processing of feedback in distinct languaging modalities.
