The e  e awarded for content, language and organisation. The mean for 2A was $5 3 . 6 \%$

General comments

In geral c   ss. g- is we ab nte gd understanding of the question, giving a rsonable rason for organising the rip as well as details of the arrangements. Stronger candidates were also able to demonstrate good judgement about how much description and elaboration should be included in their lettr so as to offer a clear and brief outline of the trip for parents. The majority of candidates were able to provide adequate information about the trip, but a few misinterpreted the target audience and wrote to fellow students, which affcted content and tone. Most candidates were able to complete the task and used an appropriate style, one which was informative, explicit, polite and neither to long nor too informal.

Content

This task proved to be challenging to some candidates as they needed to decide on what to include and what not to include in the letter. Some tried to predict what parents might want to know or worry about in the trip with the use of rhetorical questions, which was inappropriate in a letter of this type.

Most candidates drew on the question prompt to provide basic details about the trip, such as logistics and lunch arrangements.Better candidates informed parents of a well-thought-out plan for the activity in a straightforward manner.Some good answers included practical ideas like safety precautions, and

Recommendations for Part A

To cope with this pat uesull, cnddes should make sure ther ids are revant to the a i      h   hy aw ease this will help them to write an appropriate answer in terms of both content and choice of language. Since candidates cannot predict what the question willbe, they should not resort to memorised ideas or extended chunks of language. These memorised chunks are very obvious to examiners as there is a clear difference between such chunks and the candidate's own style of writing and language in the rest of the text.

Part B

Paper 2 Part B comprises eight questions (Q.2-Q.9) based on the elective modules in the senior secondary English Language currculum (S4-6). In this part of the examination, candidates were required to choose one question and write about 400 words.

A total of 54,041 candidates attempted Paper 2 Part B. Their work was assessed according to three domains: Content, Language and Organisation. The mean score achieved out of a total score of 42 for each question is provided in the table below.

Question 4 on social issues was the most popular question, with about 43% choosing it. The question On spors communication (Q.2) also proved popular. The question on poems and songs was the least popular (Q.8).

The following is a summary of candidates' general performance in each question.

Question 2: Learning English through Sports Communication

This question required recounting a personal experience and encouraging others to take part in a marathon, for example My first experience running a marathon' or Lessons I learned from running a marathon' Some blogs were structured according to pre and post-marathon accounts whilethers detailed the event play-by-play. However structured, the blog needed to convey a tone of excitement consistent with accomplishing a major feat and inspire readers to sign up for a marathon; for example Is running a marathon on your bucket list?

Blogs that were well written conveyed a personal perspective on the challenges and benefits of running a marathon. Some blogs over-emphasised negative experiences of running, which seemed to contradict the aim of encouraging others to take part. Blogs which only included the benefits of sports in general and did not mention running specifically did not meet minimum task requirements.

Ouestion 3: Learning English through Workplace Communication

This question required addressing the complaint made by staff about the number of emails and texts they receive outside office hours. Candidates were given the choice of adopting diffrent stances in response to the complaint, i.e. acknowledging and supporting staff needs or acknowledging but supporting company needs. The structure of the letter needed to include opening and closing salutations appropriate to a work context and make clear arguments relevant to the complaint which could be linked back to the problem causally.

Letters that were well written showed a development of ideas that was logical and coherent for example the importance of work-life balance and how to achieve this going forward, such as hiring more staff or discussing changes in policy with regard to urgent or non-urgent emails.Some argued that because business had boomed recently, it was important to keep up with the demand and therefore an increase in salary or bonuses would be included in the next pay cheque.

connection to messages, etc. dntae chnse a softer. more apologetic and

The choice of tone was open to interpretation. Some candaaics cuvs this effect in their writing.

Question 4: Learning English through Social ssues

Question 5: Learning English through Debating

This question rquid wriin  dat peh on whether to abolish the rting f stdet class addressing the audience in the opening paragraph and presenting arguments to support their chosen stance. and closed by reiterating their overall stance regarding the issue.

Strong candidates were able to directly and firmly state their position with regard to the motion. Some candidates confused their stance however by claiming to argue against the motion but then arguing that the practice ofdiscosing clas rankings should stop. This presented some inconsisency in the organisation of the speech.

Effective debate speeches presented a number of distinct arguments, with each argument developed and justified with examples, anecdotes or personal experiences, for example, continuing an outmoded educational policy with overemphasis on results rather than progress, the negative effects on individual psychology, and the corrosion in social and interpersonal relationships.

Candidates who attempted this question were generally familiar with the language of argumentation and able to use a variety of sentence structures with more complex forms such as relative clauses and conditional forms. Some were able to use a tone consistent with a debate speech, for example using rhetorical questions.

Question 7: Learning English through Drama

This question focused on whether it i desirable for people to watch stage plays and whether viewing a videorcording of a live stage play is a good way of exposing more people to drama on stage. Candidates were given the choice of arguing for or against the idea, or addressing both pros and cons.

Some well-written articles offred personal and memorable recounts of watching video-recorded and live performances, while others gave a very good critique of the differences between live stage performance and video recordings, and the potential impact on each art form. Strong candidates were able to pick up on the specific nature of the magazine and write an article with a specific reader in mind, namely someone with an interest in drama or film. The tone could be journalisic, addressing the reader directly, or candidates could adopt a more formal, serious tone. Consistency in tone throughout the text was important. Weak students tended to talk about a play or drama in general, or wrote a film review.

There was some variability in possible interpretations of the question, for example where and how people might be given acs to stage plays. owever, th isse of watching recoding f tage plays as opposed to watching plays performed live, was important for task fulfilment.

Question 8: Learning English through Poems and Songs

For this question, candidates had to write a leter inroducing themselves as an applican, saying why they were interested in attending a poetry workshop, and why they deserved to be selected as one of the participants.

Strong candidates were able to write about themselves objectively to outine their relationship with or interest in poetry and how they could benefit from participating in the workshop. They were able to convey their individuality and strong desire to take part in the workshop with confidence and passion yet not appear overly self-possessed or oversell themselves.

Some candidates wrote about their favourite poem. Candidates needed to be careful not to appear to be analysing a poem; instead, they had to draw the reader's atention to why it was relevant to the workshop application.

# Coherence

Candidates should shape or sequence ideas within paragraphs and across paragraphs. They also need to build up a range of grammatical and lexical structures for achieving the same communicative function (g giving advice, to avoid reetition. They also need to devlop an awarnss fthe use of devices such as synonyms and superordinates to avoid unnecessary repetition of vocabulary and to help their texts hang together. The flow of ideas should be clear and logical. Longer responses should maintain coherence. If too many details are icluded without apropriate links or effective cohesive devices, there is a risk of losing the reader.
