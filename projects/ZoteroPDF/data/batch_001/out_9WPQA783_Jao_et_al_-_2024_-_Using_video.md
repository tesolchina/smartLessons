# ABSTRACT

While previous studies have focused on the outcomes of using dubbing apps to foster learner’s development of English-speaking ability, this study, grounded in cognitive apprenticeship (CA), is an investigation of the learning processes, which included modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration, involved in the use of a dubbing app, Mofunshow. Participants included 26 college students at a science and technology university in Taiwan. Data included GEPT speaking pre-and post-test scores, initial and final dubbing videos, learning logs, and reflective essays. The results showed that after engaging in video dubbing the students improved their English-speaking ability, in terms of accuracy and fluency. Coaching and modeling were ranked as the two most useful processes which supported students as they improved their English-speaking ability through repeatedly listening, echoing, and imitating. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

# 1.  Introduction

With globalization sparking innovation and competition around the world, English has been recognized as a vital tool of communication (Zhang & Liu, 2018). Many researchers have also claimed that speaking is considered to be the most crucial skill among the four language competences (listening, speaking, writing, and reading) of every language (Chien et  al., 2020; Rao, 2019). English speaking, however, can be particularly challenging for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners (Amoah & Yeboah, 2021) as it involves combining knowledge of grammar, semantic rules, and phonology competently enough to communicate with others (Abrar et  al., 2018). That is, EFL learners have to intuitively apply the holistic skills of the target language within the ongoing stream of speech to express their intended meanings.

Due to the complexity of abilities required for English speaking, many EFL learners are hesitant to speak as they fear criticism of their mistakes or feel there is little they can say (Loan & Tuyen, 2020; Shen & Chiu, 2019; Ur, 1996). The phenomenon that, after years of studying English, learners still have poor speaking skills may be attributable to ineffective strategies for cultivating English-speaking skills in school contexts (Hosni, 2014; Shen & Chiu, 2019). Constrained by limited class time and exam pressures, English teachers generally have no choice but to lecture and conduct conventional drill practices with their students (Jiang, 2017; Ngoc & Samad, 2020). This rote learning approach to language learning sharply diminishes learners’ opportunities for oral practice, particularly in authentic contexts (Chen Hsieh et  al., 2017; Rababah, 2002).

To find a solution to EFL learners’ needs for ample speaking practice in authentic contexts, different types of rehearsed speaking activities, such as video creation (Chen, 2019; Yeh, 2018), storytelling (Firdaus and Amaniarsih, 2018; Fu et  al., 2021, in press; Yang et  al., 2020), and video dubbing (Manurung & Pohan, 2019; Pamungkas, 2019), have been integrated in the language educational contexts to facilitate students’ language learning, as these activities provide authentic language-use opportunities for learners to go through constant meaningful language input and output practices (Hamada, 2016; Li, 2019; Martinsen et al., 2017). Among them, video dubbing, a type of lip-syncing with original videoclips to match the voices and lip movements of speakers via imitating and revoicing the original soundtracks, has been found effective as a pedagogical tool to enable language learners to practice speaking in authentic contexts (Florente, 2016; Matamala, 2010). Numerous benefits of applying video dubbing in the language classrooms to promote students’ English-speaking skills have also been reported in previous literature. For example, Chiu (2012) conducted an experimental study comparing the effects of video dubbing and traditional conversation courses on 83 EFL participants’ English pronunciation and intonation and found that the participants in the video-dubbing group gained higher scores in intonation and language use than the students in traditional conversation groups. Similarly, He and Wasuntarasophit (2015) found that after a video-dubbing intervention, 34 EFL participants improved their English-speaking skills in terms of comprehensibility, fluency, and accentedness. In an experimental study, Karimzadeh and Ghahroudi (2017) compared the effects of video dubbing and conventional lectures on 60 EFL participants’ pronunciation development and found that the students in the video-dubbing groups obtained higher scores in the English pronunciation tests than the participants who received conventional lectures. These studies demonstrate the positive effects of video dubbing on the development of EFL learners’ English-speaking ability.

Despite its diverse benefits on EFL learners’ English-speaking ability, the investigation of the effects of video dubbing on their English-speaking fluency and accuracy levels are understudied. Research on how the use of video-dubbing mobile applications (apps) facilitate EFL learners’ English-speaking ability is also underexplored (Klimova, 2018). Although there has been a significant growth of interest in the application of video-dubbing apps in language learning in China (Wu & Ekstam, 2021; Zhang, 2016) and Turkey (Dincer, 2018), few attempts had been made to investigate the effects of video-dubbing processes on EFL learners’ English-speaking ability to date. Therefore, to bridge these gaps, this study was grounded in cognitive apprenticeship (CA) to design the video dubbing activity in a mobile app, Mofunshow, so as to investigate the effects of video-dubbing on English-speaking ability. In addition, the processes of using video dubbing were also analyzed to understand how to better assist learners to receive adaptive and instant guidance to improve their speaking.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Theoretical framework: cognitive apprenticeship

CA is a theoretical framework that allows learners to learn from an experienced person by cognitively internalizing knowledge while engaging in an activity in which they are interested (Collins et al., 1991). It is composed of six processes (modelling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration) that break down complicated skills into multiple procedures (Collins et al., 1991; Collins & Kapur, 2006). Modelling refers to a step-by-step demonstration of a task, so that learners can develop a holistic model of the processes required to complete the task. In the coaching process, the instructor guides and encourages learners to finish the entire task by providing them with immediate support. Next, scaffolding refers to providing occasional assistance as learners to engage in learning the target skills. In the fourth process, articulation, learners articulate their knowledge and apply what they have learned to other contexts. In the reflection process, learners compare their performances with those of peers and role models and consider ways in which they can improve. Finally, in the exploration process learners critically frame problems and find solutions on their own.

CA has been widely used as the theoretical framework to support effective learning in different areas. For example, Miyauchi et al. (2020) adopted CA to design robot teaching activities to enhance junior high students’ problem-solving skills. Results showed that the students in the experimental group who learned using a robot equipped with a learning support model gained higher scores in a problem-solving test than the students who learned via traditional approaches in the control group. Similarly, Lee and Paz (2021) employed CA in English writing instructions to promote middle school students’ scientific explanation writing. The findings revealed that their causal and mechanistic reasoning, grammatical and lexical sophistication, and holistic writing were improved. Furthermore, Tsiriotakis et  al. (2021) applied CA as the teaching strategy to support elementary school students’ argumentative writing. Results indicated that the experimental group students who learned through CA-supported writing strategies got higher writing scores than the control group students who received traditional writing instruction to practice argumentative writing. These studies illustrated the positive effects of applying CA as a framework to effectively enhance a variety of students’ learning performances.

The six processes of CA (Collins et al., 1991; Dennen & Burner, 2008) can be applied to the video dubbing-assisted learning process in that the affordances of the app can provide modelling, coaching and scaffolding as learners learn in authentic contexts. Learners can enhance their language abilities through engagement in repeated listening to, reflective observation of, and imitating, what native speakers say in video clips until they can internalize and apply them in different situations (García-Cabrero et  al., 2018). The recursive process of video dubbing, thus, allows learners to reflect upon prior learning experiences and engage in new learning experiences by integrating prior knowledge into ongoing activities (Cakmakci et  al., 2020). In the processes of video dubbing with the combination of the principles of the CA framework, EFL learners can develop their language ability through repeated practice with authentic materials while gradually becoming independent of role models.

# 2.2.  Applying video dubbing to English speaking

Video dubbing, also known as lip-synchronized dubbing, enables learners to substitute the speech of characters in videos with their own voices (Lertola, 2019). It has been advocated for integration into language classrooms to support learners’ English-speaking development (Burston, 2005; Chiu, 2011; He & Wasuntarasophit, 2015; Mandasari et  al., 2017), since the features of video dubbing offer learners a chance to approximate the intonation, pronunciation, and speed of native English speakers by mimicking them (Burston, 2005; Pamungkas, 2019). Numerous benefits of utilizing video dubbing for improving learners’ English-speaking performances have also been reported, such as enhancing vocabulary knowledge, phonology, and phoneme perception (Hamada, 2016; Li,

2019; Martinsen et  al., 2017). Even though multiple positive effects of video dubbing on promoting English-speaking skills have been reported in the existing literature, there have been several pedagogical and technical issues raised in conventional video dubbing activities (Burston, 2005; Chiu, 2011; Wati & Rozimela, 2019). For example, in most of the video dubbing activities, learners were required to go through video selection, scene cropping and muting, video comprehension, dubbing practice and rehearsal, and soundtrack dubbing to make their own dubbed videos (Karimzadeh & Ghahroudi, 2017; Pamungkas et al., 2019; Putra et  al., 2018). These processes require learners to spend extensive time editing videos and soundtracks on their computers, which may constrain students’ learning only to in-class contexts and obscure their learning objectives (Danan, 2010; Mandasari et  al., 2017).

However, with the rapid development of information and communication technologies in recent years, the pedagogical and technical issues raised in the traditional video dubbing activities no longer exist (Abdous et al., 2009; Klimova, 2018; Wu, 2015). Owing to the popularity of mobile devices, various video dubbing mobile apps have been developed to help language learners practice their English-speaking ability in authentic contexts without time and space limitations (Lertola, 2019; Pamungkas, 2019). Learners are able to select the videos in which they are interested and autonomously monitor and improve their oral performance by re-dubbing ‘as often as needed to get the best possible results’ (Burston, 2005, p. 80). Related literature also indicates that video dubbing mobile apps can help overcome the limitations and obstacles, such as insufficient language-use, inadequate adaptive learning, and deficient seamless learning opportunities, in the traditional learning contexts through providing continuous authentic and student-centered learning environments (Klimova, 2018; Wu, 2015; Wu & Ekstam, 2021). The application of video dubbing mobile apps allow them to be motivated for, and engaged in, improving their English-speaking ability through self-governing their own learning process. Scholars have revealed that video dubbing mobile apps have positive effects on developing learners’ English-speaking skills in terms of pronunciation (Lv, 2017), phonetics (Wu & Ekstam, 2021), and oral performances (Zhang, 2016) while facilitating their learning confidence, motivation, and engagement (Gao & Shen, 2020 Zhang, 2016). Although previous studies have focused on the effects of video dubbing mobile apps on learners’ English-speaking performances, the ways by which the processes of applying video dubbing mobile apps affects their English-speaking ability is still underexplored. Therefore, as mentioned above, this study is an exploration of the impact of the processes of a video dubbing mobile app, Mofunshow, with CA on college students’ development of English-speaking ability in a remedial English course in Taiwan. The following research questions guided the study:

1. What is the impact of mobile-assisted supported video dubbing on EFL students’ English-speaking ability?   
2. To what extent does each CA-supported process in the video dubbing process affect EFL students’ English-speaking ability?

# 3.  Method

# 3.1.  Participants

The study involved 26 EFL non-English majors at a university of technology in Taiwan enrolled in an eight-week remedial English course that met for two hours per week. Students at this university were divided by their level (A, B, C, and D in descending order) based on their scores on the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC). The participants were graded as bottom level D and designated as elementary level learners. All participants were native speakers of Mandarin, who had been learning English for around 12 years, and none had studied abroad in an English-speaking country or had prior experience using the video dubbing app, Mofunshow. Except during class, they rarely practiced speaking English. All participated in the study voluntarily after being informed of its scope and the purpose, potential benefits of participating, and their obligations and rights. They were free to withdraw from this study at any stage.

# 3.2.  Research design

This study involved an 8-week video dubbing activity. The third researcher as the instructor of the remedial English course integrated the six processes of CA, including modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration, into the video dubbing activity to design six instructional processes. As shown in Table 1, in the first week, the students took the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) elementary-level speaking test to evaluate their initial speaking ability. GEPT is a communicatively oriented, practical, and highly reliable international standardized English test, which evaluates English learners’ four abilities (speaking, reading, writing, and listening) at all levels, including elementary, intermediate, high-intermediate, advanced, and superior (Roever & Pan, 2008). Besides, the students had to choose their most favorable video dubbing tool to use for this course after experiencing three different video dubbing apps: Mofunshow, English Dubbing Fun, and CAKE. Mofunshow was selected as the video dubbing app of choice. After the students had set up their individual accounts on Mofunshow, the instructor demonstrated the main functions of the app and helped the students become familiar with it. The students were also guided through each CA instructional process in the first week. In each of the following six weeks, students dubbed a 1 to 2-minute English video, such as an animation, drama, TED talk or documentary clip, using Mofunshow, by following the six CA instructional processes and compiled learning logs. In the second and the seventh weeks, they were required to dub the same video, Despicable Me, as their initial and final dubbing videos to examine their English-speaking progress after using the video dubbing app. The video that was selected for the students to dub was a 52-second-long clip with 55 daily used vocabularies from Despicable Me. This movie, which was made and dubbed by Americans, was marked as an elementary level video for English learners.

In the first process, modeling, the students had to choose and watch one English video repeatedly, listening and observing how the characters in the video clip spoke each sentence individually. In the coaching process, they again listened carefully to every sentence while imitating the character’s articulation and intonation while keeping pace with their speech flow, practicing until they achieved synchrony with the character’s speech. After listening and imitating, they would then start to dub the video clips. In the scaffolding process, the students compared their recordings with the original clip and revised their dubbing based on the auto-generated feedback from the Mofunshow app. In the articulation process, they were asked to evaluate their own and their peers’ dubbing works through applying what they had learned from their previous video dubbing experiences. In the reflection process, the students would receive auto-generated scores, such as total scores, completeness scores, fluency scores, and accuracy scores, and comments on their dubbing works from the app, which they used in discussion with their peers as they reflected on their performances. In the final process, exploration, the students gave five-minute oral presentations on their learning experiences with the aid of video dubbing. In the last week, all students took the GEPT speaking test as a post-test to evaluate their English-speaking progress and turned in their initial and final dubbing videos, learning logs, and reflective essays on their experiences of learning English speaking using the video dubbing app. The common errors and recurring feedback generated by the app were collected for designing a mini lesson in class for further practice.

# 3.3.  Video dubbing tool—Mofunshow

Mofunshow is a video dubbing app for assisting students to improve their English-speaking ability (Figure 1). It offered copious English materials such as songs, movies, animations, and short videos for students to emulate and dub in English. Each video is separated into different segments at the sentence level with Chinese and English subtitles, which assists learners to understand the meanings and enables students to repeatedly listen to and record each sentence as they master its pronunciation. The app also auto-generates feedback and scores as scaffolding to help users improve their English dubbing performances as they re-dub as much as they choose without time limitations. Interacting with the app thus allowed each participant to practice and improve his/her English-speaking ability independently, and the course provided the opportunity to discuss and reflect with other learners to relearn any English-speaking weakness found in the dubbing processes.

# 3.4.  Data collection and analysis

As noted, the data included students’ pre- and post-GEPT speaking test scores, initial and final dubbing videos, learning logs, and reflective essays. The GEPT speaking tests consist of 18 items divided into three sections: repeating, reading aloud, and answering questions, with a full score of 120. Two trained raters evaluated each student’s speaking test file based on GEPT speaking rubric divided into two categories: fluency (express ideas clearly and concisely without pauses) and accuracy (use of proper grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and intonation in standard English) (Roever & Pan, 2008). Each category of the speaking rubric was awarded 50 points, and the maximum attained score of each speaking file was 100 points. The inter-rater reliability reached .87. Discrepancies were solved through discussion. Paired-samples $t { \cdot }$ -test were adopted to analyze the pre- and post-scores to examine the students’ English-speaking progress with the intervention of the video dubbing app (Ross & Willson, 2017). Based on typical case sampling, the initial and final dubbing videos of the student whose scores were closest to the means of the speaking test results (Student 1) were selected for analysis to further demonstrate the English-speaking improvement that the students made through using the video dubbing app (Mujere, 2016).

Figure 1. T he interface and function of Mofunshow.

The learning logs and reflective essays were collected from the 26 students to investigate their perceptions of how engaging in the process of video dubbing activity with the support of six processes of CA allowed them to develop their English-speaking ability. The students documented their learning experiences daily based on such questions as ‘What have you been learning about?’ ‘What difficulties have you encountered today?’ ‘Which process in the video dubbing activity did you use the most to help improve today’s dubbing score?’ In their reflective essays, the students ranked the six instructional processes of CA (modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration) according to their usefulness and composed a 500-word description of their experiences with the six instructional processes.

Content analysis was applied to students’ learning logs and reflective essays for in-depth understanding of each process of video dubbing (Patton, 2002), following a sequence of coding, categorization, description, and interpretation. For example, the reflective essays were coded with key phrases, such as ‘watching the videos’, ‘listening and imitating native speakers’, and ‘checking feedback’. The researchers then organized the codes into categories and selected excerpts to illustrate students’ learning processes and experiences with the video dubbing app. Finally, the researchers drew inferences from the data and interpreted students’ experiences to reach conclusions.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  The impact of mobile-assisted supported video dubbing on students’ English-speaking ability

A paired-sample $t { \cdot }$ -test was performed to compare students’ pre- and post-intervention proficiency test scores. The independent variable was video dubbing integrated with the CA framework. The dependent variable was students’ English-speaking performances which contain two components: accuracy and fluency. Table 2 shows significant differences between students’ pre- and post-English-speaking scores in accuracy $\left( p < . 0 0 \right)$ , fluency $( p <$ .00), and overall speaking ability $\left( p < . 0 0 \right)$ . Furthermore, these results indicated a large effect size in accuracy $( d { = } 1 . 7 5 )$ , fluency $( d \mathrm { = } 1 . 6 1 $ ), and overall English-speaking ability $\langle d { = } 1 . 9 9 )$ (Cohen, 1992). These results therefore showed significant improvement in their English-speaking accuracy, fluency, and overall ability, supporting the conclusion that video dubbing with a CA framework had significant positive effects on the students’ development of their English-speaking accuracy, fluency, and overall speaking ability.

Student 1’s initial and final dubbing videos were selected as being representative of the group based on typical case sampling to further illustrate the improvement made using the video dubbing app. Figure 2 shows the transcript of Student 1’s first and last dubbing video annotated as follows: (1) bold black dot: untimely pause; (2) bolded word: stuttering; (3) underlined word: omitted ending sound; (4) the underlined and italicized word: mispronunciation; and (5) underlined and bolded word: inaccurate stress.

Table 2. S tatistical results of the students’ pre- and post-English-speaking tests $( N = 2 6 )$ .

![](img/1d0762817968a47db97fa1d7ee52028010dbc549c588848f71cadf8b34e20dd3.jpg)  
Figure 2. S tudent 1’s initial and final dubbing video transcript.

In the initial dubbing video, Student 1 paused after almost every word in order to make sure it was clearly pronounced. He also stuttered by continuously repeating the first syllable of ‘rumors’ and voicing extraneous ‘Rrrr…’ sounds. He pronounced ‘won’t’, without the ending ‘t’ sound and omitted the ‘d’ sound at the end of ‘doomed’. He also mispronounced the word ‘probably’ [ˈprɒbәbli], ‘employment’ [imˈplɒimәnt], and ‘options’ [ˈɑpʃəns] as ‘probable’ [ˈprɒbәbl], ‘empoment’ [imˈpomәnt], and ‘optgen’ [ˈɒptdʒen]. Finally, he stressed the last syllable of the three-syllable noun ‘resume’. After recursively practicing with the aid of Mofunshow, Student 1 was able to properly coordinate pausing with punctuation. The frequency of his stuttering also decreased. Furthermore, he made progress in pronouncing the ending sounds clearly, for instance, from ‘won’ to ‘won’t’ and from ‘doom’ to ‘doomed’. The ‘t’ and ‘d’ sound were spoken properly. ‘Probably’, ‘employment’, and ‘options’ were pronounced correctly. Finally, he stressed the right final syllable of the noun ‘resume’.

These differences between Student 1’s initial and final dubbing videos transcripts exemplify the progress made by most of the EFL students in this study using the video dubbing app, which enabled them to improve their English-speaking fluency and accuracy.

# 4.2.  How each CA-supported process in video dubbing affects students’ English-speaking ability

To fully understand how the use of different processes of CA in the video dubbing activity helped students improve their English-speaking ability, the researchers analyzed their learning logs and reflective essays. In their rankings of the six instructional processes of CA from 6 (the most useful) to 1 (the least useful), coaching was ranked as the most useful process followed by modeling, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration (Table 3). The details of how students benefitted from each process are further discussed as follows.

Table 3. T he students’ usefulness ranking of the six instructional processes of CA $( N = 2 6 )$ .   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Instructional processes of CA</td><td>Percentages</td><td>Ranking</td></tr><tr><td>Coaching</td><td>80.76%</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> Modeling</td><td>65.38%</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Scaffolding</td><td>53.84%</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Articulation</td><td>30.76%</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Reflection</td><td>26.92%</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Exploration</td><td>19.23%</td><td>6</td></tr></table></body></html>

# 4.2.1.  Coaching

The majority of the students ranked coaching as the most useful learning process, because they found repeated listening attentively to and imitating of native speakers’ speech sentences individually to be beneficial, as indicated in the following excerpts:

My English speaking was bad because I often paused and slipped in meaningless words such as “well” and “uh” while speaking English. In the process of dubbing activities, I repeatedly listened and imitated how the characters in the movie clips speak to practice my English-speaking ability. After doing this task, I found that I can speak English more smoothly. (S12)

How to pronounce vocabulary with correct stress was difficult to me. When I was dubbing a video, I noticed that some syllables are pronounced louder and some are not. Therefore, in order to learn how to pronounce the vocabulary in an accurate way, I clicked each sentence of the video to listen to and imitate the sounds and pronunciation of each word again and again to learn how the native English speakers pronounce every word. By doing so, I have learned the accurate pronunciation of each word. (S13)

When I was dubbing videos, I would repeatedly speak out whatever sentences I had heard from the video to practice my English-speaking ability. I found that I have more confidence in speaking English after doing this task. (S21)

As the process judged most useful for developing English-speaking ability, coaching was considered as the most useful step. The practice of repetitive listening, imitating, and speaking in coaching enabled the students to gradually reduce meaningless utterances, correct word stress, emulate native speakers, and increase their confidence in speaking.

# 4.2.2.  Modeling

Modeling was ranked as the second most useful learning process. During this process, students had to watch the videos they selected again and again as input of the target ability before they began dubbing. Almost two thirds $( 6 5 . 3 8 \% )$ of the students indicated that repeatedly watching videos allowed them to learn the usages of intonation, tones, jargon, and slang expressions in context as shown in the following excerpts:

The video I watched is so funny. I watched it many times before dubbing. After doing this task, I found that I have better understanding of the video content. It enabled me to know what tone I should use when dubbing the video. (S7)

I watched the video several times in order to get more familiar with the context of the movie clip. It helped me learn how to use different intonations in different situations when I dubbed. (S11)

When I watched the video for the first time, the conversation between the two characters was so interesting, I could not stop watching it for several times. After watching it, I had learned a lot of slang and jargon. (S19)

The process of modeling was found to be very helpful as the students were immersed in authentic contexts with meaningful and interesting video contents. By doing so, they could naturally learn the usage of tones, intonations, slang expressions, and jargon in a pleasurable learning environment. The videos they selected also encouraged them to mimick phrases many times to reach a level where they felt satisfied.

# 4.2.3.  Scaffolding

Scaffolding was ranked as the third most useful CA process. More than half $( 5 3 . 8 4 \% )$ of the students indicated that the auto-generated feedback with colored highlighting and practicing each mispronounced sound with the phonetic symbols and audio accompaniment enabled them to understand and revise their pronunciation errors. Most indicated that seeing the highlighted colors turn from red to green motivated them to keep practicing their English pronunciation. The following excerpts illustrate their reflections:

I always got yellow highlighting on words that contained long or short “a” sounds. In order to make the highlight become green, I repeatedly and carefully listened to the word that I pronounced incorrectly. After several rounds of practice, I finally got them all right and made them all green. I think the auto-generated feedback really helped me correct my English pronunciation. (S4)

I think the phonetic symbol really helped my English pronunciation a lot. It helped me understand the different ways in which “sion” and “tion” are sometimes pronounced. The phonetic symbol of sion is/-ʒən/while tion is/- $\cdot \displaystyle { \int \ d { \circ } \mathfrak { n } / }$ . After knowing the difference of [between] these two suffixes, my pronunciation became more accurate. (S1)

In the beginning of the dubbing process, it was really depressing when I got all red highlights for my dubbing feedback. I kept practicing and listening to every word until the color of the highlighting became green. Watching the colors of each sentence gradually turned from red to green, I gained a sense of accomplishment. It motivated me to keep practicing my English speaking. (S22)

In the scaffolding process, the auto-generated feedback provided guidance in the form of colored highlighting, phonetic symbols, and audio sounds. The instant color-coded feedback motivated students to revise their pronunciation mistakes through repeated trial and error. Through the recursive process of receiving feedback and guidance and self-correction, students were able to improve their English-speaking ability.

# 4.2.4.  Articulation

As the fourth most useful process, articulation involved students evaluating their own and peers’ dubbing performances. Nearly a third $( 3 0 . 7 6 \% )$ indicated that they learned from evaluating peers’ dubbings, as illustrated in the following excerpts:

I compared my own dubbing work with a peer’s and found that her pronunciation was way better than mine. She could pronounce every word clearly and fluently; therefore, I imitated how she spoke in her dubbing work. It helped me improve my pronunciation. (S16)

Although the dubbing video I evaluated got a lower score than mine in total, I noticed that his accuracy score was higher than mine. Thus, I paid attention to his pronunciation when watching his video. After watching his video, I found that I mispronounced some words such as rumors and doomed. Evaluating a classmate’s dubbing video helped me notice and adjust my own mistakes. (S21)

When I was watching my classmate’s video, I found that my English speaking was too slurred to get a high score. After that, I kept reminding myself to open my mouth while speaking English. Evaluating my classmate’s dubbing video helped me notice my speaking weakness[es]. (S20)

The process of evaluating peers’ dubbing videos enabled some students to realize their own weaknesses and strengths. Through peer evaluation, they further improved their English-speaking ability in terms of clarity, fluency, and accuracy. Giving them the chance to listen to their peers’ work allowed them to raise their awareness of their own problems so as to self-correct their own problems with critical evaluation.

# 4.2.5.  Reflection

Reflection was ranked as the fifth most useful process. More than one-fourth $( 2 6 . 9 2 \% )$ mentioned that discussing their dubbing scores with peers enabled them to realize their weaknesses and figure out ways to improve them, as shown in these excerpts:

Through discussing with my classmate, I learned how to accurately pronounce the ending sound “ed”. (S3)

After discussing with my peer, I realized that my voice is too soft and slurred while dubbing videos. Next time, I would speak up more loudly and be more confident while speaking English. (S25)

My friends and I would make fun of each other when discovering wrongly pronounced words in the dubbing videos. We would also give each other feedback. This kind of interaction enabled me to correct my English pronunciation and improve my spoken English. (S18)

Peer discussion of dubbing scores enabled the students to interactively become aware of their speaking errors and find ways to correct them. Through the interactive discussion, the students were able to effectively help each other adjust their speaking problems.

# 4.2.6.  Exploration

Exploration was ranked as the least useful instructional process of CA. Only $1 9 . 2 3 \%$ of students indicated that the final reflective oral presentation gave them an opportunity to apply what they learned from the video dubbing app to a real performance. As illustrated in the following excerpts, these students found that when preparing the oral presentation, they could examine their learning outcomes and reflect upon their learning experiences:

In the process of preparing the final presentation, I found that lots of phrasal verbs naturally came to mind. It made my speech look more professional. (S17)

In order to make my presentation look better, I not only used what I learned from the video dubbing app in my presentation but also searched online to find more vocabulary and sayings to enrich my speech content. (S14)

I tried to use the sentence patterns I learned in my speech, but not every sentence pattern I learned was applicable. Therefore, I looked up sentences in the dictionary to complete my oral presentation. (S2)

In the exploration process, students were able to apply what they had learned from using the video dubbing app in the real-world situations and further scrutinized their learning outcome through preparing and conducting oral presentations in class. Such processes enabled them to reflect upon their learning experiences in a situational context and apply what was learned from the dubbing content to the actual oral presentations.

# 5.  Discussion

As discussed in the literature review, the manner by which each process of the video dubbing mobile app affected students’ English-speaking ability still remains under-explored. Thus, the objective of this study, reflected in the research questions, was to explore how the processes of video dubbing with the support of a CA framework could facilitate EFL students to develop their English-speaking ability. The findings first revealed that the students made progress in their English-speaking ability in terms of fluency, accuracy, and overall speaking ability after using a video dubbing mobile app with CA-supported processes. Second, the findings indicated that the video dubbing processes of repeatedly listening to, watching and imitating videos, self-correcting, discussing, and reflecting upon the dubbing content effectively helped students improve their English-speaking ability. These results provide empirical evidence for the use of video dubbing mobile apps to improve English-speaking ability by illustrating the effectiveness of the combination of the CA framework and video dubbing, which was proclaimed based on process-oriented research rather than on outcome-oriented research in the previous studies (He & Wasuntarasophit, 2015; Pamungkas, 2019; Yeh et  al., 2021). The positive effects this study discerned can be attributed to three specific affordances of the integration of mobile-based video dubbing and CA: (1) contextualized and authentic video contexts, (2) repetitive practice of listening to revoicing, and (3) authentic and rich language resources (Pamungkas, 2019).

First, the video dubbing app, Mofunshow, provided abundant authentic short videos, such as 1 to 2-minute dramas, animations, TED talks, and documentaries, that allowed the participants to practice their English-speaking ability with the authentic, diverse, and meaningful materials that they were interested in. Those authentic short videos that appear in the video dubbing app provided engaging, meaningful, and contextualized spoken English contexts, which helped to increase the enojoyable exposure to native speaking utterances and language acquisition for the participants. Such a result therefore is aligned with the previous studies on the benefits of video dubbing (Burton, 2005; Danan, 2010). Second, with the purpose of obtaining higher scores in the video dubbing app, the participants were engaged in the CA-supported processes and spent much time on the repetitive practice of listening and revoicing in contextualized situations, which forced them to focus on the usage of tones, pitches, intonations, and other speaking features of the characters’ speech patterns (Chiu, 2012; Zhang, 2016). The speaking features were then arguably processed more deeply after repetitive practice with video content, which led to the improvement of speaking fluency and accuracy. This finding is consistent with the previous studies which showed that repetitive revoicing and imitation of authentic contexts enhances learners’ English-speaking ability (He & Wasuntarasophit, 2015; Pamungkas, 2019) together with other studies that have reported the beneficial role of depth of processing in L2 development (Leow, 2015, 2019). Furthermore, the affordances of the app, Mofunshow, which is set up to guide students to observe, engage in, explore and develop speaking strategies; and reflect on their own learning experiences (De Bruin, 2019; Ghefaili, 2003), with the integration of a CA framework. The app provides authentic and rich language resources, such as short English videos, auto-generated feedback for peer discussion so the participants imitate, correct, and reflect upon their English-speaking ability. This framework helped students improve their English-speaking ability through repeated imitation (coaching and modeling), self-correction (scaffolding), discussion (articulation and reflection), and reflection (exploration). The findings are therefore consistent with recent studies showing the positive effect of CA on mobile-assisted language learning (De Bruin, 2019) and echoed previous studies which show that focusing on the procedure of each process in CA results in productive interaction with the app (Andreotti, 2011; De Bruin, 2019). The integration of proper instructional guidance with practice using a well-designed video dubbing app can effectively enhance EFL students

English-speaking ability with respect to accuracy, fluency, and their overall speaking performances.

# 6.  Conclusion

While previous studies adopted CA largely in teacher-student studies, this study shows that an app can provide similar effective learning outcomes to those found in traditional applications of the CA framework in teacher-student studies. This study contributes to the literature by providing a coherence line between an app, instructional design, and student-student and teacher-student interactions, which to date has been less integrated in the literature. The mechanisms embedded in apps such as ‘Mofunshow’, ‘English Dubbing Fun’, or ‘CAKE’ can provide efficient modeling, coaching, or scaffolding grounded in CA to support adaptive learning. The adoption of CA in the mechanisms of a self-contrived reciprocal peer review writing system can also be found in the study by Yang (2011). As new technologies emerge, it is imperative to make good use of the theoretical framework to inform the design of relevant mechanisms to support students’ life-long learning.

The results of this study are important for language educators and practitioners to understand, as there has been an increasing emphasis on using technology-assisted pedagogical tools to help university EFL learners develop speaking accuracy and fluency (Gangaiamaran & Pasupathi, 2017; Kukulska-Hulme et  al., 2017; Sun et  al., 2017). These results can inform EFL educators and researchers on ways to engage EFL learners in practicing speaking the target language with authentic learning materials without the time and space constraints of the classroom through the integration of video dubbing mobile apps and how different processes embedded in the CA framework can support the development of their English-speaking ability according to their individual learning needs. Using the dubbing app in this study as an example, one of the mechanisms of CA, scaffolding, is automated and allows the precise playback of spoken interactions so students can hear what they said and compare it to what they should have said, thereby providing an effective method for the student to learn quicker than trying to remember what they were told in class where the practice was not recorded. Through video dubbing, the student can learn to speak a specific text better, through initially dubbing a video, then repeating the dubbed session later and extending the dubbed portion beyond what they had initially performed. The initial part would repeat what they learned first time, but the extended section that followed would show how they coped with new footage after they had practiced with the support of the CA framework. Effective and engaging speaking opportunities may thus become possible, as the EFL learners are immersed in meaningful contexts which are of interest to them. These positive outcomes may provide some new insights for EFL educators and researchers and help them organize a more adaptive and effective video dubbing activity in the language classrooms to facilitate students’ English-speaking ability.

Despite these positive findings, however, some limitations of this study warrant attention. First, the generalizability of the findings is limited because of the small convenience sample of EFL students recruited for this study. A larger, more representative pool of participants from the target population is suggested. Second, due to the short-term intervention of this study, the findings may be different from those of longer-term studies. More longitudinal studies are recommended to examine the applicability of video dubbing and the sustainability of the English-speaking ability gained. Third, this study did not include a control group to investigate how video dubbing with and without CA might affect English learners’ development of English-speaking ability to different extents. It is encouraged to conduct two or three groups experiments to measure and identify its effects under different experimental conditions for future studies. Additionally, future studies can compare various meaning-making elements, such as those within video text or the interaction between students and videos to probe into how or why different speaking patterns include certain features for creating meaning. Furthermore, future studies can also adopt interviews or surveys to investigate why students make certain English-speaking errors while dubbing videos or employ various video genres as speaking tests to further explore whether different video genres would affect students’ English-speaking performances.
