# The Challenge

Self‐efficacy belief is thought to develop students' academic writing performance, but does it in a foreign language context? Can we conceptualize and develop a theoretically vigorous scale with robust psychometric properties to evaluate students' self‐efficacy beliefs about academic writing in a foreign language context? This article extends previous work on assessing self‐efficacy beliefs and L2 writing by exploring the multifaceted structure of self‐efficacy beliefs in foreign language academic writing settings.

# Abstract

The first purpose of this empirical study was to assess and validate the Academic Writing Self‐Efficacy Belief Questionnaire (AWSEBQ) framed by social cognitive theory. The second purpose was to evaluate the predictive effects of different aspects of self‐efficacy beliefs on academic writing performance. Data were collected from 743 learners at a Chinese university. The assessment and validation process involved a series of rigorous confirmatory factor analyses. The results validated the hypothesized five‐dimensional structure of academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs, including linguistic knowledge efficacy (LKE), self‐regulatory efficacy (SRE), information organization efficacy (IOE), writing performance efficacy (WPE), and rehearsal and memory efficacy (RME). Model comparisons confirmed the function of self‐efficacy beliefs as a multidimensional construct, in which the five factors were intercorrelated. The results of regres sion analysis demonstrated the significant predictive effects of five dimensions (i.e., LKE, SRE, IOE, WPE, and RME) on English as a foreign language (EFL) academic writing performance. The findings suggest that self‐efficacy beliefs can explain EFL academic writing performance. This study ends by providing theoretical and empirical implications for writing assessment and the possible enhancement of EFL academic writing.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Higher self‐efficacy levels are tied to stronger motivation (Bruning & Horn, 2000; Pajares & Valiante, 2006), and more impactful use of self‐regulated learning strategies (Kim et al., 2015; Sun & Wang, 2020), and lower anxiety (Bong, 2006). These reasons may explain why learners with strong self‐efficacy beliefs can achieve positive learning outcomes, including writing in a second or foreign language (Kong & Teng, 2020; Zhang, 2013). Writing is a multifaceted and dynamic activity (Hayes, 2012); learners rely on the active use of writing‐related knowledge and positive self‐efficacy to create effective compositions (Pajares, 2003). Learners especially need to develop self‐efficacy beliefs to write (Schunk & Zimmerman, 2007; L. S. Teng et al., 2018) and control their writing behavior (for a review, see Schunk & Pajares, 2010).

Scholars have explored the relationship between self‐efficacy beliefs and writing in either first language (L1) (e.g., Pajares & Johnson, 1994), second language (L2) (Kong & Teng, 2020), or foreign language (FL) settings (e.g., L. S. Teng et al., 2018). Findings suggest that writing is a meaning‐making process based on individuals’ regulatory capacity (Pajares & Valiante, 2006). As such, students with weak beliefs in their writing capabilities may not be able to effect changes in their writing (Golombek et al., 2019). Learners possess distinct perceptions of their writing‐related actions (Zimmerman & Risemberg, 1997) as well as their overall writing competence (Bruning & Horn, 2000). These self‐efficacy beliefs influence the development of self‐regulation (i.e., managing thoughts and feelings; adopting behaviors to enable goal‐directed actions for self‐directed learning) (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) along with coregulation (i.e., an interactive process of regulatory support from peers and teachers) (Efklides, 2008; F. Teng, 2021). In addition, L2 self‐efficacy beliefs predict students’ writing performance (Golparvar & Khafi, 2021), including the extent to which learners are confident in engaging in metacognitive monitoring for text revision (Chen & Zhang, 2019), persevering in writing tasks (e.g., Woodrow, 2011), and applying self‐regulated strategies for writing (F. Teng, 2019a; F.

Teng & Huang, 2019; F. Teng et al., 2021). In particular, self‐efficacy beliefs shape learners’ writing‐related ambitions and goals (Zimmerman & Bandura, 1994). Thus, compared to their less efficacious counterparts, students who possess strong self‐efficacy beliefs can adapt to the changing demands of writing, set more ambitious goals, sustain their effort, and realize better writing outcomes (L. S. Teng et al., 2018). Such knowledge calls for attention to learners’ self‐ efficacy beliefs related to academic writing performance, which have rarely been explored.

In contrast to general writing, academic writing requires learners to display descriptive, analytical, persuasive, and critical thinking abilities. Academic writing hence presents notable obstacles to students, particularly in an FL context. Student writers may feel less efficacious in academic writing due to needing the above‐mentioned skills. Student writers require instruction on not only the acquisition of vocabulary and grammatical knowledge but also strategies to self‐reflect on the writing process (Zhang, 2013). Academic writing is an essential skill for tertiary‐level students learning English as a foreign language (EFL). However, academic writing in English remains challenging for Chinese EFL students in higher education (Reynolds & Teng, 2021). Chinese EFL university students have reported less confidence in self‐planning, self‐monitoring, and self‐reflection for academic writing (F. Teng, 2016). For example, these students tend to overly rely on grammatical rules, vocabulary knowledge, and sentence structure (Woodrow, 2011). They may thus lack self‐efficacy beliefs in their capabilities to execute actions related to academic writing.

In addition, different from general writing, academic writing is an emotional and cognitive meaning‐making activity (Reynolds & Teng, 2021). Self‐efficacy beliefs have been conceptualized as a dynamic construct; efficacy varies with task requirements (Yeo & Neal, 2006) and writing scenarios (Boscolo & Hidi, 2007). Self‐efficacy beliefs may influence students’ motivation for conducting academic writing (van Blankenstein et al., 2019). Although the need to assess self‐ efficacy beliefs regarding L2 or FL writing is apparent, the evaluation of such beliefs in academic writing in a foreign language context has received limited attention. From a social cognitive perspective, self‐efficacy beliefs cover one's perceptions or confidence about “cognitive, social, motivational, emotional, and behavioral skills,” which should be “organized and effectively orchestrated to serve innumerable purposes” (Bandura, 1994, p. 261). These arguments paint a complex picture of how self‐efficacy beliefs operate. It is accordingly essential to consider the multifaceted features of self‐efficacy beliefs relative to academic writing.

This study extends previous work on assessing self‐efficacy beliefs and L2 writing by exploring the multifaceted structure of such beliefs in foreign language academic writing settings. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we aim to conceptualize and develop a theoretically vigorous scale with robust psychometric properties to evaluate students’ self‐ efficacy beliefs about academic writing in a foreign language context. Although studies on self‐ efficacy beliefs and writing are intuitively appealing (e.g., L. S. Teng et al., 2018), a lack of evidence persists regarding the validity of associated measures in a foreign language academic writing context. We operationalize academic writing as an effort that depends on one's linguistic knowledge, self‐regulated strategies, information organization capacity, confidence in writing performance, and rehearsal and memory strategies to develop formal written work in an academic setting. A context‐specific, theoretically robust instrument based on this definition can shed light on EFL academic writing assessment. A comprehensive definition based on a synthesis of social cognitive and self‐regulation paradigms will also enrich our understanding of the multifaceted components of self‐efficacy in EFL academic writing. Second, we seek to examine the extent to which self‐efficacy beliefs predict EFL students’ academic writing performance. By investigating related effects on EFL students’ academic writing, the results clarify the function of self‐efficacy beliefs in learning academic writing. The findings can also offer insightful implications on how to empower learners by strengthening their self‐beliefs in this form of writing.

# 2 LITERATURE REVIEW

# 2.1 | Self‐efficacy beliefs

Bandura (1986) put forth a social cognitive theory of human functioning. Self‐efficacy beliefs are the core of this theory, described as individuals’ “judgment of their capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to attain designated types of performances” (Bandura, 1986, p. 391). Learners who develop a strong sense of self‐efficacy are better able to rely on their own initiative to effect changes in learning (Bandura, 1986). Self‐efficacy beliefs represent a dynamic and multidimensional construct containing personal factors (e.g., goal setting, motivation, attribution, and learning strategies) and social factors (e.g., the sociocultural system) in a variety of learning environments (for a review, see Schunk & Pajares, 2010). Self‐efficacy beliefs also influence individuals’ emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety, stress, and mood) (Pajares & Valiante, 2006).

Self‐efficacy beliefs are associated with self‐regulated learning (SRL), which refers to one's ability to exert control over learning processes through planning, goal setting, self‐monitoring, and self‐reinforcement (Zimmerman & Schunk, 2001). Skillful self‐regulators embark on learning endeavors with specific goals. Such awareness leads to a strong sense of self‐efficacy to monitor their learning process and enhance their effort in the pursuit of desired learning outcomes (Schunk & Ertmer, 2000). Self‐efficacy beliefs also play a key role in helping learners adopt agentive behaviors by stimulating their thoughts, affectation, motivation, and actions (Bandura, 1991). A reciprocal relationship appears to exist between self‐efficacy beliefs and self‐ regulated learning: a strong sense of self‐regulation enables learners to be sensitive and adapt to feedback during the learning process, and the feedback they receive shapes their self‐efficacy beliefs. Schunk and Zimmerman (1997) argued that strong self‐efficacy beliefs predict intrinsic motivation, thus helping learners further self‐regulate their learning. From a triadic viewpoint, a learner's level of self‐regulation rests on his or her personal effort to self‐regulate, behavioral performance, and nuances in environmental contexts (Zimmerman & Risemberg, 1997). Zimmerman and Schunk (2001) described SRL as comprising three parameters: personal processes, environmental events, and behavioral attributes. These parameters influence learners’ capacity to monitor the effectiveness of self‐regulatory strategies and to respond to feedback (e.g., proceeding with a strategy if it works well or seeking an alternate when it does not). Research on self‐efficacy beliefs is of great significance because it sheds light on learners’ perceived metacognitive control over their behavior and performance. However, the connection between self‐efficacy and learners’ writing performance does not seem to have received as much attention.

# 2.2 | The predictive effects of self‐efficacy beliefs on writing

Self‐efficacy beliefs predict learners’ writing performance because self‐efficacy judgments influence students’ choices, expended effort, perseverance in tackling new writing tasks, and anxiety when sustaining writing‐related effort (Pajares & Johnson, 1996; Zimmerman &

Risemberg, 1997). According to the cognitive models of writing (e.g., Flower & Hayes, 1980; Hayes, 2012), the development of ideas during writing depends on the extent to which the retrieval of content is strategically controlled to satisfy rhetorical goals. Self‐efficacious writers may show much more evidence of reflective thought during writing. For example, they develop more elaborate plans before writing, modify and elaborate these more radically during writing, and revise their initial drafts of texts more extensively (L. S. Teng et al., 2018). As argued by Boscolo and Hidi (2007), writing is an emotional and cognitive process through which affective dimensions (e.g., self‐efficacy) can predict writing performance. Individuals’ perceptions of their capabilities in articulating writing goals, embarking on writing tasks, and sustaining effort in writing may determine writing outcomes. Based on Qin and Zhang (2019), learners need to complete three interconnected tasks (i.e., planning the text, translating ideas into text, and reviewing the literary draft) to transform their thoughts, feelings, and messages into written form. In the planning stage, student writers need to generate ideas, set goals for their composition, and organize information retrieved from memory. The translation stage requires learners to convert ideas into textual output. The review stage involves evaluating and revising the text as it is translated. Collectively, these stages call for executive control over the composing process, highlighting the predictive contribution of self‐efficacy to the use of metacognitive strategies for writing (Ma & Teng, 2021; F. Teng, 2019b; F. Teng et al., 2021).

Empirical studies were conducted to explore the predictive effects of self‐efficacy beliefs on writing. Pajares and Valiante (1997) focused on a total of 218 fifth graders. They adopted path analysis to test the influence of writing self‐efficacy, writing apprehension, perceived usefulness of writing and writing aptitude on essay‐writing performance. The results showed the predictive effects of self‐efficacy on essay‐writing performance (approximately $6 4 \%$ of the variance in performance). Similarly, Jones (2008) explored the predictive role of self‐efficacy beliefs on 118 students’ writing performance using three self‐efficacy scales: task, skills, and writing approach. Posttest scores were collected from the Accuplacer essay test in a College English course. The findings revealed that self‐efficacy beliefs had far greater effects on writing achievement for weaker students than for stronger students. In an early study (Meier et al., 1984), data were from 121 college freshmen enrolled in introductory writing courses. The students completed surveys on self‐efficacy, depth of processing, locus of control, and anxiety. The results showed that self‐efficacy predicted writing performance in Phase 1 (beginning of the course) but not Phase 2 (end of course). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), Woodrow (2011) further substantiated the predictive effects of self‐efficacy beliefs on writing. SEM results also showed that anxiety could influence self‐judgments (e.g., anxiety could lead to lower self‐efficacy due to individuals’ thoughts of possible failure). Based on a review of the literature, Pajares (2003) suggested that learners’ self‐efficacy beliefs in their writing capabilities influence their writing motivation and writing outcomes. In a study exploring the multidimensionality of writing self‐efficacy (Zumbrunn et al., 2019), findings from 992 elementary and 518 high‐school American students highlighted the predictive effects of writing self‐efficacy beliefs (e.g., self‐efficacy for writing conventions) on writing success. Overall, the above findings provide partial support for the predictive role of self‐ efficacy in writing.

In general, the above literature indicates that writing self‐efficacy beliefs are crucial in the development of writing. In short, positive self‐efficacy beliefs can motivate students to adapt to increased demands in writing, sustain their writing, enhance their psychological readiness to cope with demands, and achieve better writing outcomes. Overall, learners’ self‐efficacy beliefs predict writing performance. It is therefore critical to explore how EFL learners’ writing self‐ efficacy beliefs in exerting control over their learning‐to‐write behavior can predict their academic writing performance.

# 2.3 | Writing self‐efficacy assessment research

Self‐efficacy beliefs vary in level, strength, and generality. A writing self‐efficacy scale should thus include multiple items that collectively evaluate the writing process. For example, a holistic assessment of writing self‐efficacy beliefs should consider learners’ confidence, linguistic knowledge, and self‐regulation. To gauge the adequacy of a measure of writing self‐ efficacy beliefs, it is essential to consider the dynamic features of these beliefs (Pajares & Valiante, 2006). Relatedly, a writing self‐efficacy belief scale should reflect (a) multidimensional features as informed by SRL theory (Zimmerman, 2013) and (b) the nature of L2 writing as a recursive, strategic process that requires an understanding of multidimensional features (Zimmerman & Risemberg, 1997).

Early work on writing self‐efficacy assessments can be traced back to Shell et al. (1989). Their writing self‐efficacy assessment focused on two subscales: a writing task subscale and a writing skills subscale. Items in the first scale focused on self‐efficacy in writing activities (e.g., writing an essay); those in the second scale focused on efficacy judgments of writing skills (e.g., spelling and adequate use of parts of speech). The results showed that writing skill self‐efficacy, but not writing task self‐efficacy, predicted writing performance. Such work paved the way for later studies assessing writing self‐efficacy. For example, based on Shell et al. (1989), Pajares (2007) developed the writing self‐efficacy assessment. Items were rewritten to be suited to different grade levels. In particular, items were constructed to reflect students’ judgments of their confidence in applying grammar, usage, composition, and mechanical writing skills. However, in most related studies (e.g., Pajares, 2007; Pajares & Johnson, 1996; Pajares & Valiante, 1997), writing self‐efficacy has been treated as a unidimensional construct. In response, Zimmerman and colleagues added self‐efficacy of self‐regulation to reflect learners’ perceived capacity to plan, write, and reflect on their writing (e.g., Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 1999). In addition, Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) added self‐efficacy for academic achievement and grade‐related goals. Their Writing Self‐Regulatory Efficacy Scale consisted of 25 items on which students rated their perceived capability for executing strategic aspects of writing, including planning and revising their writing, confidence in writing achievement, and setting goals to manage writing activities. The reviewed studies provide hints for developing diagnostic assessments of writing self‐efficacy. Zimmerman (2013) focused more on self‐ efficacy for writing self‐regulation, which can reflect students’ perceived self‐regulatory competence in writing. Although many writing self‐efficacy measures have assessed writing‐ related skills and tasks, these measures may not fully reveal writers’ self‐efficacy in specific dimensions of writing (Bruning et al., 2013). Relatedly, Bruning et al. (2013) assessed writing self‐efficacy based on three factors: self‐efficacy for writing ideation, writing conventions, and writing self‐regulation. The first purpose of Bruning et al.'s (2013) study was to test the adequacy of this three‐factor model of writing self‐efficacy. The second purpose was to examine relationships among these factors and other variables, including writing. The results supported the three‐factor model of writing self‐efficacy. The findings also revealed a significant correlation between writing self‐efficacy, the Liking Writing scale, self‐reported writing grades, and students’ writing assessments. These results suggest the importance of evaluating multiple features through writing self‐efficacy assessments.

Recent studies have attempted to measure the multicomponent nature of writing self‐ efficacy. For example, MacArthur et al. (2016) explored self‐efficacy for writing, achievement goal orientation for writing, beliefs about writing, and affect toward writing. In particular, self‐ efficacy for writing included 18 items measuring efficacy for writing tasks (e.g., a persuasive essay), strategies (e.g., planning and revising), and self‐regulation (e.g., evaluating progress). The results indicated that these scales could distinguish writers with different levels of performance and can clarify students’ shifting motivations related to writing. Mitchell et al. (2017) presented writing self‐efficacy as multidisciplinary and developed a tool for assessing writing self‐efficacy in scholarly writing in a nursing program; the tool was based on Bandura's Self‐Efficacy Theory Classifications (e.g., mastery, social persuasion, emotional arousal, and self‐regulatory behavior) and Flower and Hayes’ Cognitive Process Theory of Writing Classifications (e.g., planning, organizing, and finding and interpreting the literature). Similar to Jones (2008), MacArthur et al. (2016), and Zimmerman and Bandura (1994), Mitchell et al. (2017) emphasized students’ self‐efficacy vis‐à‐vis self‐regulatory competence in writing. However, the authors focused on writing in the context of a nursing program, and only a few items were directly related to evaluating nursing‐related writing.

Kavanoz and Yüksel (2016) examined students’ self‐efficacy in academic writing settings. Their assessment tool focused on two dimensions: self‐efficacy beliefs about procedural aspects of scholarly writing and self‐efficacy beliefs about the nature of the scholarly writing process. Factor analysis supported construct validity; Kavanoz and Yüksel (2016) found that evaluating self‐efficacy in academic writing can highlight the challenges scholars face in conducting academic writing and sharing their results with the international scientific community. In a recent study assessing self‐efficacy for academic writing, Golombek et al. (2019) focused on measuring self‐efficacy in the self‐regulation of academic writing. Their results showed that their scale possessed sound psychometric properties, factorial validity, and convergent validity, suggesting that evaluating students’ perceived efficacy in their self‐regulatory competence for academic writing is reliable, valid, and economic.

Other recent studies have focused on specific aspects of writing. For example, Chen and Zhang (2019) considered student writers’ self‐efficacy in terms of text revision. Scale items emphasized self‐efficacy beliefs about high‐ and low‐level revision in particular. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) demonstrated the reliability of the scale, with a high‐order model exhibiting a better model fit than a two‐factor correlated model. In another case, L. S. Teng et al. (2018) developed and validated a writer self‐efficacy scale composed of three dimensions: linguistic self‐efficacy, self‐regulatory efficacy, and performance self‐efficacy. Data from 609 Chinese university students corroborated the multifaceted structure of writing self‐efficacy. In addition, the results revealed significant correlations between writing self‐efficacy beliefs and motivation. In a similar vein, Wright et al. (2019) focused on self‐efficacy for writing and students’ beliefs about themselves as writers. CFA results substantiated the validity of their scale, and findings indicated that agency in writing could be explained by one's beliefs about their ability during a writing task and the value writers assign to that task. In another study (Locke & Johnston, 2016), researchers assessed individual self‐efficacy along with perceived collective efficacy (i.e., learners’ shared belief in their conjoint ability to execute actions for writing). The findings underscored the need to assemble a community of writing practice that highlights peer response and goal setting.

In sum, findings from the above‐mentioned studies offer empirical evidence of Bandura's (1986) argument that self‐efficacy beliefs represent “a set of differentiated set of self‐beliefs linked to distinct realms of functioning” but are not “an omnibus trait” (p. 36). Thus far, however, limited studies have assessed the multicomponent nature of self‐efficacy beliefs in academic writing, especially in meeting writing's cognitive, linguistic, and self‐regulatory demands (Golombek et al., 2019). Based on Bandura's (2006) work, an evaluation of academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs should be designed within a specific domain of functioning given a solid theoretical foundation. The conceptualization of writing self‐efficacy beliefs presented herein differs from previous studies by considering five factors in academic writing settings: linguistic knowledge efficacy (LKE), self‐regulatory efficacy (SRE), information organization efficacy (IOE), writing performance efficacy (WPE), and rehearsal and memory efficacy (RME). In particular, previous studies have paid more attention to learners’ self‐efficacy in linguistic knowledge (L. S. Teng et al., 2018), and self‐regulatory ability (Bruning et al., 2013; Zumbrunn, et al., 2019), and writing performance efficacy (L. S. Teng et al., 2018). More specifically, self‐ efficacy in information organization, that is, an ability to organize information for writing, and rehearsal and memory, that is, the ability to retain and recall past experience for writing, were not assessed in prior studies. One reason, as argued by Bruning et al. (2013), maybe the difficulty in examining writers’ self‐efficacy for meeting writing's cognitive demands.

In the present study, the first factor, linguistic knowledge self‐efficacy, reflects learners’ judgment of their capabilities in language‐related aspects useful for academic writing. This factor is grounded in social cognitive theory (Hayes, 1996), in that writing is a cognitive act that requires learners to retrieve words from existing memory resources, organize appropriate words and sentences to express ideas, and think about the discourse requirements of composition. Self‐regulatory efficacy, which is the second factor, refers to learners’ perceived capabilities to plan, monitor, evaluate, and set goals for the learning‐to‐write process (Usher & Pajares, 2008). Information organization efficacy, the third factor, reflects the need to measure learners’ confidence in processing information (Schraw & Dennison, 1994). Writing performance efficacy, the fourth factor examines learners’ judgments about their abilities to control their overt behavior in completing academic writing tasks (Zimmerman, 2013). Rehearsal and memory efficacy, the fifth factor, captures learners’ judgments of their capacity in synthesizing and memorizing key information (Hayes, 1996). From a social cognitive perspective (Zimmerman & Risemberg, 1997), this new conceptualization of academic writing self‐ efficacy beliefs reflects multidimensional features of the writing process (e.g., environmental, behavioral, and personal processes).

# 3 | THE PRESENT STUDY

A synthesis of the literature on L2 writing‐related self‐efficacy reflects the importance of exploring the roles of self‐efficacy beliefs in shaping learners’ writing processes and performance. Considering the challenges EFL student writers face and the characteristics of learning environments in which these writers are situated, it is essential to devise a theoretically sound and academic writing‐specific measurement in an FL context. In addition, earlier work did not consider the dimensions of academic writing self‐efficacy in academic writing performance. A multifaceted measure of EFL academic writing self‐ efficacy (i.e., linguistic knowledge, self‐regulatory capacity, information organization, writing performance, and rehearsal and memory efficacy) should further elucidate academic writing in an FL context.

The present study intended to evaluate how the multidynamic features of self‐efficacy beliefs influence academic writing performance. To achieve the first purpose, namely, to validate a questionnaire on writing self‐efficacy beliefs, we developed two structural models. The first was a five‐factor correlated model of self‐efficacy beliefs in EFL academic writing. This model specified 30 items across five factors that were distinct but correlated. The other model was a second‐order model in which self‐efficacy beliefs functioned as a single higher‐order common factor. This single factor accounted for the correlations among five lower‐order factors. Model comparisons shed light on the validity of the proposed scale. The second purpose was to examine the predictive effects of various dimensions of self‐efficacy beliefs on EFL academic writing performance. The findings generate pedagogical innovations for writing instruction and shed light on the characteristics of academic writing in a foreign language. The following research questions guided this study:

1. Which structural model best represents the dimensions of academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs?   
2. To what extent do the various factors of academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs predict EFL academic writing performance?

# 4 METHOD

# 4.1 | Participants

The study included 743 third‐year university students in various majors at a mid‐ranked university in mainland China (394 men, 349 women; $M _ { \mathrm { a g e } } = 2 2 . 1 5$ years, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 1 3 ^ { \cdot }$ ). The present study focused on third‐year students because they were enrolled in an English for Academic Purpose (EAP) course. Chinese was their first language, and they were learning English as a foreign language. Participants reported having more than 10 years of experience learning English, although English‐language academic writing was new to them. According to their latest school English examination, the participants demonstrated large differences in their English proficiency level, as the scores ranged from 24 to 87 $M = 8 2 . 3$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 6 . 1 5$ ), where $9 3 . 2 \%$ of participants passed the qualification examination ( $\scriptstyle \geq 6 0$ points). Chinese students often take a university English course during their first 2 years in college. University English is a basic English course that focuses on listening, reading, writing, and speaking. In the EAP course, students received instruction on academic writing. Participants were informed that the study focused on academic writing and that they would be required to complete a survey and take an academic writing test. They were assured that their results would not influence their performance in the EAP course. All participants received a coupon for taking part in this study. Among the 752 learners who completed the questionnaire, 743 responses were complete and valid.

# 4.2 | Development of the academic writing self‐efficacy belief questionnaire (AWSEBQ)

Enlightened by social cognitive theory and SRL theory, the AWSEBQ was developed as a context‐based and course‐targeted tool. The scale was intended to evaluate EFL learners’ beliefs related to linguistic knowledge, self‐regulatory capacity, information organization, writing performance, and rehearsal and memory. Items were developed in two steps: synthesizing information from interviews on a multimethod technique and consulting established studies or questionnaires on self‐efficacy beliefs. The multimethod technique included several writing tasks and semistructured interviews (Appendix A). Adding writing tasks were intended to solicit more ideas from learners than semistructured interviews would along. Having some tasks on hand was also assumed to help learners reflect on their writing practice and strategy use. Semistructured questions focused on the perceived value of learners’ writing strategies. The second step was to review previous studies and check questionnaire items (e.g., Golombek et al., 2019; Kavanoz & Yüksel, 2016; L. S. Teng et al., 2018). Learners’ responses were transcribed and analyzed before being compared with the literature. The two steps resulted in 50 items related to academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs.

Next, the 50 items were returned to the 20 students. We asked them to point out any ambiguous items. Two items were eliminated based on learners’ feedback. Two teachers in L2 writing were then invited to examine the items. They reviewed the theoretical rationale for the items and suggested the elimination of four items. We then ran exploratory factor analyses to determine items’ factor loadings and ultimately deleted four items with a value of less than 0.4 (Field, 2009). Factor loadings of the remaining 40 items fit well into the five extracted factors. Based on experts’ comments, the final version included 30 items, with a focus on five dimensions (i.e., LKE, SRE, IOE, WPE, and RME). The final survey is shown in Appendix B.

Data collection was based on a 7‐point Likert scale ( $\mathrm { { . } } 1 =$ strongly disagree, $7 =$ strongly agree). Research shows that data from Likert‐type items are less accurate when scored on 2‐, 3‐, or 4‐point scales and more accurate when scored around a 7‐point scale (Preston & Colman, 2000). Hence, the present study adopted a 7‐point scale. Cronbach's $\alpha$ reliability analyses were conducted to examine the survey's psychometric properties; values for the five factors ranged from 0.791 to 0.853, indicating acceptable reliability (Field, 2009).

# 4.3 Academic writing test

The academic writing test examined students’ abilities to provide details, solve problems, and synthesize arguments based on a given topic. This test was the writing component of a standardized test developed for all students taking the EAP course. The test required learners to write an essay based on a series of pictures. All images were related to the topic of viruses. Six pictures were presented along with a list of academic words to help learners understand each image. For example, the first picture was presented along with the words “bacteria,” “pills,” “vitamins,” “anatomy,” “donate,” “chemist,” “mask,” “beaker,” and “petri dish.” The Chinese meaning of each English word was also provided. Learners were then required to write an essay that reflected the six pictures’ content.

The marking scheme was based on a standardized rubric used by the chosen university. Two raters were responsible for scoring the test per class. There were 30 raters for the 15 classes. As this was a standardized test, participants’ identities were not revealed to the raters. The raters attended a discussion session on the scoring system and scored several writing samples to gain a better understanding of the scoring procedure. The rubric included four components: task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical response, and grammatical range and accuracy. Each component was awarded anywhere from 0 to 6 points. The maximum possible score for the test was 24 points. Cronbach's $\alpha$ for the writing test was .889, meeting the threshold for sound reliability (Field, 2009). Interrater reliability between two raters in the 15

classes ranged from 0.84 to 0.92, indicating a high degree of agreement between the two raters.   
Differences between the two raters were resolved through discussion.

# 4.4 | Procedures

The questionnaire was completed online and administered at the end of the EAP course. Administering the questionnaire at the end of the course could help learners reflect on their context‐ and course‐based strategies. The questionnaire was developed in English but translated into Chinese so that participants could understand the items more easily. The learners spent an average of 5 min completing the AWSEBQ. On the following day, the learners completed the academic writing test, which was standardized for all EAP course learners. The test was in paper‐and‐pencil format. The instructor in each class was responsible for the test, while another teacher was required to proctor it. All test sessions were completed in the same manner, and all participants received the same test instructions. One hour was allotted for test completion.

# 4.5 Data analysis

Data analysis was based on CFA conducted via the Stata program. CFA is useful for testing theoretical models and examining the factors, correlations, covariance patterns, and residual or error values within a data matrix (Byrne, 2016). As mentioned earlier, we hypothesized two structural models: a one‐factor second‐order model and a five‐factor correlated model. CFA was used to assess model fit. Model comparisons based on $\chi ^ { 2 }$ statistics and $p$ values indicated whether a single higher‐order factor self‐efficacy beliefs model could account for correlations among the five lower‐order factors. Maximum likelihood estimation was adopted to estimate parameters in CFA models because the observed variables follow a continuous and multivariate normal distribution (Satorra, 1990). Model fit indices included a $\chi ^ { 2 }$ statistic, degrees of freedom $( d f )$ , $p$ value, the ratio of $\chi ^ { 2 }$ divided by $d f ,$ root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker–Lewis index (TLI). An acceptable model fit was determined based on Kline's (2016) guidelines: GFI greater than 0.90; RMSEA less than 0.08; SRMR less than 0.08; and CFI, TLI, and NFI equal to or greater than 0.90. All indices do not need to achieve a satisfactory level in a model, but most indices must be satisfactory (Byrne, 2016). CFA was followed by linear regression analysis, which was used to examine the predictive effects of various components of writing self‐efficacy beliefs on EFL academic writing performance.

# 5.1 Descriptive statistics

The first step was to calculate descriptive statistics (see Table 1). The mean scores of the five dimensions of self‐efficacy beliefs ranged from 3.538 to 4.178; standard deviations (SD) ranged from 0.793 to 0.941. The mean score for the dependent variable (i.e., the academic writing test) was 15.596 $\mathrm { ( S D } = 3 . 3 6 6 \mathrm { ) }$ ). The writing test met the requirement for univariate normal distribution.

Before CFA, data imputation is required for structural equation modeling to deal with missing data (Carter, 2006). Following Kline (2016), the present study adopted Bayesian statistical methods to process the data. In addition, multiple imputations were employed because the traditional single imputation method could not explain the uncertainty created by the imputation process. In particular, normality was met for all the observed items (skewness $= 0 . 3 2 8 - 0 . 6 1 9$ ; kurtosis $=$ $- 0 . 1 1 4$ to $- 0 . 4 6 0 ^ { }$ ). No violation of univariate normality was detected. Multivariate normality was also tested with a critical ratio of kurtosis lower than 5. A quantile plot of Mahalanobis distance also showed that a multivariate normal distribution was met. In addition, the $p$ value based on the quantile plot of Mahalanobis distance was less than an $\alpha$ level of .001. This was evidence that no case was identified as a potential outlier. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was less than 2, indicating that correction of multicollinearity was not needed.

# 5.2 | CFA results via SEM

The second step involved CFA using SEM. Figure 1 shows the five‐factor correlated model with standardized regression weights. The findings showed acceptable standardized estimated loadings for the one‐way direction from observed variables to unobserved variables. The results thus supported that the assumed factors characterizing self‐efficacy beliefs were distinct but intercorrelated. All $p$ values for the 30‐item parameter estimates were $p < . 0 0 1$ , indicating statistical significance.

The data showed an overall acceptable model fit $( \mathcal { X } ^ { 2 } \ _ { 6 6 4 } = 2 1 4 0 . 5 5$ ; $d f = 7 1 9$ ; $p < . 0 0 1$ ; $\chi ^ { 2 } /$ $d f = 2 . 9 7 7$ ; $\mathrm { R M S E A } = 0 . 0 6 6$ , $\mathrm { S R M R } = 0 . 0 7 7$ ; $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 1 5$ ; $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 9 0 6$ ; $\mathrm { N F I } = 0 . 9 2 7 .$ ) for the first model, that is, a five‐factor correlated model. Overall, the data fit the model requirements (Kline, 2016). The findings showed that the different items loaded well on each of the hypothesized correlated factors. The results for the one‐factor second‐order model are displayed in Figure 2.

The structural coefficients of the five factors on the self‐efficacy beliefs construct ranged from 0.51 and 0.84, indicating convergent validity (i.e., the degree to which the two constructs are theoretically related) (Kline, 2016). Assessment of discriminant validity was performed by checking whether the confidence interval $\pm 2$ standard errors) around the correlation estimate between the two factors included 1.0. The value for AVE was larger than 0.05, indicating acceptable discriminant validity for a second‐order model (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The standardized residual is less than 2, indicating that the data are normally distributed. The standardized estimated loadings from observed variables to unobserved variables were all higher than 0.50, suggesting an acceptable effect size (Raykov & Marcoulides, 2008). Based on these findings, self‐efficacy beliefs functioned as a single common factor for the five factors.

The data reveal an overall acceptable model fit $( \chi ^ { 2 } _ { 6 6 4 } = 2 1 6 0 . 0 4$ ; $d f = 7 3 3$ ; $p < . 0 0 1$ ; $\chi ^ { 2 } /$ $d f = 2 . 9 4 6$ ; $\mathrm { R M S E A } = 0 . 0 7 2$ , $\operatorname { S R M R } = 0 . 0 7 5$ ; $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 2 2$ ; $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 9 0 5$ ; $\mathrm { N F I } = 0 . 9 1 0 $ ) for the second model, that is, a one‐factor second‐order model of self‐efficacy beliefs. The results indicated that the model fit the data well.

Model comparisons suggested significant differences between the two models. The differences in the $\chi ^ { 2 }$ values and df were significant $( \chi ^ { 2 } _ { \mathrm { M } 2 } - \chi ^ { 2 } _ { \mathrm { M } 1 } = 1 9 . 4 9 $ ; $d f _ { \mathrm { M } 2 } - d f _ { \mathrm { M } 1 } = 1 4$ ; $p < . 0 0 1 ,$ ), indicating that the second model had a significantly better model fit. In this case, using self‐efficacy beliefs as a higher‐order factor could account for the covariance between lower‐order factors.

# 5.3 1 Predictive effects of self‐efficacy beliefs on academic writing

To examine the predictive effects of different dimensions of self‐efficacy beliefs on EFL academic writing performance, the Pearson's correlation results are first reported in Table 2.

According to Table 2, all correlations between the five factors were significant at the .01 level, suggesting positive and significant correlations.

Table 3 presents the correlation results between the five factors and academic writing performance.

Table 3 shows significant and positive correlations between each factor and academic writing performance. Again, the significance level was $p < . 0 1$ . In particular, AWP was strongly and significantly correlated with LKE, SRE, IOE, WPE, and RME. The regression results are listed in Table 4.

In the linear regression analysis, LKE, SRE, IOE, WPE, and RME were the independent variables, and AWP was the dependent variable. The model's $R ^ { 2 }$ value was 0.543, indicating that the various dimensions of self‐efficacy beliefs explained $5 4 . 3 \%$ of the variance in AWP. The results of an $F$ test were satisfactory $( F = 1 7 5 . 3 1 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1 )$ ; that is, at least one variable among LKE, SRE, IOE, WPE, and RME predicted AWP. In addition, the multicollinearity test revealed a VIF of less than 2 for this model, indicating that multicollinearity was not a concern. The VIF value supported the subsequent use of linear regression analyses.

Table 4 and Figure 3 demonstrate the predictive effects of different factors of self‐efficacy beliefs on AWP. The regression coefficient of LKE was 0.204 ( $t = 6 . 2 0 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1 ,$ ); therefore, LKE had a significant positive effect on AWP. The regression coefficient of SRE was 0.190

# 6 DISCUSSION

# 6.1 | Assessment of academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs

The CFA results lent support to the construct validity of the proposed AWSEBQ. The present study validated academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs consisting of LKE, SRE, IOE, WPE, and RME. LKE conveyed EFL learners’ perceived competence related to lexical, syntactical, and genre knowledge. Items in LKE have conceptual overlap with the dimension of linguistic self‐efficacy suggested by L. S. Teng et al. (2018). The results support Shell et al. (1989) in that writing self‐ efficacy should include learners’ competence in writing because writing is a cognitive activity that requires linguistic knowledge. As argued by Schoonen et al. (2009), the composing process is a grammatical and orthographic encoding process that depends on linguistic means. That said, self‐ efficacy for writing conventions should include one's confidence in understanding the linguistic standards for expressing ideas and in revising the written language. A possible explanation for the contribution of linguistic knowledge is that academic writing embodies a process requiring linguistic support, including vocabulary, grammar, text organization, and academic text structures. Items measuring SRE in this study were worded similarly to items in research validating self‐efficacy belief for self‐regulatory capacity (Usher & Pajares, 2008). However, items in the present study focused more on students’ perceived capabilities in planning, monitoring, and evaluating elements required for academic writing. These findings illuminate the importance of stronger self‐efficacy when adopting planning, monitoring, and evaluation strategies during the academic writing process. Contributing to previous studies (e.g., Jones, 2008), the assessment of academic writing efficacy should include confidence in self‐regulatory strategies to accomplish writing tasks. Incorporating self‐regulatory efficacy as a dimension of self‐efficacy can shed light on learners’ agency in conducting cognitive reflection for academic writing. IOE in the present study measured learners’ execution of metacognitive control related to information organization (Schraw & Dennison, 1994). The IOE items reflected Kavanoz and Yüksel's (2016) findings that an evaluation of academic writing efficacy should include students’ perceived abilities to organize information and ideas. The WPE items considered learners’ judgments about their abilities and performance in academic writing. Consistent with MacArthur et al. (2016), the assessment of learners’ beliefs in their writing performance is essential because students who are confident in their writing abilities are more likely to find writing enjoyable. The degree to which learners could acquire writing‐related knowledge and strategies from writing courses determined their academic writing performance. RME items referred to learners’ judgment of working memory capacity, indicating that academic writing would be challenging if it were partly dependent on student writers’ retained knowledge of their abilities to recall vocabulary, grammar, genre, topic, audience, and so on. A higher level of efficacy in rehearsing and memorizing linguistic knowledge and writing strategies may inspire students to evaluate the flow and organization of their academic writing.

Overall, the AWSEBQ reflected the social cognitive theory, for which self‐efficacy is influenced by personal, behavioral, and environmental factors (Bandura, 1991). In line with Pajares (2003), self‐efficacy beliefs may explain learners’ writing‐related perceptions because learners should be perceived “as proactive and self‐regulating rather than as reactive and controlled by biological or environmental forces” (p. 139). It is thus crucial to consider academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs. For example, evaluations of academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs should focus on multidimensional aspects of the writing process (e.g., personal, behavioral, and environmental processes) (Bandura, 1991). Consistent with Golparvar and Khafi (2021), self‐efficacy beliefs, including linguistic self‐efficacy, self‐regulatory efficacy, and performance self‐efficacy, should be considered in writing self‐efficacy. Positive correlations between the various hypothesized factors corroborated the claim that self‐efficacy beliefs provide a framework for understanding learners’ perceptions of their control‐related decisions in writing (Bruning et al., 2013; Zimmerman & Risemberg, 1997).

This study hypothesized two models: a five‐factor correlated model (Model 1) and a one‐ factor second‐order model (Model 2). Model comparisons showed that Model 2 had a better model fit. Significant correlations between the five subcategories fell under the overarching construct of self‐efficacy beliefs. The results thus establish an empirical foundation for multifactorial models of academic writing self‐efficacy. The logic underlying the one‐factor second‐order model, which divided writing self‐efficacy into LKE, SRE, IOE, WPE, and RME, is that student writers sort their perceived capabilities in writing (and conducting writing‐related tasks) into recognizable categories. The rationale behind the one‐factor second‐order model, which conceptualized self‐efficacy beliefs as having multiple features, aligns with cognitive models describing writing as an intentional and systematic process involving detection, modification, evaluation, and refinement (Chen & Zhang, 2019). These findings imply that clarifying both categories would be theoretically and practically meaningful. According to the cognitive models of writing (e.g., Flower & Hayes, 1980; Hayes, 1996, 2012), writers leverage topical and world knowledge to plan, generate, organize, and review writing‐related ideas. We argue that the assessment of writing self‐efficacy beliefs is directly tied to multiple components of the craft of writing, including translating ideas into linguistic forms through knowledge of writing mechanics, self‐regulatory competence in writing, writing performance, information organization, and available memory resources for writing.

# 6.2 | The predictive effects of self‐efficacy beliefs on academic writing performance

The findings support the role of multidimensional self‐efficacy accounts on writing performance, but the contribution of each component of the AWSEBQ varies widely. Hence, the findings offer preliminary support for the claim that academic writing achievement in an EFL context is contingent upon learners’ beliefs and perceptions of linguistic knowledge, self‐ regulation, memory, writing performance, and information organization in academic writing. In line with previous studies (e.g., Golparvar & Khafi, 2021; Jones, 2008; Kong & Teng, 2020; Pajares & Valiante, 1997; Zumbrunn et al., 2019), self‐efficacy beliefs play a key role in mobilizing, directing, stimulating, motivating, and sustaining learners’ effort, thus predicting writing performance.

Although the contribution of each component varies widely, we may need to discuss their predictive role in academic writing. First, the findings related to LKE supported the use of linguistic and writing knowledge as a key factor in academic writing performance (e.g., Boscolo & Hidi, 2007; Meier et al., 1984; Zimmermann & Bandura, 1994). The present study highlights linguistic knowledge, including vocabulary, grammar, and orthographic knowledge, as a constituent skill for outstanding academic writing performance. Consistent with the work by Golparvar and Khafi (2021) and L. S. Teng et al. (2018), higher self‐efficacy in linguistic knowledge led learners to devote more attention to writing‐related structures. This outcome positively influenced the quality of learners’ final output. A possible explanation is that writing assessment in an FL context entails students’ linguistic competence, including lexical, syntactic, and grammatical knowledge. Second, self‐regulatory efficacy significantly predicted AWP. This result supports previous findings underscoring the essential role of metacognitive control in fostering active writing engagement (Ma & Teng, 2021; F. Teng, 2016, 2019b; F. Teng et al., 2021). The results also reflected Flower and Hayes's (1980) cognitive model of writing, which highlighted various cognitive processes or strategies (e.g., planning, translating, and reviewing). As argued by Travers et al. (2015), learners’ metacognitive strategy awareness in evaluation and self‐reflection enhances learning outcomes. These findings highlight the role of metacognitive readiness in participating in academic writing. Of note, metacognitive mechanisms were found to play an executive part in the academic writing process. Student writers with high self‐efficacy for regulating their writing are presumably more likely to take control of the composing process, which will positively affect their academic writing performance. This trend underscores the relationship between self‐efficacy and self‐ regulatory strategies (Golparvar & Khafi, 2021; Magogwe & Oliver, 2007; Sun & Wang, 2020). Evidently, student writers who are more confident in taking control of their writing exhibit proactive behaviors and take initiative in academic writing. Third, IOE focused on organizing, elaborating, and summarizing information. Learners’ abilities to assess, store, and analyze information are critical to writing performance, as Kenkel and Yates (2009) suggested. A low level of self‐efficacy in information organization may be associated with reluctance around potential revision. Fourth, WPE predicted students’ academic writing performance. In line with research by L. S. Teng et al. (2018), learners who perceived external rewards for writing or who positively judged their capacity to meet writing requirements may experience stronger writing performance. Students with stronger writing‐related self‐efficacy were also more likely to choose and organize relevant information and to build meaningful connections for the written output. Finally, RME significantly affected academic writing performance; in this case, remembering certain information or course material was essential to academic writing. Student writers’ ability to memorize information may lead them to more effectively activate knowledge processing for academic writing. A possible explanation is that students in an FL context are more reliant on their recall of linguistic resources when writing. Those with better recall of these resources may thus achieve better academic writing performance.

Taken together, the findings lent support to the predictive effects of academic writing self‐efficacy beliefs on EFL students’ academic writing performance. These results substantiate prior studies revealing positive predictive relationships between writing self‐ efficacy and writing outcomes (Golparvar & Khafi, 2021; Pajares & Johnson, 1996; Pajares & Valiante, 1997). An interesting pattern emerged in the diverse predictions of academic writing self‐efficacy on students’ academic writing scores. Supporting Pajares and Valiante (2006) and MacArthur et al. (2016), students’ perceived efficacy in writing skills and tasks determines their writing performance. Perceived self‐regulation of cognition, motivation, and behavior can influence relations among writers, the environment, and writing achievement. We thus emphasize the effects of writing self‐efficacy beliefs on promoting active and efficient writing; in particular, learners need instruction on academic writing self‐ efficacy beliefs from a multidimensional perspective during the learning‐to‐write process. As Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) contended, enhancing students’ self‐efficacy beliefs can facilitate students’ management of cognitive aspects of writing and how they motivate themselves to work toward better writing outcomes when faced with obstacles or more appealing alternatives.

# 7 1 CONCLUSION

Overall, this study sought to validate the multidimensional features of an AWSEBQ. The CFA results lent support to the criterion validity of the proposed scale. The five factors of the AWSEBQ had predictive effects on EFL students’ academic writing performance. Overall, academic writing achievement in an EFL context is contingent upon learners’ perceptions of linguistic knowledge, self‐regulation, memory, writing performance, and information organization in academic writing.

Several limitations temper the findings. First, self‐efficacy beliefs are dynamic. The present study did not consider learners’ motivation. Second, interview data would have triangulated learners’ self‐reported data; a mixed‐method study would provide a more vivid picture of academic writing related to self‐efficacy beliefs. Third, future research should explore learners’ performance using a wider array of academic writing skills. Finally, the present study did not explore students’ language‐learning experiences or writing proficiency levels. As documented by F. Teng and Huang (2019), individual differences can influence student writers’ self‐ regulatory strategies in writing. Future research on learner variables and academic writing performance is therefore needed.

Despite these limitations, the present study provides valuable implications. In terms of theoretical implications, this study shows the promise of exploring the multidimensional features of self‐efficacy beliefs in EFL academic writing contexts. Synthesizing self‐efficacy beliefs with social cognitive theory can provide important insight into EFL student writers’ characteristics from psychological, linguistic, and behavioral perspectives. In terms of pedagogical implications, classroom practitioners can develop writing strategies to help learners identify, challenge, or modify less confident behaviors. For example, teachers could organize workshops to promote learners’ accurate judgment of their academic writing competence. Regarding writing assessment, teachers can gain information to diagnostically assess EFL learners’ self‐efficacy in academic writing. Overall, this study is innovative in exploring self‐efficacy beliefs in academic writing settings in a foreign language context.

# APPENDIX B: ACADEMIC WRITING SELF‐EFFICACY BELIEF QUESTIONNAIRE (AWSEBQ)

Directions: Thank you very much for taking part in this survey about writing strategies. This is not a test, so there are no “right” or “wrong” answers, only personal opinions that we value. Please give your answers sincerely as only this will guarantee the success of the investigation. Thank you for your cooperation. Following are a number of statements with which some people agree and others disagree. Please indicate your own opinion after each statement by circling the number that best describes the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement.

$1 =$ strongly disagree, $2 =$ disagree, $3 =$ slightly disagree, $4 =$ neutral, $5 =$ slightly agree, $6 =$ agree, $7 =$ strongly agree

For example, if you “strongly agree” that “I like English writing,” please circle “7”:
