The communicative purpose of oral academic genres is frequently achieved through multimodal ensembles (i.e., a combination of meaning-making resources or modes). This is the case in research pitches. However, little has been written about this genre and its multimodal nature. Drawing from previous research on multimodality (Jewitt, 2009; Norris, 2009; Valeiras Jurado, 2019), I examine traces of modal density, complexity and cohesion in research pitches’ opening and closing moves, which often reflect researchers need to persuade their audience of the importance of their research. The aim of this study is twofold. First, I analyse the rhetorical structure of six well-rated 3-min research pitches following Swales’ move theory (2004). Second, adopting a Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA) perspective (Querol-Julian, 2011; Valeiras-Jurado  & Ruiz-Madrid, 2019), I describe how the multimodal ensembles orchestrated by the speakers contributed to the communicative aim of the opening and closing moves. By way of conclusion, I derive pedagogical implications from the findings of this study.

# 1. Introduction

It can be argued that strong oral academic communication skills constitute a vital asset for both early-career and established scholars (Aguilar, 2004; Hu & Liu, 2018; Shaikh-Lesko, 2014; Valeiras-Jurado, 2019). Research pitches (RPs) are probably one of the most recently developed oral genres in the academic field. They are very similar to 3-Minute Thesis (3 MT) presentations. In fact, both are presentations which usually challenge researchers to report their research in a limited time to an audience from a range of disciplines and following strict competition rules, for example, a limited number of static Powerpoint (PPT) slides. However, RPs present not only thesis research but also any other type of study the presenters may be participating in (e.g., projects). Furthermore, while 3 MT presentations typically involve young novice researchers, in RPs, the age or experience of the researchers is not taken into consideration.

Research pitches can benefit from the numerous studies that discuss good practices about pitching in the business field (Coughter, 2016; Rutger et al., 2017, pp. 37e73). Indeed, there are many articles and guides to pitching in this particular field that advise practitioners on how to design and deliver an effective pitch (see Valeiras-Jurado, Ruiz-Madrid & Jacobs, 2018). Yet, the specific features of RPs need to be explored in order to fully understand the genre beyond the linguistic features. Given its increasing importance within academia, a comprehensive and accurate description of this genre is essential for pedagogical purposes, such as preparing PhD students and researchers to exploit its full multimodal communicative potential. To date, the literature about pitches in general has adopted a very practical stance. Priority has been given to goals such as identifying certain features that make them (un)successful rather than characterizing these oral presentations as a genre. Of the few studies that did focus on academic pitches (Chang & Huang, 2015; Hu & Liu, 2018) none approached the genre from a multimodal discourse analysis perspective.

This study has two main objectives. First, it sets out to analyse the rhetorical structure of research pitches to provide a comprehensive context for a microanalysis of the opening and closing moves. Second, by adopting a multimodal approach, it explores how the multimodal ensembles orchestrated by speakers contribute to the communicative aims of the opening and closing moves in successful RPs in English and, therefore, to help researchers better prepare their pitches. The main hypothesis in this study is grounded in previous research on multimodality (Jewitt, 2009; Norris, 2009) that demonstrates the communicative effect of the multimodal ensemble. Informed by this research, I argue that the effectiveness of research pitches e as intensive short communicative events e can be better understood by analysing the modal density and complexity of very cohesive modal ensembles of their moves, rather than by only exploring the individual contribution of each mode (Chang & Huang 2015; Hu & Liu, 2018). This is especially true in the initial and final parts of pitches, where speakers might need to emphasise their take-home message. In order to verify this proposal empirically, I first conduct a critical review of previous research on the Multimodal Discourse Analysis (henceforth MDA) approach to oral academic discourse in general and research pitches in particular. I then explain the case study methodology employed and outline the organisational structure, linguistic exponents and rhetorical features of a successful research pitch. Finally, I look into the multimodal nature of one opening and one closing move by analysing their modal density. I explore, in particular, the way modes interrelate (Norris, 2004) and their modal coherence, that is, consistency in the use of these modes (Valeiras-Jurado, 2019). My aim is to understand how multimodality contributes to the communicative aim of these particular moves and eventually to identify their multimodal ensembles (Kress, 2010). These multimodal ensembles are understood as whole constructs whose nature and function result from the interaction of all modes. This type of study is in line with previous studies in the field of MDA such as Crawford-Camiciottoli and Campoy-Cubillo (2018), Querol-Julian and Fortanet-Gomez  (2014), Valeiras- Jurado (2019), and Ruiz Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2019  .

# 2. Multimodality and oral academic genres

Previous multimodal studies on conference presentations (CPs) (Crawford-Camiciottoli, 2015; Fortanet-Gomez  & RuizMadrid, 2014; Hood & Forey, 2005; Morell, 2015; Querol-Julian, 2011 ; Rendle-Short, 2006; Valeiras-Jurado, 2015), lectures (Ruiz-Madrid and Fortanet-Gomez, 2015  ) and dissemination talks (Valeiras- Jurado et al., 2018) have revealed that speakers fulfil their communicative aims through a skilfully orchestrated use of linguistic, paralinguistic and kinesic means. For the purpose of the present study I will follow Poyatos’ definition of paralanguage and kinesics. Paralanguage is considered as “a series of vocal/narial voice modifications and independent sounds and meaningful silences” (Poyatos 1983, p. 139). Kinesics, on the other hand, is defined as:

The systematic study of psychomuscularly-based body movements (gestures and manners) and/or their resulting positions (postures), either learned or somatogenic, of visual, visual-acoustic and tactile or kinesthetic perception, that, whether isolated or combined with the linguistic-paralinguistic structures and with the situational context, possess communicative value, either in a conscious way or out of awareness (Poyatos, 1983, p. 139).

The selection of these particular modes is based on their virtually unavoidable presence in oral speech and on their important contribution to the communicative purpose of research pitches. Indeed, they are what “truly gives the spoken words their total meaning” (Poyatos, 1983, p. 129).

Previous studies of conference presentations have already analysed how speakers often use kinesic and paralinguistic resources as signposts to walk the audience through their presentations. In this sense, paralinguistic and kinesic resources help speakers to mark the macrostructure of their discourse (Rendle-Short, 2006), compensate for verbal deficiencies or convey specific meanings (Morell, 2015). Concerning the role of kinesics and paralanguage in conveying interpersonal meaning, Hood and Forey (2005) observed how plenary speakers used gestures to subtly evaluate their presentations in positive terms and encouraged alignment between audience and presenter. Querol Julian (2011)  also focused on the role of paralanguage and kinesics in meaning-making during Q&A sessions. She concluded that these multimodal features play an important pragmatic and modal role in such sessions in CPs. Valeiras-Jurado et al. (2018) showed how speakers orchestrated different semiotic modes into multimodal ensembles to make their dissemination talks more persuasive. Indeed, a significant relation between a skilful integrated use of modes and effective oral persuasive communication was found for this particular genre.

Finally, previous research that adopted MDA approaches to oral academic discourse (Querol-Julian, 2011 ; Ruiz-Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2015  ; Valeiras-Jurado & Ruiz-Madrid, 2019; Valeiras-Jurado & Morell, 2020) showed the contribution that multimodal features can make to defining oral academic genres such as research pitches. Yet, MDA approaches must be comprehensive and systematic enough to provide an effective framework for analysis.

# 2.1. A multimodal discourse analysis approach to research pitches

Research pitches can be considered an emerging genre, and as such they are still not thoroughly studied. An MDA approach to research pitches can shed light on different, still unexplored aspects, such as the rhetorical features and moves of the genre, the way moves are realized by means of multimodal ensembles, and those features that may require special pedagogical attention. Therefore, a comprehensive MDA approach to research pitches should include:

a) a rhetorical dimension to find and define recurrent moves and explore differences across disciplines;   
b) a multimodal dimension to apply a method of analysis in which language, visual communication and gestures are jointly analysed;   
c) a pedagogical dimension to design informed pedagogical proposals that help researchers and PhD students effectively prepare their research pitches.

This section briefly discusses each of the three dimensions and their relevance in the characterization of the RP from an MDA perspective. Finally, the research questions that guide this study are formulated.

Concerning the rhetorical dimension, Chang and Huang (2015) focused on 3MT presentations, which challenge students to report their dissertation (degree, master or PhD) to a disciplinarily heterogeneous audience in just 3 min following specific competition rules (e.g., the use of a limited number of PPT slides). These authors showed that 3MT presentations are conceived as an exercise in pitching and therefore as a type of dramatic monologue performance, which seeks an emotional and intellectual impact by emphasizing the vocal and physical performances to connect with the audience. They also showed that the planning of the presentation space and constraints can contribute to obtaining the best effect. Hu and Liu (2018) examined the rhetorical structure of 3MT presentations based on Swales’ definition of genre (1990). They analysed a corpus of 142 presentations by PhD students from different disciplines. The analysis identified eight distinct discoursal segments performing particular communicative functions (Swales, 2004) in the 3 MT presentations, including six obligatory moves (i.e. Orientation, Rationale, Purpose, Methods, Implication and Termination) and two optional ones (i.e. Framework and Results). Hu and Liu’s (2018) findings have important pedagogical implications for the design of courses on spoken academic discourse in general, and 3MT presentations in particular, since they allow for a systematic approach to the genre and its teachability in academic English courses.

Regarding the multimodal dimension, Valeiras-Jurado et al. (2018) examined the use of persuasive language in dissemination talks from an MDA perspective. The study focused on how different semiotic modes contribute to the persuasive effect of discourse in this particular genre in which scientists from different fields disseminate their activity to a lay audience (e.g., TED talks). The MDA of multimodal ensembles in this study revealed the prominent role that persuasion plays in dissemination talks and suggested that larger scale studies might bring to the fore recurrent multimodal patterns contributing to the communicative aim of this genre. The multimodal nature of pitches as a genre and its teachability have also been explored in the business field. In this respect, Cestero-Mancera (2018) and Valeiras-Jurado (2019, 2020) explored the role of intonation and gestures in the effective construction of persuasion in product pitches for business. Results from their studies suggested that persuasive communication in product pitches is highly dependent on the orchestration of the multimodal ensembles. They also highlighted the need for specific training in multimodal awareness to effectively construct persuasive messages in business settings.

As for the pedagogical dimension, a few studies have focused on the teachability of multimodal competence as part of oral academic genre awareness (Beltran-Palanques and Querol-Julian, 2018; Morell, 2015; Ruiz Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2019  ; Ruiz-Madrid & Valeiras-Jurado, 2020; Tamarit & Skorczynska, 2014). These studies concluded that being aware of the affordances of the semiotic modes and their combinations can lead to a more comprehensive genre-awareness and eventually to an improved communicative event.

The purpose of this study is, therefore, to show how an MDA approach can contribute to a deeper understanding of the rhetorical structure of the research pitch. In order to do so, I focus on the analysis of two examples in research pitches: one of an opening move and one of a closing move. The selection of these moves is motivated by their multimodal nature. In fact, these two moves are expected to be particularly modally dense, since they include instances of speakers calling the audience’s attention and emphasizing their take-home message. The research questions guiding the multimodal analysis are the following:

(i) What is the nature of the multimodal ensembles employed by speakers in the opening and closing moves of their research pitches? (ii) What is the function of these multimodal ensembles in the rhetorical structure of research pitches?

The study reveals the multimodal affordances drawn upon by researchers when attempting to attract their audience’s attention either at the beginning or at the end of their pitches. Consequently, it may help researchers understand which semiotic resources can be exploited when they try to persuade their audience about the potential of their research and eventually make them master the generic nature of these particular moves.

# 3. Corpus and method

Multimodal ensembles refer to the orchestration of different modes to produce a specific meaning that is inferred based on the interrelation among the specific modes involved. The communicator orchestrates multimodal ensembles, where each mode has a function (Kress, 2010) and “each mode is partial in relation to the whole meaning” (Jewitt & Kress, 2003, p. 3). In order to explore the nature of the multimodal ensembles employed by speakers in the opening and closing moves of their research pitches, I follow a multimodal analysis approach. A more detailed account of this methodology can be found in section 3.3.

# 3.1. Data collection

The corpus for this study consists of six research pitches selected from two contests organised in Universitat Jaume I in Spain in 2016 and 2017. This local event was the first stage of an international research pitch contest organised by the international Compostela Group of Universities. Participants must follow certain guidelines for if their research pitches were to be entered into the contests: i) only one speaker per pitch is allowed; ii) each participant has 3 min to present their research in English; iii) up to three static slides are allowed as supporting material; iv) pitches must be videorecorded and may be edited; and v) they should include presenters’ university logos. These strict guidelines mean that research pitches are prepared in advance rather than presented spontaneously. However, I do not consider lack of spontaneity as a weakness of my study but as an inherent variable I should take into account in the interpretation of results. From an MDA perspective, the nature of modes (gestures, visuals, speech) - being more or less spontaneous - could affect the modal coherence of the multimodal ensemble but would not affect its nature. Therefore, spontaneity could affect the communicative effectiveness but would not affect the composition of the multimodal ensemble.

# 3.2. The corpus

Six research pitches out of the 32 submitted to the contests were selected based on their final classification (i.e. first, second and third positions). The total size of the corpus is $1 7 \mathrm { m } 1 7 s$ , which does not allow for quantitatively based generalisations but is valid for qualitative analyses, considering the duration of the pitches analysed (i.e., no longer than $3 \mathrm { m }$ ). The corpus size is similar to those adopted in previous multimodal studies (Morell, 2015; Querol-Julian, 2011; Valeiras-Jurado & Ruiz-Madrid, 2019), which could not afford to use larger corpora due to their minute level of data analysis and the lack of automating tools.

Consent was obtained from the six speakers, five of whom were female and one male. All of them were non-native speakers with high proficiency in English (i.e., C1 and C2 levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages), as self-reported in the consent forms they supplied, and had previous experience of presenting at conferences. Table 1 provides an overview of the corpus. The corpus was varied in terms of disciplines: two speakers from Linguistics, two speakers from Law, one speaker from Medicine, and one speaker from Psychology.

For the present study, the corpus was used with a twofold purpose: i) the six RPs were analysed to determine the rhetorical macrostructure (moves) of the genre; and ii) Move 2 and Move 5 of the six RPs (i.e., a total of 12 moves) were further analysed to look into their multimodal microstructure. The selection of these two particular moves was made on the basis of their communicative aim and their multimodal nature. Both moves have a similar persuasive communicative aim: Move 2 has the function of calling the audience’s attention, and the communicative aim of Move 5 is to provide the take-home message. Furthermore, both moves are expected to be modally dense because of their persuasive communicative aim. The size of this subcorpus of 12 moves (i.e., 6 instances of M2 and 6 instances of M5) amounted to $3 \mathrm { m } 5 7 s$ , which made it modest but valid for qualitative analysis (see section 3.2). To keep track of the moves while preserving the anonymity of speakers, they were labelled according to the move (M2/M5) and the number of the research pitch (e.g., M2RP1). Appendix 1 provides further details of the 12 moves analysed.

Table 1 Description of the corpus.

Once the MDA of the 12 moves had been conducted, the next step was to select two examples, one of Move 2 (M2RP1) and one of Move 5 (M5RP2), to describe the multimodal ensembles found and show how the semiotic modes contributed to the communicative aim of each particular move. The selection of these two particular samples was based on the quality of the RPs (RP1 and RP2 winning the first and the second position in the research pitches contest) and the speakers’ profile (both speakers having similar English proficiency and expertise). M2RP1 and M5RP2 were divided into smaller chunks for finegrained analysis. The identification, delimitation and selection of these chunks were carried out using an inductive approach to video data (Goldman et al., 2007). This process involved viewing all of the video data repeatedly and analysing the data in increasing depth in order to identify and describe themes, key moments of importance and the structure of the event (Jewitt, 2009).

# 3.3. Method and materials

The analysis of the rhetorical macrostructure of the genre was based on a previous pilot study (Ruiz-Madrid & FortanetGomez, 2016  ), which revealed connections between a research pitch and other spoken academic genres such as 3 MT (Chang & Huang, 2015; Copeman, 2015; Hu & Liu, 2018), dissemination talks (Valeiras-Jurado et al., 2018) and product pitches in the field of business (Cestero-Mencera, 2018; Valeiras-Jurado, 2019). The structure of the six RPs was also analysed in line with Swales’ move analysis (Swales, 2004). Furthermore, to ensure interrater reliability, these results were first compared to those obtained in the previous pilot study (Ruiz-Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2016  )) and then discussed with two researchers until a consensus was reached on the rhetorical structure. Although the results concerning the rhetorical structure of research pitches cannot be generalised, as only 6 RPs were analysed, the comparison with other genres and the good interrater reliability afforded a tentative rhetorical structure that could be considered as a starting point for further research on research pitches as a genre.

The multimodal analysis of the moves followed those conducted in previous studies on MDA (Querol-Julian, 2011 ; Ruiz Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2019  ; Valeiras-Jurado &. Ruiz-Madrid, 2019), and the following modes were distinguished:

a) words, mainly those used as stylistic strategies and metadiscourse (Fuertes-Olivera, 2001; Hyland, 2005);   
b) four types of kinesics: gesture, head movement, facial expression (Kendon, 2004), gaze (Argyle et al., 1981) as well as the way they interact with speech (Ladewig, 2013; Müller, 2013);   
c) paralanguage as well as the functions it accomplishes in the discourse (Brazil, 1997; Poyatos, 2002);   
d) the visual material used by the speakers.

A computer-aided multimodal analysis of the selected moves was conducted with the software ELAN1 (Brugman & Russel, 2004). This linguistic annotation tool (EUDICO Linguistic Annotator) makes it possible to transcribe and annotate audio and video files and to organise transcriptions and annotations in different tiers. For the multimodal analysis the tier structure shown in Fig. 1 was used:

The “Transcription” tier included the orthographic transcription. The “Moves” tier contained annotations about the different moves in the RP. The “Paralanguage” tier included the analysis of intonation. The “Words” tier included the rhetorical function of significant words. Gestures were analysed in two different tiers to capture their type (i.e. “Gesture 1”) and function (i.e. “Gesture 2”). Gaze and facial expressions were also analysed in different tiers (i.e., the “Gaze” tier and the “Facial expression” tier) (see (Valeiras-Jurado and Ruiz-Madrid, 2019) for a more detailed description of this classification system). The researcher’s initial analysis of the gestures was further discussed with two experienced researchers in MDA in order to ensure its validity. Most disagreements concerned the functions of the gestures. Consensus was reached by taking into account not only a gesture’s surrounding or co-occurring words but also its role within the whole multimodal ensemble. In addition, it was acknowledged that modes can frequently have several functions at the same time and that the boundaries are never clear cut.

# 4. Results

In this section I first present the rhetorical macrostructure of the RP. Next, I analyse the microstructure of two moves. Finally, I describe how the different semiotic modes were combined in multimodal ensembles to achieve the communicative aim of each move analysed.

# 4.1. Description of the macrostructure of the research pitches

As the analysis shows, the macrostructure of the research pitches studied can be represented as follows (Fig. 2):

![](img/d1233f51ca8d5d49f07d88a150d27c7bfa9359e7ca64adbf7405421b7143d529.jpg)

The first move e the introduction e allows speakers to introduce themselves and contextualise the communicative interaction by giving their name, affiliation and some brief information about the time and topic of their RP. The following example from RP6 illustrates Move 1: Hello, my name is (…). I work for the Department of Medicine at the (removed for review purposes) and I have 3 min to explain [to] you what we are working on (…). However, Move 1 should be considered an optional move, since only two (i.e. RP2 and RP6) out of the six speakers introduced themselves.

In Move 2, speakers have to draw the audience’s attention to the problem or situation they are referring to. In order to do that, they can use different discursive strategies and structures. Examples of such ploys include the use of second person singular ‘you’ to address the audience in a direct way (e.g., Imagine you are in a bar, having a beer with a close friend, when suddenly the news on TV attracts your attention [RP1]), asking a direct question (e.g., how many times have you heard these questions? [RP5]) or combining narrative and keywords (e.g., ‘mental illness’ and ‘depression’ [RP3]).

Move 3 (review of previous research) provides speakers with the opportunity to contextualise their work by referring to previous literature. Speakers also justify the need for their research in order to fill the existing gap. In Move 3 of RP6, for example, the speaker provided a brief explanation of what triggers the death of cells and what has been done so far in order to contextualise the gap to be filled. After that, she resorted to a direct and simple question (i.e., ‘How do we do that?’) to advance to the next move (i.e., Move 4: explaining the research). Another example from RP5 also illustrates the structure of Move 3. In this case, the speaker provided the audience with information on the specific context of tax laws and how they work in Spain. In order to point out the gap, she used a negative utterance: ‘That’s not new’. The anaphoric function of the pronoun ‘that’, which refers to all the previous measures taken in the field of tax systems, is especially remarkable. It enabled the speaker to emphasise the need for innovative measures like the ones her research group proposed, which were then elaborated in Move 4.

Move 4 (Explaining the research: the benefits and advances that it will provide to solve the previously described problem or situation) allows speakers to outline their specific research and the benefits it will bring to their field. This can be clearly seen in RP4, in which the speaker introduced the benefit of his research with a clear statement: Initial results show how nonverbal communication is essential and vital to create an appropriate connection with the audience and pass on all the knowledge and meaning.

Move 5 (Closing) includes two steps. While step 1 (i.e., take-home message) was present in all the RPs analysed, step 2 (i.e., final leave-taking) could be categorised as optional, since it was explicitly verbalised with ‘thank you’ in only three of the RPs. In this last move, the speakers attempted to attract the audience’s attention by using different exhortative linguistic structures to finish their RPs such as direct questions (e.g., Do you want to solve it? [RP5]; Have you ever been a victim of corruption? [RP1]) or exclamatory sentences (e.g., Think about it! [RP4]). Other structures were also used, such as in RP2, where the speaker closed her pitch by suggesting that the audience should take action (i.e., Let’s help them acquire the academic achievement they all deserve). In the case of RP2, RP3 and RP6, the speakers used a short affirmative sentence ‘thank you’ to finish their speech and moved on to take leave.

The results presented above provide insights into the rhetorical macrostructure of RPs. In particular, they contextualise the rhetorical functions of opening (i.e. M2) and closing (i.e. M5) moves in the genre. However, a more detailed and comprehensive analysis is needed to fully understand how the communicative aim of each move is fulfilled. It is important to note that this process frequently implies the use of several modes. In addition, the interpretation of each mode can change depending on whether it is examined in isolation or within the context of the full modal ensemble. An MDA approach can reveal how modes may contribute to a joint communicative aim in ways that would go unnoticed if only one mode is analysed. The next section focuses on the MDA analysis of two particular samples.

# 4.2. MDA microanalysis: multimodal ensembles in M2RP1 and M5RP2

Moves 2 and 5 from the six analysed RPs were selected for MDA. These moves were chosen on the basis of their communicative aim. My hypothesis was that M2 (i.e., opening move) and M5 (i.e., closing move) would be modally dense, complex and coherent in order to be effective in persuading the presenters’ audiences of the importance of their research. The MDA would allow me to further explore the interrelationships among the modes (i.e., modal density) (Norris, 2004) and the consistency in the use of these modes (i.e., modal coherence) (Valeiras -Jurado, 2019) in each of the examples selected.

As presented above, M2 and M5 have similar persuasive communicative aims. In the case of M2, speakers draw the audience’s attention to the problem or the situation that needs researching. In M5, speakers invite the audience to think further about the topic (i.e. the take-home message) and in some cases add a final leave-taking phrase.

Concerning M2 (i.e. calling the audience’s attention), the analysis showed that the average duration of this move was 28s and the speakers resorted to a rich and varied multimodal ensemble to convey their message. M2RP1 was the second move of RP1 from the field of Law and focused on corruption. Lasting 8s, it was the shortest of the M2s analysed. However, as expected, the multimodal ensemble had a high modal density and complexity and produced a very cohesive multimodal ensemble (see Fig. 3). The speaker in RP1 resorted mainly to gestures and paralanguage to attract the audience’s attention, while head movements and visuals were less relevant in this RP.

Fig. 4. Description of sequences in M2RP1.

Fig. 4 offers a detailed description of how the different modes articulate in the multimodal ensemble. The co-occurrence of the different semiotic modes in M2RP1 (i.e., linguistic, paralinguistic and kinesic features together with supporting elements) conveyed a coherent multimodal ensemble that enabled the speaker to draw the audience’s attention to the topic-to-come. In sequences 1 and 2 of this excerpt, the semiotic modes contributed to calling the audience’s attention and helped the speaker to create a relaxing atmosphere. Verbally, the speaker used the imperative imagine and the second person singular your attention to address the audience directly. She also resorted to words with positive connotations such as imagine, bar, beer and close friend to make the audience evoke nice relaxing moments. As for intonation, the speaker emphasised these keywords in the first sequence by stressing them and with a high pitch. Gaze was also reinforcing the presenter’s communicative aim, since she looked directly at the camera during the whole excerpt.

The speaker’s kinesics helped maintain the relaxing and friendly connection with the audience. The speaker employed a recurrent gesture (Ladewig, 2014) in sequence one (i.e., hand wide open with palm facing the audience) which was metaphoric in form and co-occurred with speech to serve two functions: i) a partly pragmatic function, since this gesture conveyed a positive attitude towards the situation the speaker was describing; ii) a partly interpersonal function by attempting to control the audience’s reactions (i.e., prompting them to picture in their minds the situation she is describing for them). In the second sequence, a similar metaphoric gesture but this time with both palms facing each other can be interpreted as referentially conveying the social closeness the speaker is describing. In the third sequence, the speaker introduced the main topic of her presentation and again resorted to different semiotic modes in order to seek the attention and arouse the curiosity of the audience. In this third sequence, the interrelation of language (e.g., suddenly, television, your attention), intonation and gestures became especially relevant. The adverb suddenly and the noun television helped the author to reconnect with the audience and make them pay attention to the new information sequence to come. Finally, the noun phrase your attention was a direct call to the audience’s focus of interest. Intonation was also higher in pitch when these words were pronounced, and simultaneously, the speaker again employed a recurrent gesture (i.e., both hands open with palms facing the audience). This was a metaphoric gesture in form with a pragmatic and an interpersonal function: making the audience pay attention to the disruptive event she was about to describe and making them perceive this disruption as negative. In addition, the speaker added a beat characteristic (i.e., repetitive) to this metaphoric gesture by moving her hands slightly up and down. In this case, the beats were coordinated with language (i.e., suddenly, television, your attention) in order to parse the narration and emphasise the pragmatic and the interpersonal function. The speaker’s gaze was intense, and her facial expression became serious when she was pronouncing the word suddenly. Furthermore, the three sequences were accompanied by a slide. This slide contained a word cloud in blue capital letters with the names of the police operations against corruption in recent years in Spain and the title of the RP “Who suffers [from] this corruption?” A caption of M2RP1 is shown in Fig. 5:

In sum, it can be seen that all the modes analysed cohered in a well-orchestrated multimodal ensemble that contributed to a common and clear communicative aim.

The second example focused on here is M5RP2. The RP was from the field of Linguistics and pivoted on the difficulties of EFL learning for dyslexic students. M5RP2 lasted 16s, longer than the average (i.e., 7s). It demonstrated a coherent multimodal ensemble in which different modes interacted in order to effectively convey the rhetorical function of this particular move (i.e., to make the take-home message clear for the audience), as shown in Fig. 6.

The speaker in RP2 resorted mainly to language, paralanguage, gestures and head movements to convey her final message, while gaze, facial expressions and visuals were only used in very specific moments of her speech in this excerpt (see Fig. 6). Fig. 7 presents a detailed description of how the different modes articulated in the multimodal ensemble.

As detailed in Fig. 7, the speaker drew the audience’s attention to the take-home message by employing linguistic, paralinguistic and kinesic features simultaneously. Linguistically, in both sequences 1 and 2 the speaker used a suggestion structure: Let’s with an inclusive pronoun us. This could be interpreted as an attempt to make the audience feel closer to her final message. The first sequence of this move (see Fig. 8) started with a suggestion: Let’s help dyslexic students complete the race without any hurdles. The speaker here employed the inclusive us, which was accompanied by a metaphoric, pragmatic gesture (raising her right shoulder up) and a head movement (leaning her head towards the shoulder when pronouncing let’s). This modal combination can be interpreted as an invitation for the audience to empathise with the speaker and become part of the solution she was about to propose. The suggestion was followed by positive words such as complete the race and two negative words (i.e., without and hurdle) that, when collocated together and with the help of intonation and gestures, transmitted a positive connotation. Intonation played a fundamental role, exemplified by the speaker’s use of a high-pitched intonation when she introduced the key words dyslexic students. As for gestures, an iconic, referential gesture (i.e., a long slow flat hand movement with palm down from right to left) when pronouncing complete the race helped the audience to imagine the race trajectory. Moreover, a metaphoric, pragmatic gesture (i.e., a fast flat hand movement with palm down from left to right) helped the speaker to reinforce the meaning of the positive concept without any hurdles. The speaker’s facial expression was serious with her gaze fixed on the audience, as if it could help her get the message across. No slide accompanied this last move, but there were some animated words in the final second saying thank you.

Fig. 6. Representation of M5RP2 multimodal ensemble.

The second sequence of M5RP2 (see Fig. 9) aimed at drawing the audience’s attention to the final message of the RP. As in the previous sequence, the speaker used the pragmatic structure of Let’s and the inclusive pronoun we to make a suggestion to the audience, making them active participants and bringing them emotionally closer to her. The speaker also employed words with positive connotations such as acquire, achievement and deserve to transmit positivity to the audience. She referred to dyslexic students in this sequence by using the third personal pronoun they, accompanied by an inclusive all, to endow her message with an inclusive perspective. These linguistic features were accompanied by paralinguistic and kinesic elements. For example, the speaker maintained a serious facial expression throughout the whole move as well as an intense gaze fixed on the camera that was intended to intensify the persuasive effect of the final message. Concerning gestures and head movements, she nodded in a beating movement (one nod per word) when pronouncing let’s help them acquire, thereby emphasizing the final message through a patterned rhythm. A beating hand also accompanied the academic achievement in an attempt to emphasise the need to address the disadvantageous situation of dyslexic students. Finally, when the speaker thanked the audience and the animated words appeared on the screen, she smiled and employed a recurrent gesture taking a deictic form (i.e., hand up and finger pointing at the audience) but serving a clear interpersonal function to appeal to the audience in a very direct way and invite them to become actively involved in the topic (i.e., a call to action).

# 5. Discussion: RP as a multimodal genre

The purpose of this research is twofold: to identify the rhetorical structure of research pitches following Swales’ move analysis (2004) and to examine, through an MDA analysis, how multimodal ensembles would contribute to the communicative aim of two specific moves in RPs: M2 and M5.

Concerning the first objective, the analysis of the macrostructure revealed that only two of the six speakers made an initial greeting or introduced themselves (i.e., Move 1). They usually started by drawing the audience’s attention to the problem or situation under investigation (i.e., Move 2) and then went on to refer to previous research or contexts (i.e., Move 3), explained their research and its benefits or advances for their particular field (i.e., Move 4), and placed special emphasis on their takehome message. They did not always use a final leave-taking device as a closing move (i.e. Move 5). It is relevant to mention here that in the editing guidelines speakers are instructed to open their videos with a first slide in which the title of the RP and the speakers’ name and affiliation are compulsory contents. Therefore, speakers might consider it redundant to introduce themselves or the title of the RP and may prefer to save their time for more important content. Similarly, step 1.2 (i.e., final leave-taking) in Move 5 was not present in all the RPs. The speakers seemed to prefer closing their speeches with an effective take-home message and including the leave-taking in the final slide of their presentation. The analysis revealed a tendency in the use of persuasive language in M2 and M5, as seen in M2RP1 and M5RP2, where speakers employed linguistic features such as you, direct questions and exclamatory sentences. In these moves, the speakers needed to attract the audience’s attention to the problem/situation they were referring to and to convince the audience that their research was necessary and valuable. The use of these specific linguistic features seemed to help them make their message more persuasive (ValeirasJurado et al., 2018; Valeiras-Jurado & Ruiz-Madrid, 2020), as attested to by the fact that the two RPs were highly ranked in the contest.

As for the second objective, the microanalysis of M2RP1 (i.e., example 1) and M5RP2 (i.e., example 2) showed that the two moves shared strong similarities in terms of modal density (Norris, 2004) and modal coherence (Valeiras-Jurado, 2019). These results suggested that multimodal ensembles in M2 and M5 played a crucial role in their communicative aim and were far more complex rhetorical constructs than mere signposts guiding the speaker through the discourse (Halliday, 1994). Accordingly, and as shown in Figs. 3 and 6, language, gestures and paralanguage were the most relevant modes in these specific moves because they consistently contributed to the effective achievement of the communicative aim in question.

Fig. 9. Sequence 2 from M5RP2.

Concerning language, the analyses of both examples (i.e., M2RP1 and M5RP2) showed that the speakers attempted to construct an engaging and affective relationship with their audience by using concepts or words (Perloff, 2003) that carried some sort of emotional semantic content (M2RP1: friend, bar, beer; M5RP2: help, acquire, achievement). Both speakers made use of inclusive pronouns (i.e., we, us) that helped them guide the listener towards a perceived relevance of the reported research and contributed to the construction of a common ground and rapport with the audience (Hyland, 2010). The speakers also resorted to specific grammatical structures, such as a suggestion speech act (e.g., Let’s help dyslexic students complete the race without any hurdles and Let’s help them acquire the academic achievement they all deserve) to engage the audience and prompt a particular response.

Both speakers used head movements and gestures to enrich the meaning of their message. According to McClave (2000), head movements, in particular nods, could achieve interactive functions and serve as back-channelling requests. In M5RP2 the speaker accompanied the final message let’s help them acquire (…) with nods to seek the audience’s approval. In line with previous studies (Bavelas et al., 1995; Hood & Forey, 2005), the analyses of both excerpts revealed that gestures, especially those involving hand movements, were constantly present in the two moves to encourage alignment between the presenters and their audience. For instance, in M2RP1, the speaker employed a metaphoric interpersonal gesture (i.e., hand wide open with palm facing the audience) inviting the audience to imagine the bar experience with her imagine you’re in a bar. The speaker of RP2 used a deictic gesture (i.e., hand up and finger pointing at the audience) to build rapport, a finding in line with Heller’s (2010) previous results. Beats (Kendon, 2004) were also employed by both speakers. The first speaker employed them in combination with hand movements and intonations when she wanted to draw the audience’s attention, while saying when suddenly the news on television calls your attention. The second speaker used them in the final part of the move to highlight the keywords of her topic, that is, the academic achievement. In both cases, and as proposed by previous research (Querol-Julian, 2011), the beats functioned to guide the understanding of the message and highlight key elements. In the second case (i.e., highlighting of the academic achievement), the speaker was also able to build rapport with the audience and, as Bavelas et al. (1995) pointed out, transmit the idea of “as you already know”, since she needed to effectively deliver her take-home message with this closing. As for paralinguistic features, intonation was used by both speakers to project their intentions and assumptions (Brazil, 1997). Thus, intonation and hand movements helped emphasise key words in both RPs (M2RP1: bar, friend, suddenly; M5RP2: acquire, they all). These paralinguistic features appeared to serve a topic-focusing function for the speakers and therefore enhance the effect of their message on the audience (Bull & Conelly, 1985). This combined use of modes is a good example of how the communicative aim of this genre can be fulfilled by the multimodal ensemble as a whole rather than modes in isolation and highlights the added value of MDA: it brings to the fore complex meaning-making processes that would otherwise go largely unnoticed. For example, a gesture of palms facing up would not be interpreted as a call for action in itself, but it can achieve that purpose when combined with a gaze directed at the audience and the use of a high-pitched pronoun you.

Regarding the less dense modes in the examples analysed (i.e., facial expression, gaze and visuals), it must be said that despite their relatively low relevance in the multimodal ensembles, they should still be taken into consideration for a comprehensive understanding of the genre. Facial expression might also play a role when combined with the rest of the modes to achieve communicative functions (Wrembel, 2007) because in both examples, the speakers showed a serious facial expression when they wanted to draw the audience’s attention to a relevant message (see Figs. 4 and 7). Gaze is another mode that might be considered in combination with the other semiotic modes. In other genres such as public speeches, speakers interactively elicit applause from their audiences through gaze shifts (Atkinson, 1984), and consequently gaze can help to achieve communicative aims. In contrast, in the case of RPs, the monologic nature of the genre, the fact that the audience is not physically present, and the contextual videorecording conditions leave gaze with a limited functional role, namely, that of an intense gaze fixed on the camera (see Figs. 4 and 7). Likewise, and despite the fact that visuals are considered a major resource for meaning-making in presentations (Morell, 2015; Rowley-Jolivet, 2002), the role of visuals was also limited in the RPs. This reduced communicative contribution to the whole multimodal ensembles in this particular study was probably due to the restrictions of the contest, which explicitly limited the use of visuals to three slides. However, in both examples analysed, the visuals contributed, through images, figures and words, to the understanding of the message and may therefore be considered an effective supporting mode in RPs.

# 6. Conclusion

This study has shown that genre analysis can be viewed from a wider perspective that encompasses both the analysis of the rhetorical structure of a genre and the analysis of different multimodal ensembles. As reported, adopting an MDA approach to a particular genre serves to explore data from a different perspective, that is, going beyond the traditional Swales’ move model where language is the only mode examined, and to understand how multimodal ensembles contribute to the communicative aims of moves. Indeed, using two examples of moves, this exploratory study has demonstrated how multimodal ensembles effectively achieved their communicative aim (i.e., to draw audience’s attention).

The outcomes of the multimodal analysis of M2RP1 and M5RP2 have shown that the speakers made use of multiple semiotic modes to construct and shape their communicative aim in these particular opening and closing moves (i.e., drawing the audience’s attention). Both moves present strong similarities in terms of modal density and coherence of multimodal ensembles. In both moves, gestures and paralanguage were the most relevant modes employed by the speakers as they attempted to create rapport with the audience. Concerning gestures, it can be concluded that hand movements were the most recurrent, especially in those moments when the speakers attempted to encourage alignment between the audience and themselves. Head movements, in particular nods, were also frequent in both moves. The speakers employed them as interactive discursive elements that functioned as back-channelling requests. As for paralinguistic features, it was found that intonation was used by both speakers to narrow down the topic and make it relevant to the audience, especially in combination with hand movements and language. The MDA analyses of both moves also uncovered a lower relevance of facial expressions, gaze and visuals in the multimodal ensembles in terms of modal density, though the examples did show how these modes contributed to the communicative aim of drawing the audience’s attention in very specific moments in combination with other modes. Therefore, and despite their lower relevance in these particular multimodal ensembles, I argue they should be considered for a comprehensive understanding of the opening and closing moves in RPs.

Some limitations of this exploratory study need to be pointed out. Concerning the first objective, the corpus of the study included only six RPs. Regarding the second aim, one example of M2 (i.e. M2RP1) and one example of M5 (M5RP2) were analysed in detail and their multimodal ensembles described. As discussed in section 3.2, the size of the corpus was in line with previous studies and was considered valid for qualitative analyses. However, future MDA research on RPs could draw on larger corpora and more moves to develop a fuller understanding of the genre. Furthermore, this study only looked at one side of the coin because it focused on the researcher’s perceptions and interpretations of the empirical data informed by previous research on pitches and the jury’s evaluation of the pitches. Future research should focus on the triangulation among i) the speakers’ interpretations of their own multimodal behaviour concerning their communicative intentions, ii) the audience’s interpretation, to check whether these communicative intentions were in fact conveyed and taken up by the audience, and iii) the researcher’s analysis of the multimodal nature of the communicative event to check whether it reflects the speakers’ intended communicative aim.

Although further research is needed to validate the MDA approach in genre analysis, there are grounds for positing that the analytical framework presented in this paper can contribute to identifying those specific multimodal generic traits of oral academic genres because it is flexible, easily adaptable and data-driven. This analytic approach is well equipped to explore the importance of the semiotic modes deployed in RPs, how they are interrelated and how they can contribute to the traditional move analysis approach to oral academic genres by shifting the focus away from words only.

This new perspective on genre analysis, however, requires revisiting both the approach adopted to examine the nature of moves in the rhetorical structure of oral academic genres (as argued in this study) and the teachability of research pitches in particular and oral academic presentations in general (Busa, 2010 ; Morell, 2015; Tamarit & Skorczynska, 2014; Ruiz Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2019  ). As EAP teachers, we need to help students develop multimodal communicative competence and multimodal literacy in genres that are widely used in their respective areas. Despite the limitations of this study, results suggest that the teaching of research pitches should place more emphasis on multimodal discourse competence because the success of oral academic genres such as RPs depends largely on a skilful orchestration of modes, in particular when speakers are not using their mocther tongue (Morell, 2015; Ruiz-Madrid & Valeiras-Jurado, 2020). In order to do so, we need to make multimodal analysis pedagogically affordable and applicable in the classroom. A multimodal corpus-based training proposal for EAP students and teachers should aim at developing an appropriate metalanguage, raising awareness and encouraging reflection on the balanced and coherent use of the different modes involved in oral academic communication. The tasks designed for EAP courses should include the learning of the multimodal communicative processes and semiotic resources used to transmit relevant disciplinary knowledge as one of their pedagogical goals. Multimodal discourse competence should be explicitly taught and taken into account in the design of assessment tasks, in light of the impact of multimodality on the communication process.

To this end, teachers can create materials from multimodal corpora such as the one analysed in this study and implement a methodology informed by the MDA approach followed in this study. For instance, teachers can design specific activities that make students/researchers aware of the most effective semiotic resources when they try to persuade their audience about the potential of their research. MDA-based EAP teaching materials might eventually make students, teachers and researchers identify and understand the multimodal ensembles that convey the generic nature of particular moves. This connection between MDA-informed research on RPs and their teachability might provide the ideal framework for the development of pedagogically effective courses on research pitches. The benefits would include a more realistic and therefore effective approach to multimodal competence applied to genre pedagogy, that is, “one that includes both speech and other modalities, including task effectiveness under simulation, to better match the real-life skills targeted by curricular design” (Jimenez-  Munoz, 2019, p. 83(\~ Jimenez-Mu noz, 2019\~ ), p.83).

To conclude, the study reported throughout these pages does not claim to be exhaustive but rather aims to pave the way for larger scale studies that can provide more qualitative and quantitative data. The results of such a study can help refine our understanding and teaching of oral genres in general and of research pitches in particular. The benefits would include a more authentic and effective pedagogical approach to the development of multimodal competence in key academic oral genres.
