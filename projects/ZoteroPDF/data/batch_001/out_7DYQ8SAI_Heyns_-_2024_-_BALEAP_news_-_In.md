# BALEAP news - Introduction to SIGs: Meet the EMI SIG, the English Medium Instruction SIG

# Background

The English medium instruction special interest group (EMI SIG) of BALEAP was established on 28 March 2024 upon the approval of the proposal submitted by Mustafa Akıncıoglu ˘ (Founding Convenor and Treasurer) to the BALEAP Executive Committee.

# Specialist area and rationale

The EMI SIG opts for Akıncıoglu's ˘ (2023) definition of EMI (adopting Macaro & Akıncıoglu, ˘ 2018) as the use of English, for example sole use, partial use and code switching, both by students and content teachers to learn/teach academic subjects other than English itself. This is within EMI settings regardless of their locale. In essence, this definition allows the fields of EAP and EMI to be seen in a symbiotic relation where they can both learn from each other and help each other's development regardless of whether they are in Anglophone or non-Anglophone contexts.

The EMI SIG essentially construes the concept of EMI in a continuum of, and symbiotic relation with, the concept of EAP. With this perspective, the EMI SIG aims to place a greater focus on the efficacy levels of academic subject learning in EMI academic programs. Thus, the EMI SIG primarily aims to help the development of the field of EMI, while ‘learning’ from the field of EMI. Furthermore, the EMI SIG sees more similarities than differences between Anglophone context university lecture rooms and their non-Anglophone context counterparts (see Akıncıoglu, ˘ 2023; Wingate, 2022). Therefore, the EMI SIG believes that the field of EAP has a lot to offer the development of EMI universities globally through for example, joint research and publication, joint academic events, interdisciplinary collaboration for effective teaching and learning in EMI settings and professional development for EMI content-teachers.

# Aims of the EMI SIG

The EMI SIG aims to offer BALEAP's EAP expertise and experience to the field of EMI higher education with a focus on interdis ciplinary teacher collaboration and enhancing the quality levels of students' academic content learning outcomes in those EMI programs. In so doing, the EMI SIG aims to present opportunities both for BALEAP members to gain higher levels of awareness of the concept of EMI HE, and for international universities to adopt the highest quality EAP expertise and quality standards into their EMI provision. We believe that, as the research indicates clearly, there is a significant gap in terms of effective interdisciplinary collaboration between EAP and academic subject departments.

The EMI SIG aims to organise one international event every year, as well as organising context specific events. With this aim, the EMI SIG has already initiated a growing network of country liaisons - 12 liaisons from 10 countries. The first year of the EMI SIG will focus on developing a network internationally and organising at least two regional events. In the coming years, the EMI SIG will aim to organise academic events to bring together both EAP and EMI teachers to lay the grounds for interdisciplinary research and/or collaboration.

# Membership

The EMI SIG encourages EMI academic-content teachers, other EMI university stakeholders (e.g., EMI program managers, course designers, policy makers) and those interested in working in EMI contexts to join the EMI SIG network. The SIG will soon have a website, social media accounts and a YouTube channel to promote SIG activities.
