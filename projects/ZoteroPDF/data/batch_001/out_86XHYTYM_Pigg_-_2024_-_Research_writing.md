Generative AI

Research approaches that emphasize embodied practice and value the idiosyncratic uptake of writing technologies should be central to how writing researchers process the early moment of generative AI's availability to public audiences. Based on a qualitative analysis of 35 publicly available videos depicting the use of ChatGPT and Bing, the study offers a framework of descriptive codes that identify practices early adopters enact when integrating these technologies into research writing processes. The research contributes three key categories of practice that describe research writers' interaction with generative AI across research design, writing research genres, and proofreading and editing: requesting, evaluating, and refining. This study is significant for providing an early descriptive analysis of the uptake of ChatGPT in research writing, while also identifying how disparate uses of generative AI technologies emerge from conflicting beliefs about writing, research, and invention. In particular, the study describes how experts in writing and research portray uses of and attitudes toward these technologies that often differ from students who are learning to research and write in their respective fields.

With ambient light providing a purple backdrop, a dark-haired Ph.D. student in computational biology and bioinformatics sat facing no les than five open reading and writing surfaces. Looking over her shoulder from behind, it was possibl to spy one tablet displaying reading material, a smaller tablet propped on the esk with ascreen full of aplication icons, a notebook full of handwritten notes along the desk's far right side, and two fullsized desktop computer screens housing multiple software interfaces. The desktop screen directly i front f the student and t the let of the workspace displayed ChatG intrface, whil the creon the right was open to a folder containing several files and a chat dialog box. As she narrated a short description of how generative Al had become important to her work, this learner toggled on the lft screen from ChatGPT to a text editor program displaying code. ChatGPT helped her "with coding errors," she explained, and shealso used t to find reearch on partcular topics" when writing for her degree (Video 35). Positioned for a peek into her study process we could observe a generative AI interface integrated into a complex assembly: one element in a workspace that supported bioinformatics learning.

Studying writing scenes like this one must be integral to making sense of how generative AI technologies are shaping writing practices. This stting is drawn from the final artifact in my recent sample f publicly available onine videos that depict early adopters of generative Al using ChatGPT for their research writing. Approaching generative AI as writing and rhetoric program administrators, teachers, and researchers, we should apply foundational theories to arrive at reasoned methods for responding to our day-to-day challenges with these tools. And, yet, we stillneed systematic research that accounts for how writing is enacted in lived experi. ence. In particular, writing research approaches that emphasize embodied practice should be central to how we process this early moment of generative Al's availabilit to public audiences (Hs & Witte 201; Clayson, 2018; Lockridge & Van Ittersum, 2020). The opening vignette is emblematic of why that is the case: approaches to writing research that emphasize embodied practice positin writing technologies in rich material settings, in interaction with users habits of mind and body, and in concert (and also in conflict) with writers goals and purposes. Early adopters of new technologie participate directly in the evolution of writing practice, whil also experiencing how access prior knowledge,atitudes, and values toward writing and technology become intertwined with everyday practices.

This article reports from a qualitative study that uses an embodied practice orientation to better understand the early uptake of generative Al for research writing. Based on a detailed analysis f 35 publicly available videos depicting the use of these technologies, the study offers a framework of descriptive codes that name and describe practices early adopters enact when integrating these technologies into research writing. The research identifies requesting, evaluating, and refining as three categories of practice that describe research writers interactions with generative AI across research design, writing research genres, and proofreading and editing research communication. Although the study contribute a descriptive framework, AI use for research writing does not emerge from this analysis as a coherent or stable phenomenon. Instead, the study suggests disparate, fragmented uses of generative AI technologies that engage complex and ofen conflicting beliefs about the relationship between writing, technology, research, and invention.

# Generative AI: toward reflexivity, curiosity, and a turn to practice

Melanie Shoffner, editor of English Education (2023), captured a natural cynicism many writing educators have experienced in response to the sudden public availabilit of generative Al technologies. As Shoffner put it, I activates my questioning reflex. ven the term gives me pause (p. 200). Shoffer's skeptical stance is warranted, especially given that generative AI development is being pushed forward by an information technology industry with a shaky track record when it comes to looking out for the best interests of users. As Laquintano et al. (2023) described, writing scholars and instructors have found ourselves poised to rethink and reinvent writing theory and practice while Big Tech rushes ahead in its AI arms race with the intention of having large language models (LMs) mediate most f our writte communicatin' (n.p.) Digital rhetoricians have earned our skepticism toward emerging technologies the hard way as a result of researching social media technologies as they have become more and more intertwined with data privacy breaches and survellnce logics (Tufecki, 2014), proliferating misiformation (Lewandowsky et al., 2017), and decreasing mental health outcomes (Twenge et al., 2018; Woods et al., 2016).

And yet as scholars such as Gonzales (2023) and Johnson (2023) have argued, a reflexive stance requires us to critically question not only technologies and their designers, but also our own skepticism toward them. After all complex technologies in higher edu. cation have en shuffling, ranking, and surveilling stdents for year. Gonzales argued that muchof the \*er and anger that faculty and administrators assgn to generative AI technologies can be traced to anxieties that aris from these technologies' newfound accesibility: that students now have the power of these tools in their hands (p. 214). Berdejo-Espinola and Amano (2023) took a similar stance when arguing for a more open-minded attitude toward the potential use of ChatGPT in scientific research writing. Responding to Science editor Holden Thorp's recent move to ban AI-generated writing from his authoritative journal (Thorp, 2023), Berdejo-Espinola and Amano argued that Al tools have the potential for \*allviating linguistic disparities" for scientific researchers Who are not native English speakers. By reducing the cost and time required for profreading and editing, for example, these tech. nologies may make achieving standard written English more atainable for those who have been systematically denied entry to scientific conversations.

Studying emerging writing technologies has always required writing and rhetoric scholars to wade in murky waters of this sort where we balance conflicting values and work through mes intersections. Pathways to increased access and participation often open up right alongside ifficult, negative consequences. As Graham (2023) reminded us, the history of writing has been a history of reactions and overreactions to new technologies, which has prepared digital rhetoricians to handle the complexity of atechnology like generative Al. Anson's (2022) analysi f potential intersections between generative AI and plagiarism offered a meaningful example. Anson argued that we should resist applying a default narrative of "detection and prevention to generative Al because these tools can function as important invention aids. Describing a hypothetical example of using ChatGPT to generate taglines for a writing center, Anson reflcted, 'these auto-generated examples might spark some new human generated ideas or perhaps one of them would be sufficient. . NLP systems can serve as invention prompts, or as text generators whose outputs are either revised or used verbatim" (g. 42).

Other early writing- and rhetoric-focused analyses of ChatGPT and generative AI have lead to similar reflections on how the technologies may impact our attitudes toward writte invention, through practices of developing and refining text and ideas. Vee (2023) pointed out that a downside of generative AlI is its projection of certainty, even in moments when it clearly is producing inaccuracies or hallucinating" as the phenomenon has become known. Ve argued that this projection of certainty runs counter to writing as a practice f inquiry, or writing as a process of positing, grappling, and discovering what we do not already know. Morrison (2023) made a similar point in contrasting her own reflections on the intersections between writing and generative AI with words generated by ChatGPT. Her own reflection playfully engaged uncertainty and performed the experience of coming to meaning while inhabiting a body with its own needs, demands, and constraints. While her reflection centered humanity and contingency, ChatGPT offered us "smooth confidence and competence, the soothing qualit of authoring that ozes from abstract nouns in sentence crafted in faultless Standard English."

It was this ability of generative AI and ChatGPT to generat text effortlessly performing authority and objectivity that intilly interested me in its intration in reech writig. Particlarly in scietific and social scientific rarch writing, scholars have argued that authority of writing often derives from its ability to highlight methodological innovations and precision of results in an objective voice, while downplaying human involvement in research or writing (Bazerman, 1988). Furthermore, the relationship betwen writing and the invention of meaning in a scientific research context is already complex. On the one hand, once writers have reached the stage of composing formal genres such as scientific research articles, many of the framing choices that shape the potential for meaning have been determined, such that there is ittle rom for maneuverability (Jack, 2018). On the other hand, writing in the context of scientific inquiry is not limited to formal genres (of which Swales [2004] reminded us there is much variation anyway); instead \*inscription' and the transformation of materials into language is at the heart of the scientific research enterprise (Latour & Woolgar, 1979). We need to understand how researchers are reconciling the availability of this most unusual ool with the multiple complex opportunities for writing that research practice involves.

By and large, though, public aces to these technologies is sill very new, and we thus sill lack empirical o systmatic studies of the integration of generative AItechnologies into writing practices and processe, for research writig or otherwise. Given how recent these tools were introduced publiy, our research practices have not caught up with the avalabilit of the technologies. In the spirit of researchers and theorists who have argued for the importance of empirical reearch to understanding how technologies shape writing in practice (Haas & Witte, 2001; Clayson, 2018; Takayoshi & Van Ittersum, 2018; Rule, 2019), I approached this exploratory study with an opennessand curiosty about the role generative Al technologies can play in writing practice. I further informed my research questions by the critical literature I have reviewed, which describes thes technologie tendency toward both inventional promise and overly objective, authoritative prose. This led me to the following questions, which anchored my study:

How can we describe the interactions between humans and text generation software technologies as they are enacted in the embodied practice of research writing? . What implications do these embodied practices have for our understandings about written invention in research writing?

# Methods and procedures for an exploration of generative AI and research writing

Methodologically, the article reports from a qualitative analysis of writing practices enacted in 35 videos that depict individuals using generative Al in research writing. My qualitative analysis is informed by a post-positivist orientation, by which I mean that I aim for transparency and reflexivity in communicating my qualitative choices and acknowledge my own subjectivity and interpretive influence in study design and analysis. I is further anchored by a commitment to study writing as an embodied practice that is lived and experienced. For purposes of this research, I begin with Wte and Haas (2001) clam that writing and even digtl writing \*ental [s] bodily performances of many kinds: the manipulatio f fingers, hands, arms, the orientation and poitioning of the body, the use f visual, aural, and tactile senses" (p. 414). Tim Lockridge and Derek Van Itersum's (2020) more recent concept of writing workflows emerges from a similar interest in how routines and technological interactions comprise writing as a lived experience. Building on a sociocultural proces theorie, Lockridge and Van Itersum theorize workflows not only to describe the experience of writing as a chain of events but also to trace how workflow thinking offers writers the opportunity to consider intentionally how material, technologies, and scenes shape writing potential. Similar to prior mediated proces research focused on writing in mobile and transient settings (Pigg, 2020), researching multile case studies of writing workflow enables Lockridge and Van Ittersum to offer a vision across multiple individuals writig with a complex technology (in their case, Markdown), while also retaining the sense that different writers orient to technologies in different ways, for different reasons, and with different mediators in play. To understand the impact of a technology like generative Al, embodied approaches enable us to pay closeattention to practice, but to do so while acknowledging that incredibly diverse people will use and integrated this technology in idiosyncratic ways.

While this reearch ultimately reports on higher-level categories of interaction between reearch writers and generative Al tools in a way that generalizes across cases, my research proceeded through a process ftracing series of interactions in video depictions of writing, as we as participnts conios reflections on thse ctions as expresse in spoke words. In the following sctions, I discuss the sample of videos, my embodied practice descriptions, and the structural coding work that translated my impressons into a more coherent and structured set of categories that I report as results.

Data collection and sample of videos

I collected 35 videos that depicted the use of ChatGPT (and Bing in one case) from a query of publicly available materials on YouTube and TikTok. Analyzing publicly available videos from individuals purposefull sharing their practices with others enabled me to move quickly to provide an early systematic analysis of this phenomenon. I began creating my sample by querying YouTube using the keywords "research," "writing," and "ChatGPT." I used "ChatGPT" rather than "generative AI' or "large language model" as a keyword because I believed this technology was more likely to show up in the everyday vernacular as a way to tag relevant content. On YouTube, I primarily accessed instances of experienced researchers posting tutorials about how to integrate ChatGPT into research writing practice. Many of these YouTubers could be described as consultants or influencers and appeared to be explicitly atempting to monetize their digital content contributions. Students or novice researches were a clear audience for these videos, and most content creators identified themselves as professionals, often by working with their own published research texts during the videos. While I sampled no more than 2 videos from any single content creator on YouTube, several content creators responsible for the videos I analyzed have robust channels and followings with many tutorials related to generative AI and/or other practices of academic and research writing. I gathered the first 18 videos that depicted the use of ChatGPT (or Bing in one case) for research writing that were returned to me using this search on YouTube, at which point I was beginning to receive only redundant returns from the same content creators. Itis also important to acknowledge that my own searches and prior application use informed the returns I received from my query. Digital rhetoric scholars studying the rhetorical impact of algorithms have traced how machine logics often persuade through seeming to appeal to user choice (Brock & Shepherd, 2016) while also embodying value systems that may conflict with user interests (Beck, 2016). Automated systems thus shift dynamics of circulation and aces (Laquintano & Vee, 2017) and require that writers and research consider how to write effectively when algorithms become key audiences for writing (Gallagher, 2017).

Given that so much of the content I had sampled from YouTube came from professionals, I began my query of TikTok with the goal of expanding my sample to include more examples of student writing. I ran a search for #research, "writing," and #ChatGPT," paired with the terms #studentlife," #studyhacks," \*#studytime," and #studywithme." These search terms enabled me to add videos that came from students, rather than only from experienced researchers working as digital content creators. Though the videos I sampled depicted students posting videos of their own research practices, these videos should be read as constructed performances rather than capturing "natural' or "authentic responses. I sampled the first 17 videos returned in response to this query that depicted the use of ChatGPT for research writing, at which time I was beginning to receive redundant returns that mirrored the content I had sampled from YouTube. The TikTok videos were all much shorter than the YouTube videos I collected and often presented very short fragments of writing practice.

Overall, the 35 videos in my sample ranged in length from a longest video of $2 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and $_ { 1 5 s }$ to a shortest video of 8 s. In total, the 35 videos totaled $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ 4 min and 53 s of footage for an average video length of 5 min and 5 s per video. See Appendix A for a detailed list of the videos, their creators, and a link to their public location.

Segmenting, observing, and describing embodied practices

After curating my sample, I created two spreadsheets for detailed analysis of the embodied practice of writing in the videos. The first spreadsheet contained columns for recording the duration and description of embodied move writers depicted. Segmenting and time-labeling video data in order to create describable units of activity has been shown to be a useful tool for deriving qualitative meaning from video data sets (Knoblauch & Tuma, 2020). For purposes of this reearch, I defined an embodied move as one basic unit of sequential writing activity that was descriptive of the writer's visible bodily movement in dialogue with their poken interpretation of their actions and purposes. I acknowledge my own role in interpretation of the data in this stage in moving from enacted practice online and into an intrrtative written description as data, and  identified embodied moves in detal in order o identify micro-level moves that would easily be overlooked in cognitive descriptions of proces (Pigg, 2014). Table 1 provides an example of 8 embodied moves that I identified in a sequence of one writer's use of Chat GPT in about two minutes of video data. I identified actions such as copying text using a cursor and keyboard commands, pasting clipboard text into a document, entering a command into ChatGPT, and evaluating writing (as discussed while crolling through a document) as embodied moves. Thus, embodied moves for purposes of this research were short, fleeting activities that usually took place over only a few seconds in the video data.

Another important facet of working with qualitative video data involves understanding the position of the camera and/or perspective aforded to the viewer (Heath et al., 2010). For purposes of this project, videos almost universall depicted the perspective of one browser window, which the video creator visualized using screen capture software. In some cases, the video shifed back and forth from a view of the browser window to a "talking head' shot or view of the speaker embodied at a desk or another workspace.

In total, the first round of descriptive coding segmented and identified 481 units of embodied writing practice from the 35 videos. Table 1 provides an example of what this embodied practice coding looked like for just under two minutes of Video 5. This table describes acommon sequence of moves, in which a writer copied text from outside a generative Al program, paste i into that program in an attempt to trin the technology and contextualize their inquiry, made various requests of ChatGT, and then evaluated the output they received in light of their goals.

In the second spreadshet, I collected transcripts from the videos. For purposes of this research, I did not systematically code this discourse eparately from embodied practice data depicted in the videos. Instead, I used transcripts of spoken discourse to inform my understanding of how the embodied moves I observed lined up with writers stated goals and intentions. In this way, the videos I observed had similar properties to talk-aloud protocols, as content creators often described their own understandings of actions as they were performing them. Table 2 shares transcript material from the same portion of Video 5 that was coded above to ilustrate how spoken discourse corresponded with my descriptions of embodied practice.

Structural coding to create a framework of practices

After reviewing embodied practice coding in dialogue with discourse from the videos, I used structural coding to identify patterns among embodied moves and the spoken discourse transcripts (Saldana, 2016) Structural coding is an approach to make meaning from data by looking for relationships that lie beneath initial oservations. Structural coding has ben used successull for transitioning from coded video data into qualitative findings informed by precise research questions (Snelson et al., 2021).In this case, structural coding enabled me to work from observation of micro-level actions such as copying or pasting text and to link those to ongoing pattens of interaction between reearch writrs and generative Al technologies. In the following section, I present the results of my structural coding, which outline requesting, evaluating, and refining as key practices interacting with generative AI for research writing.

# Requesting, evaluating, and refining generative AI content

Even in this early moment of ChatGPT's availability, students and researchers enact an array of uses for generative Al in the research writing process This article organizes results around three practices that describe the interaction between generative AI interfaces and rearch writers from the writer's persective. Those ractices are requesting, aluating, and refining. By requesting, refer broadly to research writers making various kinds of requests of generative AlI programs to provide diffrent forms of output. By evaluating, I reer to researchers actively analyzing and judging generative Al outut in various ways. Finall, by refining, I refer to actions that attempt to improve a generative AI system's output i order to achieve writer goals. Table 3 identifies and defines more specific uses of generative Al for research writing that all within these categories of requesting, evaluating, and refining. Whilethis framework identifies uses of generative Al across a range of research activitie, it is not intended to be read as a linear process of research writing, nor as a comprehensive ideal approach to using these technologies for research writing.

Not surprisingly, given how generative Al interfaces function, a major interaction between research writers and these programs consisted of making various kinds of requests from the technology. Requesting emerged as a dominant form of interaction, a central activity that triggered and served as a backdrop for the two additional practices of evaluating and refining. I have chosen the word "requesting purposefully to elect the politeness omalit, and also uncertainty that accompanied reearchers' querie. Research writers asked for help with a varity of faily narrowly defined tasks rlated o secondary rearch, pre-writing, early drafting, editing and revision, reaching non-expert audiences, and research design and methodology (see Table 3).

Requests were rarely isolated or singular. Instead, they were often part of iterative chains of interaction in which researchers received output based on their requests and then too teps to evaluate that utput in various ways in order to determine its quality and usefulness for their purposes. Evaluating thus emerged as a second key practice of research writers in this study. As an embodied practice, research writer frequently signaled evaluation of generative AI content by scrolling through recently returned text and highlighting sections while speaking aloud about their impressions about it The spoken verbal discourse of the videos was helpful for verifying that research writers were scrutinizing the merits of ChatGPT output i various ways. Referring to the spoken discourse with While coding for embodied practice led me to understand that researchers were examining ChatGPT's output in order to check reference quality and make sure that references were accurate, to make sure content met their expectations of genre and content coherence, as wel as their own goals and intentions for articulating knowledge. In several videos, researchers evaluated ChatGPT content to determine whether it would be flagged by a plagiarism detector or an AI detector, particularly in videos that seemed to be most directed to novice writers and researchers. Evaluating, then, sometimes referred to the way that a writer scrutinized ChatGPT output to determine whether it met their own thresholds of knowledge about writing, but it also referred to a writer using their own external technologies to determine whether or not ChatGPT outputs would be identified as plagiarism or as AI writing by technologies such as Turnitin.

Based on evaluation of content or their own prior knowledge of how generative AI works, research writer inll worked in various ways to refine and improve content they received from ChatGPT. This took the form of asking follow up queries to receive feedback that was more aligned with their intentions and needs, as well as priming the software to generate beter and more focused text to meet their various needs. Refining including practices such of asking for follow-up advice ater initial requests with the purpose of receiving more creative or detailed output or longer or more elaborated drafting. In addition, it included feeding more information to the software interface in order to better contextualize a request, including providing example or model texts that a researcher hoped to emulate, or providing additional content related to research project that would enable thetchnology to better tailor its output to the specific context at hand. Finl, research writers also frequently repurposed ChatGPT's initial output into a new prompt in order to create more elaborated draft material.

Notably, then, I idntify a potential iterative relationship among requesting, evaluating, and refining in the use of generative AI by research writers sharing what they deemed to be effective uses of the tool. However, many videos only depicted requests in their interactions with ChatGPT and did not actively portray acts of evaluation or refining. In some cases, this was due to the fragmented nature of what the video portrayed; however, in other case, reearchers (often students) did not primarily appear to be concerned with evaluation of content but rather with gaining insight into topics that were difficult for them to understand.

Many requests that lack evaluation offer meaningful information about how and why generative Al tools are attractive for novice researchers. Video 29, for example, at only 8 s long, portrayed astudent working acrossa laptop computer and an e-textbook open on a tablet to the lft of the screen.The screen read, started understanding subjects Smuch better whe  used ChatGPT to explain them to me. I dont have t feel embarrssed about asking too many questions and can get an explanation as detailed or as simple as Ined in seconds." As I will explain in more detail below, requests focused on gaining an understanding of complex secondary research resources were an important use of these technologies among people who identified themseles s students. These users did not generally position themselves as having the authorit to critique return from the technology, which raises questions about how orientations to generative AI may shift considerably with growing disciplinary expertise.

Generative AI for drafting: approaches to pre-writing and writing research genre.

As I have indicated, research writers used ChatGPT for help in pre-writing, drafting, and editing a range of research genres and elements f rech geres wth varying drf complexity from astracts and conusions to tites and prss relse (se Table3). To further elaborat how rearch writers are using generatie l, this section illstrates a few pattns of use that exemlif practices of requesting, evaluating, and/or refining and how these practices interacted together to shape trajectories of research writing.

One common patern of ChatGPT use for extended research writing involved working from an outline, ither one that the writer had created outside of the technology or one that they had asked generative AIto create for them. Writers then evaluated and refined the outline and fed each element from the outline back into ChatGPT in order to create additional writing that elaborated individual key points from the outline. This enabled researchers to piece together multiple smaller chunks of writing, which they could indvidually edit when assembling longer research writing genres. In video 15, for instance, the researcher began by asking ChatGPT to "provide [an] outline for writing research article on feed forward decoupling control of grid connected PV system." Once the outline was provided, the researcher evaluated and provided commentary on each element suggested in the introduction. He then proceeded to copy each element one-by-one and pasted them back into the dialogue box from ChatGPT to request aditional input for each. By proceeding through this iterative process of outlining and then expanding the outline through additional searches, this researcher arrived at many shorter texts that were then copied separately into a Word Document where they would presumably be revised and combined.

Importantly Video 15 also demonstrated the practice of using technologies external to ChatGPT at the end of a sequence of drafting in order to understand whether the text was likely to be understood as plagiarism or as Al generated. I'm going to check the plagiarism, so here I'm going for Turnitin. After uploading the document to Turnitin, the writer confirmed that the document came back as 33 percent plagiarized. His reflection emphasized that this meant the details of the writing were to basic' and needed to be further revised and refined before submitting.

This method of using ChatGPT for drafting in research writing was one that videos seemed to addres to inexperienced researchers (such as students), rather than for researchers with a clear sense of what they wanted to articulate. Several writers using ChatGPT to produce tex i this way positioned it as a method for overcoming writer's block or getting over ifficultie of knowing where to begin with writing a long, complex text. As one researcher directly addressing students put it, \*f I can't figure out how to do step one, [ChatGPT] gives me something to start editing. It gives me something to start working with." Another expressed asimilar sentiment regarding reearch proposals: f you're writing a reearch proposal, and you do not have any idea, like if you do not have any specific ideas about your topic that you have selected, then you can use ChatGPT to help you out.'

This use of ChatGPT to create ideas for a longer text by creating and iterating from a research outline can be contrasted with the use of ChatGPT as a process of more quickly and eficiently outlining and producing text that aligns with what a researcher already knows. In video 17, for instance, the researcher demonstrated how one might write a very detailed prompt in order to request a written research introduction from ChatGP that would align with one's idea for a research project. In this video, the researcher requested an introduction outine and made sgnificant changes to it before asking ChatGPT to rewrit it in such a way that better rflected his study ideas. Discussing the changes he was making to the outline, he detailed the research deign and included these details in the outline so that ChatGPT would generate writing that better reflected the realities of the study that he was planning:

What our inovation is. i the prepectoral breast reconstruction, which means placing an implant over the muscle and what is our control is subpectoral breast reconstruction, which means placing the implant under the muscl. What are our outcomes? Surgical outcomes such as infection, device explanation, which means removing the implant; implant exposure, which means the implant gets exposed through the kin; skin seroma hematoma, taking [a patient] back to the operating room, and patient reported outcome ..] told ChatGPT that this study design is retrospective and that the information is already available in the chart so now it doesnt think that I'm trying to do a systematic review.

The researcher in Video 17 provided all of this information to ChatGPT and then asked it to create an introduction for a research article for a study that included these details. Interestingly, the researcher also included in their prompt that the output generated by ChatGPT should be original and should not include plagiarism. The researcher in Video 10 similarly discussed using her own genre and content knowledge to evaluate and significantly revise an outline produced by ChatGPT. As she put t, As a chemist, Ineed to change these things. It' not giving me exactly what I would need  just be able to submit t. . Betwen this and this gestring to two items in an outline], I would talk about stroids. I would go .. Sterods are compound, so do this. This is why they're interesting to study and why this is challenging."

In the cases of Videos 17 and 10, the writers tok more authoritative stances toward refining or evaluating the content produced through ChatGPT and depicted themselves making more substantial edits to generated text. They did not employ plagiarism checks as part of their process presumably because they believed that their processes of editing or prompt refining made it o that the resulting writing could not be plagiarized and was instead the product of their own knowledge and contributions. Whereas researchers such as the one depicted in Video 15 appeared to be asking ChatGPT to generate potential ideas for a research study including theoretical frameworks and methodological choices, Video 17 positioned the technology more as a conduit to clearly and efficiently state what had already been determined by the researcher.

Generative AI for secondary research: invention and authority

In addition to using generative Al for different approaches to draftin, researchers also employed ChatGPT extensively for finding, understanding, and extracting information from secondary source material. From queries to produce particular citations to summaries of individual articles or broader topics, research writers used generative Al to provide information about new research areas and to extract the most meaningful information from studies. As with the contrast in different approaches to drafting, analyzing various approaches to using gnerative A for aecondary literature review also suggsted different rientations to the authorit f the content produced through ChatGPT as wel as the capacity of the technology to participate not only in recording knowledge but also in shaping details of study design and contribution.

The researcher in Video 12, for instance, described ChatGPT as helpful for making sense of the bulk of research available to him, providing a means to both sort through long documents and the breadth of available content in order to pinpoint relevant and useful material. \*When dealing with the literature and these massive documents, he suggested, it just makes i so much easier. In the same video, this researcher advocated for using ChatGPT not only to summarize scholarly research, but also to analyze the strengths and weaknesses f liteatre in ways that inite ides about ne rearch gaps toddress. s he ut it \*Weakns  think are grat place to start if you're looking at bulding on top of someone else's research. So the material. . .uh the process involves multiple steps and materials, so it's a space for inventing] research questions and gaps." Here ChatGPT was positioned not as a neutral technology for gaining accessto knowledge inherent in an article, but instead as having analytical promise that researchers could exploit i order to invent ideas for future research..

Again, as with drafting, other researchers were more likely to position generative Al technologies either as suspect in their bility to provide accurate information about prior research or as neutral analysts that lacked the expert knowledge that would be needed in order to create accurate and compeling reviews of scholarly literature. Video 11, for instance, depicted a researcher critiquing ChatGPT's explanation of the literature comparing mangroves and salt marsh responses to sea level rise. In response to the generated text, the researcher asked for refined contribution by writing, \*Well that's not entirely accurate. Both mangroves and salt marshes accumulate root matter contributing to soil volume and upward expansion of the sol surface." ChatGPT responded by acknowledging its mistake and modifying its statements. The researcher depicted in Video 10 similarly emphasized that while generative Al might be helpful in grasping the most important points and contributions of particular research genres, only researchers with expertise in a subject matter would be able to frame those key points in such a way that meaningfull poitioned their own studie. As she put it, I highly suggest using this to summarize your research papers to get an idea of what's going on and you know the litrature at the time." She continued, "But once you've done that you need to really come through. What's your story? What's the storyline? How are you connecting things together? Because if you're not doing that, you're gonna have a lot harder time in getting accepted into journals because you're not producing a high-quality review."

# Towards a future of embodied studies of generative AI in research writing

Explicating her approach to studying embodied practices of writing, layson (2018) argued that new technologie "excite writing scholars" because of their otential for transforming writing practice, but, t is important to continually investigate writers practies, to see if/what practices are actually changing, and perhaps where practice ersist (pg. 220). This study has identified real-world uses of generative AI for research writing that align with practices that scientist have speculated would be central to ChatGPT's uptake including \*finding academic papers, summarizing their conclusions, and highlighting areas of uncertainty," generating text as "a starting point for human-based development ofthe text," and \*the editing process (Salvagno, 2023p. 2). In addition, the stud ffers initial compelling evidence to support claims that ChatGPT willbe asociated with recursive cycles of \*prompt-engineering, output curation, fact-checking, and revision that become an orthogonal dimension to traditional writing and learning proceses (Graham, 2023, p. 166). Finall, the study provides an initial sense that, following Bill Hart-Davidson's argument (2018), the most effective writers working with generative Al content will nee to dwell in the realm of evaluation and revision, drawing on both writing and content expertise to engage and critique output..

Importantly, the study also suggests that we must be careful in any atempts to generalize about the early uptake of research writing with generative AI technologies, which does not emerge as a singular phenomenon in this study. Instead, analyzing the micro-level practices of 35 writers sugests a great deal of variation in how research writers are orienting to the inventive possbilitie of the technology in ways that suggest multiple posible future trajectories. Simultaneousl, we have early adopters who are positioning the technology as a way to invent study designs and ideas and early adopters who position the technology as a conduit that can more efficiently channel researchers' preexisting knowledge. Some researchers advocated for and demonstrated using ChatGPT to request ideas for appropriate methodologies, theoretical approaches, and objectives to ground research studies. Others drew harder lines around the capabilites of the technology to participate in the knowledge-making enterpris of science and social science, differentiating more strongly between human knowledge and machine text generation. As the researcher in Video 9 described, If you are looking for the too that can write a research paper for you, then that i actually not possible. The researcher in Video 10 expresse a similar sentiment: \*Al i not going to be able to writ [a literature review] like a researcher who knows that field can write. It doesn't understand the complexitie. Its never sat and collected data. he followed up, f you literlly just want to put in a prompt have it write a lit review so that you can publish it, you really have to question your motives for being in this career field."

Some variation around the positioning of generative AI emerged as related to experience and expertise in both research and writing. While experienced researchers tended to enact practices that they described as expediting already familiar proceses, students were more likely to express more awe about the ability for generative AI to help them move past their dfficulties in reading comprehension or in getting started writing unknown genres. As the reearcher in Video 28 put it I dont think thisis cheating, but Ijust genuinely can't read and comprehend at the same time,so I aked ChatGPT to summarize the article that I have to read. The student goes on to call thi is "a game changer." Her sentiment relates to that of the researcher in Video 19 who advocated for using ChatGPT to put complex readings into simpler language to avoid the embarrassment of asking too many questions. These videos suggest that students are turning to ChatGPT when they are experiencing struggles and dificulties that are likely to be invisible to faculty members. Furthermore, many of the professonal and student researchers represented through this sample are multilingual writers speaking global Englishes and prent as the very kinds of researchers that scholars like Gonzales and Berdejo-Espinola and Amano have argued may benefit from the power of these tools for accessing Standard English varieties.

# Conclusion

Overall the framework offered in this article provides a descriptive starting point that future researchers can reference when generating interview, survey, or observational protocols to further study the effcts of these technologies. For teachers and students, this framework ofers an accessible way to name and describe moves that students may already be using privately,so that they can discuss ssues f ethics, invention, riginalit, and productivity relaed to these writing practices. And finll, this artcl contributes one of the first descriptive analyses of ChatGPT-supported research writing practices, whilealso demonstrating the importance of continuing and further refining our research into embodied writing practice.

While the study offers a useful starting place for future research focused on the embodied practice of research writing with generative AI, the research has significant limitations. My preference would have been to have collected video sample from participants working in naturalistic environments. Doing so would have enabled me to ensure their consent, view and learn from their surroundings, and talk to them dirtly about their ols. intend to do that work in the future. However, although there re limitations and ethical concerns to working with publicly available video data on outlets where content creators did not intend to become research participants, elieve this move is justified when there is dire need to beter understand current practice with  new technology and When the research is practiced with respect for the participants practice, eliefs, and knowledge. My researchis also limited by the scope of embodied writing activity that is depicted in these videos: almost all embodied writing activity I analyzed involved interactions within the space of one browser window, as writers shifted from ChatGPT to word processors or other relevant writing technologie. Future reearch wil need to asss te relationship between gerative Al technologies and releant participants outside the constraints of an individual browser window. For this reason, the reults of this research willnot always emphasize how writers or generative Al technologies were in relationship with other material, though many other software interfaces, including word processors, search engines, writing paraphrasers, plagiarism checkers, and PDF readers were important actors. Future research willneed to shift outward from the concentrated attention on this singular user-technology relationship and toward the broader network of participants in research writing scenes. Furthermore, the status of the videos as designed social media artifacts meant that writers typically did not depict themselves going off task, divertig from their initial goal, or organizing the time of a work session in way that could be described as naturalisic. Instead, their goals generally were to showcase features and/or uses of generative Al technology, and thus future research willneed study how the implementation of ChatGPT works when incorporated into more naturalistic writing workflows and settings.

Despite these imitations, early adopters ffer clues into both why research writers are reaching for generative Al technologies and to the implications of their activity for theevolution of reearch writing practices. Many rearch writers are loking to ChatG in one of two scenarios. In one cenario, they are turning to this tool when they are stuck or strugglig to ffer solutions to ongoing problems with reading comprehension, writer's block, and/or understanding genre conventions. In another scenario, they are turning to the tool to met the ever-increasing demands of productivity that require we do more with limited time. In both cases, generative AI technology for some offers a short-term solution that feel game changing' tostudents and professionals who shared their sessins in public forums. In the long-term, however, it remains to be sen whether using these tools to overcome writing struggles wil translate into longer term writing learning and development, as wellas whether these technologies will merely amp up increasing expectations for writing productivity.
