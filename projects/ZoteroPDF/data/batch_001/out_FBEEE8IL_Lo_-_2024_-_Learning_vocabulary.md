# ABSTRACT

With the rise of computer-assisted online learning tools such as the Language Reactor, advanced captioning options such as dual subtitles (i.e. simultaneous display of on-screen texts in the first language and the second/foreign language) have gained much attention. However, little is known about how dual-subtitled viewing may be optimised to foster second/ foreign language learning in multimedia learning environments. In this study, I extended Laufer and Hulstijn (Applied Linguistics, 22(1), 1–26, 2001) Involvement Load Hypothesis (ILH) to the context of audiovisual input and examined the effects of dual-subtitled viewing under multiple ILH-based interventions on vocabulary learning. University Chinese-speaking low-intermediate EFL learners $( \mathsf { n } = 7 2 )$ were divided into four groups and exposed to dual-subtitled videos with varying ILH-based interventions. Using a counterbalanced $4 \times 4$ experimental design, I compared learners’ immediate vocabulary gains and retention of target words under four different treatments across four experimental sessions, including interventions featuring an involvement load of 4 (moderate need $^ +$ search $^ +$ strong evaluation), an involvement load of 3 (moderate need $^ +$ search $^ +$ moderate evaluation), an involvement load of 2 (moderate $n e e d + s e a r c h )$ , and an involvement load of 0 (absence of need, search or evaluation). The approach to data analysis was twofold: between-groups and within-groups. ANOVA results revealed that vocabulary gains were the highest when learners viewed dual-subtitled videos under treatments with higher involvement loads. The article ends with a consideration of practical and theoretical implications for language learning through this form of audiovisual multimedia learning condition.

# Introduction

Ample studies in the field of applied psycholinguistics and language education have demonstrated the potential of audiovisual materials and captioning for second/foreign (L2)1 language gains ranging from word recognition to meaning recall, although evidence on the differential facilitative effects of varying caption conditions remains inconclusive (e.g. Montero Perez, 2022; Vanderplank, 2016). In the increasingly technology-enhanced world, various kinds of multimedia captions, such as subtitles in the first language (L1), full captions in the second/foreign language (L2), partial captions, keyword captions, glossed captions and dual subtitles, can easily be accessed and exploited for language teaching or learning, although to date the effects of different caption conditions on learners’ vocabulary learning or comprehension have remained inconclusive (Danan, 2004; Montero Perez, 2022). Among all, dual subtitles, where L1 and L2 are concurrently displayed on screen, are becoming increasingly popular among Chinese-speaking English as a foreign language (EFL) learners and increasing studies have pointed to its potential for vocabulary learning (e.g. Dizon & Thanyawatpokin, 2021; Fievez et  al., 2020; Lwo & Lin, 2012; Wang & Pellicer‐Sánchez, 2022).

However, empirical evidence of the effects of dual-subtitled videos on vocabulary learning remains scarce (e.g. Dizon & Thanyawatpokin, 2021; Wang, 2019; Wang & Pellicer‐Sánchez, 2022). Most of the relevant works have mostly been set out to investigate how the effectiveness of dual subtitles compares to other captioning conditions (e.g. L1 subtitles, L2 captions, or no caption), and their obtained results have mostly been based on the viewing of a single episode resulting from one experimental session (i.e. a one-time result as opposed to results from multiple experimental sessions). Moreover, the focus has been exclusively on viewing dual-subtitled videos without instructional interventions.2 That is to say, even if such audiovisual input is found to have positive effects (e.g. Wang & Pellicer‐Sánchez), how it may be optimised for vocabulary learning remains unexplored. For instance, the facilitative role of instructional interventions such as pre-viewing has received increasing attention in the context of other captioned/subtitled video conditions (e.g. Montero Perez, 2019; Pujadas & Muñoz, 2019), but it remains unclear whether the same results apply to viewing dual-subtitled videos or how the operationalisation of instructional interventions may be informed by theoretical considerations to foster vocabulary learning.

Laufer and Hulstijn (2001) Involvement Load Hypothesis (ILH) is one of the few constructs in second/foreign language learning that is operationalisable and precisely provides theoretical relevance for why certain L2 activities surpass others in fostering vocabulary learning. According to this motivational-cognitive construct of involvement, learning conditions with a greater degree of involvement load (i.e. mental effort operationalised by involvement factors ranging from ‘need’, ‘search’, and ‘evaluation’) can lead to greater vocabulary gains. For example, in examining the impact of involvement load on L2 learners’ retention of ten target words, Hulstijn and Laufer (2001) found that experimental learning conditions with the highest involvement load (i.e. composition using target words) yielded the highest retention, as compared to experimental conditions with lower involvement load such as reading plus gap-filling exercises and reading comprehension. To date, the ILH has triggered numerous research efforts to explore the outcomes of different activities on second/foreign language vocabulary acquisition in the second language acquisition (SLA) literature. However, whether the ILH holds in the context of audiovisual media remains unknown.

The main objective of this quasi-experimental study is to investigate the impacts of viewing dual-subtitled videos under four different types of ILH-based interventions. The results of this study are expected to shed light on whether and in what way dual subtitles may be utilised to foster L2 vocabulary learning.

# Literature review

# Theoretical framework behind the use of audiovisual materials for L2 learning

A considerable body of literature has demonstrated the positive impacts of audiovisual materials3 on second/foreign language learning (Alm, 2019; Dizon, 2018; Jiang et  al., 2017; Lee et  al., 2021; Montero Perez, 2022; Plass & Jones, 2005; Rodgers & Webb, 2020; Wang & Chen, 2020; Webb & Rodgers, 2009; Wong & Neuman, 2021). Two prominent theories that may explain this positive correlation between audiovisual materials and language learning can primarily be drawn from Paivio’s (1990, 2014) Bilingual Dual Coding Theory (BDCT) and Mayer’s (2001) cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML). The Bilingual Dual Coding Theory assumes that (1) one of the two cognitive subsystems in human cognition specialises in processing imagery and nonverbal representation, while the other specialises in dealing with language; (2) the systems function in a separate but interconnected manner that may make L2 input more comprehensible and memory more easily retrievable (Paivio, 1990, 2014; Paivio & Desrochers, 1980).

The advantages of audiovisual input for language learning can also be informed by the CTML (Mayer, 2001; Mayer et  al., 2014), which posits that learners can process novice information more effectively through simultaneous use of verbal (spoken or written) and visual channels. Meanwhile, Mayer (2001) identified twelve multimedia instructional principles, including the coherence principle, the redundancy principle, the spatial and temporal contiguity, the segmenting principle, the pertaining principle, the modality principle, the multimedia principle, the voice principle, and the image principle. These principles were distinguished based on three types processing demands on learners’ cognitive load, including the need to (1) reduce extraneous processing, (2) manage essential processing, and (3) foster generative processing. These frameworks have been regarded as important instructional design goals for multimedia learning and many of which have been applied to studies on L2 learning through audiovisual input (e.g. Montero Perez, 2022; Sweller, 2005; Wang, 2019). However, empirical investigations into how different types of captioned/ subtitled videos may contribute to vocabulary learning are still limited.

# Vocabulary learning through captioned videos

An area that has drawn much attention in the literature on audiovisual input for language learning is the use of captioned/subtitled videos4 (Bisson et  al., 2014; Danan, 2004; Frumuselu et  al., 2015; Gass et  al., 2019; Hsieh, 2020; Kaderoğlu & Esquerré, 2021; Peters, 2019). On-screen texts prevailing in existing multimedia and technology-enhanced SLA literature include L1 subtitles and L2 captions. Both subtitling and captioning are on-screen texts added to dialogues, but the former involves the translation of one medium into another (e.g. L1–L2 or L2–L1), while the latter enables audiences to visualize the speech in the same language (e.g. L1–L1 or L2–L2) as the audio (Danan, 2004). In this study, ‘L1 subtitles’ refer to the corresponding ‘L1 translation of the L2 audio’ presented in the on-screen text area, while ‘L2 captions’ refer to the ‘verbatim transcription’ of L2 audio displayed in the on-screen text area (Montero Perez, 2022, p. 165). The term ‘dual subtitles’ is used to refer to a captioning condition where a pair of L1 subtitles and L2 captions are simultaneously displayed on-screen.

While the premise behind Paivio’s (1971, 2014) and Mayer’s (2001) theories may explain why audiovisual materials such as videos can foster language learning, the use of captioned/subtitled videos for language learning is not without controversy. Some studies question the potential adverse effects of such multimodal techniques from the perspective of extraneous processing and the ‘redundancy principle’, which argues that presenting the same information through a combination of graphics, spoken text, and printed text may hinder learning (Mayer, 2001; Mayer & Fiorella, 2014; Sweller, 2005). However, in a subsequent experiment, Mayer et  al. (2014, p. 654) found that L2 learners who were given on-screen captions alongside a narrated animation (subtitle group) did not exhibit a significant difference in their retention or transfer scores compared to those who were only given a narrated animation (no-subtitle group). This implies that the inclusion of captions did not hinder learning as the ‘redundancy principle’ would predict and that ‘redundancy’ might function reversely in the context of L2 learning. Lee and Mayer (2018) reinforced the evidence for such reverse redundancy theory in their study, where Korean college students exhibited greater L2 learning gains when given a captioned video compared to an uncaptioned video. In light of all new evidence, Mayer et  al. (2020, p. 848) later suggested that the ‘redundancy principle’ should be reversed in the context of learning from video documentaries in a second language and proposed the ‘subtitle principle’, which asserts that redundant information in the form of printed words (such as the case of captions) may facilitate comprehension in cases where learners have difficulty identifying words. Although Mayer et al. (2020) addressed the effects of redundant on-screen texts (i.e. captions or subtitles) on L2 learners’ comprehension, the implications of their findings may be extended to vocabulary learning, which lays the foundation for comprehension. Nevertheless, whether the ‘subtitle principle’ holds for other captioned conditions is yet to be explored. For example, it is still unknown whether such principle applies to multimodal input with dual subtitles.

Although evidence on learning gains from different forms of on-screen texts remains inconclusive, many studies have pointed to the facilitative role of captions and subtitles in vocabulary learning. While watching videos alone may potentially foster incidental vocabulary learning (Peters & Webb, 2018), captioned videos can be even more effective due to the presence of multimodal contextual cues. By enabling learners to access vocabulary knowledge via both auditory and visual domains, captioned videos facilitate learners to deconstruct language chunks and acquire new words while reinforcing knowledge structures (Teng, 2019, 2020; Vanderplank, 2016; Winke et  al., 2010). For example, exposure to L2 captions may help bridge the gap between learners’ listening comprehension and reading comprehension skills (which are usually relatively better developed), thereby making the audio input more intelligible and contributing to vocabulary building and word recognition (Danan, 2004; Garza, 1991). In addition to being attention-directing cues, captions may also benefit word recognition and recall by enabling learners to visualise aural cues phonologically and better understand ambiguous input (Bird & Williams, 2002; Peters & Webb, 2018; Teng, 2022b). They also have the potential in improving learners’ language processing ability and raising learners’ awareness of expressions or terminology unknown to them (Vanderplank, 1988). However, L2 captions may offer limited benefits for vocabulary learning in scenarios where the audiovisual material is too fast or contains too many L2 words far beyond learners’ linguistic competence. Instead, L1 subtitles may be more beneficial to less skilled learners by enabling them to establish paired equivalents through the written translations on-screen and recognise new L2 words which may otherwise be bypassed (Koolstra & Beentjes, 1999). To date, a considerable body of studies has generally pointed to the superiority of captioned videos (including captions and subtitles) in drawing L2 learners’ attention to unfamiliar words, stimulating an initial form-meaning mapping, and benefiting meaning recall (Montero Perez, 2022; Montero Perez et  al., 2013, 2015, 2018; Puimège & Peters, 2019; Syodorenko, 2010; Teng, 2022a, 2022b; Wang, 2019; Winke et  al., 2010, 2013; Zhang & Zou, 2021). As Danan (2004, p. 76) puts it, ‘without the availability of captions and subtitles, the complexity and transient nature of the audiovisual input often make it difficult for language learners to truly comprehend foreign utterances’. However, research on the effects of captioned videos on vocabulary learning has not yielded consistent results, which can be heavily affected by the educational settings and different learning conditions, such as the type of captioned videos involved, learners’ proficiency level, or the presence/absence of different pre-viewing conditions (Montero Perez et  al., 2018; Suarez & Gesa, 2019; Teng, 2022a).

# Viewing captioned videos with instructional interventions

Recent works in this area have explored how specific experimental factors such as instructional interventions (e.g. pre-viewing treatments) may mediate the effects of learning vocabulary through viewing captioned videos (Montero Perez, 2019; Pujadas & Muñoz, 2019). For example, Montero Perez (2019) found that instructional interventions through pre-learning activities can offer an enhanced effect on stimulating form-meaning mappings as they help direct learners’ attentional resources to target words. Pujadas and Muñoz (2019) found that learners who were exposed to pre-viewing interventions such as gap-filling and matching exercises (i.e. focused instruction group) outperformed learners who were not given any pre-viewing intervention (i.e. non-focused group) in terms of meaning recall, regardless of whether L1- or L2-captioned videos being adopted. Other studies examined whether or in what way interventions such as enhancement techniques and advance-organizer activities seeking to enhance learners’ noticing and attention fostered vocabulary learning or comprehension through captioned videos. Advance organizers are introductory visual and graphic materials to help learners connect ideas, concepts, and facts in a learning activity, such as concept maps or episodic pictures (Chung & Huang, 1998). Earlier works in this area have suggested that pre-viewing interventions such as advance organizers could enhance learners’ comprehension of the content in video viewing tasks (Chung & Huang, 1998; Herron, 1994). More recently, scholars have begun to extend the investigation to vocabulary learning.

For example, Teng (2019) found that incorporating advance organizer activities before captioned video viewing (i.e. pre-viewing intervention) helped to enhance the learning of L2 collocation among primary school students. In his more recent work, Teng (2022a, p. 525) examined whether presenting ‘unfamiliar vocabulary words in sentences that depict events in scenario-based schemata’ could help to draw learners’ attention and promote video-based vocabulary learning. Likewise, the work by Gesa and Miralpeix (2022) also pointed to the facilitative role that subtitled video viewing tasks with pedagogical interventions play in fostering vocabulary learning, but significant differences were only observed among learners at intermediate levels. However, to date, many of the existing studies on the effects of pre-viewing interventions have primarily examined incidental vocabulary learning, where learners were not notified in advance of any post-tests (e.g. Teng, 2019, 2022a). Scant attention has been paid to the outcomes of pre-viewing interventions or activities in an intentional learning setting. Moreover, more research on the effects of viewing captioned videos under instructional interventions operationalised in different ways is needed in order to understand how pedagogical interventions may be designated to facilitate L2 learning.

# The rise of dual subtitles

With new computer-assisted technology such as the user-friendly Chrome browser add-on Language Reactor (https://www.languagereactor.com/) enabling easy access to advanced captioning options, a growing body of studies are exploring the pedagogical values of glossed captions (e.g. Fievez et  al., 2021; Hsieh, 2020) and dual subtitles (also known as bilingual subtitles), where L1 and L2 subtitles are simultaneously displayed in parallel at the bottom of the screen. The potential facilitative effects of dual subtitles may be drawn from Paivio’s (1990, 2014) bilingual dual coding theory, which contends that visual traces (image) plus two distinct sets of verbal input (L2 audio $+ \mathrm { L } 1$ subtitles) can have additive effects on L2 learning. This theory provides some explanation for the potential benefits of L1 subtitles. However, whether it holds in the context of dual subtitles, which involve visual input plus three distinct sets of verbal input (L2 audio $+ \mathrm { L } 1$ subtitle $s + \mathrm { L } 2$ captions), remains to be investigated with empirical tests.

While this type of on-screen help option has been perceived positively (e.g. García, 2017) and has prevailed among EFL learners as an approach for L2 learning (e.g. Chen, 2004; Liao et  al., 2020), its potential benefits for L2 learning have only recently attracted scholarly attention (Chang, 2003; Dizon & Thanyawatpokin, 2021; Hao et  al., 2022; Lwo & Lin,

2012; Smith, 2019; Wang, 2019; Wang & Pellicer‐Sánchez, 2022). In comparing the effects of dual-subtitled videos with three other types of captioned videos, Lwo and Lin (2012) found that the L2-captioned and dual-subtitled groups outperformed the L1-subtitled and non-captioned groups in terms of comprehension, but these preliminary findings were only based on self-reports and there was no specific reference to unknown words. Dizon and Thanyawatpokin (2021) found that learners viewing dual-subtitled L2 videos outperformed those viewing L1- and L2-subtitled videos in terms of comprehension but did not perform significantly better than those who had viewed L1-subtitled videos in terms of vocabulary learning. Wang’s (2019) study was one of the few that provided empirical evidence of the benefits of dual-subtitled videos for vocabulary learning. Wang and Pellicer‐Sánchez (2022) found that dual subtitles were less effective than L2 captions at fostering form recognition but were more conducive to meaning recognition and meaning recall compared to L1 subtitles. However, both of these studies only administered immediate posttests, so there was no evidence of vocabulary retention from viewing dual-subtitled videos.

Studies on the effects of dual subtitles on vocabulary learning are scarce, with most existing ones largely confined to whether dual-subtitled videos are superior to other types of captioning conditions for listening comprehension and vocabulary learning. Many pedagogical questions on the values of dual-subtitled video viewing on vocabulary learning remain unanswered, such as the effectiveness of dual subtitles for vocabulary learning and what factors may mediate the effect of such multimodal input. An intriguing question is whether and to what extent instructional interventions for viewing activities may benefit from the perspective of ‘involvement load’ (IL), a notion which has been proposed by Laufer and Hulstijn (2001) and has since then been constantly revisited and tested in SLA studies on vocabulary learning from various aspects (e.g. Hulstijn $\&$ Laufer, 2001; Keating; 2008; Kim, 2008; Nation, 2013).

# The involvement load hypothesis

In recognising the need to operationalise cognitive notions in a way that allows vocabulary learning activities to be more observable and measurable, Laufer and Hulstijn (2001) developed the ILH, positing that the sum of the prominence degrees of the ‘need, search and evaluation’ factors reflects the load of a vocabulary learning task. Need, which refers to the motivational, noncognitive dimension of involvement, can be operationalised by examining the absence/presence of learners’ need to know words targeted in a task. Need can be moderate (marked as 1) when imposed by an external agent and strong (marked as 2) when self-imposed. Search and evaluation are the cognitive dimension of involvement. Search involves the attempt to find the meaning or form of an unknown L2 vocabulary through means such as dictionary consultation and only has one prominence degree (i.e. present $= 1$ ; absent $= 0$ ). Evaluation entails comparing and assessing the meaning or form of an L2 word based on the context and can be either moderate $\left( = 1 \right)$ when only recognition of differences is involved, or strong $( = 2 )$ when learner-created contexts are involved. According to Hulstijn and Laufer (2001), word retention is generally conditional upon the degrees of involvement load in the given learning conditions. Those inducing greater involvement loads have more substantial effects on meaning retention than those inducing lower involvement loads.

To date, the ILH has triggered numerous research efforts to explore the outcomes of different activities on second/foreign language vocabulary acquisition in the SLA literature as it is precise and operationalisable. While some studies provided inconclusive evidence or counterevidence (Folse, 2006; Laufer, 2003), many showed strong evidence aligning with the prediction of ILH that learning conditions with a greater degree of involvement load led to greater vocabulary gains (Bao, 2015; Eckerth & Tavakoli, 2012; Huang et  al., 2012; Keating, 2008; Kim, 2008; Pichette et  al., 2012). For example, Keating (2008) compared the effects of three approaches to vocabulary learning: sentence writing $\left( \mathrm { I L } \right) = \mathrm { \ } 3 \mathrm { \ ' }$ ), reading plus fill-in-the-blank $( \mathrm { I L } = 2 )$ ), and reading only (IL $= 1 \dot { }$ ). The results showed that participants in the higher involvement load group (sentence writing) outperformed the other two groups in terms of vocabulary retention. However, as the construct of involvement load was primarily developed under incidental learning conditions (Laufer, 2020; Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001), there has been little evidence as to how it may hold in intentional learning conditions despite some scholarly inquiry (e.g. Hua & Guo, 2021; Keating, 2008). Moreover, to the best of my knowledge, no studies have been set out to investigate whether and to what extent ILH may apply to the context of vocabulary learning through audiovisual input. In light of the significant impacts that ILH have on learners’ L2 vocabulary gains in the ILH literature, the assumption is that pre-viewing interventions informed by the ILH frameworks may provide practical insights and contribution to the optimal use of subtitled/captioned videos for vocabulary learning. This is also an important area where this study makes an original contribution to research on audiovisual input for vocabulary learning.

# The present study

The current quasi-experimental study aims to fill the literature gap by investigating the effects of viewing dual-subtitled videos under ILH-based interventions on vocabulary learning in EFL classrooms. Particular interest lies in the extent to which dual-subtitled video viewing under four ILH-based interventions may facilitate L2 vocabulary gains and retention among EFL learners. The following research questions guided the study:

1. To what extent does viewing dual-subtitled videos under different ILH-based interventions stimulate immediate vocabulary gains?   
2. To what extent does viewing dual-subtitled videos under different ILH-based interventions lead to vocabulary retention?

# Method

This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of viewing dual-subtitled videos under different ILH-based interventions on L2 learners’ immediate gains and retention of ten English words in a regular classroom setting. The audiovisual input for this study was sourced from English (L2) documentaries available on Netflix.5 The investigation focused on the learners’ receptive knowledge (i.e. meaning retention of target words). In this study, vocabulary/word retention refers to participants’ ability to correctly define the target vocabulary items by providing their L1 equivalents, L2 explanation, or L2 synonyms.

# Participants

Data was collected from a total of 72 participants, aged 18–21 years old, who were recruited using convenience sampling. They were low-intermediate EFL students enrolled in a general English course at a university in Macao, with at least 12 years of English learning experience. These participants had Chinese as their first language (L1), and none had studied abroad to learn English. They were randomly assigned into four groups, each consisting of 18 participants. They were informed that their participation was completely voluntary and assured that their identity would remain confidential. All participants’ names were coded as N1-72 for data analysis to preserve anonymity.

# Instruments and materials

# Dual-subtitled videos

The four videos adopted in this study were four 15-minute narrated Netflix documentaries shown at a slow pace6 (Table 1). This is in line with implications from Mayer et  al. (2020)’ subtitle principle’, which calls for a slower-paced video if subtitles were to be included to stimulate vocabulary learning. Dual subtitles were made available through the Chrome extension Language Reactor, as exemplified in Figure 1. All four groups of participants were presented with the same dual-subtitled videos regardless of the treatments (i.e. interventions) involved.

# Target words

Ten mid-frequency words, identified through transcripts made available via the Language Reactor, were judiciously selected from the concerned Netflix documentary for each experimental session. Table 1 illustrates the details of the target words and their sources over the four experimental sessions.

Four factors guided the selection of target words. First, they were unknown/unfamiliar to the participants based on their instructor’s assessment. Second, they were all mid-frequency words according to Nation’s (2013) classification of word families between the 4000 and the 9000 frequency levels, i.e. words beyond the BNC-COCA 4000-word family level (K4–K9). The frequency level of the target words was analysed using Vocabprofile on the Compleat Lexical Tutor website (Cobb, 2021). Third, they were piloted with a separate group of L2 learners $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 9 \right)$ ) with similar proficiency levels. Lastly, three weeks before the experiment proper, one last procedure7 was carried out to ensure the target words were indeed unknown to participants. The participants of the present study were given a list of 90 words consisting of all target words involved in the four experimental sessions plus some other irrelevant words and were asked to indicate their prior knowledge of any words in the given list by writing down their Chinese equivalents or English synonyms.8 Only words that were verified to be unknown by participants were finalised as target words for this study. Hypothetically it was unlikely that such exposure before the main study might significantly affect the study outcomes since participants were not provided with the meaning of the words. Even if it did, it was assumed that the three-week gap could minimise effects. This assumption was later confirmed in the immediate posttests, where participants were asked to circle target words that they knew before treatments, and none indicated any.

# Treatments

The four ILH-based interventions examined in this study include the following four treatments, as illustrated in Table 2.

Treatment A (TA).  Prior to viewing, participants were provided with the target words and asked to guess their meaning. After viewing, participants were told to write their opinion about the video using the words from the same list: ‘In writing your opinion about what you have just watched, you must use the words from the given list in whatever order you prefer’. In terms of involvement load, this treatment is associated with an involvement index of 4. Need is moderate as it is imposed by the teacher (i.e. learners are aware of the need to define the target words). Search is likely to occur when learners try to search for the meaning of an unknown L2 word from the audiovisual input with dual subtitles. A strong evaluation shall be induced when learners evaluate the new words in a learner-generated context.

Treatment B (TB).  Participants were also provided with ten target words and asked to guess their meaning before viewing an L2 video with dual subtitles, thus inducing a moderate need and search. They were then asked to complete a fill-in activity comprising examples of the target words drawn from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English Online (LDOCE). This treatment differs from TA in that a moderate evaluation is likely to occur as learners only need to recognise differences between the target words. In terms of involvement load, this treatment is associated with an involvement index of 3 [1(moderate need) $+ 1 \ ( s e a r c h ) \ + \ 1$ (moderate evaluation).]

a This shall be an involvement load of 2 only if learners happen to indicate a self-imposed need for all concerned target words.

Treatment C (TC).  Participants were asked to guess the meaning of ten target words before viewing an L2 video with dual subtitles, but no followup exercise was requested. In terms of involvement load, this treatment is associated with an involvement index of 2 [1 (moderate need) $+ 1$ (search)].

Treatment $D$ $^ { \prime T D \} }$ .  In this experimental condition, participants were not given any list of target words in advance and were simply asked to watch an L2 video with dual subtitles. Strictly speaking, this treatment is comparable to a learning condition with no instructional interventions, except for a verifying procedure asking participants to indicate any word they deem necessary to look up. Hence, unless participants indicate a self-imposed need for all target words (which means an involvement index of 2 due to a strong need), this treatment is regarded as an ILH-based intervention that does not impose any need, search or evaluation and is associated with an involvement index of 0 (i.e. the lowest index).

# Posttests

Four sets of immediate posttests and delayed posttests were designed to measure participants’ vocabulary gains and retention arising from each experimental condition. The immediate and delayed posttests administered (after each treatment) were identical, both consisting of the same target words concerned in the respective treatments. In both tests, participants were asked to define the words through L1 equivalents, L2 explanations, or L2 synonyms. Reliability between posttests for all experimental sessions as measured in a pilot study $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 9 \right)$ was relatively high, with Cronbach’s α ranging between 0.85–0.89. The face and content validity of the posttests was ensured by consulting two ELT professionals.

# Procedures

This study consisted of four experimental sessions. In each session, a 15-minute dual-subtitled video (see Table 1) was shown to participants, with each group being assigned to one of the four ILH-based interventions (i.e. treatments). Eventually, all four groups of participants took part in all kinds of treatments in a different order, as illustrated in Figure 2. This integration of between-subject and within-subject design allows for multiple (4) comparisons of immediate vocabulary gains and vocabulary retention between different groups of participants and those of the same group of participants across the four types of interventions.

Figure 2. Allocation of treatments across experimental sessions.

All four experiments were administered during regular class time over eight weeks in the second semester of Academic Year 2021–2022.9 Participants were briefly informed of the procedures and subsequent posttests.10 Time consumed in the four experimental conditions varied, ranging from 35–40 minutes (TA), 25–30 minutes (TB), 15–20 minutes (TC) to 5–10 minutes (TD). As all treatments inherently involved varying involvement loads, time was considered an inherent feature of each treatment, and thus the difference in time consumption was not treated as a separable variable. In each experimental session, participants were given an immediate posttest upon completion of the corresponding treatment. In the subsequent week, the respective delayed posttest was administered to examine word retention (see Figure 2). A total of four immediate posttests and four delayed posttests were collected from the entire study.

# Scoring and analysis

In the present study, immediate vocabulary gains and retention of the target words were operationalised as correct Chinese equivalents, English synonyms, or English explanations provided for the target words in posttests administered upon completion of the assigned treatments. The maximum score for each posttest was 10. Words that were semantically correctly defined through L1 equivalents, L2 explanations, or L2 synonyms were treated as correct responses and scored 1, while incorrect responses scored 0. Responses were also scored 0 when participants indicated prior knowledge of the word before the treatments (which did not happen as all target words were ensured to be unknown to participants through scrutiny of pre-intervention data). Two independent raters

scored the posttests (the researcher and another ELT professional).   
Inter-rater reliability was $1 0 0 \%$ .

The main foci of statistical analysis for this study were the mean gains (score from 0 to 10) in meaning retention of the target words. The primary independent variable (the factor) in this study was the four conditions of learning vocabulary through viewing dual-subtitled videos: TA (involvement index of 4), TB (involvement index of 3), TC (involvement index of 2), and TD (involvement index of 0). The dependent variable was participants’ scores on their immediate and delayed posttests (i.e. the number of words they remembered in the respective posttests).

Data gathered were entered into SPSS version 25 for analysis using descriptive and parametric statistics. The data was analysed in two dimensions: the effects of the four treatments between subjects and within subjects. The former was to measure treatment effects between the four groups of participants throughout four experimental sessions, while the latter sought to measure treatment effects on each group of participants and examine whether the results were solely attributed to treatment effects rather than unexpected variables such as individual difference and experimental orders. Four separate one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) procedures were performed to examine between-group retention scores on immediate posttests and delayed posttests, respectively (i.e. four on immediate posttests and another four on delayed posttests). Second, within-subject vocabulary retention in the immediate and delayed posttests was analysed respectively using two separate one-way ANOVA repeated measures (one for immediate posttests, another for delayed posttests). The Bonferroni post hoc test $\left( p < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ was used for pairwise comparisons when ANOVA results showed a significant difference. The effect size (partial Eta squared) was calculated to estimate how much variance was accounted for by the treatments.

# Results

The first research question inquired about the extent to which viewing dual-subtitled videos under four different ILH-based interventions stimulated immediate vocabulary gains, while the second research question asked about the extent to which vocabulary retention varied under different interventions.

# Between-group results

Overall, the descriptive statistics show that participants who received treatments with higher IL demonstrated better immediate vocabulary gains, and the trend was consistent throughout all four experimental sessions no

matter which group of participants was involved. This observation was supported by ANOVA results, which revealed a statistically significant high correlation between the dependent and independent variables.

# Results of Experimental Session 1

The results of Experimental Session 1 indicated that TA participants and TB participants demonstrated the highest and second-highest scores in immediate vocabulary gains respectively, followed by TC and TD participants (see Table 3). Results of a one-way ANOVA test of participants’ scores in their immediate posttest also revealed a highly significant treatment effect $( \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 6 8 ) = [ 1 4 9 . 8 9 7 ]$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ; $\eta \mathrm { p } 2 = 0 . 8 7 ,$ ). Post hoc Tukey’s analysis showed greater immediate vocabulary gains in treatments with higher IL compared to treatments with lower $\operatorname { I L } ,$ where TA participants had significantly higher mean scores than TB participants, and TB participants scored significantly higher than TC and TD participants. Results of the ANOVA test on participants’ retention scores in their delayed posttests indicated a significant treatment effect $( \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 6 8 ) = [ 1 0 5 . 3 6 ]$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta \mathrm { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 8 2 ,$ ). Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test revealed that the mean values of retention scores of all four groups were significantly different $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ .

# Results of Experimental Session 2

Means and standard deviations for Experimental Session 2 revealed the same tendency when different groups of participants took part in the treatments (see Table 4): Participants receiving TA demonstrated the highest mean score in both their immediate and delayed posttests, followed by those receiving TB. Both immediate vocabulary gains and vocabulary retention scores of TD participants were the lowest. The results were statistically significant in both the immediate posttest $( \operatorname { F } ( 3 , 6 8 ) = [ 2 0 9 . 0 3 7 ]$ , $\textstyle P \ < \ . 0 0 1$ ; $\displaystyle { \boldsymbol { \eta } } { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { p } } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 8 5 ,$ ) and delayed posttest $( \operatorname { F } ( 3 , 6 8 ) = [ 5 9 . 9 2 ]$ , $\textit { p } < \ . 0 0 1$ , $\eta \mathrm { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 7 1 $ ), and post hoc analysis confirmed the differences.

ANOVA indicated a significant difference in the mean scores in immediate vocabulary gains among all four groups of participants in both their immediate posttests (Session 3: $\mathrm { F } = 1 4 5 . 2 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta \mathrm { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 8 7$ ; Session 4: $\mathrm { F } = 1 6 7 . 8 3 8$ ; $\textit { p } < \ . 0 0 1$ ; $\eta \mathrm { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 8 8 ,$ ) and delayed posttests (Session 3: $\mathrm { F } = 1 0 2 . 1 4 4$ ; $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta \mathrm { p } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 8 1$ ; Session 4 $: \mathrm { F } = 1 7 6 . 8 6 2$ ; $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta \mathrm { p } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 8 9 )$ .

In sum, each of the four experimental sessions consistently showed the same pattern regardless of the group of participants involved. Results from all immediate and delayed posttests showed significantly different levels of vocabulary gains and vocabulary retention among the four treatments, where all groups generally performed better when given treatments with higher IL (i.e. retention scores induced by $\mathrm { T A } { > } \mathrm { T B } { > } \mathrm { T C } { > } \mathrm { T D } )$ .

# Within-subjects results

# Immediate vocabulary gains

Descriptive statistics of the immediate posttest within the same groups of participants revealed that, on average, the greatest number of words were correctly recalled in TA $\mathrm { ' m e a n } = 9 . 0 5$ ; $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 0 . 8 7 \rangle$ , followed by TB $( \mathrm { m e a n } \ = \ 7 . 1 5 ; \ \mathrm { S D } \ = \ 1 . 2 3 )$ and TC (mean $= ~ 4 . 7 0$ ; SD $= ~ 1 . 4 1 $ ), while the fewest were recalled from TD (mean $= ~ 1 . 0 1$ ; SD $= 1 . 1 6 )$ . Statistical difference between the treatments was assessed by a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Mauchly’s test of sphericity was not violated, and sphericity was assumed $( \chi 2 ( 2 ) = 1 0 . 3 4$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 7 \mathrm { , }$ ), so no adjustments for the final ANOVA were needed. The ANOVA results showed that there was a significant treatment effect on the average number of words participants successfully remembered (F(3, $2 1 3 ) { = } 6 1 7 . 0 0$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\displaystyle \boldsymbol { \eta } \boldsymbol { \rho } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 0 )$ ), and Bonferroni post hoc tests revealed TA differed significantly from all other treatments (all ${ p < 0 . 0 0 1 ) }$ .

# Vocabulary retention

A consistent trend was observed in the delayed posttest results. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that participants’ vocabulary retention scores in their delayed posttests differed significantly across the four treatments (F(3, $2 1 3 ) { = } 4 5 2 . 1 6$ , $\mathit { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta \mathrm { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 8 6 )$ . Participants exhibited the highest level of retention in TA (mean $= 7 . 9 4$ ; $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 4 3 )$ and TB $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 5 . 5 1 $ ; SD $= 1 . 3 5 )$ , followed by TC (mean $= 3 . 1 8$ ; $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 4 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ), and the lowest in TD (mean $= 0 . 5 2$ ; $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 8 8  $ ). Mauchly’s test $\langle \chi 2 ( 2 ) { = } 3 . 8 2$ , $p { = } 0 . 5 7 ,$ ) did not indicate any violation of sphericity.

# Discussion

Overall, the findings of this study showed that viewing dual-subtitled videos under different ILH-based instructional interventions rendered different outcomes concerning vocabulary gains.11 Between-subject results over four experimental sessions as well as within-subject results indicated that the strongest level of vocabulary gains of the target words was found among low-intermediate learners of English who viewed dual-subtitled videos under treatments with an involvement index of 4 (TA). A moderate level of vocabulary gains was found in those who took part in treatments with an involvement index of 3 (TB) and an involvement index of 2 (TC). Vocabulary gains were low in treatments with an involvement index of 0 (TD). This trend was true for both immediate vocabulary gains and vocabulary retention. Scrutiny of the pooled data shows that TA and TB yielded a relatively satisfying level of immediate vocabulary gains $\mathrm { \tiny ~ A } = 9 1 \%$ ; $\mathrm { B } = 7 2 \%$ ) and vocabulary retention $( \mathrm { A } = 7 5 \%$ ; $\mathrm { B } = 5 5 \%$ ) than TC (immediate $= ~ 4 7 \%$ ; delayed $= 3 2 \%$ ). A notable rate of decline was observed in immediate vocabulary gains $( 1 0 \% )$ and vocabulary retention $( 5 \% )$ yielded by TD.

A plausible explanation could be established by revisiting the difference between the four treatments in this study, as illustrated in Table 2. TA differed from TB in that the former required stronger evaluation due to

L2 output in learners’ context (composition), while the latter required only moderate evaluation as learners were only exposed to L2 input (gap-filling). The superiority of TA over TB in yielding immediate vocabulary gains and subsequent retention might be attributed to the different degrees of evaluation involved. Meanwhile, the fact that fewer than half of the target words were retained in both immediate and delayed posttests for TC could be attributed to the absence of evaluation. This suggests that the component evaluation may have a determinant effect on participants’ retention of the target words. In general, such results corroborate previous findings in the ILH literature that learning conditions associated with more greater involvement loads could lead to greater vocabulary gains (e.g. Hulstijn and Laufer 2001; Keating, 2008; Kim, 2008; Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001).

The consistently low retention rate found in both immediate and delayed posttests of TD participants suggests that viewing dual-subtitled videos alone (i.e. no need, search and evaluation imposed through interventions) may not be as conducive to vocabulary learning as viewing activities with interventions like the other three treatments. This may be evident from a verifying procedure in TD that shows none of the participants indicated any self-imposed need to recall or check up on unfamiliar or challenging vocabulary from the videos presented. The fact that TD was less effective than the other three tasks also supports findings in recent scholarship that viewing subtitled videos with pre-viewing instructional interventions could enhance vocabulary learning (e.g. Gesa & Miralpeix, 2022; Montero Perez, 2019; Munoz, 2019; Teng, 2022), but the present study provides additional evidence on the different outcomes between watching subtitled videos without interventions (TD) and viewing subtitled videos with three different types of pre-viewing interventions (TA to TC). It is also the first study that offers insights into how pre-viewing interventions for dual-subtitled video viewing may be built on the ILH theoretical framework to foster vocabulary gains. However, some caveats should be noted when interpreting the findings of TD. First, since repetitions have a greater impact on meaning recall (Peters & Webb, 2018), the observed low contribution of TD can potentially be associated to the involvement of a single episode, as compared to the repeated attention directed to the target words in TA, TB, and TC with the presence of pre-viewing interventions. Second, whether TD has contributed to any vocabulary gains or any longitudinal impacts on participants’ vocabulary gains beyond the target vocabulary remains inconclusive and is beyond the scope of this study.

In summary, the results of the present study are significant in at least two major respects. First, the findings add evidence to the positive impacts of dual subtitles on vocabulary learning in an intentional learning setting, which has so far received very little attention in relevant works (e.g. Wang, 2019; Wang & Pellicer‐Sánchez, 2022). The findings of the present study suggest that the bilingual dual coding theory (Paivio, 2014) may hold true in the case of quadruple associations between visual input and three distinct sets of verbal input (L2 audio, L1 subtitles and L2 captions). Moreover, the findings support the ‘subtitle principle’, which postulates that subtitles may not be redundant information in the way that the redundancy principle normally predicts and support the contention that the reverse redundancy theory holds true in the context of L2 learning (Mayer et  al., 2020). The finding fills the literature gap and adds new insights to the subtitle principle by suggesting that the coverage of the principle (Mayer et  al., 2020) may be extended from multimodal input with single subtitles (i.e. audio $^ +$ visuals $+ \mathrm { L } 1 / \mathrm { L } 2$ subtitles) to multimodal input with dual subtitles (i.e. audio $\pm { \mathrm { \ v i s u a l s } } +$ L1 + L2 subtitles).

Second, unlike previous works which primarily aimed at comparing the outcomes of viewing videos with dual subtitles versus other types of subtitles/captions, this study is the first to compare the effectiveness of viewing dual-subtitled videos under four different types of learning conditions. An implication of the findings is that the benefits of dual subtitles for vocabulary learning (like those in existing literature) may not be solely attributed to the presence of such on-screen texts but can be heavily dependent on learning conditions such as the presence or type of interventions involved. Such results are in line with recent studies indicating that a combination of captioned videos and instructional interventions can enhance vocabulary learning (e.g. Gesa & Miralpeix, 2022; Montero Perez, 2019; Teng, 2022a), but this study offers fresh insights into how instructional interventions for viewing activities may be approached and operationalised from an ILH perspective. Moreover, this study offers specific evidence for the outcomes of dual-subtitled videos and ILH-based interventions in this respect, and instructional interventions adopted in the study varied from pre-viewing, post-viewing, or a combination of both. The findings that dual-subtitled videos could lead to significantly higher vocabulary learning gains when accompanied by interventions of higher involvement loads should make an innovative contribution to the field of audiovisual input for L2 learning. In particular, the findings offer empirical evidence to the ILH (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001) in the context of audiovisual materials, suggesting that need, search, and evaluation may be significant determinants of vocabulary gains where dual-subtitled videos are concerned.

Several pedagogical implications may also be gleaned from the findings. First, this study delineated how computer-assisted or web-based learning tools such as the Language Reactor and Vocabprofile on the Compleat Lexical Tutor website (Cobb, 2021) may be exploited to assist judicious selection of target words and preparation of dual-subtitled videos. Second, this study provides an ILH-based framework for viewing activities (operationalised as four treatments) in a multimedia environment and shows how interventions that can induce stronger need, search and evaluation may be operationalised to bolster vocabulary learning in the context of audiovisual input.

# Limitations

This study has its limitations. First, it concerns only low-intermediate learners of English, and hence the findings may not be generalised to other educational contexts or learners of other proficiency levels. Second, word retention was only measured by a delayed posttest administered one week after the corresponding treatments due to time constraints in course arrangement. Third, participants’ success levels in the writing and gap-filling activities12 were not analysed or reported in this study, but future studies may benefit from comparing the correlations between participants’ success levels in the treatments and their performance in corresponding posttests. Moreover, although the four interventions examined in this study were designed, operationalised and interpreted based on distinction in the degree of involvement loads, they were considered comparable to an intentional learning condition13 in the sense that participants were informed of the upcoming vocabulary posttests, with specific reference to the distinction by Eysenck (1982). Given the scope of inquiry, the present study has not attempted to investigate the results from the perspectives of intentional/ incidental learning conditions, nor has the experimental design been established to serve this purpose. However, this is an area that should be discussed in future work. Future researchers may also investigate the outcomes that may arise in incidental learning conditions.

# Conclusion and future directions

This study investigated two underexplored areas in the literature on audiovisual input for vocabulary learning. It was found that dual-subtitled viewing could foster vocabulary learning. However, the impact of dual-subtitled video viewing activities with higher involvement load (IL) was far more pronounced than dual-subtitled video viewing activities with lower IL. This suggests that the ILH theoretical framework (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001) holds in the context of L2 learning through audiovisual input. Several contributions have been made to the growing area of research into the benefits of captioned audiovisual materials for language learning (e.g. Montero Perez, 2022). First, consistent with the scarce literature on the effects of dual subtitles (e.g. Dizon & Thanyawatpokin,

2021), this research suggests that viewing dual-subtitled videos can facilitate L2 vocabulary learning, but that vocabulary gains can be conditional upon the degree of IL such as need, search and evaluation invested in processing target vocabulary. Secondly, the present study has demonstrated how the potential of captioned audiovisual materials can be fruitfully augmented when integrated with ILH-based interventions. In addition to enriching the literature on the ILH (e.g. Kim, 2008; Pichette et  al., 2012) and providing rare evidence for the role of involvement loads in yielding vocabulary gains within an intentional learning setting, the present study may inspire future scholarship on ILH-based inquiry (e.g. Hulstijn & Laufer, 2001) in the context of audiovisual multimedia learning or other sub-domains in relation to Computer-Assisted Language Learning.

Future studies may hopefully explore how the ILH may interact with other captioning conditions such as glossed captions or how ILH-based instructional interventions can be operationalised to enable learners to benefit from captioned/subtitled videos or other forms of multimedia learning outside EFL classrooms. Researchers may also consider comparing the longitudinal impacts on retention brought by viewing dual-subtitled videos with interventions versus without interventions or extending the present study to observations of other variables that may have given rise to the outcomes, such as observing participants’ look-up behaviours in different treatments using eye-tracking techniques, since they may operate as an additional layer or alternative construct beyond the ILH established by Laufer and Hulstijn (2001). With increasing accessibility to diverse audiovisual materials and advanced captioning/subtitling resources, the question that arises is how they may be optimised for L2 learning.

# Notes

1. In this study, L2 refers to learners’ foreign language, while L1 refers to the native language.   
2. In this study, ‘instructional interventions’ refer to theoretically driven and empirically supported pedagogical activities and are used interchangeably with ‘interventions’ and ‘experimental conditions’.   
3. In this study, audiovisual input and audiovisual materials are used interchangeably.   
4. For simplicity, in this study, the term captioned videos are used as a general term to refer to videos with subtitles/captions, while dual-subtitled videos are used to refer to videos with dual subtitles.   
5. Netflix is a globally popular digital streaming service provider that offers a wide range of TV series, films and documentaries on an internet-connected device.   
6. In this study, a slow-paced narrated video is one that contains no more than 141 words per minute. This is in to serve in contrast to what Mayer et  al. (2014) defined as a fast-paced video (142 words or more per minute), which may result in working memory overload.   
7. This procedure was not a pretest for the participants but simply a procedure administered before the experiment proper to verify whether the target words were

all unknown to the participants (as the research outcomes can be greatly affected if the participants already know the target words).

8. During the pilot test, some participants allegedly indicated their prior knowledge or mistakenly reported knowing words they actually did not know. One indicated knowing ‘trafficking’ but actually took it as ‘traffic’, while another indicated knowing the word ‘overthrow’ based on his familiarity with the prefix and mistakenly interpreted it as ‘throwing too much’. Hence, this verification step (i.e., proving participants really know the word rather than just indicating so) was considered necessary when finalising the instruments (i.e., target words) for the main study.   
9. The four treatments and their immediate posttests were administered on weeks 1, 3, 5 and 7, while the corresponding delayed posttests were administered on weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 (i.e., subsequent weeks).   
10. According to Eysenck (1982), an experimental vocabulary learning condition is distinguished as intentional (as opposed to incidental) based on whether learners are given pre-learning instructions that forewarn them about a follow-up vocabulary retention test. Based on such operational terms, the treatments adopted in this study are considered comparable to an intentional learning condition, although the entire study has been approached from an ILH perspective (see ‘limitation’).   
11. Vocabulary gains in this study refer to both immediate vocabulary gains and vocabulary retention.   
12. Although data analysis of these activities was beyond the scope of this study, they were evaluated by the same researcher and returned to learners upon completion of the entire study for general L2 learning purposes (see limitations).   
13. This differentiation is also in line with Hulstijn (2001, p.268), who defined intentional vocabulary learning as ‘any activity aiming at committing lexical information to memory’ and incidental vocabulary learning as ‘the by-product of any activity not explicitly geared to vocabulary learning’.
