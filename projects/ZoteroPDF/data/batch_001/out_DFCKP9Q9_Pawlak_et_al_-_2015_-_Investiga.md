# Abstract

Recent years have witnessed a shift in empirical investigations of language learners’ willingness to communicate (WTC) from quantitative studies examining the ways in which WTC antecedents co-act and contribute to communication, treating the concept as a stable characteristic, to a mixed-methods approach that allows the examination of stable behavioral tendencies and dynamic changes brought about by contextual variables. The rationale behind this study comes from the assumption that more profound understanding of motives underlying learners’ readiness or reluctance to speak may help create classroom conditions that facilitate communication, thus contributing to linguistic attainment. More specifically, the study represents an attempt to tap factors that shape advanced learners’ WTC during conversation classes in four different groups of students. Each time, the data were collected by means of self-ratings (i.e. indications of the level of WTC on a scale from $- 1 0 \ \mathsf { t o } + 1 0 )$ and immediate reports (i.e. questionnaires including closed and open-ended items). A combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed that the extent to which WTC fluctuated was impacted by a range of contextual and individual factors. It was enhanced in particular when students were given the opportunity to communicate with familiar receivers in small groups or pairs on topics related to personal experiences.

# I Introduction

Although the body of research into willingness to communicate (WTC) has greatly expanded in recent years (for overviews, see, for example, Peng, 2014; Yashima, 2012), most of the studies have focused on identifying the antecedents of WTC and exploring the relationships between them with a view to proposing a valid model of the concept. Thus, such studies have embraced what could be labeled a ‘macro-perspective’, in which large amounts of data are collected by means of validated data collection instruments from large numbers of participants, and an attempt is made to offer generalizations. The merits of this approach notwithstanding, what is equally, or potentially even more, insightful, is a ‘micro-perspective’ on WTC, which strives to offer insights into the nature, magnitude and influences on learners’ readiness to start or contribute to interaction in a specific context, such as a concrete activity, an entire class or a sequence of classes. After all, it is possible to provide a finer-grained, multifaceted and situated picture of these issues, also taking account of the dynamic nature of WTC, much in the same vein as has been accomplished in the case of language learning motivation (Dörnyei, MacIntyre, & Henry, 2014; Pawlak, 2012; Pawlak, Mystkowska-Wiertelak, & Bielak, 2014). Building upon previous research undertaken by the present authors (MystkowskaWiertelak & Pawlak, 2014; Pawlak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2015), this article presents the results of a study that sought to tap into changes in the level of WTC and their causes during regularly-scheduled classes taught to advanced learners of English.

# II Literature review

The study of WTC originated within the field of communication studies and originally involved factors that hindered communication. At first, it was unwillingness to communicate (Burgoon, 1976) and shyness (McCroskey & Richmond, 1982) as well as predispositions toward verbal behavior (Mortensen, Arnston, & Lustig, 1977) that captured researchers’ attention. Soon the inquiry into a person’s readiness to enter communication extended beyond the boundaries of exchanges in one’s first language (L1), which marked the onset of empirical investigations of factors leading to second language (L2) learners’ willingness to initiate or contribute to communication when given the choice. Since WTC was operationalized as a personality-based, cognitively-mediated variable (McCroskey & Richmond, 1987, 1992), numerous attempts at identifying factors responsible for variation in the degree of WTC were undertaken. Early studies of L2 WTC involved performing statistical analyses of the relationships between a learner’s readiness to engage in communication and multiple individual variables believed to affect language learning (e.g. MacIntyre & Charos, 1996; MacIntyre & Clément, 1996). This led to the conceptualization of L2 WTC as a construct immediately preceding language use within a pyramid model proposed by MacIntyre, Clément, Dörnyei and Noels (1998), which captured both trait and state characteristics, intergroup communication processes and temporal issues. The model has inspired numerous studies that attempted either its validation or identification of other variables that might affect readiness to initiate speech.

Soon the need to account for situational and dynamic aspects of WTC was recognized, which resulted in applying a mixed-methods approach (see Cao & Philip, 2006;

MacIntyre & Legatto, 2011) and allowed looking into stable tendencies and dynamic shifts triggered by contextual variables. In effect, the original instrumentation applied in WTC studies, including scales and their adaptations, has been supplemented with qualitative tools, such as observations, immediate recall, stimulated recall, self-report, or learning journals, thanks to which a finer-grained lens could be applied to both individual and contextual influences. Due to space constraints, out of the wealth of studies investigating situational variables shaping learners’ WTC in a range of cultural contexts, only the most representative will be outlined here. Their choice has been dictated by the authors’ interest in exploring and identifying factors pertinent to WTC fluctuations within a classroom context and driven by the belief that applying a micro-perspective, where intervening influences are well defined and described, might enable offering feasible pedagogical solutions.

One of the early attempts at pinpointing the situational variables that affect L2 WTC in a communicative situation was the study by Kang (2005), who found that the decision to initiate or contribute to communication resulted from an interplay of three psychological variables, that is security, excitement, and responsibility. Cao and Philip (2006), in turn, examined correlations between trait WTC and actual communicative behavior in three interactional situations: pair work, group work and whole class. Data collected by means of a WTC questionnaire were juxtaposed against information obtained through classroom observations, audio-recordings of group and pair work as well as interviews with each of the participants. The findings demonstrated that situational WTC is a function of group size, familiarity with interlocutors, their participation, knowledge of the topic, self-confidence and cultural background, but no correlations between trait and situational WTC were observed.

More recently, a more detailed perspective was applied by Cao (2011), who conducted a multiple case study of situational WTC using classroom observations, stimulated-recall and reflective journals in which information concerning participants’ in-class and out-of-class WTC was recorded. In this case, WTC was operationalized as instances of voluntary communication during a lesson rather than an intention to speak. The analysis showed that situational WTC stems from an interplay of individual variables, such as self-confidence, personality, emotion or perceived opportunity to communicate, environmental influences, including topic, task, interlocutor, teacher and group size, as well as linguistic factors. In a longitudinal case study, Cao (2013) demonstrated that WTC fluctuates within a single task, lesson and sequence of lessons, an outcome which was attributed to growing experience and confidence. In her latest study, Cao (2014) provided evidence for a dynamic rather than stable character of classroom WTC in the data collected by means of classroom observations, stimulated-recall interviews, and reflective journals. The findings suggest that individual characteristics, classroom environmental conditions, and linguistic factors interact in leading to ebbs and flows in WTC. It is evident, however, that such predictions can hardly be generalized given the individual character of the interplay of various influences in particular students.

Another glimpse at factors that shape classroom WTC was offered by De Saint Léger and Storch (2009), who explored the ways in which students’ perceptions of their speaking skills, contributions they made to in-class oral activities, and attitudes towards these activities affected their WTC. Detailed analyses of the data led to the conclusion that such perceptions indeed contribute to shaping WTC levels. Yet another step in the search for variables that facilitate or inhibit learners’ WTC was taken by MacIntyre, Burns, and Jessome (2011), who employed a focused essay technique. They showed that learners experience a great deal of ambivalence with reference to their desire to engage in interaction, and they can at the same time be both willing and unwilling to communicate, under certain circumstances, with a subtle change of context having the potential to turn willingness into avoidance. Adopting a dynamic systems perspective (Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2008), MacIntyre and Legatto (2011) developed what they labeled an idiodynamic method of measuring moment-by-moment fluctuations in WTC during task performance, which enables not only registering changes in its levels over a short period of time, but also tapping the feelings or motives underlying these changes. As the results indicated, the observed variation could mainly be ascribed to difficulty in finding suitable lexis, with the caveat that vocabulary would have been less relevant had the learners been more familiar with the context and more proficient.

The present authors (Mystkowska-Wiertelak & Pawlak, 2014) have departed from a laboratory-style procedure adopted by MacIntyre and Legatto (2011), situating their enquiry in the language classroom. English majors, performing two communication tasks that were typical of this instructional context, were requested to mark on a scale from $^ { - 1 0 }$ to $+ 1 0$ the levels of their WTC at regular time intervals on hearing a beep, with a view to detecting differences between dialogues (pair work) and monologues (presentation). It was found that the latter were more conducive to enhancing WTC, but also that readiness to speak diminished as participants grew weary of the task, irrespective of its type. Self-ratings were also used by Pawlak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2015) in a study conducted among advanced learners of English whose WTC was measured during a discussion in pairs. Having completed the task, the respondents listened to audiorecordings of their interactions and were asked to comment on the most conspicuous changes of their WTC, identifying a constellation of factors responsible for such fluctuations, such as presence or absence of the teacher, degree of familiarity with the interlocutor or simply having ideas to share.

Peng (2014), in turn, complemented her large-scale quantitative enquiry of language learners’ WTC in China with an ecologically-nested multiple case study in which participants repeatedly took part in semi-structured interviews and kept a learning journal. The researcher observed the participants in a series of classes and reported instances of volunteering answers to the teacher’s questions, taking part in a role play, nonpublic response, response in chorus, initiating questions to other students or the teacher, answering questions asked by classmates, initiating informal conversation with the teacher and responding to the teacher informally. This situated approach enabled Peng (2014) to look at WTC from a perspective that takes into account cultural and contextual issues that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. The analysis of the data showed that classroom WTC embraces five forms of readiness to contribute to communication, that is cognitive, linguistic, affective, motivational and cultural readiness. Learners’ own appraisal of their competence depends on the amount of cognitive knowledge and linguistic means they have at their disposal but deficits in the other constituents may have an equally detrimental effect on their wish to communicate.

In most of the studies reported above, an immediate context-dependent perspective of L2 learners’ WTC has been adopted with a view to, first, identifying conditions triggering a rise or fall in WTC, and, second, establishing tendencies underlying an intricate interplay between such factors (for a summary of the main influences on changes in WTC levels identified by researchers, see Table 1). The study presented below aims at providing yet another piece of this intricate puzzle by looking into variables affecting fluctuations in WTC levels in the course of regular conversation classes taught to English majors. Its main advantage in comparison to previous research is that it attempts to capture increases and decreases in learners’ willingness to speak at regular intervals, thereby offering a much more sensitive measure in this respect than those employed to date.

# III The study

# Aims and research questions

The study aimed to explore the dynamic character of WTC of advanced learners of English during regularly-scheduled speaking classes which constituted an integral part of a comprehensive foreign language course. Thus, in contrast to other research projects seeking to investigate moment-by-moment fluctuations in learners’ WTC conducted under experimental conditions (e.g. MacIntyre & Legatto, 2011), and similarly to the studies undertaken by Cao (2013, 2014), the present study attempted to ensure high ecological validity (see Peng, 2014). This is because it tapped into changes in WTC in a real classroom, with all of its diverse realities, exigencies and influences, thereby enhancing the relevance of the findings to real-life foreign language instruction. More specifically, it sought to address the following research questions:

What is the extent of changes in the learners’ WTC in the course of speaking classes?   
Are there any typical patterns in fluctuations of learners’ WTC over a single class, taking as a point of reference factors identified in the literature (see Table 1) as well as other variables which are of pedagogic relevance to classroom interaction (related to the teacher, students, instructional activities, group dynamics, etc.)? Which contextual and individual factors lead to an increase and decrease in WTC in the course of a single class?

# 2 Participants

The participants were 60 Polish university students, 41 female and 19 male, who were majoring in English and were enrolled in year 1 or 2 of a BA program, divided into 4 intact groups (henceforth Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4). On average, they were 20.5 years of age and their mean experience in learning English as a foreign language amounted to 11.47 years. Their overall level of proficiency oscillated between B1 and B2 according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, with the caveat that proficiency was varied, not only with respect to the level in the program but also the students in the same year and the mastery of different skills and subsystems. When requested to self-evaluate their ability, they ranked their overall mastery of English at 3.77 $\left. S D = 0 . 5 3 \right)$ on a scale from 2 (lowest) to 5 (highest), which is typically used for assessment at Polish institutions of higher education. As regards speaking, which is of particular relevance to the focus of the reported study, participants self-evaluated it as 3.38 $\mathbf { \xi } \mathbf { S } D = 0 . 5 9$ ) on the same scale, which indicates that they themselves see considerable room for improvement. As is typically the case with regular programs in foreign language departments, participants had the benefit of attending an intensive course in English as a foreign language, which included classes in pronunciation, grammar, speaking, writing and integrated skills, as well as content courses in linguistics, literature, history, culture, language teaching methodology, and social sciences, most of which were taught in the target language. The classes analyzed for the purpose of the study were conducted by four experienced teachers, all of whom always took time to carefully prepare them and did their best to make sure that the students had numerous opportunities to engage in communication.

# 3 Data collection and analysis

The data for the present study were collected during four regularly-scheduled intact speaking classes taught to English majors in the first and second year of the BA program.

This involved the use of: (1) a grid with participants’ self-ratings of their readiness to make a contribution to ongoing interaction, filled out as a particular class was in progress, (2) questionnaires that were completed towards the end of each class, and (3) detailed lesson plans supplied by each of the teachers who had consented to take part in the research project, together with comments on their implementation.

During each class the students were requested to rate their WTC every 5 minutes in response to a prerecorded beep on a grid including a scale from $- 1 0$ to $+ 1 0$ , where the two extremes indicated total unwillingness and total willingness to communicate, respectively. The instructions were in Polish and their translation was as follows ‘On hearing a beep, please indicate how willing or unwilling you feel to speak.’ A similar instrument has been successfully used in previous studies investigating the dynamics of WTC (Pawlak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2015), motivation (Pawlak, 2012; Pawlak et al., 2014) or the self (Mercer, 2014). Moreover, the participants were asked to provide such information as the year in the program, group number and the date of the class. Even though the classes were scheduled to last 90 minutes each, the students were required to mark their level of WTC only 13 times over the period of 60 minutes as various speaking activities and tasks were being performed, with the starting and ending point for this procedure being different for different classes. This was because the classes seldom started and finished on time, the beginning and end were often dedicated to procedural issues, and sometimes short tests were included, with the effect that taking into account the whole 90-minute span would have rendered any between-class comparisons difficult, if not impossible. The questionnaire was designed with a view to gaining insights into the nature of WTC as well as the factors that impacted it in the course of a particular class, it was worded in Polish, and it contained both closed- and open-ended questions. The questions concerned such issues as the general level of WTC, variables that may have contributed to its increase or decrease, including the mode of classroom organization, the interlocutor, his or her level of proficiency, the tasks being performed, as well as the topics covered. The respondents were also invited to enumerate other factors that they believed were important in this respect and to briefly describe an event, situation, task at hand or stage of the class when they felt the most and the least willing to speak. The final source of data were detailed lesson plans, where, apart from a short description of the consecutive activities, the teachers included comments on what exactly was happening and what the students were doing as the beeps were emitted. Due to space limitations as well as the fact that the most in-depth and reliable data were available in this case, the analysis presented below focuses on fluctuations in WTC during only one class, taught by one of the authors, and thus only this lesson plan was taken into consideration. Generally speaking, the class was devoted to discussing the media and comprised a series of speaking tasks performed in pairs and small groups, followed by whole-class feedback sessions and aided by the use of printed and audiovisual materials. As in the case of the remaining classes, students expressed their consent to participate in the study and were assured that their performance would not affect their final grades.

The data gathered in these ways were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis, depending on their nature. The former was primarily applied in the case of the grid in which participants were required to record changes in their WTC, and involved tabulating the means and $S D s$ for each instance that the level of WTC was indicated (i.e.

every 5 minutes), as well as for students’ overall readiness to interact in a particular class. Numerical procedures were also used when analysing responses to some of the questions in the post-hoc questionnaires, in particular, to establish the percentages of students reporting whether the factors listed contributed to an increase or decrease in their WTC.1 Qualitative analysis entailed identifying and categorizing recurring themes in responses to the open-ended items and the interpretation of the ups and downs in WTC in terms of the lessons plan and teacher’s indications of what transpired at a particular point in time.

# IV Results

A substantial amount of variation was observed across groups, within groups and within individuals. The following subsections present the data related to such variation.

# 1 Variation across groups

Table 2 presents the means and SDs for each of the instances when the level of WTC was reported in each of the four groups as well as the overall mean and $S D$ values for a particular class, while Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of these numerical data. There were considerable differences between the four classes, both with respect to the mean level of the students’ WTC, ranging from 1.72 (Group 2) to 5.29 (Group 4), and the degree of dispersion in this respect, as is evident in the value of $S D$ in the range of 0.43 (Group 1) and 2.32 (Group 3). There were also considerable fluctuations in the participants’ WTC during the classes, which were the most pronounced in Group 3, where the only cases of unwillingness to interact were recorded (a difference of 7.26 between Time 1 and Times 12 and 13), followed by Group 2 (a difference of 4.07 between Time 3 and Time 5), Group 4 (a difference of 3.67 between Time 4 and Time 12), and Group 1 (a difference of 1.33 between Times 7 and 8, and Time 13). There also were considerable differences in the extent of individual variation at some points in time when the level of WTC was indicated, the most striking instances of this kind being observed in Group 3, where the values of $S D$ sometimes exceeded 6.00 (Times 1, 2 and 3). By contrast, the participants turned out to be the most unanimous in their self-ratings in Group 1, in which case the highest value of $S D$ amounted to 3.14 (Time 1) and was on the whole lower than 2.00.

# 2 Variation over time, within Group 1

As mentioned above, detailed analysis of the fluctuations in the level of WTC as well as the factors responsible for these fluctuations is confined to one class, taught to Group 1, by one of the authors. The ups and downs in the participants’ readiness to initiate or contribute to the interaction are illustrated in Figure 2, which includes a plot based on the students’ self-ratings, reflecting both means and standard deviations, together with brief descriptions of the tasks being performed at the times the level of WTC was indicated, as specified in the lesson plan, accompanied by the teacher’s comments. For the sake of clarity, it seems necessary here to reiterate some of the observations that were already made when presenting and synthesizing the data from Table 2, that is: (1) the average level of reported WTC amounted to 5.23 on a scale from $- 1 0$ to $+ 1 0$ , which testifies to the students’ readiness to participate in the conversation class, (2) the fluctuations in the students’ readiness to speak indicated at 5-minute intervals were rather small and never exceeded 1.33, and (3) there was relatively little individual variation in this respect, both when it comes to the 13 occasions when the level of WTC was marked, with the highest $S D$ value of 3.14, and the whole class, as evident in the $S D$ value of 0.43.

Figure 2. Fluctuations in the level of willingness to communicate in Group 1 together with activities being performed. Notes. Points 1–13 represent the beeps; T stands for task being performed.

Following a discussion of procedural issues and a brief test, the students began selfrating their WTC after about 20 minutes, when the first speaking activities were commenced (see Figure 2). The participants’ readiness to speak began to rise gradually when they became engaged in such tasks, which, in the first 15 minutes (Beeps 1, 2 and 3), included a warm-up activity about the potential sources of news, performed in pairs (T1), and a decision-making activity dealing with the choice of leading stories for a news program, this time in small groups (T2). In each case, there was a feedback session on completion of the task during which selected students were asked to present their opinions and decisions in front of the class. It should also be added that Beep 1 occurred during the teacher-student exchanges following T1, Beep 2 was sounded as T2 was in progress, and Beep 3 was heard during the feedback session. What we can see here then is a pattern where the level of WTC is on the increase as students get more involved in speaking tasks, as the initial pair-work activity is replaced by group work, and as they get a chance to present and justify their decisions to others.

The next 25 minutes or so (Beeps 4 through 9) were dedicated to an activity in which the students were instructed to work in groups of four and prepare a news broadcast containing three news items. The items were supposed to be delivered to the rest of the class by three of the four group members, while the fourth was expected to act in the capacity of a guest invited to the program, a ‘hero’ of one of the news stories, who was to be briefly interviewed. This was followed by a whole-class feedback session during which students from different groups presented their news items and conducted the interviews. As the teacher commented, the students seemed to enjoy the activity, as evidenced by the production of some funny news items and entertaining interviews with the guests. The self-ratings of the WTC level were made during Beep 4, when participants were in the process of reading the instructions and the headlines, Beeps 5 through 7, which coincided with the preparation taking place in groups, and Beeps 8 and 9, when the news stories were being presented by different groups. As can be seen from Figure 2, there was a slight drop in the level of WTC from Beep 4 to Beep 5, followed by an increase at Beep 6, what could be described as leveling-off at Beeps 7 and 8, and another slight decrease at Beep 9. What this trend may indicate is that the participants’ WTC fell when the time allotted to task preparation was about to expire, it increased as they set about performing the task, and dropped again towards the end of the feedback session, which might perhaps signal a certain degree of weariness with the topic and task, with the caveat that all of these changes were evidently small.

The last part of the class during which the levels of WTC were indicated, approximately 20 minutes long, was devoted to performing a ‘Big Brother’ activity. This involved the teacher asking the students to say whether they had watched this reality TV show (most said no but mentioned more recent reality shows), watching a short, 5-minutelong video with some highlights from the American version of the program as an introduction to the task, and completing this task as a whole class. In the course of this activity, all the students got a small drawing of one of the people in the Big Brother picture and they were supposed to say why they should stay and who should go, preferably adding some information to the data included in the role card. As the teacher commented, this activity was a little rushed because the end of the class was approaching, with the effect that most students just repeated or even half-read what was printed in the role card. When it comes to the level of WTC indicated in the grid, Beep 10 was heard when the video was being presented, Beep 11 occurred immediately after the students were given the role cards, Beep 12 was sounded in the middle of the task when one student was talking, and, finally, Beep 13 was emitted when the task and in fact the entire class were drawing to a close. What could be observed during this time was an increase in WTC at the start of a new task, a fall towards the end of the video, which is not surprising given the fact that this did not call for active participation, an increase as the students started speaking, followed by a rather abrupt drop at the end of the task, which coincided with class termination.

The pattern that emerges here, in this group, is that the onset of a new activity, or perhaps a new stimulus, is likely to trigger a greater desire to speak, an activity which is primarily receptive in nature is bound to temper such readiness, the opportunity to express one’s own opinion contributes to enhancing it, and the imminent end of the class could trump all the other influences, exerting a visibly negative impact on the level of WTC. What cannot be overlooked though is the way in which the successive tasks were introduced and executed. While this can only remain a speculation in view of the lack of comparative data, it could be argued that had the teacher not used so many collaborative activities, allowed the students to voice their opinions and attached so much attention to the feedback sessions, this would have been reflected in the observed levels of WTC as well as fluctuations in this respect.

# 3 Variation over time, within Individuals

What is also worth considering is the reported communicative behavior of individual students in Group 1. As can be seen from Figure 3, which presents graphically the degree to which students were ready to engage in communication, the patterns for most of them are very similar, with the ups and downs occurring at almost the same time, and the differences in the level of WTC being in most cases minute. Two notable exceptions to this trend can be identified. First, it is worth noting that Students 6 and 7 were visibly more willing to participate than the others at Beep 5, a phenomenon which can perhaps be attributed to the inclusion of particularly engaging or entertaining arguments or ideas. This is because it happened during small-group discussions of news items and these two students did not on the whole stand out of the group with respect to their overall level of WTC. What also deserves a brief mention are the communicative behaviors of Students 1 and 12, mostly on account of the fact that their WTC levels indicated in the last 10 minutes differed quite dramatically. While in the case of the former there was a sharp decrease in the last task (Beep 12), followed by an abrupt increase immediately afterwards, Student 12 remained ready to speak towards the end of this activity, but then the WTC level plummeted. Whether such changes reflected different reactions to the approaching end of the class or should be ascribed to some other factors, however, can only be subject to speculation, given the lack of relevant data obtained directly from the participants, for instance by means of interviews or stimulated-recall sessions.

# 4 Students’ views of factors impacting WTC

Moving on to the responses to the items included in the questionnaires that were administered immediately before the end of the class in Group 1, students provided reasons for high or very high levels of WTC as well as those for why it was low, the former being by far more prevalent. In justification of their willingness to take part in speaking tasks, they made such comments as: ‘I enjoy speaking classes,’ ‘I like the topic,’ ‘The topic was interesting,’ ‘I had much to say,’ ‘I could talk about my personal experience’ or ‘I could express my opinions.’ By contrast, a low level of readiness to speak was explained by means of the following responses: ‘The class starts too early,’ ‘I had to get up at 6 in the morning,’ or ‘I am shy.’ When asked to indicate which of the factors listed in the survey (i.e. classroom arrangement mode, interlocutor, and his/her proficiency level) affected their WTC in a positive or negative way, students responded that all of them had a beneficial effect, albeit to a somewhat different degree. More specifically, they were of the opinion that their readiness to interact was the highest in small groups $( 9 4 . 4 4 \% )$ , followed by pairs $( 9 0 . 4 7 \% )$ ), and, evidently less so, when required to speak in front of the whole class $( 5 9 . 5 2 \% )$ . As for the impact of the interlocutor, it is clear that their WTC was the most likely to increase when they interacted with somebody they know well $( 9 2 . 8 5 \% )$ , much more so than in situations in which they were required to talk to a less familiar person $( 6 9 . 0 4 \% )$ or the teacher $( 5 9 . 5 2 \% )$ . The responses also indicated that their contribution to the ongoing interaction was enhanced the most when they had a chance to work with peers representing the same or similar proficiency level $( 9 5 \% )$ , while their desire to speak was markedly lower in the case of both less $( 6 6 \% )$ and more $( 6 1 \% )$ advanced interlocutors.

Some additional factors that can impinge on the level of WTC were also yielded by students’ responses to the open-ended items included in the survey. While increased readiness to speak was associated with such issues as an interesting topic, having ideas to share and good rapport with interlocutors, those which were likely to lower it included having to interact in a whole-class setting or simply not knowing what to say, either because of a lack of opinion or the inability to provide pertinent examples. The analysis of the comments also revealed that WTC was enhanced when the themes discussed were related to their personal experiences or interests, with respondents naming specific topics that both encouraged and discouraged interactions, a clear sign of individual preferences in this respect. As regards the impact of tasks, students pointed to the positive role of those performed in pairs and small groups, such that involved finding solutions and those for the completion of which they were given ample time to prepare, simultaneously indicating that their WTC decreased during whole-class exchanges, particularly when the teacher employed direct nomination. Finally, when asked to recall concrete situations in which they could observe a change in their desire to interact, they offered a number of examples. Apparently, they were the most willing to speak during game-like activities, when they came up with a good example or argument, or at the beginning or end of the class, whereas their WTC declined when someone said what they had intended to say or in the course of specific tasks focusing on one topic or another.

# V Discussion

What should be emphasized is that the study represents an approach to the investigation of the dynamic nature of WTC that can be considered innovative in some ways. This is because, first, fluctuations in this respect were traced over a sequence of activities and tasks performed over the course of classes taught to intact groups, and, second, a novel combination of data collection tools was used, in particular reliance on students’ selfratings made at specific time intervals. When it comes to the first research question, evident changes were observed in the level of the participants’ WTC during the four classes and the tasks completed in the course of these classes, which is in line with the findings of previous research (e.g. Cao & Philips, 2006; Cao, 2011, 2013, 2014; MacIntyre & Legatto, 2011; Mystkowska-Wiertelak & Pawlak, 2014; Pawlak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2015). These fluctuations, however, varied to a large extent from one class to another, both in terms of the magnitude of the readiness to take part in communication as well as the degree of variation, both for the class as a whole and at the times when the levels of WTC were reported. Since the present study did not aspire to attempt a detailed comparison of the classes, mainly for the reason that they were to a considerable degree incomparable due to the diversity of influences that shaped interactions taking place in each case, and the relevant data were not collected, it can only be speculated that the observed differences can be attributed to a wide array of factors. These included, for example, the topic, the types of tasks assigned and the ways in which they were implemented, the scheduling of the class, and teacher-related (e.g. personality, teaching style, teaching skills, enthusiasm, rapport with the students) as well as learnerrelated (e.g. motivation, proficiency, preparation, group dynamics) variables.

Moving on to the second research question, the analysis of the data demonstrated that it is difficult to identify any clear-cut patterns in the fluctuations of the level of WTC that would be common to the four classes (e.g. as the class progressed), not least because the starting points indicated by the students differed quite dramatically (from $- 2 . 1 3$ to 6.72), which to some extent determined subsequent ups and downs in the their readiness to enter into communication. More in this respect can be said about the class conducted in Group 1, which was subjected to careful scrutiny for the purpose of this study. In the first place, it can be assumed that the initially quite high self-reported WTC level left relatively little room for improvement, with the difference of a mere 1.08 between this and the highest recorded value, indicating that the ceiling effect could have come into play at some point. Secondly, it is clear that participants’ WTC remained rather stable throughout the class and, despite some momentary fluctuations, it dropped more visibly towards the end, but even then only slightly below its initial level. Thirdly, there was little individual variation with respect to the levels of WTC declared at 5-minute intervals and, what is more, with just a handful of exceptions, the overall pattern of the ebbs and flows in readiness to speak was very similar for all of the group members. Once again, however, whether these trends can be ascribed to the exceptional skill of the teacher, the topic being covered (i.e. the media), the tasks selected for this particular class, the characteristics of the students, their disposition on that specific day, or a combination of all of these is impossible to decide, not only because of insufficient data but also because of the fact that other speaking classes taught to this group were not the focus of investigation.

As regards the third research question, it can be addressed on the basis of two sources of data, namely, the juxtaposition of the students’ WTC ratings at 5-minute intervals with the lesson plan and the teacher’s comments, and the questionnaire responses made with reference to the specific class conducted in Group 1. At the outset, it should be emphasized that, as demonstrated by previous research (e.g. Cao, 2011; Cao & Philip, 2006; De Saint Léger & Storch, 2009; Kang, 2005; MacIntyre & Legatto, 2011; MystkowskaWiertelak & Pawlak, 2014; Pawlak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2015), the level of WTC proved to be a function of a number of contextual and individual variables, some of which were at times difficult to tease apart and, in line with the tenets of dynamic systems theories (see Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2006), entered into intricate, multi-level and unpredictable interactions with one another. In the first place, it is clear that the students’ readiness to speak hinged upon such factors as the stage of the class and its timing, the assigned task, the phase of that task, the way in which it was introduced and executed, the classroom arrangement mode, the specific topic, and the interlocutor. For example, as Figure 2 shows, some time was apparently needed before learners switched to what could be called ‘the speaking mode’, which should not come as a huge surprise in view of the fact that they use their mother tongue between classes, in some content classes and outside school, and that the class was scheduled early in the morning and was in fact the first participants attended on that day. Although Figure 2 might indicate that a reverse tendency could be at work towards the end of the class, with WTC levels falling considerably perhaps in anticipation of a break, such an interpretation is not obvious, as it is clear from Figure 3 that the drop in this class was mainly caused by a very low self-rating of one of the students. Undeniable, on the other hand, is the impact of task, topic and interlocutor, as WTC was visibly enhanced by the onset of a new activity and was diminished when boredom began to set in after it had been performed for some time. The students were also more eager to speak when the topic was interesting and it was related to their personal experiences, when they could think of ideas to share, or when they could express and justify their opinions, with the qualification that all of these influences were subject to individual variation, given the rather consistent pattern in WTC ratings. While, on the whole, pair and group work were more conducive to generating WTC, the latter presumably even more so than the former, than the whole-class setting, particularly when questions were directed at specific students, the impact of this factor was moderated by many other variables discussed here (e.g. the ability to express one’s ideas, group composition). There was also evidence that an increase in WTC could be expected when participants worked with individuals that they knew well and when the proficiency level of interlocutors was similar to their own. On the whole, it is interesting to point out that the patterns outlined here are reflective of these identified for the moment-by-moment changes in motivational intensity in studies investigating its dynamic nature (see Pawlak, 2012; Pawlak et al., 2014), an observation which is not unpredictable if we accept that WTC is very closely related to motivation.

Although the study undoubtedly sheds new light on the way in which WTC can fluctuate in the course of a regular class and points to variables that account for such changes, it also suffers from some weaknesses that need to be briefly addressed at this juncture. One of the potentially most important ones is the way in which the data on the ups and downs in the level of WTC were collected, as it could be argued that having to self-report something every 5 minutes is too disruptive and gets in the way of the task being performed, let alone the fact that participants might not have been candid in their indications. While such concerns cannot be ignored and have been acknowledged elsewhere (see Mystkowska-Wiertelak & Pawlak, 2014; Pawlak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2015), it is difficult to think of a more optimal and practicable way of tapping changes in WTC in a real classroom and the same methodology has been successfully applied in research on the dynamic nature of motivation or the self (see Pawlak, 2012; Pawlak et al., 2014; Mercer, 2014). Although the value of in-class observations, post-hoc interviews or stimulated-recall cannot be denied, they are not likely on their own to capture WTC at a particular point in time, mainly due to the multitude of learner-internal factors underlying it. In addition, they are not well-suited to take account of manifestations of private speech, which, according to sociocultural theory, can also be considered a form of communication and has been hypothesized to mediate language learning (see Ohta, 2011). It could also be argued that the class chosen for detailed analysis was not the most appropriate one for this purpose because WTC levels were high and the range of the changes was small, with the effect that it was difficult to pinpoint clear-cut patterns. Another limitation is the lack of data that would have allowed a more in-depth and less speculative interpretation of the fluctuations in WTC, in particular such related to the characteristics of the teachers, whose substantial impact on learners’ readiness to speak cannot be underestimated, and the students, whose personalities, learning styles, beliefs or learning histories also play a crucial role in this respect. A similar comment could be made about the failure to use data collection instruments that would have contributed to better understanding of the dynamism of WTC, such as in-class observations, post-class interviews, recordings or stimulated-recall sessions. A criticism could also be leveled at the fact that the data were not collected in the same group over the period of several classes. Had this been done, it would have become easier to attribute the changes in WTC to specific factors, such as the teacher, topic, task or the overall characteristics of the participants. Although the study would have without doubt benefited from considering such issues, it is never possible to take into account all variables, employ all the possible data collection tools or observe all the tendencies that might be interesting, not least on account of the logistical problem that can be encountered

In a sense, then, it seems that research on the dynamic nature of WTC has to be cumulative because it is the tendencies that emerge from a number of studies rather than a single study, no matter how meticulously designed or carried out, that are likely to enhance our understanding of the ebbs and flows in students’ readiness to speak as well as the factors bringing about such changes.

# VI Conclusions

The study reported here represents one of the few attempts to investigate the changes in the WTC levels in the course of regularly-scheduled classes, conducted in intact groups, thereby adopting a micro-perspective on learners’ readiness to speak. While it adds an important piece to the puzzle concerning the nature of WTC and the factors which are likely to increase as well as diminish it in a classroom setting, this is still only yet another small step on the path towards better understanding the complexity of this individual difference variable. It is thus necessary to undertake further research endeavors in this area, both such that adopt a macro-perspective, employ valid and reliable data collection tools and use data from hundreds of participants, and such that are more context-embedded, individual-sensitive and situated, such as the one reported here. As regards the latter type of studies, they should be undertaken in a wide array of instructional contexts, involve different types of learners (e.g. in terms of the educational level, age and proficiency), and take into consideration as broad a range of variables that may affect WTC as possible, not only those related to a particular context, but also teachers, learners, rapport between them or the nature of classroom interaction. Clearly, such research would need to be of the mixed-methods type, falling back on a wide variety of data collection tools, take place in real classrooms, and, as much as possible, be longitudinal in nature. Although setting so much store by WTC should by no means be interpreted as meaning that reluctance to communicate is necessarily a bad thing, not least because it may be reflective of individual learning styles, uncovering what conditions are the most conducive to stimulating interaction in the classroom is without doubt a pursuit worth undertaking, given the difficulties that many teachers encounter trying to get their learners to speak.

# Note

1. Given the research questions posed, we believe that the use of inferential statistics is not necessary. This is because we did not seek to show that there were statistically significant differences in WTC levels between the different groups or between the times when the beeps were emitted, not least because the groups were not really comparable (e.g. different teachers, topics, activities) and patterns in WTC fluctuations were more important than between-point comparisons. Rather, we wished to explore the extent of variation, identify typical patterns in this variation and tap into factors that are responsible for changes in WTC levels.
