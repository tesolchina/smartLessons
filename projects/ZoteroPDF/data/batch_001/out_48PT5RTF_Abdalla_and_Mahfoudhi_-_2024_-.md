# ABSTRACT

Verb morphology difficulties have been widely attested in children with developmental language disorder (DLD) who speak English and other languages. This research contributes data on a variety of Arabic, a richly inflected Semitic language. The current study examined the production of subject-verb agreement morphology in three groups of 30 monolingual Kuwaiti Arabicspeaking children. Ten preschoolers diagnosed with DLD $( M = 4 ; 4$ years) were compared to two groups of typically developing (TD) controls —10 languagematched (TD-LA) $W = 2 ; 7$ years) and 10 chronological age-matched (TD-CA) $( M = 4 ; 5$ years). To elicit target productions, an action video depicting a total of 33 randomly ordered third-person verb stimuli (12 feminine singular, 9 masculine singular, and 12 plurals) was presented. The results confirmed significant differences in the correct use of third-person verb (gender and number) agreement between the children with DLD and the two comparison groups. The DLD group was more proficient with masculine forms than with feminine or plural markings. Qualitative error analyses revealed that this group had a proclivity to overgeneralize the masculine for other agreement markings. The findings are discussed in relation to relevant theories of typical and impaired language acquisition. The implications for assessing and treating verb morphological deficits are highlighted.

# 1. Introduction

Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), also known as specific language impairment (SLI), is a prevalent developmental condition that significantly affects children’s language ability while hearing, nonverbal cognition, and neurological function are relatively preserved (Leonard 2014). These linguistic challenges have been shown to have a detrimental impact on their academic and social skills (Bishop et al. 2017, Whitehouse et al. 2009). DLD is adopted in this paper, following the recommendations of the CATALISE consortium (Bishop et al. 2017).

Inflectional verb morphology is particularly vulnerable in children with DLD acquiring English, the most studied language (e.g., Grela & Leonard 2000, Leonard et al. 2017, Souto et al. 2014, Rice & Wexler 1996) and a range of other languages (e.g., Blom et al. 2014 for Dutch, Chondrogianni & John 2019 for Welsh, Dromi et al. 1993 for Hebrew, Franck et al. 2004 for French, Rothweiler et al. 2012 for German). Cross-linguistic research has demonstrated that the typology of the target language influences the linguistic structures that pose difficulties for these children (Leonard 2014). As a result, clinical markers of DLD differ based on the language being acquired. For instance, while children with DLD acquiring Germanic languages such as Danish have trouble with verb tense/agreement (Krok & Leonard 2015, Vang Christensen & Hansson 2012), children with DLD learning Italian exhibit difficulties in acquiring clitic pronouns (Bortolini et al. 2002, Leonard $\&$ Dispaldro 2013). Additionally, variations in error patterns have been observed across investigations, with the most common being the omission of inflections or substitution of nonfinite forms, for example, “Yesterday mommy cook” (Rice & Wexler 1996, Rice et al. 2000). These findings underscore the necessity of investigating language development in typologically diverse languages and the critical nature of language-specific factors in DLD research. The current work adds to this corpus of cross-linguistic research by investigating DLD in a hitherto understudied language, Kuwaiti Arabic.

# 1.1. Verb morphology in DLD: cross-linguistic evidence

Although there is evidence from cross-linguistic research that children with DLD have difficulties with verb inflection, some argue (the morphological richness hypothesis) that languages with rich morphology, like Spanish, Italian, Greek, and Hebrew, pose less difficulties for these children than languages with less complex verb inflection, such as English (see Review in Leonard 2014). For instance, the results from children speaking Greek, a language with rich verbal morphology, displayed minimal differences between typically developing children and those with DLD in relation to verb agreement (Lalioti et al. 2016). However, the DLD group performed less accurately than both age- and language-matched groups in a verbal short-term memory task (nonword repetition), the other area that appears to be a major weakness in children with DLD.

Evidence from other languages with rich inflectional morphology shows that the difficulties encountered by children with DLD with these languages are limited to nongrammatical aspects. For instance, there is evidence from Spanish and Italian that children with DLD face difficulties mainly with phonologically less salient features such as clitics (e.g., Bedore & Leonard 2001 and Castilla-Earls et al. 2020 for Spanish, and Bortolini et al. 2006 for Italian).

Similarly, some studies in Hebrew also attribute the tense and agreement difficulties of children with DLD to nongrammatical factors. Dromi et al. (1993) found that the phonetic saliency of word patterns in terms of stress and lengthening explained the difference in accuracy in the present tense forms between the group with DLD and the language matched group. Once those pattern errors were not counted, provided the tense inflection was accurate, the group differences disappeared. Similar conclusions were reached in a follow-up study by Dromi et al. (1999) who compared the production of verb agreement in the past and present tense in Hebrew-speaking children with DLD to a languagematched TD group and an age-matched control group. The lower performance of the DLD group was interpreted as a processing problem resulting from the relative complexity of the verb paradigms. In another related study on Hebrew, Leonard et al. (2000) also concluded that at least for tense, the performance of the DLD group is comparable to that of the language-matched group except for one complex verbal pattern. They suggest that agreement is more challenging for children with DLD in Hebrew.

Overall, although there is some evidence that morphologically complex languages tend to present less difficulty for children with DLD when acquiring verbal morphology, there is considerable crosslinguistic variation. The present study provides additional evidence from another morphologically complex language, Kuwaiti Arabic. Building on previous studies on Arabic that showed that agreement is problematic for children with DLD (Abdalla & Crago 2008, Shaalan 2010, Fahim 2017, Taha et al. 2021), the present study examines in depth which feature(s) of subject-verb agreement can be considered a potential clinical marker in Arabic DLD. Before reviewing previous studies on verb agreement in Arabic and their relevance to the present study, we briefly describe verb morphology in Kuwaiti Arabic.

# 1.2. Kuwaiti Arabic

Although Arabic varieties share some structural and lexical similarities, such as the pro-drop/nullsubject feature, there is substantial variability, both lexical and structural (Holes 2004), that warrants variety-specific studies and therefore assessments to better serve the population of children with DLD. To start with, we need to clarify the diglossic situation in each Arab country (Ferguson 1959), which refers to the coexistence of at least two structurally and functionally distinct varieties, the standard high variety, which is Modern Standard Arabic, and the spoken variety(ies), which is the low variety(ies). The high variety is mainly a written language and spoken only in formal contexts, and the local spoken varieties, the native languages of their speakers, are used in everyday communication (e.g., Sayahi 2014). Apart from this main divide, there are several geographical varieties within the same country. Within Kuwait, the focus of our study, there are two main varieties, a rural (bedouin) variety and an urban variety (Mahsain 2014); our focus will be on the latter.

Verb inflection in this variety, like in Modern Standard Arabic, has three main verb tenses/aspects: the present (the imperfective), the past (the perfective), and the imperative. However, some linguists (e.g., Benmamoun 1999) argue that unlike the perfective, which is associated with the past, the imperfective does not carry tense. Arabic does not have a nonfinite/infinitive form. Like other Arabic varieties, Kuwaiti Arabic morphology is primarily nonconcatenative, where two noncontinuous morphemes are interwoven to make a word. These are mostly a three-consonantal root that carries the main meaning of the word and a melodic pattern that is made of both consonants and vowels that denote its grammatical elements (McCarthy 1981). For example, the word ‘rassaam’ ‘painter’ is composed of the triliteral root (r, s, m), which roughly refers to drawing, and the pattern (CaCCaaC), which indicates the functional meaning ‘doer’.

As indicated in Table 1, the present in Kuwaiti Arabic is marked by a prefix (ta-rsim, 3P F-stem of the verb, “She draws/is drawing.”) or a prefix and a suffix (ya-rsim-oon, 3P M-stem-Pl, “They draw/are drawing.”), which is separated from the stem ‘rsim’ for the sake of clarity (Aljenaie 2010). In the case of prefixation without suffixation, the person, gender, and number are all marked in one morpheme as in (ta-rsim). The past, conversely, is composed of a stem (risam) and a suffix that carries subject-verb agreement for person, number, and gender. The third-person masculine singular, however, does not carry a suffix. Because the present uses both prefixation and suffixation, its forms are more complex than those of the simple past. Finally, the imperative uses suffixes to indicate number and gender in the second-person feminine and number in the second-person plural, while the second-person masculine singular does not carry any affixes (Aljenaie 2010). As subject-verb agreement is the focus of the present study, the following section reviews existing research on the acquisition of verb agreement in Arabic-speaking TD and DLD children.

# 1.3. Verb agreement in Arabic-speaking children

The complex verb morphology of Arabic has piqued interest in examining the typical and atypical development of this feature in children. Studies that explored verb agreement in very small samples of TD children in Palestinian Arabic (Abdo & Abdo 1996 cited in Aljenaie 2001) and Kuwaiti Arabic (Aljenaie 2001) discovered a developmental pattern whereby the first person emerged earlier than the second or the third; singular forms were easier than the plural, and the masculine was more accurate than the feminine. In another study, Aljenaie (2010) found almost no tense errors in the spontaneous speech of three children (aged 1;8 to 3;1), and the relatively few agreement errors were in the form of omission or substitution of a default imperfective bare stem.

Similar to what has been found cross-linguistically (previous discussion), verb inflectional morphology appears to be a challenge for Arabic-speaking children with DLD (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Fahim 2017, Shaalan 2017, Taha et al. 2021). Abdalla & Crago (2008) examined verb morphology using spontaneous data collected from Saudi Urban Hijazi Arabic children with DLD (4;0 to 5;3) and their age- and language-matched peers. The children with DLD produced fewer correct forms than their control peers in the third-person singular, mainly in the present tense and the feminine agreement, which have more complex inflections (as previously discussed). In both samples, the imperative form was used as a default substitute for the target tense form (present or past).

Fahim (2017) who relied on spontaneous data production found that three preschool Egyptian Arabic-speaking children with DLD (aged 3;1 to 4;6 years) had difficulties in subject-verb agreement for person, gender, and number rather than tense, especially the past, compared to TD peers (aged 1;0 to 4;0 years). Fahim noted errors that resembled the imperative or imperfective (present tense) verb stem in her participants. In an elicitation study with three older participants (5;6 to 8;0 years), Morsi (2009) observed that the children with DLD had more difficulty with the present tense than with agreement. Similar to Fahim, she found that the default form used was an imperative form.

Although Shaalan (2010) did not have many test items, his expressive language test results showed that the children with DLD (aged 6 to 8;11) performed at a significantly lower level than their agematched peers on verb tense and agreement structures. However, the DLD group did better on the present tense than on the past, especially in the third-person feminine singular.

Taha et al. (2021) examined tense and agreement in an elicited speech production of 14 PalestinianArabic speaking children with DLD (aged 4 to 7;10) in comparison with TD age-matched peers (3;0– 8;0 years). Although children with DLD scored lower on total verb accuracy than children with TD $( 9 4 . 6 \% )$ , the DLD group maintained relatively high levels of accuracy $( 7 7 . 1 \% )$ . The children with DLD encountered special difficulties with the present tense forms and the feminine agreement inflections. In this population, the prevalent error substitution patterns were the imperative and imperfective bare stems.

Verb inflectional morphology in Kuwaiti Arabic has not been studied in children with DLD. The two available studies in the Kuwaiti context were carried out by Aljenaie (2001) on a very small sample of TD children acquiring Arabic inflected verbs for person, gender, and number. To summarize previous research on the performance of children with DLD who speak various Arabic dialects (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Fahim 2017, Taha et al. 2021), the main challenges these children faced were in aspects of agreement, particularly in the feminine verb inflection. Except for Shaalan (2010), all research to date has reported more difficulties in the present tense (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Taha et al. 2021). Shaalan’s findings can be attributed to methodological variations resulting from the small item size. Moreover, age differences may partially account for the discrepancy in findings, as some participants were older 8 or 9-year-old children (Shaalan 2010, Taha et al. 2021), while others were younger 4 to 5-year-old preschoolers (Abdalla & Crago 2008, Fahim 2017).

As is the case in other languages, prior research on verb inflection errors indicates that children with DLD have a general tendency to use a default form when faced with structurally complex finite forms. The least inflected (underspecified) form was regarded as the default substitution, with some studies of Arabic child language (overviewed above) reporting the imperfective (present tense) verb stem and others the imperative. Given that both the imperative and imperfective bare stems have been attested in the language of young TD children, these substitutions could represent distinct default forms. Alternatively, as suggested by Benmamoun (1999) and Shahin (2010), the imperfective stem constitutes the default since the imperative is derived from the imperfective verb stem.

# 1.4. DLD explanatory accounts

The reason why certain grammatical morphology features cause difficulties for children with DLD has been a source of contention. Competing hypotheses have been proposed for the delayed emergence of verb inflectional morphology and its varied language-specific manifestations. In light of the outcomes of the current study, two pertinent accounts are discussed: the morphological richness hypothesis (Leonard 2014) and the agreement deficit account (Clahsen 1989).

The morphological richness hypothesis seeks to account for the observed language-specific variability in inflectional morphology across studies (Leonard 2014). According to the morphological richness account, children with DLD have a general processing constraint, which limits their cognitive resources (Leonard 2014). While children with DLD exhibit grammatical difficulties irrespective of the language they are learning, the main assumption of the morphological richness hypothesis is that children learn to focus on the structural processes in the ambient language (e.g., word order and grammatical morphology) that transmit the most critical information (Berman 1986, Leonard 2014; Slobin 1985). As a result, children acquiring languages with rich morphology, such as Hebrew and Italian, allocate more resources to grammatical morphology and thus exhibit less trouble with tense and agreement inflection than their counterparts acquiring sparsely inflected languages such as English (Dromi et al. 1993, Leonard et al. 1992). Leonard (2014) identifies a limitation in the benefits of the morphological richness hypothesis in certain languages with rich inflection. At times, the processing demands may exceed the child with DLD’s resources, especially if the morphology is complex, as in Hungarian, which distinguishes verbs on four dimensions: definiteness, tense, person, and number (Lukacs et al. 2009).

The morphological richness account assumes that if an error occurs, the substituted inflection retains the original inflection’s features. A stronger alternative with comparable characteristics will compete with a child’s weakly represented target (Lukacs et al. 2009). Hence, the presence of frequent near-miss errors in which the incorrect verb inflection deviates from the target by a single feature (e.g., the past tense, third-person masculine singular for the past tense, third-person feminine singular). Interestingly, Arabic-speaking children with DLD were observed to produce such near-miss errors (Abdalla & Crago 2008, Taha et al. 2021).

Alternative explanations such as the agreement deficit hypothesis assume that the difficulty with verbs is due to impairments in specific grammatical mechanisms rather than a general processing limitation (Clahsen 1989). In the agreement deficit account, children with DLD are considered to have selective deficits in generating grammatical agreement relations in an otherwise intact language system. Accordingly, establishing finiteness may be challenging for children with DLD, owing to the absence of subject feature paradigms for person and number. Hence, the agreement deficit hypothesis views subject-verb agreement rather than verb tense marking as the underlying issue in DLD (Clahsen 1989, Clahsen et al. 1997). Under the agreement deficit account, errors in productions are anticipated to be default substitutions. It is hypothesized that children with DLD generate accurate subject-verb agreement through rote learning.

Overall, the aforementioned explanatory models predict disparate outcomes for children with DLD learning a highly inflected language like Arabic. In the morphological richness account, the participants with DLD are expected to have less trouble with verb agreement, whereas the agreement deficit hypothesis predicts subject-verb agreement to be problematic. The prediction for error patterns also varies; the morphological richness account predicts near-misses and the agreement deficit hypothesis anticipates subject-verb error substitutions.

The current study aims to contribute to this growing body of cross-linguistic DLD literature by examining the production of verb agreement morphology in a richly-inflected variety of Arabic, Kuwaiti Arabic, which has some unique subject-verb inflections compared to the other Arabic dialects reported in the related literature. Moreover, as the first study that explores subject-verb agreement in Kuwaiti Arabic in a DLD sample, it will provide necessary data for the development of much-needed valid assessment measures in this language variety, in addition to contributing to the literature on typical and atypical Arabic language acquisition.

# 1.5. The current study

Apart from being the first study to examine verb agreement in Kuwaiti Arabic with DLD, the present study uses a sample with both age and language matched controls, which has not been the case in previous comparable Arabic studies (e.g., Taha et al. 2021). A dual control design permits researchers to draw comparisons between the DLD group and children of similar age and language (Leonard & Finneran 2003, Rice et al. 2006). The use of chronological-age matched controls as the only comparator may be problematic because these children have typically achieved mastery of the target structure (Leonard & Finneran 2003). Whereas, comparing children with DLD to language-matched controls can establish whether parallels in overall competence or error patterns on a language task between the two groups suggest a delay or deviation in the DLD group (Rice et al. 2006).

Additionally, this study explores verb inflectional morphology in more detail by focusing on specific structures, considering that verb agreement has been noted as an issue in Arabic DLD studies as well as in Hebrew, another Semitic language with similar morphology (previously noted review). According to data from TD children, the third person is more challenging and develops later than the first person (e.g., Aljenaie 2010). Abdalla & Crago (2008) observed less frequent use of third-person verbs due to the scarcity of specific forms in spontaneous speech and the apparent avoidance of complex structures by children with DLD. To compare our findings with cross-linguistic DLD studies and explanatory hypotheses, we also sought to evaluate whether agreement (gender and number) per se is a problem. Thus, the third person is the focus of the current investigation because it requires both gender and number inflectional marking (unlike the first person), and is pragmatically easier to elicit than the first or second persons. During the video elicitation task, the child had the option of responding in either the present or past tense. Ultimately, their performance was evaluated solely on the accuracy of their agreement, irrespective of tense. Only one study (Taha et al. 2021) investigated third-person verb agreement further, however, they included fewer verbs for the feminine forms. The present study used a variety of verbs to systematically explore third-person verb agreement.

The majority of Arabic studies on DLD relied on spontaneous data (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Fahim 2005). The current study is among the limited research that systematically examined subject-verb agreement using an elicitation technique. Picture stimuli have long been a common method for eliciting verb structures (e.g., Shaalan 2010, Taha et al. 2021). By their very nature, actions are dynamic, making it difficult to capture their motion in a static form (Mineo et al. 2008, Schlosser et al. 2012). Interestingly, Schlosser et al. (2012) found that using animation to illustrate actions enhanced preschool children’s ability to recognize verbs and identify verb agreement. Unlike previous studies that relied on static images (e.g., Taha et al. 2021), the current study used video-recorded actions to elicit target verbs.

The few studies that used probes to elicit target structures, for example, Shaalan (2010) and Taha et al. (2021), had some limitations. Shaalan’s (2010) study had a few items that precluded generalizations. In Taha et al. (2021) and Shaalan (2010), the elicitation probe disclosed information about the intended tense and subject-verb agreement. For example, in Taha et al. (2021), the child was shown a picture and asked, “What did the girl do?” The target in this case was a feminine singular past tense verb. In Arabic, the verb “do” that was used in the probe possessed the same morphological features as the target: that is, past tense and feminine singular agreement. Furthermore, Shaalan (2010) and Taha et al. (2021) recruited a wider age range of participants with DLD. Our study focused on younger children with DLD, aged 4 to 5 years. The subject-verb agreement targets in the current study were three types of third-person inflections: feminine singular, masculine singular, and plural. The following are the research questions and relevant hypotheses in light of the Arabic and cross-linguistic DLD literature.

(1) Do the Kuwaiti children with DLD use verb agreement marking (gender and number) as accurately as their TD chronological age and language-matched peers?

As observed in cross-linguistic studies (e.g., Castilla-Earls et al. 2020) and various Arabic dialects (Abdalla & Crago 2008, Fahim 2017, Shaalan 2010, Taha et al. 2022), we anticipated that the group with DLD would be less accurate in using overall verb agreement than chronologically-aged matched TD children. Based on data from typical language development in Kuwaiti Arabic (Aljenaie 2010), we expected that the TD-LA children would be relatively proficient at inflecting verbs for agreement. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the mean length of utterance (MLU)-matched TD children will either outperform the DLD group (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Kunnari et al. 2011) or that no group differences will be observed (e.g., Bortolini et al. 1997, Rice & Wexler 1996).

(2) Is there a difference in the children’s ability to use the third-person verb inflections (feminine singular, masculine singular and plural)?

Verb agreement types are expected to vary in accuracy, with the feminine gender marker and plural forms being more difficult than the masculine singular, as found by Abdalla & Crago (2008) and Taha et al. (2021).

(3) What are the predominant error patterns for verb inflectional morphology among Kuwaiti children with DLD?

Based on error profiles observed in other languages (e.g., Paradis & Crago 2000, Rothweiler et al. 2017), we hypothesized that the children with DLD would substitute default, less inflected forms for target verb agreement. The second-person masculine imperative forms (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Morsi 2009, Taha et al. 2021) or the imperfective bare stem (Aljenaie 2010, Fahim 2017, Shahin 2010) are predicated as alternative defaults.

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Participants

A nonprobability convenience sampling technique was used to select 30 monolingual Kuwaiti Arabicspeaking children for this study. The Institutional Review Board of Kuwait University’s Faculty of Medicine granted ethics approval for this study. Additionally, the parents provided informed written consent for their children to participate in the study. The participants were divided into three groups, each consisting of 10 children: a group with DLD (Mean age 4;4 years); a group of ten typically developing children of comparable mean chronological age of 4;5 years (TD-CA); and a group of ten language-age matched children (TD-LA) with equivalent MLU in words (Mean age $= 2 ; 7$ years). The background information for the three groups of children is presented in Table 2. MLU in words (MLUw) was chosen over MLU in morphemes (MLUm) because Shaalan & Khater (2006) found a strong correlation between MLUw and MLU in productive morphemes (MLUpm) in Arabicspeaking children’s spontaneous language samples. The authors proposed MLUw as a valid and simplified measure of language development. Additionally, using MLUw avoids the confounding effect caused by the fact that the dependent variable of interest involves verb inflectional morphology (Paradis & Crago 2000). The following is an example of a TD-LA child’s utterance that consists of two words if ‘word count’ rather than ‘morpheme count’ is used.

The preschool children with DLD (six boys and four girls) and TD-CA children (four boys and six girls) were between four and five years old. As indicated in Table 2, an independent $t \cdot$ -test revealed that their mean ages in months were not statistically different. The age of each child in the TD-CA group was within 2 months of a participant in the DLD group. The children in the TD-LA group (six boys and four girls) were younger than the TD-CA and children with DLD, as shown in Table 2. With respect to MLU in words, the DLD group and the TD-LA matched controls were not significantly different, as evident from Table 2. At least one child with DLD was within 0.1 MLU (words) of a participant in the TD-LA group (Rice et al. 1995).

The children with DLD were receiving speech-language therapy at the Sheikh Salem Al-Ali Center for Speech and Hearing, a governmental specialty clinic in Kuwait. Senior Arabic-speaking speech language pathologists diagnosed the children with a language impairment of unknown etiology. As described in further detail in the following sections, they satisfied generally accepted inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for DLD, such as the presence of language impairments without hearing, neurological, socioemotional, or cognitive difficulties. According to their clinical records and referral reports from their developmental specialists, they passed a hearing screening (20 dB), had no history of neurological disorder, and exhibited no signs of autism spectrum disorder or socioemotional deficits. Their nonverbal index on the Primary Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (PTONI) (Ehrler & McGhee 2008) was not significantly different from the TD-CA group and fell within the average range (Table 2). Moreover, they demonstrated adequate speech intelligibility as measured by the Intelligibility in Context Scale -Standard Arabic (McLeod et al. (2012) and a one-word Kuwaiti Arabic articulation test (Alshatti et al. 2011).

There were no standardized language evaluation batteries for Kuwaiti Arabic at the time of this study, making it challenging to identify language disorders. We established that these children had language impairments not only through the judgments and assessment results of qualified speechlanguage pathologists, but also through their performance on two Gulf Arabic receptive and expressive language measures developed by Shaalan (see Shaalan 2017 for a description of each test). We used the mean raw scores on the Sentence Comprehension (SC) and Expressive Language (EL) tests, as neither test is standardized. Table 2 presents the TD-CA and DLD groups’ raw data for each test. Independent $t$ -test results provided in Table 2 demonstrate that the DLD group scored significantly lower than the TD-CA. Additionally, an analysis of their connected language samples was performed to further assess the children’s language ability. Notably, Dunn et al. (1996) reported that measures based on children’s natural language samples, such as MLU and utterances with structural errors, were more consistent with the clinical diagnosis of DLD than psychometric test results. The language sample analyses further confirmed that the children with DLD had a lower MLUw, less lexical diversity as measured by the number of different words, and an increased number of grammatical errors than the TD-CA children.

The two groups of typically-developing children (TD-CA and TD-LA) were recruited through local nurseries and preschools. Parental and teacher case history records were used to gather information about the children’s development. Additionally, the Arabic version of the Speech and Language Assessment Scale (SLAS) (Hadley & Rice 1993) was used to assist the parents in describing their child’s language in terms of articulation, semantics, syntax, assertiveness, and responsiveness. According to both sources, the children had achieved developmental milestones as expected, with no suspected difficulties in receptive and expressive language, intellectual, or socioemotional problems. The children had passed a health screening as part of their school enrollment. PTONI, the sentence comprehension and expressive language measures described earlier were administered to the TD-CA group, and their performance was unremarkable, as displayed in Table 2. The parents of the younger TD-LA children completed the Kuwaiti Arabic Communicative Development Inventory-Words and Sentences (KA-CDI) (Abdalla et al. 2016) in addition to SLAS and case history. No language or intellectual concerns emerged for the TD-LA group. An independent-samples $t \cdot$ -test showed no significant difference in KA-CDI total words for the TD-LA $\cdot n = 1 0$ , $M = 3 1 6 . 2$ , $S D = 1 0 1$ ) and the pilot data on typically-developing Kuwaiti children aged 24 to 36 months ${ \dot { n } } = 9 4 .$ , $M = 2 8 7 . 4$ , $S D = 1 4 3 . 4 ) $ , $t ( 1 0 2 ) = - . 6 2$ , $ { p } = . 5 4$ . The participants were monolingual based on parental reports and enrollment in a monolingual nursery/preschool.

# 2.2. Verb elicitation measure

An experimental measure was designed to probe feminine singular, masculine singular and plural agreement marking for third-person verbs in Kuwaiti Arabic. The stimuli consisted of action verbs that could be enacted. The verbs were within the repertoire of Kuwaiti Arabic-speaking children aged 24 to 30 months, as per Aljenaie (2001)’s longitudinal study. Additionally, the parental reports from the pilot KA-CDI confirmed that the participants were familiar with the target action words.

Volunteers aged 10 to 12 years were videotaped using a Sony HDR-CX405 as they acted out 10 to 15 second scenarios for each verb. Each video segment featured an action verb that addressed a specific agreement. For example, “a girl washing her hands” was designed to elicit agreement for the feminine gender, while “a boy washing his hands” and “a group of three or four children washing their hands” targeted the masculine and plural markers, respectively.

The video clips were around 5 to 7 seconds in length and were arranged randomly using the Windows Moviemaker software. A blank animated transition slide separated the video segments. A short humorous clip (e.g., “I’m Gummy Bear.”) was displayed as a reinforcer after every five presentations. The 45- clip video was piloted on 10 typically-developing Kuwaiti children (aged 3-7 years) and 10 adults. Based on feedback from the pilot, the duration of the video was reduced, a few ambiguous actions were eliminated (e.g., buy and throw), and the elicitation protocol was further improved. The final video stimuli consisted of 33 verbs, 12 of which required agreement for the feminine singular, 9 for the masculine singular, and 12 for the plural (see Appendix A for a list of the verbs and Appendix B for sample images). Testing was preceded by six practice clips depicting two verbs (“eat” and “hit”) marking the three types of agreement to familiarize the children with the procedure.

# 2.3. Procedure

Two trained Kuwaiti-Arabic speaking research assistants tested each child in a quiet room (at the clinic or preschool). The research assistant followed a predetermined research protocol for eliciting the verb inflections. The training and test video clips were displayed on a 17-inch Dell laptop to elicit the target responses from each participant individually. The verb inflections were probed via video presentation.

To avoid providing clues regarding the target verb agreement, a neutral question (1) was used rather than (2), as was the case in Taha et al. (2021), which reveals the target inflection. Notice that in Example 2, the participant can detect that the question requires the past tense, third-person feminine singular marker.

1. ʃnu ʃift bil fidio? What see-past 2MS in-the video Gloss: “What did you see in the video (clip)?”

2. ʃnu sawat ilbneya? What do-past tense-3FS the-girl Gloss: “What did the girl do?”

Following each clip, the child was questioned about what he or she had seen. If the child required prompting, the examiner said expectantly, “The girl/the boy/the children $\underline { { \ ? } } ^ { \gamma }$ (using the appropriate subject for the context). The examiner verbally encouraged the child throughout the experiment without providing corrective feedback. Each participant’s responses were audio-recorded using an Olympus portable digital voice recorder. The examiner also recorded the child’s responses on a scoring sheet. The elicitation task lasted approximately 30 to 45 minutes.

# 2.4. Scoring and data analysis

Two native Arabic-speaking research assistants who were unaware of the project’s aim independently transcribed and scored the participants’ responses. Point-by-point agreement for correct or incorrect verb inflection productions averaged $1 0 0 \%$ . The children’s productions were further classified into: 1) morphologically correct (MC), morphological substitution (MS) and nonmorphological responses (NM) following a similar procedure for nominal plurals in Abdalla et al. (2013). NM and MS responses are explained in more detail as follows, along with examples of each in Table 3. MC productions were either supplied with the correct masculine, feminine, or plural form (examples of correct targets can be found in Appendix A). All responses, whether in the past or the present, were accepted, as the focus of the current study was subject-verb agreement.

Agreement scoring was not straightforward due to the fusional nature of verb agreement in Kuwaiti Arabic (see Table 1). Concatenate affixes and consonant roots combine to yield various verb forms that express tense, aspect, and subject-verb agreement for person, gender, and number. The verb agreement for the present study was third-person. Each singular third-person form was a fusion of masculine and feminine features. The third-person plural agreement did not vary by gender. Three categories of subject-verb agreement were scored: person (third-person), gender (masculine, feminine), and number (singular, plural). The agreement accuracy was determined using Abdalla & Crago’s (2008) procedure, which involved comparing the child’s output (person, gender, and number) to the agreement features of the target action and subject in the video, regardless of tense type. Any response that did not adhere to the local adult dialect was deemed incorrect. The maximum possible score was 33, with a correct score of 1 and an incorrect score of 0.

Table 3 presents examples of error responses from the children’s data. The two main error types were morphological substitutions (MS) and nonmorphological responses (NM). Examples of NM responses included using nouns for the target verb, as can be seen in Examples 9 and 10 (Table 3). No response errors were counted as NM. MS were characterized by the incorrect substitution of verb inflectional markers for the appropriate masculine, feminine, or plural agreement. Examples 1 and 2 in Table 3 show third-person masculine forms $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 3 \mathrm { M S } } )$ that were used as substitutes for feminine or plural third-person targets. Example 3 represents feminine third-person $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 3 \mathrm { F S } } )$ substitutes for thirdperson plural targets. The plural substitutes for masculine or feminine forms were categorized as ${ \mathrm { M S } } _ { 3 { \mathrm { P L } } }$ . However, no such latter type errors occurred in the child data. A hypothetical example of ${ \mathrm { M S } } _ { 3 { \mathrm { p L } } }$ is provided in Table 3, Example 4. First-person singular inflections $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 1 \mathrm { s } } )$ instead of the correct feminine or plural third-person forms are illustrated in Examples 5 and 6. The imperative (secondperson masculine singular) (MS2MS-mperative) for the target feminine or plural third-person markers is shown in Examples 7 and 8.

a This is a hypothetical example, as there were no plural substitutes for the feminine or masculine gender.

For each participant, a composite percentage score was derived by summing all the correct verb inflection tokens, dividing by the total number of verb inflection contexts $\mathrm { \Delta M C + M S + N M ) }$ and multiplying by 100. IBM SPSS Statistics software Version 25 was used to conduct all statistical analyses (IBM Corporation 2017). Suitable nonparametric statistical methods were used to analyze the data to circumvent the issue of sample size. A series of one-way Kruskal-Wallis H tests were performed to compare the children’s performance (group as the between-subjects factor with three levels -DLD, TD-CA, and TD-LA) and the target percentage correct third-person agreement form as the dependent variable. Significant results were followed by the Mann Whitney U test. Withinsubject group comparisons were conducted using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The $\boldsymbol { p }$ -value for significance was set at .05, and a Bonferroni adjustment was applied for multiple comparisons to control for Type 1 error $( . 0 5 / 5 = . 0 1 { \dot { } }$ ). Within-group comparisons for correct gender and number agreement inflections were conducted for the DLD group. Descriptive statistical analyses are presented for error comparisons.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Overall verb agreement accuracy

The mean percentage of correct third-person verb agreement (gender and number) obtained through an elicitation probe was compared across the three groups of participants -DLD, TD-CA, and TD-LA. Figure 1 presents a box plot of the data for each morpheme category. A Kruskal-Wallis Test revealed a statistically significant difference in percent correct verb agreement scores across groups (DLD, TDCA, and TD-LA), $H ( 2 ) = 2 3 . 6 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . The DLD group had a lower median (30.3) than the TD-CA (100) and TD-LA (95.5). Pairwise comparisons using Mann-Whitney U Test showed $\mathrm { D L D < T D - L A < }$ TD-CA $\left( p < . 0 1 \right)$ . The group with DLD was significantly less accurate than the TD-CA, $U = . 0 0 1$ , $z$ $= - 3 . 9 6 .$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = . 8 8$ and TD-LA, $U = . 0 0 1$ , $z = - 3 . 7 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = . 8 4$ . The older TD-CA group scored significantly higher than the TD-LA group, $U = 1 7 . 5$ , $z = - 2 . 7 8$ , $p < . 0 1 1$ , $r = . 6 2$ . According to Cohen (1988) criteria, the effect sizes are considered large (higher than .5).

Overall, as noted earlier, the group with DLD scored lower than either of the TD control groups. A series of Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni adjustments were conducted to contrast the three groups of children in gender and number verb agreement accuracy.

# 3.2. Gender and number agreement accuracy

As can be seen in Figure 1, despite the group with DLD’s relatively high scores for the masculine singular form $M d n _ { \mathrm { D L D } } = 7 7 . 8 )$ , their performance was significantly lower than either of the TD groups $( M d n _ { \mathrm { T D - C A } } = 1 0 0 $ ; $U = 1 5$ , $z = - 3 . 1 2$ , $ { p } < . 0 0 2$ ; $M d n _ { \mathrm { T D - L A } } = 1 0 0$ ; $U = 1 9$ , $z = - 2 . 5 8$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p < . 0 1 \ r _ { . } } \end{array}$ ). The TD groups were not significantly different for the masculine singular $( p = . 4 8 )$ .

The difference for the feminine singular was statistically significant, with the DLD group $( M d n _ { \mathrm { D L D } } = 2 5 )$ ) exhibiting less proficiency than the age-matched peers $( M d n _ { \mathrm { T D - C A } } = 1 0 0 )$ ; $U = . 0 0 0$ , $z = - 4 . 0 5$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ ) and the MLU-matched group $( M d n _ { \mathrm { T D - L A } } = 9 5 . 8 $ ; $U = 2$ , $z = - 3 . 6 7$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ . The older TD group was superior to the TD-LA group in marking the feminine singular ( $U = 2 5$ , $z = - 2 . 4 9$ , $p < . 0 1$ ).

The length of the box corresponds to the interquartile range of the variable and includes $5 0 \%$ of the cases. The horizontal line inside the box represents the median value. The whiskers that extend from the box represent the minimum and maximum values. Outliers are displayed as circles.

A similar pattern emerged for the plural forms, whereby the TD-CA $( M d n _ { \mathrm { T D - C A } } = 1 0 0 )$ ) significantly outperformed the DLD group $( M d n _ { \mathrm { D L D } } = 0$ ; $U = . 0 0 0$ , $z = - 4 . 0 2 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , and the TD-LA group $( M d n _ { \mathrm { T D - L A } } = 9 1 . 7 $ ; $U = 1 8$ , $z = - 2 . 7 4$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p < . 0 0 6 ) } \end{array}$ . The TD-LA group’s scores for the plural exceeded those of the DLD group ( $U = . 0 0 0$ , $z = - 3 . 8 4$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p < . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ ).

Within the DLD group, the third-person masculine singular inflection fared better than the other two inflectional forms (see Figure 1). Indeed, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test revealed that the DLD group were statistically better at correctly producing the masculine singular $( M d n = 7 7 . 8 )$ ) than the feminine singular forms, $( M d n = 2 5$ ), $z = - 2 . 8 0 , p < . 0 0 5$ . Likewise, the percentage correct scores for the masculine singular were statistically higher than those for the plural $( M d n = 0 )$ , $z = - 2 . 8 1$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 5 )$ . However, the feminine singular and plural inflections were not statistically different, $z = - 1 . 0 2$ , $p = . 3 1$ .

# 3.3. Error patterns

This section explores error patterns that emerged in the verb inflection data elicited from children with DLD and the comparison TD groups. Recall that the incorrect forms were categorized into either morphological substitution (MS) or nonmorphological responses (NM) as described in the method section and Table 3. Figure 2 presents the pattern of morphological substitution errors (percentages) observed in the DLD and TD-LA children’s responses.

Four types of morphological substitutions (MS) were observed in the data. 1) Third-person masculine forms $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 3 \mathrm { M S } } )$ used as substitutes for the target third-person feminine singular (3FS) or plural (3PL) targets. 2) Third-person feminine $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 3 \mathrm { F S } } )$ as substitutes for third-person masculine (3MS) or plural targets. 3) First-person singular inflections $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 1 \mathrm { S } } )$ instead of the correct 3MS, 3FS, or 3PL forms. 4) The second-person masculine singular imperative $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 2 \mathrm { M S - m p e r a t i v e } } )$ for the target 3MS, 3FS, or 3PL markers. There were no instances of plural forms $( \mathrm { M S } _ { 3 \mathrm { P L } } )$ being used in place of 3MS or 3FS. The final category of errors consisted of nonmorphological alternatives (NM) such as nouns instead of the target inflected verb. No responses were also classified as NM.

![](img/fa0e70d865fb13026c7935eec92e0c0a51ed05fa724ba78ef81f035f9a7d777d.jpg)  
Figure 2. Percentage of morphological substitution error patterns for target third person forms by the DLD and TD-LA children. Abbreviations: $\mathsf { D L D = }$ developmental language disorder; TD-LA, typically developing controls – 10 language-matched; Note. $3 M S = 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ person masculine singular; $\bar { 3 } \mathsf { F S } = 3 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ person feminine singular; $3 \mathsf { P L } = 3 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ person plural; $\bar { 1 } \mathsf { S } = 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ person singular; $2 M S = 2 ^ { n d }$ person masculine singular imperative.

The group with DLD was more likely to use morphological substitutions $( \mathrm { t o t a l } = 1 5 8 , 7 4 . 9 \% )$ than nonmorphological responses (total $= 5 3$ , $2 5 . 1 \%$ ). However, even though the TD-LA children were highly accurate in their responses, their errors displayed a reverse preference -a higher incidence of nonmorphological $\mathrm { ( t o t a l } = 2 0 , 7 6 . 9 \% )$ than morphological $\mathrm { ' t o t a l } = 6 , 2 3 . 1 \% )$ .

Figure 2 reveals that the third-person masculine inflection was the most prevalent morphological substitution for the DLD group $( n = 1 1 7 , 7 4 . 0 5 \% )$ and the TD-LA group $\left( n = 5 , 8 3 . 3 3 \% \right)$ ). In the group with DLD, these substitutions were similar whether the target was the 3FS $\left( n = 4 9 , 3 1 . 0 1 \% \right)$ or the plural ( ${ \dot { n } } = 6 8 ;$ , $4 3 . 0 4 \%$ ) (Examples E1 and E2, Table 3). As can be seen in Figure 2, the feminine inflection was rarely used as a substitute ( $1 . 3 \%$ of all morphological substitutions)—only twice for the plural and none for the masculine in the DLD group (Example E3, Table 3). Moreover, no instances of using the plural in lieu of the singular forms were observed (hypothetical Example E4, Table 3).

As shown in Figure 2, the next common substitution form in the DLD group was the imperativesecond person masculine $\cdot n = 3 4$ , $2 1 . 5 2 \%$ ). This replaced the 3MS $\dot { \boldsymbol n } = 1 0$ , $6 . 3 3 \%$ ), the 3FS $_ { \cdot n = 1 5 }$ , $9 . 4 9 \%$ ), and the 3PL $( n = 9 , \ 5 . 7 \% )$ ) (Examples E7 and E8, Table 3). The first-person singular as presented in Figure 2 was used five times as a substitute by the DLD group $\left( 3 . 1 6 \% \right)$ and once by the TD-LA $( 1 6 . 6 7 \% )$ (Examples E5 and E6, Table 3).

It is worth noting that $4 0 \%$ of the children with DLD who had the lowest accuracy level were more likely to use imperative substitutions (24 out of 34 occurrences) and nonmorphological replacements (40 out of a total of 53). As noted earlier, the children’s responses were considered correct as long as the correct subject-verb agreement was supplied. In other words, the verb was scored as correct for subject-verb agreement irrespective of the tense type - present or past tense. The error substitutes were of both tense variations.

# 4. Discussion

The purpose of this study was to compare the production of verb agreement inflection in Kuwaiti Arabic-speaking children with DLD with two groups of TD children using a novel elicitation method. Specifically, we sought to determine whether: (a) children with DLD performed differently than children with TD in terms of correct verb inflection use; (b) accuracy varied according to the type of third-person verb inflection used (masculine singular, feminine singular, and plural); and (c) despite quantitative differences, the DLD group, like the TD-LA group, resorted to the third person masculine inflection in morphological substitutions.

# 4.1. Overall subject-verb agreement

Quantitative analyses confirmed our first hypothesis that the children with DLD had significantly lower correct verb agreement (gender and number combined) than the TD groups. In contrast to other languages with rich inflectional morphology in which verbal agreement is not an issue for children with DLD, such as Italian (Bortolini et al. 2006) and Spanish (Bedore & Leonard 2001), difficulties with verbal agreement appear to be a clinical marker for Arabic DLD, as previously found in DLD studies across Arabic dialects such as Egyptian Arabic (Fahim 2017, Morsi 2009), Qatari Arabic (Shaalan 2010), Palestinian Arabic (Taha et al. 2021) and Saudi-Hijazi Arabic (Abdalla & Crago 2008). Although the findings in Hebrew, a Semitic language like Arabic, show that children with DLD have difficulties in verbal morphology, they were attributed mainly to nonmorphological factors, namely a lack of phonological salience (Dromi et al. 1993) and the complexity of some word patterns (Dromi et al. 1999, Leonard et al. 2000).

The TD-LA children exhibited overall subject-verb agreement mastery, which is comparable with Aljenaie’s (2010) Kuwaiti typical language development data. The TD-LA significantly outperformed the DLD group, confirming Abdalla & Crago’s (2008) findings for Saudi Hijazi Arabic-speaking children with DLD.

As predicted, variations in verb inflection type were detected across the participants. The children with DLD were significantly less accurate than either of the TD children on all three types of agreement markers (masculine singular, feminine singular, and plural).

# 4.2. Masculine and feminine singular verb agreement

A gender effect was observed for the group with DLD, with the masculine being superior to the feminine. Although the performance of the TD groups was almost at ceiling, a comparable pattern emerged, with the older group (TD-CA) scoring significantly higher on the feminine singular than the TD-LA but not on the masculine singular.

Previous studies demonstrated a similar trend for children with DLD, with the masculine being easier than the feminine (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Taha et al. 2021). The closest study in terms of age group (48 to 63 months) is that of Abdalla & Crago (2008), who discovered a similar pattern to our findings for Saudi Hijazi Arabic. The DLD group mastery of the third-person masculine was approximately $6 8 \%$ (current study $8 2 \%$ ), and the feminine singular was around $3 3 \%$ (current study $2 4 \%$ ). The results in Taha et al. (2021) found a comparable pattern with respect to masculine versus feminine but with much higher accuracy, perhaps due to their older age group (48 to 94 months): accuracy at $9 7 \%$ , $8 8 \%$ , and $9 2 \%$ , respectively.

Notably, for Kuwaiti Arabic (Aljenaie 2001) and other Arabic dialects such as Egyptian (Omar 1973), and Palestinian (Abdo & Abdo 1986 cited in Aljenaie 2001), the masculine agreement emerged earlier than the feminine forms in typically developing children. The Kuwaiti children with DLD may also be going through a similar developmental sequence, with higher accuracy for the masculine than the feminine forms. The notion that an inflectional marker appears to be less difficult is not limited to Arabic verbs. Abdalla et al. (2013) found that the regular feminine singular was more accurate than the regular masculine singular in noun plural development. Furthermore, the error analysis clearly illustrated the dominance of the masculine inflection in the current investigation.

The analysis of error patterns revealed that both the DLD and TD-LA groups committed substitution errors by using the third-person masculine singular form instead of the third-person feminine. This is consistent with previous research, which found that the masculine singular form is frequently used instead of the feminine singular in typically developing children (e.g., Aljenaie 2001, 2010; Omar 1973) and in children with DLD (Abdalla & Crago 2008, Taha et al. 2021).

A similar result was found in the speech of heritage speakers of Arabic, where the unmarked singular masculine in subject-verb agreement is more preserved than the feminine in the speech of these speakers (Albirini et al. 2013). The masculine singular verb form has ostensibly been used as the unmarked form because it is morphologically less complex than the feminine singular, specifically in the past tense where the masculine is mainly a bare stem while the feminine requires a suffix (e.g., as can be seen in the examples in Table 1 for third person, the masculine past tense carries no suffix “risam” while the feminine ends with at “rismat” and the plural requires aw “rismaw”). The reverse pattern of the feminine inflection as a substitute for the masculine was rare (only two instances in the group with DLD).

# 4.3. Plural verb agreement

In terms of number agreement, the plural was less accurate than the masculine singular in the DLD group. The older TD control children scored significantly higher than the DLD and the younger TD groups on the plural marker.

This finding that singular forms are more accurate, especially the masculine singular, has been corroborated in TD children speaking Kuwaiti Arabic (Aljenaie 2001), Egyptian Arabic (Omar 1973), and Palestinian Arabic (Abdu & Abdu 1986). A similar trend was also confirmed in Arabicspeaking children with DLD (Palestinian Arabic: Taha et al. 2021; Saudi Hijazi Arabic: Abdalla & Crago 2008; Qatari Arabic: Shaalan 2017; Egyptian Arabic: Fahim 2017, and Morsi 2009). Abdalla & Crago (2008) reported that Saudi Hijazi Arabic-speaking children with DLD of comparable ages (48 to 63 months) scored approximately $2 9 \%$ for the third-person plural, in contrast to the current study’s $1 3 \%$ . Heritage speakers of Arabic were also found to be less accurate with the plural form (Albirini et al. 2013).

Analysis of errors indicated a similar pattern, in which the masculine singular inflection was frequently substituted for the plural forms, particularly in the DLD group. There appears to be a tendency toward simplification and unidirectionality in the data, as none of the singular inflectional targets were replaced by the plural.

# 4.4. Other error types

As noted previously, children with DLD used the feminine singular and plural inflectional forms less accurately. When errors occurred, the singular masculine forms were the preferred substitutes for both the feminine singular and plural forms. The second most common morphological substitution error among the children with DLD was the use of the second-person masculine imperative instead of the third-person feminine singular or plural forms. The use of masculine imperatives aligns with findings from other DLD studies such as Abdalla & Crago (2008), Fahim (2017), Morsi (2009), and Taha et al. (2021).

Additionally, some children with DLD were observed to substitute the first-person singular for the 3FS and 3PL markers. Conversely, the 3MS was significantly more common among the participants with DLD than the 2MS imperative or the first-person singular (see Figure 2). How is this explicable? A cursory examination revealed that children with DLD, whose overall scores were lower, frequently resorted to the imperative. As a result, multiple stages of development may exist depending on the sort of errors produced by the child. An earlier stage would be to avoid inflection (imperative or bare stem), followed by overgeneralization of the masculine inflection.

Paradis & Crago (2001) suggested that the error substitutes be viewed as the default. The term “default” is more generic in characterizing the error substitute forms observed across languages. Therefore, regardless of whether the error is an imperative, masculine, or imperfective stem, the child defaults to a less complex target. Moreover, “default” appears to account for the morphological errors documented in Arabic-speaking children with DLD at various developmental stages. In other words, the child’s language development may influence the default error form. The use of bare stems or imperatives as defaults may represent an earlier developmental stage. Similarly, the prevalent substitution of the masculine inflectional marker for other types of gender and number verb agreement found in the group with DLD can be considered a default form that emerges later in language development.

Indeed, the proportion of nonmorphological substitutions to morphological substitutions distinguished the DLD and TD-LA groups in the present study. The younger TD group displayed a preference for nonmorphological substitutions $n = 2 0$ , $7 6 . 9 \%$ ) over morphological substitutions $( n = 6 , 2 3 . 1 \% )$ ), whereas the group with DLD showed the opposite trend (53 nonmorphological $\left[ 2 5 . 1 \% \right]$ and 158 morphological $\left[ 7 4 . 9 \% \right] .$ ). This could be an indication that the children with DLD who made more errors may be at a lower developmental stage. Longitudinal research would help clarify the current investigation’s findings and validate this conclusion. In future studies, it would also be interesting to examine the pattern of errors in the past versus the present, with a focus on the inflectional complexity of each form.

In summary, Kuwaiti Arabic-speaking children with DLD continued to struggle with certain aspects of verb agreement, a skill that younger language-matched TD children appeared to have mastered. A longitudinal study would establish if these children continue to develop verb morphology at the prolonged rate reported for English (Rice et al. 1995, Rice & Wexler 1996). Even though the younger TD-LA children were proficient with verb inflections, they shared certain characteristics with the DLD group: a) they preferred the masculine inflectional form over the feminine and plural forms in terms of accuracy, and b) they preferred to use the masculine as a substitute when errors were made.

# 4.5. Implications for the explanatory accounts of DLD

Grammatical morphology appears to be a challenge for many children acquiring various languages such as English (Leonard et al. 2017; Souto et al. 2014, Rice & Wexler 1997), Dutch (Blom et al. 2014) and Arabic (e.g., Abdalla & Crago 2008, Fahim 2017). However, as demonstrated in the current study, these children do not display uniform grammatical profiles across all languages, and the types of errors or overgeneralized default forms are dictated by structural characteristics of the ambient language (Paradis & Crago 2001). Thus, the findings of this investigation can shed light on some of the explanatory accounts of DLD discussed in the introduction. Because subject-verb agreement was the focus of this study, the accounts will be examined only from this perspective.

The agreement deficit hypothesis (Clahsen 1989, Clahsen et al. 1997) contends that the source of difficulties in DLD is subject-verb agreement, not tense. The lower accuracy in marking subject-verb agreement as well as the presence of default substitution errors are consistent with the assumptions of this hypothesis. However, it is unclear why one type of verb agreement—the masculine singular gender —fared better if children with DLD lack subject feature paradigms, as this hypothesis asserts. According to this view, children with DLD produce correct subject-verb agreement through rote learning. It is difficult to envision how rote learning could have resulted in the overgeneralization of the masculine agreement forms observed in this study.

Despite their difficulties with verb inflectional morphology, children with DLD in this study exhibited higher subject-verb agreement (masculine) than those reported for children learning English (e.g., Rice & Wexler 1996), a language with limited verb morphology, which supports the morphological richness hypothesis. However, the observation that younger TD-LA children significantly differ in agreement accuracy from the DLD group is inconsistent with the morphological richness hypothesis predictions. The morphological richness account is less advantageous when the morphological complexity of the language exceeds the child’s available processing resources (Leonard 2014). This may explain why the children in this study experienced difficulty with subject-verb agreement given that they have to take into account the fusional nature of Arabic with multiple dimensions for the verb -root pattern, tense, person, gender, and number (see Lukacs et al. 2009 for a similar explanation for Hungarian).

However, the fact that children in this study used default substitutions is contrary to the morphological richness account. Near misses would be expected when the target and error differ by only one feature. Near misses emerged only when 3MS was substituted for 3FS (gender feature was different). Conversely, instances where the imperative 2MS for the 3PL contradict this assumption, as the error varies from the target in multiple features. When children use less marked/underspecified forms as default substitutes, the likelihood of near-miss errors decreases. Additionally, as noted previously, the complexity and multiplicity of Arabic verb morphology may limit near-miss errors.

In sum, the data from this investigation shed light on the explanatory hypotheses that were explored. Each proposal appears to account for certain aspects of this study’s findings, but not others.

# 4.6. Clinical implications

The current study is a valuable addition to the very few available studies on DLD in Kuwaiti Arabic. The fact that the DLD group performed less than the language matched group shows that verb agreement seems to be an issue for these children and should be included in the productive language evaluation tests. Additionally, the fact that the feminine and the plural and not the masculine were discriminating between the TD children and the DLD group as well as among the younger and older TD groups suggests that these specific structures should be the focus of these language tests. An implication for treatment that the results of this study suggest is that error analysis would be helpful to clinicians when choosing the appropriate course of treatment. Even if it is still incorrect, a child who uses a nonmorphological error substitute or a bare stem appears to be less developed than one who has some awareness of verb inflection, as was found in the current study in the frequent use of masculine forms as substitutes.

# 5. Conclusion and limitations

This study was the first to examine verb morphology in Kuwaiti Arabic-speaking children with DLD. Future research on Kuwaiti Arabic could attempt to corroborate and expand the findings of this study using a variety of methodologies. Detailed linguistic research on the Kuwaiti Arabic dialect may provide essential information for further interpreting this investigation’s data. Further research on nominal morphology, which has received less attention, could shed light on agreement in DLD in Arabic and other Semitic languages. A particularly interesting question is determining if the difficulties are limited to only verbal morphology, or whether the same deficits also exist in the nominal domain.

A limitation of this study is the small sample size, which is due to the difficulty in gaining access to children with a comprehensive diagnosis of DLD who meet the eligibility criteria. This is mitigated by the fact that the findings agree with previous studies on other Arabic dialects. Nonetheless, a limited sample size diminishes statistical power, preventing more rigorous parametric statistical analyses and a comprehensive examination of age-related differences. Consequently, future research with a larger sample size is required to confirm some of the findings of the present study. Another drawback is that we focused on subject-verb agreement and not tense. Because agreement and tense are related, future research should include both, even if the emphasis is on one rather than the other. Further investigations should consider using a more balanced set of stimuli since our tasks had slightly fewer masculine forms.

To conclude, the empirical and clinical implications that emerged from this exploratory study of DLD in Kuwaiti Arabic have taught us much. Inflectional morphology poses challenges for Kuwaiti Arabic-speaking children with DLD, resulting in overuse of default substitutions, a prevalent tendency also attested cross-linguistically. This study established that the learner’s language typology dictates which morphosyntactic aspects are susceptible. The group with DLD, like their counterparts acquiring other Arabic dialects, displayed selective difficulties with certain aspects of subject-verb agreement (feminine and plural inflections). Future research will help us gain further insights about the universal and Arabic-specific features of DLD.
