# Abstract

The present study explored the summary writing processes of six first-year MBA (Master of Business Administration) students in a North American university. The participants, three Chinese who speak English as a Second Language (ESL) and three native-English-speaking (NES), each completed a course-related summary task while thinking aloud. The analyses of the think-aloud protocols, retrospective interviews, and written drafts reveal similarities and differences in the writing processes of the participants. Depending on their perceptions of the nature of the writing task, business employment background or related writing experiences, the participants either wrote confidently or struggled through the writing processes, relying to varied degrees on such strategies as verbalizing what is being written, planning content, referring to the sources, reading what has been written, reviewing and modifying one’s writing, and commenting on the source texts. The study highlights the role of students’ previous writing expertise in learning disciplinary writing, the complexity of a course-related assignment in terms of its unclear and inexplicit expectations perceived by students, and the need to identify key strategies for good summary writing across and within disciplines.

# 1. Introduction

Summary writing is important in tertiary education. A substantial portion of university assignments involves summarization of content (e.g. Braine, 1995; Horowitz, 1986; Kirkland & Saunders, 1991). As Freedman and Pringle (1980, p. 314)

state, course-related assignments may ‘‘entail far more intense intellectual engagement’’ beyond the display of writing ability. Students may summarize source texts for their course assignments in certain ways to integrate concepts discussed in the class, to get a better grade, or to meet the expectations of the instructor. Put otherwise, university students need to learn ‘‘specific norms, expectations, and conventions with respect to writing’’ when being acculturated into the discourse community of the discipline (Bhatia, 2002, p. 37). However, little information is available about how students summarize source information in completing their discipline-related course assignments. Most previous studies, as we review below, explored the summarizing processes of first language (L1) and second language (L2) writers using tasks either designed by the researchers or in the context and programs of English for Academic Purposes (EAP). To fill in the gap, the present study describes the writing processes of six first-year MBA students in doing their course-related summary tasks at a Canadian university. The purpose is to understand the writing processes of these students so as to suggest approaches to enhance the summary performance of students, especially those L2 writers.

# 2. Previous studies

There has been an emerging body of L1 research on summary writing in the past twenty years. Many of these studies analyzed and compared students’ summary texts to identify the differences between experienced and inexperienced writers (e.g. Brown & Day, 1983; Johns, 1985; Sherrard, 1986; Winograd, 1984). Using tasks selected or designed by themselves, researchers found that university students outperformed high school and elementary students in their ability to judge and select relevant information (e.g. Brown & Day, 1983; Winograd, 1984), although some of them, as Sherrard (1986) observed, still adhered closely to the sequence of source sentences and mapped them one to one into their summary sentences. In another study, Johns (1985) reported that graduate students and adept freshmen produced a higher percentage of correct combinations of ideas than those under-prepared freshmen. Compared with university students, professional writers in Brown and Day (1983) were found to be more capable of producing a generalization of source information. There is also evidence of an effect of explicit training on how to summarize (e.g. Coffman, 1994; Friend, 2001; Garner & McCaleb, 1985; Hare & Borchardt, 1984). Like elementary and high school students who improved their summaries after training (Coffman, 1994; Hare & Borchardt, 1984), university students produced better summaries after being trained to identify in relevant source texts such textual features as topic sentences, key words (Garner & McCaleb, 1985), repeated ideas expressed in different ways, and generalizations of information at the highest-level (Friend, 2001).

Among L1 studies on the summary writing processes of university students, researchers also used tasks designed by themselves to observe students who were categorized as expert readers doing a summary task (Garner, 1982) or compare their summary strategies with students who were defined as less experienced writers based on their reading ability (Kennedy, 1985). Results show that students who were distinguished as good readers used strategies such as reading carefully for key ideas and details, comparing the text and summary to see if ideas were maintained or deleted appropriately, skimming to get the overall meaning, and substituting general with specific terms (Garner, 1982). Compared with those less experienced, the experienced student writers did more reading and note-taking, and incorporated their notes more efficiently into their summaries (Kennedy, 1985). However, in comparison with the professional writers, students from a community college in Taylor (1984) were found to plan less before writing, read the source texts less carefully for structure and theme, and refer less to the source texts to verify the accuracy of their summaries. In sum, L1 research on the summary writing process suggests that experienced writers use certain strategies more frequently and efficiently than less experienced do.

Compared with L1 research, L2 research on summary writing has focused on EAP training at the undergraduate level. One finding based on limited L2 research concerns how ESL students relied on copying in their summary writing. For example, Moore (1997), as a study skills adviser at an Australian university, found ESL students with an Asian background copied extensively when writing summaries without acknowledging the original author. The researcher attributed this tendency to cultural variations in summarization practice: the ESL students copied because they regarded the original text as a source of information whereas their native-Englishspeaking (NES) peers typically conceived the source text as an individual point of view and would, therefore, attribute the summarized positions to the original author. Compared with Moore (1997), other researchers believed that L2 students relied on copying because of their low language proficiency. Based on an examination of summaries written by 80 ESL undergraduates using an excerpt from a textbook for low–intermediate English for business students, Johns and Mayes (1990) reported that students with low levels of English proficiency copied directly from the original text more frequently than those with high levels of English proficiency. Basham and Rounds (1981) also observed in their Academic Entry English Program that many ESL students altered the tone or intent of the original passages when they tried to modify source sentences in their summaries. In addition, Campbell (1990) reported that ESL students received significantly lower holistic scores than NES students in a study that compared summaries of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { E S L }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { N E S }$ undergraduates in a university composition course. Unsure of their ability to paraphrase, L2 student writers, as research has indicated, typically rely on copying when writing from source texts (e.g. Campbell, 1990; Currie, 1998). To overcome copying or plagiarism, as Braine (1995) suggests, L2 students need to learn how to paraphrase in their summary writing.

A second finding of research on L2 summary writing concerns the role of L1 literacy in summary writing. Cumming (1989), and Cumming, Rebuffot, and Ledwell (1989) observed that L1 writing expertise affects the summary writing processes of L2 undergraduates. Participants in both studies were identified with three levels of writing expertise in their L1 (experienced, average, and basic) and two levels of L2 proficiency (intermediate and advanced). The 23 Francophone students in Cumming (1989) wrote summaries (as well as an informal letter and an expository argument) in English whereas the 14 Anglophone students in Cumming et al. (1989) wrote summaries in both English and French. Based on ratings of the essays and participants’ various decision-making strategies, the researchers found that L1 writing expertise was a major factor that influenced the qualities of both the written products and the writing processes. The less expert L1 writers focused mainly in both their L1 and L2 summaries on a verbatim representation of the original texts and planned only what to write next whereas the expert writers shifted their attention between local wording and planning of overall gist (Cumming et al., 1989). L2 writers with low levels of L1 literacy expertise also tended to focus more on single aspects of writing when making decisions than those with high levels of L1 writing expertise, who attended to multiple aspects of their writing while summarizing source texts (Cumming, 1989). These results suggest that writing expertise is transferable across languages. L2 writers who are experienced L1 writers tend to use summary strategies more efficiently than those with limited L1 writing expertise.

A third finding of research on L2 summary writing concerns the importance of critical uses of summarized source materials in academic and professional writing. Following Flower (1990), Belcher (1995, p. 136) states that students should respond to source texts critically, ‘‘not just summarizing what they have read, but entering into dialogue with their subject-area reading.’’ Arguing in the same vein, Allison, Berry, and Lewkowicz (1994) challenged the typical school-like expectation for summary writing to cover all main points, arguing that summaries in academic and professional writing should involve selective and critical analysis. Based on their studies on the content of English summaries written by 80 undergraduates of economics in their EAP classes at the University of Hong Kong, Allison et al. (1994, 1995a, 1995b) reported that a mediating activity such as oral group discussion not only helped students rely less on direct copying but also select topics related to their personal experiences and interests. The importance of a reflective and critical interaction with the content of the source is also the focus of two studies that observed how MBA students completed course assignments that required them to write summaries based on business case readings (Connor & Kramer, 1995; Raymond & Parks, 2002). Based on interviews with 18 MBA students with a Chinese background, Raymond and Parks (2002) reported that most participants were engaged in analyzing business cases critically by applying conceptual knowledge they learned from lectures and course readings. In another study, Connor and Kramer (1995) observed differences in how two NES and three ESL MBA students used critical thinking and creative problem solving in summarizing and analyzing a business case. Two students, one NES student and the ESL student with the highest TOEFL score (637), were recognized as efficient summarizers who took notes, underlined key points, and made an outline while reading the case. Compared with others who offered no challenges or coherent and strong argument as they summarized case ideas, the two students produced their summaries to either transform the case into a sound management decision or interpret the source information to draw new conclusions. A critical approach appears to be the key in summarizing disciplinary texts.

In sum, research has suggested that while experienced L1 writers use certain summary strategies more frequently and efficiently than those who are less experienced (e.g. Garner, 1982; Kennedy, 1985; Taylor, 1984), L2 students with a higher L2 language proficiency or L1 writing expertise produce better summaries and use certain strategies more frequently and efficiently than those with low language proficiency or writing expertise (e.g. Cumming, 1989; Cumming et al., 1989; Johns & Mayes, 1990). Apart from language proficiency and writing expertise, other factors such as critical selection and evaluation of source information (Allison et al., 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Connor & Kramer, 1995; Raymond & Parks, 2002) and the writer’s cultural background in summarization practice (Moore, 1997) are also found to influence the quality of students’ summary writing for academic purposes. Most of the previous studies (except Connor & Kramer, 1995; Raymond & Parks, 2002), however, focused on undergraduate students using tasks that are not specifically discipline-related. As Hirvela (1997) points out, students, especially those at the graduate level, may find it difficult to identify expectations and practices within specific discourse community. In other words, they might encounter special challenges in doing disciplinary course-related summary tasks. To address this issue, the present study was designed to explore the writing processes and strategies used by six first-year graduate students doing their summary tasks for an MBA course. Comparing the writing processes and strategies of three ESL and three NES students, we addressed the following research questions:

How do individual ESL and NES MBA students write summaries for their course assignments?   
Can their various uses of writing strategies be traced to the participants’ language backgrounds, previous writing experiences, and perceptions of the nature of the task?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Participants

The six participants, motivated by the opportunity to do think-aloud composing and learn about their own writing, were volunteers from first-year MBA students enrolled in a 6-week course called Buyer Behavior (26 February–4 April 2001) at a university in western Canada. The three ESL participants were solicited through an e-mail message sent via the university list server for Chinese students. The three NES students in the same course were then recommended by the Chinese participants to form a comparison group. Table 1 presents the profiles of the six participants based on a background questionnaire. For convenience, the three Chinese students were all given pseudonyms beginning with ‘Ch’ as in Chin, Chong, and Chen whereas the three NES students were all given pseudonyms beginning with ‘E’ as in Emma, Elizabeth, and Elaine.

As Table 1 shows, all participants were between the age of 26 and 30 with the exception of Chong who was slightly older. Two students (Chin and Elizabeth) had BA degrees, two (Chen and Elaine) had BSc degrees, and two (Chong and Emma) already had master degrees in either Arts or Science. All participants had about 2–5 years of working experiences. Except Emma who worked as an Arts conservator and Elaine as an occupational therapist, the other four participants all had experiences of business management and marketing. At the time of data collection, the three Chinese participants had all been in Canada for less than a year. Prior to coming to Canada, they had learnt English for 10 years and had TOEFL scores of over 600. Compared with Chong and Chen who were science majors with limited experience in writing academic papers, Chin learned to write English papers in her first year as an English major and had published for Chinese newspapers and English newsletters at work. Like Chin, the three NES students all had extensive writing experiences at work. For example, Elizabeth wrote case reports and prepared marketing documents first as a sales supporter and then as a marketing manager; Emma wrote lab reports as an arts conservator; and Elaine, as an occupational therapist, wrote health reports for her clients. This background information, as we analyze later, shed light on how these individual students processed the writing tasks.

# 3.2. Writing tasks

Two written assignments in the course Buyer Behavior were used for the present study.1 Both assignments involved a case reading of a company that conducted a market research study to improve its product: one was a 34-page case study from DeBruicker and Ward (1980) on Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. that experienced an apparent decline in its sales of cranberry sauce; and the other was a 9-page case study from Blackwell, Engel, and Talarzyk (1977) on Libb Pharmaceuticals, a company that had a decline in its market share of a toothpaste product. Each assignment required students to write, in two double-space pages, a summary and examination of the relevant buyer behaviors followed by recommendations and implications for marketing strategies. Based on the availability of the participants to complete one of the assignments while thinking aloud, Chin and Emma did the assignment on Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., and the rest did the assignment on Libb Pharmaceuticals. (See Appendix A for a writing sample.)

# 3.3. Data collection

Apart from written drafts, both think-aloud protocols and retrospective interviews were used to generate data on and insights into the participants’ writing processes. Each participant, after having read the case and taken notes about the reading if necessary, met with the first author individually and received think-aloud training for about $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ following procedures in Ericsson and Simon (1993). They were instructed to verbalize everything that went through their minds in the thinking language whether it was their first or second language. After the short training, the researcher left the room while the participants thought aloud as they wrote the assignments on the computer with the presence of the case reading and their notes. A note reminding the writers to keep talking was put in front of them. When finished writing, the participants handed in a disk copy of the initial draft and were interviewed about how they processed the writing tasks. They were asked to recall the writing strategies they used and to comment on whether any of these strategies were related to their previous writing experiences. Since prewriting reading along with note-taking and synthesizing ideas was crucial in how students summarized the given case, we also asked the participants to talk about their preparations and their understanding of the nature of the task. Students’ final drafts with the instructor’s grades were also collected when available to help interpret the data.

All the six think-aloud protocols (about $6 7 { - } 9 0 \ \operatorname { m i n }$ each) and the retrospective interviews (about $1 5 { - } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ each) were audio taped. While the interviews were all transcribed, we only transcribed the verbalizations of participants’ writing processes for summarizing and analyzing the cases (about $3 3 { - } 7 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ each). Apart from an intention to focus on the summarization processes, we, following Connor and Kramer (1995), believed that the written drafts and interview data were sufficient to explain how participants used their summaries and analyses to offer solutions in the final part of the report. We were also aware that think-aloud protocols of the reading process could have been collected to compare whether individual writers used different strategies during and after their text-reading and note-taking. However, in our initial contact with the participants, we learnt that they all planned to read the case and discuss it with other students over a few days while thinking and planning for the task. We, therefore, did not interrupt the preferred practice and ask the participants to read and plan in one sitting while thinking aloud.

# 3.4. Coding of the think-aloud protocols

We developed a coding scheme with four major categories to analyze the thinkaloud protocols. Three of the categories—planning, composing and editing—followed the Hayes–Flower model of cognitive processes of writing (Hayes & Flower, 1980) and the fourth category commenting was created to cover the relevant behaviors of the participating students. Each of these major categories was further distinguished into several writing behaviors or specific strategies for a total of 18 coding items. First, the category of planning was subcategorized into five strategies including (1) ‘‘planning for organization,’’ (2) ‘‘planning for content,’’ (3) ‘‘planning for text format using word processing tools,’’ (4) ‘‘planning for word or sentence choices,’’ and (5) ‘‘reviewing task requirements while planning what to write.’’ Second, the category of composing was distinguished into another five subcategories to indicate how participants tried to put ideas into words such as (6) ‘‘referring to source readings,’’ (7) ‘‘reading what has been written,’’ (8) ‘‘verbalizing what is being written,’’ (9) ‘‘explaining why something has been written,’’ and (10) ‘‘using a dictionary to check word meaning.’’ Third, the category of editing distinguished strategies of (11) ‘‘summarizing,’’ (12) ‘‘reviewing,’’ (13) ‘‘evaluating,’’ and (14) ‘‘modifying’’ what has been written. Fourth, the category of commenting distinguished strategies of commenting on (15) ‘‘the course,’’ (16) ‘‘the assignment,’’ (17) ‘‘the source texts,’’ and (18) ‘‘the writer’s own performance.’’ Finally, an additional category was created for a small number of comments unrelated to the writing task. (See Appendix B for definitions and examples of the coding scheme.)

One of the six protocols was randomly selected to check inter-coder reliability. The first author and a research assistant (a graduate student in the area of L2 education) independently segmented the selected sample into units and numbered these units in the order of their occurrences. Each unit was distinguished by mention of a strategy in the utterance(s). They then coded each segment only once in terms of the 18 strategies and reached an agreement of $91 \%$ . At this point, the rest of the verbal data were segmented and coded using the QSR NUD\*IST 4.0, a computer software system for qualitative data analyses. Based on the coding reports, we tallied the number of words coded under each strategy for each participant and then calculated the percentage of these words out of the total words in each think-aloud protocol. These percentages, characterizing the frequencies and amount of using various strategies, were used to compare how individual students completed the summary tasks.

# 4. Findings and discussion

Table 2 presents the percentages of words in each think-aloud protocol that feature how the six participants used various strategies in summarizing the case readings. As the table shows, 11 of the 18 strategies were infrequently used and had an average below $2 . 5 \%$ . The most frequently observed behavior was ‘‘verbalizing what is being written’’ $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 2 9 . 1 1 \% )$ , which could be an artifact of think-aloud data collecting procedure. The next most frequently used strategy was ‘‘planning content’’ ( $\mathrm { n e a n } = 1 4 . 4 6 \%$ ), followed by ‘‘referring to the sources’’ $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 1 1 . 4 9 \%$ ), ‘‘reading what has been written’’ (mean $= 1 0 . 7 8 \%$ ), ‘‘reviewing one’s written text’’ (mean $= 9 . 2 7 \%$ ), ‘‘modifying one’s written texts’’ (mean $= 5 . 3 1 \%$ ), and ‘‘commenting on the sources’’ (mean $= 3 . 8 9 \%$ ). In this study, we focus on these more frequently used strategies to identify individual tendencies among the six participants and, at the same time, compare these tendencies both within and across the ESL and NES groups. Participants’ written drafts and interview comments were used to help interpret how each student approached and completed the assignment.

Chen: ‘‘If I have ideas, I’m fine.’’

With the highest TOEFL score (640) among the three Chinese participants, Chen was confident in doing the assignment. He said he always had good ideas though he might lack good expressions and spend longer time in completing an assignment compared with his NES peers. As Chen commented in the interview, ‘‘I think the most important thing [in academic writing] is content and thinking. If I have ideas, I’m fine.’’ The fact that Chen had little problem in generating ideas was confirmed in his think-aloud protocol. Summarizing his writing process, Fig. 1 shows that Chen primarily ‘‘verbalized what was being written’’ ( $\mathrm { n e a n } = 4 5 . 4 4 \%$ ) and ‘‘read what had been written’’ (mean $= 3 6 . 2 0 \%$ ). His infrequent use of other strategies suggests that while relying mainly on reading to keep the flow of thought, Chen did not appear to lack ideas; nor did he seem to have any problems putting ideas into words.

To illustrate this tendency, the following excerpt is from Chen’s think-aloud protocol when he was composing the sentence, ‘‘As a leading player in the toothpaste industry, $L P$ held a portion of the market share, but the recent decline of Alive’s market share really concerns the management’’. (Angle brackets indicate reading what has been written, double quotation marks indicate verbalization of what is being written, and the dashes that separate the letters indicate spelling of the word.) Excerpt from Chen’s protocol (Unit 7–10):

The above excerpt illustrates how Chen typically moved between reading what he had written and verbalizing what he was writing. There was little planning in the entire writing process. We found from the retrospective interview that Chen actually did careful planning prior to writing. Having read the requirements carefully, taken notes, and made an outline when reading the case, Chen said he only had to focus on composing during the actual writing process. In the interview, Chen talked about how he planned and wrote to focus on the key issues without a straight summary of the case: ‘‘I analyzed the case and found some major causes for the decline in marketing. Then I gave my recommendations. It’s very simple.’’ Like two of the MBA students in Connor and Kramer (1995), Chen turned the case materials into an argument for the company to change their marketing strategy by targeting at young people and promoting their toothpaste product as the most effective for decay prevention and whitening teeth. As a result, the recommendation section in Chen’s paper was only a brief reinforcement of the argument. Such an analytical approach reflects Chen’s interpretation of the nature of the assignment which was, in the writer’s own words, not just a case summary but ‘‘to apply the knowledge [buyer behavior principles] provided by the textbook.’’ Echoing the MBA students in Raymond and Parks (2002), Chen viewed the assignment as an application of the conceptual knowledge privileged in the course.

Chen attributed his efficient planning strategies and ability to analyze business cases to his experience and organization skills as a general manager of a large company. He believed that his business background helped him understand concepts and generate ideas. To him, content or ideas, rather than the English language, were the most important for course assignments. Proud of his business background, Chen was confident in writing his MBA course assignments, ‘‘You just write and get feedback. Then you improve.’’ Chen got eight out of 10 for his assignment from the instructor, a high mark that must have reinforced his self-confidence. Chen’s experience suggests that in order to write academic papers, students must have confidence to see or imagine themselves as experts or, as Bartholomae (1985) put it, privileged ‘‘insiders.’’

Elaine: ‘‘Uh, it’s painful.’’

Compared with Chen who was confident in writing the assignment, Elaine, though a native English speaker, expressed her frustration in doing the assignment. ‘‘Uh, it’s painful,’’ she sighed and complained (Elaine’s protocol, Unit 111). Elaine’s struggle to generate content was shown when she checked the length of her writing a couple of times as if she was forcing herself to produce sentences to meet the length requirement. Elaine’s writing process was summarized in Fig. 2 which shows that Elaine ‘‘read what she had written’’ (mean $= 1 5 . 2 3 \%$ ) and ‘‘verbalized what she was writing’’ (mean $= 2 2 . 4 5 \%$ ) much less than Chen did $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 3 6 . 2 0 \%$ and $4 5 . 4 4 \%$ respectively). Along with these two strategies, Elaine ‘‘referred to the source texts’’ (mean $= 1 3 . 3 2 \%$ ) and ‘‘planned what to write’’ (mean $= 1 3 . 1 3 \%$ ) frequently as she struggled to generate ideas.

For example, the following excerpt is from Elaine’s think-aloud protocol as she wrote the sentence: ‘‘Michael Leason, the director of marketing research at Libb Pharmeceuticals, had chosen to use a basic attitude model to predict individual brand preference.’’ (The curly brackets indicate reading of the source text.)

Reading one’s written text

Referring to the sources

The above excerpt shows how Elaine planned and referred to the sources about the attitude model used by the director of marketing research at Libb Pharmaceuticals as she read and verbalized her writing. Like Chen, Elaine said she also made an outline and took notes as she read the case before writing. However, although both planned carefully while reading the text before writing, Chen seemed to be able to follow his outline while making few local plans during writing whereas Elaine continued planning as she searched information from the source text and her notes frequently during the entire writing process. As Elaine herself recalled during the retrospective interview, ‘‘I looked at the article every once in a while to get information and I referred to my notes a couple of times.’’ Compared with those experienced writers in previous studies who were reported to plan and refer to the sources frequently during the summarizing processes (Connor & Kramer, 1995; Cumming, 1989; Cumming et al., 1989; Garner, 1982; Kennedy, 1985; Taylor, 1984), Elaine relied on these strategies to survive the ‘‘painful’’ writing process.

Elaine explained that she struggled through the writing process because she was concerned about how her work might be graded. To make sure that she covered all the required elements, Elaine used headings to guide the reader from an introduction of the ‘‘issue’’ about the decline of the market share of Libb Pharmaceuticals, then an ‘‘analysis’’ of the company’s limited effort to concentrate on any specific target population, and finally ‘‘recommendations’’ and ‘‘implications’’ for the company to promote its product to attract both lower and higher educated people. Like Chen, Elaine believed that the assignment was ‘‘a summary analysis.’’ She distinguished school-like summary tasks from summary analysis in business case report: ‘‘To me, summary writing [in school] means to rewrite with the exact content. You learn how to do that in high school and English writing classes. But when you run an opinion [in the case of analysis assignment], that’s not the same summary.’’ Elaine’s comments echo Allison et al.’s (1994) argument for a critical approach in professional summary writing. Such a critical approach, as Carson (2001) points out, is more important at the graduate level. Using a critical and professional approach to write the business case analysis, Elaine was, however, uncertain over what was expected from the instructor. As she received only six out of 10 from the instructor for her previous case report, Elaine complained ‘‘uh, this assignment, hard to understand what they want from us’’ (Elaine’s protocol, Unit 24). Elaine’s distinction between the professional approach versus the expectations of the university or individual instructor confirms Lea and Street’s (1999) observation of various levels of task specifications and demands for university assignments.

Elaine’s attention to meeting the instructor’s expectations must have paid off as she, like Chen, got eight out of 10 for this assignment. Compared with Chen, Elaine’s lack of confidence did not seem to match her 4-year experience of report writing as an occupational therapist. As Elaine explained, her previous writing experiences were different from what she was required to do for business case analysis. Observing how students complete course related assignments, the present study suggests that discipline-related working experiences seem to play an important role in how students complete their MBA course-related summary tasks. Depending whether they have relevant experiences of business case analysis, students might approach their assignments either confidently as Chen did or painfully as Elaine did.

Chin and Elizabeth: ‘‘I can always improve; but I am reasonably satisfied.’’

Chin and Elizabeth were the two participants who had extensive L2 learning backgrounds. Both believed that they were efficient language learners and good English writers. Chin had extensive training in general English writing as an English major, whereas Elizabeth used French and Japanese, apart from English, as her working languages when she worked in Japan. Chin said she had obtained either an A or A plus for all the assignments since she was enrolled in the MBA program. Elizabeth, also confident in doing her course work, spent the least time (about 67 min compared to an average of $7 8 \ \mathrm { m i n } ,$ ) on the assignment used for the present study. ‘‘I think’’, Elizabeth said as she revealed her satisfaction in the retrospective interview, ‘‘I can always improve; but I am reasonably satisfied.’’

Fig. 3 shows similar tendencies in how Chin and Elizabeth processed their writing tasks, though the former wrote in L2 and the latter in L1. Like Elaine, both writers ‘‘verbalized what was being written’’ (mean $= 3 2 . 5 3 $ and $3 8 . 4 4 \%$ respectively) and used two other strategies: ‘‘planning content’’ (mean $= 2 4 . 0 7$ and $1 8 . 8 6 \%$ respectively), and ‘‘referring to sources’’ (mean $= 1 3 . 1 1$ and $2 0 . 7 8 \%$ respectively). Of the six participants, Chin and Elizabeth planned content the most and they also each had the highest frequency of referring to the sources in the ESL and NES groups respectively.

To illustrate the writing processes of the two participants, the following excerpt is from the think-aloud protocol of Chin as she was composing the sentence: ‘‘Most consumers associated Cranberry Sauce with tradition and festivals like Thanksgiving, Christmas and Turkeys’’.

Referring to sources

Verbalizing what is being written

The above example illustrates how Chin carefully planned what to write about the value and belief of consumers and, at the same time, referring to the case reading for western values related to cranberry sauce. Like Chin, Elizabeth referred to the source text frequently before she put her ideas into words. Compared with Chin, Elizabeth also made more comments on the source information. In fact, the percentage of Elizabeth’s references of and comments on the sources topped the whole group (mean $= 2 0 . 7 8$ and $1 3 . 9 9 \%$ respectively). Different from Elaine who was not sure about the task requirements, Chin and Elizabeth both appeared to know what was expected as they made and followed an outline for the assignment efficiently. ‘‘Because the article is written about research and full of tables,’’ as Elizabeth described how she selected information in planning her summary, ‘‘so I first look at all the written part. And you know probably five sentences are the key points.’’ Also planned carefully before writing, Chin said, ‘‘I kept referring to the outline so that I could keep the structure.’’

Like Chen and Elaine, Chin also merged her summary and analysis of the case materials. The first part of Chin’s draft was marked with subheadings summarizing and analyzing the case of Ocean Spray Cranberry in terms of the different ‘‘values/ beliefs’’ of consumers, limited ‘‘exposure’’ of the product, and different ‘‘needs/lifestyles’’ of potential users of the product. Chin must have carefully selected these points as she went on to recommend that the company recognize different consumption needs, focus on product attributes that consumers value, create more exposure to the product, and use advertisements and pricing strategies to promote the product. In contrast with Chin, Elizabeth actually started her case report with a ‘‘background’’ summary about the market decline of Libb Pharmaceutical, the position of its toothpaste as an all-in-one mouth care product, and the company’s consumer survey. Following the summary, Elizabeth moved on to an ‘‘analysis’’, illustrating that most consumers of the product were lower educated people who ranked taste/flavor as the product’s most important attribute. With this analysis, Elizabeth recommended that the company emphasize not only fresh breath but also decay prevention in promoting its toothpaste product to attract the educated population. Elizabeth explained how she wrote the case report, stressing the importance of summarizing the right information, ‘‘You always first summarize the case. You then do the analysis and make recommendations. Summary is important because you can make the correct recommendations.’’

Chin and Elizabeth both received higher marks (nine out of 10) on their assignments than the other four participants did. The successful writing performance of the two participants appeared to be related to their experiences of business writing in their previous employment. Compared with Chin who was the only Chinese participant that had published in English newsletters as a market researcher, Elizabeth was the only NES participant who wrote many business reports as a sales supporter and prepared marketing documents as a marketing manager. In contrast with Elaine who did not benefit from her previous writing experience unrelated to business case reports, Elizabeth, in particular, attributed her writing expertise to her previous business writing experiences. Connecting her professional and university writing experiences, Elizabeth commented on how she wrote the assignment, ‘‘That’s the format I follow in work and school and in almost every case study I do.’’

Chong and Emma: ‘‘You should write what you can get a grade from.’’

Compared with Chin and Elizabeth, Chong and Emma, like Elaine, worked hard to meet the expectations of the course instructor. As Chong put it bluntly during the interview, ‘‘you should write more about the things that you can get a grade from. I mean . . . try to write an assignment that the professor likes.’’ Also trying hard to satisfy the course instructor, Emma complained that requirements of the assignment were not clearly stated, ‘‘I am not sure if I answered the question, because I don’t understand the question they are asking.’’ Like the students observed in previous research (Bartholomae, 1985; Raymond & Parks, 2002), Chong and Emma wrote the assignment by trying to know what the instructor knew and by trying to write what the instructor would write. Not only did they have the same concerns, Chong and Emma, as Fig. 4 illustrates, shared similar uses of strategies in their writing processes. The less steep lines in Fig. 4 (compared to Figs. 1 and 3) suggest that, compared with those of other participants, the strategies used by both Chong and Emma were more evenly distributed among five strategies: ‘‘planning content’’ (mean $= 1 3 . 5 4$ and $1 4 . 4 8 \%$ respectively), ‘‘referring to sources’’ (mean $= 1 0 . 8 5$ and $1 0 . 9 0 \%$ respectively), ‘‘verbalizing one’s writing’’ (mean $= 1 4 . 6 3$ and $2 1 . 1 5 \%$ repetitively), ‘‘reviewing one’s written text’’ $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 1 5 . 6 0 $ and $1 8 . 4 6 \%$ repetitively), and ‘‘modifying one’s written text’’ (mean $= 1 1 . 8 9$ and $8 . 3 0 \%$ respectively). To illustrate how the two writers used these strategies, the following is an excerpt from Emma’s thinkaloud protocol that records how she wrote the text: ‘‘In the late $1 9 6 0 ^ { \prime } s$ this corporation had experienced a decline in their sales of cranberry sauce. Due to these events and consumers’ attitudes / buyer behavior a survey was developed and implemented to examine the managerial issue of repositioning Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc.’s cranberry sauce.’’

Reviewing one’s written text let’s read this. $< . . .$ In the 1960, they experienced a decline on sales. Due to these events the consumers’ survey dealt with these events . . . > ,

In the above excerpt, Emma reviewed and modified her sentences as she planned and verbalized her summary about the consumer survey on cranberry sauce, and referred to the source reading for details of what the company had experienced. As in the above example, she tended to modify each sentence while she was composing it and then review several sentences together before moving on. Like Emma, Chong also edited his writing frequently. The attention of Emma and Chong to the editing process supports previous findings that the experienced writers tended to evaluate and revise their writings frequently during their writing processes (e.g. Connor & Kramer, 1995; Taylor, 1984; Zamel, 1983).

Though using similar strategies to Emma, Chong, as a L2 writer, resorted to his L1 for planning and generating ideas. He switched frequently between English and Chinese while thinking aloud. Even when referring to the sources, Chong sometimes translated part of the source sentences into Chinese to facilitate his thinking process. In the interview, Chong explained that he preferred to think in Chinese because he could use more efficiently his logical thinking skills developed from his Chinese writing. Previous researchers have also reported that many L2 writers resort to their L1 in planning what to write (e.g. Cumming, 1989; Cumming et al., 1989; Lay, 1982; Qi, 1998). For example, a Chinese ESL participant in Qi (1998) frequently switched between English and Chinese while completing writing tasks in English. Consistent with these observations, the case of Chong indicates that some L2 writers resort to their L1 for sophisticated thinking in the development of content and organization.

Like Elizabeth, Chong and Emma also followed the pattern of summary–analysis–recommendation in their case reports. Chong first summarized findings of Libb Pharmaceuticals’ customer survey, then analyzed how the company had unstrategically emphasized every attribute of the toothpaste product, and finally recommended that the company target young consumers with low income and also emphasize the function of decay prevention, the most important factor influencing purchasing decisions. Similarly, Emma started her paper with a summary of various findings of the customer survey about the product of cranberry sauce. She then analyzed the case to indicate that most consumers bought the cranberry sauce only during the holiday seasons and, therefore, recommended repositioning the product by changing the consumer perception so they would buy it year round. Both Chong and Emma explained that they analyzed the cases to apply what they had learnt in class. As Emma thought aloud in the above excerpt, ‘‘I’m integrating it into the course, hopefully this is . . .Ok.’’ Similarly, Chong said in the interview, ‘‘We have to apply what we have learned. . . . I try to find a way to apply [some] buzz words to the case.’’ Compared with Emma who complained that the criteria of the task were not clearly articulated, Chong said he knew what was expected but did not like it: ‘‘I read the cases and I have to say that I don’t like them at all. I have my own opinion and I have my own way of thinking. But I can’t apply my way to the MBA program because the program told you that you should be like this and that. I have to follow their instructions. Otherwise you cannot get an A plus. I have to force myself to think the way they ask me to think.’’ Instead of challenging the task when encountering perspectives against his own, Chong silenced his voice for a better mark. As Casanave (1995) has observed, it is difficult for students, especially L2 students, to challenge the established course content.

It is perhaps with a pressure to meet the task requirements that both Emma and Chong, like Elaine, found writing the assignment difficult. Being forced to write in a way he disliked, Chong complained, ‘‘uh now I am thinking this is hard to write’’ (Chong’s protocol, Unit 82). In addition, Chong self-evaluated his English level as intermediate and believed that his limited English proficiency made it more difficult for him to express himself than his classmates. Chong might not believe that Emma, his NES peer, also shared his frustration in the composing process, ‘‘uh, it’s more difficult than I thought it is going to be’’. (Emma’s protocol, Unit 6) Emma said that summarizing business cases was a new challenge for her though she had extensive writing experience at work and published papers in some science journals before becoming an MBA candidate. Like Elaine, Emma said that her previous experiences of writing lab reports helped very little as they were all based on her own experiments rather than source readings. The irrelevance of Elaine and Emma’ previous writing experiences suggests that certain aspects of writing expertise are not transferable across disciplines. The cases of Chong and Emma, together with that of Elaine, indicate that both ESL and NES students need to learn to write for their specific subject-related courses. However, as a result of their hard work, both Chong and Emma also got eight out of 10 for their assignments.

# 5. Summary and implications

This study described six MBA students’ uses of strategies to complete courserelated summary tasks and explored how these composing strategies related to the participants’ previous working and writing experiences. For example, Chen’s business management background seemed to help him understand and generate ideas as he wrote confidently, relying mainly on reading what he had written to keep the flow of his thoughts. Compared with Chen, the other five participants all planned content and searched information from sources frequently during their writing. Elaine, for instance, focused on the two strategies as she struggled to generate ideas. Compared with Elaine, Chin and Elizabeth planned content and referred to the sources confidently and attributed their writing behaviors to their previous experiences of L2 learning and business writing. Differing from the above participants, Chong and Emma reviewed and modified their writing most frequently. Chong was also the only Chinese participant who thought aloud in his L1 as he relied on his thinking skills and writing expertise developed in Chinese. Based on their previous relevant working or writing experiences, Chen, Chin, and Elizabeth appeared to be more confident in doing their assignments than Chong, Elaine, and Emma. The study highlights the role of students’ previous writing expertise in learning disciplinary writing.

The writing experiences of the participating students were not merely cognitive but also social processes of learning to become members of the discourse community. Summarizing the case readings as part of the required assignments for the course Buyer Behavior, the six first-year MBA candidates were all concerned about how to fulfill the task specifications they perceived, each trying hard to either follow the professional standard they believed in, or apply the textbook knowledge they learnt, or meet the instructor’s expectations as far as they could guess them. Among the participants, Chen, Elaine and Chin merged their summaries and analyses of the case situations to argue for better marketing strategies; whereas Elizabeth, Chong and Emma all included a summary of relevant information before analyzing it and making recommendations. Comparisons of the written drafts illustrate that each student had focused on different aspects of the case materials, which consequently lead to slightly different recommendations (See Appendix C for key analyses and recommendations in the six case reports). Chen explained that he analyzed the case to apply textbook knowledge of buyer behavior principles whereas Elaine believed she was following the professional model of case analysis. In comparison, Chin and Elizabeth wrote the assignment confidently because they believed they knew what was expected by the instructor; whereas Emma tried to interpret the criteria hoping that she was on the right track. Differing from the above participants, Chong was forced to analyze the case in a way that was against his value system in order to get a better mark. Compared with previous findings about how L2 undergraduates tend to copy in writing summaries, the present study suggests that advanced L1 and L2 writers at the graduate level are engaged in critical selection and analysis of source information when summarizing disciplinary texts. The present study demonstrates the complexity of a course assignment in terms of its unclear task specifications and the underlying writing models students choose to follow and the reasons behind their choices.

The unclear expectations of a discipline-related writing task observed in the present study were consistent with Lea and Street’s (1999) speculation that university task requirements are complex, drawing on different models based on the particular institution, the disciplinary content, and the individual instructor. The pluralized writing experiences of the participating L1 and L2 student academic writers appear more complex than the general notion of L1 writing expertise or a general pedagogic orientation towards disciplinary writing can fully capture. An implication for teaching is to encourage open discussions on the task specifications and different writing models in relation to a course assignment. Such discussions not only can help the instructors reflect critically on the task requirements but also can help students compare various writing models and, therefore, make informed decisions about which model is appropriate for the purposes of disciplinary learning. Research needs to explore whether there is a best model for all or each student, or whether the searching for the best model is itself the learning experience that all graduate students need.

Despite the differences in what aspects students selected and how they analyzed case situations, the present study identified common writing processes and strategies such as planning, composing, editing, and commenting in business case writing of the participating MBA students. This observation confirms previous observations of similar writing performances between experienced L2 writers and their L1 counterparts (e.g. Connor & Kramer, 1995; Cumming, 1989; Cumming et al., 1989; Zamel, 1983). Future studies need to compare various student groups to confirm whether these strategies are typically associated with good writers such as the MBA candidates participating in this research. Research also needs to investigate whether these strategies and processes also apply to other disciplinary writing, and if so, what special skills students need to possess to produce the best products in the most efficient way for various disciplinary writing. To help practice a genre such as business case analysis, one effective teaching tool might be thinking-aloud. As the present study shows, a student’s think-aloud protocol may work like a mirror through which students as well as teachers can examine and understand how the individual writer completes the writing task. We suggest that interested researchers investigate how teachers can demonstrate successful writing of case reports in class using thinking aloud. Empirical evidence is needed to illustrate how students can learn to use certain writing strategies more efficiently by examining and following the teacher’s as well as other students’ writing processes.

# Appendix A. Chin’s final draft of Case Analysis of Ocean Spray Cranberry Inc.a

I. Buyer Behavior issues:

In the OSC case buyer behavior issues are mainly revealed through consumers’ perception of the brand image and attributes of Cranberry Sauce. The differences of their perception are based on their psychographics characteristics and their age and social class, to be specific, their values or beliefs, needs, personalities, lifestyle and MAO effort.

# 1.1. Brand Image

Research showed that Cranberry Sauce (CS) brand name is almost a household word and the brand is well-known and accepted.

# 1.2. Product attributes perception Values/Beliefs

The different needs and values held by different consumers decide their attitudes towards CS’s attributes and their usage/consumption patterns. Most consumers associate CS with tradition and holidays. Most of the heavy users of CS are ‘‘family centered’’ and they tend to have high frequency usage and they use both two types. Some customers value time as very important factors in their life regard CS as convenient to serve and only use Jelly type. But others have contrast view and perceive CS as time-consuming. Certain group of consumers prioritizes family members’ attitudes and rejected CS because of the taste. Most of the consumers are health conscious and regard ‘‘nutritious and with vitamin’’ as very important product attributes and stated that CS can’t fully satisfy this requirement.

Exposure

Some consumers mentioned if they could be reminded of purchasing CS, they would buy it and consumer it. So it indicates the current consumers don’t have sufficient exposure to CS and it may be one of the reason for sales decline.

Needs/Lifestyle

Besides the different perceptions of CS in meeting consumers’ functional needs, it is viewed by certain group to meet hedonic needs. Some consumers use it more as decorations than as a part of a meal. With the difference in consumers’ needs and lifestyles, the research found that CS consumers could be categorized as heavy users, light users and non-users. Among heavy users it could be further categorized as three different types: convenience oriented’’, ‘‘Enthusiastic cooker’’ and ‘‘Decorators’’.

# MAO Effort

Light and non-use consumers tend to have lower MAO effort and are disinterested in CS due to the taste or other reasons. Research showed this category is not likely to change their attitudes towards CS, either because they just don’t like the taste or they are not motivated to process the product information.

II. Implications for marketing strategies

In this case consumers’ values and needs greatly influenced their perception of the CS brand and product, which in turn have the most important implication for Marketing Strategy. The implication was revealed in several marketing areas:

Consumption/usage patterns—Market segmentation

Consumers tend to use CS in a manner consistent with their values and attitudes towards product attributes, which in turn influenced their usage pattern. Recognizing different consumption needs, marketers can have a better idea what features to emphasize as buying incentives in the communication strategies and segment the market based on different needs, the consumption pattern and the values consumers held.

Product feature enhancement

Marketers could feature on the product attributes that consumers think highly of. For example, marketers should change consumers’ misperception of ‘‘time-consuming’’ feature and innutritious aspect.

Positioning and brand image

Current CS consumers don’t have sufficient information about the product and their knowledge of the product use is also limited, marketers could build on their current ‘‘schemas’’ and create interest and motive consumers to process more information and provide more opportunity.

Promotion Strategy

Current CS consumption pattern is quite limited, marketer could target the advertisement on usage expansion, such as the advertising focused on different product usages under different situations by using situation comparison advertising. Or they could adopt non-comparison advertising to promote the attributes that current consumers missed. Marketers could also choose the right Medium to address the right target.

Pricing

By knowing what values/needs consumers have and their attitude towards the product, marketers could make different pricing strategies to two types of products.
