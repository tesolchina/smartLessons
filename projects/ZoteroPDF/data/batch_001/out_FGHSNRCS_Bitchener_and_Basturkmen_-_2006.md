# Abstract

In postgraduate study, students including L2 students are often required to write a thesis and, as a growing literature reveals, L2 students often experience difficulties in the writing of this genre. While most of this research has involved surveys (questionnaires and interviews) and case studies of supervisor perceptions, only a few studies have also considered student perceptions. Most of the perceptions have considered student difficulties when writing the thesis as a whole, rather than particular section. The present study, based on the use of in-depth interviews with four supervisor–student pairs, focused on student difficulties in writing the discussion of results section (DRS) of the thesis and investigated the extent to which the perceptions of the students matched those of their supervisors. The study found that: (1) students had a more limited understanding of the function of the DRS compared to that of their supervisors; (2) common understanding between the supervisors and the students about the nature and cause of the students’ difficulties was limited; and (3) students tended to use limited proficiency as a default mode of explanation of their difficulties whereas three out of the four supervisors offered explanations not related to second language proficiency.

# 1. Background

Difficulties encountered by L2 student writers at a wide range of proficiency levels have been the subject of on-going research for more than forty years (Braine, 1989; Braine, 1995; HampLyons, 1991; Johns, 1990; Johns, 1993; Johns, 1995). While much attention has been given to identifying difficulties at the sentence and paragraph levels in undergraduate and postgraduate coursework papers, less research has investigated the extent to which these difficulties continue to be problematic for postgraduate L2 students writing a thesis in English.1 More recently, investigations have begun to examine whether, and the extent to which, such students also experience difficulties in understanding and meeting the genre requirements of the thesis. In this background section, we report on the nature of these difficulties.

# 1.1. Difficulties at sentence and paragraph levels

Supervisor perceptions of the difficulties encountered by postgraduate L2 students have been reported in several publications over the last twenty years. Casanave and Hubbard (1992) survey of 85 supervisors across 28 departments at Stanford University reported that L2 doctoral thesis students usually have more problems than native speakers and that these are more evident at the sentence level (grammatical accuracy and appropriateness, vocabulary appropriateness, spelling and punctuation accuracy) than at the paragraph level. Similar findings have been reported by Cooley and Lewkowicz (1995, 1997) in their study of 105 supervisors across nine faculties at the University of Hong Kong. However, the supervisors in this study explained that while difficulties with surface forms and structures (for example, the use of definite articles and subject–verb agreements) can be irritating, they are less problematic than difficulties affecting the development of coherent ideas and arguments. Difficulties with lexical choice, especially with levels of appropriateness and formality, were also identified in this study for their potential to obscure meaning. As well as these difficulties, Dong (1998) found in her study of two tertiary institutions in the US that L2 postgraduate students experience difficulty with the sequencing and development of propositions and with the use of transitions between propositions and topics.

The particular effect of these difficulties on overall communicative success was observed by James (1984) in his case study of a Brazilian PhD student at the University of Manchester. James categorised the effects according to whether they resulted in a breakdown of meaning, a blurring of meaning or a distraction of meaning. He tended to categorise difficulties at the sentence level as distractions for the reader whereas inefficient ordering of propositions, inappropriate weighting of propositions and functional incoherence were seen as more likely to blur intended meaning. However, he noted that some difficulties at the sentence level could also lead to a breakdown of meaning: overlong, complex sentences; faulty referencing; lexical difficulties associated with specialized vocabulary; and signposting weaknesses.

L2 student perceptions of the difficulties they experience when writing a thesis in English have also been reported in surveys by Cooley and Lewkowicz (1995, 1997) and Dong (1998). In Cooley and Lewkowicz’s survey, $26 \%$ of the L2 students thought that they had serious difficulties using English. In particular, they referred to problems in organising ideas and arguments, using the appropriate style of writing, and expressing their thoughts clearly in English. In Dong’s study, all of the L2 students said that they thought vocabulary choice was particularly important for expressing ideas and arguments. Approximately a third of the students believed that they had difficulties with vocabulary choice (compared with $10 \%$ for native speaker students). Interestingly, only $49 \%$ of ESL students believed that they had difficulty with grammar and mechanics. By comparison, $72 \%$ of native speakers thought that they had difficulty with these features. Difficulties with sequencing propositions, making transitions and achieving overall unity were also mentioned but no statistics were supplied.

# 1.2. Difficulties in understanding the requirements of the thesis genre

In addition to these difficulties at the sentence and paragraph levels, other problems relating specifically to the thesis genre have been identified by supervisors and, to a lesser extent, by students. Difficulties in structuring an argument over an extended stretch of discourse with consistency and balance have been noted in a number of studies (Cooley & Lewkowicz, 1995, 1997; Dong, 1998; Jenkins et al., 1993; Parry, 1998; Thompson, 1999). In particular, they report that students have difficulty understanding what content is appropriate for individual chapters and sections of a chapter as well as uncertainties about how it should be organized. Jenkins, Jordan and Weiland (1993) explain that, to some extent, these difficulties can result from a lack of clear and logical thinking but, as Paltridge (2002); Swales (2004) explain, they are just as likely to be the result of a limited knowledge of the characteristics of the genre and of their supervisors’ expectations.

Another major difficulty reported by supervisors concerns the positioning of arguments in relation to those of the wider literature. For example, they note that students often either overstate or understate the significance of their findings in relation to the published literature. As some supervisors have noted, part of this problem is caused by a failure to use the appropriate modal verbs when making claims about the findings of their research (Cooley & Lewkowicz, 1995, 1997; Parry, 1998; Thompson, 1999). Other supervisors have commented that positioning problems can result when students have a different conceptualization of the new academic community to that of their supervisors or an uncertainty about who their audience is and what its expectations are (Belcher, 1994; Casanave, 1992, 1995, 2002; Fox, 1994; Gale, 1994; Hirvela and Belcher, 2001; Shen, 1989). Belcher (1994) case study of three L2 students from different disciplines (Chinese Literature, Applied Mathematics and Human Nutrition) reports on the mismatch between supervisor and student understanding of writing goals and reader expectations. The supervisors in that study explain how mismatches are more characteristic of the less successful students. To help students understand the expectations of the academic community, Lillis (2001); Prior (1994) stress the importance of on-going dialogue between supervisor and student. Some studies (Cadman, 1997; Dong, 1998; Frost, 1999; Knight, 1999; O’Connell & Jin, 2001; Smith, 1999) have examined Chinese students in particular and found that postgraduate students have difficulty with the development of arguments and counterarguments, with the use of evidence to support arguments, and with the critical evaluation of theories, models and methodologies. As they explain, these difficulties are understandable given that they have been taught to respect and not question the ideas and opinions of their academic superiors.

There are a number of reasons why students may not develop an explicit knowledge of the functions, content and organisation of the thesis. Firstly, research has shown (Lillis, 2001; Parry, 1998; Prior, 1994) that supervisors themselves tend to have tacit rather than explicit knowledge of the features of the thesis in their own disciplines. Therefore, this may be one reason the requirements of the thesis are not articulated to the students. Secondly, students may complete a research methods course before starting their thesis and may also have opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills in short research projects but this does not guarantee that they will be able to apply it to thesis writing (Allison, Cooley, Lewkowicz & Nunan, 1998; Silva, Reichelt & Lax-Farr, 1994). Thirdly, students will certainly have read research articles related to their field of study before they start writing the thesis but they may not have consciously noticed the characteristic features of different sections of an article or variations that can occur within and across disciplines and journal types. Additionally, few students are likely to have read any of the studies that have identified the characteristics of different sections of research articles such as those by Dudley-Evans (1986); Samaraj (2002) and Swales (1981, 1990) on introductions, or those by Brett (1994); Williams (1999) on results sections.2 Finally, students may look at published advice in guides and handbooks on thesis writing. However, this advice is often limited in the detail it offers about specific sections of a thesis (Basturkmen & Bitchener, in press; Paltridge, 2002).

# 1.3. Gap in the literature

From this overview of the literature, it can be seen that postgraduate L2 students experience a range of difficulties not only at the sentence and paragraph levels but also in understanding and meeting the requirements of the thesis genre. Because a thesis comprises a number of different sections, it is possible that students may find some more difficult to write than others. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the cognitive demands of the discussion of results section (DRS) are likely to make this section of the thesis problematic for L2 students, particularly if they have been trained in an epistemology that has not encouraged the critical perspectives. Therefore, it is important that research investigates the level of understanding that supervisors and students have of the function of the DRS. Secondly, the literature has reported on a range of supervisor and student perceptions of the types of difficulties that L2 students encounter when writing their thesis. However, this consideration has not focused on the particular difficulties that they experience when writing the DRS. Thirdly, the literature has reported on difficulties perceived by supervisors and students as separate groups but it has not considered the extent to which there is a shared understanding of the difficulties in supervisor-student pairs. In order to meet these needs, three research questions were investigated in the this study:

1. What do supervisors and students perceive as the functions of the DRS?   
2. What do supervisors and students perceive as the difficulties of L2 students in writing the DRS?   
3. How does a student’s perceptions of his or her own writing problems compare to those of his or her supervisor?

# 2. Method

The method used to answer the research questions involved in-depth interviews. Four pairs of in-depth interviews were conducted. Each pair comprised an interview with a thesis supervisor and an interview with one of the L2 masters students that the supervisor was supervising. Oppenheim (1992) describes the “depth” interviews as organized around a handful of headings (p. 67) and functioning to explore how people think and feel about a topic. In-depth interviews were used in the present study to investigate how the participants conceptualised the functions of the DRS and student writing difficulties in it.

The study was conducted in two universities in Auckland, New Zealand. Two supervisors from each (two from Applied Linguistics in one university, and one from Business and one from Art and Design in the other university) and four of their masters’ level students participated in the study. We did not confine our study to one discipline as we wished to see whether ideas about the functions of the DRS and student writing difficulties in it might be shared by two or more disciplines. Two supervisors were male and two were female. The students were all female. In this report, all the supervisors are referred to as she and pseudonyms are used for both supervisors and students in order to protect their anonymity. We invited academic staff to participate in the research. Those who accepted the invitation nominated an L2 student whom they were supervising at that time. The researchers then invited the nominated students to participate. Four students participated in the research. Two were from Mainland China, one was from Korea and one from Eastern Europe. Three of the students were international students and one was a New Zealand permanent resident.

Each supervisor and student was interviewed once. The interviews lasted 30 to 45 minutes and were held towards the end of the supervisory process when the students were writing up their theses. The students had already submitted drafts of their DRS and received feedback from their supervisors. Interviews were conducted with the supervisors and students individually. The interviewees brought copies of recent versions of the student’s DRS to the interviews to refer to. In the departments in which the students were writing their theses, it was expected that the thesis would include a discussion of results section either as a separate chapter or as a section within the results chapter. One Applied Linguistics student had conducted a largely quantitative study and one a mixed methods study. The Business Studies student had conducted a quantitative study and the Art and Design student a qualitative study.

The interviews with the supervisors were based on a two-part interview schedule (see Appendix A). In the first part, the supervisors were asked to describe their general experiences of supervising ESL theses and the DRS. They were asked about the number of L2 students they had supervised, their perceptions of what a DRS should involve and the strengths and difficulties they noticed in students’ writing of this section. There was also a list of closed items of specific types of possible difficulties based on the study by Bitchener and Turner (2002). In the second part, the supervisors were asked about their perceptions of the DRS of the student participating in the study. Interviews with the students were based on a modified version of the same interview schedule (see Appendix B) so that their perceptions could be compared to those of their supervisors. In line with the recommendations for interviewing made by Richards (2003), we avoided sticking rigidly to the interview schedule and we tried to provide the interviewees with sufficient “thinking space” to encourage them to make extensive responses.

The interviews were audio-recorded. The recordings were transcribed using a broad level of transcription. The actual words and pauses were transcribed but not the phonological details.

There were two stages in processing the data. The first stage involved a broad reading of each transcribed interview. The aim was to identify the main problem(s) specified by each supervisor and student. An “image” was devised to label the supervisor’s idea of this problem. The term “image” and the inductive analytical procedure used were derived from Golombok (1998). Golombok defines an image as the personal, organising concept a teacher uses to construct and make sense of his or her experiences (pp. 452–453). Both researchers worked independently and then met to compare notes on the problems and agree on the labelling of the images.

The second stage of data processing was a micro level analysis of how participants described aspects of writing the DRS. A grid was devised to include the specific aspects addressed in the interview, namely: the function of the DRS, how it is organized and what content is included, the writing process, language difficulties, what stance writers should adopt in the DRS and what is most important (priorities). The responses of each pair were recorded on separate copies of the grid. We noted comments and recorded quotes made by the supervisor alongside those made by her student. The two researchers worked independently on the data and later compared notes.

As an additional check, “member validation” (Guba and Lincoln, 1985; Richards, 2003) was used. The information recorded on the grids was summarised and emailed to the participants. All four supervisors replied to the emails saying that they found the summaries to be accurate. Unfortunately, none of the students replied. At the time, the students were finishing or had finished their theses so had possibly lost interest in the research project or gone on holiday.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Perceptions of the functions of the DRS

The comments made by the participants about the functions and content of the DRS were examined. Table 1 shows the perspectives of the supervisors and Table 2 shows those of their students.

Table 1 shows the supervisors had similar perspectives. All felt that the DRS should make links between the results of the present study and the literature, summarize and discuss the results. Two further functions/content areas were identified by three of the supervisors. Comments made about student difficulties revealed the supervisors’ perceptions, for example: “Students don’t know the purpose of this section and find it difficult to link the content of the study back to the literature. Instead they tend to think THEY have to come up with explanations of their results” (Anne) and “She doesn’t use the literature to explain concepts but tries to do it herself...when she does use the literature.she does not really engage with it” (Celia).

Table 2 shows that shared understanding among the students was limited. At most, two of the students expressed the same idea. Kim and Tina both considered the function of the DRS in terms of presenting the results. Tanya and Susie considered it in terms of summarizing the results.

With the exception of Susie, the students had less to say about the functions and content of the DRS than the supervisors. They saw it as having one or two functions/content areas. Susie thought the DRS should not only summarize results and make links to the literature but also be a forum for the student to air her own opinions and discuss implications. The supervisors mentioned the role of the DRS in offering interpretations of results and reconsiderations but the students did not mention these ideas.

# 3.2. Perceptions of student difficulties in writing the DRS

The comments made by the participants about the process of writing the DRS and difficulties experienced were examined. The perspectives of the supervisors are shown in Table 3 and those of their students are shown in Table 4.

The supervisors had similar perspectives. They all felt that, in general, students lacked a full enough understanding of the DRS as a genre. One problem mentioned in this respect concerned the function of the DRS to make links between the present research and the literature. Celia described the problem in the following way: “I think there is a tendency (for students) to give weight again to their own interpretations and not to use other academic texts to make their, to support their claims. they seem to rely on themselves and their own interpretations rather than more academic type of argument.”

The supervisors all said the level of English proficiency of L2 students in general could sometimes be a hindrance. Between them, they mentioned a range of specific points including an inability to hedge, limited ability to make generalizations, and syntactic and lexical weaknesses. Three felt that, at times, the written expression of ideas was weak. Specific problems mentioned included: a lack of clear articulation of how ideas are linked; a lack of general ideas (generalizations), ideas being convoluted (bunched together), and ideas not being developed fully enough.

The students identified four to seven problems each. All reported (in line with the perception of their supervisors) not knowing well enough what was required in the DRS. One student said she really should ask her supervisor what content to include in the DRS. Another said she realized from supervisor feedback that she had mistakenly mixed the results and discussion of results sections. Like the supervisors, the students all raised the topic of their proficiency in

English. For the students, this was perceived as the major stumbling block to their writing well. Each mentioned specific linguistic difficulties (for example, tenses, limited range of vocabulary, language to express statistical information or make comparisons). Tina said she tried to cope with language difficulties by transferring expressions and chunks of language found in books to her own writing.

Like the supervisors, three students mentioned difficulties in expressing the relationship between ideas. However, unlike the supervisors, they saw this in terms of accurate choice of linking words (however, nevertheless, in spite of, etc.).

Susie and Kim were concerned about their writing style. They had been required to write clearly and felt their writing had become simple and boring. They both felt that they had problems in making paragraphs. Susie found it difficult to select content. She felt she had “too much to say” and was reluctant to discard any of her work.

# 3.3. Similarities and differences in the perspectives of supervisor–student pairs

The supervisors were asked about their student’s particular strengths in writing the DRS. All mentioned a number of strengths they had observed. The main focus of the present study was on difficulties, however. This section reports each supervisor’s perspectives of the main difficulty of her student and the image the supervisor used to convey this. The images are then compared to comments made by the student revealing what the student perceived as her main difficulties.

# 3.3.1. Pair A: Image of the supervisor—The big picture

Anne felt that Tanya had “tunnelled vision” to some extent. She tended to just write about her study rather than make connections to the “bigger picture” of existing literature. Tanya could usefully consider “how it (the result) relates to what other people have found and think about the implications.” Anne felt that Tanya sometimes also “struggled to present the bigger picture” by launching into a myriad of details about her findings rather than developing a limited number of main ideas.

Tanya felt a major problem for her was that she could not express ideas clearly because she had difficulties in linking ideas and could not use linking words. Anne also mentioned that Tanya, at times, found it difficult to express ideas clearly. According to Anne, her student expressed ideas weakly because she did not make enough generalisations and over-focused on details.

3.3.2. Pair B: Image of the supervisor—Too much weight to her own ideas

Celia felt that Susie tended to base her writing too much on her own ideas and that she did not discuss sufficiently the links between her results and the literature. She felt that Susie gave too much importance to her own interpretations and at times “projected her own beliefs onto the data.”

Susie felt a function of the DRS was to express her own opinions about the results. In the interview, she mentioned, in passing, the need to make links to the literature but referred more strongly to the need to write about her own opinions. For example, she talked about how she aimed to produce “an integration of my idea with the result.” Susie felt her main problem was her proficiency in English and that she made too many errors in grammar and word choice. Celia recognised that Susie had some problems with her language proficiency but according to Celia this was not a critical matter. Celia said she could “ignore grammar.”

# 3.3.3. Pair C: Image of the supervisor—Losing meaning

Catherine felt the main problem was that Kim’s writing sometimes lacked clear meaning and could be convoluted (ideas “globbed” together). There was a need, she felt, for Kim to separate out ideas, explain the reasoning behind them and show how they were linked. Catherine said that, at times, she had to infer meaning (“I think that is what it means”). She felt it was possible that this problem occurred because Kim thought in her native language and translated into English.

Kim felt her main problem was her proficiency in English. Catherine, her supervisor, had seen language as contributing to the lack of clarity in the writing but not as the major cause. Kim worried that her writing was simple and boring. There was no mention of this from Catherine who had simply wanted clearer expression of meaning.

# 3.3.4. Pair D:—Image of the supervisor—The gap

Jane felt Tina’s main problem was in expressing meaning clearly and that this was linked to her proficiency in English. Tina did not have a good enough grasp of “the tool of language” and so there was a gap between the complex concepts that she needed to express and her language resources for doing so. A further problem that Jane mentioned was the tendency for Tina to use the literature superficially - she “just pays lip service to it.”

Tina also referred to her difficulties with English but did not make comments of a specific nature. Jane had felt that Tina lacked the English to express abstract concepts. During the interview, Tina commented that she would find it difficult to express abstract concepts in her native language. Tina also referred to the literature, saying she did not understand it well and felt that she should read more. In this case, both parties identified similar problems but perceived the sources of the problems differently.

# 4. Discussion

Considering the first research question, we were not surprised to find that the supervisors had a similar understanding of the functions of the DRS given their level of experience in conducting and writing up their own research projects and in supervising other thesis students. That three of them mentioned three rather than four functions was not an issue as sectional emphases and requirements can vary within and across disciplines (Berkenkotter and Huckin, 1995; Swales, 2004). On the other hand, there was relatively little similarity in perspectives between the students. We had expected that all students would have mentioned the need to sum up the results of their study. However, this was not the case. This limited understanding of the role of the DRS was something of a surprise given the amount of time they had spent on writing earlier drafts of the DRS and the amount of detailed oral and written feedback they had received from their supervisors.

Several reasons could account for this limited understanding. They may have received more micro feedback on specific ideas and stylistic requirements than macro feedback on the overall structure and content parameters of the DRS (Belcher, 1994; Hirvela and Belcher, 2001; Lillis, 2001; Parry, 1998). All four students had completed a research methods course before starting their thesis but this does not necessarily mean that the functions of individual sections of the thesis had been covered. As we mentioned in the background section of this article, the advice provided in guides and handbooks can be limited. It is also possible that as emerging researchers, they may simply have not been ready to take on board all the requirements of the DRS. Arguably, the writing of the DRS makes greater cognitive demands on students than other sections of the thesis so it may be that students need closer supervision when writing the DRS than is necessary for other sections. Finally, it is possible that students may have difficulty writing this section if they have not revised their literature review - a section that is usually written several months earlier.

The second research question investigated supervisor and student perceptions of the difficulties that were encountered when writing the DRS. Not surprisingly, there was a good deal of similarity in the perspectives of the supervisors. As earlier research has revealed (Casanave and Hubbard, 1992; Cooley & Lewkowicz, 1995, 1997; Dong, 1998; Hinkel, 2003; James, 1984), all supervisors, as a group, acknowledged their students’ difficulties with linguistic proficiency (grammar and vocabulary). Additionally, most supervisors made repeated reference to difficulties in expressing and developing ideas. The difficulty of developing clear ideas when making arguments has been reported in other studies such as those by Cooley & Lewkowicz (1995, 1997) and James (1984). Many of the difficulties referred to by the supervisors were also identified by the students. First, students referred to their uncertainty about what content should be included in the DRS and about how it should be organized. This was quite surprising given the amount of time and feedback that the students had received from their supervisors. Consequently, we would recommend that future research investigate why such a situation can arise so late in the supervision process. Like the supervisors, the students also referred to their language difficulties. However, the students tended to see their problem more at the sentence level whereas the supervisors saw it more in terms of creating clear meaning at the paragraph level and in terms of understanding the rhetorical and organisational requirements of the genre. It became evident in the interviews that the supervisors had a higher level of awareness of the fundamental causes of their students’ difficulties than their students had. This suggests, therefore, that supervisors have a role to play in helping their students identify the underlying cause(s) of particular difficulties.

The third research question found a limited degree of similarity between supervisor and student perceptions of what was most problematic for the students. In the absence of other studies of paired perceptions, further research is needed to investigate the extent to which this is a widespread problem and why such mismatches can exist. On the one hand, they may be the result of communication issues between supervisors and students but, on the other hand, they may occur because students are not able to cognitively internalize and remember the advice they are given in supervisor feedback. A possible explanation for the limited degree of similarity may be seen in relation to Activity Theory (Lantolf, 2000). Activity theorists explain that individual learners construct activities in unique ways and can do so according to their individual goals and motives.

# 5. Conclusions

The results of this preliminary study corroborate many of the earlier research findings of supervisors and students about difficulties that L2 students encounter at the sentence and paragraph levels as well as providing some new understandings of the perceptions of supervisors and students concerning the difficulties experienced when writing a DRS. One of the new understandings to emerge from this study was the level of difficulty that students experienced in meeting the requirements of the genre. Both supervisors and students reported that L2 students were unsure about the various functions and content parameters of the DRS. Most significantly, it was found that the supervisors had a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of these difficulties than the students had. Another important finding in the study was the limited common understanding between supervisors and their respective students about the main difficulty the students were experiencing when writing the DRS and about the underlying cause(s) of the difficulty. The students tended to use limited language proficiency as a default mode of explanation of their difficulties whereas three of the four supervisors offered explanations that were not related to second language proficiency.

In light of these findings, several suggestions might be offered to supervisors. If they can identify the main difficulty that their students are experiencing and reflect on the underlying cause of the problem, it may be possible to treat the problem and resolve it within the supervision period. However, some difficulties may be less easily overcome within this timeframe. For example, those which rely more upon linguistic proficiency may be more difficult to resolve than those related to the specific genre requirements (function and content). The difficulty with expressing and linking ideas, as the supervisors mentioned, may be as much a cognitive issue as a linguistic one.

The findings of this study have brought to light a number of issues that future research could usefully investigate. The first issue that could be examined is the extent to which the findings of this study can be generalised to a wider L2 student population and the extent to which these findings can also be applied to native speaker students. A second issue concerns the extent to which these findings may vary within and across disciplines. A third issue concerns the design of the study. As we analysed our data, we became aware of the need for future research to operationalize the construct ’writing difficulties’ from both skills and concept perspectives. Specific difficulties at the sentence and paragraph levels need to be categorized separately from those related to the understanding of ideas, concepts, and specific genre functions. From the interview data, we also became aware of the need for future research to go beyond the mere identification of writing difficulties as they appear in the written text and identify the specific causes of these difficulties. We believe that if future research takes up these recommendations, it will find additional evidence to support the observations and suggestions of this preliminary study.

We wish to acknowledge the level of thought and time the supervisors and students gave to this study. Without their willingness to talk freely and openly about their experiences, the insights of this study would not have been revealed.

My name is X and I work in the School of Applied Language Studies/Department of Applied Language Studies. Part of the work of the School/Department is to help students who do not have English as their first language with writing for study purposes in the University.

In this interview I would like to ask some questions about your L2 masters students’ writing of dissertations and theses. By L2 I mean your non native speaker students - those for whom English is an additional language. I would like to ask you questions about your experiences of supervising such students.

I am particularly interested in any difficulties you perceive in the Discussion of Results section of $L 2$ masters students writing a thesis.

First of all, can you tell me about how many L2 masters students you have supervised in the last two years (2001–2003)?

How many do you currently supervise?

Next I would like to ask you some general questions:

Can you tell me about any difficulties you have noticed in these students’ (the students’ you currently supervise) draft versions of their Discussion of Results section (DRS).

Do you see such difficulties in most or some of your L2 masters students Discussion of Results?

Now I am going to ask you about some specific types of possible difficulties:

Have you noticed difficulties in:

understanding the functions of the Discussion of Results?   
selecting content?   
organisation of content?   
showing appropriate stance (how writers position themselves)?   
grammar? (Can you give an example or two?)   
word choice?

We have discussed a number of problem areas. Which do you see as the most significant areas (and why)?

In you opinion, why do these problems occur?

And finally, I would like to ask you about one student you currently supervise. I understand you have at hand a copy of this student’s draft DRS.

How would you describe this student’s writing?

What if any do you see as this student’s main problems?

Could you show me samples of these problems in the student’s writing?

Thank you for your help. Do you have questions you would like to ask me about this study?

Can you tell me about any difficulties you experienced in writing this chapter?

Now I am going to ask you about some specific types of possible difficulties:

Did you experience difficulties in:

understanding the functions of the Discussion of Results?   
selecting content?   
organisation of content?   
showing appropriate stance (how writers position themselves)?   
grammar? (Can you give an example or two?)   
word choice?

Why did these problems occur?

We have discussed a number of problem areas. In your opinion which is it most important to get right in writing a good Discussion of Results?
