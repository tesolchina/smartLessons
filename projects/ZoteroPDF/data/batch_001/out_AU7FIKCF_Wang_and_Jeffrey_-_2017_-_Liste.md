# Abstract

This study discusses the possibility of e-portfolio as a central component of assessment practice in the traditionally exam-oriented context of China's tertiary education. The aim was to listen to learners, and provide them with a voice to analyse their perception of the potential advantages and challenges of introducing a learning-focused assessment tool. From five consecutive annual cohorts (2007-2011), 220 university students completed questionnaires about their attitudes and experience of using eportfolio assessment in an English as a foreign language course, with 120 students participating in follow-up interviews and focus groups. The vast majority of learners expressed preference for e-portfolio assessment, compared to paper-based examinations. This study contributes to understanding Chinese educational ideology of assessment, so as to place emphasis on assessment for quality learning rather than on teaching to the test.

# Introduction

College English has been taught to China's non-English major undergraduate students since the 1980s, regulated by the College English Teaching Syllabus, and more lately by the College English Reform Program (hereafter "CERP") (Chinese Ministry of Education, 2007). College English is a compulsory course for the first two academic years, constituting $1 6 \%$ of the credit for a bachelor's degree. The CERP was introduced to improve teaching outcomes for a sustainable future, through better learning and assessment. It advocates incorporation of formative and summative assessment, recognising assessment's dual purpose-to improve as well as to measure. According to the CERP (Chinese Ministry of Education, 2007:38),

the use of "assessment" rather than "testing" indicates a deliberate deviation from previous practices; secondy, learning in terms of communicative ability is put at the centre of assessment; thirdly, new assessment approaches for formative purpose (such as portfolios, self and peer assessment, conference) are advocated to go hand-in-hand with summative assessment; fourthly, learners' involvement in assessment (by way of self assessment and peer assessment) is encouraged; and both process and product are emphasized. That is, assessment is to serve both learning enhancement and accountability.

# Practitioner Notes

What is already known about this topic

A range of e-portfolio systems have been developed, and accounts of how to perform e-portfolio assessment have been presented. Some studies have indicated an improvement in learning, while other studies have shown both advantages and disadvantages. Little large-scale research on e-portfolio assessment has been performed in the Chinese higher education context.

What this paper adds

Questionnaire data from 220 students and interview data from 120 students are used to investigate learner perception of e-portfolio assessment. Compared to typical Chinese university assessment, e-portfolio assessment increased student motivation for learning and increased student satisfaction with assessment.

Implications for practice and/or policy

The study suggests that college students in China may enjoy e-portfolio assessment and value the effects on their English learning. It appears feasible to consider eportfolios for supplementing College English assessment.

However, a tension arises between the CERP requirements and the College English Test (CET Band 4 and CET Band 6, compulsory standardised tests across China), a dominant fixture (Cheng. 2008). Many graduates, despite their well-earned CET certificates, still have difficulties understanding a menu or academic paper in English. It appears that the CETs simply measure some limited, partially irrelevant construct, and do not assure learning with understanding (Cai) 2014). Shu (2014) describes the CETs as a "nightmare" for some low-achievers, damaging their psychological well-being. Overall, the CETs do not appear to fulfl the CERP's aims.

As a result, teachers may consider alternative assessment techniques emphasising student participation and progress. In this study, the College English learning of five annual cohorts was assessed through e-portfolio, to examine the feasibility of e-portfolio assessment in the Chinese HE context.

# Literature review and research questions

E-portfolios and their purported advantages

Over the last two decades, e-portfolio assessment in EFL has undergone significant developments. From its inception in Europe, e-portfolio as a formative assessment tool influenced work in Canada and the US and led to a significant e-portfolio movement in US college writing courses (HampLyons & Condon, 2000). E-portfolio assessment is becoming increasingly positioned as a change agent, to transform "traditional" assessment of EFL learning contexts such as China's tertiary level.

E-portfolio assessment, like portfolio assessment more broadly, has received a variety of definitions (Hamp-Lyons & Condon, 2000; Klenowski, 2010). Here, an assessed e-portfolio is understood as a set of work which:

. includes both student work and student reflection on that work   
: was produced at different instances over a long period of time   
: includes some work produced outside of timed examination conditions   
. is kept and assessed in an electronic format (even if some or all work was not originally produced electronically)

Yancey (2009) demonstrated how e-portfolio systems might be used to collect reflections from students. She reviewed the e-portfolio systems of various universities and determined that the system design can impact whether or not students will reflect, and further showed that students who reflected were more engaged and reported more benefits of learning.

Greater utilisation of technology in higher education of this kind has been backed by Chinese policy-makers for a sustained period (Liu, Cheng, & Liu, 2010), and e-portfolio systems can be linked with the China Education and Research Network connections currently used at Chinese universities, extending their "e-campus" capabilities (Zhao & Jiang, 2010).

E-portfolios as formative assessment for learning

Following Bennett's review of the literature (2011), formative assessment is essentially positive in intent, in that it is directed towards promoting learning. It helps teachers to check the current status of their students' language ability, and allows students to participate in modifying or planning upcoming classes. Participation in their learning may enhance students' motivation, and awareness of the target language.

Under the constructivist theory of learning, e-portfolios enable students to continuously enrich their understanding of the world via critically interpreting, analysing, organizing, evaluating and reflecting (Fong et dl., 2014). The creation of e-portfolios is learner autonomous, or learner responsible, with teacher guidance and support and often with peer involvement (Chang, Tseng. & Lou, 2012). Dewey's principle of learning as self-directedness is employed; as is the Piagetian model for learning by assessing student work in a cumulative way through different learning stages. E-portfolio content must display tangible evidence of an individual's development (Cambridge, 2010), and is held to "foster English learning rather than simply measure it" (Cheng. Klinger, & Zheng, 2007:186), by exerting positive washback on College English learning.

Possibilities of using portfolios as a complement to current summative testing (CETs) E-portfolio assessment stands in marked contrast to the CET 4 and 6 assessments, each produced in timed examination conditions, on a single date, and retained in paper format by assessment administrators, offering no opportunity for later reflection by the student.

Skeptics criticise previous e-portfolio research as too unreflectively positive (Shu, 2014; Wang, 2010a). Clearly, a number of conditions may be required, such as "the right student who is capable of using IT," "the student's willingness in using the e-portfolio system" and "teacher attitude toward to e-portfolios in formative assessment of students achievement" as well as the need for "common ground of stakeholders of an institution," "the right classroom culture of accepting the innovation" and "a special culture of accepting e-portfolio evidence of students' achievements" (Gerbic, Lewis, & Amin, 2011).

Although the use of electronic portfolios in higher education has increased steadily in recent years (Yancey, 2009), some teachers feel excessively overburdened with workload (Cambridge, 2010; Chang et dl., 2012) or lacking in requisite training (Fong et dl., 2014). Hence, further solid evidence on e-portfolios is needed. As Golonka, Bowlesa, Franka, Richardson, and Freynika (2014:77) write, "In general, the few studies that exist show a mixture of advantages and disadvantages of the technology."

# Research questions

Building on the previous literature on e-portfolio assessment's purported advantages, and on calls for further empirical investigation in local contexts such as Chinese higher education, two research questions are presented and addressed.

1. How do the college students perceive the usability of e-portfolios?

2. What were their general attitudes towards the integration of e-portfolios in College Eng. lish pedagogy?

# Methodology

Methods

This study used mixed methods--questionnaires, semi-structured individual interviews, and focus groups- described in detail below.

Questionnaire

The questionnaire was first designed in English and then translated into Chinese, to assure accurate understanding of the contexts. The drafting of the questionnaire was a long process, beginning with reference to other published questionnaires. A draft was sent to 10 college students for piloting, at the same university as the participants. This produced valuable suggestions (eg, time needed for completion, length, wording). No open questions were used because piloting suggested these would make too great a demand on respondents' time and energy and lower the response rate. To ensure reliability, questionnaires were not modified during the 5 years.

The questionnaire investigated how these students used the e-porfolios during the implementation stage of the CERP, and their attitudes towards the integration of e-portfolios in College English pedagogy.

Semistructured interviews

The face-to-face individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 120 participants, selected through stratified sampling from 220. There were three criteria for this stratified sampling: age, gender and level of English proficiency.

Over the 5 years, the interviews covered roughly 50 hours. Interviews were recorded with a digi. tal audio-recorder. To establish empathy and rapport with the interviewees, the researcher prepared small gifts as compensation-deemed suitable in this cultural context--and endeavoured to accommodate interviewers' preferences (eg, preferred times and venues). Interview questions were not changed, to improve reliability.

# Focus groups

In this study, 12 students from the 2011 cohort were invited to take part in two focus groups of six. Invitation letters were sent with a list of topics and questions to guide the discussion. To gain further understanding about the application of e-portfolios, two issues were covered: (1) students' use of e-portfolios for English learning; (2) students' perceptions of e-portfolio use as an alternative for assessment for their College English learning results. To foster a relaxed atmosphere, the focus groups were arranged in a comfortable air-conditioned room at a time convenient for participants. Tea and snacks were provided. Focus groups were recorded with a digital audio-recorder.

# Context

The study was conducted at a well-equipped university in eastern China. All non-English major undergraduates (around 4800 freshmen annually) are required to study the College English course. From 2007 till now, all faculty of the university's foreign languages department have been encouraged to become familiar with the college's portfolio assessment. The e-portfolio system used, Mahara, is a fully featured e-portfolio, weblog, resume builder and social networking system. Of the approximate 4800 annual College English students, around 400 were taught using e-portfolio assessment each year. These students were trained to submit all College English assignments and projects into the secure online repository, and submissions were scanned with a plagiarism tool. The students were invited to write both in English and Chinese and their teachers required to provide feedback twice a semester, through Mahara.

The assessment requirements are explained to students, and it is made clear that they are responsible for obtaining evidence of College English learning for e-porfolio assessment. Students and teachers will select pieces from a student's combined work over the 1-year College English learning, to demonstrate that the relevant learning has been achieved. The e-portfolios may include:

: written compositions and drafts   
: guided writings   
: journal entries   
: diaries   
: reading log   
: reading responses   
: emails or letters to friends   
: book reports   
: field trip reports (eg, to museum)   
: travel log   
: story writing and story adaptation   
: reflection papers   
: movie reviews   
: Chinese-English translations of campus news articles   
: transcripts of video or audio reports from BBC News, CNN and VOA

Thus, while for many e-portfolios there is an emphasis on students' English writing, students also have opportunity to display their reading and listening abilities, as wellas their ability to integrate these different skills.

The students'e-porfolios are organised by topics or themes for assessment and evaluation, assessing progress, achievement, developmental strengths and areas for continued work. The students are frequently supported in the development of their e-portfolios via mentoring from an assigned e-portfolio advisor. Some tasks were compulsory, as required by CERP (Chinese Ministry of Education, 2007:38, 69, 103-106), focusing on student reflection through the writing of journals and self- and peer-evaluations. A student's e-portfolio accounts for 80 marks, while paper-based examinations account for the other 20 marks.

# Participants

From the approximate 400 annual students on e-portfolio assessed courses, a random sample were invited to participate in the study. In each year 2007-2010, the first 45 students who consented were confrmed as participants. In 2011, this was reduced to 40 students. Thus, in total 220 students participated in the questionnaire. Their ages ranged from 17 to 19. They were taught College English in both the first and second semester of the academic year. Table 1 gives a further breakdown.

Table 2: Number of interview participants by sex, age and year

For the qualitative interviews, a total of 120 students were sought. Most of these interview participants were invited based on a random selection from the 220 questionnaire participants. A few interview participants were invited based on a random selection from the other e-portfolio assessed students who were not involved. Invitations were sent until a substantial number of interview participants (at least 20) had been arranged. Table 2 gives a further breakdown.

All of the research participants later went on to complete the CET 4 exam. However, it was not feasible to investigate the relationship between e-portfolio study and CET score within the parameters of this study. The annual assigning of approximately 400 students to e-portfolio assessed courses was decided by institutional administrators, often based on particular teachers or particular academic majors, thus introducing a number of confounding variables which may also influence CET scores. Further, it is hypothesised that e-portfolio use influences aspects of students' English proficiency construct which are not measured by the traditional CET assessment. And so, instead this research focused only on the students' self-reported perceptions and motivations in relation to the e-portfolio use, as specified in the research questions.

All research participants completed written consent forms, and were fully informed of the scope and details of the research at the outset. It was made clear that there was no pressure to participate, and that neither participation nor nonparticipation would influence their scores for the course.

# Data collection

The quantitative questions covered the students' background information (questions 1-2), students' conceptions of usefulness of the e-portfolios in fostering their reflectiveness (questions 3-5), gaining confidence in using e-portfolios (questions 6-11, 13, 14), using the e-portfolio in achieving ideal learning results (questions 12, 15), and the students' purposes of using e-portfolios (question 16). These five areas correspond to the themes found in the literature on e-portfolios (Kabilan & Khan, 2012; Oner & Adadan, 2011). Two hundred twenty questionnaires were returned. Then, the questionnaires were coded and input into SPss (19.0). Findings emerging from the questionnaires were used to inform the later focus groups.

The qualitative data derived from the individual semistructured interview of the 120 students, most of whom were also questionnaire respondents from 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The two open-ended questions asked the students to provide detailed answers on how well the e-portfolio College English learning drove the students to the desired assessment outcome, and their reflection on their learning processes. All together nearly 3200 minutes of audio recording were produced, each interview lasting around 30 minutes.

Each participant answered all 16 questions. Both the transcription and analysis were carried out in the source language (Chinese) to minimise any loss of meaning. Later, quotes from the interviews and the focus group were translated into English for presentation in this article.

# Results

Table 3 shows that almost all the students access the Internet in their daily study and life. Among 220 participants, only 4 evaluated their IT knowledge as beginner level. These four students were males from rural areas in north-western China.

The questionnaire items were grouped around three main themes--student behaviour, student satisfaction and student motivation. Tables (4-6) give detailed results for responses to the questionnaire items, categorised by these three themes.

Thus, the students were mostly new to e-portfolios, devoted 1-2 hours and very much effort to their submissions each time, and relied on peers when they needed help. The vast majority reported satisfaction with e-portfolio assessment and desire to experience it in future courses. Overwhelmingly, the students reported very high levels of engagement and motivation, and a lot of, or very much, improvement in their English as a result of the e-portfolio assessment.

The 5-year questionnaire investigations showed similar trends to Gerbic et al. (2011). The students mostly had strongly positive attitudes toward e-porfolios, although a few were not so confident about producing e-portfolios. Compared with Gerbic et al., the positive feedback from this questionnaire is much higher.

The qualitative data from interviews and focus groups In the semistructured interviews, the majority of the interviewees offered either positive responses or negative responses towards the e-porfolios. The focus groups showed the same trend. although with slightly more neutral affective responses. The following responses were selected from the Chinese transcript and then translated from Chinese into English.

Students' general positive affective response   
From 120 students, 112 produced a general positive affective response. The following comments from interviews are selected as representative.

An e-portfolio can promote and improve our College English learning.

An e-portfolio helps us know and recognize the standards we're aiming for.

The e-portfolios are closely related to my English learning plan.

Creating an e-portfolio could foster a more collaborative College English learning environment.

In both focus groups, students' overall attitudes towards e-portfolios seemed to be overwhelmingly positive, which is consistent with the questionnaire results. Out of the 120 students, 8 expressed an unclear or neutral affective response toward their e-portfolio use in College English learning.

Students' gaining confidence in using e-portfolios

From 120 students, 110 mentioned gaining in confidence while using the e-portfolios. The following comments from interviews are selected as representative.

An e-portfolio builds our confidence.

An e-portfolio can involve us in decisions about the choice of inclusion and quality learning completed.

An e-portfolio makes us better critical thinkers.

I've gained an effective way to learn English from my peers through my e-portfolios.

The majority of the individual interviewees felt that the e-portfolio had improved their College Eng. lish learning confidence, a finding echoed in the focus groups of both cohorts. Out of 120 students, 9 who had self-evaluated as weak in IT said e-portfolio use was particularly time-consuming.

Students' using the e-portfolios in self-assessing their learning   
From 120 students, 100 mentioned using the e-portfolios for self-assessment. The following comments from interviews are selected as representative.

An e-portfolio can involve us in self-assessment.

An e-portfolio can provide proper feedback, showing us the next steps and how to take them.

An e-portfolio involves us in reviewing and reflecting on the assessment information.

Many students felt that this type of self-assessment was ultimately more detailed and accurate than traditional forms of assessment.

An e-portfolio allows us to show the differences between us.

An e-portfolio is an effective record of English learning, showing actual evidence of my English achievement.

An e-portfolio can produce a rounded portrait of each individual.

Students felt that e-portfolio use improved their self-management and metacognition, and that it caused them to better engage with the other aspects of the assessment system and broader curriculum.

It's a new tool to manage my English learning.

We need to engage with the criteria before self-assessment.

The feedback from the focus groups showed that a large majority of the students expressed positive viewpoints on the e-portfolio College English learning results, and this was also confirmed by views expressed in the questionnaires and interviews results. Eleven out of 120 students reported the e-portfolio results were somewhat problematic since the results were not well matched with the results of their CET 4: only a little higher than the equivalent paper-based test results. Nine out of 120 students felt it was unfair to evaluate a student's College English learning results using e-portfolios, because of some students' relatively poor IT skills.

Students' behaviours and intended goals when using e-portfolios   
From 120 students, 109 discussed their specific behaviour and intended goals relating to the eportfolios. The following comments from interviews are selected as representative. Many students reported a particular appreciation for the increased opportunity to review and evaluate their own work.

We can chart our progress and take ownership of our learning.

My English learning progress can be shown to my parents and my teachers too.

Many years later, we can see our stories from the e-portfolios.

We can look at the process of learning and creating, including the very early drafts.

Many students linked e-portfolio use to improvements in their general communicative language ability, outside of the traditional classroom setting.

The e-portfolio task lets college students use English out of class.

The e-portfolios developed our own communicative language ability, especially writing and cultural sensitivity

Some also suggested that e-portfolio use could improve course and teacher evaluation.

Maybe it could make College English teachers more accountable.

In terms of purposes of using e-portfolios in College English, the students from the focus groups reported their ability to use e-portfolios as an important element in their perceived status as a qualified English learner. Out of 120 students, 8 had were unclear about how they used the eportfolios, while a further 3 would not like to look again at their portfolios: "we just follow the teacher's requirement to finish the task."

Neutral affective responses

In the focus groups, some interviewees made neutral comments on the e-portfolio assessment. Several recognised the benefits while simultaneously expressing concern about the demands on time.

The e-portfolios did help us learn College English in an allaround way. Our present concern centres on the large amount of time we have invested, since we have to balance [this] with some other subjects.

We could see our progress with satisfaction compared with the results of CETs. But when we look back, we've realized that it is really time-consuming.

Others again reported an improvement in their English as a result of the e-portfolio assessment, but this was tempered by anxiety over the final peer-show stage.

We have come to know that there are varieties of interesting ways of learning English other than memorizing English vocabulary ... and doing multiple-choice exam questions. However ... some of us felt uneasy in the stage of peer-exhibition.

As practitioner teachers, it may be worth reconsidering the e-portfolio peer-show stage, and care.   
fully planning and monitoring the amount of time students expend on the e-portfolios.

Some problems when using e-portfolios in college English learning

Participation was not a positive experience for all the students, as summarised in Table 7. Two students emphasised their poor competence in IT. A small proportion of the students also mentioned discomfort over reflection on one's learning and areas for improvement, and felt less clear about overall requirements because of the unfamiliar style of the course.

In both focus groups, for some questions "neutral" opinions were somewhat high, which may indicate respondents' uncertainty, or their unwillingness to reveal their true opinion--an often recognised drawback of focus groups (Malhotra & Birks, 2007:183). The interviews with individual students indicated that those interviewed, at least, were very willing to accept e-portfolios in the process of their College English learning. In the focus groups, some students said they felt compelled to use e-portfolios out of class "mechanically," that they did not have sufficient time to reflect on its use, and that they even felt uncertain over how to reflect.

# Discussion

The two hypotheses were corroborated by the findings. According to the questionnaire results (Tables 4-6) and the interview and focus group data, e-portfolio assessment caused the students to feel more motivated in comparison to their previous study experiences, and the students expressed greater satisfaction. This is in marked contrast to traditional examination-based College English learning, often decried as producing "deaf-and-dumb English" or "a kettle of never-boiled water" (Peng, 2007:28).

As relates to the research question, students were found to spend a relatively large amount of time working with the written form of English: writing extended texts, reading extended texts, and exchanging short electronic messages.

The increased motivation and satisfaction would appear to be linked to the nature of e-portfolio assessment, assessing students' complex performance of English language productive skills (O'Sullivan et al., 2012). Compared to the traditional paper-based tests that have the greatest washback on China's university students, e-portfolio assessment draws on a broader sample of College English learners' work, and is contextualised within a more authentic environment (Ok & Erdogan, 2010). The large majority of questionnaire participants expressed this view, and it was also corroborated in the interviews-for example, "the e-portfolio assessment led to communication with others by expressing authentic feedback and personal feelings, and greater collaboration with peers -- all of this was different to the limited, even negative effect on my learning caused by paper exams." From Tables 4-6, we can see that the students also evaluated themselves as having significantly increased English ability, and greater engagement with course content, and they preferred eportfolio assessment over previously experienced assessment formats.

In interviews and the focus groups, one problem eliciting negative responses was the peer-show/ exhibition. Two causes may be suggested: it was too demanding and therefore stressful for students with lower English proficiency; and some students preferred following the habit of learning under teachers' firm control, common in China (Chang et dl., 2012). Thus, students may have benefitted from more training.

Another practical problem found in both interview and questionnaire data was the significant time demands, commonly recognised in relation to e-portfolio assessment. In this study, most students agreed that "compiling an e-portfolio took a lot of time."

Students' reactions at first were negative. "E-portfolio is fine in Hong Kong but unworkable here," one student said. "How am I supposed to do it well when I am not exactly sure what the professor wants to see in it?" This comment points to the cultural issues of teacher-as-leader. Students wanted to be sure of what the teacher wanted--they would then happily supply it. A year later, the same student commented, "Now I do not see the e-portfolio as just an assignment to submit. It is instead a powerful learning tool for the learner himself."

# Conclusion

The study suggests that college students in China may prefer e-portfolio assessment over their traditional assessments, and value the benefits for their English learning even if the students still had to sit the CETs. They identify how summative assessments need to change and how expectations of achievement need to develop in order to sustain motivation. This study is not about claiming that e-portfolio practices will lead to successful College English learning. Instead it has conducted a 5-year study, lluminating an approach to EFL research where the data generated through listening to learners are "owned" by them. Five-year selection and combination of data-gathering procedures when used reflectively and collaboratively can provide a trigger to bring about changes to China's tertiary EFL assessment practices. Arguably, listening to learners provides a frame of reference about how situated professional assessment practice needs to change if successful e-portfolio use is to be sustained across very different contexts.

However, the adoption of the e-portfolio as a formative assessment of students' learning process would require a major shift in thinking. It is "a cultural and political problem in China that students and teachers, who have no say in the decision-making process, are the ones required to implement the changes in curriculum design and materials" (Wang, 2010b:443). The study did not interview major decision-makers who set College English policy. Obstacles and resistance to e-portfolios are evident due to its defying the established assessment conceptualisation, deeplyrooted in China. Although the use of e-portfolios as a way of assessing and evaluating has roots in individual needs, institutional needs and social needs, its implementation to replace China's national standardised language testing takes time. It is hoped that this article could contribute to further understanding of alternative assessment in the Chinese higher education context, so as to emphasise quality College English learning rather than teaching to the test only, and to stimulate further studies related to this issue, especially using e-portfolios in teaching English as a foreign language internationally.
