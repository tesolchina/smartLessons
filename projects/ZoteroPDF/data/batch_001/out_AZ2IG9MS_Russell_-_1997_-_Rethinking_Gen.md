# Rethinking Genre in School and Society

An Activity Theory Analysis

DAVID R. RUSSELL Iowa State University

The relation between writing in formal schooling and writing in other social practices is a central problem in writing research (e.g., critical pedagogy, writing in nonacademic settings, cognition in variable social contexts). How do macro-level social and political structures (forces) affect micro-level literate actions in classrooms and vice versa? To address these questions, the author synthesizes Yrjo Engestrom's systems version of Vygotskian cultural-historical activity theory with Charles Bazerman's theory of genre systems. The author suggests that this synthesis extends Bakhtinian dialogic theory by providing a broader unit of analysis than text-as-discourse, wider levels of analysis than the dyad, and an expanded theory of dialectic. By tracing the intertextual relations among disciplinary and educational genre systems, through the boundary of classroom genre systems, one can construct a model of ways classroom writing is linked to writing in wider social practices and rethink such issues as agency, task representation, and assessment.

The relation between writing in formal schooling and writing in other social practices is a central problem in writing research, whether it is research on critical writing pedagogy, on writing in nonacademic settings, or on the cognition of individual writers in variable social contexts. How can one analyze the macro-level social and political structures (forces) that affect the micro-level actions of students and teachers writing in classrooms, and vice versa? There is currently no comprehensive theory of writing to explain how doing school, doing work, and doing the other (political, familial, recreational, etc.) things our lives are made of come together through the mediation of writing--or how to trace the ways people change as writers, individually and collectively, as they move within and among various social practices. In this article, I set out to synthesize aspects of Y. Engestrom's (1987, 1993) systems version of Vygotskian culturalhistorical activity theory with aspects of Bazerman's (1994a) theory of genre systems to understand the relation between writing in school and writing in other social practices, particularly disciplines and professions and the powerful institutions they serve.

I suggest that this synthesis further expands in three ways what I believe is the most elaborated current theory of context---dialogism. It provides (a) a broader unit of analysis than text-as-discourse, (b) wider levels of analysis than the dyad, and (c) an expanded theory of dialectic that embraces objects and motives of collectives and their participants to explain reciprocal interactions among people through texts, which dialogism theorizes as the heteroglossic interpenetration of social languages. By tracing the intertextual relation of a disciplinary or professional genre system to an educational genre system, through the boundary of a classroom genre system, the analyst/reformer can construct a model of the interactions of classroom with wider social practices.

As Nystrand, Greene, and Wiemelt (1993) rightly point out, theories of writing in composition studies, as well as in literary criticism and linguistics, have expanded in the last 40 years from formalism to a structuralist constructivism and, in the 1980s, to neostructuralist social constructionism. Social constructionism generally views writing in terms of metaphors of social context (Martin, 1993), variously theorized as rhetorical situation (Bitzer, 1968) or community (for critical reviews, see Harris, 1988; Kent, 1993). In this way, social constructionism attempts to account for the social dimensions of writing as well as the textual (formalist) and cognitive psychological (constructivist) dimensions (e.g., Flower, 1994). But as Nystrand et al. (1993), Kent (1993), and Prior (in press) point out in different ways, social constructionists, like their predecessors, have reinscribed structuralist views. The theories have been based mainly on metaphors that suggest an underlying neo-Platonic or Cartesian dualism of something contained and its container, text and context, mind (knowledge, interpretants, etc.) and society, individual and community. In social constructionist theories, some theoretical construct (e.g., discourse or interpretive community, social context, paradigm, communicative competence, social norms, social forces, ideology, etc.) is bracketed off, posited as a deep explanatory structure, and treated as an underlying "conceptual scheme" (Kent, 1993) or "tertium quid" (Rorty, 1979) or "underlying domain or form" (Nystrand et al., 1993) or "neostructuralist trope" (Prior, in press) to explain behavior, including writing. Although neostructuralist theories have made a central place for social analysis, they beg the question of the relation between context and activity, of the genesis and operation of underlying conceptual schemes.

More recently, poststructuralist theories based wholly or in part on Bakhtin's (1981, 1986) pioneering work in literary criticism have challenged social constructionist assumptions. These dialogic theories explain discourse, including writing, not in terms of some bracketed underlying conceptual scheme but as a dynamic, functional, intersubjective process of reciprocal negotiation among writers and readers, in which discourse mediates interactions among conversants. There is no conceptual bracketing of text and context, conversant and context. As Holquist (1990) puts it, "Discourse does not reflect a situation, it is a situation" (p. 63, quoted in Nystrand et al., 1993, p. 300).

By substituting metaphors of conversation and dialog for metaphors of context and its contents, dialogism expands theories of writing to allow a more dynamic and interactive-or ecological--- approach, in which one can pursue a more thorough and symmetrical analysis of the relation between writing in schooling and society than is possible with theories that depend on some underlying conceptual scheme. Because cognition is always already social in this view, there is no Cartesian or neo-Platonic split between knowing and doing, mind and society. Dialogism thus goes further than social constructionism toward solving the problems of the dynamic and interpenetrating relations among discourse, the individual, and the social; among language, knowledge, and action.

Yet, dialogism's conversation metaphor, like any other, is limiting in several ways. Perhaps because Bakhtin's object was the analysis of literary texts, "he links dialog and meaning construction only to signs, and to words in particular" (R. Engestrom, 1995, p. 198). By focusing on dialog and voices, by limiting the unit of analysis to oral and written utterance as discourse, dialogism brackets off a wide range of nonconversational actions and the material tools through which they are carried out. The ongoing social practices in which speaking and writing operate also use a host of nonlinguistic tools: buildings, machines, demarcated physical space, financial resources, data strings, and so on. This can be a particular limitation in studying writing, because writing is used to organize ongoing actions over much larger reaches of time and space than does face-to-face conversation, mobilizing material tools in much more regularized and powerful ways. Thus, a broader unit of analysis may be useful.1

In addition, dialogism's conversation metaphor tends to focus attention on the dyad as the level of social analysis, leading analysts to examine pairs of conversants in their conversational turns or utterances within the classroom (Nystrand et al., 1993). Furthermore, dialogism typically analyzes the behavior of collectives beyond the conversational moment only in terms of broad social languages and the relation between collectives in terms of the heteroglossic interpenetration of voices from different social languages in conversation. Yet, many collectives (such as disciplines, professions, governments, industries, and educational institutions) have long-term objectives and motives beyond conversation, which condition--but do not determine--participants' actions (including writing) in powerful ways. In these sorts of collectives, the object of dialog is not ordinarily the conversation itself (as it might be in casual talk among friends or in literary productions) but some shared object and long-term motive of the collective to do some things to, and some things with, some other things beyond discourse (R. Engestrom, 1995). Moreover, dialogism does not focus on the long-term objects of activity and the motives individuals and groups have for acting (including writing) in certain ways and not others that grow out of social practices beyond the classroom. How shall we include these objects and motives in an analysis, moving in a principled way from broad collectives (social languages, in Bakhtinian terms) to the micro-level behavior of writing for some specific purpose and vice versa, from classroom conversations and other local actions to the systems of disciplines, professions, institutions, and movements organized in part through writing?

Finally, dialogism focuses on the dialectical relation between the cognitive and the social, or between individuals engaged in reciprocal utterances (usually dyads). However, the dialectical relations between and among collectives are not ordinarily the focus of analysis, apart from the reciprocal interpenetration of dialogic voices drawn from social languages. But how and why do certain voices and not others arise in classrooms? Voices of the mind (Wertsch's [1991] phrase) embody not only the local construction of referentiality in the ongoing conversation but also the global activity of collectives such as institutions and the stakes of various stakeholders. What lies in between social languages and the voices and speech genres of conversational moments? What motivates a particular heteroglossic concatenation of voices? Collectives pursuing different objects and motives interact with one another in a host of ways over time, producing not only micro-level local conflicts but also deep, ongoing dialectical contradictions within and among social practices at the macro level, in which collectives are at "cross purposes" (R. Engestrom, 1995). How shall we analyze the midlevel relations between the two? To understand the writing--and power relations-of people in and among institutions such as schools, academic disciplines, and professions, it may be useful to have (a) a broader unit of analysis than text-as-discourse, (b) wider levels of analysis than the dyad, and (c) an expanded theory of dialectic that embraces objects and motives of collectives and their participants as well as reciprocal interactions among minds and texts in the interpenetration of social languages.

In this article, I first sketch an alternative offered by a systems version of Vygotskian activity theory, then elaborate the theory in terms of North American genre research, and finally illustrate how the theory can clarify certain problems of analyzing how students change as writers, drawing on examples of research on writing in the disciplines in higher education. This systemic genre analysis may be helpful to literacy efforts that must deal with diversity among students (e.g., critical pedagogy) and specialization in schooling and beyond (e.g., writing across the curriculum [WAC]). As Brandt (1992) points out, apart from the feminist analysis of Smith (1984), ethnomethodological approaches generally have not attempted to construct a theory to connect locally produced events with other events that "intrude upon and regulate" the specific local events with which they are concerned (p. 351). But writing research needs such a theory, as writing in modern bureaucratic societies mediates events widely separated in space and time. I hope that analysis of genre systems may offer a theoretical bridge between the sociology of education and Vygotskian social psychology of classroom interaction, and contribute toward resolving the knotty problem of the relation between macro- and microstructure in literacy research based on various social theories of context (Layder, 1994). The synthesis I am proposing treats context not as a separate set of variables but as an ongoing, dynamic accomplishment of people acting together with shared tools, including--most powerfully--writing.

# ACTIVITY SYSTEM VERSUS CONTEXT AND CONVERSATION

A recent version of Vygotskian cultural-historical activity theory offers a powerful analysis of the relation between formal schooling and other social practices. Let me first outline that theory before connecting it with Bazerman's (1994a) genre systems theory to suggest how we can trace the ways writing links school and society.

The broad tradition of activity theory--now encompassing many different strands--was first developed out of Vygotsky's psychological theory by one of his main collaborators, A. N. Leont'ev, beginning in the late 1930s (Kozulin, 1990; Nardi, 1996). It evolved into a major direction in Russian social psychology and now has adherents worldwide, influencing studies in education, language socialization, computer interface design, and expert work, among others. Like social constructionism, activity theory traces cognition and behavior, including writing, to social interaction. Like dialogism, activity theory does not posit some underlying conceptual scheme or deep structure for explaining behavior (including writing), but it does look at the reciprocal mediation of behavior in mutual exchange and negotiation. Both dialogism and activity theory move from the social to the individual in their analyses. The object of analysis is neither texts nor minds nor conceptual schemes per se but what is in between--the social intercourse.

The version of activity theory I am using, developed by Cole and Engestrom (1993), avoids metaphors of context and contents or conversational dialog, substituting instead metaphors of interlocking, dynamic systems or networks. These systems embrace both human agents and their material tools, including writing and speaking. I am suggesting that system or network metaphors, as developed in this version of activity theory, can perhaps facilitate analysis of writing and learning by allowing us to theorize and trace the interactions among people and the inscriptions called texts (and other material tools) without separating either from collective, ongoing motivated action over time. In this way, it may be possible to overcome the macro/micro distinction and other Cartesian dualisms by locating and analyzing a particular action or group of actions in both their synchronic and diachronic relations to other collective actions in systems or networks, especially those actions relatively remote in time and place in which writing is often crucial. I suggest that in doing so, we may extend---beyond discourse and beyond dyadic relations--- our analyses of how students and teachers use classroom writing in relation to writing in other social practices.

Figure 1. An activity system

Cole and Engestrom's version of activity theory posits the activity system as the basic unit of analysis of behavior, individual and collective (Y. Engestrom, 1987, 1993; Cole & Engestrom, 1993). An activity system is any ongoing, object-directed, historically conditioned, dialectically structured, tool-mediated human interaction. Some examples are a family, a religious organization, an advocacy group, a political movement, a course of study, a school, a discipline, a research laboratory, and a profession. These activity systems are mutually (re)constructed by participants historically, using certain tools and not others, including discursive tools such as speech sounds and inscriptions. The activity system is the basic unit of analysis for both groups' and individuals' behavior, in that it analyzes the way concrete tools are used to mediate the motive (direction, trajectory) and the object (the problem space or the focus) of behavior and changes in it (see Figure 1).2

The subject is the agent(s) whose behavior (including that kind of behavior called discourse) the analyst is focusing on. The identity of both individuals and groups is conceived in social terms as the history of their involvements with various activity systems. Both individuals and groups can be involved in multiple activity systems. Individual identity---the uniqueness of each individual--results.from the intersection of the person's history of involvements among multiple activity systems in combination with idiosyncratic factors (genetic and epigenetic).3

Tools (mediational means) refer to material objects in use by some individual or group to accomplish some action with some outcome-- that is, tools-in-use, as I will sometimes refer to them, to remind us that a material thing is not a tool unless it has been put to some use, and the uses of a single material thing may differ over time and across different actions and activity systems. A Bible can be an object of worship, a textbook, a literary work, a doorstop, a source of cigarette paper, and so on. Similarly, a text with chronological ordering devices can be a novel, a genealogy, a research methods section, a grant proposal, an instruction manual, and so on.

The object/motive refers to the raw material or problem space on which the subject(s) brings to bear various tools in ongoing interaction with another person(s). The object is shaped and changed over time to produce some outcome. This is the object of study of some discipline (e.g., cells in cytology, literary works in literary criticism). The object or focus of activity implies an overall direction of that activity, a (provisionally) shared purpose or motive (e.g., analyzing cells, analyzing literary works). Of course, the direction or motive of an activity system and its object are contested, as individuals bring many motives to a collective interaction, and the division of labor in the system itself guarantees diversity. Dissensus, resistance, conflicts, and deep contradictions are constantly produced in activity systems.

Like other species, humans act purposefully to meet biological needs. But unlike other species, human behavior may differ radically among groups. The use of tools (including vocalizing and marking) and---most important--the division of labor enabled by tools mediate humans' interactions, separating biological motives from the socially constructed object/motives of activity. From the first year of life, human beings begin to meet biological needs by involvement with a whole range of social activity systems, each with different object/ motives, each interacting with other activity systems through tool mediation. Biological motives are quickly subsumed by social motives.

With the social division of labor, a range of ongoing systems or networks of activity arise and proliferate. The use of tools mediates the behavior of people in activity systems in specific and objective ways that are realized historically, through a developing cooperation and/or competition in the specialized use of tools arising from the social division of labor (Leont'ev, 1981). Activity systems can stretch out in space and time and multiply through social division of labor to become large, powerful, and immensely varied, as their histories are played out dynamically through the use of a vast range of tools---often including inscriptions as discursive tools.

Activity systems are not static, Parsonian social forces. Rather, they are dynamic systems constantly re-created through micro-level interactions. Each of the three aspects of an activity system changes historically. The identity(ies) of subjects, the focus and direction (object/ motive) of their actions, and their tools-in-use are historically (re)constructed over a few seconds or many centuries. For this reason, activity theory is called a cultural-historical theory.

Activity systems and their social languages (in the Bakhtinian sense of the term) do not operate independently but interact---just as institutions interact in the lives of their participants--by leading and motivating participants to move, individually and collectively, in different directions. Thus, there may be dialectical contradictions that arise in an activity system, as other activity systems pull participants in different directions. These contradictions may be analyzed to trace the genesis of heteroglossic voices, in a classroom or in any other locus in the system. For this version of activity theory, these contradictions are crucial to understanding the circulation of texts (or voices) in both individual and collective behavior.

# GENRE AS OPERATIONALIZED ACTIONS: A SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON LEARNING TO WRITE

Having outlined this systems version of activity theory, I now explain the North American concept of genre as operationalized social action to see how writing, as one kind of tool, mediates activity systems to produce stability. Then, I turn to appropriation, the socialpsychological mechanism by which people change, to analyze how people learn to write new genres. In the following section, I broaden the analysis to the sociological plane to consider Bazerman's (1994a) theory of genre systems and how those systems can be used to trace the ways writing links school and other social practices. The North American school of genre research has a view of genre that is very different from conventional notions of genre as static categories of discourse, a view that, I argue, is very compatible with the systems version of activity theory.' Four points stand out.

First, we must go beyond the conventional notion of genre as a set of formally definable text features that certain texts have in common across various contexts, however defined, and consider genre in relation to social action and social motives. In the view that I am developing, genres can be defined, following Miller (1984), as typified ways of purposefully interacting in and among some activity system(s). Genres are not merely texts that share some formal features; they are shared expectations among some group(s) of people. Genres are ways of recognizing and predicting how certain tools (including vocalizations and inscriptions), in certain typified--typical, reoccurring-- conditions, may be used to help participants act together purposefully. As Bazerman (1994a) says, in this sense, genres are not described best as textual forms but as "forms of life, ways of being, frames for social action. They are environments for learning" and teaching (p. 1). As "forms of life," genres and the activity systems they operationalize (temporarily) are regularized or stabilized through routinized tool use within and among (sub)groups. Thus context is an ongoing accomplishment, not a container for actions or texts. The behavior of individual writers/subjects is constantly re-created through the specific actions of people together. Thus, genres are always only "stabilizedfor-now," in Schryer's (1993) apt phrase.

Second, as the list of mediational tools in Figure 1 suggests, by synthesizing the systems view of activity and the North American view of genre as social action, it is possible to see discourse (vocalizations and inscriptions) as one kind of tool among many others and to relate genres to other kinds of material actions. Thus, the view I am developing differs from the Martin/Rothery school of Hallidayan theory (Martin, 1993), from dialogism (Nystrand, 1986; Wertsch, 1991), and from deconstruction (Derrida, 1980) in that it does not privilege linguistic tools over others. The term genre in this synthesis may apply to the typified use of material tools of many types by an activity system, often in conjunction with one another. Indeed, this term has often been applied to painting, music, clothing, architecture, and so on. For the purposes of analyzing interactions in certain kinds of classrooms and their relation to wider activity systems, genres of manipulating scientific apparatus (Velez, 1995) may be crucial to understanding how writing works powerfully (for computers, see Haas, 1996).

Because of their particular material properties, the sounds people make with their mouths and the marks they make with their hands are tools that have extraordinarily wide uses for (re)constructing systems of human activity. They are very quick and inexpensive to make and, in the case of writing, highly mobile. But there is nothing mysterious about these speech sounds or inscriptions. As widely useful as speaking and writing are, other tools may do the same kinds of jobs, although less efficiently (e.g., gestures for speaking, arrangements of small objects for writing). And there are many interactions that cannot be mediated with speaking or writing. Other tools are essential to the human systems or networks in which work goes on. Indeed, those tools may be more important to particular activity systems or constellations of activity systems, as with architecture (Medway, 1994, in press), art (Smagorinsky & Coppock, 1994, 1995), or engineering (Winsor, 1996). However, as we shall see, inscriptions are particularly suited to constructing long and powerful systems or networks of the modern world, through systems of written genres. Most of my examples are drawn from written genres because this is the focus of my inquiry. However, we must remember that written genres very often are powerfully linked to genres in other media as well, either directly or indirectly.

# Genre Mediates Stability in an Individual's Interactions With Others

A third step in connecting genre to activity theory--and expanding dialogic theory---is to see that written genres help mediate the actions of individuals with others in collectives (activity systems) to create stabilized-for-now structures of action and identity. Y. Engestrom (1987), following Leont'ev (1981), describes three levels or lenses for analyzing genre in systems of activity, which R. Engestrom (1995) expands to analyze genre. I have adapted their analysis in Table 1. In this view, activity systems are made up of specific goal-directed, time-bound, conscious actions, which are, in turn, operationalized by variable mediational means (choices of tools, including genres) in response to conditions.

As R. Engestrom (1995) argues, ordinarily a genre is analyzed best at the level of operation, as a routinized use of some tool(s) or some mediational means to carry out a typified, routine action. This action acts on the object and furthers the motive of some collective activity system. When an individual, dyadic, or collective subject takes some goal-directed action (e.g., taking turn in a conversation or writing an article to persuade an interlocutor, heating water to prepare a meal for a family, or performing a pH test to complete a classroom laboratory experiment), the subject might choose from a range of tools (e.g., lexical and syntactic items, a stove or a barbecue, or types of $\mathtt { p H }$ tests, respectively). That is, there are variable mediational means of accomplishing a goal. If the subject perceives conditions as the same or similar, the subject may act in the same way again. That is, typified actions over time are routinized or operationalized--stabilized-fornow in ways that have proven useful in the activity system. Put in simplest terms, a genre is the ongoing use of certain material tools (marks, in the case of written genres) in certain ways that worked once and might work again, a typified tool-mediated response to conditions recognized by participants as recurring (to paraphrase Miller, 1984).

Table 1 Levels (Lenses) of Analysis of Social-Psychological Functioning   

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Level of Analysis Directing Factor</td><td>Subject</td><td>Perspective</td></tr><tr><td>Activity system</td><td>Object / motive</td><td>Collective (Bakhtinian) social languages)</td><td>Usually unconscious / indetinite in time</td></tr><tr><td>Action</td><td>Specific goal</td><td>Individual, dyad, or group. (Bakhtinian voices)</td><td>Usually conscious / time bound</td></tr><tr><td>Operation</td><td>Conditions</td><td>Individual, dyad, or group. (Bakhtinian speech genres of utterance)</td><td>Usually unconscious / time bound</td></tr></table></body></html>

The first time one takes the action of using a new tool (whether a clutch pedal or a semicolon), it requires a conscious decision to act, but with repeated use, it may become a routine operation, usually unconscious. A routine is, etymologically, a path cut through the woods to make the next trip easier. So it is with genres. Because genres have operationalized many actions recognized to be of the same type, experienced participants in an activity system ordinarily do not need to choose tools each time they take action. The use of some tool in some way is, social-psychologically, a typified response to some need for action with others. Its routinized, operationalized use is a way of continuing to work with others in more or less but never entirely predictable ways. For experienced insiders in a profession, for example, their ways of writing may be so routine that they come to seem natural. In this sense, genre helps account for social-psychological stability, identity, and predictability.

# Genre Mediates Change in Individuals Through Appropriation

A fourth step in connecting genre to activity theory is to see how the concept of genre as operationalized social action helps account for change as well as stability. How do newcomers learn the genres of a discipline or profession? The systems version of activity theory analyzes change in terms of appropriation, a person or dyad or collective picking up some tool-in-use from others.' For newcomers to an activity system--like students learning to write a new genre in a new discipline or profession (to them)--the new ways they use these tools called words are encountered at the level of conscious actions. Through continued interaction with others in the activity system, the ways of using the tool (say, the introduction, methods, results, discussion [IMRD] structure in science) becomes a routine operation, often unconscious. Moreover, as an individual appropriates (learns to use) the ways with words of others, they may (or may not) also appropriate the object/motive, and subjectivity (identity) of the collective, of a new activity system. The process of learning (to write) new genres is a part of a process of expanding one's involvements with activity systems (Y. Engestrom, 1987).

Let us take a simple example of a nonschool and nonprofessional genre to illustrate how genres work in activity systems. My daughter, Madeleine, and I are participants in the activity system of our nuclear family, which must act on an object (groceries) to satisfy a cultural motive (to eat)---which also happens to satisfy a biological motive rather directly. In the broad division of labor in our society, our family activity system interacts with the activity system of a local supermarket, although we could accomplish this goal by variable mediational means: using a farmer's market, local farmers, or taking up farming.

Some years ago, Madeleine and I jotted down a list of items to get at the store and found that this discursive tool made the shopping trip go better, that it helped us carry out some specific. action toward a specific, conscious goal---getting the family's groceries for the week--- that would satisfy an ongoing object/motive of our activity system. Trips to the supermarket are a typified action in our family, and because we found the list a useful tool of interaction with the other activity system, we made another list the next time we went shopping. In time, using a grocery list became a routine, a habit, an operation for us, often unconscious. We do not have to decide each week how to organize and carry out our interaction with the grocery store. The list has become a useful tool of our family's activity system by operationalizing (routinizing) our interaction with another activity system, the weekly trips to the grocery store. It is now one of the genres of our family activity system.

Over the years, the list has changed in response to changing conditions. It has a history. Indeed, I picked up--appropriated---the grocery list genre from seeing my mother make a similar list. It passed from one nuclear family to another related family system, and its cultural history stretches far and wide. It is reconstructed dynamically in response to changing conditions. When the list became long and our time short, my daughter and I organized the list by aisles to save time and then reorganized it when we changed from Cub Foods to SaveU-More. The tools (technologies) we use to (re)construct it have changed. To save time in copying items, we have printed out a list of the items we usually buy and photocopied it to post on the refrigerator.

Its use is recognized by the other family members (and by the grocery sackers who say, "Is this your grocery list?" when we absentmindedly leave it on the counter). They know when we are list making and why, what that paper is on the refrigerator door and why, what happens if they move it (we get irritated). Its use has been appropriated from the dyad to the collective. We even have more or less successfully enlisted the other members of the family to mark the items we need as they run out and add items they want. But the division of labor in the family activity system is preserved. Madeleine and I make the list, and the others complain when we do not return with an item that they marked on the list and do not complain (or complain less) when we do not have an item they wanted but did not put on the list. (The list has become a tool for mediating our arguments and negotiations over the family division of labor.)

Our grocery list is a very simple instance of a written genre, as I will use the term. The first time one or more persons in an activity system (or between activity systems) are confronted with a need to carry out a specific action, to achieve a specific goal, the person(s) must choose some means of action, using some tool(s). If the person(s) perceives that the choice of tools and their use in a certain way has accomplished the goal, the person(s) might choose it again. Over time, people may be confronted with what they perceive as a similar need to act in similar conditions and pick up and use--appropriate- some of the same or similar discursive tool(s) (form of words) in some of the same or similar ways for the same or similar use. That is, they appropriate and perhaps eventually operationalize what they perceive to be similar actions using what they perceive to be similar tools and uses of the tools (ways of writing). They create what I am calling a genre. If what they pick up is inappropriate-does not work--then it does not become operationalized into a genre.

Texts recognized by participants in an activity system as belonging to some genre may not share a specific set of definable formal features (that is, what participants in that activity system, or others such as linguists, point to when asked how they know this is one kind of text and not another). Participants may recognize these texts as belonging to the same written genre as long as these texts are operationalizing the actions of participants in the activity system---which is why views of genre that focus on text features are not very helpful for an activity theory analysis (Kent, 1993).' For example, Witte (1992) found that grocery lists of shoppers in the same market differed significantly in their linguistic features, yet he and the shoppers recognized all the documents as grocery lists. However, not all lists of grocery items are recognized by participants as grocery lists. The store's buyers and stockers have lists of grocery items that mediate their interactions with wholesalers. They call these order forms or stock lists, not grocery lists, because they operationalize ongoing interactions with different activity systems and are tied to a different set of discursive and nondiscursive tools: stockrooms, loading docks, delivery trucks, invoices, inventory lists, cartons, and forklifts instead of the aisles, parking lots, shopping carts, bags, and register receipts associated with a grocery list. How far a generic label will stretch is an empirical question that can be answered only by interviewing and observing participants. Participants' shared recognition of the typified actions that a genre operationalizes is the key to distinguishing one genre from another.

Conversely, texts that share a number of formal features may not belong to the same genre because they are not all used to operationalize the same recurring, typified actions of an activity system. A single text may successfully function as a tool for mediating the actions of participants in more than one activity system. That is, a single text may function as different genres. By this definition of genre, Hamlet is not in the same genre when it is used as a script for actors as when it is used in literary or philological analysis, because each of the three activity systems will use it with a different object/motive-- although there may be much mutual appropriation and one rare individual indeed may be a full participant in all three activity systems, simultaneously a philologist, literary critic, and stage director.10 This becomes crucial in schooling because students doing the "same"

writing task in a classroom may actually be operating out of different activity systems with different motives and writing in different genres from their social-psychological perspectives. Some students summarizing an article on genetic engineering may be doing school (for a grade); others, biology (for a future career); and others, political work (for an activist cause).

Thus, the process of appropriation is not always unidirectional (simple socialization or adaptation) but dialectical. Activity systems and individuals in them are pulled between the object/motives of the multiple activity systems with which they interact. Y. Engestrom (1987, 1993) calls dialectical pulls within and among collectives contradictions and the deep conflicts individuals experience as a result of those contradictions psychological double binds.

Notice that an individual might appropriate some tool-in-use, some way with words, from a new (to her) activity system and use it in an activity system in which she already operates--without appropriating the object/motive and the identity (subjectivity) of the new activity system. For example, when Geisler (1994) compared first-year composition students and graduate students in philosophy writing the same philosophy assignment, the graduate students wrote like academic philosophers, but the first-year students merely appropriated certain discursive tools from philosophy to think through problems they were having in their families--another activity system. They did not write in philosophers' genres and were not motivated to start doing so. Students experience deep difficulties in learning to write new genres because there is clearly more at stake than right and wrong task representations. Their future involvements with powerful social practices and their identities and potential identities are at stake. But we must move from social-psychological to sociological analysis to explore the political and developmental dimensions of writing.

# GENRES IN SYSTEMS: A SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON LEARNING TO WRITE

This activity theory of genre is sociological. It emphasizes the dynamic functional circulation of texts through intertexts---the shifting mediation of change and power over time, historically, among different but interacting social practices. In this section, I argue that genre as operationalized social action is an analytical category useful for understanding both individual behavior (social psychology) and collective behavior (society or culture), allowing us to expand dialogic metaphors to trace writing across activity systems and analyze the relation between school and society. Here, Bazerman's (1994a) theory of genre systems is crucial.

In complex activity systems, including those of formal schooling, there are typically many written genres, which participants use together to organize interactions. Bazerman (1994a) defines genre systems as "interrelated genres that interact with each other in specific settings" (p. 80). In the synthesis I am developing, I describe these settings as activity systems, which genre systems mediate. In the genre system of some activity system, "only a limited range of genres may appropriately follow upon another" (Bazerman, 1994a, p. 80), because the conditions for successful actions in each activity system are conditioned---but never finally determined---by their history of previous actions. At Save-U-More, stock inventory lists generate order forms (from suppliers), which generate checks and receipts; sales reports generate advertising copy (at the local newspaper), and so on. At the Department of Defense, requests for proposals (RFPs) generate funding proposals (from researchers), which generate contracts, which generate reports and experimental articles (from researchers), and so on (Berkenkotter & Rivotas, in press; Devitt, 1991; Freeman & Smart, in press; Van Nostrand, 1997). (Notice that the written genres help organize all sorts of other materials and tools, e.g., foodstuffs, forklifts, chemicals, weapons.)

# Genre Systems Mediate Stability of Structure

Many activity systems use complex systems of written genres to (re-)create and stabilize-for-now their object/motive and collective identity. Because of the division of labor within an activity system, not all of the participants must appropriate (learn to read/write) all of the written genres. Participants at certain more or less (but never entirely) stable positions within the systems interact in ways that make it more likely that they will use certain genres and not others at certain times and not others. In a typical school, for example, the teacher writes the assignments; the students write the responses in classroom genres. The administrators write the grade form; the teachers fill it out. The parents and/or the government officials write the checks; the administrators write the receipts and the transcripts and report to regents (Law, 1994). It is through this microstructural circulation of texts and other tools in genres, these regularized shared expectations for tool use within and among systems of purposeful interaction, that macrosocial structure is (re-)created. And at the same time in the same fundamental way, the identities of individuals and groups and subgroups are (re-)created.

As noted earlier, those who have not interacted routinely with the participants (and tools) of an activity system-newcomers-must appropriate at least some of those routinized tools-in-use (genres) to expand their involvement with others in the activity system. This is part of the process of reproduction, of more or less but never entirely maintaining genres in the face of new conditions. In activity systems in which writing is a tool-in-use, at least some (but usually not all) newcomers must learn to write some (but usually not all) of the written genres, whether the newcomers are patients filling out a form, union leaders revising work rules, biology students learning to write a lab report, or political activists writing banners and lists of demands to carry to a demonstration (and probably filling out parade permit forms). Participants in an activity system must use tools (including writing) in more or less similar ways for the activity system to continue to exist.

Moreover, genre systems mediate the interactions between activity systems---including those interactions between schools and disciplines or professions. The Save-U-More has genres for interacting with unions, suppliers, advertisers, regulators, customers, and so on. The Department of Defense has genres for interacting with researchers, manufacturers, Congress, the press, and so on(VanNostrand, 1997). Schools have written transcripts, placement folders, admissions forms, publicity materials, reports to regents, exit examinations, and so on to interact with employers, parents, legislators, and professions. Through these stabilized-fornow genres, the boundaries and interactions between social practices--- social structures---are maintained in part and power is exerted in regularized ways.

# Genres Systems Mediate Change Dialectically: Contradictions in and Among Activity Systems

Analysis of genres as operationalized social actions not only can help account for the ways writing tends to stabilize collectives (reproduction, social structure, hegemony) but also can help account for the ways writing helps mediate collective change, sometimes called innovation, reform, or revolution. For humans, reproduction is never final, whether social or biological. Through the actions of individuals and groups with tools, interactions between and among activity systems may dialectically change those activity systems over time. Genres also are structured dialectically. The genres of one activity system may be transformed as the interactions with other activity systems change (Freedman & Smart, in press). Genres are always only stabilized-fornow. Because genres are made of people's operationalized actions and because more than one action might be chosen to accomplish a single goal, the operationalized ways of acting with tools may be forsaken at any time, in response to changing conditions. Genres predict--they do not determine--structure. There is always more than one way to skin a rhetorical cat. Thus, the need to interact using stabilized-fornow genres does not imply, as some critics of genre analysis suggest (e.g., Dixon, 1988), that change is one directional and inevitably reproduces existing structures.

People in activity systems mutually appropriate ways of writing from other activity systems. For example, a deeply involved participant in one activity system may appropriate some way with words from one of the other activity systems she is involved in (for an individual may be involved in many activity systems and write in many genres). The new way with words may, in turn, be appropriated and operationalized by others in the collective and in the process alter or transform the old genres. Cross-disciplinary research offers many examples of this (Dogan & Pahre, 1990; Gray, 1996).

Or, as we noticed earlier, a newcomer may appropriate (learn) some tool, some way with words, then carry it back to a familiar activity system and put it to use there--perhaps to a very different use. There, others may appropriate it, transforming that activity system and its genres in the process. For example, students in a general education course of some discipline might apply some way of writing they learned there to meet a need in a family or peer group, even if that need is unrelated to the activity system of the discipline (Geisler, 1994; McCarthy & Fishman, 1991).

Similarly, a newcomer may bring ways of acting with words from one activity system (e.g., a family or workplace) to another (e.g., a classroom or discipline), in which they might be appropriated by the collective to transform its genres. In this sense, a single newcomer may change an activity system as she expands her involvement with it over time. This ordinarily takes a long history of involvement--something students usually do not have. Yet, an influx of newcomers from a different activity system (e.g., open enrollment at City University of New York in the 1970s) or a single newcomer linked to a more powerful activity system (such as a new university president) has great potential to transform the genres of an activity system.

These dialectical changes through appropriation of tools across boundaries are accompanied by conflicts and resistances before conditions are restabilized--if they ever are restabilized (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995). Activity systems experience dialectical contradictions, as other activity systems pull them toward some new motive. Similarly, individuals are pulled between differing object/motives and experience double binds. People come to be at cross-purposes, and these dialectical contradictions are reflected in the genres that operationalize their actions, creating hybrid genres--or complete ruptures in a system of genres.

The dialectical appropriation of tools across boundaries can even change the whole object/motive of a collective. The very object/ motive of the activity system may change under the influence of newcomers, as may the identity and roles of the participants. The (re)construction of the identity of an individual or group is not merely adopting or adapting to a predetermined social role (in the Parsonian sense). It is potentially transforming. The outcome of deep contradictions within an activity system may be a qualitatively different system after interaction with newcomers (and the new tools-in-use they bring to the system). Thus, changes in written genres or other mediational means such as machines may lead to dramatic changes. Activity systems may change virtually overnight, as when a business is sold and retooled to produce a different product (Freedman & Artemeva, in press), or over centuries, as Bazerman (1988) shows in his history of the genre and activity of the experimental article in science. Professions are born and die (Abbott, 1988). Institutions of formal schooling undergo revolutionary change and are transformed (with their genres) almost beyond recognition, as with oratorical education in the late 19th century (Halloran, 1982; Russell, 1991).

# Genre Systems and Power Relations

In this theoretical view, power (social control, domination, hegemony, exclusion, etc.) is not some force that is mysteriously transported or conspiratorially hidden in discourse. Power is analyzable in terms of dialectical contradictions in activity systems, manifest in specific tools-in-use (including written genres) that people marshal when they are at cross-purposes. Nor are genres, in this view, Foucauldian capillaries, micro-level conduits carrying power (Foucault, 1981). Rather, genres come historically to fully mediate human interactions in such a way that some people (and some tools) have greater and lesser influence than others because of their dynamic position(s) in tool-mediated systems or networks. The technology (tool) we call writing--the deployment of inscriptions--is an extremely flexible and handy amplifier of involvements. The modern world, with its vast reaches of power, is impossible without the string of data inscriptions in the vertical file (or today, the electronic file) (Yates, 1989). Writing can make long strings to be pulled---but only if those strings are attached (networked) to other mediational means (money, buildings, demarcated spaces, machines, weapons, etc.). To understand power in modern social practices, one must follow the genres, written and otherwise. Power appears in specific, locatable occasions of mediated action and is created in the network of many localized instances. It is not an inchoate climate of force or terror, although such atmospheres and responses are (re-)created by the operationalizing of specific actions in mediated activity systems.

This activity theory view complements some versions of cultural studies such as those of Ohmann (1976, 1987) and Trimbur (1993), who find inadequate the structuralist accounts of class, race, gender, and other such static sociological categories (whether Parsonian, Althusserian, or other). "Rather," to quote Ohmann (1987), "in all my doings from day to day I and the people I mingle with and am affected by constantly create my class position"---and, I would add, positions of race, gender, profession, family, religion, and so on. What an activity theory of genre offers is a way to carry on a principled and concrete analysis of the microstructural mingling of people with mediating tools (including writing) in their circulation. In this view, power, race, hegemony, gender, class, and so on are not "permanent fact" but "something that continually happens" though microstructural mediation in activity systems (Ohmann, 1987, p. 286, quoted in Trimbur, 1993, p. 392). It allows us to trace-as Ohmann (1976) has called for--the concrete relations between writing instruction and wider macrostructural social formations. (The military-industrial complex was most on Ohmann's mind) (see also Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Frankenberg, 1993).

# AN EXAMPLE: SYSTEMS OF WRITTEN GENRESIN INTERMEDIATE BIOLOGY COURSES

How might we use this synthesis of activity theory and genre theory to analyze writing and learning to write in the interactions among higher education and other social practices? In this section, I develop an extended example from cell biology to see how we can trace the relation between school and society though the genre systems that operationalize actions in various activity systems. The example is hypothetical but based on the growing literature about writing and learning in U.S. undergraduate biology courses (e.g., Conrad, 1996; Haas, 1994; McCarthy, 1987; Rivard, 1994; Velez, 1995) and social studies of knowledge in biology (e.g., Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Latour & Woolgar, 1986; Myers, 1990).

A university or comprehensive secondary school (as the very names imply) brings together a wide range of other activity systems with vastly different and often contradictory object/motives, because it exists to select and (perhaps) prepare students for a wide range of further involvements with them. And the written genres that mediate the interactions between school and society are myriad. Let us focus on one of those boundary interactions and its genres: a research university and the profession of cell biology. Figure 2 sketches the genre system of a hypothetical intermediate cell biology course. Some of the most salient activity systems in terms of the written genre system are indicated by triangles: the professor's research lab, the course, and the university administration. In the lower left vertex of each triangle, in italics, are the subjects/agents involved in face-toface interaction directly (Goffman's [1988] interaction order). The object/motive of each activity system (from the point of view of the professor, at least) is indicated in italics by the right vertex. The top vertex presents a small number of the genres that mediate interactions between activity systems (mainly written genres, because that is the focus of our analysis). There are also a huge range of what Medway (in press) calls informal written genres, such as marginal notes, scribbles, and e-mail, as well as bureaucratic genres such as rolls, grade forms, drop/add slips, and so on. There are also genres that are oral, gestural, mechanical, architectural, monetary, and so on. Certain genres are also the outcome or product of the activity systems' functioning. Some of these are indicated by black arrows in Figure 2.

# The Genre System of Cell Biology

Although we could begin our analysis at any point in the systems, let us first look at the genre system of cell biology, starting from the researcher's point of view, before considering the genre system of the university, in which we start with the students' points of view. A major activity system the professor operates in is cell biology, of which her research lab is a subactivity system (there are many other similar labs in the activity system of cell biology).

As Myers (1990, 1992) and others in the sociology of science describe it, research biology depends on the commodification of knowledge in various genres-a key term in understanding writing in school and society. Ethnographic studies of highly specialized biology research labs, most notably Latour and Woolgar (1986), have described the primary product of such research labs as experimental articles---a genre--addressed to other highly specialized researchers in other research labs studying similar problems. Researchers use each others' texts in the genre to make arguments about the object of their activity (some aspect of cells). The claims researchers make in the genre of the experimental article are highly qualified and contested, supported by copious intertextual citations to other documents such as data files and other experimental articles. As some of those claims come to be accepted as (provisionally) true by the community of researchers in that area, they are operationalized (or blackboxed, in Latour's [1987] term) as taken-for-granted facts of the activity system.12

These statements, forged in the heat of controversy among researchers in some highly specialized area, are translated (Latour's [1987] term) and commodified into another genre research scientists write: research reviews. These research reviews mediate the lab's boundary interactions with other activity systems of research in related disciplines (e.g., medicine, ecology)---and potentially mediate its influence (power). Typically, research reviews do not cite directly the genres of data or lab notes but only other experimental articles. In this way, researchers commodify their discursive tools for use by other activity systems that have different objects/motives, such as studying a disease or an ecosystem. In Figure 2, commodification in the genre system is indicated by the longer arrows.

Notice that the activity system of cell biology research is not confined to universities. It also extends into boundary activity systems of drug companies, government medical research facilities, and so on.

Here, experimental articles and reviews also are produced by government and commercial laboratories. But these boundary activity systems also produce other written genres: RFPs, proposal reviews, and contracts. University research labs respond with other genres: grant proposals, reports, and so on (Myers, 1990; Van Nostrand, 1997). Yet, we have only begun to trace the commodification, distribution, exchange, and circulation of discursive (and other) tools by means of the written genre system of this profession.

Some genres of a research lab eventually may be commodified further into other genres for those in more distant activity systems. In activity systems of formal schooling, we have genres of textbooks, with various degrees of commodification from first-grade science to graduate school. Statements forged in the heat of highly technical controversy are cooled and hardened (at least for a time) into truths. In these textbook genres, statements more or less are stripped of textual indications of the disputes among researchers that gave birth to them, such as qualifications, intertextual citations, and descriptions of laboratory method. In that constellation of activity systems called the public, we have genres of popularized science, in which there may be almost none of the features that characterize experimental articles. These highly commodified statements in various popular genres are what introductory students, patients, clients, customers, newspaper readers, TV viewers, voters, and so on are presented with as factual information: Our bodies are made of cells, Shakespeare wrote 39 plays, flossing prevents gum disease (Bazerman, 1988, 1994b; Fahnestock, 1986; Geisler, 1994; Latour, 1987; Myers, 1990, 1996). As we shall see, these various activity systems of schools and publics, such as advocacy groups, can have a dialectical influence (power) on research laboratories through other genres in the system of cell biology.

# The Genre System of a Research University

We now turn to the genre system of a research university. From the point of view of many and perhaps most students, the university is a place to expand their involvement, to a greater or lesser extent, with one or more of the activity systems that intersect with the university. Expanding involvement typically leads to becoming an active participant in one or more activity systems, to maintain and perhaps transform that activity system. Within the university, students come to position themselves within one or more of these intersecting activity systems to "make a difference," in Giddens's (1984) phrase. To do so, one must become involved---literally enrolled--in the highly regularized genre systems of the university (such as grade reports, transcripts, certificates, catalogs, forms, and so on) that operationalize the actions of participants in the activity system in (usually) routine ways. A university is one way into the genre system of some discipline or profession. Through it, a student may come to recognize, appropriate, participate in---and perhaps transform, in ways small or large---the genres that operationalize some of these disciplinary/professional activity systems, the kinds of writing that help make these forms of life (and, eventually, the student's life) work.

From the point of view of a discipline or profession, the university supplies resources not only for research but also for selecting and preparing future professionals. It is a site of selection, sorting, or reproduction, in Bourdieu's (1990) sense of preserving the social (and power) relations of the discipline. But at times, the university also is a site for expansive innovation, for preparing students to respond in new ways to changing conditions of a discipline's or profession's functioning among other activity systems that supply resources and use its products (Clark, 1987). In industrial societies, disciplines and professions sometimes recognize the need to change, to expand their system and sometimes transform it--although the ways an activity system should expand and (re-)form are always a matter of contestation within an activity system and among activity systems. And disciplines and professions must occasionally change the ways they write and teach students to write to accomplish changes in their activity systems (as with engineering, pharmacy, nursing, and finance, which have all recently instituted writing reforms in higher education, calling for WAC in response to perceived changes in their professions).

The activity system of a research university, as an institutional entity, not only has important interpenetrating boundaries with various academic disciplines and professions (as the presence of a research lab suggests), but also has genre-mediated interactions with the government (e.g., a board of regents), which supplies funds and many genres such as laws and policies; with secondary schools, which supply many genres of written records as well as oral and written genres that students appropriate from their secondary school work (e.g., five-paragraph themes); and, most important, with numerous families and peer groups, who supply students and funds, as well as many (primarily oral) genres that the students bring to their actions in the university (Mulvaney, 1997; Prior, in press; Walvoord &

McCarthy, 1991). The university also interacts with various publics, including advocacy groups of many kinds, which may exert influence on the university through their own genres.

# The Genre System of Intermediate Cell Biology: Classroom Genres

We now turn to the genre system of a classroom. The activity system of an intermediate cell biology course, like any other course, forms a complex, stabilized-for-now site of boundary work (Gieryn, 1983) between the activity system of a discipline/profession (cell biology) and that of the educational institution. The boundaries are both maintained and changed through systems of written genres, which extend to myriad activity systems with which cell biology and the university have interactions (as noted above). Thus, the dialogic classroom interactions of teachers and students are linked intertextually, if indirectly, to other social practices (see Figure 2). By tracing those genres through the systems they operationalize, one can analyze perhaps more fully students' and teachers' reading and writing than by appeal to the broad notion of social languages that dialogism uses to describe those interactions.

Following Christie (1993; Christie & Martin, 1997), I call the genres that routinely mediate the dialogic interactions of a course classroom genres, genres that develop in educational activity systems to operationalize teaching and learning--as well as selection. There are myriad written genres, such as dissertations, theses, research papers, essays, book reports, precis, lab reports, and so on (not to mention oral, gestural, architectural, and other genres). In an intermediate biology course, for example, students might read an intermediatelevel textbook, research reviews, and laboratory procedures, and write essay answers, research summaries, and lab reports (Haas, 1994; McCarthy, 1987; Velez, 1995).

This activity theory analysis of genres suggests how classroom genres are linked intertextually to written genres of the university activity system: Student papers are commodified into grades placed on student papers, which then are further commodified in grade reports, which are collated into transcripts, and so on. These genres then help to operationalize the more or less (but never entirely) routine interactions among activity systems that interact with the university. Thus, the system of written genres extends beyond the classroom, spatially and temporally, as transcripts, diplomas, and other documents become tools for helping students select---and to select students for---further, deeper, and more powerful involvements.

However, classroom genres also are linked intertextually to genres of cell biology as an activity system. The professor may have students read a cell biology textbook that takes statements from research reviews of experimental articles written by research scientists and commodifies them to summaries. In an intermediate-level course, students also may read some actual research reviews--other commodifications. Intertextual links with genres in the activity system of cell biology make the classroom genres students write resemble the genres of biologists as well: Student lab reports recapitulate the generic structure of experimental articles, summaries resemble research reviews, and essay answers resemble textbook prose (Conrad, 1996; Diaz et al., in press). Historically, curricula in secondary and university education have commodified genres of professional practice to mediate the boundary between the profession/discipline and the educational institution (Russell, 1991).

# CONTRADICTIONS AND CHANGE IN AND AMONG ACTIVITY SYSTEMS

Thus far, I have sketched only the "normal" or stabilized-for-now functioning of classroom genre systems and the activity systems they mediate. But because an activity system constantly interacts with other activity systems, because participants themselves have many affiliations (identities, subject positions) with many other activity systems, ongoing social practices constantly change as tools-in-use are appropriated across boundaries and eventually are operationalized (sometimes in new written genres) to transform activity systems. Y. Engestrom's (1987) analysis of contradictions in activity systems leads to an analysis of the ways written genre systems mediate change in activity systems. As an activity system interacts with other activity systems in a complex dialectic of boundary work, contradictions arise that drive changes in an activity system and its participants, individually and collectively, as well as in the genres that mediate dynamic activity. An activity system constantly works through contradictions (Y. Engestrom, 1987). In this sense, an activity system "is a virtual disturbance- and innovation-producing machine" (Y. Engestrom, 1990, p. 11). But these contradictions are not merely micro-level conflicts over the means (actions and operations) to a shared end (object/motive). They are fundamental dialectical contradictions about the object/motive of an activity system, the direction of collective activity, and they require fundamental choices with long-term consequences for the activity system, which threaten or promise (depending on one's point of view) a new form of activity. Moreover, these contradictions involve material tools beyond writing and speaking, tools of all kinds, such as machines and money and real estate--- literal turf.

These macro-level contradictions extend over time and condition but never finally determine micro-level actions and social-psychological operations through which those actions are carried out, at times leading to qualitative transformations of the activity system, such as a different direction (object/motive). When people are at crosspurposes, pulled by contradictory objects and motives, systems are stretched, and sometimes fundamentally transformed. At the level of the individual, people experience double binds, seemingly irreconcilable demands placed on them by the pull of two competing motives. Eventually, individuals' agency or identity may be transformed.

To continue our example (see Figure 2), students at various points in their negotiations with universities are forced to announce a choice of career or life direction and may experience social-psychological stress in the choice of a major. Students may be forced to choose a direction away from activity systems of family, neighborhood, and friends that construct ethnic, racial, gender, and class identity(ies). This forced choice may cause students to experience double binds. What is considered learning to the university or a disciplinary activity system may be perceived by other activity systems of family or neighborhood as selling out. The simplest actions in choosing discursive tools--for example, writing a paper in a certain genre or even using a formal term from a discipline rather than a familiar one from family or friends--may cause deep tension, and understandably so. These actions are linked to new objects and motives, to new and often strange people, to future and sometimes frightening changes in identity, to loss as well as gain. Many qualitative studies of students in activity systems of higher education describe students wrestling with identity conflicts and contradictions in learning to write in the disciplines(Berkenkotter, Huckin, & Ackerman, 1991; Chiseri-Strater, 1991; Greene, 1993; McCarthy & Fishman, 1991; Mulvaney, 1997; Prior, in press; Rose, 1989; Velez, 1995).

Instructors also experience double binds through the deep contradictions in and among activity systems. The interaction (mediated through genre systems) between boundary activity systems and the activity system of research cell biologists produces contradictions and double binds, as activity systems move in different directions or have different objects/motives. For example, to gain funding from some outside source (the National Institute of Health or a drug company), a research lab might have to change its direction (motive) and take up different problems (objects), or at least appropriate some of the discourse of the funding activity systems to write a successful grant proposal--a proposal that would frame the lab's work in terms of furthering the object/ motive of the funder (Myers, 1985, 1990). Hence, there is a contradiction between what is sometimes called pure and applied research. Or a contradiction may arise when a lab must chose between funding from a for-profit and funding from a nonprofit activity system, between the use value and the market value of the lab's products. In the interaction with the activity system of the university, cell biologists may experience a contradiction between teaching and research. Similarly, the university may be pulled by the demands of disciplinary activity systems for strict selection-what they perceive as "excellence"--and the demands of activity systems such as families, political institutions, and, often, labor unions for less strict selection-what they perceive as "equity" (Clark, 1987). The systems of written genres are pulled--sometimes apart---by these contradictions, these people at cross-purposes. And students and teachers in classrooms in part must negotiate these contradictions textually, in learning and teaching with writing.1' In the remainder of this article, I will point to three of the many problems of writing research that might be rethought in terms of contradictions and double binds by tracing intertextual genre systems among school and society.

# Analyzing Students' Agency and Identity as Writers in Relation to Disciplines

One central set of problems in current writing research is analyzing how writers develop and exert agency, identity, voice---and power--- in the face of what appear to be hegemonic social forces or social languages (cf. Berlin, 1996). The activity theory of genre I am developing suggests that individual students feel the contradictions between and among activity systems of school and society as double binds about whether to involve themselves primarily as consumers of a discipline's or profession's commodified tools (knowledge) in distant genres, to place themselves on the periphery of its activity system, or to become involved actively in its life through deeper participation--to throw themselves into it through the reading/writing of its genres, to make a difference as well as make a grade. Of course, students cannot become deeply involved in all the disciplines of their courses unless they are pursuing an extremely narrow professional curriculum. Hence, they must make difficult choices for and about themselves when they write.

The development (reconstruction) of individual agency and identity means expanding (or refusing to expand) involvement with an activity system by appropriating its object/motive, which requires the appropriation (and sometimes transformation) of certain of its genres. As we have seen, individuals may be active participants in (identify themselves with) a number of the activity systems, sometimes with contradictory motives. For example, one student in a graduate course may also be a worker in a research lab, a graduate student union officer, a member of the African American Students Association, a Democratic precinct chair, and a patient. One researcher may also be a teacher, a voter, a patient, a member of Act Up, a science journalist, and so on. As individuals are pulled in different directions, they experience double binds manifest in their writing, which may be resolved by their coming to appropriate the object/motive of some activity system(s) as they appropriate its genres---and as they resist or refuse appropriating others.

Figure 3 is a rough attempt to sketch some wider genre systems of cell biology. One might construct a similar diagram for any discipline/ profession, including those in the humanities, to help visualize the ways writing mediates the (re)construction of knowledge, agency, and power. And one might sketch the genre systems from any point of view, not just that of researchers.

As in the previous diagram, each triangle represents an activity system interacting, through written genres, with cell biology research (lower left), and the small arrows represent the circulation of texts in the genre systems.4 As the large arrow on the left indicates, the diagram suggests a process of increasing commodification of the statements of researchers as they are translated into other written genres for use by boundary activity systems, including those of formal schooling. From the discipline's point of view, the genre system extends from the experimental articles of researchers through practitioners in related fields to various publics such as patients, clients, legislatures, and so on--those at the furthest reaches of involvement with the activity system (the top of the diagram). Here are the brochures one reads in the doctor's office (produced by medical professionals and public relations departments of public health agencies and drug companies) and the reports of discoveries one reads in mass-circulation newspaper stories and popularizations (typically produced by science journalists). The ovals on the left suggest levels of schooling as they interact intertextually with cell biology research.

Figure 3. A sketch of mediating interactions with some genre systems' cell biology research NOTE: RFPs $=$ requests for proposals; ${ \sf N H H } =$ National Institutes of Health.

However, we could begin the analysis with some other activity system to which cell biology researchers are peripheral. Thus, this diagram also suggests the range of ways that individuals and groups--including students---can affect the activity system of researchers indirectly, through genre-mediated interactions with organizations that bring to bear pressure on related fields. Various publics produce texts in various genres that are used by those in related fields and sometimes by researchers themselves (downward arrows). Among these are responses on forms (collected in data files and vote tallies, summarized by related activity systems such as election commissions and epidemiologists in government research agencies), letters of complaint and lawsuits (from clients/patients), laws and regulations (from legislatures and regulators), and position papers, lawsuits, and direct mail campaigns (from advocacy groups and lobbying organizations). Statements in these genres affect researchers indirectly as they are translated into genres such as RFPs, which may influence the direction of research if they are linked sufficiently to statements in other written genres (vote tallies, appropriations, checks, etc.) and, more important, other material tools (buildings, machines, etc.) (Whitley, 1984).

The written genres that typically mediate that downward influence, or power, typically are not written by cell biology researchers but by people in related (usually professional) activity systems: science journalism, medical professions, granting agencies, drug companies, science education, and so on. Yet, there is always the possibility that other activity systems (even previously unrelated ones) can introduce new written genres into a system to mediate change--as with sit-in demonstrations and their written genres of the placard and the list of demands.

An analysis of intertextual genre systems can help students, teachers, and curriculum reformers trace students' involvements with various activity systems related to the discipline and in the process see options for introducing and changing genres in a course or curricu$\scriptstyle \mathbf { l u m } ,$ for tracing the strings that must be pulled, in textual or other ways, to mobilize people and gain power--as with the successful campaign for increases in breast cancer research funding (Altman, 1996).

The classroom genres of formal education use a range of written genres between these extremes of experimental article and newspaper article popularization, theoretical treatise and informational brochure in the clinic. These genres of schooling also are linked to various publics through the genres of educational institutions, primarily, in enrollment reports, mission statements of priorities, diplomas, and so on, as noted in Figure 2. The closer one comes in the genre system of the discipline to the activity systems of research, the closer the genres resemble the genres of researchers, and vice versa. In this way, the commodified tools of the discipline--its factual information-are circulated in the genre system, and future participants are selected for further involvement. From students' perspectives, they have access to discursive and other material tools for expanding their involvement from the abstract and commodified content of a course into the ongoing activity systems of various social practices. Students must negotiate their identity(ies) in part through this network of stabilizedfor-now genres and the contradictory motives of various activity systems those genres mediate.

For example, Casanave (1992) tells the story of a first-year Hispanic graduate student in sociology wrestling unsuccessfully with writing assignments in theory courses. "Everyday" English and Spanish "came to be less valuable to her over time as tools for communicating her ideas about her work with friends and family in that they were not valued as resources for communication within the [sociology] department"' (p. 161). From the activity theory perspective, she experienced a double bind between the discipline's object/motive and those of family and peer group. Moreover, contradictions within the activity system of research sociology between positivist and hermeneutic approaches (made salient in the writing assignments) left her unable to reconcile the motive that drew her into the discipline--helping women, minorities, and educators in culturally mixed neighborhoods--- with the motive of the most powerful wing of sociology. Alienated, she dropped out to become a researcher in a nonprofit Puerto Rican educational and advocacy organization in New York. But in one sense, she regretted leaving because she sensed she might have more power to make a difference if she stayed in a more widely influential-- powerful---position in the disciplinary system as currently constituted--- academic research and theory: "Having a Masters in sociology is not enough to get people to listen to the ideas of a young Puerto Rican woman" (p. 173). In effect, she chose the object/motive (and genres) of a boundary activity system, knowing that it (currently) had less power, because she chose not to appropriate the object/motive (and genres) of positivist sociology.

Teachers may pick up students' ways with words. But students more often appropriate the discursive tools (and genres) of a discipline or profession because those involvements can yield greater agency and power- empowerment, in the honorific phrase. The much longer and "better-disciplined" activity system of the discipline usually involves many more people and their tools than the activity systems of individual students (their family and peer networks, for example). Individual students or even groups of students have not typically involved themselves sufficiently and marshaled the resources-connections with people and things--over time to get disciplines to appropriate their ways with words (although organizations of students have often done so through collective action, as in France in 1968 [Fraser, 1988]).

It is possible that an individual student might do something with a classroom genre that the professor might appropriate for his research, although this is infrequent because of the differences in motive/object and tools-in-use (including financial resources) of the students and the researchers--the distance between the activity systems of the course and the research lab. Students typically do not have a sufficient history of interactions with the system to have much agency or power in professional networks. They are not (yet) in a position to pull the strings even if they know where they are and which ones would be likely to effect the changes they desire. As Bazerman (1993), Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995), and Kress (1993) point out, most students are not in a position to challenge the genres (and, therefore, forms of life) of powerful disciplinary systems. I would add the obvious: They will never be if they do not develop a history of interactions with the discipline, by appropriating (and in doing so potentially transforming) the genres through which it interacts with other activity systems (including schools, governments, advocacy groups, etc.). In any case, this theoretical synthesis may offer new tools for analyzing the relation of micro-level dialogic classroom interactions to the wider social forces, or power arrangements, in ways that allow more fine-grained tracing of the circulation of texts (and power) than is possible with theories that do not have a systematic means of doing so.

# Analyzing Students' Text-Based or Arhetorical Approaches to Writing

A second set of problems this synthesis of activity theory and North American genre theory may help us analyze has to do with what has sometimes been called task representation (Flower, 1994). Undergraduates often do not see their writing in the same ways as do instructors. Walvoord and McCarthy (1991) argue that students ordinarily have a "text-based" approach to learning, similar to what Geisler (1994) calls an "arhetorical'" approach to writing (see Prior's [in press] critique). Haas (1994) summarizes research studies that suggest 'beginning college students approach academic tasks as if they believe that texts are autonomous and context free. Treating tasks as if they believe that texts are autonomous and context free may be facilitated both by features of academic discourse itself . . . and by a culture of schooling that encourages students to see texts primarily as repositories of factual information" (p. 46).

Activity theory suggests that students do not perceive texts as context free or arhetorical. They perceive that schooling is the context---the activity system--that these genres primarily mediate. Texts appear context free to students because beginning courses in the activity system of schooling are only at the distant boundary of the activity system of the discipline. Students often do not see the relevance of their writing to the discipline or other social practices-or they see it and refuse involvement. They produce dull prose, from the instructor's point of view, as the genres of student writing are distant from instructors' own research genres and activities.

Students and professors rightly perceive classroom genres as operating in the genre system of the university more immediately and directly than in the genre system of a discipline (Anson & Forsberg, 1990; Freedman & Adam, in press; Freedman, Adam, & Smart, 1994; Freedman & Medway, 1994; Russell & Booker, 1997). They perceive their involvement in terms of the object/motive of schooling, the grade or certification. Students' papers are graded by the professor, and those grades are marked on the paper and on a grade report form (another written genre), collated with other grades on a student grade report and eventually on transcripts, diplomas, reports to parents, the legislature, news media, and so on. Most students are doing school most of the time, not disciplinary work. In most courses, they are not motivated by a desire for further involvement in the discipline to the extent they could appropriate its object/motive, or choose it as a life direction.

In introductory general or liberal education courses particularly, students often are constructed by the disciplines as outsiders, at the furthest boundary of a disciplinary activity system's interaction with educational activity systems. The vast majority of students will have no ongoing future interaction with the disciplinary activity system outside of the activity system of school, except perhaps as future consumers (patients, clients, voters) of its most highly commodified products (including genres). Consequently, in these courses, we find highly commodified classroom genres, usually textbooks, whose statements are only loosely connected intertextually to the day-to-day workings of the professional activity system, statements that are so old and thoroughly operationalized as to be unconscious, tacit assumptions---to researchers.

For most students, however, those commodified statements are not yet operationalized actions of the discipline. The students are acting only on the edges of its collective life. Statements in these commodified genres constitute what is sometimes called the material or content of general/liberal education. As these metaphors of physical objects suggest, the statements tend to be commodified, stripped of the process of their construction within the activity system, which over a long period of time gradually has been operationalized by participants. These "facts" are abstractions to most students most of the time, removed from the concrete life of the discipline---though abstractions can be useful.

These abstract, commodified tools are offered as discrete facts, often to be memorized---facts whose immediate use may be viewed by students in terms of a grade (a tool used to mediate the selection motive of the educational institution) but also, potentially, as tools for some unspecified further interaction with some social practice outside school. However, because students have not sufficiently specialized--- appropriated the motive of a professional activity system--those potential uses remain vague. The abstract, commodified statements are waiting to be picked up and used by students motivated to expand, through further actions, into the concrete life of the disciplinary activity system. Those further actions in the life of the discipline eventually will be operationalized for some students as they become experienced participants in the disciplines. The genres of the textbook, class notes, and so on mediate certain kinds of disciplinary involvement and forestall others. But as commodified tools, the connection between the discourse and the activity system that produced and commodified them usually is not immediately apparent, any more than the myriad factory processes are apparent in a consumer product on the supermarket shelf. To realize that connection, students must have a longer, deeper history of involvement with the discipline. Indeed, as Roland (1988) found, first-year university students asked to read research literature of their disciplines sometimes react with dismay and fear at the prospect of involving themselves with people who write in those arcane ways.

A different but related set of problems arises when instructors have students read/write popular genres drawn from activity systems at the furthest edge of the discipline's activity system. For example, as Walvoord and McCarthy (1991) describe, when a production management professor had students evaluate various sites for a stadium, he expected them to write using the quantitative tools of his field in a genre similar to those of his discipline/profession. He was dismayed to find that the students wrote in genres of the popular press and peer groups, without reference to the genres of the discipline he was teaching them. Because classrooms exist on the boundaries of various activity systems and embody contradictions in objects/motives, professors and students must negotiate the double binds they experience when they assign or write genres that are linked to activity systems far apart in the genre system. Will an instructor choose textbook genres that remain abstractions for most students but are firmly tied to her activity system, or will she choose (or allow students to choose) popular genres that bear only indirectly on the material of the course (and, hence, are suspect by the discipline)? Will students choose to put themselves into the writing of classroom genres that bear a dim relation to the activity systems of their life-worlds, or will they write in the familiar genres of their life-worlds that are only loosely connected to the genres of the discipline/profession (and, hence, suspect)?

In composition courses, the problem of selecting genres is even more difficult because the range of genres--and activity systems the students might involve themselves in---is so vast and the connection with specific disciplines so distant and tenuous. I suggest elsewhere in an activity theory analysis of first-year college writing instruction (Russell, 1995) that composition students have particular difficulty seeing the connection between their writing and other social practices. Students tend to write in the classroom genre of the five-paragraph theme, which has a history almost exclusively educational. In composition courses as elsewhere in schooling, problems of what to read/write may benefit from systematic analysis of the subjectivities, objects, and motives that link classroom genres to wider social practices.

# Analyzing Institutional Selection/Assessment and Student Motivation for Writing

A third set of problems in writing research that this synthesis of activity theory and genre theory may elucidate has to do with the crucial role of writing in selection/assessment (White, Lutz, & Kamusikiri, 1996). Applebee (1996) and others develop the metaphor of scaffolding to describe the classroom/curricular experiences instructors and students coconstruct to facilitate learning. From the perspective I am developing, scaffolding means offering students tools-in-use (including written genres) that lead to wider involvements with some activity system or systems. Yet, schooling is always part of the rhetorical process of facilitating and retarding and rejecting the entry of individuals and groups into various activity systems (Diaz et al., in press). Thus, when we examine the metaphor from a wider perspective, scaffolds are not linear but branching, messy--and contested. Instructors and the disciplines and schools they represent must construct scaffolds (in part by selecting classroom genres) in such a way as to lead students in several directions, into related disciplines/ professions. And because not everyone can or should enter every profession, instructors must make some of the rungs in the scaffold hard to reach and others easier, sorting some students up some generic rout(in)es through the scaffold and others up other generic rout(in)es. Various stakeholders---other disciplines/professions, families, advocacy groups, and so on---may pressure instructors and disciplines to reconstruct the scaffold in various directions, making some routes up it smoother, others more difficult. Dialectical contradictions surface.

Thus, one central kind of contradiction played out in the choice of classroom genres, for both instructors and students, might be called selection versus introduction. Let us return to the hypothetical introductory cell biology course. In the process of recruitment and exclusion, selection and rejection, that goes on constantly in the activity systems of higher education at all levels, some students may select (and be selected by) the activity system of the instructor: disciplinary research. But only a fraction of the students in even an intermediate cell biology course can or want to become researchers in cell biology. This is selection.

The majority of students will pursue one or more different--- although related--directions in various other activity systems that have boundaries with cell biology (science education, medicine, veterinary, science journalism, agronomy, sociology of science, etc.). These related disciplines/professions require their students to take intermediate cell biology because they will likely have to use some of its discursive and other material tools in their future professional activity and interact with its system of genres. Consequently, the instructor is pushed to offer students a wide range of the activity system's commodified tools (such as research reviews and diagnostic procedures), which students will use if they move into related activity systems. This is introduction.

After being introduced to the commodified tools of the activity system of cell biology, these students will appropriate them for some use outside-although often bounding---the activity system of research in cell biology. But ordinarily, they will not go beyond the introduction. Because students will take many paths through many related activity systems, instructors and disciplines must decide what tools/ genres to offer to accomplish both selection for their own activity system (specialization) and introduction to a broader range of tools useful to participants in related activity systems. The choice of genres students will read and write thus involves difficult negotiations. What will be relevant to whom and for what object/motive?

For her discipline to continue (reproduction) and grow (transformation), the professor must attempt to skim the cream and pour away the rest, but in such a way that enough of the rest will carry away with them useful tools for other related activity systems. Powell (1985) describes the double binds he faced in choosing writing assignments for students in his chemistry course. Teaching and learning to write chemistry becomes deeply problematic in modern educational institutions. Blakeslee (1997) describes a physics professor's struggle to help a graduate student write a sophisticated experimental article when the student resists the genre and instead writes the commodified genre of descriptive report. The student eventually leaves for a related discipline.

Students experience the selection/introduction contradiction in double binds over their potential further participation in the activity systems of the discipline and related disciplines, over their choice of major and further professional and life commitments. The students must negotiate their involvement with the material and the writing assignments, from full-scale appropriation of the discipline's object/ motive to an abject rejection of and resistance to it. The students' past interactions and the constructions of the motives they bring with them, their directions in entering the classroom, intersect with the object/motive of the discipline in the writing they do. They must decide the degree to which they will put themselves into it.

Some highly motivated students (from the perspective of the discipline) may have already appropriated the object/motive of the activity system through extensive earlier interactions with it, which also are mediated by various genres: family talk, hall talk with previous instructors or employers, extensive reading of popularized genres related to the activity system, and friends or e-mail discussants in the activity system (Chiseri-Strater, 1991; Mulvaney, 1997). For these students, the grade may merely be a confirmation of their direction, a marker on a path already laid out---or an obstacle in their chosen life direction.

Some of the cell biology students may appropriate the object/ motive of the activity system of cell biology during the course and become majors, perhaps with the help of related involvements. For example, Haas (1994) describes how for Liza, a biology major, the genres of biology came to make sense in large part through her job as an assistant in a research lab, in which she encountered the discursive tools of biology in active use with the other material tools and people in the discipline (see also Velez, 1995).

Others students may appropriate various tools potentially useful for involvements with related activity systems, professional or otherwise, but not the object/motive of the activity system of the course. For example, McCarthy and Fishman (1991) describe two students who initially resist a philosophy professor's attempts to get them to connect the "personal concerns with philosophic techniques of analysis" (p. 432) and the professor who initially feels conflicts at allowing students to appropriate and transform knowledge from philosophy to their involvements in nonacademic activity systems---although all come to see the usefulness of appropriation across boundaries. North (1986) describes a Jamaican student in a philosophy class who feels great tension between the genre of the "formal paper" (her words; p. 240) and the genres of journal and autobiography her professor requires of her, which typically do not mediate classroom or disciplinary interactions. Students ask, in effect, what (activity) am I doing here? What (activity system) am I getting myself into? What are the stakes (for a grade, for my future) of writing in the ways (genres) these people write? A great deal of trust is necessary to get students to appropriate tools across boundaries, to violate the disciplinary and classroom genres in an environment in which they will be graded (see also Geisler, 1994).

The operationalized ways with words that students and teachers bring to the classroom as their legacy of involvement with other activity systems and their object/motives---the genres read and written and spoken and otherwise--are mutually appropriated (or resisted) in the ongoing dance of selection, depending on the stakes involved for the various stakeholders. Having some means of analyzing the role of writing in selection is crucial because students and teachers (and many other stakeholders in schooling) need more powerful theoretical tools for helping them decide what kinds of things to read and write in classrooms of various kinds---and when.

If we have a principled way of tracing the dynamic circulation of genres, the intertextual links between classrooms and families and ethnic neighborhoods, disciplines and professions, business and government and advocacy groups, and so on, then the role of writing in selection may be clarified. And with activity theory and genre systems as analytical tools, it might be easier to say why some way of using writing in learning work well or poorly (from students' and teachers' and other stakeholders' perspectives). In other words, one can go beyond tracing the dialogic, heteroglossic voices of the classroom, with their intertextual links, to trace the wider investments participants have in writing--- the stakes involved in ways of writing as genre systems mediate powerful social practices.15

# CONCLUSION

In this article, I synthesize aspects of Y. Engestrom's (1987, 1993) systems version of Vygotskian cultural-historical activity theory with aspects of Bazerman's (1994a) theory of genre systems to understand the relation between writing in school and writing in other social practices, particularly disciplines and professions and the powerful institutions they serve. I suggest that this synthesis expands Bakhtinian dialogic theory in three ways, by providing (a) a broader unit of analysis than text-as-discourse, (b) wider levels of analysis than the dyad, and (c) an expanded theory of dialectic that embraces objects and motives of collectives and their participants to explain reciprocal interactions among people through texts, which dialogism theorizes as the heteroglossic interpenetration of social languages. By tracing the relation of a disciplinary or professional genre system to an educational genre system, through the boundary of a classroom genre system, a researcher, reformer, or participant can construct a model of ways classroom writing is linked to writing in wider social practices.

This synthesis suggests how the dialogic interactions in courses and curricula interact intertextually, through the mediation of genre systems, with activity systems of both formal education and the wider social practices at the boundaries of them. The crucial elements of the analysis are (a) the coconstructions of the identity of individual and collective subjects (agents) in activity systems and the dialectical contradictions in those constructions, (b) the coconstruction of the object/motive of the activity and the dialectical contradictions in that, and (c) the tools people use to construct their individual and collective subjectivities and objects/motives, particularly the operationalized (routinized) rhetorical tools-in-use we have called genres. I analyze identity, agency, and power relations as the mutual appropriation of dynamic tools-in-use and the operationalization of those tools-in-use in genres, and knowledge as the work of an ongoing activity system abstracted and commodified into more or less (but never fully) stabilized content. Microstructural dialogic interactions are stabilized-fornow into macrostructural activity systems mediated in part by intertextual systems of genres.

I touch on three of the many possible uses of the theory: analyzing students' agency and identity as writers in relation to disciplines and professions, analyzing students' text-based or arhetorical approaches to writing, and analyzing institutional selection/assessment and student motivation for writing. I hope the theory may be useful for rethinking a range of other problems.

Ultimately, by applying Bazerman's (1994a) theory of genre systems within a framework of activity theory to interactions among education and other social practices--school and society, in John Dewey's phrase-it may be possible to bridge, in a principled way, the analytical distance between social languages (macrostructural analysis) and dialogic interactions of individuals in classrooms (microstructural analysis). Such an analysis may be useful to research and reform efforts that must account for--and involve themselves with--- the ways writing operates in and among the diverse communities that make up the past and present of students, as well as the ways writing operates in the specialization of knowledge/work into which students will expand, through myriad written rout(in)es, in the future.

# NOTES

1. Volosinov (1973) briefly discusses "behavioral genres" in an attempt to emphasize that "the sign may not be divorced from the concrete forms of social intercourse" nor communication from "the material basis" (pp. 20-21, 96-97), but the concept has not been developed thoroughly in Bakhtinian dialogic theory (see Wertsch, 1991).

2. I have adapted Cole and Engestrom's (1993; Engestrom, 1987, 1993) model of an activity system and deliberately simplified it in two major ways. First, for reasons of space, I have not included their expansion of the triangle to include consumption, exchange, and distribution to describe circulation of tools-in-use or their accompanying analysis of rules, community, and division of labor to describe historical layers, although these are implied in my analysis. Second, drawing on Leont'ev (1981), I have included motive with object to suggest that the object is also a direction of activity (in both Figures 1 and 2). This is meant to clarify the theory for my purposes here, not to suggest a departure from it.

3. This concept is similar to the concept of subject position in cultural studies, but the activity theory formulation gives equal weight to the nonlinguistic material conditions and elaborates the analysis in a systematic way, as we shall see. (For epigenetic factors, see Edelman, 1992.)

4. North American genre theory deriving from Miller (1984) is related to but distinct from both Australian genre theory in the Hallidayan tradition and the recent European movement called critical discourse analysis (CDA), which also focuses on the dynamism and variability of genres conceived historically (genre as social process) and the political and power issues involved with texts (Fairclough, 1992; Kress, 1993; Van Leeuwen, 1993). For an overview and a brief discussion of the differences, see Russell (in press). North American genre research has recently begun to use activity theory (Diaz, Freedman, Medway, & Pare, in press; Freedman & Artemeva, in press; Freedman & Smart, in press).

5. Witte (1992) persuasively argues that Vygotsky intended signs to include nonlinguistic signs and summarizes the relevant research. This interpretation is necessary to the activity theory analysis I am pursuing here (see also Wertsch, 1991).

6. Wells (1993, 1994, 1996) also identifies genre with operations in his synthesis of Hallidayan genre theory and activity theory, although he does so in a very different way.

7. The term newcomer (as contrasted with peripheral or full participant) is most closely associated with Lave and Wenger (1991). However, I am using the term not in their sense of cognitive apprenticeship but in the broader but compatible sense of anyone interacting with a new activity system. For the similarities and differences in the theories with regard to schooling and society, see Y. Engestrom (1991).

8. Research in neural science increasingly points to a very plastic capacity of human beings to categorize sensory input in relation to survival values (Edelman, 1992). In this sense, emotion and intellect are functionally inseparable, and unconscious and conscious processing interact reciprocally and dynamically to structure behavior (Damasio,

1994). This tradition of neural science-derived in large part from Vygotsky's collaborator, A. R. Luria--may provide a neurological grounding for activity theory and, I would argue further, for genre theory, in that typified responses to conditions perceived as recurring are a fluid and dynamic process of categorization on value, rather than a process of stable schema formation (Shank & Abelson, 1977) in the tradition of information processing cognitive psychology or even cultural schema formation in the tradition of cognitive anthropology (Cole & Engestrom, 1993; DuAndrade & Strauss, 1992; Gee, 1992).

9. Following Wittenstein, Swales (1990) points out that we recognize and categorize genres using "family resemblances," a loose and shifting constellation of formal features, rather than strict definitional criteria. By pointing out shared features, it is possible to make anything resemble anything---but only from the point of view of a distanced observer (from another activity system, in the terms I am developing here). Family resemblances among texts (shared formal features) are understood as belonging to a written genre by the "family" (the participants in the activity system) in complex ways that involve shared experience and complex categorization over time--a history of use (Swales, 1990, pp. 49-52).

10. This view of genre differs from the Martin/Rothery version of Hallidayan systemic functional linguistics (SFL) in that genre is seen as specific to some social practice, not an overarching discourse strategy shared by many unrelated social practices (e.g., report, recount, etc.) (Christie & Martin, 1997; Martin, 1993). But SFL and Vygotskian cultural-historical approaches are in large part complementary and compatible (Cope & Kalantzis, 1993).

11. The circulation of knowledge in popular and textbook genres also has been investigated by Fahnestock (1986) and Klamer (1990) among others in the strong program of social studies of science, which has deeply influenced the synthesis I am developing here (see Bazerman, 1982, for an overview).

12. Latour's (1987, 1993) actor-network theory is finally incompatible with a systems version activity theory because it insists that nonhuman agents be analyzed symmetrically as agents (for critiques, see Myers, 1996; Y. Engestrom, 1996). But in many respects, such as the notion of blackboxing activity into reified or commodified knowledge (Latour, 1987), his actor-network theory is compatible with activity theory. And a number of Latour's insights into the macrostructural workings of mediated networks, such as the translation of statements into new genres (Latour, 1987) and the role of inscriptions in power formation in networks (Latour, 1993) can, I believe, be appropriated to extend activity theory to consider macrostructural sociological objects in new and useful ways.

13. The systems version of activity theory often discusses these contradictions within and among activity systems in terms of zones of proximal development (ZPDs). This expands Vygotsky's (1986) original micro-level sense of the term as the difference between what a person can do alone and what a person can do with assistance to macro-level terms. A ZPD can be thought of as the "distance between the everyday actions of the individuals and the historically new form of the societal activity that can be collectively generated as a solution to the double bind potentially embedded in the everyday actions" (Y. Engestrom, 1987, p. 174; see also Valsiner & van der Vere, 1993). In this sense, it is similar to the contact zones Pratt (1987) describes. I have not taken up the complex problems of ZPD theory here, for space reasons.

14. Again, note that there are actually far more written genres than are depicted in this already overly complex diagram. And there are vastly more genres in other media:

written, mechanical, architectural, gestural, and so on, within which written genres operate. Moreover, the diagram does not attempt to depict the many genres, written and otherwise, within a particular activity system (myriad memos, data files, internal reports, contracts, policies, instructions, etc.) (see, for example, Freedman & Smart, in press; Schryer, 1993; Van Nostrand, 1997).

15. It should be clear by now that this analysis may include the activity system(s) of the researcher(s) themselves, reflexively. That is, it can allow researchers to trace their own influence on the activity systems they study (and vice versa), as when WAC researchers work with faculty to introduce writing in a course. Like certain versions of cultural studies, activity theory resists an Archimedean point of view for the analyst, instead emphasizing the involvement of the researcher in the activity networks and the potential for dialectical change in the interaction between the researchers' activity systems (and thus their subjectivities) and those of the people studied (Y. Engestrom, 1990).
