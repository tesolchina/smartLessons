# Abstract

The research paper has been identified as a genre that is commonly produced in both graduate and undergraduate courses. However, researchers have noted that this label tends to be used loosely and that texts referred to as research papers are not characterized by a fixed set of discoursal features [such as Johns A.M. (1997). Text, role and context. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press]. In addition, there appears to be no linguistic study of how the discourse structure of texts referred to as research papers may vary across courses in undergraduate or graduate programs. Using genre analysis, this study explores the nature of research papers from two disciplinary graduate courses, in order to increase our understanding of this heterogeneous genre and the dimensions along which it can vary across subdisciplines. Evaluated research papers from two courses in environmental science were analyzed along a number of dimensions: the overall organization of the papers, the claims made, the intertextual links established, and the epistemic or phenomenal focus of the paper. The results of these analyses indicate that research papers can have multiply layered communicative purposes, which may vary in different disciplinary courses, resulting in texts characterized by different discoursal features.

# 1. Introduction

In the past 20 years, there have been an increasing number of studies on academic writing conducted by researchers from the fields of composition and applied linguistics. Many of these studies have used the notion of genre, commonly defined as a set of texts sharing a particular communicative purpose and a set of discourse conventions, including overall organization, and grammatical and vocabulary choices (e.g. Christie, 1986; Swales, 1990). Many different academic genres, such as the research article and conference abstract have been studied. Studies of disciplinary (Hyland, 2000; Thompson, 2001) and cross cultural variation (Connor & Mauranen, 1999) in genres have also been conducted.

Studies have also explored the types of writing required and valued in the academy both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. For example, Casanave and Hubbard (1992) explored the types of writing tasks faced by doctoral students in a number of disciplines, while Braine (1989, 1995) analyzed writing assignment handouts from several undergraduate courses in science and technology. One genre, the research paper, is a commonly produced text in both graduate and undergraduate academic writing. For example, Bridgeman and Carlson (1984: 260) in their study of undergraduate and graduate writing noted that brief research papers are common across fields, such as civil engineering, electrical engineering, psychology, chemistry and computer science. A more recent study (Hale et al., 1996), also exploring the writing tasks of graduate and undergraduate students in American universities, determined that the library research paper (where bibliographic sources are used) was one of the most commonly observed genres in the different disciplines studied.

However, this genre has also been identified as being problematic. Larson (1982: 813) stated that the ‘‘‘research paper’ as a generic, cross-disciplinary term, has no conceptual or substantive identity,’’ because student texts given this label can refer to a wide variety of texts whose only common feature is the absence of a report of research that the student himself or herself has conducted. Swales (1990: 55–57) in his work on genre theory has noted that most genres often are characterized by having a label, such as survey article. Nonetheless, he states that some labels can be just institutional labels and may not refer to a clearly identifiable genre. Subsequently, Johns (1997) has pointed out that some genres may be loosely and casually named especially in academic contexts. She points to the example of the research paper and argues that it often may not be clear to the undergraduate student what this genre label stands for because of the great variation in the tasks required under this rubric.

In his history of composition and rhetoric, Russell (1991: 78) maintains that the research paper genre has ‘‘defined extended student writing in mass secondary and higher education.’’ However, there has been very little research on the research paper and Russell notes that in his examination of 43 composition textbooks, there was no mention of differences in this genre in different disciplines.

Thus, although the heterogeneity of texts referred to as research papers has been alluded to, there has been no systematic linguistic study of the range of texts that can be referred to by this label. Studies have not been conducted on the nature of the research paper per se in different disciplinary courses although there have indeed been numerous studies in recent years of undergraduate writing in different disciplinary courses such as Herrington (1985, 1988), Nelson (1990), Currie (1993) and

Greene (1993). These studies have explored various specific questions such as the impact of task on text, and the types of claims made in student texts. Or some studies, such as the one by Walvoord and McCarthy (1990) compare various kinds of genres, such as the argumentative essay and scientific report, produced in different disciplinary courses. Other studies, like that of Moore and Morton (1999) conducted in Australia, have analyzed the writing assignment tasks given in a large number of graduate and undergraduate courses to explore the sorts of writing experiences faced by students in different disciplines. However, these studies have not addressed the question of disciplinary variation in texts that are generally referred to by the label ‘‘research papers.’’

Research papers are not just produced in undergraduate courses but are also produced in graduate level courses as mentioned earlier. In a study on writing by doctoral students, Casanave and Hubbard (1992) rank brief and long research papers in the top five common writing tasks in the humanities/social sciences and science/technology departments. Most of the studies on graduate writing have been concerned with the writing of PhD students (and not master’s level students), who clearly are being acculturated into the disciplinary communities in question to various degrees (Belcher, 1994; Berkenkotter, Huckin, & Ackerman, 1995; Casanave, 1995; Prior, 1998). These studies, for the most part, do not focus on the writing of research papers.

In recent years there have been a few studies that have considered master’s level writing. These studies show the writing produced by master’s level students to be more complex and less understood. Casanave (2002) in a recent study discusses the case of writing produced in an MATESOL program in the US where students are required to play school-centered literacy games and to engage in the professional activities of second language instruction such as test design and evaluation. Another earlier case study of writing by professional Conservation Biologists and master’s students in a Conservation Biology course seems to indicate that student writing differs from published research articles in quite significant ways (Samraj & Swales, 2000). Ivanic and Camps (2001) have explored the different positions taken by six Mexican graduate (mainly master’s level) students in their writing in different disciplinary courses at a British university. However, as noted earlier, there has been no systematic discourse study of master’s level writing of research papers in different disciplines or sub-disciplines and our knowledge of academic writing will be enhanced by a study of research papers from different courses. In this paper, the label ‘‘research paper’’ will be used to refer to papers written by students (both graduate and undergraduate) where they discuss previous research on a particular area. As such, these papers use secondary sources and involve library research. They are similar to what Hale et al. (1996) refer to as library reseach papers in their study of writing tasks in American universities.

In this paper, I present results from a study exploring two sets of student papers referred to as research papers from two master’s level courses in environmental science. The primary goal of this analysis is to understand the discourse structure of some texts referred to as research papers and to identify variations in the discourse structure of research papers from different disciplinary courses. It must be acknowledged, though, that differences in discourse structure in these papers may not be solely due to different disciplinary values since other contextual factors such as the kind of task assigned and professor preference can also influence the types of texts produced (see Samraj, 2002 for a discussion of contextual layers surrounding student texts). Conducting a survey of content faculty on their writing assignments or even an analysis of paper assignment instructions (such as Hale et al., 1996; or Moore & Morton, 1999) will not provide the insight into textual variation that a discourse analysis can afford. The heterogeneity inherent among texts bearing this label has been acknowledged in previous studies and an understanding of some of the possible variation in this genre will be valuable for both genre theory and writing pedagogy. More importantly, this discourse study reveals that it may be useful to distinguish types of academic writing not just in terms of communicative purpose and overall organization, generally considered in genre studies, but also in terms of the roles students adopt in their papers, the types of literature used (intertextual connections made), and the focus on epistemic or phenomenal concerns (MacDonald, 1994). It is hoped that a richer picture of academic writing can emerge from increasing the number of linguistic features included within genre analysis.

# 2. Methods

The results discussed here are part of a larger study, which was a contextualized discourse analysis of student writing produced in an academic context. Three graduate courses, which were part of a Master’s in Science program in environmental science at a large public university in the United States, served as the site for this study: Wildlife Behavior, Conservation Biology and Resource Policy. Wildlife Behavior is a course grounded in natural science and is mainly concerned with the life histories and behaviors of different species, set in the context of hypothesis testing. Conservation Biology is an interdisciplinary course covering a variety of topics, relevant to the conservation of species, ranging from social issues such as overpopulation to biological issues such as calculating allele frequencies. Resource Policy is a course grounded in social science and focuses on the process of environmental policy formation and implementation. In this paper, only the research papers produced in the first two courses will be considered, as the writing assignments in Resource Policy tended to be simulations of workplace writing and were thus not included (see Samraj, 1995, 2002). Twenty-two students from Conservation Biology and eight students from Wildlife Behavior agreed to participate in this study and their papers form the corpus for this study.

This study included both qualitative and quantitative approaches to analyzing writing. Following qualitative methodology, in order to contextualize the texts studied, the researcher attended the courses from which data were collected over the course of a whole semester. Hence, she had access to classroom discussions of the writing assignments. The evaluated papers were collected for analysis, so the researcher also included the evaluation of these student texts by the disciplinary specialists in her analysis. The professors’ evaluations were used to distinguish between the successful student papers and the less successful ones. Consequently, the issue of which textual strategies contributed to successful writing in the two courses (as measured by professor evaluation) was also explored. In addition, the researcher conducted a number of interviews with the professors and a selected number of students about the papers produced as coursework requirements. (See Samraj, 1995 for a detailed description of the methodology employed.)

The texts produced in the two courses were analyzed along a number of dimensions. First, the overall organization of the papers was studied because many studies on academic writing have focused on this aspect of genre structure. Second, the roles that the students assumed in their papers, perhaps most clearly seen in the types of claims they made, were compared. Earlier research, such as that by Herrington (1985), has indicated that student writers construct different roles in their academic writing by making different kinds of claims. Third, the types of intertextual links established in these texts were explored, including the historical depth of the references and the types of sources referred to. Intertextual links are another important discoursal dimension of academic writing shown to vary across disciplines (Hyland, 1999; Thompson, 2001). Finally, using a model developed by MacDonald (1994), the types of ‘‘worlds’’ foregrounded in the papers were considered in terms of sentence subject choices. This analysis was performed because earlier studies of grammatical features, such as the sentence subject, have revealed that different disciplinary values can result in different grammatical choices in academic writing. Though all 30 papers were analyzed for the first four dimensions, only six papers from each course, selected to represent the range of grades awarded, were analyzed for the final dimension (because each sentence subject was coded).

# 3. Results and discussion

Although the papers were referred to as research papers in both courses, the task specification was slightly different in each course. The writing assignment in Conservation Biology was described as ‘‘a research paper that could be published elsewhere’’ (Lecture Notes 14, September 1992) and also as a ‘‘scholarly paper’’ (Lecture Notes 14, October 1992). A list of possible topics was given to the students and they were instructed that the paper had to be ‘‘at least $50 \%$ biology and could not be all on policy.’’ In Wildlife Behavior, the students were instructed to ‘‘integrate the literature on (their) chosen topic, discuss competing hypotheses, and perhaps suggest directions for future research’’ (Assignment Handout, Fall 1992).

# 3.1. Overall organization

As mentioned earlier, a substantial amount of research on academic writing has focused on the overall organization of both oral and written texts (Nwogu, 1997; Shalom, 1993, etc.). The organization of research articles, for example, has been extensively studied with particular focus on the introduction within this genre (Swales, 1990; Swales & Najjar, 1987, etc.). The scientific research article has been shown to generally have the Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion (IMRD) structure. Because the student papers analyzed in this study do not report original results, the IMRD structure that characterizes scientific research articles is largely absent. Furthermore the organizational patterns found in the two sets of research papers are different. Most of the Conservation Biology papers possess a problem– solution organization (Hoey, 1983). In brief, the problem most usually deals with the state of a particular species in the present world, but it could also concern problems associated with conservation strategies already in place. Most of these papers tend not to discuss positive aspects of the state of the species or habitat being discussed. The solution includes recommendations for management strategies or research that would ultimately help in the conservation of a species, though the latter is not as common as the former. For example, a paper discussed the grizzly bear’s habitat fragmentation and ended with recommendations such as creating connections between Yellowstone and other grizzly populations to prevent habitat fragmentation.

The Conservation Biology papers invariably begin with a statement of the problem with the species concerned. This typically includes information on how the species has decreased in number and may even include a chronology of events to convey the progression in destruction, as in the excerpt below from the paper on the grizzly bear’s habitat fragmentation:

(1) Historically, the grizzly bear’s range included the entire western half of the United States (Fig. 1), with a total estimated population of 100,000 individuals (IGBC 1985). Currently, the population is estimated at approximately 700 individuals (Mattson 1992: pers. comm.) Several events have clearly influenced the bears’ decline. . . A pattern of habitat destruction, primarily through ranching and developing of the human landscape, has continued throughout the grizzlys’ range. By 1975, the grizzly population had been reduced to less than 1000 individuals. The drastic population decline resulted in the listing of the species as ‘‘threatened’’ pursuant to the Endangered Species Act in 1975 (USFWS 1982).

Today, the grizzly is limited to six isolated populations in the lower 48 states (Figures 2 and 3), with an estimated total population of 700 individuals . .

The narrative of events appears as a justification for the topic discussed and leads to a greater in-depth analysis of the problems that threaten the survival of the species under consideration.

Some of the texts focus more on the conservation solution than the initial problem itself. In this case, a cyclical pattern of organization is created because the proposed solution to the problem of species diminution is in turn presented as a problem. One paper that has this cyclical pattern (see Fig. 1) addresses the issue of primate reintroductions, which is part of the solution to the problem of decline in the number of certain primates in the wild. This paper evaluates specific cases of release programs (conservation solutions) in order to present recommendations with regard to these training and release programs.

Fig. 1. One type of a problem–solution paper.

A key rhetorical element in the Conservation Biology paper is the solution provided in the conclusion. This is mainly presented in terms of recommended actions. These recommendations stem from the problems associated with the preservation of a species or the problems of already existing solutions to conservation. These recommendations are management actions and may be accompanied by statements of what might happen if the recommendations are not implemented as in the last sentence of the following excerpt:

(2) Hatchery practices can also be improved. A more stock-specific approach should be used to better maintain the genetic integrity of wild stocks. This process could involve identifying the individual stocks most at risk and selectively using artificial production to boost their numbers, rather than blindly attempting to increase the numbers of the entire Pacific Salmon population. . . Without immediate, substantive action to preserve wild Pacific Salmon in the Columbia River Basin, this symbol of the Pacific Northwest will continue its run towards extinction.

Though recommendations for further research are present occasionally, they rarely appear by themselves in the Conservation Biology papers. Interestingly, in response to a student’s recommendation for further research on the biology of endangered macaws, the professor responds, ‘‘if we wait, they all may be extinct,’’ expressing the view that Conservation Biology is a crisis discipline which values immediate action.

The Wildlife Behavior research papers do not have an identifiable problem–solution structure. Instead they are organized either chronologically or by themes. Since the writing task was for the students to review the literature on a certain issue, it is not surprising that some students chose to organize the information in a chronological fashion. However, this is not the most common organizing principle used. Five out of the eight papers do not have a chronological organization and are ordered in terms of themes. In some cases, these themes are organized from general to specific issues. For example, in a paper on chimpanzee maternal care, the student writer provides a general review of chimpanzee behavior in the wild and moves on to look at paternal care, followed by a discussion of maternal care, care by males and young males’ behavior. Interestingly, out of the eight papers that formed the Wildlife Behavior corpus, it does not seem as though the successful and less successful papers are characterized by a particular organizational structure.

The introductions in the Wildlife Behavior papers are unlike those in the Conservation Biology papers since only three out of the eight papers include a discussion of a problem. These are research problems or research questions and are not problems concerning the state of the environment. In the Wildlife Behavior papers, in addition to the general overview of the topic to be discussed, the writers may also provide some background information on the species. For example, in a paper discussing theories on alloparenting, the writer provides a description of elephants’ social organization. On a few occasions background information is even presented in terms of definitions for key concepts in the introduction:

(3) Aestivation—This thermoregulatory strategy is similar to hibernation in the observed behavior of the animal and physiological changes that occur. Aestivation is distinguished from hibernation in the temperature of dormancy. Animals that aestivate are dormant at higher temperatures than hibernation and may not be able to tolerate extremely low temperatures (Hudson, 1978).

The conclusions in the Wildlife Behavior papers resemble those from the Conservation Biology papers to a certain extent. They both also contain recommendations; however, these recommendations are for further research and are not management suggestions. Through the review of the literature, the writers identify gaps in the research, which they consequently present as potential areas for future research. An excerpt of a conclusion containing research recommendations is given below:

(4) The actual costs for male and female offspring must be explored (Frank 1990). While skewed sex ratios, maternal behavior, and sex differences in growth rates have led researchers to infer that males are more costly to rear than females (McClure, 1981; Wright et al., 1988; Clark et al., 1990; Clark et al., 1991; Huck et al., 1990; Krackow and Hoeck, 1989), the degree of difference in the cost of males to females for all species studied remains unexplored, untested, and unknown.

The presence of research recommendations in the conclusion of the Wildlife Behavior papers is not surprising because the paper instructions stated that the papers could ‘‘perhaps suggest directions for future research.’’

# 3.2. Roles of student writers

Research papers from different courses can also be different in the roles that the student writers create. These roles are perhaps most clearly seen in the claims that the students make in their papers. In their research papers, students do not just report the research conducted by others, for they make certain claims, such as research recommendations and evaluations of theories, which can be taken to be their contribution to the disciplinary conversation. Since previous studies of academic discourse (Herrington, 1985) have shown that the claims students make in their texts may vary in different disciplinary contexts, it might be predicted that the claims students make in these two environmental science courses may also vary somewhat, resulting in the construction of two slightly different author roles in the two sets of texts. Although a detailed quantitative study of student claims in the two sets of papers was undertaken in the original study (Samraj, 1995), only a general discussion of the types of claims in the two sets of papers will be presented here.

The author’s persona in the Conservation Biology papers is perhaps most clearly seen in the recommendations made, especially those that concern management actions. Sometimes the management recommendations are intertwined with research recommendations as in the following excerpt where the author shows how the conservation action, translocation, can be linked to research findings in population genetics:

(5) The Baltic Sea and Lappland populations are regarded as separate based on observations of banded birds (Helander, 1990a). Researchers could use electrophoretic studies to further test this assumption and to determine the extent of gene flow. If the low number of birds the last hundred of years has resulted in higher inbreeding than normal, the Swedish sea eagles may face risk of inbreeding depressions. In this case, active translocation of birds or eggs may be necessary.

By presenting management recommendations, the students construct the role of conservation biologist for themselves. In fact, an editor of the journal Conservation Biology states in an editorial that conservation biologists ‘‘get the job done only by translating scientific findings into policy and management prescriptions’’ (Noss, 1993: 216) and this is what the student writers attempt to do.

In order to reach these recommendations, students often evaluate conservation programs or the state of a certain species. Evaluations are another type of claims that are generally found in the Conservation Biology research papers. In a claim analyzed as an evaluation, the writer can evaluate the state of a species or even an agency involved in a political issue. These evaluations tend to be negative more often than positive, justifying the ensuing recommendations, as in the following excerpt from a paper on fisheries management in Sri Lanka, where the student evaluates the practices within commercial fisheries and their negative ecological impact:

(6) However, in commercial fisheries, exploitation of all fish species at their respective sustainable levels remains a problem. In commercial fisheries, sustainable exploitation is aimed mainly at more economically valuable species (Panayotou 1982). This results in over-exploitation of some species which are not commercially important but may have a high ecological significance. Therefore, it is necessary to take steps to prevent over-exploitation not only of commercially important species but also of ecologically significant species.

In this excerpt, the student’s negative evaluation of the practices within fisheries, that is, that exploitation of all fish species remains a problem, leads to his recommendation regarding ecologically significant species in the last sentence. From the successful papers (according to the professor’s evaluation) from Conservation Biology, we see that evaluations play an important role and ultimately lead to recommendations concerning both research and conservation. Therefore, these student writers appear to create the role of a conservation biologist in their research papers, mainly through these evaluations and recommendations.

The persona that students create in their research papers in Wildlife Behavior is somewhat different. Here students do not generally adopt the role of ‘‘problemsolver.’’ Instead, the student’s role is created through the evaluations of theories, implications of findings and hypotheses, and recommendations for future research they provide. A salient feature of the Wildlife Behavior papers is the presence of the implications of research findings that the students point out, as shown in example 7:

(7) Further, it must be noted that any sex biased mortality occurring after the termination of parental investment will not alter the selective pressure on sex ratios produced by parents. The salient factor in this analysis is that the amount of gain, in terms of future representation of genetic material, will not be affected by shifts in the sex ratio after termination of parental investment. If one half of all males die after this period, the surviving males will still have the same total reproductive values as the remaining females. Thus, the investment by parents in more sons would not be selected for.

The last two sentences in this excerpt present implications of the theoretical point that the amount of gain in genetic material is not affected by shifts in sex ratio after parental investment has ended. An interesting feature of the Wildlife Behavior research papers is the if-clauses that form many of the implications made. In these claims, the students appear to be testing the limits of the theories and hypotheses being discussed. For instance, in the above excerpt the student deduces what the situation will be ‘‘if one half of all the males die.’’

As is the case in the Conservation Biology papers, another type of claim that is frequent in the student papers is evaluations, particularly negative ones. However, in the Wildlife Behavior papers, these negative evaluations lead to research recommendations and not to conservation recommendations.

(8) Given the evidence presented in this paper, I feel that the social pathology hypothesis does not effectively account for infant killing in langur populations. If infanticide is indeed an aberrant behavior exhibited in langurs as a result of human disturbance, one would expect the trait to be equally expressed in females, since they too would be subject to human disturbances. However, after conducting a literature search, I was unable to find even one case of female infanticide among langur populations. I believe that studies documenting infanticide by females at rates similar to that of males would be needed in order to afford the social pathology hypothesis serious consideration.

In the above excerpt, the negative evaluations that the social pathology hypothesis does not sufficiently account for infant killing in langur populations and that there is no documentation of female infanticide among langur populations leads to a statement about a gap in current research and recommendation for relevant research. Interestingly, this sequence of negative evaluation/gap indication and research recommendation, to a degree, parallels the rhetorical structure found in research article introductions, where an indication of a gap is often followed by a statement of the goals of the current research being reported (Swales, 1990). In fact, in response to the negative evaluation and ensuing research recommendation provided by one writer in her paper, the instructor suggests that the student pursue that area of research in future doctoral work. We can conclude from this that by producing these claims, some of the student writers succeed in constructing the role of future researcher in addition to that of a student merely showing his/her understanding of the concepts in wildlife behavior by pointing out the implications of theories.

# 3.3. Intertextual links

The research papers from the two courses also differ in the sorts of intertextual links established. Previous studies have indicated that the use of sources can vary from discipline to discipline (Nightingale, 1988: 76). References to literature in the field is an important constituent of a text’s structure and can thus vary across disciplines (Hyland, 1999).

One of the Conservation Biology instructor’s goals for this course was to move the students from being multi-disciplinary to being interdisciplinary, an orientation reflected in part in the intertextual links established in the research papers. One paper that was said to have the right mix of biology and policy for the Conservation Biology course has numerous types of references. This successful paper on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge refers to texts belonging to various genres such as newspaper articles, journals such as the Audobon, biology textbooks, and government documents issued by the Department of Interior, US Fish and Wildlife Service. The papers that were more successful in Conservation Biology (that is, those which were the top half in terms of grades assigned) tend to include references to policy documents and material that deal with human concerns, such as journal articles on economics and social psychology. And papers that were said to have good topics for the course by the instructor also have a lower percentage of citations to ecological and biological material than citations to material on policy and other social issues. In contrast, the less successful research papers tend to limit references to ecological and conservation articles.

The single disciplinary nature of Wildlife Behavior research papers is reflected in the fact that references are restricted to biological and ecological studies of wildlife and to scientific texts and experiments. There are generally no references to works on policy or conservation matters. Unlike the Conservation Biology research papers, the Wildlife Behavior ones establish intertextual links with sources that have greater historical depth. In addition, the references in the Wildlife Behavior papers span a longer period in time, as they stretch from the middle of the 19th century to the early 1990s. Interestingly, it is the more successful papers from this course that include references to the original works of Darwin. These successful papers have a similar historical depth to published papers in evolutionary biology, which, according to a study conducted by Miller and Hollaran (1993), include at least one reference to Darwin’s work. Since Conservation Biology is an emerging discipline, it is not surprising that there is much less historical depth in the research papers from this course, where most of the references are from the 1970s and 1980s.

# 3.4. Epistemic and phenomenal foci

The final analysis concerns patterns in sentence subject choice and the resulting ‘‘worlds’’ created in the texts using a model of analysis proposed by MacDonald (1994). In this analysis, sentence subjects are categorized into two broad groups, epistemic and phenomenal, in order to determine what the writers choose to foreground in their texts, whether the physical phenomena being studied or the ‘‘methods, conceptual tools, and previous research that the researcher brings to bear’’ on the material being studied (MacDonald, 1994: 157). MacDonald constructed this model in order to capture differences in disciplinary knowledge-making in academic writing. The research papers from the two courses could be predicted to vary in the aspects of the environmental world that they choose to focus on and recreate. This analysis of sentence subjects is similar to earlier analyses of patterns in lexicogrammatical choices, which have been employed to reveal the worlds constructed and ideologies exhibited in various sorts of texts such as newspaper articles (Kress & Hodge, 1979; Trew, 1979) and academic texts (Wignell, Martin, & Eggins, 1993). MacDonald’s analysis is also similar to recent register analyses where patterns of grammatical choices are related to contextual variables such as the disciplinary affiliations of texts (Biber, 1988; Biber, Conrad, & Reppen, 1999).

Analyzing sentence subject choice alone may seem to be a limited means of discerning the worlds constructed in texts. However, functional linguists, typologists and cognitive grammarians have maintained the grammatical, semantic and cognitive salience of the sentence subject in the world’s languages. For example, Langacker (1991: 305) states that sentence subjects play a pivotal role in grammatical structures in the world’s languages. Drawing on figure/ground organization, Langacker argues that the subject stands out from the rest of the clause as the focus of interest. In light of the studies on the semantic, pragmatic and cognitive properties of the grammatical subject, MacDonald’s model of subject analysis appears to be justified. Moreover, her framework has produced interesting findings about published research articles from psychology, history and literature (MacDonald, 1994). Another study by Gosden (1993), also focusing on the grammatical subject in academic discourse but using a slightly different framework, has explored the changing discourse roles of subjects from the introduction to the concluding section of the research article.

As mentioned earlier, for this analysis of sentence subjects, six papers from each course, selected to represent the range of grades given for the assignment, were analyzed. The subject of the first main clause in each sentence was categorized as phenomenal or epistemic. (Sentences with compound clauses only constituted a small proportion of sentences in this corpus and therefore were not counted in the study.) Following MacDonald, phenomenal subjects are those which refer to the materials being analyzed and include subjects that refer to particular entities, such as ‘‘the Swedish Association of the Conservation of Nature,’’ to groups, such as ‘‘conservation groups’’ and to attributes of particular or group entities, such as ‘‘the competition for female resources.’’ Epistemic subjects also can be subcategorized and include those that refer to the research, such as ‘‘data from a colony of captive chimpanzees’’ and the researcher, such as ‘‘Pratt et al. (1987).’’ The percentages of subjects in each category were calculated for each paper and mean percentages of subject types for each of the two sets of papers were also calculated.

MacDonald’s model was modified to a certain extent though the original goals of the model were not altered. In fact, the modifications only affect the subcategories within the two main categories. Though the sentence subjects from the two sets of papers were subcategorized for all the subcategories of Phenomenal and Epistemic subjects (see Samraj, 1995, 2000, for detailed results), only the main results will be discussed here.

As seen in Table 1, a key finding of this analysis is that the Wildlife Behavior research papers have a much higher percentage of epistemic subjects than the Conservation Biology papers. That is, the research papers focus much more on the epistemic world of knowledge construction than the Conservation Biology research papers. The focus in these texts is not just the wildlife behavior, such as ‘‘alloparenting’’ or ‘‘chimpanzee maternal care’’ discussed but also the research methods and conceptual tools used to study this behavior. As such, references to researchers and previous studies frequently occur as subjects of sentences. In fact, it is the more successful papers in Wildlife Behavior which have a greater frequency of epistemic subjects, as seen in the excerpt below:

(9) Charnov (1979) proposed that equal allocation may not always govern sex ratios. Working with simultaneous hermaphrodites, Chanov showed that the expected genetic returns of an offspring may not be linearly related to the amount of parental investment received, and that this non-linearity can affect the expected sex ratio.

Epistemic subjects are not completely absent in the Conservation Biology research papers but they are not as frequent as in the Wildlife Behavior papers. Interestingly enough, the presence of epistemic subjects also cannot be correlated to success in writing in the Conservation Biology course, unlike writing in Wildlife Behavior. There is a certain amount of variation in the types of sentence subjects in these research papers, indicating that it is not as important to create an epistemic world in this course. Students can choose to focus on the material being studied such as the ‘‘wolf recovery’’ or they can choose to focus on the epistemic world, namely, the researchers and studies that constitute this world, without necessarily affecting their papers’ success in this course, as seen in the two excerpts below, which are both from successful papers:

(10) Wolf recovery will not come easily however. Wolves moving into the U.S. face obstacles such as fragmented habitats, lack of corridors, and other barriers that affect their ability to disperse.   
(11) Several researchers have observed that some species with TSD lay clutches of eggs which prove to be nearly or completely unisexual (Mrosovsky and Provancha 1991: Vogt 1984).

# 4. Conclusions

This study of two sets of research papers from courses with slightly different disciplinary proclivities has revealed the textual variation possible across written discourses that are given the same label. Through the use of a multi-modal analytical framework, I was able to capture variation that may not have been evident in a more traditional analysis focused around one or two textual dimensions. The study has shown that it is useful in genre analysis to consider a number of discoursal dimensions, in addition to overall organization. Considering both macro and micro dimensions such as overall organization, intertextual links, sentence subject choice, and the roles students create for themselves through their claims has revealed some (but certainly not all) of the ways research papers may vary across different disciplinary courses.

In Conservation Biology, students generally produce a Problem–Solution paper where conservation recommendations are made in response to an environmental problem explicated. The students construct a persona of problem-solver through these recommendations given. Information from different sources belonging to multiple genres and fields is drawn on for support. The focus in the texts is not often research in the field of Conservation Biology but rather the environmental phenomenon being discussed. In contrast, in Wildlife Behavior the papers provide a chronological or theme-by-theme account of research on a particular animal behavior, which often leads to an identification of a gap in the research field. The students evaluate the research being reported and point out the implications of some of the research results and hypotheses discussed. When recommendations are provided, they focus on the research field. Most of the sources drawn on are scientific studies and, not surprisingly, the focus of the papers as seen through the choice of sentence subjects is the epistemic world of research.

This study also raises questions for genre theory. Although these two sets of texts vary in interesting ways, their communicative purpose, at a general level, namely, to report research, appears similar. Does this make these two sets of texts members of the same genre? There is no simple answer to this question. As Askehave and Swales (2001) have argued, communicative purpose is often a criterion for identifying a genre but it is not always clear what the communicative purpose of a set of texts is. As they state, the communicative purpose for a set of texts can be too general to be useful for genre categorization. In addition, Askehave and Swales have argued that texts can also have ‘‘complexly layered’’ communicative purposes, only a few of which are officially acknowledged or recognized. Beyond the more obvious general communicative purpose of the texts analyzed, there can be other more specific ones that are elusive to the writing researcher. Analysis of these two sets of research papers has also pointed to the presence of layers of communicative purposes. In Conservation Biology, other than synthesizing research on a particular environmental issue, a communicative purpose appears to be identifying an environmental problem and providing a solution, which results in the Problem–Solution paper. In Wildlife Behavior, on the other hand, a communicative purpose is to evaluate the research already conducted in an area and to suggest areas for future research.

This study has provided discoursal evidence for earlier claims that what faculty call research papers do not constitute a clearly defined genre (e.g. Johns, 1997). Instead, it can be argued that they form a heterogeneous genre with a number of sub-genres. These various sub-genres that are produced in the context of different disciplinary courses may be said to have their own more narrow communicative purposes, such as identifying a research gap in the field, which is manifested textually not just in the macro-organization of the text (in terms of a research recommendation in the conclusion) but also in sentence-level patterns such as the types of subjects.

As Swales (1990) has suggested, prototype theory can also be used to discuss texts that belong to the same genre. Some texts may be thought to be more prototypical exemplars of a genre than others. Applying the notion of prototype to the variation found in research papers produced by students, as shown by this study, would mean that we would be able to identify a certain subset of texts as being more prototypical members of this genre than others. Such a categorization could conceivably only result from rather more analysis of texts that belong to this genre and a study of the judgments of academic specialists on the prototypicality of particular texts as instances of the research paper genre.

This study has highlighted the differences across research papers and identified some of the dimensions along which research papers could vary across disciplines or sub-disciplines. As intimated earlier, these differences in discourse structure may not be entirely due to differences in disciplinary values in the two courses. The kinds of tasks assigned in the different courses undoubtedly would have had some impact on the student-produced papers. However, what is noteworthy is that somewhat different tasks were assigned under the research paper label, resulting in different kinds of texts. Some pedagogical implications arise from these findings. Students could be made aware of disciplinary variations in discourse values manifested in research papers in academic writing courses. For instance, students could be made aware that in a particular field research papers may have a much more epistemic focus than those from some other field. Additionally, the intertextual links established may have greater historical depth in research papers in one course than those in another. Students need not be instructed on the particular values of their discipline but could be made aware of the discourse dimensions that may vary in research papers from different content courses.
