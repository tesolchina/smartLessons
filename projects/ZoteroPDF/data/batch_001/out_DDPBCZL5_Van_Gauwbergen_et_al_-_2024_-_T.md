Intralingual live subtitling   
EMI

One of the challenges in higher education is providing educational access to an increasingly multilingual and multicultural student population. Universities are therefore considering using English as language of instruction (EMI), but students’ limited proficiency in English can be a drawback. Live subtitling might help to overcome this language barrier. The aim of this article is to report on (1) whether these subtitles influence their performance and (2) how university students in Flanders perceive EMI lectures with intralingual live subtitles. This has been investigated during five 2-h Marketing lectures taught in English to students of Economics who have Dutch as mother tongue $2 7 \%$ bilingual). The live subtitling was produced in each lecture in real time through respeaking during two lecture fragments of approximately $2 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . Quantitative and qualitative data have been collected using (1) online language tests, consisting of a certified listening test and vocabulary test to determine the students’ English proficiency; (2) an online demographics questionnaire (e.g. mother tongue and self-reported proficiency in English); (3) tests after each lecture about the content and perception of the lecture. The findings show that, on average, students performed noticeably better in a comprehension test when given intralingual live subtitles.

# 1. Introduction

One of the main challenges that higher education institutions are faced with today is providing educational access to an increasingly multilingual and multicultural student population in a world where there is an increasing presence of English (Codo, ´ 2022). Consequently, numerous universities are resorting to the use of English as medium of instruction (EMI) (Sah, 2022). EMI can be defined as the “use of the English language to teach academic subjects (other than English itself) in countries or jurisdictions where the first language of the majority of the population is not English” (Macaro et al., 2018, p. 37). EMI is often compared to other types of content teaching in an L2, such as CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning).1 However, one of the main differences is that EMI teachers focus on their academic subject, while CLIL teachers are committed to the learning of both content and English.

A series of studies have indicated that EMI shows a strong growth in Higher Education (HE) (Marcjanik, 2023; Shao & Rose, 2022). However, Flanders seems to be rather reluctant to introduce EMI, in stark contrast to other regions in the world (Rose et al., 2020; Sah & Karki, 2020): across higher educational levels, only $7 . 5 \%$ of all programmes are fully taught in English, just above the European average $( 6 \% )$ . This is due to current legal restrictions, but the situation might change in the future with a possible increase of the percentage of allowed EMI in Flemish Bachelor programmes to $5 0 \%$ of all programmes (Furtado Guimaraes ˜ & Martins Kremer, 2020).

EMI programmes have several aims or ’drivers’, 2 such as to gain access to cutting-edge knowledge and increase global competitiveness, to raise the international profile of the university, to attract foreign students to increase income, to enhance student and lecturer mobility, to enhance employability, and to improve English proficiency (Galloway et al., 2017), although programme objectives in terms of L2 proficiency in EMI are "rarely stated" (Richards & Pun, 2022, p. 40). As Macaro states (2018, p. 38), language learning "may take place incidentally as a result of EMI", but the teacher will generally assume that the students’ proficiency in English will be developed elsewhere.

Pun et al. (2024) also highlight the abolition of language obstacles to attract foreign students who would not enroll in a programme taught in the domestic language. In other words, one of the aims of EMI programmes is to remove linguistic barriers or obstacles, primarily for foreign students. However, the removal of linguistic barriers for foreign students by introducing EMI might mean that new linguistic barriers are created for home students (Machin et al., 2023; Milligan, 2020; Sah & Li, 2020; Sung, 2020; Tsou & Baker, 2021; Wijesekera & Hamid, 2022). Besides, it might be a barrier for some of the foreign students as well since most of them are also L2 speakers of English. In other words, EMI may pose a language barrier for non-English students or students not proficient in English (Galloway et al., 2020; Kuteeva, 2020).

Nachtrab and Mossner ¨ (2017) already suggested subtitling lectures, either in the same language or in a different language (respectively intralingual and interlingual subtitling). This might be a resolution for linguistic barriers. In fact, intralingual live subtitling of lectures, that is in real time, is not new; it is an accessibility service already offered in Germany and Switzerland for students with disabilities (Nachtrab & Mossner, ¨ 2017). Traditional subtitles (i.e. prepared, not live) have been shown to impact comprehension and learning positively, as we will show in section 3.3. However, the question remains open as far as live subtitles are concerned. Consequently, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of intralingual live subtitles in EMI lectures on Flemish students’ (with different levels of English proficiency) performance (i.e. comprehension and memory) and perception, taking their level of English proficiency into account. Our main research questions are.

• RQ1: Do students perform better, i.e. comprehend, and remember the content better, when live intralingual subtitles are provided? • RQ2: Does performance vary with the students’ level of proficiency in English, as objectively measured by the Education First Standardized English Test and the 3000, 4000 and 5000 level of the updated Vocabulary Levels Test? • RQ3: How do students perceive the presence and quality of subtitles (e.g. disruptive, helpful, distracting, qualitative, demanding, etc.) and the impact of subtitles on their performance?

To answer these research questions, we examined five 2-h on campus (i.e. not online) EMI Marketing lectures attended by students of Economics - with Dutch as mother tongue - at the University of Antwerp in the academic year 2021–2022. In each lecture, live subtitles were offered for half of the lecture. They were projected at the bottom of the PowerPoint presentation used by the lecturer. As we will show in section 4, quantitative and qualitative data were collected to measure performance (comprehension and memory), English language proficiency and perception of the live subtitled parts of each lecture.

In the next section, we will focus on research on linguistic barriers in EMI and on the benefits of (live) subtitling in general and in education in particular.

# 2. Challenges of EMI

The emergence of EMI as a field of study is very recent. Bolton et al. (2024) identified 59 book-length studies of EMI of which $7 5 \%$ were published in the last 5 years. Some studies focus on one country, others on Europe or other parts of the world. However, there are very few studies focusing on Flanders. In an overview of studies on EMI students’ beliefs, Richards and Pun (2022) list a number of European countries, such as Spain, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Denmark, but Flanders (or Belgium, Flanders being one of the three regions of the Belgian state) is not covered. This is also true in Bolton et al.’s Routledge Handbook of EMI in Higher Education (2024). Although a whole section of the book is dedicated to European countries, again, Flanders (or Belgium) is absent. We only found three studies on Flanders, i.e. Furtado Guimaraes˜ and Martins Kremer (2020) and van Splunder (2016, 2021). Consequently, when discussing the challenges of EMI in relation to the context of this study (Flanders), we will concentrate on its direct neighbors (The Netherlands, where Dutch is also the official language; Germany; and France), and also on Switzerland. The reason to include the Swiss context is that the country shares some common features with Belgium: Switzerland has four official languages, Belgium three, i.e. Dutch, French and German. Besides, all five countries belong to what is called the ‘Expanding Circle EMI’ in the World Englishes Model (WE) by Bolton et al. (p. 9–10, 2024): the model highlights the importance of the local context behind the dynamics of EMI implementation, and in countries of the Expanding Circle, the popularity and spread of EMI is more recent and mainly motivated by globalization and internationalization. Finally, we will also include studies from European regions and countries with a similar EF English Proficiency Index (i.e. very high), such as Scandinavia, Austria, Portugal, Croatia and Greece, with the latter three respectively occupying the 7th, 11th and 12th place in the EF Global Ranking of countries and regions by English skills.3

# 2.1. Linguistic barriers in EMI

As stated before, removing linguistic barriers for foreign students through EMI might create new linguistic barriers for home students. In other words, it is important to make sure that EMI has no significant detrimental effect on content learning because of linguistic barriers. According to Richards and Pun (2022), linguistic challenges are to a great extent relative and depend on the English proficiency of the students (and teachers). Linguistic proficiency in English relates to different skills, i.e. listening and reading comprehension, writing, speaking and interacting. On the one hand, we will concentrate on listening comprehension, since live subtitles in our study are meant to facilitate that particular skill. On the other hand, we will report on studies that focus on content learning in EMI, in the first place in the countries under scrutiny, and when relevant, beyond.

As far as listening skills are concerned, following a lecture is one of the main challenges for EMI students. In particular, vocabulary and technical terms pose special difficulties. In addition, the teacher’s proficiency and strong accent for example can hinder comprehension. However, topic prior knowledge can facilitate comprehension.

Students in Flanders should have a sufficient proficiency in English to understand a lecture: according to the EF English Proficiency Index,4 Flemish students have a very high proficiency. However, specialized discipline-related terminology will remain a challenge. There is to our knowledge no study on the topic for Flanders, but insights from neighboring countries can be informative.

While many students in Europe recognize the added benefits of learning English through EMI, they often refer to a lack of proficiency among themselves, their fellow students, and their lecturers, or they have trouble understanding them due to their non-native accents (Hultgren, 2024). This is the case in Sweden (Bolton & Kuteeva, 2012), Norway (Hellekjaer, 2017), Denmark (Jensen et al., 2013) and Germany (Stuers, 2019). Longitudinal studies from Austria and the Netherlands, however, have found that any initial challenges concerning proficiency are usually levelled out over time (Klaassen, 2001; Smit, 2010). In Germany, they often face challenges for which they are insufficiently prepared (Schafer, ¨ 2016) as such challenges go far beyond receptive skills in terms of listening and reading (Gnutzmann et al., 2015). In other words, students are often less experienced with English as an academic language. In France, Macaro (2018) found evidence that lecturers not only see student proficiency as inadequate but even as a possible barrier to being able to access an EMI programme. In Switzerland, language barriers are reported to be limited (Schaller-Swaner & Kirkpatrick, 2024), which also confirms the high ranking of the country in the previously mentioned EF Global Ranking of countries and regions by English skills. As for the other European countries mentioned with very high proficiency, such as Croatia, the introduction of EMI is, surprisingly, largely facing skepticism. As pointed out by Drljaˇca Margi´c and Zeˇ ˇzeli´c (2015), students are largely unwilling to undertake EMI, partly because they doubt the ability of teachers and students to transfer and acquire knowledge in English. Moreover, lack of vocabulary often causes teachers to repeat or paraphrase less than in their native language, negatively impacting students’ learning, as pointed out by Macaro (2018).

In sum, it is therefore worrisome that EMI is being introduced more and more frequently, while the evidence is currently lacking to say with certainty that it does not have a negative impact on comprehension of the lectures.

# 2.2. Learning outcomes in EMI

A different impact of EMI on the learning outcomes is observed in several countries under scrutiny. In Switzerland, multilingual practices in response to perceived needs are naturally adopted, so the use of other languages does not have to be restricted here, since there is no negative effect on learning outcomes (Schaller-Swaner & Kirkpatrick, 2024). This is in stark contrast with the situation in The Netherlands (Gabri¨els & Wilkinson, 2024), Germany (Bohlinger & Anh Dang, 2024) and France (Le Li\`evre, 2021).

Regarding our first neighboring country, in their overview of EMI in the Netherlands, Gabri¨els and Wilkinson (2024) first refer to the negative effects found in the study of Vinke (1995), who showed a detrimental effect for Dutch students in learning content in English compared to Dutch. Similar adverse effects were reported by Jochems (1991) and Jochems et al. (1996). In their comparative study of the implications of learning through EMI on study achievement, de Vos et al. (2020) observed a significant negative effect for Dutch students learning through English compared with Dutch students studying an identical programme through their first language. The finding of an adverse effect, even if small, of EMI on the learning of Dutch students compared to learning in the first language is also in line with Breetvelt’s (2018) conclusion. In this context, Macaro (2024) asks himself how long is needed for EMI students to catch up with L1 students, and how long it is acceptable for that catching up process to take place, in order to justify the use of EMI, since initial challenges regarding learning outcomes are also only levelled out over time (Hultgren, 2024). Another Dutch study by van den Doel et al. (2021) examined the effects of EMI on students’ learning performance, concluding that there is no unequivocal answer. In some cases, there is a negative effect and in others no effect (van den Doel et al., 2021, p. 27). According to the researchers, various factors mitigate or cancel out negative effects, such as language support, which would also be useful in Germany, where more significant difficulties with comprehension of EMI content are faced (Gopferich ¨ et al., 2019). As for the situation in other European countries with high proficiency levels in English, such as, again, Croatia, they fear the effect of EMI that makes their studies too time-consuming and adversely affects their grades. Also in this case, the suggestion for language support made by van den Doel et al. (2021) would be useful. To our knowledge, there is no similar research for the other countries under scrutiny. However, there is a lot of research on other countries with lower English proficiency, such as the studies by Ali (2021), Chung and Lo (2023), Gardiner (2024), Hadingham (2023), Wang and Yu (2023) and Zhou et al. (2023).

Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above show that students’ English language proficiency plays an important role in EMI lectures, impacting learning outcomes, hence the argument for linguistic (and content) support, e.g. by providing live subtitles. As mentioned in RQ2, we are also interested in the students’ English proficiency (both self-reported and objectively measured). Learning outcomes (comprehension), on the other hand, are linked to RQ1.

# 3. Benefits of subtitles in an educational context

# 3.1. Theoretical framework for subtitling in an educational context: the multimedia learning theory

Much of the research into the beneficial effects of subtitles on learning is based on Mayer’s (2014, 2021) cognitive theory of multimedia learning (i.e. building mental representations from words and pictures). This theory has three underlying assumptions, derived from cognitive science: (1) the dual channel assumption, i.e. humans possess separate channels for processing visual and auditory information; (2) the limited capacity assumption, i.e. humans are limited in the amount of information that can be processed in each channel at one time (due to their limited working memory); and (3) the active processing assumption, i.e. humans engage in active learning by attending to relevant incoming information using their sensory memory, by organizing selected information into coherent mental representations in their working memory, and by integrating mental representations with other knowledge from their long-term memory. The theory also identifies three types of demands on the learner’s information processing system or capacity during learning: (1) essential processing, (2) extraneous processing, and (3) generative processing. Essential processing refers to cognitive processing aimed at mentally representing the presented material in working memory and is caused by the complexity of the material (also called intrinsic cognitive load). Extraneous processing refers to cognitive processing that does not support the instructional goal (also called extraneous cognitive load) - e.g. induced by the PowerPoint presentation or the way the lecturer teaches. And finally, generative processing refers to cognitive processing aimed at making sense of the presented material. This is caused by the learner’s motivation to learn (see also Darvin & Norton, 2021) (also called germane cognitive load). The aim of good multimedia instruction is to reduce extraneous load by respecting several principles. Examples are the redundancy principle (i.e. avoid presenting an additional source of information with nothing new for learners) and the modality principle (a mixed-mode – partly visual and partly auditory – presentation of the same information is more effective than a single-mode – either visual or auditory – presentation of the same information). Other important principles are the temporal and spatial contiguity principles, meaning that words and pictures should be presented simultaneously and close to each other.

# 3.2. Types of subtitles

As said before, subtitles can be intralingual (in the same language as the speaker) or interlingual (in another language), but also prepared or live. Prepared subtitles are subtitles produced beforehand by a subtitler, that is, before a television program is broadcast for example. On the other hand, live subtitles are produced in real time, while a television program is being broadcast, such as live interviews on television, or while a live event is going on, such as a conference or a lecture. There are different methods to produce these so-called (intralingual) live subtitles. Today, the preferred method is respeaking, a “technique in which a respeaker listens to the original sound of a (live) program or event and respeaks it, including punctuation marks [ …], to a speech recognition software, which turns the recognized utterances into subtitles displayed on the screen with the shortest possible delay” (Romero-Fresco, 2011, p. 1). However, other production methods can also be used: (1) different variants of fast typing; (2) trained automatic speech recognition (t-ASR) of the speaker’s voice, thus without the intervention of a respeaker, but with a speech recognition (SR) software trained with the speaker’s voice; and (3) fully automatic speech recognition (ASR) (i.e. without training of the speech recognition software). Additionally, subtitles can be shown in different formats: (1) in a block of two lines, (2) on a separate screen as a scrolling text, or even (3) as a scrolling text on an individual device, such as a portable PC or a tablet.

# 3.3. Research on the benefits of subtitling in an educational context

In educational design, subtitles are generally believed to increase extraneous cognitive load, impacting learning negatively, due to the redundancy effect (Mayer et al., 2001). Subtitles are an additional source of information with nothing new for learners because they already receive the same or similar information orally. However, in other fields such as Second Language Acquisition (SLA), subtitles have been shown to decrease cognitive load thanks to the visual support they provide. In other words, subtitles impact learning positively, which is in line with the modality principle, i.e. combining images with similar verbal information improves information processing (Kruger et al., 2014; Kruger & Steyn, 2013; Liao et al., 2020). For example, performance studies in SLA have shown that subtitling holds significant potential for vocabulary acquisition, listening comprehension and content comprehension (for an overview, see Incalcaterra McLoughlin, 2018).

The reception and in particular the beneficial educational effects of intralingual subtitles have not been studied much outside SLA. There are a few exceptions that focus on subtitled video lectures but not on a live setting. For example, Kruger and Steyn (2013) found no redundancy effect and although they did not find a modality effect either, they state that “subtitled audiovisual material may still add significant value to education because of the high correlation between subtitle reading and performance" (p. 118). Similarly, Kruger et al. (2014) compared visual attention distribution between L1 and L2 subtitles and other sources of information in a first-year Psychology class through eye tracking and did not observe a significant difference in performance between students watching a subtitled and an unsubtitled video lecture, but there was a significantly higher level of frustration in the unsubtitled condition. Finally,

Liao et al. (2020) compared effects of L1, L2 and bilingual (showing both L1 and L2) subtitles on L2 educational online videos about Planet Earth. They found no significant difference in comprehension between the subtitled and unsubtitled condition, but no redundancy effect either, hence no negative effect on learning.

# 3.4. Research on the benefits of live subtitling in an educational context

Research into live subtitling is very recent and limited in scope. It has mainly concentrated on the use of speech recognition, and particularly of respeaking, to produce live subtitles (e.g. Romero-Fresco & Alonso Bacigalupe, 2022); on training issues (e.g. Dawson & Romero-Fresco, 2021; Fresno & Romero-Fresco, 2022); and on quality issues (e.g. Romero-Fresco, 2021). In fact, the reception of intralingual live subtitles in an educational context has barely been investigated. There are only a few studies into the reception of live subtitling in an educational context, but they have a narrow focus: they concern subtitles in English in the US, produced with ASR. According to these studies, the live subtitles were of poor quality, and students perceived it badly (e.g. as distracting) when provided (Ryba et al., 2006). Furthermore, the quality of the generated subtitles was such that significant post-editing was required to render the subtitles suitable for use as lecture notes (Bain et al., 2002; Chan et al., 2019).

Robert et al. (2021) examined the effect of intralingual live subtitling of two lectures taught in Dutch on university students’ performance and perception. Regarding performance, students $( \mathrm { N } = 1 4 6 )$ ) performed significantly better in a comprehension and memory test when provided with subtitles than without subtitles. However, without objectively measuring if, when and how long the students read the subtitles, it is not possible to conclude that the improved performance was induced by the subtitles only, as stated by Kruger and Steyn (2013). Although the mere presence of subtitles did appear to improve the students’ performance in the study conducted by Robert et al. (2021), students only reported reading the subtitles rarely or sometimes, with low scores (on a 5-point Likert-scale) in both lectures. Still, based on previous research about subtitles on television, viewers read subtitles considerably more often than they think they do (d’Ydewalle & De Bruycker, 2007). The students’ reading behavior is therefore a very important factor and could only be confirmed with an eye tracking experiment. Perception scores overall were also relatively low. When asked whether they thought that the subtitles had helped them better understand and memorize the lecture and take better notes, students gave scores between “rather disagree” and “neutral”. The results regarding delay (i.e. the time between a word being pronounced by the speaker and its appearance on the screen) were between rather negative (‘too late’, ‘rather inconvenient’, ‘rather distracting’) and neutral. Interestingly, those who considered the delay “convenient” or “rather convenient” all reported the same reason: they could fall back on the subtitles if they did not hear or understand something. These findings might suggest that students learn to manage their cognitive process (i.e. metacognition) by using the subtitles and the delay more to their advantage. This points to a positive effect of subtitles, which may even be larger in the case of EMI due to worse vocabulary recognition. Another interesting finding, especially considering the current research, is that, when asked whether they thought that the provision of live intralingual subtitles would be more beneficial in a lecture in a foreign language, $8 0 \%$ of the students answered positively.

# 4. Methodology

The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of intralingual live subtitles on students’ performance and perception in EMI lectures, taking English proficiency level into account.

# 4.1. Experimental design

Our study consisted of five 2-h EMI Marketing lectures at the University of Antwerp, taught during the first semester of the first year of the BA in Economics in the academic year 2021–2022. This was the first time an EMI course was included in the curriculum that had been - until then - exclusively taught in Dutch. This course was taken by approximately 240 students.

During the first class, the students were informed by the Marketing professor that an experiment with live subtitling would take place during five lectures and that they could voluntarily participate in the study. The research project itself was then briefly introduced by the research team one week before the start of the study.

Before the beginning of the lectures with live subtitling, the students willing to participate were asked (1) to fill in an online questionnaire consisting of a consent form and a demographics part (section 4.2), and (2) to take an online English proficiency test (section 4.2). In both cases, they were asked to identify themselves using a unique code, chosen by themselves, that they would use in all questionnaires related to the study, for the researchers to be able to link the answers to each participant.

Subtitles were provided during five lectures: each lecture consisted of two parts of around $5 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , with a break of $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . In each lecture, half of part 1 and half of part 2 were provided with subtitles (around $2 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , see Table 1). Throughout all lectures, subtitled and unsubtitled sections alternated in a counterbalanced order to minimize any possible impact of order, memory, or tiredness. Students were allowed to take notes.

Live subtitling was provided alternately by two experienced respeakers, whose company is an established player in the translation and subtitling field in Flanders, and by extension in Belgium. They made use of Dragon Professional Individual, a speech recognition program. Using a Text-on-Top5 wireless captioning kit, the lecturer’s PowerPoint was projected with the subtitles (scrolling over two lines). Before the lectures, the respeakers were given the relevant PowerPoint presentations, so they could get the terminology ready in Dragon.

At the end of each lecture, students were requested to complete an online questionnaire (QualtricsXM) using their laptops or mobile phones but without consulting their notes. Questions relating to the content of the lecture (to measure performance) were asked in the online questionnaire after each lecture, whereas questions relating to perception (which were similar for all lectures) were asked every two classes to avoid attrition (section 4.2).

# 4.2. Material

Before the start of the study, the students who were willing to participate filled in a consent form and a demographics questionnaire, and took an online English proficiency test.

The demographics questionnaire consisted of five questions: gender, age, Dutch as L1 or L2, self-reported proficiency in English and whether they took the course for the first time. In total, 213 students filled in the consent and demographics form: $4 5 . 8 \%$ were male, $3 0 . 2 \%$ female and $7 . 0 \%$ indicated “other”. The mean age was 18.88. $7 3 \%$ reported having Dutch as their mother tongue (L1), while the other $2 7 \%$ reported being bilingual. Only 7 students were repeating the course. Regarding English proficiency, students were asked to self-assess their English language proficiency for Interaction, Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing on a scale from 1 (A1) to 6 (C2). This scale corresponds to the six different proficiency levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe, 2001). Their self-reported proficiency was between B1 and B2 level for speaking and writing and between B2 and C1 level for interaction, reading, and listening comprehension.

In addition, students were asked to take two certified language tests. To assess their listening proficiency by means of a listening comprehension test, we used the listening part of the 50-min Education First Standardized English Test (EFSET) (EF). Furthermore, we used the 3000, 4000 and 5000 level of the updated Vocabulary Levels Test, which is the most widely used measure of L2 lexical knowledge (Webb et al., 2017) or vocabulary size (Van Hoecke, 2023). In total, 135 students took the listening comprehension and vocabulary tests. Results of these four tests are summarized in Table 2.

The five lectures of the Marketing course tackled the topics listed in Table 3. The lecturer was an experienced professor in Marketing with a near-native level of English proficiency.

In this pilot study, ecological validity took priority over experimental control. In other words, the research team did not impose anything on the lecturer. Therefore, the lectures and their sections were not always completely comparable, nor could the content and speed of the lecture be controlled. Nevertheless, we ensured that, for each lecture, the duration of the unsubtitled sections was similar to that of the subtitled sections. Furthermore, we made sure that the subtitled and unsubtitled sections of each lecture created a cohesive, well-rounded unit of content. Lastly, we aimed to integrate a proportionately equal number of questions about content that had been covered in subtitled sections and in unsubtitled sections in the performance questionnaire.

At the end of each lecture, participants filled in a questionnaire aimed at measuring their performance (comprehension and memory). The performance was assessed by 12 questions per lecture (three questions per section, and thus, 6 questions for the subtitled condition and 6 for the unsubtitled condition). We ensured that each question followed the same format, consisting of five multiplechoice options with only one correct answer.

Every two lessons, the students also responded to a series of questions regarding perception. These questions focused on the students’ perception of the subtitles, that is, their difficulty, helpfulness, linguistic quality, delay and impact, and the students’ overall experience (a lecture with or without subtitles). The questions concerning perception were based on earlier research, including Di Giovanni (2018), Perego (2016), Robert et al. (2021), Romero-Fresco (2009, 2011), and Ryba et al. (2006). Since it was not feasible to use online tools like eye tracking to track students’ reading of the subtitles, due to limitations in the study design, we also asked participants to self-report on their subtitle reading behavior via a Likert-scale question on subtitle reading frequency (never $^ { = 1 }$ , rarely $= 2$ , sometimes $= 3$ , often $= 4$ , and always $= 5$ ).

# 5. Results and discussion

As explained in section 4.1, although 213 students filled in the consent and demographics form, only 135 students took the listening comprehension and vocabulary tests. Besides, not all students filled in the online questionnaire at the end of each lecture. In fact, the number of students who filled in the online questionnaire declined over the course of the five lectures, with 78 students in lecture 1, 53 students in lecture 2, 34 students in lecture 3, 25 students in lecture 4 and 16 students in lecture 5. Only seven students completed all questionnaires. Furthermore, not all students who filled in the online questionnaires at the end of at least one lecture had also taken the English proficiency tests before the start of the lecture series. Consequently, statistical results (Linear Mixed Models) will be based on students who filled in the consent and demographics form, took the English proficiency tests and filled in at least one online content questionnaire: respectively 36, 25, 18, 17 and 14 students for lectures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The average of the scores in lectures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is based on 432, 400, 216, 204 and 168 questions respectively. It has to be noted that we addressed outliers through the winsorizing method, i.e. we substituted outliers with the highest value that was not an outlier (Field, 2018, p. 262).6 This way, we reduced the impact of extreme values. Outliers might lead to erroneous conclusions, while the winsorizing method provides us now with more reliable outcomes, making it a useful tool for non-normal data.

# 5.1. Performance

To answer the first research question (RQ1: Do students perform better, i.e. comprehend, and remember the content better, when live subtitles are provided?) we started with a first Linear Mixed Model (Model 1) (Garcia, 2021) with the performance scores as dependent variable and the condition as fixed effect, i.e. with 3 parameters (performance score, condition, and residual). The model had a − 2 Log Likelihood of 2011.79.

As explained in the Methodology section, the performance scores reported in this section partly concern the same participants: 36 participants for lecture 1; 25 participants for lecture 2; 18 participants for lecture 3; 17 participants for lecture 4; and 14 participants for lecture 5. Consequently, we added the participant IDs as a random effect. This second model (Model 2) with 4 parameters had a $^ { - 2 }$ Log Likelihood of 1998.77. To determine whether this model was a better fit, we compared both − 2 Log Likelihood estimations (Field, 2018, p. 947). Model 2 was significantly better: the difference in − 2 Log Likelihood was 13,02, whereas the minimal difference with 1 degree of freedom (4 parameters compared to 3 parameters in the first model) is 3.84 at $p = 0 . 0 5$ .

Results show that the condition, i.e. subtitled lecture versus unsubtitled lecture, significantly predicted the performance score, $F$ $( 1 1 7 9 . 9 3 ) = 5 . 6 0 , p = 0 . 0 1 5 .$ . The estimate of the fixed effect is 7.01, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In other words, the performance increases by 7.01 points in the subtitled condition. Indeed, the participants’ mean score in the subtitled condition was $6 2 . 4 7 \%$ compared to $5 5 . 5 9 \%$ in the unsubtitled condition. In other words, participants performed significantly better in the subtitled condition than in the unsubtitled condition. This is in line with the findings of Robert et al. (2021), and with other earlier research from Kruger and Steyn (2013) and Liao et al. (2020), as our results suggest a modality effect rather than a redundancy effect.

Before answering RQ2, we also added the parameter ‘Lesson’ as additional fixed effect, to determine whether the lesson and thus the variability of the content had an impact on performance. This model had a $^ { - 2 }$ Log Likelihood of 1984.55, with 5 parameters. In other words, the model was a better fit. However, the effect of the lesson was not significant, so we decided not to include the lesson as parameter in the subsequent models.

To answer the second research question (RQ2: Does performance vary with the students’ level of proficiency in English?), we added the scores for the listening comprehension test as fixed effect to the second model. This third model (Model 3A) with 5 parameters had a $^ { - 2 }$ Log Likelihood of 1989.93. Model 3A was significantly better than Model 2: the difference in $^ { - 2 }$ Log Likelihood was 9.343, whereas the minimal difference with 1 degree of freedom (5 parameters compared to 4 parameters in the first model) is 3.84 at $p =$ 0.05).

Results show that the condition, i.e. subtitled lecture versus unsubtitled lecture, significantly predicted the performance score, $F$ $( 1 1 7 8 . 5 4 ) = 5 , 9 6 ,$ , $p = 0 . 0 1 6$ , when accounting for the listening comprehension score. The estimate of the fixed effect was 7.01, as illustrated in Fig. 2. However, the listening comprehension score did not significantly predict the performance score, $F ( 1 , 3 9 . 0 3 ) =$

2.87, $p > 0 . 0 5$ . We added an interaction effect between condition and listening score in the model, but the model was not significantly better and the interaction effect was not significant, $F ( 1 1 7 7 . 5 6 ) = . 7 1$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ . In other words, the performance increases by 7.01 points in the subtitled condition. Although participants tended to perform better on the comprehension test when their listening comprehension increased, this trend is not significant. Phrased differently, the listening comprehension was not a significant predictor of the performance. However, the positive effect of the subtitles did persist in general when considering the listening comprehension scores. In other words, also after adding the listening test as covariate, the significantly better performance with subtitles remains present. On another note, the subtitles seemed to help those with lower listening comprehension. This might be explained by the fact that subtitles could help to retrieve words that were not understood correctly by the audience: if one did not understand what was said (for example, due to a low listening proficiency), the missed segment was shown afterwards in the subtitles, which enhances comprehension, and possibly performance as well.

Subsequently, we built the same model, but each time with the vocabulary 3000, 4000 and 5000 level tests respectively in a separate model. These models are called 3B, 3C and 3D. They have the same number of parameters, i.e. 5.

Model 3B (including vocabulary 3000 test) was significantly better than model 2, according to the same calculation method as for the difference between model 2 and 3A (see appendix). Results show that the condition, i.e. subtitled lecture versus unsubtitled lecture, significantly predicted the performance score, $F ( 1 1 8 3 . 3 0 ) = 5 . 9 7 $ , $p = 0 . 0 1 6$ , when accounting for the 3000 vocabulary test. The estimate of the fixed effect of the condition is 7.01, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The vocabulary 3000 test score also significantly predicted the performance score, $F ( 1 , 4 4 . 5 1 ) = 1 9 . 4 7 $ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ . The estimate of the fixed effect of the vocabulary test is 4.88. We added an interaction effect between the condition and the vocabulary 3000 test score in the model, but the model was not significantly better and the interaction effect was not significant, $F ( 1 1 8 2 . 3 9 ) = . 7 5 $ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ . In other words, both condition and vocabulary test are significant predictors of performance on comprehension tests. Students performed better when provided with subtitles (which increased performance by 7 points), but students also performed better when their performance on the vocabulary test (3000) increased (an increase of 1 point in the vocabulary test results in an increase of 4.88 points in performance on the comprehension test). However, there is no significant interaction between these two variables, i.e. the former does not impact the latter or vice versa.

Model 3C (including vocabulary 4000 test) was significantly better than model 2, according to the same calculation method as for the difference between model 2 and 3A (see appendix). Results show that the condition, i.e. subtitled lecture versus unsubtitled lecture, significantly predicted the performance score, $F ( 1 1 7 7 . 5 6 ) = 5 . 9 0$ , $p = 0 . 0 1 6$ , when accounting for the vocabulary test (4000). The estimate of the fixed effect is 7.00, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The vocabulary 4000 test score also significantly predicted the performance score, $\operatorname { F } ( 1 , 2 8 . 1 3 ) = 1 6 . 5 8$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ . The estimate of the fixed effect of the vocabulary test is 2.91. We added an interaction effect between the condition and the vocabulary 4000 test score in the model, but the model was not significantly better and the interaction effect was not significant, $F ( 1 1 7 6 . 4 9 ) = 1 . 8 4$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ . In other words, both condition and vocabulary test are significant predictors of performance on comprehension tests. Students performed better when provided with subtitles (increased performance by 7 points), but students also performed better when their performance on the vocabulary test (4000) increased (an increase of 1 point in the vocabulary test results in an increase of 2.91 points in performance on the comprehension test). However, there is no significant interaction between these two variables.

Fig. 4. Performance scores in relation to condition and 4000 vocabulary level test (Model 3C).

Model 3D (including vocabulary 5000 test) was significantly better than model 2, according to the same calculation method as for the difference between model 2 and 3A (see appendix). Results show that the condition, i.e. subtitled lecture versus unsubtitled lecture, significantly predicted the performance score, $F ( 1 1 8 2 . 4 8 ) = 6 . 0 0$ , $p = 0 . 0 1 5$ , when accounting for the vocabulary 5000 test. The estimate of the fixed effect is 7.01, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The vocabulary 5000 test score also significantly predicted the performance score, $F ( 1 , 5 1 . 0 2 ) = 1 4 . 1 7 $ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ . The estimate of the fixed effect of the vocabulary test is 1.83. We added an interaction effect between the condition and the vocabulary 5000 test score in the model, but the model was not significantly better and the interaction effect was not significant, $F ( 1 1 8 1 . 5 4 ) = . 3 4$ , $\mathsf { p } > 0 . 0 5$ . In other words, both condition and vocabulary test are significant predictors of performance on comprehension tests. Students perform better when provided with subtitles (increased performance by 7 points), but students also perform better when their performance on the vocabulary test (5000) increases (an increase of 1 point in the vocabulary test results in an increase of 1.83 points in performance on the comprehension test). However, there is no significant interaction between these two variables. In other words, in all three models (3B, 3C, 3D), the main effect of the subtitles persisted even after the addition of a second fixed effect (vocabulary test). Moreover, when it comes to the vocabulary tests, subtitles seemed to help those with higher scores, and actually have negative effect on those with lower scores. This might point to a correlation between vocabulary knowledge and performance: the more vocabulary knowledge one has, the more words one recognizes in the subtitles, the more one can use them to enhance performance. On the other hand, the less vocabulary knowledge one has, the less words one recognizes in the subtitles, the more performance is hindered because the subtitles are not an added value (anymore) and can even distract the students.

# 5.2. Perception

To answer the third research question (RQ3: How do students perceive the presence and quality of subtitles (e.g. disruptive, helpful, distracting, qualitative, demanding, etc.) and the impact of subtitles on their performance?), the perception questionnaires gave insight into the participants’ perception of the subtitles, of their reading behavior and the lecture difficulty. Perception is reported here exclusively by descriptive statistics, and only with reference to 53 participants in lecture 2 and 34 participants in lecture 3.7 Four of the questions were related to the helpfulness of the subtitles. All three were Likert-scale statements with five levels of agreement: (1) completely disagree, (2) disagree, (3) neutral, (4) slightly agree, (5) completely agree.

![](img/ac978a5512edf278b19d37299ac1d331103f9c8c71604da24da0dfc15829404e.jpg)  
Fig. 5. Performance scores in relation to condition and 5000 vocabulary level test (Model 3D).

• Q1: The subtitles helped me to understand the class better.   
• Q2: I think I have remembered more from the lecture thanks to the live subtitles.   
• Q3: Thanks to the live subtitles, I was able to take better notes.   
• Q4: I think most students would benefit from following lectures with live subtitling.

As shown in Fig. 6, the general sentiment among students remained neutral regarding the perceived utility of subtitles. Responses generally leaned towards neutrality, maintaining an average rating of around two and a half. Similar, although slightly more positive, trends were observed regarding the overall perspective of students when asked whether most students would derive benefits from attending lectures with live subtitling. All in all, these findings are in line with the perception results of Robert et al. (2021) since the students were in general not very positive towards the subtitles.

Participants were also asked about their perception of subtitle quality, evaluated in terms of spelling, formulation, and content, in five-point Likert-scale questions.

• Q1: The spelling in the subtitles was most of the time … (Likert-scale from ‘very bad’ to ‘very good’) • Q2: The formulation of the subtitles was most of the time … (Likert-scale from ‘very unclear’ to ‘very clear’) • Q3: The content of the subtitles was most of the time … (Likert-scale from ‘incomplete’ to ‘complete’)

As illustrated in Fig. 7, the findings suggest that students’ assessments of quality ranged from ‘neutral’ to ‘good’. The articulation and orthography of subtitles exhibit a distinctly favorable trend, thereby affirming the theoretical framework positing that respeaking yields high quality subtitles (see section 3.2). Furthermore, this positive trend remains consistently stable, generating the same quality standard week after week, which also had been confirmed in the study of Robert et al. (2021).

Fig. 7. Quality of the subtitles.

Additionally, we asked participants four questions about the delay in subtitle projection. These were phrased as statements in the form of a five-point Likert-scale (except Q1).

• Q1: The subtitles were on the screen for (multiple choice with three elements, i.e. ‘too long’, ‘too short’ and ‘long enough’, with 1 for ‘too long’, 1 for ‘too short’ and 2 for ‘long enough’, since ‘too long’ cannot be considered better or worse than ‘too short’)… • Q2: The subtitles were presented on the screen … (from ‘much too late’ to ‘on time’) • Q3: When the subtitles were presented later than the words of the speaker, it was … (from ‘not useful at all to ‘very useful’) • Q4: When the subtitles were presented later than the words of the speaker, it was … (from ‘very disturbing to ‘not disturbing at all’)

As shown in Fig. 8, the students were positive about the duration of the subtitles and this feeling appears consistent across lectures. Approximately $7 5 \%$ of the students in both lectures indicated that the subtitles remained on screen long enough. This implies that only $2 5 \%$ of the students perceived the subtitles as shown either too briefly or for too long. However, mean results regarding delay fall between 2 and 3, signifying that students’ perception ranged from rather negative (‘too late’, ‘not very useful, ‘rather disturbing’) to neutral. This perception seems to remain stable across both lectures. Notably, satisfaction with the delay is low, indicating that the delay was perceived as too long, aligning with the theoretical framework (see section 3.2). The second question delves into the use of the delay, an unexpected yet relevant question inspired by a similar study conducted by Robert et al. (2021). In contrast to the positive findings of that study, the overall satisfaction of our participants remained neutral, although they also occasionally found the delay beneficial for revisiting unclear elements of the spoken content. Thus, the results in general tend towards neutrality, with the only exception being the somewhat prolonged delay.

As said before, the perception part of the online questionnaires also dealt with the self-reported attention paid to the subtitles and the difficulty of the lectures, two factors that may influence performance and perception.

Attention paid to the subtitles appeared to be limited, since most students stated that they had rarely looked at the subtitles in both lecture 2 $( 3 9 . 6 \% )$ and lecture 3 $( 3 8 . 2 \% )$ . The mean scores for both lectures were low, $M = 2 . 2 8$ and $M = 2 . 0 3$ , respectively. All details are shown in Table 4. Nevertheless, “switching attention from the visual image to ‘reading’ the subtitles happens effortlessly and almost automatically”, according to d’Ydewalle and De Bruycker (2007: 196), which implies that the students might have looked at the subtitles more than they realized and/or reported in the perception questionnaire.

Finally, as far as lecture difficulty is concerned, students considered the two lectures to be of a similar complexity, since the average difficulty scores were respectively 2.91 and 2.71 for lecture 2 and 3, on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from easy (1) to challenging (5). Furthermore, in response to an open-ended question, the students also had the opportunity to provide us with additional comments about the subtitles. Students referred in well over half the cases to the delay of the live subtitling, which they found too long and therefore perceived negatively. The second most frequent set of remarks centered on the issue of subtitles overlapping with information on the slides, hindering proper readability. It is important to note that this could easily have been mitigated with additional space at the bottom of the presentation, though this was beyond our control. The second least common category of remarks concerned the accuracy of the subtitles, followed by occasional remarks on language use and subtitle redundancy. In other words, the delay received the most comments, which is what we anticipated, because of the theoretical framework and previous research. These two starting points were thus seamlessly confirmed.

# 6. Conclusion

This pilot study investigated the impact of intralingual live subtitles on both performance and perception in five EMI lectures in Flanders. The findings demonstrate that, on average, when considering all lectures taken together, students’ performance with subtitles was significantly higher than their performance without them. This effect persisted even when considering the listening comprehension score. However, listening comprehension was not a significant predictor of performance (comprehension and memory). In addition, we could not find a significant interaction effect either between performance scores or listening scores. However, the scores on the 3000, 4000 and 5000 level vocabulary tests were all significant predictors of performance on the comprehension and memory test. In other words, both subtitles and English proficiency measured through vocabulary tests predicted how students would perform on comprehension and memory tests. However, no significant interaction effect between subtitles and English vocabulary proficiency was found, which means the latter does not impact on the former and vice versa.

The positive impact of subtitles on student performance aligns with the findings of earlier research (see sections 3.3 and 3.4). In other words, it suggests the presence of a modality effect rather than a redundancy effect. However, it is essential to interpret these results with caution since the students reported minimal engagement with the subtitles during the lectures.

The students exhibited a largely indifferent stance towards the intralingual live subtitles, expressing overall neutrality regarding whether live subtitles improved their understanding or retention of lecture material. This sentiment extended to their perception of the potential improvement in notetaking and the overall utility of the subtitles. They expressed dissatisfaction with the time it took for subtitles to appear on screen (delay), although they were generally satisfied with the duration of subtitle projection. However, this satisfaction could not fully offset the frustration stemming from the delay, as clearly conveyed in responses to the open-ended question. This contrasts with a study by Robert et al. (2021), where students capitalized on the delay by using them as a backup when they missed information from the lecturer. Concluding on a positive note regarding perception, the students were fairly satisfied with the quality of the subtitles (in terms of spelling, formulation, and content).

In summary, the results of this study imply that intralingual live subtitling could be beneficial in an educational setting for all students, particularly and perhaps most notably, for those whose first language is not the language of instruction. If subtitles prove to have a positive impact on students who genuinely benefit from them without causing any disruption to people who do not require them, then there appears to be a compelling case for their widespread adoption.

As previously mentioned, this study has several limitations, such as the unequal set-up of the student population, the inherent challenge of collecting comparable data in designs incorporating at least one within-variable, and the lack of online tools to measure subtitle reading behavior. Next, perception could not be added in the model(s) since the measures were not taken for each lecture. It is crucial to acknowledge that this investigation represents a pilot study. Its purpose is to lay the groundwork for our first main study, the design of which will involve a similar data collection methodology, but will encompass more lectures conducted over a longer period, taking into account academic motivation and metacognition, as well as alternative approaches to subtitle production (respeaking versus automatic subtitling).
