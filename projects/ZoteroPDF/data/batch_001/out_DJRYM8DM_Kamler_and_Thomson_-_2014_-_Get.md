# Getting on top of the research literatures

Supervisors need more than metaphors and models of writing about literatures. They need strategies that will take the doctoral researcher from feeling awash in a sea of information to finding patterns and making sense. Doctoral researchers need guidance to make economic notes, to sort and sift to the point where they can write a tightly argued case for their work. Ultimately they need to locate their research in the literatures, indicate which texts are most helpful and suggest how their contribution builds on and takes forward previous scholarship.

Supervisors typically give new doctoral researchers a suggested reading list to get started. Handbooks and review articles on key concepts are recommended as a sensible way of getting into some of the key ideas in a field. But doctoral researchers also go on their own independent searches. When they google, go to the library, use the recommended data bases and end up with long lists of random books and articles, they don’t know what to do. Getting the best search terms relies on detailed knowledge of the field, something beginning doctoral researchers cannot, by definition, have. In Fairclough’s terms, they need to know layer 3 (see Chapter 2). When they get a metaphorical or literal mass of reading material, they don’t know how to decide what’s important and what’s not.

Doctoral researchers typically present with a number of questions which encapsulate their dilemma and anxieties:

How do I know which writers are more important than others to read? There’s so much here, how do I find the time to read it all? The writers all seem to be saying different things in these books and articles. How can I make any sense of it?

In the first section of this chapter we offer three strategies for dealing with this initial confusion about the sheer volume of knowledge doctoral researchers need to conquer. In the second we tackle the equally difficult issue of making economical notes and mapping the field. Finally, we focus on ways to write about literatures. These strategies produce a more hands-on, interactive textual position for supervisors than is usually suggested in books available on supervision. While our illustrations are specific, we assume supervisors will remake these for their own disciplinary and institutional contexts.

# Getting started: orienting to the LR

In order to understand the nature of the LR work and reduce its enormity, we suggest four key conversation topics supervisors might raise in an early meeting with new doctoral researchers.

# 1 What’s in your field?

The knowledge produced in a scholarly field is usually presented in peer reviewed articles and books. These days it can also be found in blogs and the quality press. However, relevant literatures may well include a range of other materials. Advanced knowledge is also produced by governments, by industries, and by all manner of quangos (Beck, 1992; Burton-Jones, 2003; Delanty, 2001; Gibbons et al., 1994). At a time when what people think is influenced by media, by information freely available on the web, and by populist texts (Franklin, 1999; Seaton, 1998; Taylor et al., 1997), these sources may also be highly relevant to the doctoral researcher. Doctoral researchers may find the ‘gap’ their research aims to fill derives from a cultural, professional or policy issue, as opposed to coming simply from scholarly activity. The ‘literature’ for these doctoral researchers may include a substantial corpus of ‘non-academic’ materials.

It can be helpful for doctoral researchers to make an initial list of the various sources they need to use.

# 2 You don’t have to read it all

In undertaking any LR work, doctoral researchers need to understand that the task is simultaneously about knowing some texts in detail, but also understanding the shape of the field and where a particular text fits in relation to others. Bayard (2007) in his provocative book entitled How to talk about books you haven’t read, offers a helpful way to think about this dual task.

Bayard uses the term collective library to describe the totality of texts available on a topic. He suggests it is important to understand the shape of the collective library as well as the relationships that elements of the whole have with each other. Readers need not only take account of the content of any text that they read, but also its location in relation to those that they have not read. It is their capacity to understand the place of a book within the collective library that makes it possible to merely skim the contents in order to grasp its most essential points.

Bayard also talks about an inner library, a subset of the collective library. An inner library includes those books which have made a deep impression on the reader, as well as those that are most useful and used. These are particular books which orient readers to the library in general. It is important for doctoral researchers to understand that every scholar in the field assembles their own inner library, the set of texts that help them come to grips with key ideas, debates, gaps and blind spots. While there may be some key texts that must be read, these may only need to be skimmed so the broad contribution and its location, its relationship to and place in the rest of the library, is understood – rather than its every detail.

It is helpful for doctoral researchers to continually work on their list of reading to determine which is the collective and which the inner library, to be read in great detail.

# 3 Identify the patterns and groups

Doctoral researchers need to understand that firstly, they have to establish groupings within the LR and second find patterns that exist within groups. Groupings are formed because texts address the same topic or take the same epistemological approach or use the same methods or the same samples or have similar concerns. The majority of doctoral researchers in the arts and sciences will be undertaking a traditional review rather than one which is ‘evidenced-based’ and groupings rely on their analytic skills. This kind of interpretation of a field often feels too subjective, and it is thus important for them to make explicit the criteria on which they have constructed their groupings.

Within and across groupings, it is often possible to see a pattern or patterns. These could, for example, be disciplinary or they may be chronological. For example, feminist work on families, work and education, each of which could be a very large group, may be patterned by the concerns of first, second and third waves of feminism.

Groups and patterns can be a helpful way to initially organize the LR in a thesis proposal. These can be flagged up at the start of the text to form a kind of road map for locating the study.

It is also helpful, early on, to read some finished LRs and look for the patterns and groups that have been used. That is, doctoral researchers can learn to read not only for content, but for the structural and epistemological decisions that have been made in the text.

# 4 Understand the task and why it is ongoing

Doctoral researchers need to understand that the thesis LR comes in two versions – confirmation (early) and thesis (late). Both are based on a critical assessment of their selection of material, but have different purposes.

Jesson and colleagues (2011) offer five different variants of the traditional review. None of these are completely separate, in fact they overlap quite considerably. Nevertheless, there are some discernible differences in purpose and process. The five types of LR they suggest are:

(a) a conceptual review. This synthesizes and critically assesses literature to see the way in which a particular issue is understood. The conceptual review might also examine how the issue is researched, how those understandings are produced. Its purpose is to produce a greater understanding of the issue.

(b) a state-of-the-art review. This examines the most recent contributions to a field or area of study in the light of its history of research. It particularly looks for trends, agreements and debates. This is the kind of review that editors of journals write at periodic intervals in order to position their journal and its future directions.   
(c) an expert review. Rather like the state-of-the-art review, but undertaken by a senior fi gure in the fi eld and heavily infl ected with their own particular interests and contributions. This is the kind of review that presidents of learned societies give to the assembled masses at a conference.

The next variation is the one that is undertaken at the start of the doctorate or in a research bid in order to position the new research project:

(d) the scoping review. This review sets out to create an agenda for future research. It documents what is already known about a topic, and then focuses on the gaps, niches, disputes, blank and blind spots. It delineates key concepts, questions and theories in order to refine the research question(s) and justify an approach to be taken.

The final variation is the literature review as it appears in the final humanities/ social science thesis or in a journal article or book, after the research has been completed.

(e) the traditional review. This is somewhat like a scoping review, but its argument is not to create the space for a research project. It is to position a piece of research that has already been undertaken. In essence the reader gets what’s-already-known, plus the newly conducted research as the contribution. The literature is used to locate the what-we-now-know-that-we-didn’tbefore-and-why-this-is-important. Some texts and themes from the initial scoping review are omitted, and other things are now emphasized in order to make clear the connections and continuities, similarities and differences of the new research to what’s gone before.

So, (d) scoping and (e) traditional don’t do the same job. They have different purposes. One justifies the research to be done, the other locates the contribution in the field of completed research.

The obvious implication of this difference is that doctoral researchers can’t just dump the early literature work from their proposal into the thesis text. They have to do more work on the literatures when writing the thesis. The initial text has to be modified – not just because more has been read, but because the purpose and argument are different.

# Scanning, noting and mapping the LR

It is common for supervisors to advise doctoral researchers about the importance of keeping records, possibly by using bibliographic software, of making detailed notes on their reading, and of the horrors of being in the end stages of the thesis and not being able to locate ‘the quote’. This work requires accuracy, organization and care. Perhaps institutions assume that doctoral researchers arrive already knowing how to do this work. But even a cursory read of PhD blogs and twitter conversations suggests that this is not the case. There seems to be an unending appetite for discussion about how to economically note and compile notes as the basis for the LR.

Busy supervisors, often with heavy supervision loads, do not have time to give individual tuition on scanning, noting and mapping to each and every doctoral researcher. This is clearly a place where some form of institutional support could be both efficient and welcome.

We suggest three strategies that institutions might take up as part of a doctoral researcher induction program: scan reading, note-taking and mapping.

# Scan reading

# 1 Scanning an article: don’t write a word

Scanning a large number of articles allows the doctoral researcher to get a sense of what’s out there and what might be most relevant to the proposed study. After scanning, they can return and read in more detail the articles that seem most pertinent. To guide this process we suggest doctoral researchers:

Read the title of the article;   
Read the abstract;   
Read the introduction, headings, the first and last sentence of each paragraph and the conclusion;   
Tell a colleague researcher what they think the article is about.

During this exercise doctoral researchers do not highlight the text or write a note. We tell them to sit on their hands to interrupt their habituated practice of reading with a marker in hand, missing the forest because they are fixated on individual trees. If they have real difficulty focusing on the lines of text, they can use a ruler – but no pen. Doctoral researchers are often surprised by how much they know about the article from this scanning.

Many of us have learned that reading an article always requires underlining and noting. We suggest that noting can come after a first reading and that the highlighting and writing on the actual text are best left for a second detailed read, if it is required. This kind of scan reading may show that the article belongs to the collective, rather than the inner library (Bayard, 2007).

It also pulls out the ‘skeleton’ and the argument moves in the article. It helps the reader understand how academic writing works. The use of headings, topic sentences for paragraphs, titles, abstracts and conclusions are the ‘red thread’ that makes a piece of scholarly writing coherent.

# 2 Scanning a book: Is it worth reading?

Reading a book takes far more time and commitment than a journal article. It is important for time-pressured doctoral researchers to decide whether a book needs to be read carefully or not. The author and the publisher leave some clues to help make this decision. We suggest doctoral researchers:

Read the title of the book.   
Because publishers are now wary of clever book titles that make the reader guess what’s inside, they usually make either the main title or its strap line something quite specific. For example, our most recent book entitled Writing for peer reviewed journals: strategies for getting published (Thomson and Kamler, 2013) makes it pretty clear what the reader can expect to find inside. Read the blurb on the back.   
This has been specifically written to tell the reader about the book’s purpose, something of its contents and the academic discipline to which it contributes.   
Read the titles of chapters.   
When these are accurately and cogently described, they give an adequate idea of what is covered in the text.   
If the book is still of interest, then do some pre-reading.   
These days, publishers and book-sellers offer sample chapters online. In a book-shop or at a publishers’ stand at a conference it is easy to scan the introduction where the writer provides a mandate for the book and outlines its chapters. Figures and tables can be checked and, if there is time, the prospective reader can even selectively sample the odd page here and there to get a sense of the style and tone.

This activity should establish the book’s disciplinary location, its intended contribution, something of its argument and a little about the way it marshals evidence. The reader will have formed a view about whether this is a book to buy, or get from the library, or one they won’t bother with now but may come back to later.

# Note-taking

The purpose of reading closely and note-taking is always to connect the literature to the proposed study, not simply to summarize an article or book. The synthesis must occur, but always in connection with the doctoral research.

There is only one maxim about note-taking – don’t rewrite the book or article. It’s a waste of time and it misses the point. The point is to understand what the writer is claiming and arguing. The doctoral researcher should be able to explain succinctly to someone else what the text is about. This process of making sense and interpreting the text is important not only for immediate understanding, but also for the ways it can be used to make the LR argument later.

# 1 Making notes from an article

The key move is to write the argument and the claim of the paper in no more than three to four sentences. This requires disciplined thinking.

If the article deserves close study, then further questions can help focus the note-taking (Figure 4.1.) If these questions are answered as bullets and a small number of sentences or phrases, the answers can easily be entered on any of the digital referencing systems that are then searchable and retrievable.

![](img/0a5c4f41c09f165d326c788c543a8ab51656f86ca289b7e6212544fc814fb629.jpg)  
Figure 4.1 Detailed questions for note taking. (http://patthomson.wordpress. com/2012/03/03/doing-your-literature-review-taking-notes/)

Once these questions are answered, articles can be grouped in different ways – around definitions, different aspects of the topic, methods, theoretical approaches, epistemological traditions. The doctoral researcher has created a systematic and defensible basis on which to develop their groupings and patterns.

# 2 Making notes from a book

Clearly the doctoral researcher can’t rewrite the book and they shouldn’t try. We suggest that one effective strategy is to first read the book right through, taking a minimal number of notes, perhaps using Post-it® notes. Immediately on finishing, a summary of the book can be written in no more than a paragraph. It should include something about the purpose of the book and the problem or issue the author is addressing. It should sum up the argument and state the claim made by the author – the point they are trying to make.

If the book warrants closer attention, it might be useful for the doctoral researcher to write a very short outline about each move of the argument – a move may be a single chapter or more than one. This should show the way in which each chapter is related to the next and indicate any key ways in which the text is connected to the researcher’s own study. This might include evidence used, theoretical approach, connection with other literatures. At the end of this structural mapping, the researcher will have no more than a couple of pages of notes which can be entered on to whatever digital software platform is being used.

A very close read is something that is done with a relatively small number of texts – those people who are seated closest to the doctoral researcher at the dinner table. It might include a systematic exploration of the writer’s language, and investigation of the resources (citations, agreements and disagreements) that are used. It may well be that it is the writer’s work rather than a single book that is being studied and this will require the doctoral researcher to become familiar with their overall propositions, changes in their arguments over time, and the various influences on their development and ideas.

When focusing in on any particular writer or school of thought, it is critical for the doctoral researcher to be clear about what is offered in relation to the larger problem/puzzle/phenomenon compared to others in the field. What is the unique contribution this text or group of texts offers?

# Mapping: put the groups and patterns together

Hart, a scholar who has devoted an entire book to ‘doing literature reviews’ and another to literature searches, recommends mapping as an important part of reviewing the literatures.

Mapping ideas is about setting out, on paper, the geography of research and thinking that has been done on a topic. At one level, it is about identifying what has been done, when it was done, what methods were used and who did what. At another level, it is about identifying links between what has been done, to show the thinking that has influenced what has been produced.

(Hart, 1998: 144)

Hart suggests a number of methods for mapping ideas, arguments and concepts. These include feature maps (making a summary schema of arguments proposed by a study and similarities/differences with other studies on the topic); tree constructions (showing the way major topics develop sub-themes and related questions); and content maps (organizing a topic into its various hierarchical arrangements). These techniques are useful. They help doctoral researchers identify connections between ideas and arguments and identify relationships that exist between individual pieces of work.

Our approach to mapping places more emphasis on identitywork and the relationships between different bodies of research. In selecting, rejecting and categorizing research, doctoral researchers are actively framing their study. They are entering a conversation with other scholars via texts. They are finding out where their research ‘fits’ in relation to those fields and sharpening their own arguments.

As preparation for making a visual map, we ask doctoral researchers to talk about their difficulties in selecting and categorizing bodies of research. We ask about inclusions and exclusions, their worries about who to put in and who to leave out. The physical act of making a visual representation helps doctoral researchers produce new connections. Shifting to another modality helps them see things more graphically and often produces new insights. Maps can identify gaps in their control of literatures, and/or consolidate their thinking to date and make it visible.

Mapping strategies can be used at various points of candidature, recursively, as doctoral researchers progress and revise their understandings of the field of knowledge production. Sometimes they will not be able to do the mapping. Perhaps it is too early or they are not yet able to think about their contribution to the field. But this inability is also useful information. At times like these, supervisors can jointly construct maps with doctoral researchers, calling on the supervisor’s greater knowledge of the field.

Supervisors can also do effective pedagogical work by modelling maps that inform their own research. Julie McLeod, an Australian colleague, runs an online seminar for doctoral candidates on reviewing literatures, where she asks students to identify key players and debates in the diverse fields in which they’re researching. As preparation for their online contribution, she models how her own research intersects with diverse bodies of research that shape her inquiry. This is an excerpt from her mapping.

The 12 to 18 Project is a longitudinal research project, which studied girls and boys as they go through each year of their secondary schooling and into their first years of post-school life. The project is concerned with the development of young people’s identity and with education, and with the interactions between these in Australia today . . . My project intersects with many different fields and styles of research in terms of its substantive research focus (literature on youth studies, schooling differences and school effects, gender and class differences, identity development), its methodological focus (literature on interviewing, longitudinal studies, the role of the researcher and researcher reflexivity) and in terms of theoretical interests (literature on identity formation, accounts of modernity and social change, feminist discussions of gender) . . . I can nominate several ‘key players’.

One example is a recent book by Valerie Walkerdine, Helen Lucey and June Melody (2001), Growing Up Girl: Psycho-social explorations on Gender, Class, which addresses several issues that are also of concern for The 12 to 18 Project. First, Growing Up Girl is based upon a longitudinal, qualitative study of young women from age 4 to 21; it explores gender and class differences and identities, and theorizes social change and late modernity. Second, the authors are very well known, and Walkerdine especially has a strong international reputation for her innovative research on gender and identity and social and educational change. Third, while the empirical research is based in the UK, there is some overlap in social and educational trends and there are some parallel methodological and theoretical interests. Fourth, although the specific foci and analyses developed in Growing Up Girl are not the same as the ones we develop, it is clear that we need to engage with the ideas and identify how our work is different from it, and delineate any criticisms we might have of the approach and analyses. Finally, given the reputations of the authors, their previous work, and the book’s close relationship to our own project, not to engage with this work would be seen as a serious omission. Further, judging from the attention the book is receiving from other scholars, it is going to be a ‘key player’ not only for our research but for the larger field of psycho-social research on young people and class/gender identities.

(McLeod, 2005)

McLeod’s mapping makes visible the kind of grouping and patterning experienced researchers engage in when locating their own work in the field. She identifies groups of literatures from different disciplines, but which have different methodological approaches. She also identifies a pattern of theoretical interests which cross over the groupings. One key set of writers are identified together with one key text which overlap significantly the work she intends to do. She uses these overlaps as building blocks and the difference as the warrant for her particular research.

Such texts from experienced researchers can be used in multiple ways with doctoral researchers, and we turn to consider how they might be used to model location and occupation strategies.

# Writing about the literatures

It is easy for doctoral researchers to lose sight of their ‘contribution’ to the field. To encourage them to make space for their own work, we have developed three strategies which supervisors might use to assist their doctoral researchers identify gaps or trends in a field. These are: reading expert LRs, side-by-side writing and sentence skeletons.

# Reading expert LRs

The supervisor might collect sample LRs written by experienced researchers in particular fields. These can be examined to determine how expert scholars write. In order to read like a ‘writer’, doctoral researchers need guidance, in particular, to get some sense of the generic conventions being used in different fields. This is productive textwork which makes visible things that are otherwise just read over. Such reading contributes to a growing sense of what is possible in writing academic texts.

To illustrate, we consider two LR excerpts. The first comes from a research article by Patricia Dunsmire (1997), from the field of critical linguistics. The second is from a book introduction by Ken Jones (2003) on education in Britain.

Dunsmire’s article, ‘Naturalizing the future in factual discourse: a critical linguistic analysis of a projected event’, analyses the front-page coverage from the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers during the 1990 Persian Gulf Crisis, 3–7 August. This excerpt comes from the beginning of the article, where she reviews a wide body of research in an economical way in order to situate her own approach. We number her sentences so we can refer to particular strategies used by the writer.

[1] The study builds on and contributes to work in critical linguistics (Caldas-Coulthard and Coulthard, 1996; Chilton, 1982; Fairclough, 1989, 1992a, 1992b; Fowler, 1991; Fowler, Hodge, Kress and Trew, 1979; Seidel, 1985; Van Dijk, 1989, 1991; Wodak, 1989). [2] Although studies in critical linguistics have examined the discursive construction of past events, there has not been an extended study of the construction of a projected event. [3] As such, this study provides additional insight into the constructive processes of language by explicating the linguistic and rhetorical processes through which a projected—future—event is constructed as a discrete and autonomous state of affairs. [4] The analytic focus on a projected event enables another contribution. [5] This study analyzes how the political and social interests underlying accounts of the Iraq/Saudi Arabia projected event were rhetorically managed in The New York Times (NYT) and Washington Post (WP). [6] Although numerous studies (Bruck, 1989; Clayman, 1990; Fairclough, 1992c; Fowler, 1991; Fowler and Kress 1979a; Glasgow University Media Group, 1976, 1980; Hall, 1978, 1982; Hodge, 1979; Tuchman, 1978; Van

Dijk, 1988, 1989, 1993; Zelizer, 1989) have identified sourcing (i.e., using spokespersons representing so-called elite groups and institutions as sources for information) as a constructive social and ideological practice, little analytic attention has been paid to the implications of this finding for how texts are linguistically constructed within newspaper discourse, a discourse context guided by the professional canon of objectivity, balance and neutrality. [7] I address this issue by demonstrating how assertions about a hypothetical future event attributed to a specific group of spokespersons were transformed into unmediated and presupposed information.

(Dunsmire, 1997: 222–3)

Typically, we ask a number of questions to guide analysis of such articles, including:

How does the writer align herself with certain scholars or bodies of work?   
How does she show where she belongs?   
How does she create a gap to insert her work?

In the Dunsmire text, we can see that sentence 1 locates her analysis within critical linguistics, the place where her work belongs. She signals a gap by pointing out what other researchers have not done in sentences 2 and 6. And she signals the contribution her study will make to the field in sentences 3 and 7: ‘As such, this study provides additional insight’; ‘I address this issue by demonstrating how’.

But this is only one kind of textual locating. The conventions used depend on the purposes of the LR as well as the discipline. Our second example is a pithy excerpt from the introduction to Jones’ (2003) book Education in Britain: 1944 to the Present. We like it because it shows in a short space the kind of textwork more experienced scholars use to create a warrant for their work in the broader field of scholarship.

[1] The book differs from other accounts of the post-war period. [2] It owes a factual and interpretative debt, as any writer in this area must, to Brian Simon’s Education and the Social Order (1991), to Richard Johnson and his colleagues at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (1981; Johnson 1989), to McPherson and Raab’s Governing Education (1988), and to the work of Gareth Elwyn Jones on Wales (1990, 1997) and of several writers including Sean Farren and Penny McKeown, on Northern Ireland. [3] In other respects it has benefited from the consciously gendered history presented by Arnot et al (1999), and from Iain Grosvenor’s treatment of race, identity and nation (1997). [4] In these writings it is possible to find descriptions and analyses of national or ‘sectoral’ histories of schooling whose detail this book does not intend to match. [5] What it rather does, I hope, is to present a broader perspective on educational change than is usually managed, with a more consistently maintained cultural dimension, a greater attention to political conflict, a fuller sense of the range of social actors involved in policy, practice and the educational space, within a framework which conveys something of the varying national experience of schooling in Britain. [6] If it is successful in these respects then much is owed to the educational activists with whom I have worked in the past, and to my present colleagues on the journal Education and Social Justice, whose pages are much referenced in my final chapter.

(Jones 2003: 2)

Again, it is useful to ask questions of the text. These focus the reader on the strategies and conventions used, not just the content:

How does the writer acknowledge the work of other scholars? How does he distinguish his contribution to the field?

Jones provides a fine example of the appreciative stance to others’ scholarship we discussed in Chapter 3. This is a criticality which is respectful of what others have done. Sentence 1 distinguishes Jones’ contribution right from the start, for example, through the use of the verb ‘differs’. In sentences 2 and 3 he uses verbs such as ‘owes’ and ‘benefited’ to show the writer’s debt to previous scholarship. Sentence 5 uses a number of comparative terms: ‘a broader perspective . . . with a more consistently maintained . . . a greater attention to . . . a fuller sense of’, to further mark the book’s distinctiveness. The generosity expressed in sentence 6 is not a cover for false modesty and humility but enhances the writer’s authority, rather than diminishes it.

Working with these kind of LR samples creates a context for discussing how doctoral writers might create space for their own scholarship. It is text-specific work which makes explicit how more expert writers operate.

But we can go further and more directly intervene in our students’ writing. Rather than use an old-fashioned ‘bring out the red pen’ approach, we suggest collaborative textwork, where supervisors and doctoral researchers write together to develop a ‘hands on hips’ textual authority.

# Writing side by side

Modelling and deconstructing text is not always enough. In this strategy supervisors work side by side with doctoral researchers at the computer to revise draft LRs. Remaking text and manipulating it until it speaks more assertively is more tangible. It makes the process of knowledge production ‘hands on’. The supervisor takes the lead in this strategy and models revision-in-action, often with powerful effects on doctoral researcher identities.

To illustrate, we consider an interaction between doctoral researcher Mia and her supervisor Andrew. Mia is reviewing literatures for her dissertation proposal. She has summarized trends in the field of homework research as a foundation for her own qualitative study on the effects of homework on families in diverse sociocultural contexts. Like Dunsmire, Mia consolidates a large number of studies into a short space. Like Vera, whose LR we considered in Chapter 3, Mia adopts a ‘he said, she said’ strategy (see DW 4.1), starting most sentences by naming previous studies and reviewers of homework. We highlight this pattern in italics and number her sentences to facilitate analysis of the text.

[1] All reviewers of the homework literature agree that much research into homework has been poorly designed, short term, experimental and narrowly focused on academic achievement (Cooper, 1989; Coulter, 1979; Paschal, 1984). [2] Further, studies have been premised on partial or commonsense definitions which either assume an understanding of homework or narrowly define homework as time spent in completion of school assignments (HooverDempsey, 1995). [3] Many studies have been based on self-reported quantitative data alone; such data is inevitably limited in its potential to provide insights into the relationship between homework and achievement.

[4] Several scholars who have reviewed the academic literature on homework (Hoover-Dempsey, 1995; Coulter, 1979) suggest that the equivocal nature of the findings into the effects of homework, despite a century of research, reveals more about the methodological challenges of researching this complex subject than can be stated conclusively about the relationship between homework and achievement. [5] Apart from the quantitative studies previously discussed, many studies have used evidence from interviews with children, parents and teachers. [6] There has also been little research evidence derived from classrooms which explores teachers’ framing of homework or children’s understandings of their tasks. [7] Further, the majority of studies have concentrated on homework practices of adolescent secondary students. [8] Scholars who have reviewed the academic literature on homework (Hoover-Dempsey, 1995) have directed little research attention to primary school students’ homework, with the exception of the role of parents in the development of child literacy. [9] Few observational studies have examined the webs of social interaction between children and their parents, siblings, friends and schools within which homework is constructed (Coulter, 1979: 27). [10] A few influential studies have looked at the family interactions around homework in diverse socio-cultural contexts (Breen et al, 1994; Freebody et al, 1995; Lareau, 1987) and will be discussed in a later section of this review.

Doctoral writing 4.1 Mia’s LR’.

There is nothing ‘wrong’ with Mia’s writing in terms of fluency, syntax or clarity. Andrew was concerned, however, that she was absent from the text. She succinctly summarizes the equivocal findings of the homework research, but her own opinions and evaluations are backgrounded or attributed to other researchers. As a result, a critical and authoritative stance is missing in her writing.

To interrupt this way of writing, Andrew began the supervision session with Mia’s text displayed on the computer screen. His aim was to model how Mia might foreground her own point of view. It is important that this textwork occurred in Mia’s presence, rather than as red-pen correction in her absence. This made her part of the process. Andrew talked out loud about what he was attempting. He was tentative and playful, trying things on the screen and rejecting them. Mia, in turn, was both witness and participant, making suggestions and seeing the text change before her eyes. The interaction was punctuated by Andrew asking Mia questions about the text.

His first move was to show Mia how she attributed everything (every idea, trend, opinion) to other researchers. So, for example, in sentence 1 Mia begins, ‘All reviewers of the homework literature agree.’ He asked whether Mia also agreed with this idea. When she said yes, he shifted her sentence structure so that the assertion came first, and the citation last.

In sum, it appears that much research into homework has been poorly designed, short term, experimental and narrowly focused on academic achievement. (Cooper, 1989; Coulter, 1979; Paschal, 1984)

This is a subtle shift, but one that lets Mia take a stand in this community of scholars, rather than exclude herself. Andrew used a similar strategy in the second paragraph. He looked, for example, at sentence 4 where Mia begins: ‘Several scholars who have reviewed the academic literature on homework suggest’. He shifted the pattern of attribution to the end of the sentence and allowed Mia’s claim to come first.

It seems, then, that despite a century of research, the equivocal nature of the findings says more about the methodological challenges of researching this complex subject than about any definitive relationship between homework and achievement itself. (Hoover-Dempsey, 1995; Coulter, 1979)

His next move was to create a third paragraph, missing altogether from the first draft, where Mia might highlight the gap her own research was addressing. He looked, in particular, at sentence 10, where she refers to ‘A few influential studies’ without making any link to her own work. He asked: What is the link between this work and what you will do? How do you plan to use these influential studies?

On the basis of this conversation, he added phrases and sentences, asking: What will you say here? How do we mark your contribution? Gradually he inserted Mia’s words, acting as her scribe and co-text worker. This conversation provided a scaffold for Mia to learn conventions for staking a claim. Mia worked with Andrew to make textual connections between her work and the wider scholarly community. Her revised LR (see DW 4.2) constructs a more authoritative stance for Mia as doctoral researcher. We use italics to highlight the new pattern at the beginning of sentences and the change in writer stance it achieves.

[1] In sum, it appears that much research into homework has been poorly designed, short term, experimental and narrowly focused on academic achievement (Cooper, 1989; Coulter, 1979; Paschal, 1984). [2] Studies have been premised on partial or commonsense definitions which either assume an understanding of homework or narrowly define homework as time spent in completion of school assignments (Hoover-Dempsey, 1995). [3] The over- reliance on self-reported quantitative data alone has led to limited insights into the relationship between homework and achievement.

[4] It seems, then, that despite a century of research, the equivocal nature of the findings says more about the methodological challenges of researching this complex subject than about any definitive relationship between homework and achievement itself (Hoover-Dempsey, 1995; Coulter, 1979). [5] The qualitative research evidence to date has relied heavily on interviews with children, parents and teachers, that is, on what people say they do. [6] There has been little attention given to the practice of school homework as it occurs in the family context. [7] There has been little classroom-based research evidence which explores teachers’ framing of homework or children’s understandings of their tasks. [8] Further, little research attention has focused on primary school students’ homework, with the exception of the role of parents in the development of child literacy.

[9] In this proposal I attempt to address these methodological gaps by designing an observational and interview-based study which examines the webs of social interaction between children and their parents, siblings, friends and schools within which homework is constructed (Coulter, 1979: 27). [10] I focus on the primary secondary school nexus and work with a more complex understanding of homework as a social practice. [11] A number of influential studies which have examined family interactions around homework in diverse socio-cultural contexts (Breen, 1994; Freebody, 1995; Hill, 2002) provide a foundation for my study and will be discussed in Section 3.3 of this review.

Doctoral writing 4.2 Mia’s revised LR.

Mia now takes a ‘critical’ stance. She incorporates evaluative comments at the start of sentences, for example, ‘The over- reliance on self-reported quantitative data alone has led to limited insights’ (3). She identifies gaps: ‘There has been little attention given to’ (6); ‘There has been little classroom-based research’ (7); ‘Further, little research attention has focused on’ (8). And like Jones, she acknowledges her debt to previous scholarship: ‘A number of influential studies . . provide a foundation for my study’ (11).

The outcome is a more assertive, less descriptive text. Mia was not only pleased with the revision, but astounded at how little it took to make her sound more authoritative. This side-by-side writing with Andrew affected her deeply and almost seemed to be written into her body as she left the supervision seemingly taller. She spoke later of the session as a pivotal event in helping her ‘get how to become critical’. The identitywork was profound.

As supervisor and student remade the text together, they also remade Mia’s understanding of how to build the kind of textual authority she desired, but was unable to create on her own – particularly at this early stage of her candidature. There was also something pleasurable about the sociality of writing together. It created a different position for the doctoral researcher; she was a collaborator, working with her supervisor to strengthen the text.

# Sentence skeletons

It is useful to ‘borrow’ the words of others to help students learn new ways of speaking that may seem foreign or intimidating. We draw on Swales and Feak’s (1994) notion of the ‘sentence skeleton’. The aim is to make explicit the linguistic patterns in any passage of research writing by removing the content and identifying the skeleton of rhetorical moves. To illustrate, we represent the skeleton of rhetorical moves from the Dunsmire excerpt we looked at earlier.

Supervisors might ask doctoral students to write about their own research using this sentence skeleton. The skeleton creates a linguistic frame to play with. It encourages writers to take the stance of an experienced writer – at least linguistically. It allows them to write themselves into an authoritative stance they may not be able to take by themselves. The syntactic framework scaffolds linguistic identitywork. Doctoral writers take up ways of asserting and staking a claim in their field, and they make these linguistic tactics their own.

Doctoral researchers can discuss this syntactic strategy with supervisors and/or in small groups with peers. This is not plagiarism as they are not copying content. Rather it helps them get inside the patterning of language and makes explicit how others write LRs in particular fields of inquiry.

The strategy can be adapted to a wide variety of scholarly articles across disciplines to make explicit discipline-specific conventions. So, for example, we can make the same kind of skeleton frame from the Jones excerpt, making a few modifications from book to thesis.

3 In other respects it has benefited from the presented by and from ’s treatment of ( ).

5 What it rather does is to present a broader perspective on than is usually managed, with a more consistently maintained a greater attention to _, a fuller sense of the range of within a framework which conveys   
6 If it is successful in these respects, then much is owed to

We suggested earlier that the Jones passage was powerful in modelling how to make a warrant for one’s research. When we also use it as a frame for doctoral writing, we take the modelling a step further. Students rarely end up using the skeleton in their writing. It’s a practice which builds text and identity, a way to write themselves into more authoritative ways of speaking. Given our assertion that the LR is the quintessential site of identitywork, such strategies are useful for supervisors who mediate the doctoral struggle to become critical and decisive.

# In sum

This chapter has focused on the reading and writing involved in literature work. The LR is a key place where doctoral researchers come unstuck. They can’t find space for themselves and feel crowded out by experts in the field. They get lost in the sheer volume of material they have to digest and have few productive strategies for systematically organizing and then defending what they’ve done. We have offered supervisory strategies for scanning, noting and writing the LR which accomplish significant textwork and identitywork. This involves supervisors taking on a hands-on coaching approach. They put away their red pens in favour of more collaborative work on texts.
