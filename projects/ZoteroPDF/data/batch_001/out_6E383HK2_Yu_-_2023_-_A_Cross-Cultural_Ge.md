# A Cross-Cultural Genre Analysis of Leadership Statements in Italian and American University Sustainability Reports

DANNI YU

Abstract—Background: Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue in higher education (HE). Leadership statements in university sustainability reports (LSUSR) represent a unique genre for university leaders to communicate sustainability. This study aims to demystify the genre so that future leadership statements might be crafted with a greater degree of reflexivity. Literature review: Sustainability discourse in HE has been regarded as a legitimacy tool and an opportunity for image improvement for universities. Some studies have examined university sustainability reports, whereas there is a lack of studies focusing on the section of leadership statements. Research question: Are there any cross-cultural similarities or differences in terms of rhetorical moves and communicative purposes between the Italian LSUSR genre and the American LSUSR genre? Research methodology: Using cross-cultural genre analysis, this study investigates the rhetorical moves of leadership statements produced by Italian and American universities. A move scheme is established and is used to annotate the sample texts. Results and conclusion: The findings show that although the Italian and American LSUSR genres share the communicative purpose of establishing a sustainable image, the degree of discourse force exerting on this communicative purpose varies. The image-building discourse force appears to be more noticeable in the American leadership statements, which tend to use a wider range and a larger quantity of image-improving moves. The Italian subcorpus, on the other hand, seems to pay more attention to the genre function of report-introducing, which is not explicitly linked to image improvement. This article suggests that practitioners could consider the potentials of the LSUSR genre in developing an institutional culture of sustainability.

n recent decades, universities have assumed a privileged position as key drivers of education for a sustainable future [1], [2]. The term sustainability was defined by the United Nations Brundtland Commission in 1987 as “meet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” [3, p. 41]. This definition is probably the most widely accepted in the field of higher education (HE) [4, p. 23]. Given that society is increasingly sensitive about sustainability in HE [5], [6], more and more universities are engaged in sustainability reporting (SR) to satisfy the informational demands of stakeholders (e.g., potential and current students, parents, funding bodies, government departments, alumni, academics, and staff) [7].

This growing concern about SR in HE is also noted in academic literature. In recent years, a significant number of studies have investigated SR by universities [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Several studies have focused on the general contents of sustainability reports [6], [11], [15], but we are not aware of any studies that focus specifically on the section pertaining to leadership statements. Social reports and sustainability reports represent the most widespread voluntary nonfinancial reporting tools for universities. For the sake of simplicity, we will hereafter use the term “sustainability report” to refer to social and sustainability reports.

Leadership statements are typically endorsed by a senior decision maker of the institution and appear in the initial section of the sustainability report. They are important sections that signal leadership engagement in sustainability. In terms of sustainable development in HE, leadership engagement plays a crucial role. For example, in 1990, university leaders from around the world created the Talloires Declaration with the aim of defining and promoting sustainability in HE. SR is one area where university leaders can make significant contributions. On the one hand, university leaders acting in accordance with the demands of society can support sustainability

Using cross-cultural genre analysis, this study. investigates the rhetorical moves of leadership statements in university sustainability reports (LsUSR produced by Italian and American universities..

Results The findings show that although the Italian and American LsusR genres share the communicative purpose of establishing a sustainable image, the degree of discourse force exerting on this communicative purpose varies.

initiatives, such as sustainability assessment and reporting [18]. On the other, university leaders play an essential role in infusing sustainability into university culture [13].

The leadership statement in the university sustainability report (LSUSR) represents a unique opportunity for university leaders to communicate the value of sustainability and, thus, establish a stronger sustainability culture for the institution, which underlines the importance of examining the genre of leadership statements. Both university leaders and communication professionals of a university, who may be engaged in the preparation of leadership statements, need to be aware of the significance of the genre and to understand better its rhetorical composition. This is the area to which our article seeks to contribute.

The extensiveness of the 10 moves

This article examines how the emerging genre of the LSUSR is developing in both the Italian and the American contexts, with the aim of demystifying the genre so that future leadership statements might be crafted with a greater degree of reflexivity. To achieve this goal, this article uses the approach of cross-cultural genre analysis (CCGA) [19] and examines the rhetorical structures of leadership statements to provide insights into the communicative purposes embedded in the genre. The unit of analysis of the discourses is the rhetorical move, a text segment performing a

specific communicative function that appears recursively in a genre. The rhetorical moves constitute the rhetorical structure of a genre. Genre analysis [20], [21] sheds light on the communicative purposes of a genre by deconstructing it, and has been widely used in professional communication studies (e.g., [22], [23], [24]).

The cross-cultural approach has two objectives. First, it uncovers cross-cultural convergence in the rhetorical realizations of the genre, which can shed light on its unchanging nature across various cultures. The second objective is to reveal genre diversity (i.e., the different ways in which a genre is performed by different discourse communities). The various performances of a genre are related to the understanding of the genre and the subject matter that it addresses. The investigation of genre diversity in sustainability communication is useful in understanding how sustainability, as a global concern, or sustainability-related events are dealt with and perceived in different cultural contexts. This study investigates the diversity of the LSUSR genre produced in the US and Italy, where SR in HE is gaining increasing attention. These two countries are characterized by different HE traditions and have different genre guidelines for the practice of SR. These contextual differences might bring about different understandings of sustainability communication, which might be instantiated by diverse genre performances.

# Practitioner Takeaway

Two main rhetorical moves in Leadership Statements in University Sustainability Reports (LSUsRs) are "Showing commitment to sustainability" and "Introducing the report'. In a cross-cultural perspective, Italian LSUsRs spend considerably more textual space on the strategy of report-introducing. American LSUsRs, on the other hand, pay more attention to the establishment of an image of the sustainable university, by using more extensively rhetorical moves such as "Reporting sustainability performance," "Assessing sustainability performance,' and "Showing sustainability-related competence.". When deciding which rhetorical strategy to prioritize, practitioners could consider the status of the targeted reader and goals of the communication. One important goal is the development of a university sustainability culture, in which university leaders play an essential role.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. First, the relevant literature on leadership statements in SR is introduced. The next section provides contextual information regarding SR in the Italian and American contexts, in order to help understand the genre under investigation. This is followed by a presentation of the theoretical framework and the corpus and methodology. The findings begin with a description of generic features shared by the Italian and American leadership statements, and then present the main genre differences. Subsequently, this article discusses these cross-cultural similarities and differences in light of contextual constraints. The closing section summarizes the findings, predicts practical implications, indicates the limitations of this study, and offers suggestions for future research.

Leadership Statements in Sustainability Reporting (SR) The leadership statement (often called the “CEO letter” in the traditional business financial report) is a high-stakes piece of communication and has been extensively studied [25]. As a signed personal statement, this genre has considerable rhetorical importance in building credibility [26] and is widely considered a promotional genre used to convey a corporate image to stakeholders [27]. In the nonfinancial domain, the CEO statement in corporate sustainability reports is also viewed as a rhetorical tool for corporate communication [22], [28], [29], [30]. Mäkelä and Laine [30] noticed that the CEO statements in both sustainability and financial reports serve the same purpose of strengthening a particular worldview of the company.

Castelló and Lozano [29] consider the CEO statement an expression of legitimacy and identify three types of rhetoric: strategic (embedded in the scientific-economic paradigm, institutional (based on the fundamental constructs of Corporate Social Responsibility theories), and dialectic (which aims at improving the discursive quality between corporations and their stakeholders). Moreover, they mention that although usually drafted by consultants, CEO letters are often read carefully by CEOs to ensure that they convey the firm’s image and put across their main messages [29, p. 15]. Barkemeyer et al.’s [28] study suggests that the rhetoric in CEO statements in sustainability reports is more indicative of impression management than representing accountability for sustainability performance.

# LITERATURE REVIEW

The aforementioned studies have focused on business settings, where increasing profits have always been the primary goal, and the sustainability discourse is seen as a rhetorical tool to improve corporate reputation and to increase corporate profits [31], [32]. In the field of HE, sustainability discourse has also been examined with a critical eye. Sylvestre et al. [33] investigate the textual devices used in declarations on sustainability in HE and notice the emergence of textual devices that work to (re)produce the neoliberal market ideology. Sustainability is regarded as a legitimate tool [16], [34] and an opportunity for image improvement [13] for universities that are traditionally not-for-profit institutions. However, given the educational purpose of HE for human and social development, sustainability discourse should also be seen in the light of the promotion of sustainability culture and education for development, a perspective that is also considered in this study, alongside the marketing elements.

The leadership statement takes a conspicuous position in the university sustainability report. It is an important tool for university leaders to communicate to stakeholders not only about sustainability-related performance but also about the sustainability culture of the university. It contributes to establishing and reinforcing the sustainable image of the university which can positively influence the impression of the university among internal and external stakeholders. The leadership statement constitutes discursive leadership, which views leadership as “a process of influence and meaning management” [35, p. 511], in which communication participants enact leadership behavior by “influencing others and defining/explaining practices or policies within the organizational context” [36, p. 313].

Our particular focus is to demystify the rhetoric of the LSUSR genre by investigating how it is rhetorically constructed to achieve specific communicative purposes from a cross-cultural perspective. However, as there are no studies that we are aware of that examine the generic structure of leadership statements in university sustainability reports, we consider several studies that have investigated the generic structure of CEO statements in corporate sustainability reports [23], [37], [38]. Catenaccio [23], for example, suggests that the rhetorical move focusing on performance is a key move of the genre of CEO statements in corporate sustainability reports. This generic feature is also present in CEO statements produced by different cultural communities [37], [38]. Similarly, Barkemeyer et al. [28] note that one purpose of CEO statements in sustainability reports is to give an overview of the company’s performance. However, this internationally standardized discourse feature may not be found in HE, where SR is still in its early stage and may demonstrate a higher degree of discourse diversity.

HE SR in Italy and in the US An investigation of the genre contexts is useful to understand the LSUSR genre. In the Italian context, HE faces challenges, such as a significant reduction in public funding and a growing societal demand for accountability and transparency [11]. The reforming process that has taken place in Italian HE has called for SR in order to reinforce accountability and transparency related to the activities and results to which the funding system is linked [15], [39]. A series of institutional interventions has been taken to encourage SR in HE. The main interventions include the Directive on Social Reporting in the Public Sector of the

![](img/2af7c96c429a0e59b8b31613da6547d3d2b6c9f681c3119d9382155f24cf1f0d.jpg)  
Fig. 1. The number of sustainability reports published by 67 Italian public universities and 67 American public universities (selected according to QS 2020) from 2001 to 2020. (In the US, there are 2050 public universities. The 67 American public universities under investigation are the first-ranked universities according to the QS world university rankings 2020. More details can be found in the method section.)

Italian Minister of Public Affairs in 2006 (the Directive) [40], the Document on Social Reporting in Universities, developed by the National Study Group on Social Reporting (the Document) [41], and the establishment in 2015 of a network of universities for sustainable development (RUS—Rete delle Università per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile) [11].

In this study, for example, all of the Italian universities under investigation are members of the RUS, which is committed to strengthening social responsibility and environmental sustainability. Given this focus, the number of sustainability reports published by Italian universities has seen noticeable growth in recent years. This trend was noticed when we collected materials for this study. The number of sustainability reports available on the websites of all 67 Italian state universities has continued to increase over the last two decades, as can be seen in Fig. 1. Italy has 67 state universities in total. We have investigated the official websites of all the state universities to see whether they publish sustainability reports.

In the US, sustainability is proving to be fundamental to universities remaining competitive [42]. As in Italy, the US HE sector is also characterized by an increasing number of sustainability reports. As shown in Fig. 1, the number of reports published by the 67 American public universities has also increased. The growth of SR in the US is related to a steadily increasing number of initiatives undertaken to promote

sustainability in the HE sector. Prominent initiatives include the Campus Climate Challenge coordinated by the Energy Action Coalition, the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), the College Sustainability Report Card, RecycleMania, Tree Campus, and the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in HE (AASHE) [43]. In particular, the AASHE has initiated the program of Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS), which is a transparent, self-reporting framework for universities to measure their sustainability performance. The guide to STARS credits and reporting requirements was published in June 2019 in the STARS Technical Manual 2.2 [44]. In the US, STARS reporting is often the starting point for universities to create sustainability reports [6]. By February 2022, 1079 institutions had registered to use the STARS Reporting Tool.

HE institutions from different cultural backgrounds may use different guidelines for structuring the content of sustainability reports. The Directive and the Document, which were mentioned above as two institutional interventions used in Italy to support HE reporting, provide some guidelines on the structure and content of sustainability reports for Italian universities. For example, the Document suggests five sections to be included in the sustainability report:

Introduction and methodological note   
University identity   
Reclassification of financial data   
Social relations   
Future goals

However, as noted by Siboni et al.’s [15] study, Italian guidelines for SR have had a limited impact on the content of reports. It seems that the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) guidelines are more commonly used, as eight out of the nine Italian sustainability reports investigated in this study use the GRI parameters, while only one report mentions the use of the Directive and the Document. The nine US universities investigated in this study, on the other hand, do not mention the use of GRI standards. Although they do not present explicit indications of the reporting parameters, their reporting practice may be widely influenced by STARS reporting parameters because they are all STARS participants.

The GRI standards and the STARS reporting requirements are different in several aspects. In particular, STARS has a stronger environmental focus but requires much less coverage of other issues than the GRI standards. Moreover, STARS refers only marginally to social topics, which are among the key concerns of the GRI guidelines [6]. As Sassen and Azziz’s [6] study notes, American SR shows a clear focus on the environmental dimension, while rarely addressing the social dimension. The influence of STARS can also be found in the sample used in this study. Although the GRI standards require a statement from the most senior decision maker of the institution, the STARS Technical Manual requires a letter from the institution’s president, chancellor, or other high-ranking executive [44, p. 2]. This can explain why most of the American leadership statements examined in this study are signed by high-ranking executives from a specific department or office (e.g., Director of the Center for the Environment; Executive Director of the Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability and Risk; Dean of the College of the Environment), while all of the Italian leadership statements are endorsed by university presidents.

Moreover, the broader context of HE can also influence the genre. Marketization is one remarkable aspect of American public HE, a phenomenon shaped by neoliberal ideas and practices developed in the US throughout the past four decades [45]. Italian universities, on the other hand, tend to be relatively reluctant to adapt to global market forces, and the mode of communication is still not widely influenced by market logic [46, p. 378]. The different degree of attention paid to market forces in HE may influence how universities make use of promotiona discourse in the LSUSR genre.

Theoretical Framework Genre analysis is a useful approach in understanding a specific genre. Having evolved over 35 years, genre research has seen developments on a global scale. The genre traditions that are widely recognized among genre analysts [46], [47], [48] are the British English for Specific Purpose (ESP) school [20], [21]; the Australian Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) school [49], [50], [51]; and the American New Rhetoric school [51], [52]. More recent trends include the Geneva Socio-Discursive Interactionalism school [53], [54] and Brazilian critical genre analysis [55]. This study draws mainly on works developed by the British ESP school.

The ESP approach of genre analysis was pioneered by John Swales [20], [56]. In his seminal book

Genre Analysis: English in Academic and Research Settings [20], Swales proposed the method of move analysis to describe the rhetorical structures of academic genres for pedagogical needs in L2 writing. Subsequently, Bhatia extended it to investigate professional genres providing a hands-on approach to put theory into practice [21]. The practicality of move analysis has then triggered large numbers of studies of various genres, in both academic and professional contexts.

In the last 20 years, move analysis has continued to be enriched with new methods, theories, approaches, concepts, and perspectives. To mention only a few, Biber et al. [57] proposed a corpus-based approach to investigate discourse structure. Moreno and Swales [58] noted the possibility of the semiautomatic coding of moves by using well-defined annotations to train corpus tools such as AntMover [59]. Wang and Flowerdew [60] experimented with the method of participatory genre analysis, in which the researcher acts as a participant observer to help student writing, using move analysis. Devitt [61] proposed the concept of unique “genre performance” where individuals may improvise moves for particular needs. Vergaro [62] has shown the utility of the entrenchment-andconventionalization model [63] in understanding the complex nature of genre from a cognitive perspective. These studies nourished genre theories, exploiting the value of the genre perspective in discourse studies.

Move analysis, though initially intended to be applied in ESP teaching and learning [49, p. 3], has also been extended to investigate genres produced in different languages using a cross-cultural perspective [64], [65], [66], [67]. Studies in this direction can be defined as CCGA. Yu [19] discussed the theoretical issues of CCGA and proposed a methodological framework, in which comparative move analysis constitutes a core analytical procedure.

This study adopts the perspective of CCGA [19], which aims to investigate how discourse communities from different cultural backgrounds use language in a particular genre to achieve certain communicative purposes [19, p. 13]. Drawing on the ESP tradition of genre analysis [20], [21], the CCGA approach views genre as $^ { 6 } \mathrm { a }$ class of communicative events, the members of which share some set of communicative purposes” [20, p. 58]. “Communicative purposes” is a crucial concept in ESP genre analysis, as well as in the

CCGA approach. A specific genre may possess similar communicative purposes across different cultural contexts, but may also be characterized by some specific communicative purposes, since the context varies. These essential similarities or differences are often reflected by the rhetorical choices used in the genre-texts (i.e., texts that belong to the specific genre under investigation).

In this study, one particular notion used to understand cross-cultural variations in terms of communicative purpose is discourse force, which refers to the quantity and intensity of discourse strategies that can contribute to realizing a specific communicative purpose. When a genre uses a significant number of discourse strategies that function explicitly in realizing a communicative purpose, we can say that the discourse force used to achieve the communicative purpose is strong, as many resources have been used in communicating this purpose. When a genre uses a small number of discourse strategies to realize a communicative purpose, then we can say that the communicative purpose exists in the genre but the discourse force used to realize it is weak.

Three factors can be considered when measuring the discourse force directed to a specific purpose: the variety of relevant move types, their frequency, and their extensiveness. The notion of extensiveness is related to the length of a move type. Although extensiveness has been rarely dealt with in previous studies using move analysis, it is regarded as one key indicator in CCGA since it can signal the textual “weight” and, thus, the rhetorical importance of a move in genre-texts produced by different cultural communities [19, p. 43].

# RESEARCH QUESTIONS

Building on the work of Swales [20] and Bhatia [21], we used the approach of CCGA [19] to explore how the emerging genre of LSUSR is developed in the Italian and American contexts, with the aim of demystifying the genre so that future leadership statements might be constructed with a greater degree of reflexivity. The following research questions are addressed in the present study.

RQ1. What rhetorical moves are used in the Italian LSUSR genre and the American LSUSR genre for sustainability communication?

RQ2. Are there any cross-cultural similarities or differences in the use of these rhetorical moves?

RQ3. Does the use of these rhetorical moves reflect similarities or differences in terms of communicative purpose(s)?

# METHODOLOGY

Corpus The data for this study come from a corpus of 18 leadership statements in 18 sustainability reports published by nine Italian public universities and nine American public universities between 2017 and 2019. The corpus is composed of two subcorpora: the Italian LSUSR subcorpus and the American LSUSR subcorpus. The material selection is based on a contextual investigation of HE SR in Italy and in the US. Considerations for the material selection include the following.

1. The contextual analysis reveals that the LSUSR genre produced in the Pre-COVID-19 era differs quite noticeably in terms of content and structure from that of the Post-COVID-19 era. This study is focused on the analysis of sustainability reports published during the period of 2017-2019 (i.e., a period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic).

2. According to data published by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), Italy has 67 public universities and 31 private universities. By investigating the official websites of all the Italian universities (November 2021), we found that downloadable sustainability reports were available on the websites of 33 public universities and only three private universities. Therefore, to maximize the quantity of materials to be investigated, we examined the sustainability reports published by public universities.

3. In the US, there are 2050 public universities. To ensure data comparability, we considered 67 American public universities and 67 Italian public universities. The 67 American public universities are the top-ranked universities, according to the QS World University Rankings 2020. Furthermore, the investigation of the official websites of these universities revealed that 30 of these 67 American public universities published at least one sustainability report during the period of 2017-2019, of which only nine published reports containing leadership statements. In the case of Italy, 26 Italian public universities published at least one sustainability report during the period of 2017–2019, among which 15 universities published reports containing leadership statements. To ensure

comparability, we selected nine sustainability reports containing leadership statements published by nine Italian public universities ranking the highest according to QS 2020. A list of the selected sustainability reports can be found in the Appendix. The QS rankings are based on a university’s research reputation, learning and teaching environment, research impact, and internationalization. Although the rankings do not directly consider the universities’ sustainability performance, they do reflect their overall strength, which, to some extent, is related to their impact on society’s perception of sustainability. This study attempts to examine how universities with considerable social influence deal with the topic of sustainability and make use of the LSUSR genre. A further examination reveals that all the American universities selected are STARS participants, and all the Italian universities under investigation are members of the RUS, which indicates their commitment to sustainability.

Methods This study uses the method of comparative move analysis, which includes three main stages: 1. move identification, that is, identifying the main move types of the genre to establish a move scheme; 2. move annotation, that is, annotating the texts with the identified moves; 3. move comparison, that is, investigating how moves are distributed and realized in the genre-texts produced by the two different cultures. These analytical stages will be presented in greater detail in the following pages.

Move Identification: The identification of rhetorical moves of a genre is a core stage in move analysis. One essential goal of this stage is to identify moves that can to some extent reveal the communicative functions and purposes of the genre to shed light on the genre’s nature. In this stage, first of all, the researcher should determine the basic or normal textual boundary of a move, which “may vary in size from a clause to a paragraph or upwards” [48, p. 168]. The move size depends mainly on what level of detail the researcher would like to conduct the analysis and can also be constrained by the length of a text that belongs to this genre. In this study of the LSUSR genre, which is often characterized by moderate textual length, the identification of moves was based on the sentence level (rather than, e.g., the paragraph). In other words, every sentence was examined in terms of its rhetorical function to determine to which move type it belongs.

Another key issue of this stage is to determine the factors to be considered in the identification of rhetorical functions. In this study, both the formal realizations (linguistic and nonlinguistic realizations) and metafunctions (i.e., textual, interpersonal, and ideational metafunctions) of each sentence [64] were considered. The concepts of ideational, interpersonal, and textual metafunctions are drawn from Halliday’s [68] theory of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and were originally used to classify the metafunctions of language. These concepts are found to be useful in analyzing texts on the discourse level and, in particular, in analyzing and denominating the rhetorical functions of a textual unit [65, pp. 278–280].

In the context of discourse analysis, the three metafunctions are defined as follows: the ideational metafunction is used to provide content-related information; the interpersonal metafunction serves to establish a certain kind of interpersonal relationships; the textual metafunction serves to connect different discourse elements to smooth the discourse process and integrate the genre. Although a rhetorical unit can be characterized by overlapping ideational, interpersonal, and textual metafunctions, one of the metafunctions may be more noticeable or explicit than the others.

The moves of the LSUSR genre were identified and denominated according to the explicit metafunction. For example, the move “Reporting sustainability performance” (see Table I) is used explicitly to provide performance information; therefore, it is named according to its ideational metafunction instead of its interpersonal metafunction (e.g., “Convincing the reader to believe that the university is doing well in terms of sustainability by presenting performance details”) or its textual metafunction (e.g., “Elaborating a proposition by presenting further details”).

By manually analyzing all the texts in the corpus considering the above factors, a move scheme with 10 move types was established. Table I shows the move scheme presenting the name, definition, and examples of each move type.

Move Annotation: On the basis of the move scheme, all the texts were then annotated using NoteTab Light. An annotated sample can be found in the Appendix. In the reliability check, another coder was involved to independently annotate four sample texts with the aid of the move scheme (see Table I). The overall agreement rate reached $9 4 \%$ , indicating that the descriptions of move types are sufficiently clear and that the consensus among coders is high. The inconsistencies were often related to the overlapping functions of a move instance and the different understanding of particular words. For example, the sentence “Our initiatives are creating a more efficiently-run campus, fostering ground-breaking research [ …]” was annotated as “Previewing future performance” by one coder, but as “Assessing sustainability performance” by the other coder. The different choices were related to the understanding of the present progressive tense (e.g., are creating): the first coder focused more on its function of future indication, while the second coder paid more attention to the actions in progress.

Move Comparison: The coded corpus was then analyzed with WordSmith 7.0 to get essential data information for move comparison, which was done on two levels. The first level focused on move distribution, considering the extensiveness and the frequency of each move type in each subcorpus. Extensiveness refers to the number of words used to make the move, compared with the length of the text set under investigation, expressed by a percentage. It signals the textual weight of a move. Frequency refers to the number of texts in which a move appears, reflecting to what extent a move is conventionally used. The distribution (i.e., extensiveness and frequency) of a move signals the textual importance of the move and, thus, signals the significance of the communicative purpose embedded in the move. Furthermore, Loglikelihood and Chi-square Calculator 1.0, a software developed by Beijing Foreign Studies University, was used to conduct log-likelihood tests on the significance of the difference between the two samples in terms of the extensiveness of moves.

The second level of move comparison qualitatively analyzed a specific move to identify groups of words with similar connotations that symbolize specific themes or concepts. The identified themes can then shed light on the focus of institutional attention. In this study, the move “Showing commitment to sustainability” was analyzed with NVivo 12, which was used to gather all the move instances together in one place and then to identify “nodes” that represent specific themes for coding.

# RESULTS

As anticipated in the previous section, a move scheme of the LSUSR genre was identified (see Table I), in response to the first research question. This section presents first a rhetorical move that is commonly used by both the Italian and American discourse communities and then specific moves that characterize the two subcorpora, addressing the second research question. Communicative purposes are taken into consideration when presenting these moves. A general account of the communicative purposes of the genre will be presented in the next section, responding to the third research question.

Showing Commitment to Sustainability: A Shared Rhetorical Move of the LSUSR Genre One important aim of CCGA is to identify rhetorical moves that are commonly used in a specific genre by different discourse communities. The common moves can shed light on the commonalities of the genre across cultures. In this study, the analysis of the LSUSR genre reveals one move regularly used across cultures: the move of “Showing commitment to sustainability” (COMMIT).

The COMMIT move is used to emphasize the university’s willingness and readiness to dedicate time and energy to sustainability. Four steps (i.e., rhetorical elements that constitute a move, are often used to express this move): 1. communicating sustainability-related mission or vision $\mathrm { \Gamma } ( \mathrm { < M I S S I O N > }$ ), 2. stating sustainability-related values and beliefs $\scriptstyle \left( < \mathrm { B E L I E F } > \right)$ ), 3. indicating the sustainability approach (<APPROACH $>$ ), and 4. showing willingness to be sustainable ( $<$ <WILLINGNESS $>$ ). Consider, for example:

1. As the home of Think and Do $<$ BELIEF $>$ , NC State University approaches this grand challenge as an opportunity <APPROACH $>$ to create practical solutions that transform lives <MISSION $>$ . (North Carolina State University, 2019)   
2. L’Università di Pisa vuole essere soggetto attivo e responsabile nelle complesse dinamiche di sviluppo della società $<$ <WILLINGNESS $>$ , assumendo un ruolo sempre più centrale e propositivo per la crescita del suo territorio di riferimento ${ \bf < M I S S I O N > }$ e cogliendo le grandi direttrici che caratterizzeranno l’innovazione a livello nazionale e internazionale <APPROACH $>$ (Università degli Studi di Pisa, 2019)

[The University of Pisa wants to be an active and responsible subject in the complex dynamics of the development of society <WILLINGNESS $>$ , assuming an increasingly central and proactive role for the growth of its territory of reference ${ \bf < M I S S I O N > }$ and embracing the major guidelines that will characterize innovation at national and international levels <APPROACH $>$ . (University of Pisa, 2019) (Translation by the Author)]

As shown in the above examples, the commitment statement is often composed of more than one of the four steps, among which the MISSION step is most frequently used. Stating sustainability-related missions (create practical solutions that transform lives in Extract 1; crescita del suo territorio “growth of its territory” in Extract 2) contributes to shaping an aspirational university in being sustainable.

The COMMIT move appears in all the texts except for one (see Table II). The textual space dedicated to this move accounts for $9 . 1 \%$ of the total in Italian and $8 . 4 \%$ in English (see Fig. 2) $\mathrm { { ( L L = 0 } } . 8$ , $p$ $= 0 . 3 7 $ ), showing that its importance is similarly recognized by different cultural communities. The regular presence of the COMMIT move in the genre suggests that universities across cultures are aware of highlighting their willingness to be sustainable when communicating about sustainability with their stakeholders. The communicative effect of the COMMIT move is two-fold. On one hand, the leadership endorsement of the sustainability commitment contributes to strengthening the sustainability culture among internal stakeholders. On the other hand, it helps to manage the public impression among external stakeholders and, thus, establishing a sustainable image (i.e., an image of an institution that meets “the needs of the present” [3, p. 41] by contributing to the development of society and being environmentally friendly so as not to compromise “the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” [3, p. 41]).

Although the COMMIT move has similar frequency and extensiveness in the Italian and the American subcorpora, it varies in terms of ideational realization: in other words, content-related themes that project the subject matters that the author is concerned with [19, p. 160], or according to SFL, in the language the ideational metafunction is intended to “organize, understand, and express our perceptions of the world and of our own consciousness” [70, p. 10]. In a rhetorical move, the ideational metafunction is typically realized by content-related resources or thematic words that can reflect our perceptions of the world. Using NVivo 12, we analyzed the content of the move and identified words symbolizing specific themes. Table III shows the themes that appear in more than one LSUSR. The results show that sustainability is a frequent theme in both samples. In terms of cross-cultural differences, the themes related to society, culture, economy, and development are frequently found in the Italian sample but are absent in the American sample, which refers more frequently to the environment.

Fig. 2. Extensiveness of the 10 moves in the Italian and the American LSUSR genre-texts.

Besides the COMMIT move, the LSUSR genre also uses other move types to promote the image of the sustainable university. The following sections will discuss how these move types are distributed in the American and the Italian subcorpora.

American LSUSR Genre: A Focus on Highlighting Key Performance As shown in Fig. 2, four moves with an explicit image-building function are more frequently and extensively used in the American sample than in the Italian. They are “Reporting sustainability performance” (PERFORMANCE), “Assessing sustainability performance” (ASSESS), “Showing

sustainability-related competence” (COMPETENCE), and “Previewing future performance” (FUTURE).

The PERFORMANCE move accounts for $3 3 . 8 \%$ of the textual space (see Fig. 2) in the American subcorpus but only $1 . 5 \%$ in the Italian subcorpus $\mathrm { ( L L = - 1 5 1 0 . 4 2 }$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). It appears in seven of the nine sample texts (see Table II). The move is absent from the leadership statements of the sustainability reports of Purdue University and the University of Washington. The reason for the absence of the move can be explained by the presence of a section (entitled “Achievements” by Purdue University and “Accomplishments” by the

University of Washington), which provide an overview of the key performance of the university.

The PERFORMANCE move highlights salient events, operations, achievements, or accomplishments of the university during the reporting period (Extract 3 and Extract 4). It contributes to establishing an image of the sustainable university through facts and data.

3. NC State ranked 17th on The Princeton Review’s 2019 “Top 50 Green Colleges” list, leaping 25 spots from No. 42 in 2018. (North Carolina State University, 2019)   
4. In 2018-2019, iSEE and the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) fully established a $\$ 115$ million Bioenergy Research Center. (University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, 2018-2019)

Previous studies of CEO statements in American corporate sustainability reports have highlighted the PERFORMANCE move as an obligatory move [37], [38]. The corporate discourse convention in highlighting performance in leadership statements is also emphasized by American universities. However, this rhetorical choice is not in the foreground of Italian leadership statements: only two Italian statements provide some performance information by mentioning briefly the establishment of sustainability-related courses in the university.

Both the GRI standards (adopted by Italian universities) and STARS (followed by American universities) encourage a reference to key achievements in leadership statements. The GRI standards suggest that the statement “should”

include “key events, achievements, and failures during the reporting period” [71, p. 20]. The STARS notes that the cover letter “may” provide a description of “key achievements or highlights from the report” [44, p. 2]. Although the GRI guidelines use a tone of higher deontic degree (should) than the STARS manual (may), its impact on Italian universities is less prominent in the present study.

Another move that characterizes the American leadership statements is “Assessing sustainability performance” (ASSESS), which appears in eight American genre-texts but is absent in the Italian sample. This move is used to provide an evaluation of the university’s performance on sustainability and often uses evaluative markers. Consider the following examples.

5. For the Center and its affiliates, 2019 was a remarkably impactful year with new collaborative research, funding opportunities, as well as outreach and engagement activities. (Purdue University, 2019)   
6. As Chair of the Environmental Stewardship Committee, I am continuously impressed at and inspired by the innovation happening across our campuses. (University of Washington, 2017)

Extract 5 uses evaluative markers (remarkably impactful) to provide a positive assessment of the sustainability performance of the university’s internal organizations (the Center and its affiliates) in the reporting year. In Extract 6, the high-ranking representative (Chair of the Environmental Stewardship Committee) expresses her personal reaction (impressed and inspired) in acknowledging that the university is doing well in being sustainable. It seems clear that the communicative purpose of the ASSESS move, which is always used as a positive appraisal, is to establish an image of a capable sustainability practitioner.

The COMPETENCE move accounts for $5 . 6 \%$ in the American sample but only $1 . 6 \%$ in the Italian sample ${ \mathrm { ( L L = - 9 4 . 8 8 } }$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). This move emphasizes the capability and competence of the university in being sustainable (see Table I for examples). The FUTURE move occupies $2 . 9 \%$ of the textual space in the American subcorpus but is absent from the Italian subcorpus. It shows the university’s commitment to a concrete sustainability-related action or optimistic predictions of results that will be achieved in the future (examples of the move can be found in Table I). Both of the moves can contribute to the establishment of a positive sustainability-related image.

Italian LSUSR Genre: A Focus on Introducing the Report: As illustrated in Fig. 2, two moves with image-building function are more frequently and extensively used in the Italian sample than in the American sample. They are “Presenting sustainability-related approach/strategy/practice” (STRATEGY), which accounts for $1 4 . 5 \%$ of the Italian sample and $1 . 6 \%$ of the American sample $\mathrm { ( L L = } 4 3 6 . 4 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), and “Demonstrating sustainability-related duty” (DUTY), which accounts for $1 3 . 9 \%$ of the Italian sample and $3 . 6 \%$ of the American sample ${ \mathrm { ( L L = } 2 3 8 . 9 9 }$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 _ { . }$ ).

Instead of reporting accomplished actions or achievements with the PERFORMANCE move, Italian leadership statements prefer to underline the university’s approach to sustainability, using the STRATEGY move. This move highlights the university’s attention to sustainability on the managerial level. Extract 7, for example, underlines that the university adopts an international approach to sustainability.

7. L’Università di Torino si allinea, così, ad una tendenza internazionale, nata negli Stati Uniti e in Gran Bretagna, che rende le Università anchor institutions: soggetti capaci di offrire stabilmente una leva di sviluppo delle comunità locali …. (Università degli Studi di Torino, 2017-2018).

[Thus, the University of Turin aligns itself with an international trend, born in the United States and Great Britain, that makes universities anchor institutions: subjects capable of providing stable leverage for the development of local communities …. (University of Turin, 2017-2018) (Translation by the Author)]

The communication preference of managerial aspects instead of detailed and concrete social and environmental performance is noted also in Sordo et al. [16], which finds that Italian university social reports communicate mainly managerial aspects. Similar tendencies are also found in social reports published by the Italian local government. They are driven by “management fashion” and tend to describe managerial performance rather than social and environmental information [71], [72].

The DUTY move is used to demonstrate that universities need to be sustainable by referring to circumstances, challenges, or universities’ functions, responsibilities, and duties (examples of the move can be found in Table I). On the one hand, it is educational and can, to some extent, enhance the awareness of the universities’ social role, which is one of the multiple motivations for

SR [16]. The educational tone also recalls the concept of “education for sustainable development” in HE [5]. On the other hand, it implies the university’s intention of being sustainable.

Although the STRATEGY move and the DUTY move that make some contributions to the communicative purpose of image-building are used more in the Italian sample, they represent a limited proportion overall. To summarize, in the LSUSR genre, moves that contribute explicitly to building a sustainable image are COMMIT, PERFORMANCE, STRATEGY, ASSESS, COMPETENCE, and DUTY. These moves are sources that can convergently exert “propulsive” discourse force that “pushes” forward the communicative purpose of building a sustainable image. The larger the quantity of these moves, the greater the image-building discourse force. For example, if the university claims a commitment to sustainability and, at the same time, presents its sustainability-related performance, the discourse force used for image-building will be greater in comparison to merely claiming commitment.

The moves described above in total account for $4 0 . 6 \%$ in the Italian sample and $6 3 . 1 \%$ in the American sample $\mathrm { ( L L = - 1 9 0 . 4 5 }$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), which means that the discourse force used for image-building is greater in the American sample than in the Italian sample. In other words, the Italian sample shows less emphasis than the American sample on showing that the university is doing well on sustainability issues. Instead, the Italian sample shows a particular preference for the move “Introducing the sustainability report” (REPORT), which appears in all of the Italian texts (see Table II). It occupies considerable textual space (extensiveness $= 4 4 . 8 \%$ , see Fig. 2) in the Italian sample, but is moderately used in the American sample (extensiveness $= 1 0 . 2 \%$ ) $\mathrm { [ L L = 8 6 3 . 3 5 }$ , $p <$ 0.1).

This move can be regarded as an “obligatory move” (e.g., [20], [21]) or “constitutive move” [19] (i.e., a move that is regularly present in a genre and characterized by significant textual dimension and key communicative functions). A constitutive move is the essential part of a genre and reflects the general communicative purpose of the genre [19, p. 27].

The REPORT move focuses on the report per se and is not explicitly related to image-building. It presents the basic information of the report (e.g., reporting period, report structure, and general content), indicates the methodology used to collect data and prepare the report, or demonstrates the importance and significance of the report. Consider the following example.

8. Questa edizione 2018 del Bilancio Sociale di Ateneo testimonia, per il terzo anno consecutivo, il rinnovato impegno dell’Università di Firenze verso un sistematico ed organico percorso di rendicontazione di sostenibilità.

Nel perseguimento di tali obiettivi informativi, il presente bilancio sociale si articola lungo sei filoni di analisi.

Oltre all’aggiornamento delle informazioni al 2018 e alla conferma dell’aderenza alle linee guida per la rendicontazione di sostenibilità della Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), abbiamo ritenuto essenziale introdurre il tema dei Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

(University of Florence, 2018) (Translation by Author)].

Extract 8 represents the main content of the leadership statement in the sustainability report of Università degli Studi di Firenze. Major textual space is dedicated to present the content (e.g., si articola lungo sei filoni di analisi “structured along six lines of analysis”) and guidelines used to prepare the report (e.g., abbiamo ritenuto essenziale introdurre il tema dei Sustainable Development Goals “we felt it was essential to introduce the topic of Sustainable Development Goals”), and to demonstrate why it is important to publish the report (e.g., rappresenta una scelta importante per un ente come il nostro “represents an important choice for an institution like ours”). In the genre of Italian sustainability reports, the leadership statement seems to function as an introductory and explanatory part of the whole report: it tends to provide a brief introduction of the report and justify the reporting action.

This rhetorical choice (i.e., the extensive use of the REPORT move) is not prescribed by reporting guidelines, but is rather a discourse convention of the Italian HE community. Almost all the Italian samples claim that they use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, which prescribe that the report should include a statement from the most senior decision maker of the organization [71, p. 20]. Accordingly, all of the Italian leadership statements are from the rector or president of the university. However, the contents of the leadership statements are not particularly in line with the GRI standards, which claim that the statement should include strategic priorities with regard to sustainability, broader trends, key events, achievements and failures, and targets for the next year, etc. [71, p. 20]. A general introduction to the report from the rector, which is not required by the GRI standards, seems to be a conventional communicative action among discourse members, pointing to the phenomenon of “writing conformity” [73], a tendency of matching writing behaviors (e.g., the use of linguistic and structural patterns) to group norms.

# DISCUSSION

The rhetorical moves that constitute a genre are characterized by specific local communicative purposes, which can reflect the overall communicative purposes of a genre. The move analysis in this study reveals that both the Italian and the American leadership statements in university sustainability reports use the move “Showing commitment to sustainability,” which highlights the university’s goodwill in being sustainable. The COMMIT move reflects that one shared communicative purpose of the Italian and American genre is to establish an image of a sustainable university. This cross-culturally homogeneous communicative need recalls SR’s

function of reputation improvement. The act of SR contributes to the development of a sustainability culture, which is considered as a key success factor in improving the image of the university [13]. The improvement of image can then help universities to lever more funding and attract better students and researchers [5, p. 9]. This finding implies that the sustainable university image is a universal concern for HE institutions across national borders against the background of the increasing attention paid to sustainability in universities around the world [6].

Genre-texts produced by discourse communities from different cultures may share a particular communicative purpose, which may be realized through different strategies by these different discourse communities. In terms of the move “Showing commitment to sustainability,” American universities prefer to mention their contribution to environmental issues. This finding is in line with Sassen and Azizi’s [6] study which suggests that in SR, American universities tend to focus more on the environmental dimension than on the economic and social dimensions. This tendency may be related to the US government’s financial support for university-level environmental projects [6]. Moreover, American university ranking systems, such as STARS, have a stronger focus on the environmental dimension but pay less attention to social topics in comparison to the GRI guidelines [6].

The roles and contents of corporate social responsibility statements may be understood differently across cultural contexts [74], which is also true for the perceptions of sustainability in HE. Definitions of sustainability in HE are malleable and fluid [75], and universities tend to place emphasis on different aspects of the term [75]. The various ways of expressing commitment to sustainability can reflect how universities in different cultures perceive sustainability. Although American universities pay more attention to environmental aspects, Italian universities tend to emphasize their commitment to society and to the national and local contexts in particular. This content difference might be related to generic norms that constrain the genre: the STARS reporting standards have a strong environmental focus but refer only marginally to social topics, which, on the other hand, are among the key concerns of the GRI guidelines [6].

The environmental focus of American universities might also be related to the increasing number of students who consider a university’s commitment to environmental issues as one important criterion for university selection [14]. Another content feature of the Italian sample is the frequent use of words related to the topics of teaching and research. The emphasis on these topics is noted also in the contents of the general social reports published by Italian universities, which pay particular attention to disclosing managerial aspects related to research, teaching, local context, etc., while rarely communicating about environmental aspects [16].

The realization of a genre’s specific communicative purpose varies not only in terms of content but also in terms of discourse force (i.e., quantity and intensity of discourse strategies dedicated to realizing the specific communicative purpose). This study shows that the communicative purpose of establishing a positive image of a sustainable university is present in both the Italian and the American LSUSR genre. This communicative purpose can be achieved not only with the COMMIT move but also with other move types. The cross-cultural differences in the use of various move types and their distribution reflect the variation of the discourse force dedicated to realizing the communicative purpose.

It seems that American leadership statements are more explicit in establishing a positive image of a sustainable university, while Italian universities dedicate less discourse force in this respect. The data show that the American subcorpus is characterized by higher extensiveness and frequency of move types that can contribute to the image-building purpose than the Italian sample. In particular, the dominant move in the Italian sample is the REPORT move, which focuses on a general introduction of the report. A general description of the structure, content, and function of the report can help the reader to better understand the act of reporting, but it is not explicitly linked to the improvement of the university’s sustainable image.

The cross-cultural divergence in move distribution suggests that Italian universities use less discourse force in realizing the communicative purpose of building a sustainable image than American universities. Although testing how contextual factors influence discourse is not within the scope of this study, some background information may be helpful in understanding the cross-cultural genre differences. The findings imply that American universities place greater importance on promoting the university by emphasizing their commitment and contribution to sustainability.

This focus of university promotion may be related to the noticeable trend of marketization in HE in the US [45]. American universities are required to compete on sustainability and environmental issues to attract more students because the successful recruitment of new students is important for universities in terms of tuition fees [6]. In Italy, on the other hand, HE communication is not widely influenced by market logic [45]. This fact may account for why Italian universities are less sensitive to the discourse of self-promotion for student recruitment when communicating sustainability.

To summarize, the shared communicative purpose indicates that building an image of a sustainable university is becoming a global concern. The noticeable cross-cultural differences in the move structure of the LSUSR genre, however, imply a low degree of internationalization and standardization of the genre. This is understandable because SR in HE is still in its early stages in the Italian and the American contexts [6], [11], especially when compared with SR by corporations [7, p. 75]. As suggested by Lozano [7, p. 75], universities could learn from the experiences of SR in the corporate world. However, it should also be noted that a contextualized approach is required to fulfill the specific needs of HE institutions [76].

# CONCLUSION

This study shows that the Italian and American LSUSR genres share the communicative purpose of establishing the image of the sustainable university but use different strategies in realizing this communicative purpose. In terms of content, when showing commitment to sustainability, the Italian subcorpus puts more emphasis on teaching, research, and the university’s social role in relation to the national and local context, while the American counterpart pays more attention to environmental issues. The emphasis on different aspects of sustainability points to the different understandings of sustainability in HE across cultures.

Moreover, the CCGA reveals that Italian and American universities understand and employ the LSUSR genre in different ways. American leadership statements seem to exert more “propulsive” discourse force to push forward a positive sustainable university image. Italian universities, on the other hand, are less interested in self-promotion. Instead, they spend more space orienting the reader to the report. These variations point to specific genre conventions across cultures.

The CCGA reveals the multiple functions of the LSUSR genre: it can be used to strengthen the image of a university’s commitment to sustainability, as in the case of the American universities, or it can be used to introduce the structure and content of the whole report, as the Italian universities do. This finding raises a question: which communicative function should be exploited or prioritized in the LSUSR genre? The introductive function would help readers to understand what the sustainability report is and what can be found therein. This function might be helpful for readers who are not familiar with the emerging genre of university sustainability reports. Practitioners could consider the target audience in deciding whether to prioritize the introductive function in the LSUSR genre.

The promotional function, on the other hand, helps the university build a positive image, which can also contribute to promoting the sustainability culture among members of the discourse community. One function of a genre is to reinforce the readers’ membership in a discourse community. From a discursive perspective, leadership influences others and defines and explains practices or policies within the organizational context [36, p. 313]. The LSUSR genre, as it is endorsed by university presidents or other high-ranking leaders who play crucial roles in foregrounding sustainability within the university’s culture [13], represents an opportunity to promote sustainability-related values within the discourse community by establishing the image of the sustainable university. Although the promotional intention per se is sometimes questioned because it might lead to hypocritical discourse, it can to some extent be helpful in stimulating improvements in sustainability.

This perspective is similar to Christensen et al.’s view that regards “hypocritical” corporate social responsibility communication as “aspirational talk,” by which corporations proclaim higher values than they actually practice, while pressuring themselves to fulfill this commitment [77]. In this perspective, the potential of the promotional function in developing an institutional culture of sustainability should be one important consideration for practitioners when deciding

whether to take advantage of the image-building function in a helpful way, within the LSUSR genre.

In terms of practical implications, this study has revealed cross-cultural diversity in the exploitation of the LSUSR genre. This can raise awareness of the existence of various genre resources and help to enrich the genre repertoire of practitioners who participate in sustainability communication in the global context. In terms of theoretical implications, this study has proposed the notion of “discourse force.” When discussing cross-cultural genre differences, previous studies have focused mainly on the use of different move types (e.g., [64], [66]), but no studies have attempted to assess the discourse force dedicated to a specific

communicative purpose of the genre. This aspect is worthy of more attention in future genre research.

The research was constrained by the limited number of sustainability reports containing leadership statements published by Italian and American universities. However, the results have already had some practical implications in enhancing the degree of reflexivity of practitioners in sustainability communication. Future research could investigate other genre types of university leadership discourse related to sustainability to explore how university leaders contribute to building a sustainable university image and to reinforcing the institutional culture of sustainability.

# APPENDIX

Table IV lists the university sustainability reports containing leadership statements that were analyzed in preparing this article.

The following is an annotated example of a leadership statement, this one taken from the 2018 sustainability report of the University of Connecticut.

# Letter From the Director $< \mathbf { T I T L E } >$

UConn has long been a HE leader in sustainability and has made transparency a priority in reporting about our efforts. <COMPETENCE $>$ This report not only outlines UConn’s most recent performance as we work towards our 2020 Campus Sustainability goals, but it also uses graphics to clearly show progress made, or ground lost, over the past two years. <REPORT>

In order to track these trends, we’ve continued to highlight certain metrics from the University’s curren responses to the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, & Rating System (STARS) survey. STARS sets

uniform standards for our sector that are developed by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in HE (AASHE), and survey responses are audited for accuracy. <REPORT>

Beyond the numbers in this report, UConn has had noteworthy accomplishments these past two years <PERFORMANCE $>$ - January 2017: In a message to the University community, President Herbst reiterated UConn’s commitment to sustainability as a core value and endorsed the 2020 Vision Plan for Campus Sustainability and Climate Leadership. February 2017: President Herbst became a member of Second Nature’s Climate Leadership Steering Committee. - [ …] $<$ <PERFORMANCE>

UConn is making real progress toward achieving ambitious goals that inspire and institutionalize best practices, innovative programs, and tangible projects creating “living laboratories” across our campus. Many of these activities have been at the intersection of sustainability’s three tenets: environmental, social, and economic responsibility. <ASSESS>

We will continue to make this growth a priority and challenge ourselves to push beyond our 2020 goals. <COMMIT $>$ In fact, during 2019, we’ll begin the collaborative process of meeting with multiple University departments and stakeholders in order to set strategic targets for 2025, the next interim Climate Action Plan milestone. <FUTURE>

To quote from the UConn student-written and Senate-endorsed letter mentioned above, “academic institutions—as centers of learning and innovation for the next generation of leaders—must help lead the charge.” ${ \bf \nabla } { \bf < D U T Y > }$ UConn accepts this mission. We must, and will, do our part to ensure a clean, healthy, prosperous, and more sustainable world for future generations. <COMMIT>
