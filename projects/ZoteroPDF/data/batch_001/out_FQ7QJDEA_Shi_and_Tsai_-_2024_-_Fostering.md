# ABSTRACT

A number of Mobile-Assisted-Language-Learning (MALL) apps have been developed to enlarge students’ vocabulary. However, few studies have discussed the potential to learn words deeply and productively. Therefore, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a mind mapping MALL app as an aid to assist northern Taiwan EFL participants in learning vocabulary. The research questions aimed to examine changes in vocabulary learning outcomes, and the perspectives the participants held regarding the app. Data were collected through tests (pretest, posttest and delayed posttest), visualized vocabulary knowledge mind mappings, and surveys. The posttest results showed the use of the mind mapping MALL app enhanced EFL vocabulary learning $\scriptstyle ( t = 3 . 6 8 _ { \scriptscriptstyle 4 }$ , $p { < } . 0 5 ;$ ; Cohen’s $d { = } 0 . 8 1$ , $r = 0 . 3 8$ ). In addition, based on the questionnaire responses, experimental participants agreed that not only did the MALL app provide them with a feasible way to move from receptive ways of learning to productive ways of learning, but it also bolstered word consciousness and word retention. Analytical ANCOVA results also verified that learners benefited more from the mind mapping app with respect to learning performance in their delayed posttest $\left( t = 3 . 4 5 \right.$ , $p { < } . 0 5$ ; Cohen’s $d { = } 0 . 7 7$ , $r { = } 0 . 3 6$ ). The findings may be construed as an effective method towards learning foreign words and further exploring the potential of vocabulary learning and MALL.

# 1.  Introduction

Mind mapping is a structured process for organizing and dissecting ideas and information. Mind mapping tools are widely and mainly used in writing and reading for the advantages of clearly developing and linking relationships among different components and ideas. Researchers and educators who favor mind mappings believe that they facilitate learners’ generating and categorizing diverse ideas, as well as solving typical writing problems, such as elaboration and fluency (Fan & Chen, 2021; Fu et  al., 2019; Kılıçkaya, 2020; Lin, 2019; Sebit & Yildiz, 2020). Moreover, mind mapping is widely used in reading for its graphic organizer features that facilitate recall of main ideas in articles and their connections and relationships among paragraphs (Hazaea & Alzubi, 2016; Liu et  al., 2010; Mohaidat, 2018; Riahi & Pourdana, 2017). Mind mapping gives learners not only a bird’s-eye view of the entire knowledge but also every single concept within it.

Though previous mind mapping research has been investigated and has been shown to be useful for learning. However, these studies have mainly conducted feasible for English reading and writing. Comparatively little has been done to explore the potential of mind mapping employed in vocabulary learning, even though research has demonstrated that mind mapping is effective and supportive for learning to lead learners to go beyond the lower level of Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et  al., 1956).

The benefits of mind mapping have been extensively studied, but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been compared with paper-pencil or MALL mind mapping for vocabulary learning. This study explores how mind mapping can be used to improve vocabulary learning and word knowledge acquisition, especially when mind mapping word knowledge is created by learners themselves. Accordingly, the theoretical framework of this research is to contribute to the possibility of employing mind mapping in learning vocabulary within the era of digital generation.

# 2.  Review of the literature

# 2.1.  Mall as tools in EFL vocabulary learning settings

Successful EFL language learning is widely associated with vocabulary. Ramos and Dario (2015) claimed that vocabulary learning is the building block of language learning. The relationship between vocabulary acquisition and the four-key-language-skills is well established (Groot, 2000; Schmitt, 2000). Memory theory also stresses the importance of practicing new words after acquiring them; otherwise, the newly-learned words will be forgotten afterwards (Pimsleur, 1967). However, EFL learners’ exposure to target vocabulary is undeniably inadequate to support word retention. In light of this thorny issue, researchers have become interested in the specific effects of vocabulary learning strategies and pedagogies. According to a significant finding from Harris et  al. (2016), they indicated that regardless of what type of vocabulary learning strategies and pedagogies adopted, a cognitive apprenticeship model (modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection and exploration) should correspond to instructional activities. Across their study, there is consistent evidence that a successful language learner is impacted not only by tools applied, but also by instructions received. Nonetheless, there is a lack of robust research on how and what learners represent their word knowledge such as the link between the learned words and the newly learned vocabulary.

From traditional methods to CALL and MALL, language teaching and learning has come a long way. Several researchers have explored the potential of flipped MALL applications in learning with the advent of portable communication technology. Alternatively, integrating technology increases vocabulary learning efficiency (Hao et  al., 2021). For example, the incorporation of mobile devices into learning enhances learners’ motivation to learn (Ciampa, 2014; Furió et  al., 2015; Su & Cheng, 2015). Moreover, Huang et  al. (2016) set out to empirically test the difference between mobile and traditional learning tools. In the study, learners were taught a five-step vocabulary learning strategy (FSVL) meant to identify target words, get them, comprehend them, consolidate them, and use them to see whether their performance differed. Based on the findings, the authors concluded that mobile learning could have implications for bolstering not only learners’ motivation but also learning results. Similar findings have also been found by Chen et  al. (2016), in which mobile-based games make learning more intriguing and exciting. The results are consistent with the positive impact of MALL on language learning.

Portable technology has led to a trend toward MALL language learning. For example, it is alleged that MALL vocabulary learning helps learners learn more effectively through the use of applications with built-in features (Ozer & Kılıç, 2018). There are a wide range of apps capable of incorporating vocabulary learning and assessment features. Various studies have shown positive effects of built-in features on vocabulary learning (Basal et al., 2016; Dizon, 2016; Guaqueta & Castro-Garces, 2018; Hao et  al., 2019; Hu, 2013; Klimova, 2018; Sanosi, 2018; Tai, 2012; Wu, 2015). As opposed to traditional teaching styles, MALL uses both constructivist and learner-centered approaches, enabling students to learn words with active engagement and motivation (Saran et  al., 2012; Sato et  al., 2015). Furthermore, mobile technology has shown great potential in enhancing learning experiences, both formally and informally in and out of language classes (Liu & Chen, 2015). There is a consensus among previous studies that MALL applications promote learners’ vocabulary acquisition (Chiang, 2018; Kassem, 2018; Klimova, 2020; Wu, 2015). Although MALL appears to be an essential trend today, teachers should encourage students to build up their own vocabulary pools to develop a broad scope of word knowledge. MALL language learning, however, still leaves students with few opportunities to construct their own word knowledge. There is little opportunity for learners to strategically relate their existing knowledge to the target words.

Despite the many benefits of MALL vocabulary learning approaches, difficulties still arise in EFL vocabulary learning settings. The first and foremost criticism of EFL environments focuses on the lack of authenticity in English learning contexts, which affects how instructors plan and design vocabulary activities (Chien, 2020). Therefore, a teacher-centered teaching environment still prevails (Chien, 2017; Wu, 2009), leading to traditional teaching methods. In the traditional instructional mode, participants complained that they were bored and that vocabulary learning was monotonous, leaving them uninterested and upset (Wu, 2018; Wu & Huang, 2017). It is apparent that the above-mentioned studies failed to take into account the fundamental debates in EFL MALL settings. That is, vocabulary learning is not sufficient for students to gain a deep understanding of words. Students’ learning of target word strategies needs to be supported and sustained through more pedagogically constructive vocabulary learning approaches. In view of this phenomenon, it is necessary to build a supportive, student-centered vocabulary learning environment in order to aid learners in retaining learned words (Jaiswal, 2019).

A thorough study of the benefits of MALL has yet to be conducted (Schwabe & Göth, 2005). Chen et  al. (2019) then discussed the importance of selecting vocabulary learning apps that meet the individual needs of students. Gamlo (2019) claimed that even though EFL learners were motivated to learn through mobile apps, they exhibited high instrumental motivation when forced to take those compulsory courses. Ballance (2012), for instance, questioned MALL research from Stockwell (2010) by indicating that even though mobile apps (MALL) did outperform PC platforms (CALL) in learning performance, MALL tools were not meaningfully linked to learning activities if learners could also use PCs and traditional paper-and-pencil methods. Similarly, Kukulska-Hulme (2005) pointed out that many portable mobile applications do not correspond to learning objectives. Lin and Lin (2019) argued that much more sophisticated L2 word learning programs need to be developed in order to match the learning goals and motivate learners to learn words to a greater extent. Thus, for MALL to be effective, it should not simply be digitalized or degenerated into behaviorist, teacher-centered imbuing (Burston, 2014). All these findings demonstrate that MALL isn’t just about digitalizing learning and pedagogies, since that would bore and frustrate students, which does not address the fundamental problems and difficulties students have in learning vocabulary.

In a meta-analysis conducted by Mahdi (2018), the researcher indicated that learners primarily learned vocabulary through a receptive method, with little experience in the use and formation of the target words. A productive aspect of MALL vocabulary learning is also important from the perspective of the individual language learner. The right app tool is also necessary for adaptive MALL learning guidance (Khazaie & Ketabi, 2011; Ou-Yang & Wu, 2017). While the above studies provide valuable insights regarding MALL aspects of learning vocabulary, caution needs to be taken before applying results to EFL settings. It should not be assumed that the findings obtained from studies using MALL as stimuli can be generalized to all learning contexts, especially while learners’ exposure to the target words is limited. That is, while the selected vocabulary learning MALL apps enhance vocabulary learning in some ways, unless used with caution, they are not as effective as paper learning materials. The semantic disambiguation of words is, therefore, crucial when teaching vocabulary with MALL apps (Ballance, 2013). This area has been surprisingly ignored until recently, as the majority of the literature on vocabulary learning has focused on the effect of MALL on receptive results.

# 2.2.  Mind mappings in language learning

Mind mapping can be created in a number of ways, including through concept mapping, mind mapping, and argument mapping. Mapping can be used based on the objectives of the educator. Davies (2011) clarified the differences among those mapping tools. In contrast with concept maps, mind mappings are much more form-free. The main characteristic of argument mappings is inference. Based on the definition of Buzan (2018), mind mappings are multi-dimensional, multi-facetted, colorful, and have words and images attached to them. Generally, mind mapping is a tool that makes the whole brain active and stimulated; learners can make radiant thinking and visualize their thinking through mind mapping (Buzan, 2018). During mind mapping, students are required to think, and it promotes learning by creating associations between ideas. The majority use of mind mapping is already becoming more prevalent in reading and writing. This makes the learners establish a holistic picture of what they read and how they can write.

Mind mapping is greatly emphasized by Buzan (2006) and is seen as a technique for improving learning and teaching (Amin & Hina, 2018; Edwards & Cooper, 2010; Hasanah et  al., 2017; Luo, 2019). Mind mapping is generally believed to improve learners’ metacognitive skills, as evidenced by a variety of empirical studies (Astriani et  al., 2020; Fu et  al., 2019; Sweet et  al., 2017). In other words, mind mapping offers a visual representation of how knowledge is visualized from the perspective of learners.

In mind mapping, learners learn how to visualize and organize ideas underlying a concept. Information or knowledge inputs and outputs are what learners do with mind mapping (Buzan, 2002). According to Buran and Filyukov (2015), the mind mapping technique is not only a facilitator of language learning, but it also fosters it through its problem-solving, idea brainstorming, and note-taking features. It is therefore widely acknowledged that mind mapping is an effective method for enhancing learners’ metacognition and thinking abilities. In language learning perspectives, mind mappings have also been extensively researched with positive outcomes (Fu et  al., 2019; Jelodar & Farvardin, 2019; Wang & Chen, 2018; Zhang, 2018). Using mind mapping techniques in English language learning has been proven to stimulate learners to think outside of the box (Besral et  al., 2020; Jiang & Zhang, 2020; Mok et  al., 2008; Pradasari & Pratiwi, 2019; Crites & Rye, 2020; Wu & Chen, 2018; Yunus & Chien, 2016). This means that a learner, due to the use of mind mapping, is encouraged to relate previous experiences within their mind, and learns to understand, to apply, to analyze, to discover, to synthesize, to evaluate and to create their word knowledge (Ausubel, 1961; Bruner, 1961, 1973). The use of mind mapping techniques may lead learners to acquire greater levels of Bloom’s (1956) cognitive taxonomy.

There have been various methods of mind mapping studied, including PC platforms, MALL apps, and blackboard/whiteboard-drawn or traditional paper-pencil methods. Mind mappings play an important role in many aspects of teaching and learning, particularly as catalysts for provoking learners’ thinking. Researchers have found that learners’ critical and reasoning skills are significantly enhanced by mind mapping (Fuad et  al., 2017; Khodadady & Ghanizadeh, 2011; Swestyani et  al., 2018; Wale & Bishaw, 2020). Mohaidat (2018) suggests that learning through mind mapping stimulates learners to use their entire brain in processing the symbols and drawings. Students can create their own diagram to represent and create concept knowledge (Mohaidat, 2018). By using mind mappings, learners can convey their mental representations and monitor their understanding (Amadieu & Salmerón, 2014). Batdi (2015) reviewed 91 empirical studies that used pre-post tests and mind mappings to measure academic achievement, attitude, and retention, and concluded they converged in those areas. However, there has been little attention given to the effect of mind mapping on a learner’s manifestation of metacognitive word knowledge. As a result, further research is necessary regarding the design of metacognitive activities in order to assess students’ performance from multiple perspectives of language learning.

In English reading and writing, mind mapping, the hand-drawn software or handheld devices used to organize and clarify learners’ comprehension of reading as well as their writing structures, has proven to be an effective method. For example, Merchie and Van Keer (2016) investigated 644 participants from 17 different elementary schools and also found that mind mappings triggered deep text learning, stimulated meta-learning and developed learners’ self-awareness of learning how to learn. A mind map can be used individually or collaboratively. Electronic mind maps were useful when processing, analyzing, and discussing texts because learners could discuss and understand the main ideas and sub-ideas (Hazaea & Alzubi, 2016; Mohaidat, 2018; Riahi & Pourdana, 2017). English reading strategies can be enhanced by concept mapping (Liu et  al., 2010).

When writing in English, mind mapping works collaboratively. For example, the online peer assessment enhanced skills in paraphrasing and organizational thinking in writing (Lin, 2019). Furthermore, according to Fu et  al. (2019), digital mind mapping improved students’ creative writing skills, which involved generating diverse ideas, recalling, and recording information. Kılıçkaya (2020) concluded that collaborative digital graphic writing enhanced retention of course content; however, Sebit and Yildiz (2020) found that the individual-mind mapping group outperformed the collaborative-mind mapping group on writing abilities. In contrast, Fan and Chen (2021) concluded that group mind mapping writing was superior to individual writing and suggested that if learners were allowed to collaborate, it might enhance their motivation. It was suggested that the paper-pencil method might be suitable for those who were not familiar with mind mapping.

Using student-generated paper-drawn mind maps, AlSaleem (2019) conducted a study with 130 sixth-grade elementary students, finding that the research group retained and remembered vocabulary words for longer periods of time than the control group. Dilek and Yürük (2013) argued that teacher-prepared mind mapping vocabulary learning techniques benefit learners more than traditional vocabulary teaching processes. Al-Jarf (2016) claimed that learners instructed with mind mapping computer software performed better in learning words. A study by Liu (2016) found that the use of Inspiration software, a computer mind mapping program, as opposed to traditional instruction, resulted in significant differences in vocabulary learning.

In the literature reviewed, a number of vocabulary-learning-related studies have been conducted using teacher-provided, computer-assisted, paper-drawn, or blackboard/whiteboard-drawn mind mapping techniques. Not only do the features of mind mapping matter for the process of a learner’s language learning, but it also depends on how and what learners’ word knowledge output is presented. In the present day, not only remembering words has an impact on a student’s vocabulary acquisition, but also the student’s own knowledge of words. EFL researchers have either investigated the features of mind mapping applied to reading (e.g., article structures) or to writing (e.g., essay compositions). Following the literature review, no study has been done to examine the integration of student-generated mind-mapping MALL app tools into vocabulary learning. Accordingly, the current study attempts to fill this gap by investigating the effects of a student-generated mind mapping MALL app on language learners’ vocabulary performance and their manifestation of word knowledge.

# 2.3.  Previous research on knowing a word

A key component of EFL learners’ language comprehension is word knowledge, according to Dong et  al. (2020). Knowing a word itself is defined as word knowledge that a learner possesses in knowing its form, meaning and use (Nation, 2001). When teaching EFL students, instructors generally expect that their students will learn words by knowing their translations, spelling, and pronunciation after they have finished teaching them. When students learn words in an environment in which exposure to the target language is lacking, passive memorization may result. When referring to knowing a word, it denotes how much learners know about word breadth and depth. When referring to knowing a word, it denotes how much learners know about word breadth and depth. According to Miller (1999), however, knowing a word extends beyond its meaning and pronunciation.

There have been several reviews of studies attempting to describe the concept of knowing a word from the perspective of learning a foreign language. Nation (2001) explained what knowing a word means in the context of language learning. Through the inclusion of word form, meaning, and use, the researcher demonstrated the aspects of what is included in knowing a word. The question of how well a learner knows a word focuses researchers’ attention on how learners use the word and how the word functions in context. In the theory, Nation (2001) related word knowledge to receptive knowledge and productive knowledge. To be specific, receptive word knowledge involves form (sound of words, look of the word and word roots), meaning (word meaning, word concept, related words like synonyms and antonyms) and use (word patterns, collocations, word constrains on use). Productive word knowledge, on the other hand, includes form (word pronunciation, spelling and written forms, and word parts), meaning (word forms to express meanings, concepts to refer to, other words to use) and use (what patterns to use, must-use words or types of words, and under what condition to use the word). Word knowledge, meaning what readers know about the words in a context, is the predictor of comprehension (Stahl, 2003). Therefore, besides learning the meaning of the words, the ability to effectively use those words in context is also closely related to how students are guided to learn (McKeown, 2019).

Knowing target words is a challenging task for EFL learners. It is especially true in terms of developing their vocabulary knowledge. Typically, in Taiwan context, vocabulary learning is primarily done through memorization, recitation and ways related to receptive approaches (Chuo & Yen, 2014; Yang, 2019; Yang & Dai, 2011). However, it is not necessarily the case that production is more valuable than reception, since it depends also on the individual, the environment, and other variables. Although reception learning affects EFL learners whose target language is not the same language system as English itself (Nation, 2001), much more research should have been done to explore the potential of a productive way of acquiring vocabulary by EFL learners.

In terms of learning strategies and pedagogies, reception vocabulary teaching and learning still dominate in Taiwan EFL settings (Chien, 2017; Wu, 2009). Students seldom have the opportunity to learn productively. Much more empirical studies can be conducted to encourage learners to move from receptive learning to productive learning to explore what word knowledge they possess and how it is constructed, examining the efficacy of a productive way of learning vocabulary. Also, in terms of what and how word manifestations are, in a meta-analysis on mobile vocabulary learning, many empirical vocabulary studies failed to consider whether learners can use a word apart from its meaning and translation (Mahdi, 2018). In this regard, learners should have been given more opportunities to learn words rather than merely memorizing words one by one and recognizing their meaning in their native tongue. Finally, in terms of the limited scope of English textbook, it is alternatively worthwhile to examine what vocabulary knowledge EFL learners retain beyond sounds, spellings, and translations. Learning words through word lists and context clues are two receptive strategies noted by Nation (1980), contributing to what English textbooks include and how they are designed in Taiwan. A major reason is that English textbooks rarely cover target words adequately (Teng, 2014). Learners are also rarely given opportunities to go deeper with word learning (Faraj, 2015). By using productive vocabulary learning methods, learners can gain a thorough knowledge of the words (Viera, 2017). Consequently, in a technology-driven era, where exposure to the target words is inadequate, this study incorporates a productive mind mapping method of vocabulary learning into MALL.

# 3.  Purpose of the study and research questions

From the above-reviewed literature, we hope to understand whether implementing the mind mapping MALL app can contribute to significant improvements in vocabulary learning. The purpose of the current study is to provide empirical evidence about the handheld mind mapping app in the EFL vocabulary learning field. Thus, we would like to confirm that with the mind mapping MALL app, EFL learners have the ability to go further with their learning. We also developed a questionnaire with reasonable validity and reliability (see 4.5.3 Self-report questionnaire) to help us gain a deeper understanding of the participants’ perspectives. The research questions of the present study are as follows:

1. Is learning vocabulary through the mind mapping MALL app more effective than learning through the mind mapping paper-pencil method?   
2. What kinds of word knowledge do learners construct?   
3. What are the learners’ perceptions of the use of the mind mapping MALL app to learn vocabulary?

# 4.  Research methodology

# 4.1.  Experimental design

An eight-week quasi-experimental design was conducted during the school semester in this study. Participants came from two classes, one class assigned as the experimental group $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 0 \right)$ ) and the other class as the control group $\langle { \bf n } = 4 0 \rangle$ ). The difference was that the experimental group was guided with learner-self-drawn mind mapping MALL app learning strategy and that the control group was guided with learner-selfdrawn mind mapping traditional paper-pencil learning strategy. The independent variable was the vocabulary learning strategies under investigation. The experimental learners’ perspectives towards the app were also assessed.

An environment that promotes meaningful and purposeful learning should be intentionally created (MacBlain, 2018). In such a learning environment, learners are encouraged to go beyond limits and develop their potential in English vocabulary learning (Ozdem-Yilmaz & Bilican, 2020). The variables that might have affected the results were strictly controlled. Each week, there were two 50-minute sessions. Both groups were taught the target words by the same English teacher during their first 50 minutes of class time. During the second 50-minute session, students in the experimental group learned vocabulary using the

SimpleMind app individually. On the other hand, the students in the control group learned words using the traditional paper-pencil mind mapping method, respectively.

Figure 1 shows the research structures, where independent variable (two different ways to learn new vocabulary), dependent variable (learning achievements) and control variable (the teacher, teaching time slots, places of teaching and learning, teaching and learning materials and teaching approaches) were given. The scope of the experiment was examined: learning achievements.

# 4.1.1.  Learner-self-drawn mind mapping app learning group

During the second learning session, students created their own word knowledge by means of the mind mapping app based on the word lessons from the English textbook, supplementary learning materials and supplementary word review learning materials.

# 4.1.2.  Learner-self-drawn mind mapping paper-pencil learning group

During the second learning session, using the traditional paper-pencil method, students created their own mind mappings based on the word lessons from the English textbook, supplementary learning materials and supplementary word review learning materials.

# 4.2.  Participants

The study involved two classes, one class assigned as the experimental group $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 0 \right)$ ) and the other class as the control group $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 0 \right)$ in Grade 11, aged 16-17, from northern Taiwan who are English majors in vocational high schools. Prior to the experiment, all of them had previously learned how mind mappings work in their writing classes. In the experimental group, there were 13 males and 27 females. The control group contained 14 males and 26 females. Educated in primary and secondary schools in Taiwan, the participants learned English from the first grade (600 vocabulary size required by the Taiwan Ministry of Education, MOE) and up to junior high schools (1200 vocabulary size). The participants took Comprehensive Assessment Programs before entering vocational high schools, so their English vocabulary size was assumed to be the same level. Additionally, we compared vocabulary proficiency between the two groups based on their usual English class performance and Independent-Sample $t$ -test results. Results showed no significant difference $( p { = } . 1 1 4 { > } . 0 5$ , $t = 2 . 5 5$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 7 8 \mathrm { \ : ) }$ ) in the results of experimental (mean score $\ B { : = } \ 8 . 5 7$ , s.d. $= 9 . 0 2$ ) and control groups (mean scores $= 8 . 3 5$ , $\mathsf { s . d . } \mathrm { = } 1 1 . 4 0 \AA$ ). Similarly, from the pretest, there was no significant difference between the performance of the experimental group (mean scores $=$ 5.13, $\mathbf { s } . \mathrm { d } . { = } 1 1 . 1 2 ^ { \cdot }$ ) and that of the control group (mean scores $= ~ 5 . 2 1$ , $\mathsf { s . d . } \mathsf { = } 9 . 0 4$ ); thus, no significant difference was observed between the groups $( p = . 7 4 2 > . 0 5$ , $t = 4 . 3 7$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 7 8 \mathrm { \ : ) }$ ) before the experiment. Also, the homogeneity of the regression coefficients was examined. Statistically, the result did not reach significance $\operatorname { F } \mathrm { = } . 3 3$ , $\scriptstyle P = . 5 7 > . 0 5 )$ .

# 4.3.  Materials

In Taiwan, the MOE textbook censorship criteria govern the rationale for the English textbook editing and publishing. There are mainly five English textbook publishers on the market. Before the semester began, teachers in charge would vote on which English textbook to use. The selected English textbook is designed specifically for English majors to help them improve their proficiency in English, which prepares them for the Technological and Vocational Education Joint College Entrance Examination.

There are 12 lessons in the selected English textbook. There were three examinations during the semester. The experiment included the first four lessons following the teaching progress. The 89 words were distributed over four lessons, one lesson for each week. In Lesson 1, there were 20 target words, 23 in Lesson 2, 24 in Lesson 3, and 22 in Lesson 4.

The vocabulary-learning-part consists of the target words, pronunciation, parts of speech and sample sentences. Antwordprofiler by Anthony (2014) was used to analyze target word levels in order to identify the difficulty level of those words. Target word levels are classified into two groups: General Service List (GSL) and Academic Word List (AWL). While the GSL list is considered more commonly used by English learners, the AWL list shows words in academic contexts, which are much more challenging for EFL learners. Antwordprofiler by Anthony (2014) detected the percentages of the target word difficulty levels in this study as Level 1 $( 2 1 . 1 \% )$ , Level 2 $( 1 5 \% )$ , and Level 3 $( 3 9 . 8 \% )$ . Level 1 (1000 words) and Level 2 (1000 words) belong to the GSL List, while the AWL List, consisting of 570 words, belongs to Level 3.

Aside from the main lessons from the English textbook, students were also provided supplementary learning materials and supplementary word review learning materials based on the target words.

# 4.4.  Research procedure

A quasi-experiment was conducted during the school term, lasting 8 weeks. A total of 89 words from the high school English textbook were used in the experiment. Over the four lessons, 89 target words have been taught (20 words in Lesson 1, 23 words in Lesson 2, 24 words in Lesson 3 and 22 words in Lesson 4).

The variables that could interfere with the results were strictly controlled. Each group was guided by the same English teacher. Learners received the same English lessons, supplementary learning materials, and supplementary word review learning materials based on the target words. Each group received two 50-minute sessions per week. The first 50 minutes of teaching were spent teaching vocabulary lessons to both groups. Each group used the same equipment in the first 50-minute of the session: computers and projectors to display teaching materials on screen. Different experimental interventions were used in the second 50-minute session to learn vocabulary through mind mapping. A mobile phone with Android or iOS system and SimpleMind app was used in the experimental group, while the control group learned word with the paper-pencil method. There were no assignments outside of class for either group. Neither group was assigned any additional homework. Accordingly, the validity and reliability of the present study were taken into strict consideration.

The experiment procedure for both groups is shown in Figure 2. Before the experiment, the pretest was administered. In the second 50-minute session, both groups learned their target words using different learning strategies throughout eight weeks. The posttest was administered in week 9. During week 13, both groups were given the delayed posttest, and the experimental group was subsequently asked to complete a self-report questionnaire.

# 4.5.  Research instruments

# 4.5.1.  Vocabulary assessment

In this study, the vocabulary assessments comprised a pretest, a posttest, and a delayed posttest. A posttest was conducted after the experimental intervention to demonstrate its effectiveness. After four weeks, a delayed posttest was administered to see if the target words were retained.

Figure 2. T he experiment procedure.

89 target-word multiple-choice tests were included (each cloze test with four answers per item and only one correct answer). The item discrimination index is .41, while item difficulty index is .55. In order to prevent practice effects and to standardize the tests, the authors randomly selected 50 target words for each group to assess their learning of the target words, their gains and the retention of the target words. A 50-minute session was spent on the pretest (before the experiment), posttest (in week 9) and delayed posttest (in week 13). The vocabulary assessments were developed by English textbook publishers based on the MOE English textbook censorship and were also subjected to expert verification. Its reliability and validity were confirmed by an educational expert and three English teachers with at least ten years of experience teaching English.

# 4.5.2.  Simplemind mapping MALL app

Figure 3 shows screenshots of the downloaded SimpleMind app and its layout used in this study to answer the second research question. SimpleMind can be downloaded for iOS or Android devices without charge. There is no registration required for the app, which has a simple, user-friendly interface. The best features of SimpleMind are its colorful layouts, free-form or auto-form layouts, the ease of adding topics, editing text, dragging or tapping to add child and sibling topics, adjusting line breaks and width, reorganizing and restructuring, and its auto-store function. The mobile phone penetration rate in Taiwan is high. Participants in the experimental group all have access to either an iOS or Android phone. As part of the experiment, participants were asked to organize and compose their own word knowledge about the target words and then to draw mind mappings with the app to visualize their word knowledge.

# 4.5.3.  Self-report questionnaire

As to answer the third research question, the researchers developed a four-point Likert Scale (from 0 point for strongly disagree to 3 points for strongly agree) to get concrete and specific responses. The midpoint of the Likert scale was not used because from the respondents’ perspective the midpoint could mean the following: no opinion, don’t care, unsure, neutral, equal/both, and neither, as shown in the study conducted by

Nadler et  al. (2015). Meanwhile, if respondents were unfamiliar with the survey, worried about being labeled, afraid of disclosing their social status, or any other sensitive factors, the midpoint would probably be selected (Chyung et  al., 2017; Revilla, 2015). For this reason, we chose to use a Likert Scale of four points in order to better understand the data collected. Therefore, the experimental group was required to form their own opinions regarding the items in the questionnaire.

The questionnaire in the present study has four dimensions to answer the third research question, mainly to invite the MALL app group to express their perspectives regarding the treatment further. To ensure its reliability and validity, the questionnaire was also discussed with three English teachers with at least ten years of teaching experience and verified by a university professor in education expertise. In addition, in order to enhance the presentation of the data, the Cronbach’sαvalues of the four subscales were .932 (Part 1), .917 (Part 2), .833 (Part 3), and .952 (Part 4). The Cronbach’sαvalue of the overall scale was .975, suggesting good internal consistency and reliability of the entire scale.

Researchers examined both the convergent and discriminant validity of the questionnaire. The convergent validity of each part of the questionnaire was analyzed as follows. The items in Part 1 all reached significant differences $_ { \it P } = . 0 0 0$ , two tailed) and the correlations were all above .620. Also in Part 2, there were significant differences $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two-tailed) with correlations above .908. In Part 3, each item also reached significant differences $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two tailed) with the correlations over .723. As in Part 4, each item also reached significant differences $_ { ( p = . 0 0 0 }$ , two tailed) with the correlations over .813. The items in each part converged on the same construct and reached a moderate level. On the other hand, in terms of the discriminant validity of the questionnaire each part reached significant differences $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two tailed) with the correlation above .965.

To clarify the structure of the questionnaire, the principle component analysis (PCA) was also employed as the extraction method, the rotation method of Kaiser (1974) and normalization method of Equamax (Field, 2009). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was .986 (Part 1), .984 (Part 2), .982 (Part 3) and .945 (Part 4), showing that the items in each component share a common factor. The Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was significant, $X ^ { 2 } { = } 3 3 9 . 6 3 6$ $( \mathrm { d f } \ = \ 2 1 $ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 1), $X ^ { 2 } { = } 7 9 . 5 7 4$ $[ \mathrm { d f } = 1$ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 2), $X ^ { 2 } { = } 2 7 . 4 6 4$ $\mathrm { { \dot { d f } } = 1 }$ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 3) and $X ^ { 2 } { = } 2 0 3 . 1 8 7$ $\mathrm { \Delta d f } = \mathrm { \Delta } 6$ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 4), indicating significantly high correlations between the items and each component.

To make the questionnaire more understandable for the EFL learners and to reduce possible misunderstandings that might interfere with the experiment, it was also given to non-experimental students, those who do not take part in both the experimental and control groups.

# 5.  Results

First, the pretest results showed no significant differences between the experimental group (mean scores $\it \Delta \tau = \tau 5 . 1 3$ , $\mathbf { s } . \mathbf { d } . { = } 1 1 . 1 2 ^ { \cdot }$ ) and the control group (mean scores $= 5 . 2 1$ , $\mathbf { s . d . } { = } 9 . 0 4 $ ); thus, no differences were observed between the groups $( p = 0 . 7 4 2 > . 0 5$ , $t { = } 4 . 3 7$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 7 8 $ ) before the experiment.

Second, the vocabulary assessments were developed by English textbook publishers based on the MOE English textbook censorship, and then verified by a professor in Education expertise and three English teachers with at least ten years of teaching experience. The item discrimination index is .41, while the item difficulty index is .55. Test-retest correlations were .5, indicating a moderate stability.

Third, the questionnaire convergent validity in each part all reached significant differences: Part 1 $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two tailed, with correlations above .620), Part 2 $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two-tailed, with correlations above .908), Part 3 $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two tailed, with correlations over .723) and Part 4 $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two tailed, with correlations over .813). The items in each part converged on the same construct and reached a moderate level. The discriminant validity of the questionnaire each part reached significant differences $\scriptstyle ( p = . 0 0 0$ , two tailed) with the correlation above .965. The principle component analysis (PCA) was also employed as the extraction method, the rotation method of Kasier (1974) and normalization method of Equamax (Field, 2009). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was .986 (Part 1), .984 (Part 2), .982 (Part 3) and .945 (Part 4), showing that the items in each component share a common factor. The Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was significant, $X ^ { 2 } = 3 3 9 . 6 3 6$ $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { Q f } = 2 1 $ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 1), $X ^ { 2 } { = } 7 9 . 5 7 4$ $\mathrm { \langle d f = 1 }$ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 2), $\mathrm { X } ^ { 2 } { = } 2 7 . 4 6 4$ $\mathrm { { ( d f = 1 } }$ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 3) and $\mathrm { X } ^ { 2 } { = } 2 0 3 . 1 8 7$ ( $[ \mathrm { d f } \ : = \ : 6$ ; $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 0 0 }$ in Part 4), indicating significantly high correlations between the items and each component.

Findings are presented and arranged according to research questions in the following section.

# 5.1.  Is learning vocabulary through the mind mapping MALL app more effective than learning through the mind mapping paper-pencil method?

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyze the pretest and posttest data collected in order to examine the learning performance of both groups. First, the homogeneity of the regression coefficients was examined. Statistically, the result did not reach significance $( F { = } . 3 3$ , $\scriptstyle P = . 5 7 > . 0 5 )$ ). As a result, both groups had equivalent regression slopes. This confirmed the assumption of homogeneity of regression coefficients. The dependent effect was then adjusted based on the covariance of the experimental group’s pretest. Table 1 demonstrates the ANCOVA results ( $F = 1 5 . 6 9$ , $p { = } . 0 0 0 { < } . 0 5 )$ ), confirming a significant difference between both groups. A higher posttest result was obtained by the experimental group than by the control group. Results show that the learner-drawn mind mapping app learning group outperformed the learner-drawn mind mapping traditional paper-pencil learning group.

Table 2 shows 5.13 mean scores of the pretest results in the experimental group. Based on the 5.21 mean scores in the control group in Table 3, there were no significant differences between the two groups’ performance on their pretest before the experiment $\langle p { = } . 7 4 \rangle . 0 5$ , $t = 4 . 3 7$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 7 8 )$ ).

On the posttest, the experimental group showed a gain of 25.40 mean scores, while the control group showed a gain of 20.00 scores. The delayed posttest result showed a modest increase scores, $7 6 . 8 3 > 7 6 . 7 0$ in the experimental group. There was a slight drop-off in the delayed posttest scores from the control group, $7 0 . 8 0 < 7 2 . 0 5$ . Overall posttest and delayed posttest performance of the experimental group exceeded those of the control group. This is likely due to the experimental participants’ accumulation of their own knowledge of target words with the app as opposed to learning exclusively from the paper-pencil-self-drawn mind mappings. The mind mapping app provided sufficient learning stimulation as well, facilitating the construction of target words knowledge. According to the statistics, the MALL app’s vocabulary learning approach rivals traditional learning methods.

From the results shown in Tables 4 and 5, the pretest-posttest difference $F { = } 1 5 . 6 9$ , $\scriptstyle P = . 0 0 0 < . 0 5$ ) and the pretest-delayed posttest difference ${ \mathit { F } } = 1 2 . 1 5$ , $\scriptstyle { p = . 0 0 1 < . 0 5 } )$ suggested that the experimental group gained significantly more knowledge of the target words than the control group. In both posttest and delayed posttest sections, they achieved superior results. A significant difference was found between the experimental and control groups on the posttest and delayed posttest scores, 5.40 from the pretest-posttest and 6.78 scores from the pretest-delayed posttest. Comparatively to the control group, the experimental group made more progress.

In Table 6, an independent $t$ -test was conducted to analyze the differences in learning performance between the experimental and control groups. The gain scores did not differ significantly between the experimental group and the control group. However, the posttest scores did differ significantly $\stackrel { \cdot } { t } = 3 . 6 8$ , $\scriptstyle { p < . 0 5 }$ ; Cohen’s $d { = } 0 . 8 1$ , $r { = } 0 . 3 8 )$ and delayed posttest scores $\dot { t } = 3 . 4 5$ , $p { < } . 0 5$ ; Cohen’s $d { = } 0 . 7 7$ , $r = 0 . 3 6 )$ between the experimental group and control group. Test-retest correlations were .5, indicating a moderate stability. Compared to those who were guided with a traditional approach to acquiring vocabulary, experimental learners could go beyond rote learning by using the mind mapping app. Nevertheless, in terms of gain scores, some of the reasons why significant differences were not found may be due to variables such as the time limit, participants’ level, as well as the role of rote learning in vocabulary learning.

In response to the first research question: Is learning vocabulary through the mind mapping MALL app more effective than learning through the mind mapping paper-pencil method? Based on the statistical analysis shown above, they did better than their counterparts who learned vocabulary using the traditional paper-pencil method of self-drawn mind mappings. On both the posttest and delayed posttest, two groups showed significant differences. Consequently, the mind mapping MALL app group’s performance stood out in comparison to the control group.

# 5.2.  What kinds of word knowledge do learners construct?

In this section, the manifestations of word knowledge constructed by participants were analyzed. We employed and adapted the concept of knowing a word by Nation (2001, p. 27). The present study categorized word knowledge based on word form, meaning, and use, as shown in Table 7.

# 5.2.1.  Word knowledge mind mappings manifestations from the participants

In Appendix A and B, the experimental group’s and control group’s vocabulary knowledge mind mappings are presented. With the mind mapping MALL app, EFL learners with levels A2, B1 and B2 displayed varying vocabulary knowledge. For those A2s, their word knowledge would be much more form modalities. For example, A2s would draw word spelling mind mappings in written forms (e.g. ch-, in cherish and chilly). Those words had no relation to one another. Instead, they related words based on their alphabetic letters. For those with higher level English proficiency, they constructed word knowledge with use, sentence patterns (e.g. Farmers often employ many temporary workers.). Also, grammatical functions with word patterns could be found (e.g. climate, in humid climate and climate change). Furthermore, concept and referents were also identified (e.g. psychological, psychology, mood, sorrow, grief, wonder, rage).

Table 8 demonstrates visualized word knowledge mind mapping examples from both groups. As listed below, both groups showed their word knowledge by means of form, meaning and use. Nevertheless, it is quite interesting to find that no examples of polysemous, concept included, and synonyms or antonyms were found among the paper-pencil mind mappings in the control group.

Figure 4. A comparison of word knowledge mind mappings.

# 5.2.2.  A Comparison of word knowledge mind mappings generated by participants with varying proficiency levels

Figure 4 presents a comparison of word knowledge mind mappings among learners with different CEFR A2, B1 and B2 levels using either a mind mapping MALL app or mind mappipng paper-pencil method. For those A2s in both groups, they constructed word knowledge mainly by means of manifestations of form. For example, A2s in the experimental group drew: Re-recovery, reaction, reasonable, resident, reconstruction, repay and regard with no relationship among those words; th-thoughtful, thrive, therefore were found in the control group.

As for those B1s, meaning was mainly found in the experimental group: deliver: to give, to send; find: to express feelings, to discover, to realize representing polysemous word knowledge. B1s in the control group showed concept included in cost and take. In terms of B2s, they are much sophisticated learners as word use in setence patterns were found in their mind mappings: People have lived in this valley since ancient times. Collocations were found in the control group learners: arouse curiosity.

Accordingly, mind mapping facilitates word knowledge construction regardless of the learners’ proficiency level. However, the mind-mapping MALL app’s features, such as its colorful layouts, free-form or auto-form layouts, the ease of adding topics, editing text, dragging or tapping to add child or sibling topics, adjusting line breaks and width, reorganizing and restructuring, and its auto-store function make word knowledge construction a lot easier and more efficient. The mind maps in the control group reveal that learners were restricted to drawing because of space limitations and the inability to rewrite. Due to this, their scope of word knowledge manifestation was narrowed.

# 5.3.  What are the learners’ perceptions of the use of the mind mapping MALL app to learn vocabulary?

The participants’ self-report questionnaires are divided into four parts (see Table 9) to answer the third research question.

Part 1 lists word knowledge proceeding of the participants. All agreed $( 1 0 \% )$ or strongly agreed $( 9 0 \% )$ that mind mapping made them think while they were learning, which is crucial for deep word learning and essential for defining, organizing, and reflecting during the word learning process. Learning by thinking guides learners to make use of their cognitive and metacognitive abilities. Learners will find learning more meaningful if they are given the opportunity to put effort into it and stay focused on it. Moreover, the learners reported that they had had an opportunity to explore word usage $( 2 2 . 5 \%$ agreed and $7 7 . 5 \%$ strongly agreed). Much more vocabulary could be related by learners ( $1 2 . 5 \%$ agreed and $8 7 . 5 \%$ strongly agreed). At the same time, with mind mapping app technology learners were able to associate words without time and space limitations $3 0 \%$ agreed and $7 0 \%$ strongly agreed). There is a possibility that the mind mapping app will lead to better word learning. A majority of learners said the app helped them become better word learners ( $1 2 . 5 \%$ agreed and $7 7 . 5 \%$ strongly agreed); however, $1 0 \%$ disagreed. The reason for that might be due to learners’ different proficiency in English contributing to different word learning breadths and depths.

As for being far more word-conscious in learning, $5 \%$ agreed and $9 5 \%$ strongly agreed that. Mind mapping guides learners to explore the relationships that exist between words. Through the mind mapping app word learning, $1 5 \%$ agreed and $8 2 . 5 \%$ strongly agreed that they were able to retain much more words, which was also in line with the delayed posttest statistics analysis in the study though there was $1 \%$ disagreeing word retention. The results were also in accordance with those presented in previous research, which pointed out that it is more practical to teach learners how to learn new vocabulary through MALL over a short period of time rather than to teach them "stunts" (Chwo et  al., 2016, p. 353). Thus, when using technology to guide learning, it is important to take into account the kind of apps and how far they can be useful.

Second, the potential to trigger and motivate vocabulary learning is discussed in Part 2. A minority $5 \%$ strongly disagreed and $1 0 \%$ disagreed) said they did not get involved, and $5 \%$ said they did not pay attention to vocabulary learning with the app. In contrast, $1 2 . 5 \%$ of respondents agreed or $7 5 \%$ strongly agreed that they got involved with the app, and $1 7 . 5 \%$ agreed and $7 7 \%$ strongly agreed that they paid more attention to vocabulary learning with the app. Despite the fact that the majority of learners found the mind mapping app motivating and triggering them to learn words, there was still room for discussion while some learned the opposite. Third, the perspectives from the participants regarding the mind mapping MALL app’s interface demonstrate learners’ willingness to use it in Part 3. They agreed $( 3 2 . 5 \% )$ or strongly agreed $( 6 7 . 5 \% )$ that the app is user-friendly. Additionally, $2 0 \%$ agreed and $8 0 \%$ strongly agreed with their willingness to employ such a word learning approach. As a result of the participants’ responses, it is clear that the mind mapping app is mainly easy to use.

Finally, Part 4 lists participants’ overall psychological perspectives towards the mind mapping MALL app. Compared with traditional learning environments, more than half of participants found mind mapping to be less stressful. They felt relaxed $2 5 \%$ agreed and $6 2 . 5 \%$ strongly agreed). While learning vocabulary this way, they gradually gained confidence ( $1 7 . 5 \%$ agreed and $7 5 \%$ strongly agreed). Similarly, self-drawn mind maps provided a sense of accomplishment to learners ( $1 2 . 5 \%$ agreed and $8 0 \%$ strongly agreed). However, a minority confessed that they did not feel relaxed $( 7 . 5 \%$ strongly disagreed and $5 \%$ disagreed), and that they did not feel more confident with their vocabulary mind mappings $( 2 . 5 \%$ strongly disagreed and $5 \%$ disagreed). They strongly disagreed $( 2 . 5 \% )$ or disagreed $( 5 \% )$ that they had a sense of achievement with a self-drawn mind mapping. Overall, $2 7 . 5 \%$ agreed and $7 0 \%$ strongly agreed with their preference for the mind mapping word learning app with a $2 . 5 \%$ denoting the opposite response.

# 6.  Discussion

This study analyzed the effectiveness of mind mappings, the manifestation of mind mapping word knowledge, and learners’ perspectives of the app. To achieve these objectives, mind mappings were created with a MALL app and paper-pencil method. The first question asked was whether students made progress learning target words by using mind mappings. According to independent sample $t { \cdot }$ -test results, the mind mapping MALL app group performed better. The apps teachers choose and how they use them have a significant impact on the learning of their students (Becker et  al., 2020).

In relation to the second research question, both groups demonstrated their word knowledge in a very productive way. Mobile device activities promote learners’ inquiry learning (Suarez et  al., 2018). Apps for inquiry-oriented learning on handheld devices are more effective than some other technological tools (Sung et  al., 2016). Technology is changing, as are learners, so learners should be at the center of learning: “It is the learner that is mobile, rather than the technology” (Sharples et  al., 2005, p. 5). Learners’ long-term knowledge retention is sustained by inquiry-based learning integrated into MALL ( Ibrahim, 2020; Garzón Bernal, Garzón Bernal, 2018; Schmid, 2015; Ahmed & Parsons, 2013; Vanags et  al., 2013; Hicks Pries & Hughes, 2012 ).

A noteworthy finding is that there were no examples of polysemous, concept-included, synonyms, or antonyms among the paper-pencil mind mappings in the control group. One possible explanation is that learners’ scope was limited by paper-space and not-easy-to-revise-edit limitations. Mind mapping is a boundary-pushing tool that helps learners both deepen and broaden their knowledge of words. With no limitations, learners can draw whatever they have in mind about words.

According to the experimental participants, they held positive perspectives regarding using the MALL app for word learning, contrary to Burston (2014, p.352) “Pedagogically, MALL has lagged behind developments in learning theory and teaching methodologies. Behaviorist, teacher-centered, transmission model programs continue to dominate MALL applications.”

# 6.1.  Effect on vocabulary learning

The MALL app gave learners more opportunities to learn words with inquiry (Namaziandost et  al., 2020; Şahin Kızıl & Savran, 2018). A significant result can be attributed to the supportive and stimulating role of inquiry-based learning, which supported learners to go deeper on their learning journey (Dede et  al., 2017). Mind mapping MALL applications have been used to guide learners to move beyond the lowest level of Bloom’s cognitive taxonomy (Bloom et  al., 1956) with significant results (Chen et  al., 2017; Fu et  al., 2019). Experimental participants demonstrated significantly better learning abilities than the control group on the posttest $F = 1 5 . 6 9$ , $\scriptstyle P = . 0 0 0 < . 0 5 )$ . The mind mapping app allowed learners to go deep into their word learning, which contributed to word retention and awareness after the delayed posttest. The learners were encouraged to construct their own word knowledge when learning words, thus involving themselves in their own thinking. They were given opportunities to advance from low levels of memorizing to much higher levels of thinking and analyzing, according to Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et  al., 1956). Furthermore, they behaved much like language researchers and explorers, which instilled self-esteem and confidence in them (Hao et  al., 2019).

Despite receiving the same target vocabulary input, experimental students outperformed their control counterparts. During their second 50-minute learning session, different approaches to learning led learners to different learning paths, where they built their own word knowledge with the mind mapping MALL app. Active and meaningful learning stimulates the whole brain while the student is experiencing their own learning. They were learning in the language rather than about the language. Compared to the control group, which used a traditional paper-pencil mind mapping method, the learners in this group were given a more restricted learning path. Based on the findings in this study, the MALL app is conducive to vocabulary learning as it empowers learners to produce and retain their own word knowledge.

# 6.2.  The mind mapping MALL app learning path

Based on the theories of Ausubel (1961) and Bruner (1961, 1973), Figure 5 illustrates the direction of learning with mind mappings during the second 50-minute session. In the traditional learning approach, the learning process usually ends at step 2: identifying the target words, classifying them into parts of speech, and memorizing them individually. In the control group, despite the use of learner-self-drawn mind maps on paper, students were still only allowed a limited amount of space within the paper. For example, some word knowledge was not found in the control group. While there are variables that interfere with learners, one possible reason could be the limited functions within the paper. There was little opportunity for learners to explore more deeply and widely without MALL.

Students need inquiry-based learning environments to develop higher level thinking skills (Yulianti et  al., 2018). Learning through mobile devices promotes inquiry learning (Suarez et  al., 2018). Inquiry-oriented learning on handheld devices is more effective than other technologies (Sung et al., 2016). Using the mind mapping MALL app learning approach, experimental learners were exposed to five different learning outcomes, depending on their individual differences. With the app, they had more opportunities to engage in knowledge seeking and building. Learning is enhanced when thinking is involved. Thinking is crucial to learning a language (Li, 2016). In addition, thinking leads to reflecting and evaluating. It is in the act of reflecting and evaluating that knowledge is gained.

Figure 5. T he direction of learning in the second 50-minute learning session. Note: 1. Solid arrows: student-centered 2. Two-way arrows: the circular interaction in between 3. One-way arrows: the direction or the results

From the mind mapping data collected, first, target words were identified (to recognize the target words), then they were categorized (to categorize target words based on form, meaning and use). Participants were then guided to explore and collect information about the target words (to link previous knowledge with the new one). They used the MALL app in steps 3 and 4 to organize and construct (to organize or dissect target words based on their form, meaning and use word knowledge) their own word knowledge using the mind mapping tool.

Throughout the learning process, their thinking, reflection, and evaluation were stimulated and inspired (to go beyond memorize, understand and then move forward to apply, analyze, evaluate and create their own word knowledge based on Bloom’s taxonomy). As a result, they developed a distinctive learning experience.

# 6.3.  Students’ perspective towards the treatment

Students’ engagement with the mind mapping MALL app learning approach is positively correlated with the results for research question three. Active involvement contributes to learning based on the responses from the participants’ self-report questionnaire. Getting focused promotes thinking. The process of thinking leads to understanding and further learning. Based on Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy, learners were given opportunities to advance beyond low cognitive levels. Through this approach, learners gain a better understanding of words and improve their memory retention. Learners become more self-reliant language researchers and knowledge builders. Using mind mapping apps, learners can search for, accumulate, and construct new words to store, share, retrieve, retain, and transfer word knowledge.

Based on Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy and Nation (2001, 1980), Figure 6 illustrates vocabulary learning by using mind mapping MALL apps using data collected from the questionnaires of participants. The intersection on the left represents the breadth and depth of word knowledge a learner represents. Some learners demonstrate the breadth and depth of word knowledge in word form sections. Other learners may demonstrate word knowledge via word meaning and word use. The way in which learners acquire words will determine how they demonstrate word knowledge. Still others demonstrate word knowledge through their use of words in the context. Students who display this level of understanding show high word knowledge. As a result, students are guided to go beyond traditional learning strategies, which increases their chances of forming an intersection on the right: word retention, word awareness, and self-constructed knowledge.

Another finding from the study was that vocabulary mind mappings (as expressions of learners’ thinking) exhibited how learners constructed their knowledge (see Appendix A and B). The process of learning words varied from learner to learner, which indicates how learners thought throughout the process. During the process, learners were encouraged to think beyond lower levels of thinking: remembering. Several students visualized their word knowledge by using prefixes and suffixes; others categorized confusing words, such as take, cost, and spend; and still others conceptualized words with different meanings. It implied that learners formed their vocabulary concepts by constructing new and previous word experiences. It appears that learners moved away from memorizing target words, their meanings, and spellings and displayed positive results, which were also consistent with results from the posttest and delayed posttest. Such an approach helps EFL learners who had little or no exposure to the target language.

The control group, on the other hand, was taught vocabulary using the traditional paper-pencil method, which may have added to their burden. A paper learning method also limited their ability to expand their thinking. That is, it is more important to teach students how to utilize tech apps to learn than to give them digitalized materials.

A minority of participants, however, argued that the MALL app was not necessarily useful for them, which is in accordance with Luef et  al. (2020) and Rosell-Aguilar (2018). There may be different reasons for different minorities. Further interviews with these minorities should be conducted. These findings were similar to what Chwo et  al. (2018) concluded in their meta-analysis of 213 MALL studies: a substantial gap between the ideal way MALL devices should be used and the way they are actually used. Another interesting issue to explore is that MALL is mainly used in a short-term rather than long-term manner as stated by the participants in Chwo et  al. (2016). Individual differences in vocabulary learning might explain the responses of minor respondents to the self-report questionnaire. Learning styles, for example, might influence the results. Those issues, therefore, merit further investigation.

Last but not least, thinking is crucial to language learning (Li, 2016). In order to develop higher-order thinking skills, learners need inquiry-based learning environments (Yulianti et  al., 2018). As French and Rhoder (1992, p. 10) denoted “On the other hand, we must consider whether the lack of a precise definition of thinking may have in fact, contributed to a broader, more creative look at the operation of this fundamental human activity and at our roles as teachers in promoting it and even allowing it to happen,” the current study explored alternative strategies for improving learners’ vocabulary word knowledge. The current study proposes that thinking serves as the catalyst for engaging learners in deep learning through their own learning experiences. Based on Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et  al., 1956), the study sought to assist EFL learners to move beyond lower-level thinking (remember and understand) to higher-level thinking: to identify, classify, explore, collect, to have self-constructed word knowledge output, to visualize learning as well as to promote word retention, and to reflect and evaluate throughout vocabulary learning processes. According to the study, a MALL app-led productive learning approach triggers students’ language thinking, enabling them to engage in word mining using mobile technology using the mind mapping MALL app.

# 7.  Conclusions and future works

The study was motivated by the idea that word knowledge could be enhanced through a mind mapping MALL app that is interactive and adaptive, and it also examined the perspectives of students. A recent study looks at how mind mapping MALL apps can assist students in learning vocabulary, which indirectly affects their learning. Learning words with MALL should not degenerate, which digitalizes traditional learning into mobile devices. As a result, English teachers are facilitators rather than technology inculcators. Through brain-stimulating mind mapping MALL practices and the use of a mind mapping MALL app, the teachers help English learners achieve their learning goals. In this way, the student and teacher roles are reversed; the students are more empowered. The relationship between teachers and students can also be improved by such an approach, since they are more like companions of knowledge seekers. Feeling relaxed, they are willing to explore what they do not know with their companions. Furthermore, teachers should be open-minded to accept unplanned situations in language classes and be prepared to deal with challenges students may present. Although such a learning approach would take time and effort, it would be worth it in the end.

In addition to technology, pedagogy should also keep pace with: “One step ahead for the technology, two steps back for the pedagogy,” (Mioduser et  al., 1999, p. 233) emphasizing the need for language teachers to reduce the discrepancy between MALL tools and learning strategies. EFL learners have limited exposure to the target language (de Carvalho Filho et  al., 2009). To fully engage students in MALL vocabulary learning, they must also be given the option of developing their own word knowledge beyond repetition and drilling. Otherwise, MALL is merely a digitalized version of traditional pedagogy and learning.

There is evidence that teaching pedagogies influence learners’ learning and performance (Mortimore, 1999). A teacher’s pedagogical guidelines can significantly impact students’ inquiry-based learning (Lazonder & Harmsen, 2016). While inquiring, learners are required to think. Learners develop their metacognitive abilities and are encouraged to inquire, discover, analyze, and build their own knowledge through thinking (Bruner, 1961). When learning strategies and results are inextricably linked, meeting learners’ needs is challenging. Mind mapping tools can be used to enhance learners’ cognitive thinking skills. The use of mind mapping as a learning tool stimulates learners’ critical thinking skills and develops their metacognition (Fuad et  al., 2017; Khodadady & Ghanizadeh, 2011; Swestyani et  al., 2018; Wale & Bishaw, 2020). The use of adaptive and constructive learning approaches combined with portable technology has led to more and more recognition that the intervention enhances learning.

Despite the limitations of the current study, first, it would be worthwhile to investigate learners’ self-directed learning in order to achieve optimal learning outcomes (García et  al., 2019). Self-directed learning may also be a powerful influencer in the acquisition of vocabulary in MALL. In addition, several students in the experimental group noted they strongly agreed or disagreed with these points: getting involved, paying better attention, being relaxed, feeling more confident, preferring mind mapping apps to traditional approaches, and proceeding to retaining more words. In the future, qualitative in-depth interviews will be used to investigate personal perceptions in much greater depth, as well as triangulated verification of the results. Third, although there were over 30 participants in this study, the inference statistics are valid to some degree, but we mainly focused on the internal validity rather than the external validity. It is recommended that more participants be included in the future study to increase external validity. Additionally, a future study can be conducted to have a higher external validity by including different teachers to teach both groups. Fourth, while MALLs are proposed to motivate learners to learn, this approach should be handled with caution since motivation levels are different among learners (Ushioda, 2013); therefore, more research is needed to understand what kind of motivation learners possess. The lack of a professional learning motivation scale was one of the limitations of this study. The fifth issue is that although mind mapping apps can be beneficial for vocabulary learning, learners with varying learning styles draw their mind maps in different ways; analyzing their mind mappings may also be needed in order to understand vocabulary learning.

In summary, the purpose of this study is to elucidate the need for alternate mind mapping app learning methods in vocabulary learning via MALL apps, particularly for EFL learners with little exposure to the target language. While flipping our classrooms is a trend, we shouldn’t just flip our learning materials to the digital medium. The interactive relationship between technology and learners is intricate; learners must also be taken into consideration when using MALL technology, since they are on the move as well (Sharples et  al., 2005). That is, the best way to help learners learn a language is to help them learn in it rather than learning about it.
