In this study, a training program, which aimed to develop pre-service teachers' digital competences, was designed. After the training, pre-service teachers' opinions in terms of digital competence development, how they planned to use the digital competence knowledge and skills that they gained in the training program for their future professional careers, and pros and cons of the training were examined. The training was conducted as a case study that involved 24 pre. service teachers. The pre-service teachers were provided $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 7 0 h }$ of training on five competence areas of DigComp. Diaries and focus group interviews were used as data collection tools. The researchers followed two-phased qualitative data analysis procedure. Deductive and inductive analysis techniques were used. The results indicated that pre-service teachers should be trained for information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety and problem solving. In addition, digital competence trainings should be given in a way to include knowledge and practice about professional engagement, digital resources, teaching and learning, assessment and empowering learners. The study revealed that it is necessary for the digital competence trainings to be implemented effectively in which pre-service teachers collaborate on digital issues regardless of their previous experience. In addition, trainers should structure their courses so that pre-service teachers can see them as role models, and theoretical information as well as the possibility of learning by doing should be offered.

# 1. Introduction

Digital competence is sen as a pre-requisite skil for fully and actively joning modern-day information societies and economies, and for coping with social and economic changes as individuals. Therefore, many countries are developing national and international policies in order to improve and support digital competences (Siddi, Hatlevik, Olsen, Throndsen, & Scherer, 2016; Vuorikari, Punie, arreter-Gome, & van Brnde, 2016). Dete  the inities and efforts, thr rediffenes in studnt dtl metences development (Gudmundsdottir, 2010). The need for digitally compatible teachers increases day by day in order to improve students digital competences and to use digital technologies in learning-teching proces efectively (Insteford & Munthe, 2017; Ng, 2012; Ramirez-Montoya, Mena, & Rodriguez-Arroyo, 2017; Redecker, 2017). In the PISA report, it is mentioned that educators who are responsible for the education of the new millenium students should be able to guide the students with digital technologies in their journey of education. The pre-service teachers need to be equipped with digital competences as well s their pedagogical competences in their rofessional carers in order to be actively incuded in diitl socties (Insteford & Munthe, 2017). In this respect, pre-service trainings are important to improve pre-service teachers' digital competences (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], 2017).

# 1.1. Digital competence

Many concepts such as digital competence, media literacy, digital literacy, information literacy have emerged as a result of the rapid development of technology in many fields (Hatlevik & Christophersen, 2013). This is due to the fact that definitions are easily affected by rapidly changing and developing technological developments (Tmte, 2015). Although the definitions are not separated from each ther by sharp boundarie, they have their own characteristics. Digital literacy i usually confused with digital competence. However, \*to be digitally literate is the ability to make and share meaning in different modes and formats, to create,collaborate and communicateffctively (Hague & Payton, 2010, p. 2). Pettrsson (2018) states that digital competence often refer to the skills and literacies needed for the average citizen to be able to learn and navigate in digitlized knowledge society (p. 2). In general, the term digital competence' is used in teacher education and economics, and digital literacy is used in health and arts (Spante, Hashemi Lundin, & Algers, 2018). Today, since the asessment and evaluation is based on competence rather than subject, experts consider the use of digital competence definition as appropriate (Ilomaki, Paavola, Lakkala, & Kantosalo, 2016).

"Digital Competence is the set of knowledge, kills ttitudes, abilities, strategies, and awarenes that are required when using ICT and digital media to perform tasks solve problems; communicate; manage information; collaborate; create and share content; and build knowledge effectively, efficiently, apropriately, criticall, creatively, autonomously, flexibly, ethically, reflectively for work, leisure, participation, learning, and socializing" (Ferrari, 2012, p.30).

As understood from the definitions, digital competence is a broader concept than technical skils and acomplex concept that in. cludes many skils such as cognitive, emotional, and sociological knowledge to use digital environments effectively (Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2014). The critical and reflective use of technology in building new knowledge is emphasized (Instefjord, 2014). Digital competece is muldmesional, complex, rela to 1st cenury sills and ensitie o ocio-ltral isues (Calani, Ctli, Fini, & Ranieri, 2008).

# 1.2. Theoretical framework

Until now, several frameworks or models have been used in order to study digital competence (Calvani et al., 2008; Janssen et al. 2013; Kelentric, Helland, & Arstorp, 2018; Krumsvik, 2014; Ottestad, Kelentric, & Gudmundsdottir, 2014; International Society for Technology in Education [ISTE], 2017). Although frameworks provide general explanations about digital competence (Instefjord & Munthe, 2016), they do not detail the required characteristics to acquire digital competence (Garcia-Martin & Garcia-Sanchez, 2017). DigComp is one of the most current and extensive frameworks developed (Siddiq et a. 2016). DigComp framework is developed in order to help shape the policies to improve digital competences of citizens at all age groups (Vuorikari et al., 2016). The framework consists of five competence areas (see Table 1) (Ferrari, 2013).

DigCompEdu, on the other hand, categorizes educators digital competences. "As educators face rapidly changing demands, they require an increasingly broader and more sophisticated set of competences than before (Redecker, 2017, p. 4). DigCompEdu focuses on only knowledge, kills and atitudes related to the use of digital technologies in educational environments (Ghomi & Redecker, 2019; Redecker, 2017). DigCompEdu emphasizes that educators, as in the TPACK framework (Mishra & Koehler, 2006), need technological,pedagogical and content knowledge to integrate technology into the learning environments. DigCompEdu provides explanations and areas for pedagogical and professional practices on the integration of technology inteaching and professional career (Ghomi & Redecker, 2019). DigCompEdu suggests six digital competence areas for educators working atall les from the pre-school to university (see Table 1). As pre-service teachers' digital competences are the core of this study, \*faciliating learners' digital competences" area is not the main focus in the offered training and data analysis sections.

# 1.3. Digital competence for pre-service teachers

Pre-service teachers' digital competences diffr from that of other individuals since the focus of pre-service teachers is how digital technology can be used for education (Krumsvik, 2011; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2014). Krumsvik (2011) defines digital competence for pre-service teachers as the proficiency in using digital technologies with good pedagogic-didactic judgments and awareness of implications of these technologies for learning strategies and the digital culture of students. Therefore, it requires expertise. Digital competence includes supporting the learning proessof the students and contributing toall the proesses that led to the configuration of information that is in the definitions (Instefjord, 2014; Krumsvik, 2011).

Pre-service teachers graduate from teacher education programs without having enough digital competence skills (Gill Dalgarno, & Carlson, 2015; Gudmundsdotti & Halevik, 2018; Tondeur, van Braak, Sidiq, & Scherer, 2016). There are discrepancies in the digital demand pre-service teachers can fac in their professional careers and the digital technolog trainings they rceive i their education (Krumsvik, 2014). The digital competences pre-service teachers experience in thir teacher education programmes eventuall affect the way they use digital technologies for their own teaching (Agyei & Voogt, 2011), that is why researchers advocate that teacher education programmes should be concentrated on digital competences (Gudmundsdottir & Hatlevik, 2018; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2014).

Studies regarding the digital improvement of pre-service teachers indicate that pre-service teachers feel inadequate in integrating digital technologies with learning-teaching proceses (Instefjord & Munthe, 2017). Also, they have determined that online learning environments, which aim to improve digital competences, are general teacher-centered and do not allow active engagement and interaction among pre-service teachers (Ranieri, Bruni, & Kupiainen, 2018; Tomte, Enochsson, Buskqvist, & Karstein, 2015). Studies have identified that teacher educators do not share enough experiences, examples, or strategies that can potentially make them role models in teacher training programmes; and pre-service teachers experience passive, theoretical information about digital technol. ogies (Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016). It is emphasized that suficient emphasis is not made on pedagogical competences where the technical uses of digital technologies are focused on teacher education programmes (Ranieri & Bruni, 2018; Ranieri et a., 2018)

In the digital competence tranings, practice opportunitie, in which pre-service tachers can actually design activities using digital technologie, should be offered (Gudmundsdottr, 2010; Rkenes & Krumsvik, 2016; Tondeur et al, 2012). Studies also show tht it is necessary to make critical evaluation of appropriate use of digital technologies (Gudmundsdottir & Hatlevik, 2018; Instefjord & Munthe, 2017; Tondeur et al., 2012). Besides, the importance of developing materials related to fields of the pre-service teachers is expressed (Ranieri & Bruni, 2018; Ranieri et al., 2018; Tondeur, Aesaert, Prestridge, & Consuegra, 2018). Researchers cam that pre-service teachers feedback given to their peers on how they can use digital technologies in their fields strongly increases their awareness (Aesaert, Tondeur, & Sidiq, 2018; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016; Tondeur et al., 2018). They argue that pre-service teachers should work with other pre-service teachers who have a higher or similar level in digital competence in order to improve their digital competences (Instefjord, 2014; Liu, Tsai, & Huang, 2015; ondeur e al., 2012; Tondeur, Krsha, Vanderlinde, & van Braak, 2013). In addition, they emphasize that trainers should be role models with the strategies, model practices and experiences they use for the improvement of digital competences (Aesaert e a., 2018; Instefjord & Munthe, 2017; Tmte et al., 2015; Tondeur et al. 2012, 2018) Besides, it is mentioned that itis important to give feedback to pre-service teachers continuously about the performed practices during trainings (Banas & York, 2014; Ranieri & Bruni, 2018; Tondeur et al., 2012, 2018).

# 1.4. Motivation and purpose of the study

When studies were examined, it was observed that the studies were conducted in order to determine pre-service teachers perception of diital comptence and t reeal how effectie techer traning is in developing pre-service teachers digital competences (Instefjord & Munthe, 2017; Ranieri & Bruni, 2018; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016). The qualit oftrainings that should be given in order to develop pre-service teachers digital competences (Instefjord & Munthe, 2017; Ranieri & Bruni, 2018; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016), and opinions of pre-service teachers on how these trainings can be reflected in their professional careers were included only in a few studies. There are studie carried out without considering all dimensions of pre-service teachers' digial competences. However, in the studies, researchers emphasized that we need more studies including digital competence training for pre-service teachers (Ramirez-Montoya et al., 2017; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2014; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016; Tomte et al., 2015). Considering such a need, a training that aims to develop pre-ervice teachers digital competences was designed in thistudy. The main focus of the training was to assure that pre-rvice tachers worked with peers who had different kinds of experience about digital technologies.In this context, they were given activities which allowed them to participate actively and learn through experience, trainers structured their courses in a certain way so that they could be role models for the pre-service teachers, and the prepared content was evaluated by trainers and peers. It is expected that this study will guide pre-service teachers, who willbe teachers of the future in the schoos, on how digital competence training should be and that it willcontribute to their professional careers and to the field of education in general. Accordingly, the research questions are as follows:

1. What are the opinions of pre-service teachers in terms of digital competence development after the training?   
2. How do pre-service teachers planto use the digital competence knowledge and skills they obtained from the training in thir future professional careers?   
3. What do pre-service teachers think about the pros and cons of digital competence training?

# 2. Method

In this study, a qualitative research design, case study, was used. According to Yin (2003), case study \*copes with the technically distinctive situation in which there willbe many more variables of interest than data points, and as one result, rele on multiple source of evidence, with data needing to converge in a triangulating fashion, as another result, benefits from prior development of theoretical propositions to guide data collection and analysis" (p. 13-14).

# 2.1. Study design

This study was designed as a training in which DigComp framework was is foundation and it aimed to develop and support digital competences of pre-service teachers. Within this framework, pre-service teachers had $^ { 7 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ of training in five modules. The training included $^ { 3 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ theoretical and $^ { 4 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ applied courses. These modules were: a) information and data literacy, b) communication and collaboration, c) digital content creation, d) safety, e) problem-solving. Digital competence training was implemented as face-to-face The training was completed in a week. The training was given by 11 trainers in the fields of instructional technologies psychological counseling and guidance (PCG), science and technology. In the information and data litracy module, information is presented to pre service teachers about search engine dataase, srching information, iltering and selcting b using onine libraries ealuatin the validity and reliability of information, the site extensions of which can be accessed, and storing and organizing information by using Drive and Dropbox cloud technologies. In the communication and collaboration module, information is given on subjects such as digital identities formed in different social media platforms and the reflection of these identitie on real life, communicating and interacting through technologies such as Google Hangout, Skype, Gmail, etc. working collaboratively with Google Doc, Slides et., sharing information and content through educational social networks, the rules to be followed in digital environments and quoting. In the digital content creation module, explanations are made to pre-service teachers on copyrights and licensing, animated presentations by using web 2.0 tols, creating educational video, digital story, concept map, etc. integrating and re-elaborating digital content, and the principles of mesage design. Algorithm logic and programming information is given, and Scratch and Alice are introduced. In order to track the development of students by the asessment and evaluation modules of educational social networks (Google Classroom, Edmodo) and web 2.0 tools such as Kahoot are introduced. In the safety modul, presentations are made on the threats that can come from digital technologies and toos, the protection methods, situations threatening privacy and protection methods, and technology and intenet addiction. In the problem solving module, pre-service teachers are shown how they can find solutions for the technical problems they face in digital environments. During the training, pre-ervice teachers were iven information about how they could integrate this information in education and presented sample cases. Afterwards, pre-service teachers were asked to form groups of three pre-service teachers, making sure that at least one pre-service teacher in each group was experienced in terms of digital technologies and their use in education. In each module, pre-service teachers were encouraged to collaborat with their fellow group members, to put the theoretical information into practice, and to exchange ideas on how they could use the information they obtained in their own fields. In this regard, pre-service teachers were asked to work with their fllow group members and tocreate an infographic, a mind map, an interactive video, and an animated presentation about a specific topic in their field. The practices were performed in a computer laboratory which had an internet connection. Each group presented their content to ajury consisting of four instructional technology trainers. The trainers evaluated the digital contents edagogicall and offerd fdback In this proces, each group presented their sudy to the other groups and it was provided that they could give reflections by evaluating the products of the groups. During this process utimate attention was paid to make sure that pre-service teachers presented their activities and shared experiences that integrated digital competence knowledge and skils with their profession. The design of the study can be summarized in Fig. 1.

# 2.2. Participants

The study was conducted with 24 pre-service teachers who were studying in 16 universities and volunteered to participate in this study. More than half of the pre-service teachers were majoring in science education $[ \mathtt { n } = 1 4 ]$ . The rest of the pre-service teachers were majoring in Computer Education and Instructional Technologies (CEIT) $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ , PCG $( \mathbf { n } = 1 )$ ) and Turkish language $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { n } = 1 \dot { } .$ . There were 16 female and 8 male pre-service teachers. Nine of the pre-service teachers were 3rd year students, and 15 of them were 4th year students. With the exception of one pre-service teacher who was 33 years old, the age of the rest of the pre-service teachers ranged between 21 and 25 $( M e a n = 2 2 . 9 1$ $S D = 2 . 3 2 $ . The participants were coded as "P1, P2, ..., P24". The pre-service teachers, who were studying at CEIT, were more experienced than those from other departments due to the education they had received on digital technologies.

# 2.3. Data collection tools

Diaries and focus group interviews were used to get information about pre-service teachers' opinions in terms of digital competence development and how they planned to use these knowledge and skill in thir future professional careers. Pre-service teachers were asked various open-ended questions for each module and were asked to keep diaries. Afer the completion of each module, pre-ervice teachers were asked to write diaries related to that module. Pre-service teachers were asked the following questions: How do you plan and manage the process while looking for online information?", \*For what purposes do you plan to use alications such as Google Calendar, Gmail, Edmodo and Google Classroom in your professional career?", How do you evaluate your competence in terms of creating digital content?", How can prearing digital ontent contribute to your professonal career ?", \*What are the threats you may encounter in the context of personal safety and privacy in digital evironments?", \*What precautions will you take to address these threats?", "Do you think that you can overcome the problems you may encounter in digital environments with the information you have obtained?". In this way, 30 questions were given to pre-service teachers. Pre-service teachers were asked to reflect on their experiences for each module in the light of these questions.

After the completion of the training, focus group interviews were conducted with the participants. The focus group interviews were carried out as semi-structured interviews with groups of four or five. Focus group interviews were preferred because they are inter active and effective in revealing a holisti view (Gibbs, 2012). During the fous group interviews, the ollowing questions were askedto the pre-service teachers: \*How do you evaluate the training in terms of improving your digital competence?", "How do you plan to use the information you learned in your professional career?", Concerning information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem solving, which of the knowledge and skills were developed by the training?" A pilot study was carried out with three pre-service teachers who had qualifications similar to the participants in order to review and modify the focus group interview questions. Each focus group interview lasted in about an hour. Five focus group sessions were held.

# 2.4. Data analysis

The data obtained from the diaries and focus group interviews were analyzed with MAxQDA 2018 software. Analyses were made by two researchers. The researchers followed two-phased qualitative data analysis procedure. Deductive and inductive analyses were used together in the study in order to discover the opinions of pre-service teachers in terms of digital competence development and how they predicted to use the digital competence knowledge and skill they obtained from the training in their future professional careers.

In the first phase, deductive analysis was used. In this form of analysis, it was determined whether the theory the researchers described or created was in accordance with the assumptions (Thomas, 2006). The researchers checked whether there were enough data on the existing themes based on the grounded theory (Creswell, 2013). DigComp framework was used as an analytical lens in order to determine pre-service teachers' opinions in terms of digital competence development, and DigCompEdu framework was used as an analytical lens in order to find out how they plan to use the knowledge and skill they obtained in the training in their future professional carer. At this stage, primarily focus group interviews were transcribed. The data obtained from focus group interviews and diaries were examined by taking into account the areas and sub-competences pecified in DigComp and DigCompEdu. The number of pre-service teachers who expressed their opinions about each theme, sub-themes and codes were presented as tables.

In the second phase, inductive analysis was used. In inductive analysis, analysis process was not built on a theory or framework, but instead it was identified through the data (Brownlee, Scholes, Walker, & Johansson, 2016). In this context, transcribed focus group interviews and diaries were repeatedy read and compared. Similar ideas and thoughts were grouped and coded under similar themes. The number of pre-service teachers who expressed their opinions about each theme and codes were presented as tables.

Three months after the completion of the data analyses, to check whether the data coding was done consistently in accordance with DigComp and DigCompEdu competence areas and to avoid researcher biases, the themes, sub-themes, and codes were revisited by the researchers (Noble & Smith, 2015). Afer this stage, coefficient of consistency between the researchers was found to be 0.86 (McHugh, 2012).

# 3. Results

3.1. The opinions of pre-service teachers in terms of digital competence development

Competence areas, concerning each DigComp area, which pre-service teachers thought they improved after the digital ompetence training, are presented in Table 2 according to the undergraduate programs pre-service teachers were registered.

# 3.1.1. Information and data literacy

In terms of the information and data literacy area, it is understood that one pre-service teacher in PCG, Turkish language, and most of pre-service CT and cience teachers have shown development in Navigation, search, and fltering of information, data, and digital content" sub-competence. They acquired knowledge and skills about reaching digital content from various sources, planning the searching proces, and using specific searching strategies. For \*Storage and retrieval of information, data and digital content" sucompetence, two CEIT and five science pre-service teachers mentioned that they gained experience in storing information in digital environments. As for Evaluation of information, data and digital content sub-competence, it was determined that pre-service science teachers realized that information might not be reliable onthe intenet. Some pre-service science teachers, and one pre-service teacher in CEIT, PCG and Turkish language made sure websites were certified, and they werecareful about website add-ons. Some pre-service teachers' comments with related to these are given below:

"I also learned how to do search, and that searching should be done from various sources. I found out that not ll the information is reliable or correct." (P17, Focus group interview)

"When doing rearch (..) I used to copy the question word by word, wit t on the internet, try to find i and lot a lot of tme this way. (...) For example, I learned what $+ , - , O R ,$ quotation marks mean. Truthfully, when searching for information (...) I used to write words that came into my mind and expected themto appear. I clicked onthe firs thing inf, ec. that appeared, you know. 21, Focus group interview)

# 3.1.2. Communication and collaboration

In terms of the communication and collaboration area, with regard to Digital identity management' sub-competence, the data showed that almost all f the pre-service teachers showed improvement especially in creating a safe digital identity in social media platforms. Two pre-service cience teachers, and one pre-service teacher in CEIT and PCG started to understand better that every share or like they did on digital environments was actually saved. For "Share information and content" sub-competence, it was determined that one pre-service PCG teacher, and the majority of pre-service CEIT and science teachers made a progress in using cloud tech. nologies for information and content sharing. In terms of "Collaboration through digital channels" sub-competence, more than half f pre-service science teachers, one pre-service PCG, and two pre-service CEIT teachers were reported to obtain knowledge on the features of collaborative work aplications. Pre-service CEI, science and PCG teachers obtained the knowledge and experience to choose the best too for collaborative work. In the sub-competence of "Interaction through digital technologies", the datalso revealed that half of pre-service science teachers and a few pre-service CEIT, PCG, and Turkish language teachers had gained knowledge in communicating viadifferent technologies. As for Netiquette" sub-competence, some pre-service science teachers revealed that they should be mindful of providing reference while sharing information on digital environments. Several pre-service CEIT and science teachers stated that they have learned about the behavioral norms in digital environments. Some pre-service teachers comments related to these are given below:

"I wanted to login and check my Facebook account. I found out that what I would share was sen publicly. I immediately changed the privacy settings to share my profile with my friends only. People share their locations. It means that they are away from home. I beliee that such hings should not be shared. very wsite wevist ey tton we click reus n r dgl idnttie, inrets, politiclviews, religion to be saved and ends up feeding us with advertisements." (P2, Focus group interview)

"In the past, we used to say you do this and Ill do this in group projects. We had no clue about what a friend was doing. And my friends didn't know what was doing. But with Google Doc and slide, I can view what my friend is writing as he types in. My friend can also see what I write and we have the change to create a chat on a side bar and talk whenever we want. " (P9, Focus group interview)

# 3.1.3. Digital content creation

In terms of digital content creation area, with regard to Development of digital content" sub-competence, one pre-service teacher in PCG and Turkish language and most of pre-service science teachers reported to be competent in creating infographics, animated presentations, and educational videos. Half of the pre-service CEIT teachers expressed that they had developed themselves on infographics and animated presentations. A few of pre-service science teachers obtained knowledge and experience in creating digital stories and mind maps. For Copyright and licenses" sub-competence, it was identified that one pre-service teacher in PCG and Turkish language, l pre-service CE teachers and most of pre-service science teachers grasped the importance of intellectual property rights and licensing. A few pre-service CEIT and science teachers mentioned that they could develop contents appropriate for copyrights. In "Programming" sub-competence, more than half of the pre-service CEIT teachers and some pre-service science and PCG teachers grasped the algorithm logic. Some pre-service teachers' comments related to these are given below:

"With Edpuzzle, we can add audio recording at specific point of a video; or we can add a question and thus, I think it i very useful to receive feedback from students." (P9, Focus group interview)

"Ultimately, we use a product without repecting the copyrights. This is not only against the digital ethics of conduct but also against social thics of conduct. We expect to get appreciation in retu for even the smallest eforts. So, I belie instead of using methods like cracking, we should get it license or even if we don't, we can contact its owner and get permission by telling him/her where we will use it." (P10, Diary)

"Scratch block, together with coding, helped us prepare games and simulations. I think that in our professonal carers, we can create beautiful products with the help of interdisciplinary collaborative work." (P16, Diary)

# 3.1.4. Safety

In terms of safety area, with regard to Protection of personal data and digital identity" sub-competence, it was determined that all of the pre-service teachers obtained knowledge and experience in taking precautions to protect personal information and in knowing the legal proces of privacy act. Moreover, i was identified that one pre-service teacher in PG and Turkish language, and the majority of pre-service CEIT and science teachers have become aware of personal riss and threats on digital environments. Concerning the sucompetence of "Protection of devices and digital content, pre-service Turkish language teacher, and a vast majority of pre-service CEIT and science teachers became aware of risks and threats that may come from digital devices. Most of pre-service teachers gained experience and knowledge in taking precautions to protect digital devices. During the training, we realized that pre-service teachers obtained knowledge and experience in using modems safely and configuring computer networks, both of which were used against threats that might come from digital devices. As for the sub-competence of "Protection of health and well-being", the data revealed that few pre-service science teachers became aware of taking precautions to protect personal information. Some pre-service teachers' comments related to these are given below:

"In our country, applications are made with the 5651 Intenet Law number. After the application is evaluated in the first stage, it is nsured that the necessary data are examined by Personal Data Protection Authorit. f the claim is justified, the data will be removed." (P8, Diary)

"I didn nw that cookies could be deed utomaticall. lend that Normall, I deet i manually every day. As for safety it is the first time that I heard images are taken using the camera and people are blackmailed." (P2, Focus group interview)

"We can sucesfull prevent unlicensed software, cracks, and cyber-attacks. You know how a programme that you download spreads virus. By taking necessary precautions using seings and not using crack programmes, open windows on hidden tabs. It i necessary that microphone and camera on the technological devices should be turned off." (P17, Diary)

# 3.1.5. Problem-solving

"We can quickly connect students with the help of virtual classoom applications (.. I saw that we can share our knowledge on virtul platforms, too and do activities there." (P24, Diary)

# 3.2.2. Digital resources

In terms of "Creating and modifying digital resources" sub-competence, pre-service PCG, and Turkish language teachers, and the majority of pre-service CEIT and science teachers stated that they would use their experience for developing digital content appropriate to the goals, and pay attention to message design in content development. Two pre-service CEIT teachers and one pre service PCG teacher would use their experience for paying attention to the consistencies between applied teaching method and the digital resource. Concerning the sub-competence "Selecting digital resources', it was revealed that a pre-service Turkish language teacher, and a good part of pre-service CET and scienceteachers thought they could use their knowledge and experience in evaluating the effectiveness validit and reliablity of the existing digital resources they found. As for Managing, protectig and sharing digtal resources" sub-competence, the data revealed that some pre-service science teachers wil use their knowledge and experience in their future classes and pay attention to provide reference while sharing information, and they will develop content appropriat to intellectual property rights. Some of the comments of pre-service teachers with regard to these are given below:

"Mind maps form the most important parts of a topic, so it can quickly stick in someone's mind. Learning by practice and fun, and visudl memory is aso important. They can be used as astrategy in the system of education, but it i not preferred much at the present time. I think infographic i beter and more sophisticaed compared to mind map. The visuals on the background re richer and it can be adapted for any topic." (P19, Diary)

# 3.2.3. Teaching and learning

In terms of the sub-competence Teaching" it was found that more than half of the pre-service science and PCG teachers, and pre service Turkish language teachers are planning to use the knowledge and experience while organizing interactive learning-teaching activities. For "Collaborative learning" sub-competence, the data also revealed that almost half of the pre-service CEIT teachers are planning to organize collaborative learning-teaching activities. As for "Self-regulated leaning" sub-competence, the analysis showed that only one pre-service CEIT teacher is planning to use this knowledge and experience while displaying students' projects. Some of the comments of pre-service teachers regarding to these are given below:

Activities in which we make our students use these tools can be organized. Just ike what done to us. Here, I have ideas on what kind o activities can be created." (P3, Interview)

"I can onsidr using ationl soc ntworks. I is beause  belie the activities and assigments are more prouctive when thy are done collaboratively in the classroom." (P2, Diary)

# 3.2.4. Assessment

In terms of "Assessment strategies'" sub-competence, it was found that one pre-service PCG teacher, and more than half of pre service science teachers are planning to asess student knowledge and performance by using the knowledge and skill they had obtained. The data revealed that one pre-service PCG teacher and some pre-service science teachers are planning to use their experience in order to structure assgnments and tasks. As for "Feedback" sub-competence, the results also showed that pre-service Turkish anguage teachers and nearly half of pre-service science teachers are going to use their experience for monitoring students behavior and for offring feedback through digital technologies. Some of the comments of pre-service teachers concerning these are given below:

"For example, I relly likd Edmodo.  ln to use it for ll my exams. .) Interaction can e formed wth students through lssroom and feedback can be given. Also, with the help of Class Dojo application that we learned today, required reinforces can be given to students." (P11, Diary)

(P23, Focus group interview)

# 3.2.5. Empowering learners

In terms of "Accessibility" sub-competence, it was identified that pre-service PCG, and Turkish language teachers and the majority of pre-service CEIT and science teachers are going to utilize the knowledge they obtained for storing and organizing materials for courses, and use them in order to facilitate accessto resources. As for Actively engaging learners, the results showed that one preservice teacher in PCG and Turkish language, and almost all of pre-service science teachers are planning to use their knowledge to make sure that students lean while having fun. The data also revealed that more than half of pre-service science teachers are planning to use these with the purpose of drawing students attention. On the other hand, pre-service PCG, and Turkish language teachers, and nearly half of pre-service science teachers thought they could utilize these in engaging students actively, providing motivation and structuring the content in a way that would increase the retention of the information. Some of the comments of pre-service teachers

with regard to these are given below:

"I can prepare games on science topics using Scratch. It is because games increase motivation by atracting attention of the students during the lessons." (P20, Diary)

"We can reach students quickly using a virtual classroom application. At the same time, I realized that sometimes we can share our knowledge and do activities in virtul environments and that i doen't have to be wthi four wll, or just in chools or classooms (..) Onthe topic that I teach, I can create xercises nd activities beforehand, share them with my students for reinforcement, and of course, do a follow-up." (P24, Focus group interview)

"e creatd a clsroom seing.  rell liked ls dojo (badges, symbols) we can use t as digtl portfoli.) It wllhelp me store documents like tests, quizzes and exams that I will apply to my students." (P22, Focus group interview)

# 3.3. Pros and cons

The pre-service teachers were asked to pecify pros and cons of the given training in order to clearly draw the boundaries of digital competence training that could possibly be given. Pre-service teachers opinions on the advantages and limitations of the training they received are presented in Table 4.

When Table 4 is examined i is determind that pre-service teachers self-confidence in the use f technology has increase with the help of applications in the training. Collaborating with experienced pre-service teachers improved their knowledge and skills. The presentation of applications that aimed to develop content in a short period of time made them believe that digital content could be developed easily. Offering a chance to put the theoretical information into practice improved their knowledge and skills In addition, pre-service teachers statd that the trainers were role model for them in terms of using digital technologie in education and the given training had advantages in terms of learning from a peer and receiving feedback after activities. Here are some of the pre-service teachers' comments regarding these findings:

"I can say the ways trainers taught ffcted me. It is because each trainer with different activitie nd a diffeent style impressed me. Otherwise, I dlready knew the information about the topics. For me, it was just renforcement. Trainers styles were new experience for me. (.. I peronally examined the trainers' activities. I ook note of what kind of actvities they desiged and how they enacted them." (P1, Focus group interview)

"Collaboration of two pre-service science teachers and one pre-service CEIT teacher was reall effective. Seriously, neither three pre service science teachers nor three pre-service CEIT teachers could create those contents. Even though pre-service CEIT teachers are technically competent, the content wouldn't have been so efficient if there had been only pre-ervice CEIT teachers. " (P16, Diary)

When Table 4 is examined, it is observed that pre-service teachers stated that the training period was tooshort, and they allocated too much time for topics that pre-service teachers were already familiar with, which were the cons of the trainings. Some pre-service teachers mentioned an additional limitation stating that technical topics were not addressed that much. Here are some of the pre. service teachers' comments regarding these findings:

"Trainers could have shown what could be done withit in the robotics field. They could have at least created awareness by bringing in a 3D printer and could have said guys, we can also produce materials like this'. For science teachers, they could have said you can build a 3D model of an organ like this" (P3, Focus group interview)

"The training time for those was really short. For example, we started realizing one idea, then we changed our idea, but we couldn't follow up on our second idea because we thought we couldn't finish it on time. f study time had been longer, I think much beter digital content would have been presented." (P21, Focus group interview)

# 4. Discussion and conclusions

# 4.1. Pre-service teachers' opinions in terms of digital competence development

Pre-service teachers were observed to develop themselves in "Information and data literacy' competence area, in Navigation, search, and filtering of information, data, and digital content", Storage and retrieval of information, data and digital content" and "Evaluation of information, data and digital content" sub-competences. This study concluded that pre-service teachers developed their knowledge and skills n getting diital content from varios sources, planning th searching proces, using specifi serching straes, storing information in digital environments, realizing information may not be reliable, being careful about website extensions and making sure wesites are certfied. Similar to thee results, ebi and Reisoglu (2019 found that, thanks to digitl competece trainng, pre-service teachers have improved in using information searching strategies, accessing information, evaluating the validity and reliability of information, organizing and storing information. Ramirez-Montoya et al. (2017) pointed out that digital competence trainings improved pre-service teachers' skills of searching for information on the web.

Pre-service teachers gained knowledge and skills about Digital identity management, "Share information and content', "Collaboration through digital channels, "Interaction through digital technologies" and "Netiquette" sub-competences which belonged to ommunication and collaboration" competence area. It was concluded that pre-service teachers improved their knowledge and skill in creating a safe digital identity, using cloud technologies for information and content sharing, realizing the characteristics of collaborative work practices and communicatig via different technologies, knowing behavioral norms of the digital environments, being mindful f providing reference when sharing information. In the literature, Napal, Penalva, and Mendioroz (2018) and Siddiq et al. (2016) statd that in Communication and collaboration' area, the focus was usually on issues related to \*Share information and content" and \*Interaction through digital technologies" sub-competences. Gudmundsdottir and Hatlevik (2018) determined that pre-service teachers are not well-equiped in terms of netiquette during their education. However, in this study, pr-service teachers stated that they have made progres in five dimensions of Communication and collaboration competence area. However, pre-service teachers did not expresstheir opinions on \*Citizen participation online' sub-competence. This situation may have stemmed from the fact that sufficient practice related to this sub-competence could not be done because the duration of the study was limited.

Pre-service teachers made progress in Digital content creation" competence area, in Development of digital content, Copyrights and licenses", and \*Programming" sub-competences. It was observed that pr-ervice teachers had not improved their knowledge and skills n Integrating and re-elaborating digitl content" sub-competence area. This situation might have resulted from the fact that preservice teachers preferred developing content from scratch rather than integrating existing digital content. It was concluded that pre service teachers improved their knowledge and skills in the importance of intellctual property rights and licensing, creating info graphics, animated presentations, educational videos, and grasping the algorithm logic. Similarly, Cebi and Reisoglu (2019) found that, thanks to digital competence training, pre-service teachers gained knowledge and experience in developing content in simple form, copyrights and licensing. On the other hand, Rkenes and Krumsvik (2016) found that pre-service teachers o not feel competent in developing different contents and the expectation to develop digital content is much higher than their existing digital competence in the schools where pre-service teachers work as trainees (Instefjord & Munthe, 2017).

Pre-service teachers improved their knowledge and skill in "Safety" competence area, in Protection of personal data and digital identity", "Protection of devices and digital content', "Protection of health and well-being" sub-competences. It was concluded that pre-service teachers developed their knowledge and skils in taking precautions to protect personal information, knowing the legal process of privacy act, being aware of personal riss and threats in digital evironments (cyberbullying, et.) taking precautions to protect digital devices, being aware of riss and threats that may come from other devices. Similarly, Cebi and Reisoglu (2019) determined that thanks to digital competence training, pre-service teachers improved their knowledge and skill in sharing personal information, safety policies for protecting personal information, knowing the appropriate ways to protect digital devices and content and recognizing ris and dangers in the digital environment. Napal et al. (2018) sserted that pre-service teachers had deficiencies in terms of "Protection of personal data and digital identity", Protection of health and well-being", "Protection of the environment" sub-competences of "Safety". In this study, teachers gained knowledge and experience of most sub-competences. However, it was observed that pre-service teachers had not improved their knowledge and skills in "Protection of the environment" sub-competence area. This situation might have resulted from a broader focus on the protection of personal information in the training.

Pre-service teachers acquired knowledge and skils in "Problem-solving' competence area, in Identification of needs and technological answers", "Identification of gaps in digital competence" and "Solving technical problems" sub-competences. It was concluded that pre-service teachers made progressin finding technological solutions as per ther needs, identifying the knowledge and necesities about digital competence, improving knowledge and skill by following the latst developments solving the technical problems faced in digital environments. Similarly, Ng (2012) identified that afer the conducted digital competence trainings, pre-service teachers learned how they could solve the problem encountered and how they would follow the latest developments in digital technologies. Napal et al.(2018) revealed that pre-service teachers had intermediate knowledge regarding \*Solving technical problems" and "Identification of nees and technological answers" sub-competences. However, it was observed that pre-service teachers improved their knowledge and skill i all competences, except Inovation and useof dital tehnology in a creative way' his situation might have arisen from the fact that the time, which was allocated for using digital technologies in a creative way, was not enough for pre-service teachers. In future studies, showing more examples of creative use of digital technologies to pre-service teachers and further practice on this issue may be useful.

# 4.2. Utilization of digital competence knowledge and skills in professional careers

It was found that pre-service teachers are planning to use their experiences for "Organizational communication', Digital continuous professional development" and "Professional collboration" sub-competences with regard to "Professonal Engagement" competence area. The fact that pre-service teachers did not expres any opinions regarding Relective practice" sub-competence might have reulted from the fact that change f ideas among pre-serviceteachers was limited due to the training time. In addition, the results showed that digital competence training for pre-service teachers should be given in a way to include using digital technologies to communicat with colleague, students and parents, execting administratie affars,collaorating wth colleagues, and following the latest devlopments. Inthe literature, it was mphasizdthat communicating through digital technologies in educational insttions is important for administrative affirs (Tomte et al., 2015). Tondeur et al. (2012) have pointed out that presenting and promoting opportunities for collaboration to the pre-ervice teachers via digital technologies is very important for them in terms of sharing their knowledge and experience.

It was identified that pre-service teachers are planing to put the knowledge they obtained into practice in Creating and modifying digital resources", "Selecting digital resources" and Managing, protecting and sharing digital resources" sub-competences categorized under Digtal resources" competence area.It was determined that digital competence training for pre-service teachers should be given in a way to include developing digital content that is appropriat to the goals, evaluating the efectivenes, validity and reliabilit of digital resources, developing content that i appropriatto intellectual propert rights. owever, Gudmunddottir and Hatlevik (2018) found that the teachers do not gt sufficient traning in the contex f their education to enable them to asess digital technologies in terms of compatibility with the subject matter or the group of students, and to develop multimedia materials.

It was determined that pre-service teachers are planning to use their experiences for Teaching", Collaborative learning", and "Self-regulated learning" sub-competences categorized under "Teaching and Learning" competence area. However, that pre-service teachers did not express any opinions regarding "Guidance" sub-competence might have resulted from the fact that sufficient pratice in this subject was not done during the training. It may also be caused by the lack of knowledge and experience of pre-service teachers' learning-teaching methods. The results of this study showed that digital competence training for pre-service teachers should especially be given in a way to include developing interactive learning-teaching activities and organizing collaborative learning-teaching activities. At this point, it was emphasized that showing the pedagogical potential of digital technologies to preservice teachers and including practical activities could give pre-service teachers ideas on how they could use digital technologies for learning-teaching goals (Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016). Although Gudmundsdotir and Hatlevik (2018) pointed out that digital competence trainings do not cover how digital technologie can be used to improve students collaboration skill in teacher education, in this study, pre-service teachers' knowledge and skills in organizing collaborative learning activities improved.

It was observed that pre-service teachers are planning to use the information they obtained in accordance with Assessment strategies" and \*"eedback" sub-competences categorized under "Asessment" competence area. Pre-service teachers did not express any views on Analyzing evidence" sub-competence. The results of this study indicated that digital competence training for pre-service teachers should be given in a way to include assesing students performance, creating assgnments and tasks, and monitoring student behavior and offering fdback. However, it was found that during the course of teacher education, pre-service teachers thought they were not trained to use digital technologies for asessment and evaluation purposes (Gudmundsdotir & Hatlevik, 2018; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016). Rokenes and Krumsvik (2014) highlighted that when pre-service teachers are encouraged to assesstudent gains and performances using the latest technologie instead of traditional methods, it will effective to improve their digital competences as well.

Regarding the competence area of "Empowering Learners', it was specified that pre-service teachers are considering puting "Accessility" and ctively engaging lerners" sub-competences into use The fact that pre-service teachers did not expres any views on Diffeentiation and personalization sub-competence might have esulted from that detaled practice was not done on how digital technologies could be used for different student needs. The results of this study demonstratd that digital competence trainins should be given in a way to include storing and organizing resources, expediting accessto resources, ensuring that students have fun while learning, drawing students attention, actively engaging them during coures, providing motivation, and structuring the content in a way that wil increase the retention of the information. However, Tondeur, Pareja-Roblin, van Braak, Voogt, and Prestridge (2017) found that new teachers do not usually usedigital technologiesto support ertain required skill for students in the 21st century, such as creative and critical thinking.

# 4.3. How should the training process be?

In this study, it was observed that collaboration of experienced and inexperienced pre-service teachers and collaboration with other disciplines was effective in terms of acquiring more knowledge and skill in ashort period of time. Similarl, Ranieri et al. (2018) emphasized that collaborative work during digital competence training has a useful side in terms of the development of pre-service teachers. Caspersen and Raaen (2014) stated that supportive and colaborative work in the professional environment enables pre-service teachers to acquire more knowledge and experience than working individually. Tomte et al. (2015) noted that digital competence trainings, as well as ensuring accessto content, should failitate sharing of experience and learning from each other.

The training given in this study has advantages in terms of developing content in a short period of time, putting theoretical information into practice, and improving and reinforcing previous knowledge. Pre-service teachers were given an opportunity to apply what they learned in this study and which enabled them to form an opinion from different viewpoints on how they can utilize these technologies when they begin to their professonal carers. Similar to these conclusions, it was mentioned that in digital competence trainings, practices related to content development increased satisaction and pre-service teachers would actively use digital technologies and develop products rather than learning th features of digital technologies passively (Ranieri & Bruni, 2018; Ranieri t al., 2018; Rokenes & Krumsvik, 2016). Gill et al. (2015) argued that pre-service teachers should be given an opportunity to observe, reflect, and experience how digital technologies could be used in learning and teaching activities.

In this study, trainers shaped the training so that pre-service teachers could view them as role models. Similar to this conclusion, Rokenes and Krumsvik (2016) asserted that when trainers share their experience on how digital technologie can be used in education, show their strategie, and preent examples, they hae the potential to affect pre-service teachers educationaleffectiveness oulger, Graziano, Schmidt-Crawford, and Slykhuis (2017) stated that trainers should design instruction incorporate pedagogical approaches that prepare pre-service teachers to use technology in their content area efectively. In spite of this, Gudmundsdottir and Hatlevik (2018), and Instefjord and Munthe (2017) determined that trainers fail to be role models for pre-service teachers in the trainings.

It was concluded that courses should be placed in a longer period of time and more time should be devoted to each subject. This situation is rcognized from the lack of comments on some sub-competences such as Citizn participation online", Integrating and reelaborating digitl content, Innovation and use of digital technology in acreative way", Protection of the environment, Reflective practice", \*Guidance, and Differentiation and personalization'. As Ranieri et al. (2018) noted, this situation may result from the fact that pre-service teachers want to get more information about the technical aspects of digital technologies and they desire more time to spare for practice. In addition, they may have thought that time should be longer in order to accomplish the tasks given related to each topic in a er way. t is emphasithat ths illaretht leand kowge an kill ill be intealized beter and will increase the performance in different activities (Pereira, Pinto, & Moura, 2016).

# 5. Limitations and future research

This study has some limitations. The irs limitation is that his study is drawn upon just one \*case' Due to case study, the obtained results could not be generalized. However, theaim of case study method is to evaluate the results inthe current context and generalize them to similar situations instead of generalizing them to the population (Yin, 2003). Another limitation of the study is that the duration of the training was limited to $^ \mathrm { 7 0 h }$ As a matter of fact, in the study, pre-service teachers also found the duration of the training as limited. As digital competence is a very extensive and complex topic, it could be beneficial to extend the duration of the training and to include more application and practices in the future studies. Another limitation of the study is that the data of how pre-service teachers planned to utilize the knowledge they obtained in their professional career were gathered through focus group interviews and diaries. ince the participants were selected from 16 universities, a long-term study was not conducted or observations were not used in order to see how they actuall utilized their knowledge and experience in schools. Therefore, it is eential that long-term, observational studies should be conducted in the future to be able to examine the effects of digital competence training in practice. In this study, the content of ths training is based on DigComp. However, in future studies, training programs can be developed based on DigCompEdu to train pre-service teachers about how touse digitl technologies in education. Similar studies can be carried out with in-service teachers.
