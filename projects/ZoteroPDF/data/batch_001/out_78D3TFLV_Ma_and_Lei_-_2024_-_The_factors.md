# ABSTRACT

This study, rooted in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), investigates the multifaceted factors that influence teacher education students in Information-Based Teaching to embrace artificial intelligence technologies. To enrich the TAM framework, we have incorporated elements such as Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL), Subjective Norms (SN), and Output Quality (OQ), with the aim of examining their respective effects on the willingness of teacher education students to adopt AI technologies. To substantiate this theoretical framework, we conducted empirical research involving teacher education students from various Chinese universities. Our findings affirm the robustness of the TAM in explaining the inclination of teacher education students, engaged in the actual teaching process within a digitized educational environment, to adopt AI technologies. Through this model, our study underscores the pivotal role of Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) in influencing educators’ acceptance of AI technologies, establishing a foundational cornerstone for subsequent explorations within the theoretical landscape of the TAM. In this study, we identify Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) as the primary factors affecting Behavioral Intention (BI) to use AI technologies. Consequently, to foster broader adoption of AI technologies by educators, it is essential to emphasize their tangible benefits and superiority in teaching, with the goal of promoting the extended utilization of AI in digitalized instruction.

# Introduction

With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, its significance in education has been growing exponentially. It serves as a pivotal instrument in information technology-enabled teaching, offering a crucial push for innovative educational developments. In recent years, breakthroughs in areas like deep learning and artificial neural networks have enabled AI to deliver personalized teaching services. These services cater to individual learners’ styles, capabilities, and needs, thus potentially remedying the shortcomings of traditional teaching environments (Chen et al., 2020). AI is rapidly permeating every sector of education, enhancing teaching efficiency, and positively influencing educators’ daily pedagogical tasks. As a result, teachers can now leverage AI to free themselves from tedious, repetitive administrative duties, directing their focus towards essential teaching activities. By analysing learners’ behaviours, AI assists educators in making pedagogical decisions in a collaborative man-machine environment. This has manifested in possibilities such as smart tutoring, personalized learning systems, and intelligent recommendation systems to amplify students’ learning experiences (Ng et al., 2023). Numerous countries and regions, China among them, have implemented policies and made substantial investments to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into education. In China, the Ministry of Education has unveiled guidelines around constructing intelligent learning environments, innovating smart education models, boosting teacher training, and improving educational governance capabilities. This includes the launch of 18 “Smart Education Demonstration Zones” and initiating two phases of “AI-Boosted Teacher Training Pilots”. While policies play a crucial role in influencing educators’ attitudes towards technology integration and innovative teaching (Sang et al., 2011), it’s essential to note that even with substantial state funding, the adoption of new technologies by teachers may not be guaranteed if they are not inherently inclined to do so (Chen et al., 2020). Teacher education students in university are the torchbearers for future teaching roles in the AI era. Acquainted with AI’s unique advantages in tech-enabled teaching, they understand the transformative implications of AI for education more than their traditional counterparts. Thus, exploring factors affecting teacher education students’ willingness to use AI in such a context becomes paramount.

The Digital Technology Domain widely applies the Technology Acceptance Model as a primary theoretical framework. It serves as a common practice for assessing the reception of emerging technological innovations (Lee et al., 2003; Park, 2009). Researchers, Sánchez-Prieto et al. (2019), have introduced conceptual models derived from TAM to evaluate educators’ willingness to embrace AIdriven assessment methods within the realm of e-learning. This contribution effectively addresses a previously unexplored area in the field. Teo and Huang (2019) employed TAM to examine how individual cultural beliefs influence Chinese university teachers’ tech adoption intentions. The results unveiled that the pivotal factors influencing behavioural intent are the perception of utility, subjective norms, one’s attitude towards usage, and cultural factors. Furthermore, the research confirmed the TAM as a robust framework for comprehending the acceptance of technology within the context of Chinese educators. Simultaneously, Agudo-Peregrina et al. (2014) conducted an examination into the determinants of e-learning system acceptance using the TAM model. Their findings identified perceived usefulness and subjective norms as the primary predictors of behavioural intent towards the adoption of e-learning systems. Existing research indicates that TAM can identify barriers and influencers for adopting new tech in specific fields (Al Nahian Riyadh et al., 2009). It’s proven as an effective model, elucidating factors impacting tech adoption intentions among diverse users in various contexts (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Hence, this research, with pre-service teachers from teacher education students as its subject, will employ the TAM to probe into factors influencing the willingness to adopt AI in tech-enabled teaching, subsequently offering feasible recommendations for AI’s future development in this arena.

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) emphasizes Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) as two key predictive factors that clarify behavioural intentions (Mailizar et al., 2021; Szopiński & Bachnik, 2022). Nonetheless, the core aspect of employing TAM to anticipate the behavioural intentions concerning the subject in question hinges on the choice, amalgamation, and recalibration of its fundamental components. As demonstrated in their research, Bazelais et al. (2018) underscore the need for expanding the TAM model in forthcoming studies to yield more precise research outcomes (Bazelais et al., 2018). To more comprehensively capture the influencing factors of new technology use, it is imperative to fully consider external variables. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the prerequisites for intention and usage (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Therefore, in the theoretical model of this study, this paper introduces the subjective norms, one of the social influence processes that Venkatesh and Davis added to TAM2, and the output quality in the tool influence process as external variables of this research model, to better explore the impact of the external environment on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In enhancing guidance for the practical implementation of information systems and further refining the TAM model, multiple studies have demonstrated that experience can modulate the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Experience plays a significant role as a moderating variable within the context of IT adoption. Leveraging the concept of experience, this research introduces the notion of Artificial Intelligence Literacy as an external factor to be integrated into the research model. This adjustment aligns the theoretical framework of this study more closely with the practical context. Building upon this foundation, the research refines the technology acceptance model and formulates a theoretical framework suited for predicting the determinants of teacher education students’ willingness to embrace AI technology in information technology-enabled teaching. The variables include: subjective norms, output quality, artificial intelligence literacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and usage intention, to further understand the willingness of teacher education students to use AI technology in the informatized teaching environment.

To summarize, this study aims to answer two research questions:

Q1: Is TAM sufficient to explain the willingness of teacher education students to use AI technology in an informatized teaching environment?

Q2: Among the many influencing factors, which one has the greatest impact on the willingness of student teachers to use AI technology?

# Literature review

# Technology acceptance model

Conceived by Davis in 1986, TAM has its roots in the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) presented by Fishbein and Ajzen in 1975. TAM comprises fundamental elements, including Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Attitude Towards Use (ATU), and Behavioral Intention (BI). Significantly, Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use assume pivotal roles within TAM. According to Davis et al. (1989), Perceived Usefulness is defined as “the extent to which an individual believes that utilizing a specific system would enhance their job performance”, while Perceived Ease of Use is defined as “the extent to which an individual believes that using a particular system would necessitate minimal effort”. Figure 1 depicts the original representation of TAM.

In the initial renditions of TAM, the model suggested that the impact of Perceived Ease of Use on Behavioral Intention was mediated by its influence on Perceived Usefulness. However, subsequent research has prompted scholars to reassess and modify the original TAM framework. The element known as “Usage Attitude” was excluded from the model, following studies by Davis et al. (1989), Szajna (1996), Venkatesh and Davis (2000), and Yen et al. (2010), which demonstrated its negligible mediating role between Behavioral Intention, Perceived Usefulness, and Ease of Use. Consequently, the TAM model underwent simplification through the removal of the “Usage Attitude” component. This investigation is grounded in the streamlined version of TAM, as depicted in Figure 2. Venkatesh and Davis (2000) highlighted that this refined TAM version might provide enhanced predictive capabilities for user acceptance compared to its precursor. Within this succinct model, Behavioral Intention is directly influenced by Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use.

Figure 2. Simplified TAM model.

Based on the TAM model, the text proposes the following hypotheses:

H7: The perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence technology among teacher education students has a positive impact on their perceived usefulness.

H8: The perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence technology among teacher education students has a positive influence on their behavioural intention to use it.

H9: The perceived usefulness of artificial intelligence technology among teacher education students has a positive impact on their intention to use it.

# Subjective norms

Subjective Norm (SN) is characterized as “an individual’s perception of whether those most significant to them believe they should or should not partake in the particular behaviour” (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). Both the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) formulated by Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) devised by Ajzen (1991) acknowledge subjective norms as a direct influencer of behavioural intention. In 2000, Venkatesh and Davis integrated it into the TAM model. The noteworthy impact of subjective norms on intention, especially in obligatory settings, was unveiled by Hartwick and Barki (1994). TAM2 posits that subjective norms directly affect intention primarily in compulsory system use contexts as opposed to voluntary ones. Taylor and Todd’s influential 1995 study showcased the considerable effect of subjective norms on an individual’s perceived usefulness, a finding consistently reaffirmed in subsequent TAM2 and TAM3 models (Venkatesh & Bala, 2008; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000).

In this study, the subjective norm mainly encompasses recommendations from fellow educators, directives from school leaders, and viewpoints from policies, among other factors, shaping the use of artificial intelligence technology in digital teaching among education students. This primarily reflects the pressure subjects experience from individuals in their environment to utilize artificial intelligence technology. In such a mandatory context, even if they harbour reservations about its use, they will still integrate artificial intelligence technology into digital teaching due to external pressure or potential consequences. Based on the aforementioned findings, this paper puts forth the following hypotheses:

H1: Subjective norms have a positive impact on teacher education students’ intention to use artificial intelligence technology.

H2: Subjective norms positively influence the perceived usefulness of artificial intelligence technology among teacher education students.

# Output quality

Output Quality (OQ) refers to the performance outcomes when people use information technology to carry out tasks. It encapsulates the cognitive process where individuals form judgements on perceived usefulness by comparing what a new technology can achieve and its actual effectiveness when used in tasks. In the TAM2 model, output quality has been shown to positively impact perceived usefulness (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). This notion has been further validated in subsequent studies by various scholars (Fang & Liu, 2017; Ismail et al., 2019). When teachers practically employ artificial intelligence technology for digital teaching, output quality manifests in two aspects. On one hand, it’s about the quality of outputs from the AI technology application itself, that is, the teacher’s value judgement on the outcomes generated by the AI teaching system or other AI technologies. On the other hand, it’s about the value judgement on the degree to which using AI technology enhances teaching effectiveness. Based on the conclusions above, this paper proposes the following hypothesis:

H3: Output Quality positively influences the perceived usefulness of artificial intelligence technology among teacher education students.

# Artificial intelligence literacy

Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) represents a novel digital competence crucial in the age of AI, a proficiency everyone should possess to adapt to this burgeoning era. Traditionally, “Literacy” denotes an individual’s reading and writing skills – a macro-level capability. Once mastered, one gains access to a wealth of information. Technological literacy often describes a person’s aptitude to “utilize computers and other technologies to enhance learning, productivity, and performance” (Moore, 2011). Soon, AIL will emerge as one of the paramount technological proficiencies of the 21st century, given the rapid infiltration of AI technologies across industries, not least in education. According to Bloom’s taxonomy, AIL comprises four main facets: Understanding AI, Applying AI, Evaluating AI, and AI Ethics (Ng et al., 2021).

Within the realm of AIL, “Understanding $\mathsf { A l } ^ { \prime \prime }$ implies the users’ ability to grasp the fundamental concepts and principles underlying various AI technologies, thereby ensuring its accurate application (Burgsteiner et al., 2016). Such a comprehension boosts users’ perceptual acuity and confidence throughout the AI utilization process (Ng et al., 2021). “Applying $\mathsf { A l } ^ { \prime \prime }$ denotes the capability to appropriately deploy AI technologies across diverse contexts. For educators, this entails the discerning selection of AI tools tailored to distinct teaching environments and individual student variations (Ng et al., 2021). Moreover, understanding AI also encompasses having an AI-centric mindset, adept at deciphering concealed insights within data processed by AI (How & Hung, 2019). The “Evaluating $\mathsf { A l } ^ { \prime \prime }$ component of AIL suggests users’ proficiency beyond rudimentary knowledge; it underscores a critical assessment of AI technologies to select the most apt ones, ensuring effective AI collaboration (Long & Magerko, 2020). In regular pedagogical settings, such evaluation propels educators’ motivation and interest in employing AI, amplifying their perceived utility of the technology (Zhao et al., 2022). Lastly, “AI Ethics” emphasizes users’ commitment to moral principles, advocating the righteous use of AI technologies (Ng et al., 2021).

Figure 3. The research model and hypotheses.

In light of these insights, this paper posits the following hypotheses:

H4: Artificial Intelligence Literacy positively influences the output quality of AI technology used by teacher education students.

H5: Artificial Intelligence Literacy positively affects the perceived usefulness of AI technology among teacher education students.

H6: Artificial Intelligence Literacy positively impacts the perceived ease of use of AI technology for teacher education students.

# Research model

According to the above research hypothesis, the research model of this study is shown in Figure 3.

# Methodology

# Participants

The sample group for this study comprises pre-service teacher education students enrolled in universities offering teacher education programs across six provinces in China. Participants in this study have been exposed to the instructional applications of artificial intelligence technology during their university education. They have also taken courses related to artificial intelligence and engaged in off-campus teaching internships as part of their teacher education program. Data for this research were gathered through online survey questionnaires. The participants were informed about the research objectives, and they were made aware of their option to withdraw from the study at any point in time. We provided an assurance that all data collected in the survey would be kept confidential and exclusively utilized for research purposes. The survey was conducted from March to May 2023, with questionnaire links disseminated via WeChat and QQ to the participants s. The researchers explained the questionnaire items to them before their responses. Throughout the survey period, a total of 359 valid questionnaires were collected, and $5 7 . 6 6 \%$ of the participants identified as female. Among all participants, $6 6 . 0 2 \%$ were undergraduates, $3 3 . 9 8 \%$ were postgraduates, and the average age of all participants was 22.04 $( \mathsf { S } . \mathsf { D } = 2 . 7 0 )$ . Typically, for educational measurements employing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), an acceptable total sample size ranges from 100 to 150 (Kline, 2023). Therefore, analysing the 359 samples collected in this study using SEM is valid.

# Instrument

This research employed a survey questionnaire comprising 30 items to assess the factors influencing teacher education students’ intention to employ AI technology in information technology-enabled teaching. The survey was divided into two sections. The initial segment collected fundamental participant information, such as gender, age, and educational background. The latter part encompassed the primary questionnaire built around a theoretical model featuring five key constructs: Subjective Norm (SN), Output Quality (OQ), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Behavioral Intention (BI), and Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL). A five-point Likert scale evaluated these 30 items, where a rating of 1 denoted strong disagreement, and 5 indicated strong agreement. The 25 items related to Subjective Norms (SN), Output Quality (OQ), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), and Behavioral Intention (BI) were adapted from established and reliable survey instruments employed in prior research (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). The remaining five items concerning Attitude Towards Use (AIL) were drawn from pertinent literature (Ng et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020).

# Data analysis

The study employed Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to assess and validate the proposed theoretical model. SEM, integrating the features of factor and regression analyses, is a method for establishing and examining causal relationships between variables. It’s instrumental in describing and interpreting the complex interrelations among multiple variables. For data analysis, this study utilized AMOS 26, following the guidance of Anderson and Gerbing (1988), who recommended a two-step approach to analyse research data. The initial step involves evaluating the measurement model, while the subsequent step centres on testing the structural model. The initial phase entailed evaluating reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity to assess the adequacy of fit and the structural validity concerning observed indicators, foundational structures, and the sample data. Lastly, the study’s nine hypotheses were tested using AMOS 26 via the Maximum Likelihood method. AMOS 26 is deemed a robust tool for completing the aforementioned analytical tasks.

# Results

# Descriptive statistics of the measurement instruments

Descriptive analysis in this study was carried out using SPSS 26.0 to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the measured items and constructs. Within a rating range of 1–5, the mean of all constructs was above 3.5, ranging from 3.53 (PEU; ${ \mathsf { S D } } = 1 . 1 4 )$ to 3.81 $\mathsf { S N } ;$ $\mathsf { S D } = 1 . 0 3 \mathrm { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ ). The mean of measured items ranged from 3.38 (PEU4; $\mathsf { S D } = 1 . 1 5 )$ ) to 4.01 (SN4; $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 1$ ). Descriptive analysis also required measuring the skewness and kurtosis of the sample data to determine its normality (Teo & Noyes, 2011). Previous research has shown that when skewness and kurtosis values exceed 2.3, such situations are categorized as severe non-normality. As depicted in Table 1, the skewness of all measured items falls within the range of $- 0 . 2 5$ to $- 1 . 0 3$ , while kurtosis ranges from $- 0 . 9 0$ to 1.27. All the measured items have appropriate skewness and kurtosis, all less than 2.3, indicating slight non-normality, and the data is close to a normal distribution. In the presence of severe nonnormality, the impact on the standard error of parameter estimation is nearly negligible (Lei $\&$ Lomax, 2005). Consequently, the sample data in this study remains entirely acceptable for the conventional interpretation of SEM parameter estimates.

# Scale refinement process

To assess the internal consistency of the measurement items, we calculated Cronbach’s α coefficient to evaluate the interconnectedness of items within each construct. As outlined in Table 1, the Cronbach’s α coefficient for each construct varied between 0.879 and 0.920, exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.7 (Hair et al., 1998; Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994), thus signifying strong reliability.

Before embarking on exploratory factor analysis, both Bartlett’s test of sphericity and the KaiserMeyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy were executed. The results of Bartlett’s test of sphericity demonstrated a highly significant level $( p < 0 . 0 0 0 )$ , and the KMO value, at 0.919, exceeded the acceptable threshold of 0.500 (Hair, 1998), affirming the appropriateness of factor analysis. In this research, principal components were extracted employing the principal component analysis method, and a Kaiser normalization maximum variance rotation approach was adopted. The rotation converged after 6 iterations, and components with eigenvalues exceeding 1 were extracted, as displayed in Table 2, revealing 6 principal components accounting for a total variance of $7 2 . 5 0 6 \%$ . Prior research findings indicate that items with factor loadings $> 0 . 6$ are considered valid (Kline, 1994). An examination of the rotated component matrix reaffirms that the composition of factors aligns with the measurement items introduced in this study.

# Test for measurement model

The outcomes of the Exploratory Factor Analysis reveal that the scale exhibits strong validity. To enhance the construct validity, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted, encompassing an evaluation of both convergent and discriminant validity. Convergent validity was evaluated using two key indices: Composite Reliability (CR) and Average Variance Extracted (AVE). Past research suggests that CR should surpass 0.7, and the recommended threshold for AVE is above 0.5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). As illustrated in Table 3, the Composite Reliability (CR) for each construct surpasses 0.7, and the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for each construct is greater than 0.5. These findings suggest robust convergent validity, indicating strong interrelatedness among the latent variables in this study. Discriminant validity can be evaluated through cross-loadings, and Table 4 presents the square roots of Average Variance Extracted (AVE) along with inter-construct correlations. According to Urbach and Ahlemann (2010), the square root of a construct’s AVE should surpass its shared correlations with other constructs in the model. As shown in Table 4, the square roots of Average Variance Extracted (AVEs) consistently surpass the corresponding inter-construct correlations, firmly establishing discriminant validity.

Moreover, this study verified the goodness of fit of the measurement model to the sample data. The $\tt X 2 / d f$ value is 1.312, falling below the recommended threshold of $< 3 . 0$ , as defined by Carmines and McIver (1983). Recommended values for NFI, CFI, and GFI should exceed 0.9, as specified by Hair et al., (1998) and Doll et al. (1994). In this study, NFI, CFI, and GFI values are 0.931, 0.983, and 0.917, respectively, all surpassing the specified threshold of 0.9. AGFI equals 0.901, which surpasses the recommended threshold of 0.8 established by Bentler and Bonett (1980). RMSEA is 0.030, below the recommended threshold of $< 0 . 0 8$ set by Hair et al., (2010). In summary, the measurement model in this study exhibits a good fit with the sample data.

# Test for structural model

The goodness-of-fit indices for the structural model suggest a satisfactory fit to the data. $( \mathsf { X } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { d } \mathsf { f } =$ 1.309, RMSEA $= 0 . 0 2 9$ , $\mathsf { N F l } = 0 . 9 2 9$ , ${ \sf C F I } = 0 . 9 8 2$ , $\mathsf { G F l } = 0 . 9 1 6$ , $\mathsf { A G F l } = 0 . 9 0 1$ ). Additionally, all the hypotheses in this study were supported with significance levels $p < 0 . 0 5$ (as shown in Table 5). Figure 4 provides a summary of the analysis of the structural model in this research.

The ${ \mathsf { R } } ^ { 2 }$ , denoting the explained variability or total variance accounted for, serves as a measure of the model’s explanatory capability. In SEM models, as described by Chin (1998), R square values can be categorized into strong $( \mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } > 0 . 6 7 )$ , moderate $( 0 . 3 3 \leq \mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } \leq 0 . 6 7 )$ , and weak $( \mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } < 0 . 1 9 )$ explanatory powers. In the context of this study, the $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ values for the four endogenous variables: Output Quality (OQ), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), and Intention to Use Artificial Intelligence Technology (BI), were 0.261, 0.228, 0.314, and 0.372, respectively. These values fall within the range of moderate explanatory power, suggesting that these endogenous variables possess a moderate level of explanatory capability within the model.

within the model, while indirect effects represent the impact of one construct on the target construct through intermediary constructs in the model. The total effect on constructs encompasses the cumulative impact of both direct and indirect pathways. Our research encompassed 5000 bootstrapping iterations (Taylor, MacKinnon, & Tein, 2008) at a $9 5 \%$ confidence level. Following the guidelines of Preacher and Hayes (2008), we computed lower and upper confidence intervals to evaluate the significance of these indirect effects.

The outcomes of the bootstrap test affirm the existence of indirect effects in the subsequent relationships: Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) demonstrates an indirect impact on Perceived Usefulness (PU) with a standardized coefficient of 0.224. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) exhibits an indirect influence on Behavioral Intention (BI) to utilize AI technology, with a standardized coefficient of 0.272. Subjective Norm (SN) illustrates an indirect effect on BI to employ AI technology, with a standardized coefficient of 0.067. Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) exerts an indirect impact on BI to use AI technology, with a standardized coefficient of 0.139. Output Quality (OQ) manifests an indirect influence on BI to use AI technology, with a standardized coefficient of 0.079. Among these indirect effects, Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) produces the most substantial impact on the readiness of teacher education students to embrace AI technology for information technology instruction. The ranking of indirect effects, from greatest to smallest, is as follows: AIL, PEU, OQ, and SN.

# Discussion

This study extends the TAM to explore the factors influencing the willingness of teacher education students to use artificial intelligence technology in information technology-enabled teaching. The research results ultimately demonstrate the effectiveness of the extended TAM in explaining the willingness of teacher education students to use artificial intelligence technology in information technology-enabled teaching. Finally, to further substantiate and elucidate the results obtained from the research data, we conducted semi-structured interviews with teacher education students who participated in the study. The participants comprised three females and two males. Through these semi-structured interviews, we inquired about the experiences of teacher education students in utilizing AI technology for digitized teaching. Specifically, we explored issues encountered when using AI technology in digitized teaching, the perceived effects of AI technology in digitized teaching, reasons for incorporating AI technology into teaching, and attitudes towards the future application of AI technology in teaching. Sample statements included: “How do you perceive the effectiveness of utilizing AI technology for digitized teaching?” “What opportunities have led you to encounter AI technology in your teaching?” “What major challenges have you faced in using AI technology for digitized teaching?” and “What factors would motivate you to continue using AI technology for digitized teaching in the future?” Through qualitative analysis, triangulation was employed on the quantitative statistical results to enhance the credibility of the research findings.

Among the numerous influencing factors, it is found that H8: Perceived Usefulness (PU) has the most significant direct impact on Behavioral Intention (BI) $( \beta = 0 . 4 8 1 , p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). H9: Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) also has a significant and positive impact on Behavioral Intention (BI), but the path coefficient is smaller than the impact of Perceived Usefulness $( \beta = 0 . 1 6 7$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). H7: Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) has a positive and significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (PU) $( \beta = 0 . 2 9 5$ , $p <$ 0.001). These hypotheses align with the tenets of the TAM theory as put forth by Davis et al. (1989). The results of this study indicate that the impact of Perceived Usefulness (PU) on Behavioral Intention (BI) is more significant than the effect of Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) on Behavioral Intention (BI). This suggests that, in information technology-enabled teaching for teacher education students, the usefulness of artificial intelligence technology is the primary factor influencing its usage. A teacher education student expressed, “The primary motivation for learning new digitized teaching technologies and continuing their use in the future is that they genuinely contribute to teaching, enhancing the effectiveness of my classroom instruction”. If using artificial intelligence technology can enhance their teaching effectiveness or improve student learning outcomes, this group is more inclined to use artificial intelligence technology. On the contrary, when the technology is user-friendly, but its contribution to teaching is not substantial, this group is less inclined to adopt artificial intelligence technology. Additionally, Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) indirectly influences Behavioral Intention (BI) through the mediating effect of Perceived Usefulness (PU). This indicates that Perceived Ease of Use can increase teacher education students’ awareness of artificial intelligence technology, making them perceive it as useful, ultimately indirectly enhancing their intention to use artificial intelligence technology in information technology-enabled teaching. This demonstrates the complexity of the user decision-making process, where teacher education students, when considering the application of artificial intelligence in information technology-enabled teaching, prioritize the technology’s usefulness while also considering its ease of use. Users believe that easy-to-use technology is more likely to be useful in information technology-enabled teaching, and these two aspects mutually influence each other, ultimately promoting the intention to use artificial intelligence technology.

In the extended structure of this study, H4: Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) has the highest and significant impact on Output Quality (OQ) in all structures $( \beta = 0 . 5 2 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). This suggests that possessing artificial intelligence literacy allows individuals to correctly extract hidden information from data processed by artificial intelligence technology, leading to better outcomes, which aligns with previous viewpoints (How & Hung, 2019). H3: Output Quality (OQ) has a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (PU) $( \beta = 0 . 1 6 9$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), indicating that teachers, when observing good performance of artificial intelligence technology in information technology-enabled teaching, are more likely to perceive it as useful, although the impact is relatively low. Additionally, H5: Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) has a positive and significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (PU) $( \beta = 0 . 1 8 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ), as well as H6: Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) on Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) $( \beta = 0 . 4 8 8$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ). However, the impact of Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) on Perceived Usefulness (PU) is weaker, which is consistent with the conclusion proposed by previous scholars (Zhao et al., 2022). These hypotheses indicate that when teachers possess artificial intelligence literacy, using artificial intelligence technology becomes easier, allowing them to better understand the workings of artificial intelligence technology, more effectively utilize artificial intelligence tools, and thus enhance their work efficiency. However, the lower impact on Perceived Usefulness (PU) is because artificial intelligence literacy, while helping users understand the use of artificial intelligence technology, may not directly relate to the practical utility of specific tasks in a teaching environment. H1: Subjective Norms (SN) has a significant positive impact on Behavioral Intention (BI) $( \beta = 0 . 1 1 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), and H2: Subjective Norms (SN) has a significant positive impact on Perceived Usefulness (PU) $( \beta = 0 . 1 4 7$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), consistent with the research findings of Venkatesh.

However, the degree of influence is small. This is because in the environment of this study, teacher education students’ perceptions of artificial intelligence technology are primarily based on their own experiences and judgements, rather than solely on the opinions of those around them. Thus, Subjective Norms (SN) is not the primary factor influencing teacher education students’ intention to use artificial intelligence technology. In the extended structure, Subjective Norms (SN), Output Quality (OQ), and Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) all have significant indirect effects on Behavioral Intention (BI). Among them, the indirect effect of Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) on Behavioral Intention (BI) is the most significant (standardized indirect effect $= 0 . 2 7 2 $ ). This suggests that while Subjective Norms (SN) and Output Quality (OQ) have indirect effects on BI, the influence of Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) on Behavioral Intention (BI) is more substantial, highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence literacy in modern information technology-enabled education. Some teacher education students openly admitted, ” During my college year, I engaged in a modern educational technology teaching competition, and through active participation in the competition, I acquired a deeper understanding of artificial intelligence knowledge gaining early exposure to utilizing AI technology as a teaching aid. This experience garnered from such competitions has been instrumental in facilitating my application of AI technology within practical teaching environments. ” Enhancing teacher education students’ artificial intelligence literacy can indirectly enhance their perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, thereby promoting the intention to use artificial intelligence technology in information technology-enabled teaching.

# Conclusions, limitations, and future research

This study builds upon the TAM and expands its external variables to explore the factors influencing the inclination of teacher education students to adopt artificial intelligence technology in information technology-enabled teaching. The research affirms that TAM is adequate in elucidating the willingness of teacher education students to embrace artificial intelligence technology within an information technology-enabled teaching environment. Using this model, the research empirically demonstrates the significant role of Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) in teacher acceptance of artificial intelligence technology, laying the foundation for further research in technology acceptance model theory. Among the direct influencing factors within this model, it is evident that Perceived Usefulness (PU) has the most substantial impact on the intention to use artificial intelligence technology (BI). In the daily process of information technology-enabled teaching, when assessing whether a particular artificial intelligence technology should be applied to teaching, the primary focus should be on the practical utility of the technology. In other words, this artificial intelligence technology can enhance the quality of teaching or help teachers more effectively complete tasks. Hence, in teacher training sessions and workshops focusing on the implementation of artificial intelligence technology in education, it is of paramount importance to highlight the tangible benefits and advantages associated with utilizing this technology in teaching. This emphasis is essential for effectively motivating educators to incorporate it into their teaching practices. This stands as a pivotal element in advancing the utilization of artificial intelligence technology in information technology-enabled teaching. Artificial Intelligence Literacy (AIL) exhibits the most pronounced indirect effect on the intention to use artificial intelligence technology in such teaching environments. The assertion underscores the evolving significance of artificial intelligence technology as a fundamental skill for individuals across various domains, extending beyond the realm of computer scientists. In the 21st century, technological literacy will encompass artificial intelligence literacy, which will be a new skill that everyone should learn to adapt to this new era of intelligence (Ng et al., 2021). The results of this study also affirm that enhancing teachers’ artificial intelligence literacy can indirectly strengthen their willingness to use AI technology in digitized teaching. Artificial intelligence literacy, as a novel form of digital literacy, should receive attention and focus in the future. Emphasizing the cultivation of teachers’ artificial intelligence literacy is essential. Only when teachers have the inclination to utilize AI technology in digitized teaching can they adapt to the impending era of artificial intelligence. This adaptation is crucial for nurturing a new generation of talent that aligns with the characteristics of this era.

In the future, addressing the challenges brought by the era of artificial intelligence to education necessitates a focus on cultivating teachers’ AI literacy in teacher training programs, as indicated by the results of this study. Regarding training in information technology for teaching, efforts should be directed towards helping teachers understand the operational principles of artificial intelligence technologies. This understanding will enable teachers to effectively integrate these technologies into classroom instruction. In training on educational philosophy, emphasis should be placed on teaching teachers artificial intelligence principles and ethics. This understanding will enable teachers to better comprehend how artificial intelligence influences student learning and how to promote innovation and interdisciplinary learning in the classroom. Particularly, ethical issues related to artificial intelligence, such as privacy concerns, should be addressed. Teachers using AI technology must have a sense of responsibility for safeguarding student privacy, fostering an ethical awareness of the correct use of AI technology. For educational institutions, collaboration and resource integration with AI technology companies are crucial. In the era of artificial intelligence, technological advancements occur rapidly, and relevant educational institutions must ensure the timely updating of AI-related educational equipment, keeping pace with technological developments to ensure that education benefits from the advantages of new technologies. Simultaneously, educational institutions should focus on establishing professional smart education teams on campus. Team members should possess expertise in the field of artificial intelligence, enabling them to provide timely, professional, and effective answers to the issues teachers encounter when using AI technology in actual teaching.

At the same time, the adoption and promotion of artificial intelligence technology in educational teaching will encounter certain obstacles. Firstly, the disparities in teacher qualifications and acceptance levels between schools are significant hurdles. Differences exist between teachers in urban and rural schools in China, as well as among teachers in different urban schools. This leads to a lack of familiarity among teachers with the application of artificial intelligence technology, hindering them from fully realizing its potential. Additionally, that may lead to teachers lacking confidence in using AI technology and being fearful or unwilling to adopt related technologies. Furthermore, educational policies and standards act as impediments to the widespread adoption of AI technology in schools. If the government increases its efforts at the policy level to support and encourage the application of artificial intelligence technology in education, it will provide schools with the courage to accept new technologies, thereby advancing the promotion and application of AI technology-related educational equipment in schools.

This study exhibits several limitations that merit acknowledgement. Primarily, the theoretical underpinning of this paper is based on the TAM model. While the TAM model is widely used to understand technology acceptance, it can be further enhanced by incorporating other theoretical frameworks to increase its comprehensiveness and predictive power. Factors such as sociocultural elements, educational environment, and technological infrastructure might influence technology acceptance and could provide a more comprehensive perspective when combined with other theories. Furthermore, the results of this study may not be entirely representative because of the vast number of universities in China. Differences in the usage of artificial intelligence technology among teacher education students may exist due to variations in the educational environment, resources, academic culture, and technical support at each institution. These factors can influence the acceptance of artificial intelligence technology among teacher education students. Finally, due to the continuous evolution of technology and the educational landscape, the conclusions drawn may be subject to the influence of time. Currently, artificial intelligence technology is progressing and developing rapidly. The acceptance and willingness to use AI technology among teacher education students may undergo corresponding changes. With the introduction of new AI teaching tools into schools and the ongoing transformation of societal perceptions regarding artificial intelligence technology, the generalizability and sustainability of the research results may face challenges.

In forthcoming scholarly investigations, it becomes imperative to investigate the factors that influence educators’ acceptance of artificial intelligence technology across diverse educational contexts and to scrutinize the variables that influence its utilization by educators within various educational settings. Simultaneously, it is possible to introduce new external variables onto the foundation of the current theoretical model to explore the impact of changes in intention to use after the incorporation of these additional variables. Furthermore, one can consider conducting comparative tests to examine the variations in the intention to use among teachers undergoing instructional training for the integration of artificial intelligence technology before and after the training. This analysis of comparisons can shed light on how each factor influences the inclination to use, consequently evaluating the influence of educational training on teachers’ adoption of AI technology in educational settings. Consequently, ongoing research and continual updates in this field are inevitable to ensure the sustained relevance of the theory and the accuracy of practical applications.
