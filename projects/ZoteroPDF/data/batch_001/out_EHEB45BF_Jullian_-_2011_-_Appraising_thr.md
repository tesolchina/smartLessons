# Appraising through someone else’s words: The evaluative power of quotations in news reports

Paula M. Jullian Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile

# Abstract

This article explores the inclusion of external voices in news reports, especially looking at the way these are exploited for appraising purposes. It is argued that attributions are not evaluation outlets for sources only, but indirect means of appraisal for the journalists as well, who support – and reinforce – the points they want to make through these voices. In this way, quotations help them imprint their personal views on the events and ultimately serve an ideological function in the text. The study compares the use of attributed material in various pieces of online news reporting on the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize award to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. Taking some elements of Appraisal Theory, the article examines the role of external sources in two corpora representing opposite ideological positions concerning this event – China and the Western world – in order to explore how such material is used by the writer to engage in an ideological–evaluative activity.

# Introduction

This article explores the conveyance of appraisal – and indirectly of ideology – in a particular piece of news which was ideologically loaded from its very onset; namely the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 award to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, who was held in a Chinese prison at the time of the nomination. The award, naturally, raised great controversy and triggered radically different reactions in China, where Mr Liu is regarded as a criminal by the Chinese government, and in the Western world, where he is seen as a leading figure in the struggle for the human rights of the Chinese people. Given the polarity the pronouncement caused, it was reported quite differently in the two parts of the world. This investigation looks at the way such differences were conveyed in the reporting of the event on both sides, focusing on the role of the sources included in their news reports.

It is well known that news reports in the Western world are deeply influenced by the editorial line of the medium in which they appear. Conversely, the media in China are heavily controlled by the State. So it may be said that most journalists are somehow restrained in presenting their views on the issues absolutely freely. However, research in critical discourse analysis (CDA) and critical discourse studies (CDS) has proven that language reproduces ideology and therefore that no text is free from ideology. Van Dijk’s model (2006: 125) shows thoroughly how every detail in the encoding of discourse entails choices based on ideology. That is why the reporting of news is equally loaded with journalists’ views and beliefs, even when they try to remain neutral. The view of journalistic objectivity in reporting is a long-standing myth openly acknowledged by journalists themselves (Bell, 1991; White, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006; Rodrigo-Alsina, 2005) and as well as unveiled by linguistic studies (Van Dijk, 1985, 1988; Fowler, 1991; Fairclough, 1995, 1998).

The role of sources in the news has certainly received some attention in the linguistic– journalistic literature (Sigal, 1986; Lee and Salomon, 1990; Soley, 1992; Sundar, 1998; Manning, 2001), but this has basically been centred on their authority and credibility. Little attention has been paid to the evaluative role sources play in the content of the ‘story’ (Bell, 1991: Ch. 13). External voices ‘are allowed’ to speak their minds much more loudly than journalists, so a way in which authors may convey their views is through the choice of the informants they bring into the text and the information they choose to include or exclude. Such choices carry strong ideological implications, since the mere inclusion of a particular source is the first signal of subjectivity; it reflects who the reporter finds worth interviewing and what s/he finds relevant and reportable in the communicative event. Comments and judgements made through such sources cannot be attributed to the author him/herself, but they certainly tint the story in such a way that readers get the desired view, without strongly committing the journalist to the content and perspectives conveyed by others.

In a way, it may be said that no other discourse type is more ideological than the news report since this genre is not overtly political, but the selection of the event, the framing, the sources, the way the events are presented, the heading, etc. are all ideological decisions. Naturally, if the readership shares the belief system of the editorial line, they may not even notice the slanting of the meaning.

This article examines the inclusion of external voices in the overall articulation of the Nobel Peace Prize news report, in order to elucidate to what extent they served as a rhetorical resource for journalists to convey their stance and the desired portrayal of Liu Xiaobo and of the event they wanted to communicate. This study is framed within Scollon’s (1997, 1998) model of Mediated Discourse and taking certain aspects of

Appraisal Theory (Martin, 2000, 2003; White, 2003; Martin and White, 2005) concerning the conveyance of implicit evaluation.1

# The ideological role of quotations in the news

# The ideological dimension of attributions in the news

A good background framework for the discussion of quotations in the text is Sinclair’s (1986) ‘averral–attribution’ distinction, which sets the essential division between the authorial and external voices. While an averral denotes a statement originating in the writer, an attribution signals someone else as the agent of the statement. Sinclair argues that, through attribution, the writer voices someone else’s views, theories or beliefs, placing the responsibility for these propositions on their averrer. This choice has enormous rhetorical implications, since when the writer chooses to present a proposition as attributed s/he detaches him/herself from the content and signals explicitly that it derives from a source. The skilled exploitation of the interplay between averral and attribution allows the writer to construct a stance by transferring the role of the averrer. Thus, authors can make convenient use of attribution by quoting heavily evaluative materials while delegating their accountability to someone else.2 Despite some cases of indeterminacy, the averral/attribution distinction still proves useful for the purposes of the study of the interplay between voices.

The inclusion of external voices is of crucial interest in the analysis of journalistic discourse, and especially for the study of news reports, since these rely heavily on information provided by sources; this is why the role of reporting has been at the centre of discourse analysis of news reports (e.g. Van Dijk, 1988; Fairclough, 1992; Waugh, 1995; Scollon, 1998; Smirnova, 2009). Bell (1991) argues that much of the content of news stories consists of recounts of what others have said, which merge with the writer’s discourse, sometimes into such mixed statements that, at times, it is difficult to tell apart what comes from the sources and what is the writer’s own. Bell assigns quotations a central role, noting that ‘most of the information journalists use is second-hand’ (p. 52). For him, news consists almost entirely of what someone has said, either as witness to the facts or as news actor. He defines news as ‘what an authoritative source tells a journalist’ (p. 191); the more elite the source, the more newsworthy the story. Therefore, for him, news is basically embedded talk and thereby the notion of embedding is key to understanding the language of news discourse. That is why the style of news reports is seen as a form of embeddedment, to the point that Bednarek claims that ‘embeddedness’ is one of the most characteristic features of newspaper language (Bednarek, 2006: 15). In addition to this, Bell also observes that within the context of journalistic discourse, a large proportion of what journalists report is not action but what he calls ‘talk about talk’ (p. 60), such as announcements, opinions, reactions, appeals, promises, criticisms, etc.,3 which is the case for the piece of news investigated here.

Quotations serve many purposes to the journalist: they may be used to give credibility to the reporting and to the writer’s words; to reassert what has been or will be said later; to give flavour to the story; to detach the writer from the responsibility of the content of the quotes; to confront different views of the events; and so on (see, for example,

Van Dijk, 1985, 1988; Fowler, 1991; Caldas-Coulthard, 1994; Fairclough, 1995, 1998; Scollon, 1998; Sundar, 1998; Manning, 2001). However, in addition to such contributions, they may serve purposes of evaluation in very subtle ways. This material is very often used to praise, condemn, discredit, etc. the events or the people involved in such events. However, quotations may also serve to appraise the sources themselves, in such a way that the journalist’s skilful use of quotations may equally make the speaker sound sharp, considerate or attractive or, if used sarcastically, the speaker may appear unintelligent, cruel, naive, etc.

Scollon (1998) takes the issue further and suggests that the use of quotations is a form of writer’s control over the material s/he presents, since the reporter retains the ‘authorship’ (the right to find the wording for the ideas) but delegates the ‘principalship’ (the responsibility for what is said) and, by this delegation, the reporter stands aside from the argument. He explains that ‘the newsmakers are evaluated and characterized in the process of giving them a voice’ (p. 217), explaining that such voice is not given neutrally since the journalist keeps the power to characterize the evaluative stance of those ideas. This point will be illustrated in the corpus analysis in this article.

# Evaluation through the attributed material

The Appraisal Model4 offers a thorough model of analysis to identify and describe the writer’s attitude towards the content of the discourse under analysis. Such a model includes three main systems (ATTITUDE, ENGAGEMENT and GRADUATION), which in turn are subdivided into subcategories focused on specific attitudinal and linguistic aspects. The model addresses the inclusion of attributed material within the system of ENGAGEMENT. Its advocates see the practice of quoting external sources as a sign of intertextual positioning to expand the writer’s voice to acknowledge heteroglossic diversity (e.g. White, 1998, 2003). However, the ENGAGEMENT system of the model is more concerned with the framing of the statements as a way to reveal the writer’s interpersonal standing, than with the appraising content of the quotes. Interestingly, the model offers a more helpful tool for our purposes within the system of ATTITUDE. Within this system is the subsystem JUDGEMENT, which focuses entirely on the writer’s expression of evaluation5 in discourse. This framework is very helpful since it addresses not only outright evaluations, but also offers the necessary tools to identify and describe subtler forms of appraisal. This resource acknowledges manners of explicit (i.e. ‘inscribed’) evaluation which lie on the surface of the text, and also offers categories for more indirect or outright implicit (i.e. ‘invoked’) forms of appraisals. These, in turn, can be subdivided into more elusive tokens leading to evaluations, namely tokens of invoked and evoked evaluation. Advocates of the Appraisal Theory explain that such tokens work by triggering certain attitudes in the readers – based on their value system – and so somehow positioning them in the writer’s own intersubjec tive position. This can be seen in this investigation in those quotations which, although not explicitly evaluative, behave so ‘in context’, given the writer’s assumptions of shared values on which the stories are written. White explains that these tokens basically refer to neutral formulations on the surface, but which have the power in society to trigger an evaluative reaction in the reader.

# Data and method

# Corpus description

The corpus was made up of news reports, drawn from major international news networks, on the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize made by Thorbjoern Jagland, the Nobel Committee chairman, on Friday 8 October 2010 and the world’s immediate reaction to the award followed up to 10 October – that is to say, reports on the first moments of the piece of news only, when this was still quite fresh and there was still little awareness of the impact the award would have. The deluge of information in the press that followed the announcement was not included. As from Sunday on, there were dozens of opinion columns on Liu Xiaobo’s profile, calls for his release, speculations on his wife’s home arrest, celebrations both in the West and in China, etc., but these texts were different from news reports, belonging to more opinionated genres, which allow for a more open expression of ideas and emotions.

I sought to have an even corpus of news networks representing the Western view (the BBC, CNN, The Daily Telegraph), the Chinese perspective (English.Eastday.com; People’s Daily online; China Daily) and a more neutral one in this respect, representing neither one side nor the other (Al-Jazeera).6 The Western choice sought to represent two well-known information networks, a UK- and a US-based, and a recognized conservative article – The Daily Telegraph – whose views tend to be more conventional than the other two influential chains. Two out of the three Chinese papers (People’s Daily online and China Daily) correspond to major international online Chinese newspapers available in English and Eastday.com, which corresponds to the English version of Shanghai Daily. 7

As a result, the full corpus was comprised of 13 news reports which referred exclusively to the announcement of the Prize award and the world’s reaction to it, which made up a total of 7649 words. The corpus was made up of the body of the news report only; this means that headlines, leads and captions were excluded. Since this was a comparative study, the whole corpus was split into two corpora: the Chinese one and the Western one, which for these effects included the Al-Jazeera news chain. The corpora – by number of words – came out as shown in the Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1. Chinese corpus with number of words per news reports   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Chinese news reports corpus</td><td>Friday 8 Oct.</td><td>Saturday 9 Oct.</td><td>Sunday 10 Oct.</td><td>Total no. of words</td></tr><tr><td>English.Eastday. com (xl)</td><td>0</td><td>212</td><td>0</td><td>212</td></tr><tr><td>People&#x27;s Daily online (x2)</td><td>212</td><td>503</td><td>0</td><td>715</td></tr><tr><td>China Daily (x2)</td><td>212</td><td>204</td><td>0</td><td>416</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1343</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 2. Western corpus with number of words per news reports   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Western news reports corpus</td><td>Friday 8 Oct.</td><td>Saturday 9 Oct.</td><td>Sunday 10 Oct.</td><td>Total no. of words</td></tr><tr><td>BBC (x3)</td><td>856</td><td>590</td><td>568</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>CNN (x2)</td><td>1298</td><td>478</td><td>0</td><td>1776</td></tr><tr><td>Al-Jazeera (x2)</td><td>861</td><td>1093</td><td>0</td><td>1954</td></tr><tr><td>The Daily</td><td>562</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>562</td></tr><tr><td>Telegraph (x1) Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>6306</td></tr><tr><td>Grand total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>7649</td></tr></table></body></html>

A shortcoming of the whole corpus, and therefore of the resulting comparisons, was that the Chinese corpus was significantly smaller. The reasons for this drawback were, first, the reduced number of Chinese papers published in English and, beyond this, the lack of information on the issue. In most networks, there was no mention of the event and, wherever it was found, the report was exactly the same story – identical even in number of words (212) – to those already included thrice in the corpus. This story was a paraphrase of a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, which provided what may be considered the official position of the Chinese government concerning the award.8 This piece of news was considerably shorter in length than those found in Western papers, which made the Chinese corpus quite uneven with its counterpart. This was, in my view, the first ideological finding of the investigation.

# Method

The different pieces of news were coded and numbered to indicate their source and order of apparition. The nomenclature results are shown in Table 3.

Table 3. Coding of Chinese and Western corpora   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>Source</td><td>Code</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>English.Eastday.com</td><td>EEcom (I)</td></tr><tr><td>2,3</td><td>People&#x27;s Daily online</td><td>PDO (I &amp; 2)</td></tr><tr><td>4,5</td><td>China Daily</td><td>CD (I &amp;2)</td></tr><tr><td>6,7,8</td><td>BBC</td><td>BBC (1,2 &amp; 3)</td></tr><tr><td>9,10</td><td>CNN</td><td>CNN (I &amp; 2)</td></tr><tr><td>11,12</td><td>Al-Jazeera</td><td>AL (1 &amp; 2)</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>The Daily Telegraph</td><td>Tt (I)</td></tr></table></body></html>

The discourse type of news online is quite different from that of printed newspapers. It is characterized by very short paragraphs, chiefly made up of single sentences, linked by few or no connectors. Hence, the unity of the discourse is given by the topic rather than by the surface-linking devices. My unit of analysis was, then, what I call the Online News Paragraph (ONP), which often matches the conventional notion of a sentence, i.e. from stop to stop, but which can also include more than one utterance.

All pieces of news were were entered into the same column of an excel worksheet with one ONP per cell. Then the averred and attributed ONPs were sorted in parallel columns and then the content the ONPs both averred and containing attributed material was analysed semantically considering: whether their content was evaluative; whether the appraisal was negative (Neg.) or positive (Pos.); whether such appraisal was explicit (Expl.) or rather indirect (Impl.); and who/what was being appraised. I adopted the categories ‘Ev.’ for stretches explicitly evaluative and ‘In context’ (contracted as ‘In ctxt’ below) for those which acquired this value in context. This information was entered in the columns to the right of the ONPs under the categories for each question, and was later sorted and counted down in order to see more clearly the proportion of evaluative content in each type of ONP. The analysis worksheet can be seen in Figure 1.

Given that the focus was on the content and judgemental value of the attributed material – and eventually on its overall evaluative effect in the story – no attention was paid to the framing of the quotations.9 Therefore, no distinction was made as to whether the attributed material was presented in direct or indirect speech – but following Sinclair’s (1986) distinction, the material was simply divided into ‘averred’ or ‘attributed’.

Mixed cases, containing both attributed and averred materials, were classified under the attributed category, since the averred section normally corresponded to the framing of the attributions, as in example 1:

(1) In the weeks leading up to this announcement, Beijing was very strong in its statements. It said that Liu Xiaobo was not a suitable candidate. (CNN2.6)

Unclear instances, in which it was not obvious whether the framing was the journalist’s or a paraphrase of the source’s quotation, were placed under the attributed material, provided there was a reporting verb or another reporting marker (underlined in the example). For instance, in the example below, it is not clear whether the opening is just the framing or part of Mr Ma’s quotation.

(2) China and Norway have enjoyed sound development of bilateral ties in recent years. Ma said this was conducive to the fundamental interests of the two nations and their peoples. (PDO1.10)

Averred ONPs containing a single word or short stretch of attributed material – often in inverted commas to indicate that it was uttered by a source – were not counted as attributions, despite the presence of attribution markers (underlined in the example). For example:

(3) … a statement made by the Foreign Ministry, describing Mr Liu as a ‘criminal’ – and saying the decision to award him the prize was an ‘obscenity’. (BBC3.6)

Instances of narrative speech acts (NSA) (e.g. see Leech and Short, 1981; Semino and Short, 2004) were not classified as attributed, despite bearing some of the content the speaker may have communicated, as in (4):

(4) The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader who won the Nobel Peace prize in 1989 … congratulated Liu and called for his release. (AJ2.14)

As a result of these inclusions/exclusions, the corpus came out as uniform as it was possible to become, and only then was the analysis of the evaluative content carried out.

# Analysis and results

# Averred versus attributed material in the corpus

The first point of comparison was the averred versus attributed proportion. Unsurprisingly, the comparison between both corpora came out quite unbalanced since, as noted earlier, the Chinese reports proved to be considerably shorter. These stories were characterized by a timid presence of the writer’s voice and were dominated by Mr Ma Zhaoxu’s statement – the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman – whose remarks were repeated identically throughout the Chinese corpus and whose opinion, in four out of five stories, corresponded to the only external voice in the piece of news. So while the attributed material in the Chinese corpus amounted to 42 out of 54 ONPs $( = 7 7$ , 7 per cent), attributions in the Western one added up to 131 out of 224 ONPs $( = 5 8$ , 4 per cent). The resulting ratio of attributed versus averred ONP per story can be seen in Table 4. This higher proportion of attributed ONPs in the Chinese corpus – with its corresponding low incidence of the journalist’s voice – derives largely from the fact that its stories were basically a paraphrase of Mr Ma’s words, with minimal or no differences between one news report and another. This equivalence can be seen in Tables 5 and 6, in which the detail of attributed versus averred ONPs per news article can be seen.

# Number of sources per report

Along the same lines, the comparison of the average number of ONPs of quoted material was also quite uneven in both corpora. Three out of the five Chinese news reports corresponded to exactly the same article and the other two were almost identical, all citing exactly the same source. In this context, the 8.4 average attributed ONPs in the Chinese corpus is not comparable with the 16.4 ONPs in the Western corpus. While the former figure results from the number of quotations of almost a single source, the latter derives from a large number of varied sources who range from political leaders to representatives of human rights organizations, and even to twitterers. The only exception of other voices in the Chinese corpus is PDO2 which, in addition to Mr Ma’s remarks, included two other authoritative voices (academics from Chinese universities) who, as with Mr Ma, blast the prize and Liu’s accomplishments. The reports of the Western corpus, on the contrary, presented a much wider range of sources. All of them coincided in their inclusion of the main actors of the story, such as Mr Ma, Liu’s wife, Mr Jagland, the president of the Nobel Prize Committee, etc. This makes the number of voices behind the Chinese 8.4 and the Western 16.4 of ONPs quite incomparable. This can be seen in Table 7, which shows that while quoted sources in the Chinese corpus amount to an average of 1.4, the counter average of quoted sources in the Western papers amount to 9.0 speakers.

# The presence of evaluative content in the attributed material

The analysis of the semantic content of the attributed ONPs was based on the two categories mentioned above, namely ‘Ev’/‘In context’, basically explicit versus invoked forms of appraisal. According to the analysis, almost all attributed material proved evaluative, although there were differences in their evaluative intensity. While some quotations clearly stood out as outright forms of appraisal, others evaluated more moderately. Given the differences in the evaluative value of the ONPs, they were not fully comparable and hence difficult to quantify. The figures of the evaluative material per category can be seen in Table 8, which shows the proportion of attributed evaluation against the overall attributed material.

Table 8. Comparison of the evaluative content in the attributed ONPs in both corpora   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>All attributed ONPs</td><td>Explicitly evaluative (Ev)</td><td>Evaluation &#x27;In context&#x27;</td><td>Other (non-evaluative)</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese news</td><td>42</td><td>29</td><td>13</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Western news</td><td>131</td><td>65</td><td>48</td><td>18</td></tr></table></body></html>

The division between explicitly evaluative (‘Ev’) as opposed to statements which acquired evaluative meaning in context (‘In context’) was determined by White’s ‘Inscribed’ and ‘Invoked’ categories of appraisal introduced earlier. Some outright examples of negative and positive examples of explicit evaluation (‘Ev’) found in my corpora are:

(5) Ma said Liu was a criminal sentenced by the Chinese judicial authorities for violating Chinese law. (CD1.6)   
(6) Xiaobo is a gentle and brave person, he will probably give away the award to all political prisoners in China and all over the world, Brossel said. (AJ2.21)

These were easy to find in both corpora since most of the content of the attributed material was overtly evaluative. Conversely, indirect cases of evaluation were harder to identify. I gathered under the ‘invoked’ category (‘In context’) those which are not evaluative on the surface, but become so against the frame of our socio-politico-cultural background, that is to say purely informational statements which in context make us react and pass judgement. Some illustrative examples are:

(7) Mr Jagland, reading the citation, said China’s new status in the world ‘must entail increased responsibility’. (BBC1.6)   
(8) ‘They censored what I’ve just posted on micro blog! Can you really stop people in this Internet age!’ wrote another [twitterer]. (CNN1.33)

In these examples, in addition to communicating the primary content of these quotations, the writer is conveying something else and expects the readership to react to them attitudinally. In example (7), Mr Jagland is politely telling us of a new duty we should acquire, thereby a duty which is not being performed now, while in example (8) the twitterer is complaining about the lack of freedom in China to post his views on the event.

Within the ‘other’ category, shown in Table 8, I included neutral statements and expressions of emotions by the speakers which did not count as evaluations, such as Mr Liu’s wife:

Such cases did not occur in the Chinese corpus, where the attributed material was exclusively used to discredit Liu and the whole event.

As for the content of the evaluations made by the external voices, these were in direct opposition in both corpora. In the Chinese corpus, each of their quotations included negative evaluations of Mr Liu and/or his deeds, of the Nobel Peace Prize award, of the Nobel committee and even of the Western world. Conversely, almost all forms of evaluations in its Western counterpart appraised the same realities positively. However, these reports also added voices expressing negative evaluations and concerns about China’s policies and/or its reaction to the award. These instances of evaluation were not quantified since, as mentioned above, their forms, value and intensity of appraisal varied so greatly that they could not be quantified and compared with each other.

# Discussion

After the analysis, it may be suggested confidently that although the story was presented quite differently in both corpora, its reporting proved highly evaluative on both sides. Likewise, it can be argued that the greatest amount of appraisal in both corpora was uttered by external voices, whose formulations – both paraphrased and transcribed ‘literally’ – proved heavily loaded, bearing strong expressions of appraisal, about Mr Liu and the award. It looks as if journalists, on either side of the news, relied equally heavily on quotations as a way to appraise and thus endorse or disendorse the whole event or certain aspects of it (see White, 1997, 1998, 2006). While the Western corpus displayed a larger variety of external voices, the Chinese reports showed a much higher proportion of quoted material, but this coming chiefly from a single source representing the voice of the government in the face of the award. The limited intervention of the writer in the Chinese stories suggests that journalists have very little say in pieces of news somehow pertaining to political matters. It is notable that in reports on this side of the corpus, there was complete omission of the Nobel foundation’s official announcement of the award which was literally quoted in all Western newspapers.

Reports from both sides were characterized by their one-sidedness, but while the Chinese corpus included only material against the award, reports in the West, in addition to their support for the award and Mr Liu, also included some of Mr Ma’s remarks which run contrary to their own position. However, this side of the news was equally biased. Apart from Mr Ma’s words, no other comments against the award or Mr Liu were encountered, and this inclusion was more to highlight the Chinese government’s position, and indirectly criticize it, than to introduce a note of objectivity. On these grounds, we go back to Scollon’s view that quotations may be used to assess the speaker him/herself. This seems to be the case here, where Mr Ma’s quotes place him in a very negative standing. In my data, for example, Mr Ma’s words are emotionally loaded with strong negative assessments, which, from the Western perspective, may seem out of proportion for the event, as in:

(10) The Nobel committee’s decision to award such a person the peace prize ran contrary to and desecrated the prize, he said. (PDO1.8)   
(11) Ma said … awarding of the prize to Liu was ‘blasphemy against the peace prize’ … (CNN1.12)

Such emotionally loaded statements may serve very different purposes on both sides of the story; while they reflect the Chinese government’s strong disagreement with the prize – and thus try to pass this on to the Chinese readers – they may also serve the opposite function in the Western world, where their inclusion may discredit the speaker and place readers against him and the system he represents.

This ties in with the writer’s intentions when using certain material and his/her assumptions of shared background knowledge with the readership, who are expected to interpret the text as the author intended it. Different values and cultural assumptions may result in the reading of different meanings from the same statements. Thus, while the example in the BBC excerpt below (12) is criticizing the Chinese system, its counterpart from the Chinese corpus (13) serves as the reason for the Chinese to justify Mr Liu’s imprisonment:

(12) Last year he received an 11-year sentence for ‘inciting subversion’ after drafting Charter 08 – which called for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China. (BBC1.11)   
(13) Liu was sentenced to 11 years in jail last December 25 after a local court in Beijing convicted him of agitation aimed at subverting the government. (CD1.3)

Both excerpts denote basically the same reasons for Liu’s imprisonment, but in the Chinese case these serve to justify the sentence, while in the West – where freedom of expression is a respected value – it serves to condemn the Chinese system. Via these valuations, the Chinese writer expects to trigger negative attitudes towards Liu Xiaobo and the Nobel Prize, while the Western writer attempts to trigger negative attitudes towards the Chinese government for such a reaction.

Naturally, journalists do have positions and do take sides – and this can hardly be disguised. The inclusion of attributed comments may appear externally to be a form of objectivity of the journalist, but deep down it serves him/her as a good way to get involved. Arguably, the appraising role lies mostly in the external voices but, even if sources do most of the evaluation, their words do not work completely by themselves. The overall framing of the story and journalists’ support or challenge of such material unveils understated dispositions which may be the best way to make their own points and pass judgements almost unnoticeably.

# Notes

1. In this article, I use the terms appraisal and evaluation interchangeably, although each of these terms has been adopted by different models with some difference in their meanings: appraisal by the Appraisal Model and evaluation by Thompson and Hunston (2000).   
2. Although Sinclair presents these categories as a yes/no paradigm, the problem is more complex than that. The model has been developed further to show that this sharp division is not always the case (e.g. Caldas-Coulthard, 1994; Stubbs, 1996; Hunston, 2000). They argue that very often the distinction is not as clear-cut as it looks, since every attribution is also averred.   
3. On these lines, White claims that quotations in news reports often ‘introduce all manners of accusations, criticisms, demands and contentious claims on the part of the experts, politicians, community leaders, interested parties, eye-witnesses, victims and so on’ (White, 2006: 57).   
4. For an introduction to the Appraisal Model, see Martin (2000); Martin and White (2005); Text 23(3) [special issue on Appraisal Theory]; and the Appraisal website at www.grammatics. com/appraisal   
5. For the sake of style and to avoid over repetition, I use the words ‘appraisal’ and ‘evaluation’ interchangeably here, despite not being synonyms and in spite of different traditions having adopted each term, e.g. Thompson and Hunston (2000) as opposed to Appraisal Theory.

8. The announcement of the award made by the Nobel Prize committee can still be found online at: http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2010/announcement.html. On the other hand, the remarks of Mr Ma, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman, can be found in the Question & Answers press conference at www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/t759708. htm or www.chinamission.be/eng/fyrth/t762394.htm. There is no official recognition (in English at least) of the award by the Chinese government, not even condemning it.   
9. In this respect, this somehow contradicts Caldas-Coulthard (1994), who argues for ‘quoting’ and ‘reporting’ work as ideological tools since they reveal some form of the author’s interference in order to reproduce what is ideologically most convenient for him/her.
