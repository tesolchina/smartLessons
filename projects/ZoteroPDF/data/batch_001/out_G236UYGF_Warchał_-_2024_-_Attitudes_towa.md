Although the impact of English as a language of science on other languages and communities has been discussed from various perspectives, it has less often been explored in Slavic contexts. This paper analyses the attitudes of Polish linguists towards English for research publication, with special attention to its perceived impact on the discipline, language, and academic careers as well as perceived risks and benefits it entails in these areas. The analysis follows a mixed method design based on data from a survey at Polish universities and interviews. The results show that in comparison to other cultural contexts, more participants perceived the status of English as a threat to locally relevant research and as an unfair advantage to L1 English scholars. The main risk areas include academic practices, locally relevant research agendas, and cooperation with regions where English is not a commonly known language; the main benefits, access to recent findings, broader research perspective, and wider audience. Respondents identified the source of the problems with policies that seal the status of English as the language of science, affecting locally relevant research and disciplinary practices and contributing to the sense of disadvantage associated primarily with manifold costs incurred by publishing in English.

# 1. Introduction

Over the past decades, the impact of the dominance of English in research publication on communities and individual scholars has been discussed from three overlapping persectives. One considers itseffect on academic vrietes of national languages and potential diglossia, possbly leading to domain oss (Budrewicz et al., 2010; Ferguson, 2007; Ljosland, 2007). Another perpective points to its possible effect on locally relevant disciplinary research: since some topics or data are not perceived as attractive to international English-language joumals and audiences, L2 English scholars may les often address them despite their significance to national communities (Duszak & Lewkowicz, 2008; Neff 2018; Ostrowski, 2020). Finally, atention has been drawn to the position of L2 English scholars, who spend more money, time, and effort to join global (i.e., English-language) cience - often publishing intensively for local national communities - or who for economic or geopolitical reasons remain excluded (Curry & ilis, 2004; illis and Curry, 2010; Soler, 2021). One important question that emerges from these three perspectives concerns attitudes towards English for research publication.

One of the most significant studies into the perception of English as the language of science - focused specificall on the sense of unfairness and disadvantage - is Ferguson et al. (2011). Based on a survey among Spanish academics, the authors established that while a vast majorit of respondents perceived the dominance of English as an advantage to L1 English scholars, only about hlf viewed this advantage as unfair. Additionally, a majority perceived themselves as advantaged rather than disadvantaged by English. In a related study (Muresan & Perez-Llantada, 2014), an analysis of questionnaires ille in by Romanian scholars in the field of economic studies revealed that over $5 0 \%$ of the respondents disagreed with the statement that the dominance of English gives unfair advantage to L1 English scholars and almost two-thirds perceived themselves as advantaged rather than disadvantaged. Another study, set in the context of Swedish higher education and academia, reports that over $5 0 \%$ of survey participants perceived the dominance of English as an unfair advantage to Anglophone academics and nearly half of the humanities scholars saw it as a threat to academic Swedish, but only a small prcentage felt personall disadvantaged (Bolton & Kuteva, 2012). The icture that emerges from these studies is one of mixed perceptions, with the feling of being personally advantaged dominating over the sense of disadvantage.

The studies mentioned above - carried out at the time of internationalisation of European universities and implementation of policies to make them globally competitive - come from welldefined and diverse settings. Ferguson et al. (2011) is set in a largely monolingual context, with a large population of L1 Spanish speakers around the world and Spanish among the most common languages learnt as L2. The results then represent the perspective of users of another global language that enables international cooperation and whose tatus is not afected by the dominance of English. The study by Bolton and Kuteeva (2012) focuses on a context where English has long been established as a medium of instruction in higher education and used extensively for research publication; Kuteeva & McGrath, 2014). Sweden, together with other Nordic countrie, adopted policies to protect the status of national languages and languages essential to society" as early as in 2006, efforts continued in the 2024 edition of the Declaration on Nordic Language Policy (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2006, 2024), which fers a framework for fostering the vitality of and interest in the languages of the Nordic Region. It als strongly promotes a parallel use of languages - various local languages and English - in science and education to prevent diglossia and exclusion and to promote multilingualism in an essentially multilingual region (Nordic Council f Ministers, 2018). The Romanian context of Muresan and Perez-Llantada (2014), while linguistically homogeneous, is marked by positive atitudes to foreign language learning, with at least two foreign languages taught at the secondary level. The Polish context in which the present study is set is partly similar. For almost $9 5 \%$ of the population, Polish is the only language spoken at home,' and the core currculum for secondary education includes two freign languages.? At the same time, however, in 2016, almost one-third of the adult population declared no knowledge, and $4 5 \%$ , an elementary knowledge of a foreign language. Another important aspect of the Polish context is that Polish scholarship was strongly influenced by German academic culture (Duszak, 1994), with German til holding a relatively strong position in some humanities disciplines (Warchal & Zakrajewski, 2024). Next, until the political transformation of 1989, contacts with the West were discouraged and accessto English limite, situation that affected scholars who are now the most experienced academics. Finall, recent reforms and evaluation systems have inroduced new factors to consider when choosing a language of publication, discussed in more details in Section 2.1. A question that emerges is to what extent the results of other studies apply to the Polis situation - and other Central and Eastern European countries that share these experiences - and what themes emerge in the study of attitudes in this specific context.

This study focuses on lingusts, representatives of a discipline inherently oriented towards linguistic diversty, where the choice of publication language often follows from a specific area of study. Compared to representatives of natural sciences, scholars in soft disciplines have been found to be more sensitive to the social and ideological considerations involved in the language choice (Benet, 2013; De Swan, 2001). till studies on the practices and attitudes of inguists have been comparativel rare. Previous reearch has shown that in this group, the main determinants of the publication language choice are the object of study and the target audience (Omrcen & Bautovic, 2021; Schluer, 2014), and that publication practices vary widely, ranging from monolingual publishing (often not in the author's first language) to strongly multilingual publication patterns, with publications in languages other than L1 often comprising a large proportion of the output (Warchal & Zakrajewski, 2024). This intinsic diversity of the discipline and its entrenchment in local communities and cultures make it an interesting object of study in terms of the atitudes towards English for research publication purposes.

The aim of this study is to provide results on an underresearched national group that enable comparison with previous studies and may help design context-tailored policies to foster both internationalisation of research and multilingual dissemination practice in fields where research is strongly embedded in languages, cultures, and communities. The guiding questions of this analysis are: What is the perception of the impact of English on research communication, study areas, and individual scholars and what are its main de terminants in the Polish context? How do Polish linguists position themselves towards the dominance of English in research publi cation? For the study, a mixed method approach was adopted (reswell & Creswell 2018), based on a subset of data from a survey of Polish social sciences and humanitie cholars carried out at 20 Polish higher education institutions (Warchal & Zakrajewski, 2023) and data from interviews with linguists affiliated with one of these universities.

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. The context of study

Afer the political transformation of 1989, Polish universities were oriented towards teaching rather than research (Kwiek, 2015) The first large-scale attempt to change this trend came with the reforms of 2010-2012, which aimed at restoring research to its central position: they emphasised the value of publications in indexed international journals, now the main criterion in national level evaluation procedures, funding systems, and promotion paths. Kulczycki (2017) draws attention to the following problems at ths stage of reforms: ibliometric indicators disadvantaged softsciences by ignoring the publication pattrns characteristic of these disciplines; emphasis on publishing in international indexed journals led to depreciation of publications in Polish; and the evaluation based to a large extent on the Web of Science, which, again, put soft disciplines at a disadvantaged position.

The latest science and higher education reform is the Constitution for Science (2018). It specifies, among others, that research activities arealuatd on the basis of mesurableachievements, such as scientific monographs and articles published in journal listed "in the international databases f the scientific journals with the broadest coverage" (Art. 265.1.9). Publications are awarded points according to the publishing house or journal where they appear, and the list of journals (with assgned points) is compiled and announced by the minister. In its original hape, the list raised controversies similar to those voiced in the earlier tage of reforms it prioritised international, top-rank, mostly English-medium journals and publishing companies. Since 2019, the ist has been modified several times, with the changes criticised for, among others, destabilising work conditions and negatively impacting research work.

Apart from central funding allocated to universities according to evaluation results, research is funded through grants. The largest government grant agency in Poland is the National Science Centre (NN). Specific criteria for grant allocation depend on the scheme, with major funding paths basing in $4 0 \%$ on research achievements of the principal investigator: "excellent, internationally recognized and highly valued though n rfenc is madtothe lgage f publicatio, the critriar sier to met f he rerh record includes publications in languages other than Polish. Research-oriented policies at the institutional level diffr, with universities setting specific promotion criteria and incentives, including interal funding schemes for research activities based on scholars recent achievements. For example, at a large public universt, scholars are rewarded for publishing in Web of Science- and Scopus-indexed journals that areassigned the greatest number of points on the ministerial it, and a pro-quality programme offers additional funding for international research activities. The participation in the programme i competitive and based on the recent publication record (presented, wherever possible, with the IF). The beneficiaries of the programme are require, among others, to publish an article in one of the two top cateories f the ministeril lit or publish with aco-author ffliated with the rceiving university. There is no mention of the language of publication, but the evaluation criteria and the expected outcomes often assume using languages other than Polish.

# 2.2. The survey

The survey was designed following Ferguson et al. (2011), Bolton and Kuteeva (2012), and Muresan and Perez-Llantada (2014) The participants were scholars afiliated with the social ciences and humanities (ssH) units of 20 Polish universities that took part in the Excellence Initiative - Research Universty competition, a funding programme launched in 2019 by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (now Ministry of Education and Science). The data collection tool was a Google Form-based questionnaire comprising 52 items aranged in three thematic lines: multiligual publication practices, the roleof English in reearch dissemination, and attitudes to English as the global language of science. This study is based on responses to items from the third line.

The link to the questionnaire was distributed via email in October 2020 and remained open for five weeks. The response rate approximated $^ { 1 3 \% }$ which is rather low but not unusual for this kind of survey (Ferguson et al., 2011). Of the 1525 forms that qualified for further analysis, this study focuses on 221 submitted by linguis: 63 males, 156 females, and 2 respondents who did not reveal thir gender. All respondents declared Polish as their first language.

In terms of academic seniority, the largest group were PhD holders $( 4 8 \% )$ , followed by habilitation holders (henceforth associate professors, $3 3 \%$ ) and two much smaller groups of MA holders and full professors (10 and $9 \%$ , respectively). The majority of the respondents published in two and $2 5 \%$ in three languages prior to the survey (Table 1). As much as $9 4 \%$ of the respondents used Polish as a publication language, and $7 4 \%$ used English. English was used for publication purposes by the vast majority of respondents who declared publishing in three or more languages and by $7 0 \%$ of scholars who published in two languages. As much as $4 4 \%$ of linguists who published in one language used English.

The analysis that follows focuses on the responses to five questionnaire items, to which the participants were asked to react on a five-point Likert scale. The first two items were included to provide information about the perceived impact of English on locally important research and the academic variety of Polish; Q3 asked about the perceived unfairness of the dominance of English to L2 English scholars Q4 elicited views on the need for one intenational language of science, and Q5 asked about the respondents personal

sense of (dis)advantage associated with the status of English. Q1 and Q2 follow Bolton and Kuteeva (2012); Q3-Q5, Ferguson et al.   
(2011).

The data collected in the survey were analysed statistically to determine whether there was a significant assciation between the responses to Q1-Q5 and the following variables: academic seniority (as informative about the scholar's research and publication experience), the number f publication languages (as informatie about the degre of multilingualism in research dissemination), the self-perceived proficiency in English (as informative about the ease of using English in research activities, and the use of English. language literature (as informative about the role of English-language publications in research work). First, descriptive statistics were calculated for the variable of interest. Next, because the data did not meet the assumptions of parametric tests, the KruskalWallis test was used to examine the relationship between the responses to Q1-Q5 and academic seniority (for four independent seniority groups), and the Mann-Whitney $U$ test with continuity correction was applied to examine the association between the responses and the number of publication languages, the self-perceived proficiency in English, and the use of English-language literature (each variable comprising two independent groups, Table 2). The results were considered statistically significant at $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$

# 2.3. The interviews

To gain a better understanding of the attitudes and publication decisions of Polish linguists, in July and August 2023, semistructured interviews were conducted with ten scholars affliated with the University of Silesia in Katowice. All participants were interviewed in Polish by the author; three interviews took place online; the rest, onsite. On average, an interview lasted about $4 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ Invitations to participate in the study were sent to scholars at ifferent stage f acadmic carer, from doctoratt fll profssorship, working in different areas of inguistics and with different languages and language families (Polish, German, Slavonic, and Romance studies). Because the interviews focused on multilingual practices in the context of the dominance of English, scholars whose main language area was English were not included in the interview group to avoid bias. The response rateto interview invitations was about $7 0 \%$ The interviews followed an open-ended format, with a set f guiding questions prepared in advanceto provide a general direction to the conversation, and focused on the languages the interviewees used in different academic situations, their motivations for the language choice, multilingual experience with journals as authors and editors, and the impact of English on their research area and personal academic career (see S1 in Supplementary material).

The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed using Whisper AI, an open-source AI tool (6 h of recorded material; about 41,000 words). The analysis of the data was caried out by the author with the help of QDA Miner 6. The transcripts were manually checked for accuracy, pseudonymised, and subjected to thematic analysis following Boyatzis (1998). First, deductie coding was applied based on previous iterature and the focus of the interview (e.g., motivations for choosing a publication language); next, inductive coding was used based on what emerged from the data (e.g, eclipse of post-conference volumes) (Dornyei, 2007). The analysis included both the manifest level (eg., taking tance on the need for an intenational language of science) and the latent level (e.g., the sense of exclusion). The process was iterative and circular until no further modifications were introduced.

The group of participants comprised three PhD holder, five associate professor, and two full professor seven female and three male scholars). Table 3 presents the information about the participants (LOP - language other than Polish).

As can be seen in Table 3, throughout their academic careers, the interviewees published in 2-6 languages; allof them published in Polish, and seven used English for research publication. The use of English for publication cannot be taken as evidence of high English language proficiency. English-language publication strategies reported by the interviewes included using professional translation services, own translation from Polish, writing directly in English, having the text edited before submission, and working with a coauthor.

Bearing in mind the second question guiding this analysis, the discussion of interview results focuses on the following themes: the impact of English on the interviewee's area of study, academic practices, and his or her research career and the need for a shared language of science. Considerations of impact wl help explore survey items Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q5, and views on a shared language of science will offer additional perspective on Q4.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Survey results

As shown in Table 4, the first three statements - about potential threats associated with the status of English and the unfair advantage it offered to L1 English scholars - drew largely similar reactions: over $6 0 \%$ of the respondents expressed (moderate) agreement and $2 0 { - } 2 4 \%$ expressed (moderate) disagreement. The pattern is different in the case of the other two items. In Q4, a similar number of respondents agreed and disagreed with the statement that there was a need for one shared language in scholarly communication (45 and $4 1 \%$ respectively), while in Q5, the most personal item on the list, the number of the respondents who expressed (moderate) agreement with the statement was almost the same as the number of those who chose to remain neutral (39 and $3 8 \%$ respectively). Below, we look more closely at the responses by different participant groups. Descriptive statistics are attached as Supplementary material (s2).

As for Q1 (The emphasis on publishing in English may impoverish locally important research in my discipline), the predisposition to agree with the statement grew with academic seniority, from $3 9 \%$ (cumulative percentage for agreement and moderate agreement) in MA holders to $7 2 \%$ in full professors. MA holders - less experienced members of the disciplinary community - marked the neutral response more frequently than other academics. Respondents who declared fair or lower English-language proficiency expressed (moderate) agreement with Q1 more frequently than those whose self-reported proficiency was good or very good (80 and $5 6 \%$ respectively). Similarly, $8 2 \%$ of the respondents who declared limited use of English-language texts agreed or rather agreed with Q1, as contrasted with $5 1 \%$ of those who relied on English-language literature to a greater extent. Scholars who published in three or more languages expressed agreement with Q1 more often than those with one or two publication languages (S3). As for the assciation between the responses to Q1 and academic seniority, the results of the Kruskal-Wallis tet provide no grounds for rejecting the nul hypothesis (lack of significant differences in the distribution of responses in the four groups of respondents). With regard to the other variables, the results of the Mann-Whitney $U$ test show a significant association between the responses to Q1 and the self-perceived proficiency in English $( \mathrm { Z } = - 4 . 2 3 , \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ and the use of English-language literature $\mathbf { Z } = - 5 . 7 2$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; S8-S9).

For $6 1 \%$ of the respondents, incentives and pressures on scholars to disseminate their research results in English were a potential threat to academic Polish (Q2). The responses did not diffr much with academic seniority, although, as in Q1, the youngest researchers were considerably les likely to agree with the statement than the other groups and selected the neutral response more frequently than others. As for the other factors, the observed differences are rather smal, with respondents who published in three or more languages, reported lower levels of English-language proficiency, or used English-language literature to a limited extent more ofen seeing theemphasis on English as a potential threat to Polish than the other groups (\$4). The results of the Kruskal-Wallistes do not indicate significant differences in the distribution of responses to Q2 in the four seniority groups. The reults of the Mann-Whitney

Table 4 Responses to Q1-Q5.

$U$ test show a significant association between the responses to Q2 and the use of English-language literature $( \mathrm { Z } = - 3 . 1 1$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 2$ S8-S9).

Responses to Q3 show that an overwhelming majority of the participants perceived L1 English scholars as unfairly advantaged by the status of English as a language of science $7 1 \%$ of positive responses). The predisposition to agree with this statement grew with academic seniority, from $4 8 \%$ in MA holders to $8 1 \%$ in full professors. Unlike in Q1 and Q2, MA holders did not differ considerably from the other groups in the number of neutral responses, aparently feeing more secure in their opinions than in the case of items concerned directly with disciplinary practices. These results may be related to two factors. First, young scholars have had more exposure to English than academics who studied and worked on their doctoral projects 30 years ago; s  result, they may perceive the difficulties related to communicating reearch in English as an additional anguage as les severe, possibly as a challenge rather than a barrier (cf. Duszak & Lewkowicz, 2008). Second, more seasoned scholars are likely to have had more experience with submitting manuscripts to international ournals, and hence more encounters with their gate-keeping systems. Asa result, their responses may be informed by reallife experience rather than expectations. As for the other variables, scholars who published in three or more languages, declared fair or lower English-language proficiency, or used English-language literature to a limited extent expressed (moderate) agreement with Q3 more frequently than the other groups and were much les inclined to disagree with it than other scholars (S5). As for the association between the responses to Q3 and academic seniority, the results of the Kruskal-Walls test demonstrate a significant difference between the responses by fullprofessors and MA holders (I $\mathrm { ~ I ~ } ( 3 , \mathrm { N } = 2 2 1 ) = 8 . 3 5$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 3 9 \mathrm { , }$ . The results of the Mann-Whitney $U$ test reject the null hypotheses in all cases, showing that there is a significant association between the perception of the dominant poition of English as an unfair advantage to L1 English scholars and the number of publication languages $( Z = - 2 . 2 1$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 2 7 \mathrm { , }$ , the self-perceived proficiency in English $( \mathrm { Z } = - 3 . 4 7 $ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 1 $ , and the use of English-language literature (Z $= - 3 . 6 6$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; S8-S9).

Less agrement was noticed for Q4 (there is a need for one shared language in scholarly communication), with almost equal number of participants expressing (moderate) agreement and (moderate) disagreement with the statement (45 and $4 1 \%$ , respectively). MA holders tended to agree with the statement more often than other seniority groups. Respondents who published in one or two languages, reported good or very good English-language proficiency, or stated that over $2 5 \%$ of the research they cited was in English gave responses that were closer to the positive end of the scale than the other groups (6). As for theassociation between the responses to Q4 and academic seniority, the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test provide no grounds for rejecting the ull hypothesis. The resultsof the Mann-Whitney $U$ test demonstrate a significant association between the opinions on the need for one shared language in scholarly communication and the number of publication languages : $\mathbf { Z } = 3 . 3 3$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \mathrm { ; } }$ I, the self-perceived proficiency in English $\mathbf { Z } = - 4 . 3 8 ,$ p $< 0 . 0 0 1 \dot { }$ , and the use of English-language literature $( \mathbf { Z } = - 6 . 0 0$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; S8-S9).

Opinions were also divided on Q5, the most personal item on the list: $3 9 \%$ of the respondents (rather) agreed that they were advantaged rather than disadvantaged by the position of English as the international language of science, $2 3 \%$ (rather) disagreed, and as many as $3 8 \%$ remained neutral (as contrasted with $9 { - } 1 5 \%$ in Q1-Q4). The responses did not differ much across seniority groups, with PhD holders expressng (moderate) agrement with the statement somewhat les frequently than the other groups and MA holders being least likely to (moderately) disagree with the statement. As for the other variables, much like in Q4, scholars who published in one or two languages, reported good or very good English-language proficiency, or used English-language literature more extensively expressed (moderate) agreement with Q5 more frequently than other respondents (S7). The results of the Kruskal-Walli test do not indicate significant differences in the distribution of responses to Q5 across seniority groups. As for the number of publication languages, the self-perceived proficiency in English, and the use of English-language literature, the results of the Mann-Whitney $U$ test reject the null hypotheses and show a significant association between the responses and the selected variables $Z = 2 . 0 9$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 3 7 ;$ Z $= - 4 . 7 4$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; and ${ \sf Z } = - 6 . 4 4$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ , respectively; S8-S9).

This part of the analysis can be summarised as follows. Over $6 0 \%$ of the respondents perceived the high status of English as potentially harmful to their research area and academic Polish, and over $7 0 \%$ , as a factor unfairly advantaging L1 English scholars. These opinions stand in contrast to the perceptions of the impact of English on personal academic development, with only $2 3 \%$ of the surveyed declaring that i their case, this impact was negative. Almost the same number of respondents agred and disagreed with the statement that there was a need for one shared language in science communication.

Academic seniority proved important in determining the perception of the dominance of English as an unfair advantage to L1 English scholars, with the most experienced researchers concurring with this view significantly more frequently than the youngest academics. This finding brings to mind Salo's (2017) observations on the perceived role of English-language publishing among his torians in Sweden, where, in contrast to senior academics, younger scholars tend to see it as a reasonable and desirable strategy to further their academic carrs. The number of publication languages acted as a determinant of the responses to three items. Compared to respondents who published in one or two languages, participants who had thre or more publication languages were significantly more likely to agree with the statement that the dominant position of English gave an unfair advantage to L1 English scholars and to disagree with the statement that there was a need for one shared language in scholarly communication. Also, their reactions to Q5 (being personall advantaged rather than disadvantaged) were significantly closer to the negative end of the scale. The self-declared English-language proficiency was a successful predictor of the responses to four items. Participants who declared good or higher English-language proficiency were significantly les ikely to agree with the tatement that the emphasis on publishing in English could impoverish locally important research than those whose self-reported proficiency in English was lower. They were also significantly less likely to agre that the dominant position of English gave an unfair advantage to L1 Englis scholars but more likely to agree that there was a need for one shared language of science and that they were advantaged rather than disadvantaged by English.

Finally, the use of English-language literature proved an important determining factor in allfive cases. Respondents who declared that English-language literature comprised more than one-fourth of the works they cited were signficantly les likely to agree with the statements that the emphasis on publishing in English could impoverish locally important research or the academic variety of Polish than those who used English-language liteature to esser extent They were lso es ikely to perceive the dominance of English as an unfair advantage to 1 English scholars and tended to select responses that were significantl closer to the affirmative end of the scale when asked about the need for one shared language of science and the sense of personal advantage.

# 3.2.Interview results

The analysis of the interviews identified four recurrent themes: problems posed by the status of English as a language of science. mixed perceptions of the impact of English on the research area and research careers, rejecting the feling of being dominated by English, and mixed views on the need for a shared language of science..

Problems posed by the status of English as a language of sience. One concern expressed by interviewees was that used as a means to describe other languages, English might impose its own categories and ush them further into the peripheries. One interviewe felt that

Slavic languages were in particular at risk of marginalisation and biased description, whichfor her was a source of frustration (1). As another interviewee pointed out, in experimental research, stmulus material isoften selected with the English language in mind and has to betransferred into Polih, where it oten functions differentl (). Anther source f concen was tht the mphasis on nglish in research publication might be detrimental to academic practices. One participant expressed her impatience at reviewers pointing out the lack of English-language sources in the bibliographies of studies that had no obvious reason to refer to them (3). Affected is also participation in non-English dominant conferences - acording to the interviewees, important venues for academic discussion, collaboration, and support - because the emphasis on journal articles discourages scholars from contributing to post-conference volumes. As one interviewee put is, \*in order to meet the requirements of the publication policy, I would have to limit myself to journals; there simply isn't enough time for conferences anymore' [P10]. Another participant was particularly critical about the situation, pointing out that by marginalising post-conference volumes, the scholarly community loses an important source of focused, relevant information (4). Finally, some participants observed that in the case of Polish or, more generaly, Slavic studies conferences abroad, ntroducing English as a conference language would be detrimental to international cooperation. As one respondent pointed out, such events ften bring together scholars from regions where English is not a commonly known language and who communicat in the shared language(s) they study. None of the interviewees referred to English posing a threat to the Polish language.

1. A third language would be acertain filte at times. [.] Slavic anguages in general, are very niche languages, cultures. If we put English on top of that, then at that point we force them even more to the periphery. This is also a certain frustration for me. $[ \mathrm { P 1 0 } ] ^ { 8 }$   
2. [Ther i the problem of ..] experiments. As we know, Englis is est studid in this respect Polish has its own pecliaritie here. [.. For example, garden-path sentences in English have these famous past participle, so now how to convert i into Polis?[] The importance of the active and passive voice in English and in Polish is different. [P02]   
3. [In a review of agrant proposal] a PhD student received a comment that he did not cite publications in English. Well[.., why would he have them at this point? He neither aplied for cholarship stays in English-speaking countres nor did he do research on translation into English. [.. It would make sense o point out tht [..] there was a [specific] source he was not familiar with it, then such a remark would be helpful. [P05]   
4. I am furious at the way post-conference books are treated [.. I look for post-conference volumes, because I know that this con. ference gathered people who really know their stuff.[..] These are actually reearch articles but they give us les credit. [P01]

Mixed perceptions of the impact of English on the research area and academic carer. The majority of participants emphasised the formative role of English-language research in their fields, acknowledging it with various emotions, ranging from resignation (5) to appreciation (6), or even enthusiasm (7). One interviewee revealed that through English, she gained aces to iterature on problems understudied in Polish, developed a broader perspective (an aspect apreciated by her reviewers), and gained asource of inspiration to define new research questions.

5. Cognitive linguistics [ ...] is primarily English-language, so okay, well, what do I do? [P07]   
6. In my are, absolutely so it has mpact n rearch and the issemination of results]; I think therei no doubt here.  se it as] an opportunity for development, [ .. its a tool to reach as large an audience as possible, and the fact that Italian, French, German centres and so on also use English simply enables them to reach more potential external stakeholders [..] who can support them, or simply other centres. [P04]   
7. Theory, methodology, tols, its a from there [the Eglish-speaking world]. [ .] ther is more gratitude in me for what they hae iven us [... I understand [ .] that for orpus inguis, Englishi th irst lnguage. For one thing I'm glad that ll these thing happened in English at all. [P03]

At the same time, some participants shared their daunting experiences with publishing in English, pointing out the amount of time spent on writing in English, the cost of profesional proofreading, and the endlesslanguage revisions which distracted them from other research projects. I addition, one participant observed that while he appreciated English-medium access o recent indings, the institutional emphasis on research dissemination - also through English - distracted him from research work. As he put it \*it's an ambivalent thing, and it both hinders and helps, depending on what we're talking about" [P02]. Another interviewee regretted not being able to participate in a focused conference concerned with his language area when he discovered that the conference language was English. On another occasion, conference organisers acceted presentations in any Slavic language, but planned a post-conference publication in English, which also discouraged one of the respondent from participating. These observations indicate that the impact of English on the participants' carers is perceived with mixed emotions, as both enabling disciplinary development and limiting research possibilities.

Rejecting the feeling of being dominated by English. In this case, two divergent subthemes were identified. On the one hand, the majority of participants perceived the impact of English in terms of broadening the research perspective or strengthening the moti. vation for slf-development (8), explicitly rejecting the experience of being overwhelmed, dominated, or threatened. As one interviewee put it, \*we don't take it as a threat, we take it as an inspiration for further research" [08]. On the other hand, for some participants, the impact of English on thir scholarly development and research area was not so strong as to speak of dominance. One interviewee observed that i terms of academic development, she was strongly influenced by one English-language text recommended to her by a colleague but was not convinced that she owed much to English as such. Two others declared that English had a limited or no effect on their immediate area of interes or aademic careers. One felt no need to publish in English, although she used English in international contacts when German, her main publication language, did not work (9). Her recent English-language publication resulted from the editor's decision informed by evaluation policies. The other, lavic language specialist, admitted that she had never felt the need to addres her audience in English. The interviewee aso questioned the idea of English being the \*universal language of science," pointing out that in some research areas, the role of international language is played by the language that is the object of study. These two contrasting motivation for rejecting the feeing of being dominated by English suggest that English as alanguage of scholarly communication i percived either as conducive to research and development or, in some areas of study, as inapplicable. The latter perspective challenges the idea f English as the language f cience and, on a more geral level, rases questions about the need for one shared language of science.

8. I didnt reall feel the domnance that much. ow thee's this pressure  an points .] but its had more f a mobilising efect on me. [...] So, I've actually started to read more in English. [P05] 9. [English] certainly does not play a dominating role, but it is indispensable, indispensable for sure. [P06]

Mixed views on the need for one shared language of science. Perceptions on the need for a shared language of scholarly communication were mixed, ranging from straghtforward acknowledgement, through resigned accptance, to ambivalent feelings. Some participant pointed out that science had always used a common language and that these languages had changed across history, so the current position of English should not be seen as extraordinary, permanent, o alarming (10). Others, inturn, took a more nuanced view of the situation. While they did not reject the need for one shared language of science, they expressed doubts whether it was common to all disciplines and field. Referring pecifically to linguistics, one interviewee observed that although one common language facilitated research in some areas, such as inguistic typology, in other cases, it was unnecessary, as intenational coperation was carried out in the language of study. Particularly revealing was the response of another participant, who pointed to the context-bound nature of the humanities and their intrinsic connection with specific communities and languages (11). In doing so, she shared her deep concern about multilingualism in science and her pessimism about the impact of current policies on multilingual research communication.

10. That's the order of things. .] When we look at the world, there as always been lingua franca [. I'm not going to change it, I'm not going to make a revolution, I accept it [...]. I have no problem with that. [P07]   
11. This is a very complicated question because science is not uniform, is it? There is a diffrent way of doing research in the sciences [..] and a different way of doing reearch in the umanitie, beause they are aways local [..] they always reflect the cultural baggage of the author and the context where they function, so I don't know, really. But I think that without intitutional incentives, without creating the right conditions, national languages [in science] cannot be defended. Such an institutional nail in the coffin for the French language is that of the best French-language journals published in France, [.] none gt the highest number of points on the list. [P09]

In summary, among problems associated with the status of English as a language of science, participants drew attention to the possible bias resulting from studying other languages through the means of English as well as its detrimental ffect on academic practices and international communication in non-English dominant geographical and reearch areas. Mixed perceptions of the impact of English on the research area and personal career were another important theme, with participants viewing it as both stimulating scholarly development and restricting their research activitie. Importantly, interview participants declared that they did not feel dominated by English. This perception was associated with either of two perspectives: viewing English as asource of inspiration rather than burden and threat or viewing the role of English as limited. Finall, the idea of one shared language of science evoked mixed reactions, from complet accetance to ambivalent felings combined with concerns about the future of other languages in scholarly communication.

# 4. Discussion

This paper looked into the atitudes of Polish linguists towards English for research publication, with special attention to its perceived mpact on the diciline, anguage, and acadmic caers, theris and befits i entals in thee as, and th ned for one language of science. The study has shown that the position of English was perceived as a threat to locally relevant research and/or to Polish by over $6 0 \%$ of survey respondents, with field-specific research and disciplinary practices identified by interview participants as the most vulnerable areas. Used as a means to analyse other languages, English was seen as a possible source of bias, leading to some aspects of their structure and use being overooked, ignored, or misrepresented. Combined with pressures imposed by the evaluation system to publish in top-rank international journals, this may lead to locall important research problems being abandoned, oversimplified, or marginalised as uninteresting to global audience, a scenario known from other contexs and disciplines. Neff (2018) has shown how pushing Mexican ecologists to publish in English-language journals affected the topics and methods of study, prioritising research that was more relatable for international audiences but lessuseful for the society. The differences between the interests of international and domestic audiences have also been documented by Lopez Pineiro and Hicks (2015), who point out that internationalisation-oriented science policies may negatively impact research agendas of Spanish sociologists. The present study suggests that for many Polish linguists, the emphasis on English as a publication language carries similar riss for the study of languages, comunication practice, and culture, with important community-specific research and context-tailored approaches likly to be dropped in favour of themes and frameworks that fare beter with international journals but bring less benefit to local communities.

Another important risk area identified in the study is disciplinary practices. Research participants pointed out that English as a language of science contributed to the demise of focused non-English language conferences and post-conference publications, raising concerns about sustainabilit and inclusivenes. In the studied context, focused supranational conferences in Slavic languages generate less cost for the participants and the environment than global events, often providing the first affordable opportunit for young scholars to share their research with the broader academic community and receive feedback. They also provide a venue for scholars from different parts of the world - including those where English is not commonly known - for whom the studied language isthe only one they share. Focused post-conference volumes, in turn, are affordable sources of information, in conrast to journal articles, which are often subscription-based and inaccessble because of a language barre. Switching to English as the main conference language deprives such academic communities of opportunities to build networks, and novice scholars in particular of opportunities for legitimate peripheral participation that could support them on the way to becoming expert members of their disciplines (Lave & Wenger, 1991).

Interestingly, participants in this study perceived the sttus of English as a threat to locally releant research or to Polish more often than respondents in Bolton and Kuteeva (2012), where lessthan half of Swedish humanities scholars saw English as a threat to a. ademic Swedish. The difference between Swedish and Polish results may be partly explained by English-language proficiency, as in the Polish context, this perception was associated with lower command of English. Another important factor that may underie the dif. feence isthe time the studies were done.  replication of Bolton and Kuteeva ten yearsafter the original rearch might i fact show a sense of threat that is closer to the figures reported here.

An important finding of this study concerns the sense of unfair advantage to L1 English scholars and the sense of being personally (dis)advantaged. Over $7 0 \%$ of survey respondents perceived the status of English as an international language of science as unfairly advantaging L1 English academics, as opposed to lower percentages reported from other contexts: about $4 0 \%$ among Romanian academics (Muresan & Perez-Llantada, 2014), nearly $5 0 \%$ in Spain (Ferguson et al., 2011), and over $5 0 \%$ in Sweden (Bolton & Kuteeva, 2012). In the present study, this opinion was significantly more frequently expressed by senior academics, scholars who published in three or more languages, reported lower English-language proficiency (an asociation also confirmed by Ferguson et al., 2011), and used Englis-language iterature to a limited extent. The perceived unfairnessof the situation may thus be intensified by the experienced challenge of publishing in English. The association between academic seniority and the perceived unfairnes may aso be symptomatic of emerging changes in academic practices, similar to those noticed by Sal0 (2017) in the field of history in the Swedish context. While more experienced scholars may continue to attach value to building academic rcognition and credibility at home or a regional transnational level, and to addressing broader audiences - to educate, popularise, and shape atitudes - novice researchers may choose to reorient towards international disciplinary community, seeing publishing in English as a chance to fast-forward their careers. This seniority-based difference in attitudes can lead to a major revision of isciplinary values and transformation of disci. plinary practices, with consequences for the utility of research to the society and for public engagement.

Contrasting with the rather widespread sense of an unfair advantage the status of English gives to L1 English scholars is the perception of the impact of English on individual academic careers. Less than one-fourth of the survey respondents saw themselves as disadvantaged by the emphasis on English in research publication, a discrepancy also noticed in previous studies: Bolton and Kuteeva (2012) report that only $1 0 \%$ of their humanities respondents perceived themselves as disadvantaged by the dominance of English, Ferguson et al. (2011) report $3 0 \%$ , and Muresan and Perez-Llantada (2014), $3 4 \%$ . In the present study, as in Ferguson et al. (2011), this result was not associated with academic seniority. The opinion that advantages outweigh disadvantages was associated with good command of English (in contrast to the findings of Muresan & Perez-Llantada, 2014) and a more extensive use of English-language literature, eflecting the respondents' abilit to benefit from the situation and the perceived need to contextualise their research in English-language research.

At the same time, it should be noted that almost $4 0 \%$ of Polish respondents remained neutral on the impact of English on their personal careers. This finding could perhaps be explained by data from the interviews. The participants did not perceive themselves as dominated by English, reporting mixed experiences and mixed perceptions of it rolei their academic lives. First, some interviewees experienced both advantages and disadvantages related to English as the dominant language of science: while they saw English as a form f capital, with a brodning effct n their reearch and outreach, using it to ther advantage cost them ot f time effort, and resources. Indeed, as shown by Amano et al. (2023) in a multi-context study of dssemination practices of environmental researchers, the cost of doing science bone by scholars who use English as an aditional language are significantly higher compared to those borne by their 1 English counterpart, a circumstance that may contribute to the perceived benefit and disadvantage associated with English for research publication. In such cases, then, the answer to this question is more nuanced. Second, the status of English was not always experienc as a factor affecting reondents rearch work In such cases, whilestil prceived as a potentil risk or beefit, it might have no personal relevance to the scholar. nteestingly, language barrer, while always an impedment, was not a factor that prevented the interviewees from benefiting from English, an observation that tllies with Schluer's (2014) findings on publication practices of German linguists. Along the same line, the interviews did not provide support for the perception of the prevalence of English as an unfair advantage to L1 English scholars. References to daunting experiences with reviews or resignation from English-language conferences were not combined with this reflection. Rather, attention was drawn to the detrimental impact of the evaluation sys. tem on some valuableacademic practices and costs it incurred for academics in terms of time, ffort, and money. Ths, the impression that emerges is one of unfair disadvantage to L2 English scholars that lies with unrealistic expectations of the system, not with English as a second or additional language.

These findings support the idea proposed by Hultgren (2019), who argues that existing inequalities in global academic publishing do not have to be based in language. Rather, the main factors underlying the disadvantage experienced by scholars who use English as an additional language seem to be economic in nature; as the author puts i, \*it may be more important that you find yourself in the right environment and that you have acess to the resources and networks you need, than whether or not you are a native speaker of English (p.9). In the present study, interview participants were clear about the fact that it was not language that was thesource of the perceived disadvantage. The problem lies with how language is used by systems which aim at increasing research productivit, international visibility, and contribution to global knowledge production. It is then research evaluation systems thatreinforce the inequalities and contribute to the perceived disadvantage, whose source i, as Hultgren observes, often simplistclly reduced to the anguage problem. Indeed, insufficient attention to economic, social, and political factors that accompany linguistic ones in creating and cementing inequity in academia is what Soler (2021) identifies as one of the main limitations of the debate over linguistic injustice in academic publishing.

Opinions on the need for one language in scholarly communication were polarised, with les than half positive responses. This moderate support stands in contrast to the findings from the Romanian $8 1 \%$ Muresan & Perez-Llantada, 2014) and Spanish contexts $( 8 3 \% )$ Ferguson et al., 2011). In the present study, positive responses were asociated with higher proficiency in English and more extensive use of English-language literature, showing that the ide of one language of science has more ppeal for scholars who can and do benefit from English as a lingua franca of scientific communication. Strongly multilingual scholars expressed agreement less frequently than the group dominated by bilingual academics. The interviews confirm the existing differences: apart from positive responses, there were also ambivalent reactions to the idea of one language of science, which, according to the participants, may be vital in some fields, but not in all especially context- or community-bound, areas of inquiry. A high awareness of the need for multilingual communication in science was particularly well demonstrated in the concern about the absence of institutional incentives for scholars to disseminate knowledge in other languages.

These reservations and concerns align with voices that support the idea of international languages rather than one global language of science. Siversten (2018) shows that in certain world regions, research and academic communication are carried out in severl international languages, depending on the participants, sttings, and purposes of the interaction. In a similar vein, the Nordic Councl of Ministers (2018) expresses doubts whether English should be the only or the main academic lingua franca in the Nordic Region. The interviews provide some evidence that similar doubts - raised in the context of the Central and Eastern European Region - may underlie the ambivalence of Polish linguist towards the idea of one global language of science.

In terms of the impact of English on the respondents' publication practices, the interviews have shown that recent decisions to publish in English were largely informed by evaluation policies. Thus, if publishing in English was a recent development, it was motivated primarily by ocal, institutional, evaluation-related considerations rather than by international cooperation, intended audience, or the research questions. By contrast, scholars who started publishing in English earlier reported different types of moti. vation: cooperation and co-authorship with a foreign scholar and targeting an international audience. At the same time, while they all experienced the impact of the policies, none of the interviewees felt a victim to the situation. Importantly, most of the respondents expressed awareness of the need to communicate research indifferent languages, depending on the subject matter and the target audience, and of the fact that the target audience was not always global. Neither interviewees who had published in English long before the interview nor those who had only recently started publishing in English expressed the intention to stop using their other publi. cation languages. They considered English as a means of reaching wider or different audiences or as a way to satisfy the demands of the system, keeping in mind the value of their other languages for the subject area and knowledge dissemination. Perhaps it is this awarenes - heightened by the time when the study was conducted and coinciding with discussions over Englishisation of higher education (Wilkinson & Gabriels, 2021), increased recognition of the need for greater involvement of local communities (European Commission, 2020) and calls for multilingual science (Helsinki Intiative on Multilingualism inScholarly Communication, 2019)-that underlies the observed differences in survey responses between this study and earlier surveys conducted in Spanish, Swedish, and Romanian contexts.

# 5. Limitations and closing remarks

The main limitations of the study include the moderate size of the survey sample recruited from 20 universities and a modest number of interviews limited to one institutional context. Although the seniority composition of the survey sample does not raise serious concerns, the fact that the respondents represented universities with a more competitie orientation should be bone in mind when intrrtig the rults ll intvie w rted from one unvrst o aid diffe relat  diffent intitutinal policies and working cultures, a solution which comes at the cost of limiting the perspective to one context.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the study provides some insight into the perceptions of the impact of English as an international language of cience on disciplinary practices and individual academic carers in one national context, with observations that may also apply to other countries of the Central and Eastern European Region and enable comparison with results obtained from other contexts. The choice of linguists as subject for this study was not accidental. Since representaties of this discipline are inherently predisposed to attach value to linguistic diversty and sensitive to ideological implications of language choice, they are likely to be alert to and aware of possible dangers posed by English as a language of publication. The results show that while they are well aware of the problems involved with the status of English as an international language f science and inequalities in global academic publishing, they do not see English as a lingua diabolica (Phillipson, 2009). Rather, they identify the source f the problems with policies that seal its status, afecting locally relevant research and disciplinary practice and contributing to the sense of disadvantage and unfarness associated primarily with manifold costs incurred by publishing in English.
