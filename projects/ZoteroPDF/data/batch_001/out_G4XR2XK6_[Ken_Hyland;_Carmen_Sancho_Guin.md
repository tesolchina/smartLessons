# 1 Introduction: a Context-Sensitive Approach to Stance and Voice

Carmen Sancho Guinda and Ken Hyland

Stance and voice are two of the most significant concepts in applied linguistics today, but at the same time, and perhaps because of this, they are also among the most contested and ambiguous. Stance, for example, has been shrunk to a focus on self-mention and expanded to include all expressions of personal opinion, whereas voice has been regarded as a key marker of individuality and as an ideological expression of Western cultural hegemony. Research has followed stylistic, critical and applied strands and definitions have changed over the past quarter-century, but the terms essentially refer to the expression of point of view in speech and writing and to the ways we engage with others. They are central to ways of looking at written texts as social interactions, where readers and writers negotiate meanings, and to how students can be taught to convey their personal attitudes and assessments and appropriately connect with their readers.

Evidence for the significance of these concepts is provided by the different treatments they have received in recent years. Basically, stance (Biber and Finegan, 1989; Biber, 2006; Jaffe, 2009) has been called ‘evaluation’ (Hunston and Thompson, 1999), ‘footing’ (Goffman, 1981), ‘intensity’ (Labov, 1984), ‘evidentiality’ (Chafe and Nichols, 1986), ‘affect’ (Ochs, 1989), ‘point of view’ (Simpson, 1993), ‘hedging’ (Hyland, 1998), ‘positioning’ (van Langenhove and Harré, 1999) and ‘appraisal’ (Martin, 2000; Martin and White, 2005). Voice, by contrast, gained momentum in the humanities as a social construct (Bakhtin, 1981; Kristeva, 1986) but is predominantly tied to the expressionist idea of authorial visibility and labelled as ‘personal stamp’ (Elbow, 1994), ‘signature’ (Martin and White, 2005) or ‘idiolect’ (Coulthard, 2008). As writers and teachers of writing, we felt that this was a good time to revisit these important concepts and to reassess what they mean in contemporary academic writing.

This book is therefore a collection of stances on stance-taking and the ways in which this may be voiced. It articulates a mosaic of individual scholarly perspectives that represent the current voice of academia within a specific field of discourse analysis and which explores a range of strategies and features expressing these concepts. Our own voices as editors fuse with those of our authors since we have recommended them to gloss and elaborate on contents, foreground ideas, delay, emphasize or bring forward arguments, add and refine headings, simplify syntax, and sometimes make their presence more visible and increase their involvement of the reader. We have also, to some extent, imposed our own lens onto their work by asking them to include a sample study to illustrate the points they are making and by choosing to structure the volume in a certain fashion. All these factors remind us of the multifaceted and polyphonic nature of stance and voice (epistemic and stylistic, personal and interpersonal), which may lead us to question their ownership and authenticity. This is particularly true in co-constructed texts like this book, where writers are attempting to persuade readers of their ideas while simultaneously trying to leave their stamp and align with other contributors and with a broader community of practice.

As editors, we have organized the book in four parts. It opens with two chapters by leading figures in this field who define stance and voice, weigh the impact of these concepts in academic writing and offer an update of the research. Parts II and III focus on the instantiation of stance and voice in particular academic contexts, looking first at professional genres (research articles, accompanying biographies, and textbooks) and then at those produced by students (doctoral and undergraduate theses, essays and commentaries on visual data). Together these parts depict the knowledge- and community-constructing functions of the university; the key genres through which knowledge is negotiated, transmitted, acquired and created. The final part contains studies which illustrate the factors which contribute to variation and change in stance and voice: channels, disciplines, cultures and time. Together these chapters provide us with a comprehensive and intriguing picture of stance and voice and their importance in contemporary academic writing.

# The centrality of context and community in the expression of stance and voice

The two interacting communities under study here, academics and university students, tend to use and respond to the features of stance and voice differently.

# Speaking about stance and voice

Learners’ reports suggest they are aware of the social component inherent to both concepts: Petric´’s 2010 interviews with master’s degree students on their perceptions of voice, which Tardy cites in the second chapter of this volume, show they join individual imprint and socially constrained writer choices identified with uniqueness, authority and opinion – and hence they view stance as an aspect of voice. The impressions of the Hong Kong undergraduates gathered by Hyland (Chapter 9) corroborate this vision and also reveal a confessed reluctance to represent themselves in the first person or to address readers directly by means of second person singular pronouns, directives and questions, out of sensitivity towards incurring face-threatening acts. However, this considerate inclination to self-effacement contrasts with their belief that overt stance through adverbials and the frequent boosting of propositions is a sign of genuine engagement with their work. Similarly, Sancho Guinda’s informants (Chapter 11) associate the voice of the academy with anonymous writing, noticing a register which differs from their everyday language use in its densely informative and highly nominalized style weighed down with interactive metadiscourse. They nonetheless think all these traits compatible with the conversational shifts and personal tone habitually employed by foreign language learning textbooks to foster fluency, making it difficult to align discursively with their teachers.

What these findings indicate is that, as Cameron contends in her epilogue to the book, first and foremost students need to ‘know the rules’, and not only to distinguish what is ungrammatical and unidiomatic but also to get rid of misconceptions and decide whether to respect norms and standards or diverge from them, being able to predict repercussions on the reader and thus writing their way to empowerment. Nonetheless, the equal access to ‘essayist literacy practices’ advocated by Hyland in his chapter will keep long out of our students’ reach unless both the expressivist and social (generic) notions of voice are consistently incorporated as assessment criteria in local and large-scale essay rubrics alike (Matsuda and Jeffery, Chapter 10). This measure requires explicit socio-constructivist instruction in the conventions of disciplinary communities, the use of exemplars, and the provision of expert repertoires.

Academics, on the other hand, envisage stance and voice from an array of linguistic frameworks and methodologies. The majority of contributors to this volume look at them from a more or less overt constructivist perspective and base their studies on corpora and in so doing draw on metadiscourse theory (Bondi, Hyland, Thompson), systemic functional linguistics (Hood, Tse), cognitivism (Silver), the classical rhetoric tradition (Gross and Chesley), reader-response (Tardy), diachronic research (Salager et al.) and qualitative discourse-based surveys (Hyland, Sancho Guinda and Silver). Their research foci equally give us a glimpse of how they conceive stance and voice in context and of the properties they highlight. While all authors state or imply that stance is subsumed in the broader phenomenon of voice, they understand the two features as a reversible flow of the communal into the personal, and link them to particular rhetorical situations.

In accord with the observations made at the beginning of this introduction, definitions of voice outnumber those of stance in these chapters and are generally equated with authorial presence and opinion on propositional information. This restriction may have something to do with the widespread application in corpus studies of Hyland’s (2005) model, its taxonomical simplicity seducing researchers to limit stance to self-mention, boosting, hedging and the adverbial marking of attitude. Underlying this taxonomy, however, as Hyland has shown, is a set of social norms – an ethical discursive code to be conformed with or transgressed in order to meet communal and individual purposes (Gross and Chesley, Chapter 6) and a set of rhetorical choices which reveals the writer’s conception of the addressed community through the inclusion or exclusion of specific genre moves (Bondi, Chapter 7; Thompson, Chapter 8; Sancho Guinda, Chapter 11; Silver, Chapter 13; Salager et al., Chapter 15). As Gray and Biber argue, stance is a continuum of evaluative meaning which varies along two axes: one epistemic and interpersonal (i.e. from feelings and attitudes to a status of knowledge) and the other linguistic (i.e. from lexis to grammar).

As for voice, the numerous conceptualizations of our authors fall into three main sorts, in no way mutually exclusive but interrelated: effect, role and empowering tool. Several chapters (Hyland’s, Matsuda’s, Sancho Guinda’s, Silver’s, Tardy’s and Thompson’s) stress the fact that voice is an impression which must be ultimately ascertained by the reader, and which depends on his/her decoding abilities. This is all the more so if it is transmitted through lexical stance (Gray and Biber, Chapter 2), as not everyone succeeds in grasping connotations and value-laden words.

Some authors (e.g. Bondi, Fløttum, Hewings, Hood, Silver and Thompson) see voice embodied in discipline-, genre- and discoursebound roles undertaken by the writer. For example, Hood (Chapter 4) speaks of ‘observers’, ‘critics’ and ‘participants’ in the research article introductions of a range of intellectual fields. Bondi compares the function and incidence of ‘recounters’, ‘interpreters’ and ‘academic arguers’ in English-medium textbooks on sociocultural subject matters and history journal articles. Thompson examines the projections of authority personae in the sections of PhD theses by using metadiscourse to smooth out the reading (e.g. through cross-referencing, previewing and reviewing) and stance devices to assert academic achievements. Hewings profiles the voices of young interactants in computer-mediated communication (CMC) as ‘thinkers’, ‘teachers/educators’ and ‘hybrid’. Silver differentiates between two writer personae (i.e. a conceptualizer and an anecdotal narrator, depending on the mode of discourse used – whether paradigmatic or narrative) in research articles dealing with microbiology, history of science and art history, and Fløttum traces the occurrence and weight of ‘researchers’, ‘writers’ and ‘arguers’ in a body of multidisciplinary research articles across the English, French and Norwegian cultures.

Like these sketched roles, lexico-grammatical, organizational and register choices also serve argumentation and become persuasive devices to empower the writer. Such options, as the chapters by Hood, Hyland, Sancho Guinda or Tse show, help to claim a membership status as knowledgeable individuals in the academic community through a discourse of authority and credibility. Hewings points on her part to the benefits offered by digital genres, which in conjunction with a careful sequencing of tasks and a modelling of the interaction, encourage critical, creative and cooperative voices among students: they dare to adopt voices different from their own to argue efficiently in an academic register. At other times, Gross and Chesley inform us in this volume, what is at stake is not identity and recognition but material profit, and to obtain it industrysponsored scientists deviate from the collective stance of their community (i.e. the Mertonian code of communalism, universalism, disinterestedness and organized scepticism) to exploit stance devices (principally boosting, hedging and attitudinal markers) to craft a voice that makes believe they are still embracing the communal values.

No less telling than definitions and objects of research, the tropes and collocations coined or borrowed by our authors mirror the type of stance and voice constructs they have in mind. In apparent contradiction, Hyland and Tardy respectively describe voice as ‘slippery’ and a ‘robust’ theoretical concept in academic discourse. Throughout the 15 chapters and this introduction, voice, like identity, is on the whole crafted, constructed, built, carved and created, almost always presented as a prolonged and effortful enterprise difficult to reconcile with the unconscious process of voice construction mentioned by Tardy.

Voice is found (supposedly after a conscious search, as Hewings seems to suggest), projected and expressed with varying degrees of authenticity. It may be adopted or taken on as a façade (Tse), a guise (Hyland), a mask (Sancho Guinda), or as the mantle of authority (Thompson), all of which might evoke transiency, insincerity and even usurpation. It often results from a social transaction as it is managed (Tse) and negotiated (Hood, Cameron). It is cumulative and cohesive as an amalgam or aggregate (Matsuda and Jeffery, Sancho Guinda) that espouses the writer’s thesis (Silver) and is in turn cemented by metadiscourse (Thompson). The original acoustic metaphor giving rise to the term does persist in the expressions audible writer voices (Salager et al.) or give the floor to other voices (Fløttum), and crosses sensory barriers in the synaesthesia visible voice (e.g. in Salager et al.’s chapter). All in all, the vocabulary of voice in this book situates this notion in the socio-constructivist centre of Matsuda’s epistemological continuum (see Tardy’s chapter), and only once is it contemplated from the expressivist pole, precisely to talk about expressivism: then voice emerges (Matsuda and Jeffery). Stance, in contrast, appears to ‘be there’ and is approached, marked, expressed and realized (Gray and Biber) or taken – mostly as a position (Bondi, Fløttum, Hyland, Sancho Guinda, Thompson, Tse), although it too may be developed (Tse), adopted (Gross and Chesley) and negotiated (Hood).

# Manipulating stance and voice

Our probing of stance and voice in written academic genres portrays two populations with different discursive needs and practices. Here again there are two operative levels of analysis: the stance and voice habits of professionals and students detected by the researchers in this volume, and their own stance and voice repertoires to expose them.

The academic prose of students is a reflection of the gap between secondary and post-secondary contexts signalled by Matsuda and Jeffery and caused by the dearth of adequate descriptions of specialized genres in higher education – learners bridging the gap through imitation and self-discovery. The student writing explored in this book responds to a motivation to align with assessors and persuade them of their competence and to share a sense of common identity with peer interlocutors in digital channels (e-forums, e-mail, blogs, etc.). Younger learners facing low-stakes and less constrained genres (Sancho Guinda’s graph commentaries and Hewings’ electronic interactions) mix registers, trying to maintain familiarity and an engaging tone while respecting status hierarchies and projecting intellectual autonomy. To these ends they mimic academic features indiscriminately, which may result in an excess of engagement (e.g. the ‘metadiscursive clutters’ in Sancho Guinda’s chapter) that can generate involuntary expressions of inauthentic stance and voice and create hybrid idiolects, such as the ‘hip hop dialects’ observed by Hewings.

By contrast, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the tension experienced by more mature report writers is no longer between registers but between authorial anonymity, assertiveness and sensitivity towards the reader. Hyland details how in their final-year dissertations Hong Kong students suppress any trace of their sociocultural identity and avoid the use of engagement features (direct pronominal appeals, directives and questions) out of reader considerateness, but over-boost their propositions in an attempt to put forward arguments convincingly. Thompson shows how the most experienced student writers, PhD candidates, exhibit greater autonomy in their decision to follow or disregard conventions (e.g. by embedding genres and discourses) and manipulate voice traits at three levels: global, sectional and propositional. Their voice and the successive stances towards their research and the object of study manifest themselves cumulatively through the whole document and in its rhetorical organization, in the transition devices and retrospective labelling through nouns inside and between chapters, and in the interplay between attribution and averral within propositions. Nevertheless, despite this keen awareness of resources, doctoral students tend to overuse hedging to sidestep criticism, a crucial strategy to establish academic identity.

Cautious criticism and the humble reporting of results are two of the major differences between expert and novice academic writing. Hedging is more abundant and sophisticated among professionals, who may subordinate it to individual goals that violate community norms (Gross and Chesley) instead of using it as a face-saving device. Apart from hedging, other expert stance and voice strategies are the adoption of roles, already commented on, the foregrounding of the knowledge or the knower (Fløttum, Hood, Silver, Thompson), and the rhetorical, thematic and lexico-grammatical options for self-representation (Tse). Role-taking enables the writer to take multiple positions: to sound like an arguer, interpreter, observer, etc., speak from the field or from the object of research, and downplay or underscore argumentation or exposition, depending on the genre. For instance, Bondi concludes that the role of arguer occurs less in history textbooks than in journal articles.

The writer may also choose to foreground the knowledge over the knower and vice versa by conceptualizing and categorizing entities and phenomena or by recounting episodes and anecdotes, thus employing either a paradigmatic or narrative mode of discourse. The paradigmatic mode allows writers to state the relevance of their research indirectly through empirical data – in what Silver terms de-subjectivization, logically expected in the hard sciences, which favour less authorial visibility and more knowledge foregrounding. The reverse tactic is to acknowledge other voices, either explicitly with reporting and citation (Hood, Silver, Thompson), or implicitly through linguistic markers (Fløttum). Finally, in this catalogue of professional stance and voice strategies, we should not forget preferences for self-representation. These encompass thematic, organizational and linguistic choices to communicate credible authority, and although this set of options may be thought to be highly personal, neither does it escape disciplinary influence. Like Hyland, Tse discovers field-dependent patterns in what academics say about themselves (e.g. educational background, publications, research interests, employment), in its sequencing and in its wording.

From a meta-perspective, it is interesting to see how our authors present these points in ways which draw on a range of distinctive engagement repertoires within the conventions of applied linguistics. At a move level, for example, we find frequent use of exemplification and interactive metadiscourse in all chapters. Some writers additionally help to guide readers by including partial summaries and conclusions between sections (e.g. Fløttum, Gray and Biber, Hewings, Hood, Thompson), while others foreground their objectives at the outset (e.g. Fløttum, Hyland, Sancho Guinda, Tse). Some authors directly address readers through the use of humour and anecdote (Cameron) or ad hoc metaphors (e.g. Sancho Guinda’s ‘no man’s land’ and ‘horror vacui’), while others pose rhetorical questions (Bondi, Fløttum, Salager et al., Tardy), reinforce understanding through glosses and lexical repetition (Gross and Chesley), or spell out procedures to decode a complex graph (Salager et al.). Linguistic idiosyncrasies in this volume are the verb contractions of Hyland and Tardy, Cameron’s mindfulness to shun sexism in pronominal references with her $\prime _ { \mathsf { S } } / \mathrm { h e } ^ { \prime }$ formula, Silver’s overt stancetaking (e.g. ‘I take the position of …’), typographic emphases from scare quotes to italics in foreign and key words (e.g. Cameron and Tardy) and even in examples to differentiate oral from written ones (Hyland).

The most prominent features, however, are self-mention and reader reference. Of our 11 single-authored chapters, 9 are written in the first person. In the remaining two (Bondi’s and Hood’s) authorial presence is replaced by an encoding into passives, inanimate subjects (e.g. ‘This chapter …’), nominalizations and occasional self-reference in the third person as ‘the author’ (Hood). With the exception of Hewings, Silver and Tse, all individual authors use an inclusive ‘we’ as guidance device through their texts. As we might anticipate, authorial (i.e. exclusive) ‘we’ is found in every co-authored chapter, but only two (Matsuda and Jeffery’s and Salager et al.’s) employ inclusive ‘we’ as well. The reader is addressed as such (i.e. ‘the reader’) in physical act directives by Hood and Tardy, and familiarly as ‘you’ in Gross and Chesley’s chapter and Cameron’s epilogue, though overlapping with generic reference rephraseable as ‘one’.

# Where to from here?

Perhaps the take-home message of this collective work should be the threefold characterization of stance and voice as diverse, distinctive and dynamic textual and interpersonal processes. Such diversity and dynamism are apparent in multilayered spheres of action. We see, for example, that:

they traverse national, academic and disciplinary environments (Fløttum; Hyland) to influence individual choices they work to evaluate epistemic, interpersonal and stylistic information (Gray and Biber) they can affect the whole text, its sections, or its propositions (Thompson) they may operate in a multiplicity of discursive roles (Bondi, Fløttum, Hewings, Hood, Silver and Thompson) they involve at least two modes of discourse, paradigmatic and narrative (Silver)   
they change substantially over time and across cultures, disciplines and channels (Fløttum, Hewings, Hyland, Salager et al. and Silver)   
they involve a circular relationship between them (Sancho Guinda)   
they can be tackled from a host of theoretical and methodological orientations.

To summarize, we can see that stance and voice are not mere textual features but cumulative processes that exert an effect on the reader, for whom they are brought into existence. Their importance lies in the role they play in negotiating meanings and agreement with interlocutors and the impression of a writer they make on those readers. The realization of stance and voice reveals a diversity and vibrancy shaped by conformity to community conventions and the expression of personal proclivities: they ‘read distinctive’ because choices represent individual preferences accountable to disciplinary practices.

Our aim in this book has not been to prescribe what communicative principles should be adhered to or discarded, nor to argue for the theoretical positions endorsed by our contributors, but to rechart the territory of stance and voice and inspire new context-sensitive pathways for exploration in academic settings. From here the scope for research is enormous. Among many other concerns, it comprises the study of emergent discourses (e.g. multimodal realizations in digital genres), the broadening and deepening of contrastive research, both intercultural and interdisciplinary, the expansion of diachronic investigation to more genres, the interaction between the voices of academy and industry, longitudinal studies on the acquisition of stance and voice features, or tests on the effect of various realizations on readers. The chapters that follow rethink categories and concepts and address theoretical ramifications useful when taking these roads.

# 1 Introduction

The linguistic mechanisms that convey a speaker or writer’s personal attitudes and assessments have long been of interest to linguists, and several major approaches to this function of language have been taken. In this chapter we survey several related threads of research, including evidentiality (e.g. Chafe, 1986), affect (e.g. Ochs and Schieffelin, 1989), hedging (e.g. Hyland, 1998b), evaluation (e.g. Thompson and Hunston, 2000), appraisal (e.g. Martin, 2000) and stance (e.g. Biber and Finegan, 1989). While each paradigm has its own focus and approach, this body of research as a whole contributes to our understanding of the ways in which speakers and writers encode opinions and assessments in the language they produce. In this chapter, we will refer to this overall concept as stance. Studies within these paradigms have been conducted with a variety of methodologies, ranging from detailed analyses of a single text to large-scale investigations of patterns across texts in a corpus, as well as from detailed analyses of a single linguistic item or feature to descriptions of a large set of lexical and grammatical features. Taken together, these studies show that the expression of stance varies along two major parameters:

(1) meaning of the assessment: personal feeling/ attitude status of knowledge (2) linguistic level used for the assessment: lexical grammatical

In Section 2, we explore Parameter 1 (the meaning of assessment) in further detail, considering both personal attitudes (attitudinal stance) and assessments of certainty and doubt (epistemic stance). In particular, we focus on the role that epistemic stance (the ‘status of knowledge’ end of the cline) plays in academic writing. In Section 3, we discuss the linguistic realizations of stance (Parameter 2), focusing on the issues of explicitness and implicitness in stance markers. Section 4 summarizes previous research on the role of stance devices in academic writing, commenting on comparisons to other spoken and written registers and considering previous findings and new directions for stance research in academic writing.

# 2 Conceptions of stance: from personal attitudes to the status of knowledge

Throughout the last three decades, research into the linguistic marking of stance has been approached under a range of terms, including intensity (Labov, 1984), posture (Grabe, 1984), disjuncts (Quirk et al., 1985), hedges (Brown and Levinson, 1987), modality (Palmer, 1986; Bybee and Fleischman, 1995) and (inter)subjectivity (White, 2003; Fitzmaurice, 2004; Lyons, 1993). Two lines of research, however, have been particularly foundational in today’s conceptions of stance: evidentiality (Chafe, 1986; Chafe and Nichols, 1986) and affect (Ochs and Schieffelin, 1989; Besnier, 1990).

In a broad sense, evidentiality refers to the status of the knowledge contained in propositions. In the first major research to consider evidentiality in English, Chafe (1986) outlines a multifaceted approach, discussing the linguistic indicators of four major components of ‘ attitudes towards knowledge’:

1. The degree of reliability of knowledge;   
2. The source of knowledge, such as evidence, the language of others, and hypotheses;   
3. The manner in which the knowledge was acquired (‘mode of knowing’), which includes personal beliefs, induction or inference from evidence, hearsay from what we have heard or learned from others, and deduction from hypotheses;   
4. The appropriateness of the verbal resources for marking evidential meaning, in terms of both the match between the linguistic markers and the actual status of the knowledge, as well as the match with reader/hearer expectations.

Around this same time, researchers were also beginning to investigate the linguistic realizations of affect: ‘feelings, moods, dispositions, and attitudes associated with persons and/or situations’ (Ochs and Schieffelin, 1989: 7). Ochs and Schieffelin identify two types of affect markers, those which indicate the intensity of an utterance and those which specify a particular attitude or emotion such as sorrow, surprise, anger, and so on. In contrast to evidentiality, affect markers express personal feelings, emotions and attitudes rather than evaluations of knowledge.

Biber and Finegan (1988, 1989) noticed that the same set of grammatical devices were used in English to realize the functions of evidentiality and affect, and thus they brought the two concepts together into a broader model of stance, encompassing personal attitudes and emotions as well as assessments of the status of knowledge. Stance functions have played a prominent role in the multidimensional analyses of register variation in every language studied to date (including English, Somali, Korean and Tuvaluan; see Biber, 1988; 1995: 249–52). As a result, Biber and Finegan (1988, 1989) undertook more detailed corpus-based investigations of stance features in a range of spoken and written registers, categorizing linguistic features according to a two-way distinction within affective and evidential meanings. Affect meanings could be either positive (e.g. fortunate, enjoy, happily) or negative (e.g. unnatural, embarrasses, sadly), and evidential meanings could indicate a level of certainty (e.g. impossible, demonstrate, without doubt, will ) or doubt (e.g. uncertain, assume, perhaps, maybe, might, should ).

In the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English (LGSWE, Biber et al., 1999), Biber and colleagues extended and developed this framework to include more specific meanings, maintaining a distinction between epistemic stance (evidentiality) and attitudinal stance (affect), and adding a third category to indicate ‘style of speaking’ (Biber, 2004, 2006a; Biber and Conrad, 2009). Epistemic stance includes meanings of certainty, doubt, actuality, precision or limitation, as well as indicators of the source or perspective of knowledge (e.g. according to, $X$ claimed that). Attitudinal stance includes attitudes, evaluations and personal feelings or emotions. Stance markers indicating ‘style of speaking’ offer the speaker/writer’s comments on the communication (e.g. honestly, in truth) (see Biber et al., 1999: Chapter 12 for further discussion).

Hyland’s extensive work in the area of stance is very much in line with earlier research. Hyland (1996, 1998a, 1998b, 1999, 2000) focused specifically on the importance of hedging and boosting in academic writing, with hedging referring to markers that limit commitment to a proposition (e.g. possible, might), and boosting referring to expressions indicating a high degree of certainty towards a proposition (e.g. certainly, obviously).

Building upon his earlier work in hedging and boosting, Hyland (2005) put forth an overall paradigm of stance specifically related to academic writing, which focused on ‘writer-oriented features of interaction and refers to the ways academics annotate their texts to comment on the possible accuracy or credibility of a claim, the extent they want to commit themselves to it, or the attitude they want to convey to an entity, a proposition, or the reader’ (emphasis in original, p. 178). Thus, Hyland’s stance framework encompasses evidentiality (identified in terms of hedging and boosting and corresponding to varying levels of commitment towards a proposition), affect or attitude markers, and presence (the degree to which a writer places him/herself in a text through the use of first person pronouns and possessive determiners).

Throughout discussions of stance, the term evaluation is often used in explaining the meanings of stance markers, as they offer the writer/ speaker’s evaluation of a proposition or entity. Thus, it is no surprise that a related body of research has been conducted under the umbrella term of evaluation. Hunston and colleagues (Hunston and Thompson, 2000; Hunston and Sinclair, 2000; Hunston, 1994) have been particularly influential here, and Thompson and Hunston (2000: 22–6) outline four parameters, or meanings, that evaluative language can convey:

1. Good–bad, or evaluations of positive and negative values or characteristics (value in Hunston, 1994);   
2. Certainty, relating to the degree of certainty the speaker/writer has with regard to information (status in Hunston, 1994);   
3. Expectedness, referring to how obvious or expected the information is to the hearer/reader;   
4. Importance or relevance (relevance in Hunston, 1994).

The final approach to stance that we introduce here is that of appraisal (Martin, 2000, 2003; Martin and White, 2005). Situated within systemic functional linguistics, appraisal theory builds upon the traditional concepts of affect and epistemic modality, and encompasses attitude, engagement and graduation. In this framework, attitudinal stance meanings are further categorized as indicating affect (emotional responses), judgement (moral evaluations) and appreciation (aesthetic evaluations). Martin and White (2005: 36) roughly align engagement, on the other hand, with epistemic stance meanings, and describe engagement as ‘concerned with the ways in which resources such as projective, modality, polarity, concession and various comment adverbials position the speaker/writer with respect to the value position being advanced and with respect to potential responses to that value position’. Graduation, then, deals with the gradability, or force and focus, of evaluations.

Despite a somewhat dizzying array of terminology, these five approaches to stance all reinforce a basic distinction between meanings that (a) indicate a speaker/writer’s personal attitudes, emotions and assessments, and (b) comment on the epistemic status of an entity or, more commonly, a proposition containing a piece of information. As shown below, the epistemic stance meanings are considerably more important in academic research writing than the attitudinal meanings.

# 3 Linguistic realizations of stance in English: from grammatical stance devices to value-laden words

As Hunston’s (2004) title ‘Counting the uncountable’ illustrates, identifying the linguistic realizations of stance in a text is not always an easy task. Early research in the areas of evidentiality (and affect) often focused on languages other than English, in which obligatory affixes or particles are used to identify the source and/or certainty of information. In contrast, English has no obligatory grammatical elements to express stance meanings. However, there are numerous optional linguistic features used in English for this purpose, including both grammatical devices and simple word choice. In addition, stance-related meanings can be expressed in speech through tone of voice, duration, loudness and other paralinguistic features.

Most previous studies of stance in English have focused on grammatical stance devices: complement clause constructions, stance adverbials, modal verbs and stance noun $^ +$ prepositional phrase constructions (see Biber et al., 1999: 966–86). These devices overtly express an attitude or assessment with respect to some proposition. That is, a grammatical stance device has two distinct components, one with the dedicated function of expressing a personal stance, and the second presenting a proposition that is framed by that stance.

Complement clause constructions (especially that-clauses) are probably the clearest case of a grammatical stance device: the controlling element (a verb, adjective or noun) expresses the stance relative to the proposition in the complement clause. For example:

I’m very happy that we’re going to Sarah’s.

I’m sure that you’ve seen this too.

The fact that actual profits are variable adds to the instability of investment.

Stance adverbials also clearly express an overt attitude or assessment with respect to the proposition contained in the matrix clause:

Obviously, it is not practical for accountants to measure business income in this manner.

Unfortunately, it is presently impossible to predict which effect will emerge in a particular situation.

In fact, this process of creation almost never just happens magically and effortlessly but instead involves much trial and error.

Modal (and semi-modal) verbs are commonly used to express stance meanings, but they are less explicitly a grammatical marker of stance, because the modal verb is incorporated into the matrix clause. For example:

Moreover, the story might reflect Chopin’s own views of her marriage, despite her conscious statements about her loving husband.

She has to rent an apartment someplace downtown, right?

Finally, stance noun $^ +$ prepositional phrase constructions have two distinct grammatical components, but it is not always clear that the prepositional phrase actually expresses a ‘proposition’:

Government regulation is a fact of business existence.   
… and a free-market economy and trade with democracies like the US and Japan is our only hope for security and prosperity.   
The life expectancy test shows the importance of heredity, lifestyle, social forces, and other social characteristics such as marital status.

At the other extreme of this parameter, stance can also be expressed through simple word choice, as in the use of evaluative main verbs and adjectives:

I love that one, that’s darling.

Donald is an intelligent, likable, and hard-working college graduate.

Affective or evaluative word choice differs from grammatical stance marking in that it involves only a single proposition, rather than expressing a stance relative to some other proposition. With such value-laden words, the existence of a stance is inferred from the use of an evaluative lexical item, usually an adjective, main verb or noun.

Many of the most common words in English are evaluative and used for lexical expressions of stance (see Biber et al., 1999: 968–9). For example, the most common adjectives in conversation include good, bad, lovely and nice, used in both predicative and attributive functions:

oh that’s bad.   
you climb the mountain because it’s a nice hike.   
A good place to start is the text.

Similarly, the most common verbs in conversation include like, love, need and want, which express an emotion or attitude towards whatever is referred to by the direct object:

Number three, we love stuff.

Such lexical expressions of stance are not restricted to conversation. For example, several of the most common attributive adjectives in academic prose are evaluative, including appropriate, good/best, important, practical, useful (see Biber et al., 1999: 511–15):

Scott states that the severity of a sanction leveled by others on an individual who has violated a norm represents one of the best indications of the norm’s relative.

This group occupies important economic positions and some of its members have even been elected as foremen of their economic branch.

As the above examples illustrate, lexical expressions of stance depend on the context and shared background for appropriate interpretation as speaker/writer attitudes and evaluations. That is, there is nothing in the grammatical structure of these expressions to show that they mark stance: they are simple declarative structures that give the appearance of presenting stanceless ‘facts’. Thus, most attributive adjectives are descriptive or classificatory, but not evaluative. Thus, compare the adjectives in the following sentence to those illustrated above:

The amount of information concerning the ultrastructural correlates of skeletal muscle denervation atrophy has grown considerably in recent years, but only a slow progress has been made toward a substantial understanding of the problem.

In sum, the simple use of value-laden words provides no overt grammatical devices to signal the presence of stance. Stance is embedded in these structures, depending on the addressee’s ability to recognize the use of value-laden words.

However, there is also variation among grammatical stance devices in the extent to which they explicitly attribute a stance directly to the speaker/writer (see Biber et al., 1999: 976–8). The most overt expressions of stance are those with first person subjects, as in:

We know that people often play up their successes and play down their failures.

And so we are not surprised also to find numbers of small bronzes and images of gilt bronze, silver, and gold from the region.

Expressions which attribute stance evaluations to the addressee or a third person are less explicit, as the stance markers do not necessarily reflect the speaker/writer’s own evaluations; these structures are often excluded from analyses of speaker/writer stance:

While many smaller European settler farmers worried that regionalism might undermine their claims to land rights …

You may mentally retrace the day’s events in an attempt to remember what you were doing when you last had the car keys, because you know that this most recent event is the most causally relevant to the current location of the keys.

Other lexico-grammatical structures do not overtly attribute the stance meaning to the speaker/writer; these devices include modal and semimodal verbs, stance adverbials and extraposed complement clauses:

Attitudes may be useful in diagnosing why consumers buy your Product, or why they don’t.

Clearly, the problem is not insurmountable, and simulation is being used in business with increasing frequency.

It is possible that the data were too noisy to detect an underlying trend.

Complement clauses controlled by communication verbs can also be considered as a type of implicit stance marking, where the choice of communication verb indicates the author’s stance towards the information:

The authors suggest that Native American perspectives can provide elements for a contemporary ecological model of living …

Some theorists go so far as to assert that schizophrenia is largely the creation of society …

Most corpus-based studies of stance apply a lexico-grammatical methodological approach, analysing the sets of lexical items in specific grammatical structures that express particular stance meanings (certain $^ +$ that-clause expressing epistemic stance, versus interesting $^ +$ that-clause expressing attitudinal stance). Stance features of this type can be reliably identified and quantified through the use of automatic tools. The frameworks presented in Biber (2006a, b; Biber and Finegan, 1989; Biber et al., 1999), Hyland (1996, 1998a, 1998b, 1999, 2000) and Hunston and Sinclair (2000) generally take this approach, and analyse a variety of structural types of stance markers. Each stance marker is also typically categorized along the cline of epistemic (expressing certainty, doubt/likelihood, and style of speaking) and attitudinal meanings.

Other research focuses more specifically on a single lexical item (e.g. Diani, 2008 on really), a lexical class (e.g. Swales and Burke, 2003 on evaluative adjectives), or a particular grammatical structure (e.g. Biber and Finegan, 1988 on stance adverbials; Baratta, 2009 on passives; Charles, 2006, 2007 and Hyland and Tse, 2005 on stance constructions with that-clauses). A final, complementary approach involves a close reading of a text to inductively identify instances of evaluative language (e.g. Hunston 1993, 1994; Tucker, 2003). This type of research is more often carried out within the evaluation and appraisal frameworks (e.g. White, 2003; Dressen, 2003), and can include discussion of both grammatical and lexical stance expressions.

# 4 The expression of stance in academic writing

Academic research writing has traditionally been perceived to be objective, focused on conveying factual information. As Mauranen and Bondi (2003a: 269) put it: ‘Academic discourses carry the special weight of older traditions and ideals of scientific objectivity, which supposedly were to be reflected in academic writing as neutral, detachedly descriptive stances, as far removed from the human touch as possible.’

In reaction to this traditional characterization, discourse analysts over the last two decades have given considerable attention to the use of evaluative language in academic discourse. Several researchers (e.g. Hunston, 1993, 1994; Hyland, 2005; Charles, 2006) argue that academic discourse seeks to persuade the reader to accept the author’s viewpoint or research findings, and thus should not be regarded as ‘objective, faceless and impersonal’ (Hyland, 2005: 173). Hunston (1994: 192) goes so far as to claim that persuasion is the primary goal of experimental research reports, and thus the author’s primary purpose is ‘to persuade the academic community to accept the new knowledge claims … and to adjust its network of consensual knowledge in order to accommodate those claims’. Building on these new perspectives, numerous studies have investigated the expression of stance and evaluation in written academic discourse (e.g. Baratta, 2009; Charles, 2006, 2007; Dressen, 2003; Hunston, 1993, 1994; Hyland, 1996, 1998a, b, 1999, 2000; Hyland and Tse, 2005; Mauranen and Bondi, 2003b; Silver, 2003; Swales and Burke, 2003; Tucker, 2003).

However, comparative register research shows that the old stereotypes about the stanceless nature of academic writing are to some extent accurate. The studies surveyed in the last paragraph argue for the importance of stance in academic writing by restricting the scope of investigation to this single register. In contrast, studies that take a multi-register perspective have shown repeatedly that overt stance expressions are relatively rare in academic writing when compared to other spoken and written registers. Thus, for example, 75 per cent of the written academic texts analysed in Biber and Finegan (1989) were statistically categorized as ‘faceless’ (using a cluster analysis, based on the distribution of 12 lexico-grammatical stance devices). In contrast, most personal letters were grouped in the ‘emphatic expression of affect’ cluster, and most public speeches were grouped in the ‘oral controversial persuasion’ stance category.

As noted above, multidimensional studies of register variation have consistently identified one or more linguistic dimensions of variation that are associated with stance functions. However, those dimensions show that stance is especially prevalent in spoken registers and overtly interpersonal or persuasive written registers; in contrast, lexico- grammatical stance devices are comparatively rare in informational written registers like academic prose or official documents. These patterns have been replicated in studies of general spoken and written English registers (Biber, 1988) and university spoken and written registers (Biber, 2006b: 177–212), as well as spoken and written registers in other languages like Somali, Korean and Spanish (Biber, 1995: 249–52; Biber et al., 2006).

Detailed corpus-based studies of lexico-grammatical stance features also show these same patterns. For example, the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 12) to the description of grammatical stance devices in four major registers. Overall, stance expressions are much more common in conversation than in writing, and they are more common in newspaper reportage than in academic writing. This pattern holds for stance adverbials, complement clause constructions and modal verbs.

There is thus need for a balanced approach to the characterization of stance in academic writing. On the one hand, by focusing exclusively on this register, numerous studies have argued for the importance of stance expressions in academic prose. On the other hand, by taking a comparative register approach, other studies have shown that stance is much more commonly expressed in other spoken and interpersonal written registers, and that it is comparatively rare in academic writing.

There are, however, a few specialized grammatical stance devices that are used especially in academic writing, including extraposed complement clauses, stance noun $^ +$ that-clause constructions, and stance noun+prepositional phrase constructions. Biber (2006b: Chapter 5) documents patterns in stance use across university spoken and written registers in a large corpus (c.3 million words), showing that stance features are generally rare in textbooks and research articles when compared to their density of use in spoken university registers as well as other written registers like course syllabi and university catalogues.

More specifically, Biber (2006b: Chapter 5) demonstrated that with respect to three major classes of stance features (modal and semi-modal verbs, stance adverbs, and that- and to-complement clauses controlled by stance verbs, nouns and adjectives), written academic registers (textbooks, course management texts and course packs) express stance to a lesser degree than spoken academic registers across all three types of stance markers (with the exception of modal verbs in course management texts). In all registers, modal verbs are the most frequent, followed by stance complement clauses and then by stance adverbs.

Other findings from Biber (2006b: Chapter 5) include the following:

1. Textbooks and research articles are most reliant on possibility/ permission/ability modals in comparison to other types of modals, typically with inanimate and/or abstract subjects:

This approach may also be unsatisfactory for two main reasons. Conceptual teaching can result in enhanced problem-solving abilities among learners.

2. Within the possible stance meanings, both spoken and written registers use adverbs indicating a high degree of epistemic certainty (e.g. actually, certainly, in fact) to a greater extent than other stance adverbs. While likelihood adverbs (showing a lesser degree of certainty and/or some amount of doubt, e.g. apparently, perhaps, possibly) are much more frequent than either style or attitudinal adverbs in the three spoken registers, the written registers use likelihood and style adverbs to similar extents and rely on these style adverbs to qualify the source or extent of knowledge:

According to the resource-sharing model, temporary storage capacity is contingent upon processing efficiency.

The smaller or reversed gender difference in longevity in the developing nations is due primarily to maternal mortality …

3. Written academic registers employ that- and to-complement clauses headed by stance nouns, whereas these structures are largely absent from spoken academic registers:

We cannot rule out the possibility that the more carnivorous taxa (P. bipunctata, D. cephalotes, Polycentropodidae) do assimilate a small amount of the algal material consumed.   
Thirty-six-month-olds then successfully mapped the novel adjective to the shared property, as evidenced by their significant tendency to select property-matched over kind-matched test objects.

4. That-complement clauses headed by words conveying a degree of certainty are generally the most common in all registers (with the exception of study groups). The examples below illustrate common stance words in these constructions in research articles and textbooks, where writers assert the truth of the proposition that follows:

It is known that adolescents of this age rapidly move from one mood state to another and display strong emotions for each mood swing. We have shown that replication timing before X inactivation does not correlate with skewing of X inactivation.   
It is clear that the performance difference grows with the number of processors used.

5. While spoken registers rely on clauses with likelihood meanings more than communication meanings, the informational written registers (textbooks, research articles) rely on likelihood and communication meanings fairly equally. Complement clauses carrying a meaning of likelihood reflect a lesser degree of commitment or certainty:

Thus, we hypothesized that a high K ratio elicits more cooperation than a low K ratio (Experiment 1).

while complement clauses headed by communication verbs and nouns indicate the manner in which a piece of information has been communicated, as in:

Nevertheless, we propose that the most important spatial scales of variation in kelp holdfast assemblages on temperate reefs in north-eastern New Zealand depend on which aspect of the assemblage is of interest. This is not to imply that simply because a selection practice has disparate impact it is necessarily illegal.

6. The examples of stance complement clauses in this section also illustrate a distinctive stance marker in academic writing: extraposed complement clauses (e.g. from the examples above: it is known that, it appears that, it is clear that, it was obvious that, it is possible that). Previous research has shown that these structures are more common in academic writing than in other registers (Biber et al., 1999: 674).

One question that has not to date been studied from an empirical corpus-based perspective is the extent to which stance is expressed lexically (through evaluative word choices) in academic writing. In another research study (Biber and Gray, 2010), we track major historical changes in the grammatical style of academic research writing over the past two centuries, and argue that these changes have at the same time resulted in an increasingly LESS explicit expression of meaning relations. Against that backdrop, it is reasonable to hypothesize that stance in academic writing would often be expressed implicitly rather than employing explicit grammatical devices. Hunston (1993: 70) also raises this possibility, noting that the fact that ‘research articles are essentially persuasive in function and yet attract the label “objective” is an indication of the indirectness of evaluation involved’.

For example, we can investigate the possibility of stance based on lexical items alone by considering all instances of the stance words included in the stance paradigm used in Biber et al. (1999) and Biber (2006a, b).

Whereas many existing corpus-based analyses only count these words as stance markers when they occur in particular grammatical contexts (as described in Section 3), the brief analysis here also considers them when they occur outside of those specific grammatical frames.

The following passage comes from the discussion section of a research article in education (McQuillan, 2005). Lexico-grammatical markers of stance (which would have been identified in the corpus-based approach taken in Biber, 2006a, b) are underlined. Any word (or related word form) from the list of stance-conveying words is in bold if it occurs outside of the grammatical context. Words which might be considered to convey stance but which are not included in the stance framework presented above are italicized.

Such trends highlight the need for ongoing, collaborative reflection so that people understand one another’s perspectives and have opportunities to balance each other’s power if necessary, the early chaos at Frontier being a perfect example. Finally, given its synergistic potential, student empowerment seems a promising strategy for addressing the achievement gap. In too many US schools, educational opportunity has been undermined by a constellation of factors that are so interwoven that decades of reform have been unable to address them. In my view, the most promising strategy for reversing such long-standing failings of our educational system would be to make student empowerment – in all of its dimensions – our top educational priority. At the least, making students genuine participants in a more democratic educational process seems an appropriate and estimable goal for one of the world’s oldest democracies. [RA]

Instances of explicit lexico-grammatical stance markers occur throughout the passage: opportunities to balance …, have been unable to address them, would be … . In addition, two examples from this passage, the need for and failings of, illustrate a pattern that has been found to be an important stance marker prevalent in academic writing: stance noun $^ +$ prepositional phrases.

However, some of these individual words, we would argue, also clearly indicate the writer’s evaluation of something. For example, the use of attribute adjectives like promising and appropriate indicate evaluations, perhaps in part because of their use after the verb seem. In these cases, the attributive adjectives modify a noun that encapsulates the subject of the sentence (a promising strategy refers to student empowerment, and an appropriate goal refers to the proposition making students genuine participants …), and the attributive adjectives offer evaluations of those entities. Although the stance is grammatically implicit here, it can safely be assumed that the writer is the one making these evaluations.

Other words that are a part of the stance framework discussed above but which occur outside of lexico-grammatical frames are not as clearcut. That is, any stance they convey is even more implicit than the examples discussed in the previous paragraph. For example, while the nouns opportunity and failings convey positive and negative connotations (and humans generally consider failings to be a bad thing), it is less clear as to whether or not these words convey the writer’s stance. Thus, the stance here is much more implicit and dependent on the reader’s interpretation of the writer’s word choice.

Still other words and phrases appear to indicate the writer’s stance, but are not included on the list of stance words in the framework presented above. For example, describing an example as perfect seems similar to declaring something good or bad, adjectives which are on the stance list. Phrases such as in my view and at the least also indicate the writer’s stance. In these two examples, the stance is fairly explicit, positioned as sentence adverbials that comment on the proposition contained in the sentence.

This brief analysis illustrates that in addition to a lexico-grammatical approach to stance in academic writing, it is possible for evaluative lexis to convey a writer/speaker’s personal stance, yet this stance is generally more implicitly attributed to the author.

# 5 Concluding remarks

While previous research has established that stance markers are used to a higher extent in spoken registers when compared to written registers, this research has also illustrated the prevalence of epistemic stance meanings in all academic registers, regardless of mode. For example, the results summarized from Biber (2006b) above show that stance markers indicating the degree of commitment a writer has toward a proposition or entity are most prevalent in nearly all cases. Although the exact results have not been included here due to space constraints, Biber (2006b) found that attitudinal markers are not used commonly in any of the written academic registers, and are particularly not attested in the written informational registers of textbooks and research articles. Rather, the written informational registers rely most on markers indicating a high degree of commitment (certainty), followed by likelihood and communication stance markers.

However, the study also illustrates that written registers also exhibit unique patterns of stance marking. Of the findings summarized for written registers, written academic registers have also attested the use of complement clauses headed by stance nouns as explicit markers of stance, while these structures are largely absent from all spoken academic registers.

Furthermore, it should be clear, from the brief analysis of evaluative lexis, that more implicitly marked stance is also worthy of study in academic writing, and future research would benefit greatly from the development of analytical approaches that would allow for the large-scale analysis of evaluative lexis in addition to the more explicitly marked lexico-grammatical stance. While it is feasible to analyse previously established stance words in environments other than the lexicogrammatical patterns identified in this case study through large-scale, automated processes (with the assumption that these words do indeed carry stance meanings in these other contexts), it would be much more difficult to identify additional words and phrases with a high degree of reliability. That is, while we can confidently identify stance words that occur in contexts (such as complement clauses) where the stance expressed is grammatically related to a proposition, it is more difficult to identify stance words that are not as overtly expressed grammatically. Thus, approaches which allow for the reliable analysis of evaluative lexis in large corpora need to be developed and evaluated in future research.

Finally, it should be noted that the analysis presented in this chapter has focused on broad patterns in the types and general meanings expressed by stance markers in several academic registers, rather than detailed analyses and interpretations of meanings and textual functions. This, along with comments on disciplinary differences in the use of stance markers, we leave for the chapters that follow.

# 3 Current Conceptions of Voice

Christine M. Tardy DePaul University, Chicago

Providing an overview to the concept of voice is no simple feat. It is a term most writers have heard or used, perhaps even in their early days of writing, and that many have strong feelings about, whether positive or negative. I myself avoided its use for many years, leery of its imprecise meaning and its often literary and aesthetic overtones. Indeed, one of the thorniest issues with the notion of voice is the broad range of meanings ascribed to it. Metaphorical interpretations are multiple and subject to arguments about how far the metaphor can accurately be extended. It is perhaps this polysemous nature of voice that has made it a somewhat controversial concept in academic writing, and surely this definitional ambiguity has as well contributed to scholarly disputes over the role it should play in the academic writing classroom (e.g. Elbow, 1999; Ramanathan and Atkinson, 1999; Stapleton, 2002; Helms-Park and Stapleton, 2003; Matsuda and Tardy, 2007; Stapleton and HelmsPark, 2008).

# 1 Dimensions of voice

Attempting to disentangle the many interpretations of voice, I first outline three broad dimensions: individual aspects, social aspects, and voice as dialogic. Classifying voice definitions into these general categories is not novel. Prior (2001), for example, identifies two poles in the debate on voice – personal and social – and then develops a dialogic, sociohistoric theory of the concept, which he argues ‘offer[s] resources for getting beyond the binary of the personal and the social, for taking a complex view of agency as distributed across persons, practices, artifacts, and cultural activity systems’ (p. 79). In researching student conceptions of voice, Petric´ (2010) identifies three relatively distinct views as well – in this case, individualized voice, voice as a result of the writer’s choices, and voice as a result of the writer’s interactions with others. Matsuda (2011) has identified definitions of voice as falling on an epistemological continuum, including personal perspectives on one extreme end, social constructivist perspectives in the middle (i.e. those that recognize how individuals learn and negotiate social conventions), and social constructionist perspectives at the other extreme end (i.e. those that privilege social conventions). While the relationship among these three broad orientations to voice is up for debate, most would agree that voice encompasses both individual and social dimensions, though certain dimensions may be foregrounded at different times. By looking now more closely at these three dimensions of voice, I hope to familiarize readers with some of the common uses of the term and the ways in which it may be employed and interpreted by scholars, teachers, and students of academic writing. I have deliberately avoided positioning individual scholars within particular categories, as it seems to me that most of those who have written on voice occasionally acknowledge all of these dimensions in their work, though perhaps to varying extents.

# 1.1 Individual aspects of voice

When viewed as primarily the property of an individual, the metaphor of voice is seen as unique and personal in nature, or ‘that which individuates a writer from all other writers, as evidenced in that writer’s texts’ (Ramanathan and Atkinson, 1999: 49). Definitions that emphasize individual voice often establish close connections between metaphorical (written) voice and literal human voice. Elbow (1994) draws out some of the distinctive features of literal voice, such as that human voices are recognizable and unique, and that they include both a sound and also a manner or style. As humans, Elbow notes, we modulate our voices in different contexts, for different purposes, and when speaking with different people. Our spoken voice may reveal our feelings about a topic or at a particular point in time, or we may take on a different voice to express a different character, as an actor may do. Much like literal voice, Elbow (1994) argues, writers may develop a written voice that is unique and stylistically recognizable. This close relationship between voice and style is also acknowledged in Elbow (2007), where it is noted that ‘Many of the textual features that people describe in terms of voice can also be described as matters of style’ (p. 177).

The notion of uniqueness, or voice as a kind of individual imprint on a text, has persisted both in the literature and in writing textbooks and classrooms, despite critique (e.g. Hashimoto, 1987; Bowden, 1995). Exemplifying the use of voice as an individual stamp, Steward (1972, cited in Bowden, 1995) writes in a student writing textbook, ‘Your authentic voice is that authorial voice which sets you apart from every living human being despite the common or shared experiences you have with many others’ (p. 175). This equation of voice with authenticity is also relatively common. Elbow (2007) identifies two kinds of voice that are linked to the writer as an individual: sincerity and resonance. Sincerity, here, is described as ‘one style or voice … useful for some occasions,’ while resonance is described as ‘places where the writer has gotten a bit more of his or her self in or behind or underneath the words – often a bit of the unconscious self’ (p. 179). It should be emphasized, however, that Elbow (1994) sees resonance as just one kind of voice and also states that one’s written voice, no matter how recognizable or unique, ‘is not about “real identity”’ (p. xxxi).

Understanding voice primarily through this individual dimension seems to be especially common among writing teachers and students. An interview study by Jeffery (2010) examines secondary school writing teachers’ definitions of voice. She found that most of her 20 participants defined voice from an expressivist perspective, with the majority of definitions highlighting voice as the author’s presence, authenticity, or resonance. One teacher, for example, described voice as ‘the author’s soul … it’s the author on paper … It’s you in your writing’ (p. 101). When further queried as to what features they associated with voice, the teachers ultimately identified six main categories of language features: literary (e.g. figurative language, imagery), rhetorical (e.g. anecdote, rhetorical questions), evaluative (e.g. emotional language, point of view, reflection, stance, and tone), adolescent (e.g. cliché and hyperbole), stylistic (e.g. adjectives, diction, sentence length), and global (e.g. clarity, repetition, complexity). For these teachers, such features were not tied to genre but rather seen as more general.

While Jeffery’s (2010) study gives some insight into how teachers may understand voice, Petric´’s (2010) research demonstrates some common student perceptions. Interviewing 30 master’s degree students about their understanding of voice in relation to their dissertation writing, Petric´ (2010) found that most of their definitions fell under the category of ‘personal voice.’ Many students equated voice with ownership, authority, or opinion, as illustrated by this student’s comments:

In the third chapter, I used so much my own interpretative voice, and I was actually really surprised at how bold I was. But I figured it’s my dissertation, so I might as well say what I really think … it was almost my own voice the whole time, and it felt risky. (p. 329)

Another student noted that her supervisor took note of her voice getting ‘lost’ in her master’s dissertation, saying, ‘It looks from your writing like you are really trying to hide yourself so that you wouldn’t have to be committed to any of the positions’ (p. 330). The relationship between commitment and voice referred to here is in fact another commonly described aspect of individual voice – one that is not unrelated to stance. Hyland (2008) views stance as conveying ‘different kinds of personal feelings and assessments’ (p. 9). In his model, stance includes evidentiality (commitment to the evidence), affect (attitude toward the content), and presence (self-projection of the writer into the text). Presence in particular is marked by features often associated with individual aspects of voice: hedges, boosters, attitude markers, and self-mention. There are some close connections between this notion of stance and Ivanicˇ’s (1998) concept of self as author, defined as ‘the writer’s position, opinions and beliefs … how they claim authority as the source of the content of the text ... [and] how far they establish an authorial presence in their writing’ (p. 26). While these particular researchers take a firmly social view of voice (as described in the next section), their descriptions also lay front and center the commitments and positions that an individual brings to and expresses through a text.

In sum, then, individualized voice is often described as a writer’s unique and recognizable imprint, associated with authenticity, resonance, authoritativeness, and authorial presence within a text. It may relate to notions of style and stance and is often considered to be carried out through particular linguistic features. More generally, individual aspects of voice contribute to a broader conception of a writer’s self-representation within a text (e.g. Ivanicˇ and Camps, 2001). Yet, as scholarship on voice (and identity more broadly) also demonstrates, self-representation is constructed both individually and socially – bringing us to the social dimensions.

# 1.2 Social aspects of voices

Whereas ‘individual voice’ may be thought of as the property of the writer, ‘social voice’ is associated more with the disciplinary or other social groups to which the writing and writer are linked. These socially grounded conceptions argue that the voice of a text is created within a social context; the social voices of that context are part of the writer’s repertoire from which he or she may draw when selecting words, phrases, grammatical structures, organization patterns, even visuals to incorporate within a text.

Two of Ivanicˇ’s (1998) aspects of writer identity – discoursal self and possibilities for selfhood – emphasize the social and multiple nature of identity and are related to the social dimensions of voice. Ivanicˇ describes discoursal self as ‘the impression – often multiple, sometimes contradictory – which [writers] consciously or unconsciously convey of themselves in a particular written text’ (p. 25). This aspect of identity is social in nature, ‘constructed through the discourse characteristics of a text, which relate to values, beliefs and power relations in the social context in which they were written’ (p. 25). That is, when a writer chooses to employ traditional features of a scientific research article genre, for example, he or she takes on the discoursal identity of a scientist, perhaps even a traditional scientist, depending on how closely traditional values and norms are adhered to. While discoursal self, in Ivanicˇ’s framework, is meant to refer to individual writers, her notion of possibilities for selfhood deals with ‘prototypical possibilities … which are available to writers in the social context of writing’ (p. 27). Writers construct a discoursal self out of possibilities for selfhood that are available within the social context and genres they are working within.

The importance of social context in constructing voice is similarly accentuated in discussions of how writers position themselves in relation to the texts they draw upon. As writers choose certain discourses (and not others) and align their work with particular texts and authors, they construct voice (Ivanicˇ, 1998; Hyland, 2002, 2008). In this sense, voice is again related to the concepts of stance and engagement, which may be thought of as strategies for expressing voice through ‘the ways [writers] deploy community-sensitive linguistic resources to represent themselves, their positions and their readers’ (Hyland, 2008: 20). The choices writers make in self-representation (or voice), in other words, are socially conditioned, or at least influenced by social context. Research has shown, for example, that writers within a discourse community often opt for similar forms of self-representation. In a corpusbased discourse analysis, for example, Hyland (2002) found distinctions in the ways in which undergraduate L2 writers and published academic authors made use of author pronouns and determiners (I, me, my, we, us, our); differences were also identified across disciplines for published authors. Gea-Valor (2010) explored author presence, or voice, through linguistic features such as first-person pronouns and possessives, parenthetical forms, and attitudinal and opinion markers in academic and nonacademic book reviews and found both distinctions and similarities across contexts. These studies, among others, suggest that an author’s apparent voice in a text, resulting from linguistic choices, is not independent of social aspects of writing, such as genre and audience, but is tied to those aspects in crucial ways.

Social aspects of voice also make note of the multiplicity of voice within a text, as writers resort to and blend many voices in deliberative or unconscious ways as they write. The notion of heteroglossia is therefore central to understanding social aspects of voice. In theorizing this concept, Bakhtin (1981) emphasized the multi-voicedness of language. ‘Language,’ he writes, ‘is not a neutral medium that passes freely and easily into the private property of the speaker’s intentions; it is populated – overpopulated – with the intentions of others’ (p. 294). These voices come not just from those individuals we read and or collaborate with but also from the genres and discourses that we write within. As Bakhtin notes, ‘Certain features of language take on the specific flavor of a given genre: they knit together with specific points of view, specific approaches, forms of thinking, nuances and accents characteristic of the given genre’ (p. 289). Heteroglossia helps us understand how the voice of a text is better thought of as a mingling of voices – though the ways in which voices are put into conversation may be attributed to choices an individual author has made.

From a social perspective, in conclusion, voice relates to self- representation and authorial presence but always taking into account the social worlds for and out of which a text is produced. A social view of voice also suggests that voice is inevitable (Burgess and Ivanicˇ, 2010) rather than an optional aesthetic addition that some texts have and others do not. Rather, all texts have voice, and the voice expressed (or perceived) is not simply the property of the author but constructed by the social worlds that the author works within.

# 1.3 Voice as dialogic

Ivanicˇ’s (1998) theoretical framework of writing identity is valuable to the study of voice because it highlights multiple aspects of identity, offering vocabulary for disentangling the personal (what she refers to as ‘autobiographical self’ and ‘self as author’) and social (‘discoursal self’ and ‘possibilities for selfhood’) but also for weaving them together. As others have pointed out, voice is neither controlled solely by writers nor determined by the social worlds within which they write – it is subject to and a result of both writer and social context. Prior (2001) argues that a dialogic notion of voice takes us past this false dichotomy between the personal and social. Conceptualizing voice as dialogue, then, underscores the interaction between the individual and the social and the resulting co-construction of voice. When understood from this interactive or dialogic perspective, issues such as access, power, and interpersonal relations are highlighted as playing a role in the author’s discursive repertoire and construction of voice in different times and spaces of writing.

Viewing voice as dialogic also compels us to look not just to the writer and social context but also to the key role that readers play; for it is the reader’s impressions – which occur within a social setting – that identify voice. Matsuda’s (2001) definition of voice, therefore, offers an important answer to the apparent impasse created by the individual–social binary, describing voice as: ‘… the amalgamative effect of the use of discursive and non-discursive features that language users choose, deliberately or otherwise, from socially available yet ever-changing repertoires’ (p. 41).

Although Peter Elbow’s discussions of voice have most consistently been associated with personal voice, it is noteworthy that Elbow (1994, 1999) too acknowledges the role of the reader in voice construction, stating that ‘voice in a piece of writing is always a matter of interpretation’ (1999: 336). Burgess and Ivanicˇ (2010) equally note the critical importance of the reader in interpreting a writer’s voice, based on the discourses and possibilities for selfhood to which the reader has had access. If a writer’s predictions about readers do not coincide with the discourses and possibilities for selfhood that actual readers bring to a text, a writer’s intended identities misalign with the identities or impressions assigned by readers.

To summarize, this dialogic view of voice offers us a way to take into account both the individual and social dimensions that are unquestionably a part of voice. A dialogic view draws our attention, as well, to the reader and to the ways in which writer and reader interact, co-constructing voice at a particular space and time.

# 2 Researching voice in academic writing

Research into voice in academic writing, while not extensive, is growing and is varied in a healthy way: different theoretical perspectives may be highlighted through distinct methodologies. For example, to study voice from a social and historical perspective, understanding what a writer brings to a text is crucial; Ivanicˇ’s (1998) methodological approach instantiates this theoretical strand, integrating author interviews and text analysis to consider the writer’s intentions as well as intertextual encounters that come to bear on a given text. On the other hand, to study voice from the perspective of stance and engagement, text analysis is the preferred research method (e.g. Hyland, 2008). When carried out on a large scale, it can help us see how groups of writers (e.g. novices and experts) may differ in the linguistic and rhetorical features of their texts that contribute to self-representation.

While empirical studies that focus on the text and/or the author have been critical in building an understanding of voice, these approaches have generally omitted the perspective of the reader in voice construction. If we adopt a dialogic view, readers are an essential part of the framework, and therefore research methods that take them into account have great potential for furthering our understanding of voice as both a theoretical construct and an aspect of writing and writing instruction.

In this section, I describe two studies (Matsuda and Tardy, 2007; Tardy and Matsuda, 2009) that have taken a reader-based approach to researching voice. In doing so, I will highlight some of the major aspects of voice as relevant to academic discourse. The two studies described each consider voice in blind peer review, an important context of academic discourse. Both draw on Matsuda’s (2001) definition of voice as the impression a reader gains from a combination of features. Given the prominent role of the reader in this definition, we would expect that he or she brings his or her own proclivities, social histories, etc. to any reading and that therefore different audiences may construct the voice of the same text in distinct ways.

These two studies examine two similar theoretically oriented research questions regarding voice in academic discourse: (1) Do readers construct an author’s voice in the process of blind peer review, and if so, to what extent? (2) Which discursive and nondiscursive features do readers draw upon in the process of constructing authorial voice? In the following sections, I first describe the general methodology and the answer to the first research question for each study. Next, I offer a discussion of the second research question by integrating the findings from both, hoping to illustrate how this approach might inform our theoretical perspectives on voice in academic discourse.

# 2.1 Matsuda and Tardy (2007): a small-scale construction of authorial voice

This exploratory case study simulated a blind peer review of an academic journal manuscript in which two participants were asked to read and review a manuscript as they would for an actual peer review in their field of rhetoric and composition. The readers were told the journal for which they were reviewing; this was a journal that either reviewer could conceivably be asked to review for, and it was in fact the same publication to which the manuscript was actually submitted (but had not yet been published). The reviewers were instructed to use their typical review process and told that their written evaluation would be shared with the author of the manuscript, just as in an actual peer review. All three participants – the manuscript writer and the two reviewers – were male, native English speakers; one reviewer was a person of color while the other two participants were white.

We held two interviews with each informant ‘reviewer’: the first took place immediately after they had completed the review, and a second was held nearly a month later to share our analysis and gather any additional comments. The first interview asked the readers about their general reactions to the text, their reading and writing processes, the textual features they focused on in evaluating the manuscript, their image of the author and his/her ability and credibility, and, finally, factors that led to their impressions of the writer. Questions specifically related to author impressions were asked only at the end of the interview, with the goal that these then would also be elicited implicitly through other questions about the review process. The readers were not informed of the actual focus of the study until the second interview.

Very early in each interview it was clear that the two reviewers had formed impressions of the manuscript’s author, or had constructed an authorial voice. For example, both had made guesses about the author’s gender and relative professional status, believing that the text was written by a male graduate student or new faculty member. Reviewers also constructed the author as ‘earnest,’ ‘conscientious,’ ‘ambitious,’ and ‘White’ (p. 242). Although these impressions primarily came out as the reviewers discussed their review process with the researcher, assumptions about the author were also embedded in certain ways in the reviewers’ reports. For instance, excessive hedging and personal interaction with the author (through the use of you) used in one of the reviewer’s reports suggested a somewhat delicate tone that struck us as more typical of a senior scholar writing to an assumed novice rather than to an equal peer. The reviewer confirmed this, noting that he wrote his review in a way that was less critical than he could have been ‘because I felt pretty certain that this is a young, inexperienced author’ (p. 242). The second reviewer similarly positioned the manuscript writer as relatively inexperienced through his review, referring to the author (or the work) as ‘a tad bit theoretically naïve’ and having ‘too monolithic a conception of the field’ (p. 242). In response to the first research question, then, this study found that both readers had formed impressions of the author of an anonymous piece of academic writing.

# 2.2 Tardy and Matsuda (2009): a survey on voice parameters

While we were intrigued by the findings of our case study, we realized that it was very small in scale and could not be easily generalized to all academic writing or even to all instances of peer review. We therefore sought to study the same issue on a wider scale, this time adopting a survey methodology. We created a Web-based questionnaire, which was sent to editorial board members of six journals that publish scholarship in applied linguistics, composition studies, rhetoric, professional writing, and teaching English as a second language. The survey included questions about the respondents’ demographic and professional backgrounds, the extent to which they formed impressions of manuscript authors, and what discursive and nondiscursive features may have contributed to those impressions. These questions were sent to a total of 113 board members, out of which 70 responded; these respondents could be characterized as prolific writers, experienced reviewers, and senior scholars in language and/or writing studies. Of the respondents, 83 percent were identified as white and 87 percent as native speakers of English.

Similar to our 2007 study, we found that most of these reviewers reported forming impressions of authors, at least at times. More specifically, 83 percent said that at some point as a reviewer they had formed a sense of the identity of the author of anonymous manuscripts, and 84 percent that they had actively made speculations about an author’s identity. Some readers described forming a sense of an author’s identity as ‘a natural tendency’ (p. 38), ‘inevitable’ (p. 38), and ‘hard to avoid’ (p. 39). Aspects of author identity that respondents made guesses about included experience, disciplinary background, language and ethnic background, nationality, gender, age, institutional affiliation, and level of education. The aspect of identity most commonly speculated upon by these reviewers was experience in the field, with a majority (61 percent) stating they had made guesses about this authorial characteristic when reviewing a manuscript.

# 2.3 Theoretical exploration of studies’ findings

Together, these two studies suggest that while not all readers may form impressions of the authors of anonymous texts (at least at a conscious level), a majority do. These findings would seem to imply that voice does play a role in academic discourse. However, the impressions that a reader forms of an author – or, more specifically, the aspects of identity that a reader attends to – are unlikely to be static across readers or tasks. First, we did find some similarities across tasks in that both our 2007 case study readers and a majority of our 2009 survey respondents formed impressions of writers’ experience in the field. It seems likely that this feature is of particular importance in the genre and activity that both of our studies examine – the blind peer review process. While other researchers have noted the role of genre in voice construction, few have also highlighted activity or task. The 2007 and 2009 studies described here suggest that activity is also a crucial element of voice construction because it directs the reader’s purpose and thus is likely to encourage him or her to attend to certain aspects of the text and author.

At the same time, differences in the construction of authorial identity were also found across these two studies. For instance, issues like language background and nationality did not come up in our case study research, with the readers likely assuming the writer to be a US native English speaker and thus not noting this aspect of identity. On the other hand, 43 percent of our survey respondents stated they had guessed an author’s language background, and 33 percent had speculated about nationality. Because many of these reviewers came from editorial boards of international journals, it is likely that they had encountered many manuscripts written by scholars from various countries and language backgrounds, being themselves located in a range of countries. In contrast, our two case study readers, both US-born and USbased scholars, were asked to carry out a review for a US-based journal. They most likely assumed the author to be a US native English speaker, and nothing in the manuscript served to disrupt that assumption. In other words, there was nothing that stood out to our reviewers as nonnative English speaker or non-US American, keeping their assumption of a US native English writer intact. Thus, the issue of markedness seems important for studies of voice, as impressions may be assumed or changed by both conformity to expectations (that is, unmarkedness) and by deviations from expectations (markedness). Several of our survey respondents, indeed, noted that speculations about author identity were often sparked by departures from discursive norms or expectations, with one reviewer writing, ‘Usually it is triggered by anomalies in the text’ (p. 43).

One of our two case study readers formed an impression of the manuscript author’s ethnic origin, and only 14 percent of our survey respondents said that they had made guesses about ethnicity. Again, together these two findings suggest some interesting theoretical insight. The case study reviewer who remarked on ethnicity was himself a person of color, and 40 percent of our survey respondents who stated they had made guesses about an author’s ethnicity were also either nonwhite or Arab (much higher than the overall proportion of nonwhite survey respondents, which was just 13 percent). While causal claims are not appropriate here, these findings do suggest that certain aspects of author identity may become salient only to some readers and with some texts or topics. In other words, a reader’s personal identity may come to bear on his or her construction of another author’s voice.

After identifying the extent to which readers formed impressions of authors in blind peer review contexts, both the case study and survey attempted to identify discursive and nondiscursive features that contributed to those impressions. Our case study interviews were nondirective, asking the two readers only open-ended questions that allowed them to consider any aspect of the manuscript. Several features were identified by both readers as contributing to their constructions of voice, including rhetorical moves, representation of work in the field, knowledge of topic, syntax, citations/references, and mechanics/editing. Other features were identified by just one reviewer: scope of the manuscript, theoretical lens, gender/race lens, choice of journal, personal growth, use/misuse of terms, inconsistencies in style, concision, and formatting.

Drawing on these findings, we offered our survey respondents a list of 19 discursive and nondiscursive features, asking them to check any that they believed might contribute to their impressions of authors. The most commonly checked items included breadth or depth of knowledge, topic choice, and representation of the field, reflecting some similarities with our case study findings. Items that the fewest respondents identified as relevant were use of particular genre conventions, choice of journal, and use of citation style. One methodological challenge here is that, in many cases, voice construction may be largely an unconscious process. Certainly, our case study design relied on readers’ conscious awareness of what contributed to their impressions of authors. Providing specific features to readers in our survey study may have helped to make more conscious the process of constructing voice. Still, these studies have not identified an exhaustive list of features that may contribute to voice, and indeed such a list is unlikely to be possible nor is it necessarily desirable.

One reason why a focus on discrete features in the construction of voice may be problematic is that voice seems to be a cumulative (or, in Matsuda’s (2001) words, amalgamative) effect. In our case study, for example, one reviewer noted difficulty in identifying features of the text that led to his impressions, explaining that it was more of a general sense he built rather than something tied to specific features. Similarly, some survey respondents stated that they found it difficult to attribute their impressions to specific textual features.

It is also worthwhile pointing out that in our case study we interviewed the author of the reviewed manuscript and shared the readers’ impressions with him. The interview revealed an interesting disconnect between the author’s intended voice and the voice that was constructed by the readers, specifically in relation to the ‘masculine’ voice, which the author had worked hard to eliminate. This finding, while not necessarily surprising, does further support the argument that the study of voice must take into account readers’ impressions rather than (solely) writer’s intentions or textual features, and that theories of voice must also distinguish between authors’ intentions or impressions of their own voice and readers’ constructions of authors’ voices.

The two studies described here are neither conclusive nor generalizable to understanding voice in all academic discourse: they consider voice construction in a single genre (the research article) and a single activity (the blind peer review). At the same time, the genre studied is a common one in academic writing and the activity is at its heart evaluative, therefore sharing at least some similarities with teacher evaluation of student work (though the activities are not identical). The findings of these studies and their theoretical implications then contribute to an understanding of how voice operates within academic discourse.

# Conclusion

As this chapter has attempted to demonstrate, rather than being a belletristic concept that can be dismissed as unimportant to academic writing, voice is a robust theoretical concept that has much to offer the study of academic discourse. Scholarship on voice in academic contexts has taken on diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives, all of which have contributed to building a more complex construct that encompasses and recombines both individual and social perspectives. Because issues like stance, self-representation, and authorial presence – all aspects of voice – are critical to the reception of academic texts, continued research into these interpersonal and dialogic aspects of writing is of great value. The chapters in this collection will no doubt help us build the insights necessary to support learners as they attempt to contend with this critical, though often less understood, aspect of academic writing.

# Part II Stance and Voice in Professional Genres

# 4 Voice and Stance as APPRAISAL: Persuading and Positioning in Research Writing across Intellectual Fields

Susan Hood University of Technology, Sydney

# Introduction

This chapter discusses the general concepts of stance and voice from the framework of systemic functional linguistics (SFL). It opens with a brief introduction to some aspects of SFL theory that inform their exploration, focusing on the subsystem of APPRAISAL. The second part of the chapter describes some applications of the framework in the domain of academic discourse, in particular in analyses of evaluative roles and positioning strategies in research writing within various intellectual fields. The studies represented here reflect a logogenetic approach to discourse analysis, in other words, a focus on tracking unfolding evaluative meanings in instances of texts, highlighting both their complexity and ways they interact. In this respect the approach differs significantly from corpus-based methods while at the same time offering a complementary standpoint. Although the illustrative accounts of the research are necessarily synoptic, they give some indication of the empirical potential of APPRAISAL theory, as well as an opportunity to stress some transdisciplinary explorations of how writers legitimate claims to knowledge.

# 1 Positioning stance and voice in systemic functional linguistics

A basic tenet of SFL theory is an appreciation of meaning as metafunctional. Meaning in language is theorized as always and simultaneously ideational, interpersonal and textual (Halliday, 1985/94; Martin, 1992;

Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004). Ideationally, language is about something; it functions to construe kinds of experience. Interpersonally, language negotiates social relations; it enacts roles and functions to share values. Textually, language presents flows of information; it distributes meanings in ways that are functional to modes of interaction. In discussions of voice and stance we are primarily locating ourselves in the realm of interpersonal meaning.

# 1.1 Realizing APPRAISAL

We can explore realizations of interpersonal meaning at any or all strata of language in choices in phonology (Halliday and Greaves, 2008), lexico-grammar (Halliday, 1985/94; Halliday and Matthiessen, 1999) and discourse semantics (Martin, 1992; Martin and Rose, 2007). The explanations and descriptions in this chapter are primarily focused on interpersonal meaning in discourse semantics. This realm of the larger theory is referred to as the system of APPRAISAL (Martin and White, 2005), which is captured diagrammatically at a very abstracted level in Figure 4.1.

The system network in Figure 4.1 represents three means by which evaluative meaning choices can be realized in the language system of

![](img/075de86a2a72a85e9a21b91c49761e8b8c8d36e4b97d5bc2b328a257f61a735d.jpg)  
Figure 4.1 An abstract representation of the system of appraisal

English. Subsystems include those of ATTITUDE (kinds of values that can be expressed), GRADUATION (options for scaling meanings to express attitude by degree) and ENGAGEMENT (means for introducing the positions of others into the discourse and for negotiating with those positions). For extended elaborations and exemplifications of these networks the reader is referred to Martin and White (2005) and Hood (2010).

Each dimension of APPRAISAL opens up more extensive system networks of choices. ATTITUDE, for example, is further differentiated in terms of the kind of value expressed, the polarity, whether it is inscribed or invoked, and the means for invocation (Martin, 2000). Instances of inscribed ATTITUDE are identified as encoding an explicit positive or negative value that is gradable (e.g. good/very good). Attitudinal terms may express affect as feelings or emotions (e.g. interested, satisfied), appreciation as the valuing of things (e.g. important, complex) or judgement in appraising people and their behaviour (e.g. courageous, honest).

The adjustment of meanings by degree is represented in APPRAISAL theory as the realm of GRADUATION. Meanings may be scaled as degrees of FORCE or of FOCUS. The scaling of important to very important represents GRADUATION as FORCE, in this case intensifying a quality. Alternatively, where a value is expressed as an entity, as in importance, we can adjust FORCE as quantification (number/amount), as in more/much/little importance. Values encoded in or around processes can also be graded in intensity, as in rigorously explored. While the examples above illustrate the scaling of attitudinal meanings, non-attitudinal (experiential) meanings can also be scaled through being made relative. In the context of academic literature reviews, for example, we frequently encounter descriptions of experiential aspects of research that are graduated in this way. This might include features such as study size (a small number of participants/large-scale study), number of supporting studies ( few researchers, well documented), location in time as relative proximity (a more recent study), scope of usage (not/widely applied), and so on. Graduation that functions in this way to ‘subjectify an objective meaning’ (Hood, 2010) is said to ‘flag’ an attitudinal interpretation (Martin and White, 2005).

The other dimension of GRADUATION, that of FOCUS, has to do with the sharpening or softening of boundaries around categorical meanings. A categorical boundary around an abstract entity can be sharpened or softened (real research; vaguely relevant study). The categorical boundaries around processes can also be sharpened or softened by adjusting degrees of completion (e.g. tried to show) or actualization (seems to show/ definitely shows). Again the grading of the non-attitudinal (experiential)

meanings encodes a subjective positioning on behalf of the writer, and hence an indication to the reader to interpret attitudinally (Hood, 2010; Hood and Martin, 2007).

The third dimension of APPRAISAL, that of ENGAGEMENT, deals with the sourcing of positions represented in the discourse, and the options for negotiating with them. ENGAGEMENT identifies in the first instance the means available for bringing voices other than the writer’s into a text, either explicitly or implicitly. Resources for doing so include projection (Anderson suggests that ...), modality and negation (it might be that ...; it is not that ...) and counter-expectancy (However, ... ; … only ...). The ENGAGEMENT system then generates a network of options for expanding or contracting dialogic space for these alternative voices or positions (White, 2003; Martin and White, 2005). It is in this context of ENGAGEMENT that we encounter one use of the term voice in SFL research. Descriptions of discourse as monoglossic or heteroglossic are frequently glossed as single-voiced or multi-voiced. When we consider the notion of voice from this perspective we can investigate, for example, the extent to which explicitly inscribed or implied sources of propositional meanings are co-present in a text, and the degree to which space for negotiation with those ‘voices’ is expanded or contracted.

# 1.2 Instantiating APPRAISAL

The discussion to this point has focused on evaluative meanings in language concerning realization; on how APPRAISAL theory informs what we identify as having the potential to do evaluative work in discourse, and how it provides a framework for the interpretation of choices as meaningful. We can also explore questions of stance and voice from the perspective of instantiation (Halliday and Matthiessen, 1999; Martin, 2010). Instantiation is represented as a cline at the upper end of which is the full meaning potential of a system of language. Figure 4.2 captures this cline from the perspective of evaluation (Martin and White, 2005), where APPRAISAL embodies the evaluative meaning potential of language as a system.

The features on the cline in Figure 2 are expanded upon here as:

1. Appraisal (system) – the global potential of the language for making evaluative meanings;   
2. Key (register) – situational variants or sub-selections of that potential – typically reconfiguration of the probabilities of the occurrence of particular evaluative meaning-making options or for the co- occurrence of options;   
3. Stance (text-type) – sub-selections of evaluative options within text; patterns of use of evaluative options within a given ‘key’ associated with particular rhetorical objectives and the construction of authorial personae;   
4. Evaluation (text) – instantiation of evaluative options in text;   
5. Reaction (reading) – the take-up of evaluative meanings in a text according to the listener/reader’s subjectively determined reading position; the attitudinal positions activated by the reader as a result of their interaction with the text.

![](img/2f4b1e113cf63412cda12f359142fb194034a9705c25f4b7eb5280eabda12930.jpg)  
Figure 4.2 Cline of instantiation for evaluation (with reference to Martin and White, 2005: 164)

Reading down from the top of the cline, the full potential of APPRAISAL resources is progressively constrained in the instantiation of particular registers and genres. In other words, there are limits on the kinds of evaluative resources that get taken up from the system. These constrained configurations are referred to as registerial keys. Moving further down the cline, a given registerial key can give rise to a range of groupings of types of texts, for example texts that praise or condemn some phenomenon. The constraints on configurations of APPRAISAL that characterize such types of texts are referred to as stance. Progressing down to the level of a single text, specific APPRAISAL choices are referred to as evaluation. The resources of evaluation in an instance of text are limited both by the text as an instance of generalized type and by the text as an instance of register and genre. Finally, the evaluative meaning that is instantiated in a single text offers a constrained meaning potential for the reader. The reader’s instantiation as interpretation is referred to as reaction. Reaction is thus constrained by configurations of evaluation, stance and registerial key. We can equally view the cline from the bottom up and consider how more evaluative meaning potential of the system is opened up as we shift focus from a single instance of text, to a generalized type, to a register/genres, and to the full evaluative meaning potential of a language.

# Voice as key

In Figure 4.2 the term key captures the ways in which patterns of evaluative resources construct positional roles associated with given registers/ genres. It is these registerial keys in discourse that in SFL research are sometimes referred to as voices. From the perspective of instantiation, then, voice is more or less synonymous with key: key is the configuration of APPRAISAL resources that enact a registerial role; voice is the registerial role that is enacted in those APPRAISAL choices (Martin and White, 2005: 161). One is the complement of the other.

This concept of voice as key derives initially from White’s (1998) study of APPRAISAL in mainstream broadsheet journalism and is usefully exemplified in examples from that field. White identifies three conventionalized media roles distinguished in terms of the constraints on the evaluative choices that can be taken up. He refers to these roles as reporter voice, correspondent voice and commentator voice. The reporter voice is constrained, for example, in the use of direct inscribed and unmediated expressions of ATTITUDE. There is no authorial affect and judgement is encoded indirectly (invoked) or attributed to others. The correspondent voice is one in which, for example, the inscription of judgement as social esteem is unconstrained but judgement as social sanction is curtailed and if present is typically attributed. In commentator voice a writer has ‘no co-textual constraints on judgement’ with ‘free occurrence of unmediated social sanction and social esteem’. These voices correspond to different media genres, namely ‘news’, ‘analysis’ and ‘comment/opinion’ (Martin and White, 2005: 165 – for a greatly elaborated description see Martin and White, 2005: 173). Coffin (2002) takes the same approach to an analysis of voice in her study of secondary school discourses in history; the system of key she identifies in this context is composed of recorder voice (closely resembling the reporter voice of media discourses), interpreter voice (resembling correspondent voice) and adjudicator voice (resembling commentator voice).

While we may assign institutional role labels to these voices (as in reporter, commentator, correspondent) it is important to recognize that the terms key and voice are semiotic constructs. They relate to the construal of identities or roles in the language of texts. It is also important to note when we talk of configurations of APPRAISAL resources in genres/ registers, text-types or texts, that we are not just talking about frequencies or otherwise of the occurrence of a single option (although such might be evident), but rather configurations as couplings of options, and even syndromes of couplings across subsystems of APPRAISAL.

Up to now we have considered evaluative meaning from the perspective of realization, focusing on the kinds of meaning choices available, and from the perspective of instantiation, focusing on the ways in which the evaluative potential of a language is taken up in particular contexts and texts.

In the second part of the chapter I briefly review a number of studies of evaluation in academic discourse that draw on aspects of APPRAISAL theory in SFL. The textual sites of the studies are academic research articles (RAs) from a variety of disciplines. The first study explores patterns of evaluative choices that characterize different subgenres in the introductions to RAs from the hard and social sciences. It represents a perspective on voices as registerial keys in academic research writing. The second study explores this issue of voice interpreted in the sense of heteroglossia, that is as propositional meanings that can be sourced beyond the writer of the text. The focus in this case is not on the evaluative positions they project, but rather on what role the projecting sources are made to play in the representation of legitimate propositional claims.

# 2 From theory to practice: APPRAISAL and genre in academic research articles

We have begun to explore some of the technicality in SFL around APPRAISAL but nothing has been said so far on the construct of genre in SFL. While in some theoretical traditions it makes sense to talk of the ‘genre’ of the RA or perhaps the ‘genre’ of the introduction to an RA, from an SFL perspective, both the longer text as well as the introductory segment constitute macro-genres or complexes of genres (Martin, 1992; Martin and Rose, 2008). Hood (2010) describes the macro-genre of the RA introduction as the ‘research warrant’ functioning to legitimate the writer’s study. The typical configuration of genres in the macro-genre of the RA introduction in both the hard and soft sciences is a sequence of evaluative report and description genres. Writers construct reports on the object of study, reports on categories of scholarship relevant to the object of study, descriptions of specific studies, and descriptions of features of the writer’s own study as a transition to a more detailed account of research design.

# 2.1 Registerial keys in academic research writing

These genres of report and description foreground experiential meanings and are at the same time thoroughly evaluative; they function to both represent and to persuade. Hood (2004, 2010) identified ways in which configurations of APPRAISAL shift from one genre to another.

Reports on the object of study within the RA introduction function to provide some background to, and rationale for, the choice of focus or topic. In such contexts writers frequently express inscribed ATTITUDE in multiple instances. The relative strength and density of the attitudinal expressions function to compel reader alignment with the worthiness of the object of study as a focus for research. Such phases of text are evident in [1] from an educational journal, and [2] from the field of applied physics. The kind of ATTITUDE expressed in each varies with the specific object of study.

[1] The current phenomenal success $[ +$ appreciation] with young (and older) readers of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books confirms the enduring capacity $[ +$ appreciation] of literary narratives to engage the enthusiasm $[ +$ affect] of young people in the 21st century. But the interactions of many young enthusiasts $[ +$ affect] with the story world of Harry Potter extends well beyond the covers of the books and their movie adaptations, into the world of cyberspace where today’s young people are so much at home. [Unsworth, 2008]

[2] Hygrothermal analysis has become more important in building design as moisture damages $[ -$ appreciation] have become one of the main $[ +$ appreciation] causes of building envelope deterioration $[ -$ appreciation]. Water and moisture can cause structural damage $[ -$ appreciation], reduce the thermal resistance $[ -$ appreciation] of building materials, change the physical properties of materials, and deform $[ -$ appreciation] materials. [Kalamees et al., 2006]

The discourse of evaluative reports on the object of study may be more or less heteroglossic (multi-voiced), although explicitly named projecting sources are often backgrounded or even absent as in [1] and [2] (see Section 3 for elaborated discussion of resources for heteroglossia).

Other genres that are frequently evident in RA introductions are reports on categories of scholarship and descriptions of specific contributions to knowledge within a field. We associate these with the notion of a literature review and in both cases they report/describe in evaluative terms, functioning to position a readership to align or disalign with other positions and ultimately to arrive at alignment with the writer that there is space for new knowledge within the field. These genres typically contrast with reports on the object of study in their configurations of APPRAISAL resources. They are substantially heteroglossic, that is, inclusive of multiple positions and sources. A significant finding is that they are relatively sparse in inscriptions of ATTITUDE and display instead a strong preference for invoking ATTITUDE through resources of GRADUATION whereby experiential meanings are made relative and in the process are given a subjective orientation. This means for implying an evaluative position in relation to other scholarship is evident in [3] and [4]. The GRADUATION is indicated in italics and coded in brackets after each instance:

[3] While many $[ +$ force: quantity] researchers have theorized about the importance of writing, (…) few $[ -$ force: quantity] have taken an empirical approach to examining $[ +$ force: vigour] the purpose of children’s every day writing practices and written work in school settings. In attempting $[ -$ focus: completion] to fill this gap in research, they show $[ +$ focus: actualization] that teachers are the primary audience for students’ writing and that students seek to please the teacher by choosing topics and language that they think will be favored. [Wright, 2008]

[4] Green’s study offers a case study exploration $[ +$ force: vigour] of the experiences of ten different $[ +$ force: scope] students, and in doing so moves on from $[ +$ force: distance] narrowly $[ -$ force: scope] defined ‘literacy practices’ to uncover a number of $[ +$ force: quantity] broader $[ +$ force: scope] issues which make up these students’ school literacy experiences. [Yates, 1999]

A reliance on resources of GRADUATION rather than inscriptions of ATTITUDE avoids a dichotomous positioning of other contributions to knowledge as on the side of ‘good’ or ‘bad’. Instead, contributions are positioned relative to one another along clines that can represent an array of dimensions of FORCE: as intensity, quantity, scope, location; and of FOCUS as specification of attention, completion of a process and actualization of product in knowledge production. These and other options for grading meanings are evident in Figure 4.3.

The discussion above should not be read to mean that academic res earch writers never inscribe ATTITUDE in evaluating other contributions to knowledge. They do. However, Hood (2004, 2010) suggests that where we do find instances of inscribed ATTITUDE evaluating scholarship, they are more likely to be construed as appreciation (the less personal category), rather than affect or judgement. This is particularly so where a negative evaluation is being expressed. So, for example, the writer is more likely to write

Figure 4.3 Network of semantic options for GRADUATION (from Hood, 2010)

The design of the study is flawed $[ -$ appreciation] in a number of respects.

than

The researchers neglected $[ -$ judgement] to take account of this factor in designing the study.

Hood (2004) also suggests that where a specific study is identified for more substantial description, the polarity of the inscriptions is more likely to be positive.

The study referred to above illustrates some of the resources available to writers of academic research papers for expressing evaluative stance as attitudinal positioning, pointing to ways in which expressions of attitude are relatively constrained or unconstrained in the writing of particular component genres in the research warrant. In the light of the earlier theoretical discussions, the patterning of resources of APPRAISAL in the different sub-genres of the introduction can be said to represent different evaluative keys in the discourse. For example, in [1] and [2] that which is being appraised is the object of study, and the voice construed is one of observer (Hood, 2004). This voice as a registerial key is able to display a relatively full palette of attitudinal categories (affect, judgement and appreciation), although patterns of choices will reflect the specific object of study. In contrast, [3] and [4] are relatively reliant on invocations of ATTITUDE, especially on resources of GRADUATION flagging an attitudinal reading. Where there are inscriptions of ATTITUDE the preference is for appreciation rather than judgement or affect. Here it is contributions to knowledge in the field that are being appraised, and the constructed voice is one of critic (see Hood, 2004). Both observer voice and critic voice speak from the field of research but in the process appraise different phenomena.

A third potential voice that can come into play in the construction of the research warrant is that of participant. Participant voice differs from observer voice in terms of the field from which it projects propositional meanings. It is a voice from within the field of the object of study rather than from the field of research. This voice functions to support the writer’s claims for the legitimacy of the object of study as research focus and often gains a space in the discourse in the context of recontextualized story genres of one kind or another. It more strongly associates with research in the humanities and with ‘ethnographic’ approaches in the social sciences. Participant voice as registerial key may express evaluated representations of the world that are unconstrained in choices of attitude. However, the persuasive power of the propositional meanings projected by participant voice may rest not in compelling expressions or attitude but in an assumed legitimacy that comes from being an insider. Participant voice is typically projected by observer voice as in [5]. In this instance the participant voice is itself evaluative, but as noted above, need not be so:

[5] Aileen, an eighth grade African-American student in a district with school choice at the high-school level, was having a conversation about the process of applying to high schools with several of her peers and me. She said that it was unfair $[ -$ judgement] that they did not admit her to the performing arts school because of her low grades in science and math: ‘Why do they care about $[ +$ appreciation] math and science if the school is supposed to teach art? I won’t even need science since I am going to be an artist.’ Her statements on the issue cohered with others she had made over the course of the school year expressing frustration $[ -$ affect] that she was required to learn science, as she did not feel that it was going to be useful $[ -$ appreciation] to here in her chosen life path. [Olitsky, 2006]

# 2.2 Projecting sources: voice and visibility in academic research writing

In a second study of persuasion in academic research writing, Hood (2011) considers the notion of voice with respect to heteroglossic discourse. The study explores how projecting sources are represented differently in different disciplines and how these variations play a part in establishing the legitimacy of claims to knowledge.

Hood (2011) focuses on the introductory sections of published research articles drawn from different intellectual fields spanning the natural and social sciences and the humanities. The texts loosely associate around aspects of science – from scientific research itself to studies of science education. In the case of the latter category the examples are drawn from a volume of an applied linguistics journal on science education and from a volume of a cultural studies journal on science education. While typicality is not addressed here, each instance is considered to be legitimate discourse within its intellectual field, given its publication in a reputable journal.

# Identifying projection

The first step in a linguistic analysis is to identify projecting sources in the text, be they the writer herself explicitly represented as saying or knowing or another source introduced into the text by the writer. Such projections can be realized congruently in the grammar through mental or verbal processes, as in

Li (2008) suggests that other factors may also influence the findings or in what Halliday and Matthiessen (2004) refer to as pre-projected facts, as in

Li’s study showed that the method was effective.

From a discourse semantic perspective, projecting sources can additionally be identified in terms of their relationship to nominalized processes, as in

Anderson (2004) offers a number of suggestions: … as well as graphically in textual notations of bracketing, or as sub- or superscript numerals, as in

other factors may also influence the findings (Li, 2008) reduction … is carried out using stronger reducing agents ….2

Specific sources can also be implied but not named, as in

Studies that highlight the role of motivation abound in the literature.

The projecting sources identified are then considered in terms of the kinds of meaning potential that is instantiated in their representation. Projecting sources may be agentive or not in the clause, may be lexicalized or not, and if lexicalized may be individualized or generalized, human or semiotic, and may additionally be qualified experientially or interpersonally. Hood (2011) then proposes that these different representations of projecting sources can be plotted along a continuum in terms of relative visibility for the projecting source as a (human) knower. Patterns of preference can then be considered for the texts from the hard and soft sciences and the humanities.

# Visibility of sources

When the kind of disciplinary home is taken into account, the projecting voices in the science texts are seen to associate more strongly with the less visible end of the continuum. Dominantly in this discourse the author/researcher is omitted altogether and referenced only by means of a super-/sub-script notation. The source must be retrieved from an end list, reducing its prominence almost to the point of invisibility, as in

Sodium borohydride can, however, be easily modified to stronger or more selective reducing agent.3 [Saeed and Ashraf, 2006]

In such constructions the source of the projection is made more or less irrelevant to the propositional meanings projected. We might say that knowledge is foregrounded over knowers (see Maton, 2007).

The discourse of the hard science texts drifts minimally toward the visible in instances where sources are agentive in the clause structure but are semiotic rather than human, as in

Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain the chemical composition of infectious prions … [Supattapone, 2010]

There are only occasional instances in the hard science texts where sources are represented as named researchers, as in

Wang et al. demonstrate the importance of cofactors for producing recombinant infectious prions in vitro (5). [Supattapone, 2010]

The projecting voices in the humanities texts occupy some of the same ground as the texts from other disciplinary domains. They include, for example, some instances of projecting human researcher voices as in

Davies and Harre (2000) speak about ‘positioning’ [Brandt, 2008]

However, they also occupy the more highly visible end of the continuum. At the extreme of visibility are specific human sources made integral to the flow of discourse, and elaborated in terms of their mater ial or metaphoric locus, as in

McKinney (1998), a member of the Potawatomi tribe, uses ‘multivocality’ or a crosscultural approach in her academic research (…) to represent her ‘self’.

Lowrey (1997), from Laguna Pueblo, writes a self-study (...). [Brandt, 2008]

The disposition or gaze of the projecting source may also be elaborated, in this case in relation to the writer herself as a projecting source, in

In this story I position myself as a white Western woman and my values, beliefs, prejudices and aspirations form a complex lens through which I have come to understand myself … [Ryan, 2008]

In each case the instantiation of more meaning potential around the source implies that that information is relevant to the status of what is projected. The knower is represented as having relevance to what is known.

Representations of projecting sources in the social science texts tend to occupy the middle ground, reaching neither the extremes of invisibility of sources in the hard science texts nor the extreme visibility evident in humanities texts. They frequently include many instances of agentive human researcher voices, as in

Goodwin (1994) also reports on the constitution of scientific phenomena. [Viechnicki, 2008]

Sources drift to the less visible where projecting human voices are excluded from the clause structure, in what Swales (1990) refers to as non-integral citation. The projecting source that remains agentive is frequently an abstract semiotic entity, as in ‘recent work’ in

Recent work in science studies has highlighted the social nature of knowledge production in science and has drawn attention to the important role played by the scientific community (…) in coming to agreement about what should count as a discovery, or a new fact, in a given field (Jasanoff, Markle, Petersen, and Pinch, 1995; Latour, 1987). [Viechnicki, 2008]

There are also representations of collectives of human researchers, as in

While many researchers have theorized about the importance of writing, (…) few have taken an empirical approach to examining … [Wright, 2008]

This occupation of the middle ground in the social science texts is in line with Wignell’s (2007: 202) representation of the social sciences as having ‘evolved as a hybrid of the language of the physical sciences and the language of the humanities’ and always in ‘a kind of dynamic tension’ between the two. The continuum of prominence or visibility in the representation of projecting sources is illustrated in Figure 4.4.

# Visibility: foregrounding knowers or knowledge

In her analysis of the prominence given to voices as projecting sources, Hood (2011) engages in a transdisciplinary dialogue, connecting the linguistic exploration of the prominence and relevance of projecting sources in academic research writing with developments in the sociology of knowledge. She references Bernstein’s (1999, 2000) identification of intellectual fields as ‘knowledge structures’, and pays particular attention to the developments of that theory as legitimation code theory or LCT in Maton (2007, 2010). Maton extends the idea of disciplines as ways of structuring knowledge to encompass also the structuring of knowers, as ‘knowledge–knower structures’.

![](img/165c7a0a44d8b318c04483e8634686bbd8481f5bcfcacb0f47de9b6f9455b67c.jpg)  
Figure 4.4 Visibility in the representation of projecting sources (from Hood, 2011)

Importantly, Maton (2007) identifies the underlying principles that construct different intellectual fields as different kinds of specialization codes. One principle is that of the relative strength of the epistemic relations $( \mathrm { E R + } / \mathrm { E R - } )$ to do with what can be known and the procedures for arriving at knowledge claims. The other principle is the relative strength of the social relations $( \mathrm { S R } + / \mathrm { S R } - )$ to do with who can be a legitimate knower in the field. Where the epistemic relations are stronger $\mathrm { ( E R + ) }$ and the social relations are weaker (SR−) the resultant specialization code of legitimation is described as a knowledge code. Where we have $\mathrm { S R + }$ and ER− the resultant specialization code of legitimation is described as a knower code.

In a process of transdisciplinary translation, Hood (2011) suggests that the relative visibility of sources that gives them prominence in relation to projected claims, as identified in the humanities texts, can be interpreted from the perspective of LCT as an indication of the relative strength of SR over ER $( \mathrm { S R } + / \mathrm { E R } - )$ , and reflective of a knower code. In contrast, the science texts display a relative strength of ER over SR $( \mathrm { E R } + / \mathrm { S R } - )$ and thus a knowledge code. The representations of sources of propositional claims are interpreted as one indication of fundamental differences in strategies for the legitimation of knowledge across different kinds of disciplines.

# Summary

From the perspective of APPRAISAL theory in SFL, questions of stance and voice in academic discourse are explored as complexes of evaluative choices that interact in unfolding discourse. In the first part of this chapter I have provided brief and relatively synoptic accounts of some aspects of APPRAISAL theory. Readers are referred to several key texts in which they can explore these and other dimensions in greater depth should they wish to do so. In the second part these resources have been further explained through recent research into evaluation in academic research writing. It is my hope that the analyses presented serve to illustrate the importance of both quantitative and qualitative approaches to explorations of evaluation.

I conclude with an important caution with respect to the terminology we use and the clarity with which we need to articulate the scope or limitations of the technical meanings it encapsulates. If we are to engage fruitfully in dialogue across different traditions of theory and method in explorations of evaluative meaning in discourses, then it is imperative that we not assume that shared wordings mean shared theoretical constructs. To do so is bound to cause confusion or misrepresentation. At the same time it is clear that to appreciate fully the ways in which evaluation is theorized or interpreted in another’s model is far from an easy task. It means reading carefully into another body of scholarship, in some cases one that represents a quite different kind of knowledge–knower structure with different strategies of legitimation (as discussed above with reference to Maton, 2007, 2010 and see also Hood, 2007). We may find the task challenging and even insufficiently rewarding. Our motivation to tackle it will no doubt be influenced by the questions that we want answers to, and perhaps by a need to initiate others into a diverse field of scholarship.

# 5 Stance in Academic Bios

Polly Tse University of Hong Kong

This chapter examines the genre of academic bio which, as a common practice in scholarly publishing, accompanies a research article to provide information about the author. As such, academic bio is an extended form of auto/biographical practices where a person is called upon to provide a narrative about themselves, or in Goffman’s words, to engage in the ‘presentation of self’ (Goffman, 1959). This explicit selfrepresentation in academic bio sits in stark contrast to the prescribed anonymity of the article itself, for whereas too much personal exposure is conventionally discouraged in the objective report of research findings, in academic bios authors are invited to unmask their presence and compose a narrative of their scholarly self and professional credentials. While such self-portrait is typically restricted to a little space of 50–100 words, its brevity and self-reflexive nature may render it a periphery status compared with other academic genres. At first glance, its relevance to the key academic goals of establishing claims and knowledge seems minimal and its condensed and relatively unvarying form does not seem to invite in-depth linguistic exploration. But as I shall demonstrate in this chapter, authors are able to manipulate this limited space to manage a public voice and claim a specialist position in their communities. In fact the highly selective choices made by academics in crafting a disciplinary aligned presence open up an interesting area for research into identity construction and self-positioning.

In what follows, I shall elaborate on these arguments by briefly considering the ways in which academic bios may be relevant to constructing a scholarly self and professional stance consistent with various disciplinary values. The discussion will be extended through textual analyses of a corpus of 600 bios which accompanied research articles taken from three disciplines. In so doing, I attempt to offer an account of the academic bio, examine its roles in academic self-representation and stance-taking, as well as explore disciplinary variations in these undertakings.

# Academic bio and stance

There is a long tradition of auto/biographies publishing to tell stories of the lives of eminent writers and scholars (Parke, 2002). These auto/ biographies are often of monograph length, providing rich sources for examining identity construction at both individual and community levels and for tracing the historical and cultural development in knowledge fields (e.g. Shortland and Yeo, 1996; Sodergvist, 2007). In the social sciences, for example, auto/biographies have been approached from the sociocultural and the sociolinguistic perspectives which respectively use such auto/biographical texts as material in studying lives in their social contexts and as reflection of individuals’ personality or identity construction (Alasuutari, 1997). Most of this identity research, however, relies on commercially produced life stories which are often tailored for the audience’s tastes with the help of the editors and publishers. These accounts of lives are therefore ‘not authentic’ (Burgos, 1988: 17, cited in Alasuutari, 1997: 4) and cannot be considered as faithful representations of lives or one’s identity.

At the same time, representativeness of research from the sociolinguistic perspective which focuses on directly collecting individuals’ views and interpretation of their beliefs and past actions would be equally tamed by the agenda and direct intervention of the interviewers (Alasuutari, 1997). What this means is, for auto/biographical work to be genuinely useful in exploring the values and beliefs of oneself and one’s community, there is a need to capture the same kinds of deliberately constructed identity claims where the elicitation is not the motive for the telling/selling and is unaffected by the interactions between the interviewers and the authors of these texts. In other words, we have to explore identity claims in more everyday contexts which embody one’s understanding and practices in achieving specific goals. One such attempt has been taken up by Miller and Morgan (1993) who, as a ‘disinterested observer’ (p. 133), examined the academic CV as a form of auto/biographical work and showed how a common culture and a shared set of rules and expectations were observed by the writers and audiences of these texts. The present study extends this previous work into the relatively low-profile genre of the academic bio which, similar to the CVs examined in Miller and Morgan (1993), is not produced for the researchers, but is naturally occurring text constructed for a genuine purpose that carries implications for the author.

The often mandatory accompaniment of a bio in academic research publication highlights its appeal to readers who are interested in knowing more about the author behind the text. Such notes on the author are not a mere embellishment, but may aid readers in interpreting the research article attached by examining the background and credibility of the author, as well as their theoretical alliance which may have shaped the author’s thinking. Authors are therefore advised to take bio as ‘another opportunity to enlist readers and to establish [their] authority to do the kind of research addressed in [their] report’ (Wolcott, 1990: 80). Almost always, a bio is not a pure and plain account of oneself, but an account which puts its writer in a positive light. This is not dissimilar to what Roberts et al. (2005) refer to as a ‘reflected best self’ which is a selfportrait of our own strengths and contributions. We learn about what other fellow academics value about us as a professional member through our interpretations of experiences and interactions in the scholarly community, and accordingly craft a self-portrait which matches the qualities that are appreciated in the academic context. Bruner (2001), borrowing Nelson Goodman’s term, notes that this is ‘an act of entrenchment’ in that ‘we wish to present ourselves to others (and to ourselves) as typical or characteristic or culture confirming in some way’ (Bruner, 2001: 35).

So while the bio is about the presentation of ourselves, we do not have complete liberty over how to paint this self-portrait. Instead we choose from a constellation of ‘possible selves’ based on what seems relevant and of interest to our colleagues and our communities to tactfully assemble an image of a ‘proper scholar’. This represents some skilful balancing acts between establishing authority and maintaining collegiality, and between displaying expertise and preserving modesty. The proclamation of affiliations and interests complicates the matter further, as declaring one’s self and allies also defines those who are in the out-group (Taylor, 1989). This perhaps helps explain why while bio is the most explicit projection of a personal persona, it is often written in an impersonal voice using the third person, presumably to avoid embarrassment caused to the writers in blowing their own trumpets and to redress the negative face of those in the out-group. In fact, as will be demonstrated by a study reported below, some linguistic repertoires are favoured over others in composing an appropriate self-portrait which is effective in socially aligning one’s qualities and interests with those valued by the discipline and in strategically positioning oneself in the face of different theoretical camps.

To sum up, the bio is an opportunity for scholars to construct a scholarly voice, promote credibility and develop a stance. This voice and stance construction differs from the ones explored in the other chapters where it is constructed towards some particular knowledge claims. Here in the academic bios, writers display a scholarly voice and take a stance at a meta-level to comment on their background, experiences and alliances, which may have led them to the positions they take towards the specific knowledge claims in the accompanied research paper. While the genre seems self-evident in that we are all entitled to make claims about ourselves, these claims are not made in a social vacuum and thus writers need to draw upon their own tact and understanding of the disciplinary expectations in the production of these texts. The analysis of academic bios, then, would give us information about how writers construct and maintain a scholarly façade, and also the ways disciplinary cultures and values have helped create these constructions while being recreated by them at the same time. I will now turn to describe a study of academic bios and the ways bio writers manipulate the available repertoires in negotiating a voice and stance to give an impression of a ‘proper academic’ in three disciplines. I begin by describing the corpus and methodology adopted.

The corpus studied here comprises 600 academic bios which accompanied research articles taken from journals in three disciplines: philosophy (Phil), applied linguistics (AL) and engineering (Eng), to broadly represent a spread of academic practice from the humanities, social sciences and applied sciences respectively. While these texts were randomly selected from journals nominated by subject specialists as representative in the respective fields, the authors of these texts were affiliated with institutions in over 40 countries and occupied a range of different positions from full professors to graduate students and research officers. This produced an electronic corpus of about 47,600 words in total.

A sample of ten texts from each subcorpus was analysed by searching for repeated patterns of the ways the writers sought to represent themselves through options at the moves and clause level of the texts, essentially identifying what writers chose to mention and how they chose to express it. These categories were further refined after transferring the texts to WinMax Pro (Kuckartz, 1998), a qualitative software program, to analyse and code all the texts in the corpus.

The coding scheme, which was based on the aspects of self writers included in their bios, embraced the following categories:

Achievements   
Community services   
Education Employment Personal data Publications Research interests

These can be seen as moves, or distinctive communicative acts which sought to project a particular aspect of the self to compose a coherent scholarly image when these individual fabrics of identity are woven together. These moves may be optional, repeated and ordered in different sequences as they represent an interplay between personal choices and disciplinary preferences. Taken together, it can be seen that writers restricted themselves in the projection of a largely academic identity in this genre.

At the clause level, I decided to examine how writers composed and positioned themselves through analysing the main verbs in the texts, or more specifically the process types, following a systemic functional linguistics (SFL) approach (Halliday, 1994). This decision was made mainly because based on intuition and initial readings of a sample of the bios, I believed that the construction of voice and stance in the genre of bio was not so much about the validation of knowledge, as I have mentioned earlier. Thus features frequently found to be related to the expression of stance in other academic genres, such as epistemic modality, evaluative adverbials and conjunctions, have a much less important role to play here. After all we are best qualified to know and to claim who we are, what we like or dislike, what our background is and so on without having to justify this knowledge. Writers were therefore not so much concerned about building an argument through epistemic devices in the bios, but more about the choice of verbs, or process types, which can help construct a self-portrait and represent experiences as precisely as desired. I therefore focused on the process types, or the ways that experience is represented in English.

In SFL, the clause can be seen as the linguistic representation of experience, allowing us to encode our understandings of our physical and imaginary worlds. These inner (the world of consciousness and imagination) and outer (the world around us) experiences are mapped onto different process types as expressed through different verbal groups. The SFL distinguishes six types of processes.

Material processes are related to ‘doing’ or happening’ and expressed through verbs concerned with action and activity in the world:

(1) She directs the Writing Skills Centre … (AL)

Mental processes are related to ‘sensing’ and expressed through verbs concerned with perception, affection and cognition:

(2) Her dissertation examined the Dhammakya temple controversy ... (Phil)

Relational processes are related to ‘being’, or the relationship between experiences. These are subdivided into three main types:

(a) Intensive: identifying: x is something (3) attributive: x is a member/type of something (4)   
(b) Circumstantial: x is at/in/on/with/about, etc. something (5)   
(c) Possessive: x has something (6)   
(3) She is the holder of 11 U.S. patents (Eng)   
(4) John Burgin is an assistant professor of Early Childhood Education …   
(AL)   
(5) Her current research is on religious toys and games… (Phil)   
(6) Guido Dedene has a Ph.D. in Sciences (Mathematics) (Eng)

These three major processes are bridged by existential, verbal and behavioural processes, which refer respectively to the experience of ‘existing’, ‘saying’ and ‘behaving’ as illustrated in examples (7), (8) and (9):

(7) Between them there is The Claim of Reason in 1979, along with books devoted to Thoreau, Emerson, Shakespeare, and cinema. (Phil)   
(8) He presented numerous invited talks at national and international meetings. (Eng)   
(9) Social Criticism, which commemorated the work of Foucault … (Phil)

In the following sections, I discuss the findings of the study, looking briefly first into the overall frequency patterns. These will be followed by more focused discussion of disciplinary variations in the aspects of self that academics chose to include in their bios and the process types employed in their realizations.

# Overall frequency patterns

While bios do not occur in every single journal, they are a ubiquitous part of academic publishing. Many journals insist on a bio of each author upon the submission of an accepted paper and some provide guidelines such as these:

(10) Each contributor should provide a brief biodata of about 90 words listing main interests, recent publications, and a contact address. Email address is optional. (Applied Linguistics)   
Vitae. Include a short (maximum 50 words) biography of each author. (Assessing Writing)   
A biographical note of no more than 50 words should be included. ( Journal of Moral Philosophy)   
Include in the manuscript a short (maximum 100 words) biography of each author, along with a passport-type photograph accompanying the other figures. (Computers and Electronic Engineering)

As can be seen from the above notes to authors, house style varies both in terms of the expected length and content of the bios. The idea of ‘short’, in particular, differs, with a journal in applied linguistics defining it as ‘maximum 50 words’ and engineering as double of that. It can be observed from Table 5.1, which shows the word counts for each disciplinary corpus of 200 bios, that word length was indeed a distinguishing feature of bios across disciplines, with those in engineering about twice as long as those in applied linguistics.

The reason for such a large variation in word length is unclear, but it may be related to the far more common practice of multiple authorship in hard fields like engineering where individuality is suppressed by the need for a consistently impersonal style in the paper proper and only reclaimed in the attached bios.

Table 5.1 Corpus length by discipline   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Philosophy</td><td>Applied linguistics</td><td>Engineering</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>No. of words.</td><td>13,299</td><td>11,641</td><td>22,657</td><td>47,597</td></tr></table></body></html>

The frequency data also reveal something of the ways that academics represent themselves in the bios. Table 5.2 shows the raw and normed figures for both moves and process types. As can be seen, there were 1853 moves in the corpus in total, giving an average of three moves per bio, or about 40 moves every 1000 words. Employment and research represented the most frequent moves, and together made up over half of all move types in the corpus. Employment histories and research interests are available to everyone and are arguably most efficient in positioning academics in the community by stating their physical attachment and therefore that of scholarly philosophy to a particular institution and by announcing their theoretical affiliation with a particular school of thoughts or field of research. A related aspect of this kind of positioning is education background, which ranked third in all the move types.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, writers were not as ready to include statements of their personal profile in an academic context, although these instances were not absent. The remaining facets of life represent a more extensive range of scholarly involvements which are perhaps more applicable to the relatively experienced academics and thus occurred less frequently in a corpus which comprised texts written by writers of a range of status and experience.

In terms of representing these experiences, bio writers rely heavily on the relational and material processes, which together made up more than 95 per cent of all the process types. The dominance of these process types highlights the importance of what individuals claimed to be and what they do. Most of the relational processes were of the intensive types, where a writer claims to be something, such as an assistant professor or a recipient of a certain grant. The possessive types were also fairly common, and were mainly concerned with the kind of experience or background that writers claimed to have. Circumstantial processes, where the process includes an attribute of some kind, such as what the writer is interested in or an institution he or she is affiliated with, were observed far less frequently. One would, however, expect more instances of mental and verbal processes in the academic context as scholars often engaged in activities which require thinking and speaking. Their few occurrences may therefore suggest their assumed roles to be in the background while writers chose to feature more on other exceptional qualities and experiences in this limited space.

In the next section, I turn to the disciplinary patterns of these moves and processes, beginning with moves.

# Disciplinary variations in move types

The picture described in the previous section is more varied when the bios are divided into the three discipline groups. As can be seen from Table 5.3, employment is a dominant move in this genre for the philosophers and applied linguists and made up the largest proportion of the moves they used. Bios in these two fields very often start with a statement of the writers’ current, and often past, institutional affiliations:

(11) Angelica Nuzzo is associate professor of philosophy at Brooklyn College, City University of New York, and in 2000 and 2001 was a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies at Harvard. She is the author of … (Phil)   
David Taub is a lecturer of Barllan University. His fields of professional specialization are …. (AL)

Table 5.3 Moves by disciplines (per 1000 words)   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Phil</td><td>AL</td><td>Eng</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Employment</td><td>14.8</td><td>16.5</td><td>8.3</td><td>12.1</td></tr><tr><td>Research</td><td>8.6</td><td>13.1</td><td>9.2</td><td>10.0</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>3.9</td><td>5.2</td><td>8.1</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>Publications</td><td>11.9</td><td>6.7</td><td>2.1</td><td>5.9</td></tr><tr><td>Achievements</td><td>0.6</td><td>1.5</td><td>2.8</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Community services</td><td>1.4</td><td>1.1</td><td>2.3</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Personal profile</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.6</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>42.0</td><td>44.6</td><td>34.2</td><td>38.9</td></tr></table></body></html>

In fact, it seems obligatory for these writers to locate themselves firmly in the academic milieu through association with a particular institution, for in cases where they were reluctant to disclose much about themselves, employment details served as the one representative move which comprised the entire bio:

(12) Lisbeth Mikaelsson is professor of the History of Religions at the University of Bergen, Norway. (Phil)

John Burgin is an assistant professor of Early Childhood Education at the Unviersity of Arkansas at Little Rock. Previous to his tenure at UALR, he was a reading specialist, a Kindergarten teacher, and a reading recovery teacher in the public schools for 20 years. (AL)

The engineers used only half as many statements of work position as the other two fields, and showed some other interesting variations as well. For engineers, education background, which did not play a prominent role in the other two fields, seemed to be a significant aspect of their academic identity and was described in great detail:

(13) P.S. Sathidevi received B. Tech Degree in Electronics Engineering from Regional Engineering College, Calicut (Calicut University) in 1985, M.Tech Degree in Electronics from Cochin University of Science and Technology, Cochin in 1987 and Ph.D. from Regional Engineering College Calicut (Calicut University) in 2003 in the field of Speech and Audio Processing. (Eng)

While the more developed tradition of learned societies which often have a fully established membership hierarchy may have encouraged such a chronological recount of one’s history in attaining professional qualifications, this emphasis on educational background also reflects a more apprenticeship-based system of research training in the hard sciences where novices enjoy greater opportunities of collaboration in research and publication as members of a lab-based team even while they are pursuing their studies. In engineering fields, for example, the focus of a student project is liable to be part of a wider collaboratively conducted study and so more likely to warrant early publishing and carry on to be an engineer’s academic pursuit. Thus for many engineers educational training is a significant aspect of their career profile and tends to be given more space in their bios than in applied linguistics and philosophy.

The most important element on an engineer’s façade, however, was their area of research expertise and interest which constituted the largest proportion of move types in the engineering bios. As an applied hard field (Becher and Trowler, 2001), engineering puts prior emphasis on research and investigations often have an orientation towards practical applications and seek partnership with other business and social organizations beyond academia:

(14) Patrick has been collaborating with Boeing Phantom Works (Seattle, USA), Bell Canada, and Southeast University (Nanjing, China) on several research projects. Recently he is working on a mobile healthcare project with the Hong Kong Red Cross with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. (Eng)

While such inquiries can potentially lead to significant advancement for society and recognition of personal achievement, it is little surprise that almost all engineers invested in this aspect of their identity in their bios. This emphasis on practical contributions of research is also reflected in the more frequent and varied achievement moves in the engineering corpus. In applied linguistics and philosophy, accomplishment often concerned winning awards and scholarships, or the successful foundation of a respectable journal or association (15). In addition to these achievements, those in engineering may also cover direct rewards of excellence in research which go further than recognition within the academic context, such as ownership of patents, elevation of status, and the establishment of commercial companies as in (16).

(15) His biography of Vivekananda was selected by Choice as an Outstanding Academic Book in Religion in 1997. (Phil)   
Beside various other prizes, she was lately awarded the Wittgenstein-Prize for Elite Researchers (1996). (AL)   
With John Daly in 1983, he founded Written Communication: An International Quarterly of Research, Theory, and Application, … (AL) (16) She is the holder of 11 U.S. patents. (Eng)   
Dr. Ozturk was the recipient of the NSF Presidential Faculty Fellowship in 1995. He was elevated to the IEEE Fellow status for his contributions to $S i$ and Si xGex epitaxy (Eng)   
Before founding Nanohmics, he was a founder and the Chief Technical Officer with Extreme Devices, Inc. ... (Eng)

Similarly, the writer’s research interests also figure prominently in applied linguistics, ranking as the second most frequent move type in their bios:

(17) His research focuses on discourse structure and coherence, from a linguistic and a psycholinguistic perspective. (AL) Her specialization is language testing and classroom assessment. (AL)

These declarations of research interests served to demarcate a particular specialism that the writer has taken on and to signal membership and collegiality by aligning the writers with a particular theoretical camp of like-minded individuals. This alliance with fellow scholars through an announcement of areas of investigation seemed less fashionable than parading list of publications in philosophy. Mentions of publications occurred twice and six times more frequently in philosophical bios than those in applied linguistics and engineering respectively.

Unlike the hard sciences where publication usually takes the form of expedited and multiply authored journal articles, publications in philosophy are often in the form of single-authored monographs or elaborate prose. This therefore provides a greater chance for the demonstration of individual wit and personal insights. The philosophers were indeed generous in the space they gave to showcase their work in the bios, and detailed descriptions like these were fairly common:

(18) Her book, Singing to the Jinas: Jain Laywomen, Maa Singing and the Negotiations of Jain Devotion (OUP, 2001) analyzes Jain hymns and hymn-singing in the context of Jain laywomen’s devotional practices. She has completed a second book-length project, currently entitled ‘Heroic Wives,’ (OUP, Forthcoming), which analyzes sati discourse, Jain narratives of wifely virtue, and contemporary Jain conceptions of wife-hood. (Phil)

His most recent book is Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (Cambridge University Press, 2008). Other authored books include Surface and Depth (Cornell University Press, 2002), Performing Live (Cornell University Press, 2000), Practicing Philosophy (Routledge, 1997), and Pragmatist Aesthetics (Rowman and Littlefield, 1992, 2000, and translated into twelve languages). He edited Analytic Aesthetics (Blackwell, 1989) and The Range of Pragmatism and the Limits of Philosophy (Wiley-Blackwell, 2004), and coedited Aesthetic Experience (Routledge, 2008). (Phil)

In the next section, I discuss how these moves were realized through the process types writers chose to use in the three disciplines.

# Disciplinary variations in process types

In discussing Table 5.2, I noted that relational and material processes prevailed in the present corpus of bios. This pattern seems to remain true in the three discipline groups, especially with material processes spread roughly equally across the fields. However, there are several interesting differences among the groups as well.

As can be observed from Table 5.4, the most striking difference among the three disciplines lies in the subcategories of relational processes, with the identifying type figuring exceedingly more frequently in the philosophy corpus and the attributive type standing out in applied linguistics. According to Halliday (1994), relational processes encode relationships of being and having between two entities. The identifying type in the philosophical bios studied here typically served to identify the writer as a particular individual in terms of their status and institutional affiliation (19) and publications (20):

(19) Jeanne Openshaw is Senior Lecturer in Religious Studies at the University of Edinburgh. (Phil)   
(20) He is the author of What is Analytic Philosophy? (2007), Quine and Davidson on Language, Thought and Reality (2003), and Does Ontology Exist? (Philosophy 77, 2002). (Phil)

Table 5.4 Process types by disciplines (per 1000 words)   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Phil</td><td>AL</td><td>Eng</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Relational</td><td>32.6</td><td>30.8</td><td>23.7</td><td>27.9</td></tr><tr><td>Identifying</td><td>18.7</td><td>9.2</td><td>5.4</td><td>10.1</td></tr><tr><td>Attributive</td><td>4.6</td><td>10.6</td><td>8.5</td><td>7.9</td></tr><tr><td>Possessive</td><td>6.9</td><td>8.8</td><td>7.5</td><td>7.7</td></tr><tr><td>Circumstantial</td><td>2.4</td><td>2.3</td><td>3.5</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>Material</td><td>22</td><td>23.6</td><td>23.6</td><td>23.2</td></tr><tr><td>Mental</td><td>1.4</td><td>2.1</td><td>0.7</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Verbal</td><td>0.7</td><td>1.1</td><td>1.4</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Behavioural</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Existential</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>56.8</td><td>57.7</td><td>49.4</td><td>53.5</td></tr></table></body></html>

These preferences perhaps reflect the more individualistic ethos in philosophy where knowledge is personally owned and the display of a competent, independent and idiosyncratic self is promoted.

The applied linguists, in contrast, construed themselves as individual members of a group who shared some similar status and knowledge through attributive processes (21) and a valued insider who had recognized skills and experiences to contribute to the field with the use of possessive processes (22):

(21) Lia Plakans is an assistant professor in Foreign Language Education at the University of Texas at Austin. (AL)   
Laura Méndez is an associate professor of Developmental Psychology and Education at the Spanish UNED. (AL)   
(22) He also has extensive experience in curriculum and program evaluation. (AL)   
He holds a PhD in Sociolinguistics from the University of Southern Denmark. (AL)

Another interesting variation is the greater use of mental processes in applied linguistics and philosophy which underlies the tendency for research to be an act of cognitive exploration rather than of experiments in the labs:

(23) Her research investigates also studies in public and private discourse in Austria. (AL)   
Her second book will explore international fairness in relation to practices of collective justification that regulate … (Phil)   
His books explore the birth of tragedy, the role of aesthetics in Greek Culture … (Phil)

Engineers, on the other hand, favoured the use of verbal processes, highlighting their scholarly role in the dissimilation of knowledge through presentation in lectures and conferences:

(24) She is now lecturing at Sanjesh College of Computing and Statistics, Tehran, Iran. (Eng)   
He presented numerous invited talks at national and international meetings. (Eng)

# Conclusion

Scholarly credibility is predominantly recognized through concerted effort in research publication, teaching and professional development. While these activities are often presented and evaluated as events independent of their agency, the academic bio encourages scholars to take responsibility and credit for these endeavours in constructing an image of a ‘proper scholar’ valued by their disciplinary community. We have seen that a majority of bio writers do take this opportunity to strategically position themselves in the community through showcasing their research expertise and publications, displaying theoretical alliances and collegiality, as well as emphasizing contribution and services. As such, the bio is essentially a form of stance-taking at the meta-level. We have seen that, for example, writers are able to manipulate this space to align themselves with the beliefs and values upheld by their fellow colleagues and disciplines. In particular, the philosophers emphasize idiosyncrasy, featuring their individual contribution through their often single-authored publications. Applied linguists, on the other hand, seek alliance with different research interest groups, constructing expertise and experience as collaborative effort in contributing to the field. Finally, engineers highlight the succession and utilization of knowledge, putting emphasis on individuals’ specialist training and the reconciliation of academic research and practical application.

The analyses once again show how peripheral genres, such as acknowledgements (Hyland and Tse, 2004), book blurbs (Gesuato, 2007) and the bios examined here, work as part of the entire genre constellation (Swales, 2004) to support a coherent academic stance and a credible scholarly image, and to invoke/promote relevant values, beliefs and conventions of a discipline. Through exploring a corpus of academic bios from three disciplines, this chapter attempted to characterize the genre as an expression of stance and voice through examining the aspects of self that writers chose to include and the process types used to describe them. It also represents an attempt to contribute to our understanding of the network of academic genres, highlighting the insights obtained from an examination of a seemingly peripheral genre. I have only scratched the surface here and there are still many dimensions that future research can explore. These include the influence of various socio-economic factors, such as gender, culture and academic status, towards the choice of aspects and process types, as well as the writing practices of individual writers.

# 6 Hedging, Stance and Voice in Medical Research Articles

Alan G. Gross and Paula Chesley1 University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and University of Alberta

# 1 Introduction: what does it mean to be a scientist?

As a scientist employed by an industry, you would have a vested interest in the sale of its products. You might hope that consumers would benefit, but profit would be uppermost on your mind. If you were a researcher at a medical center, you might hope to profit from what you discovered: to take out a patent on a medical device or a mutant bacterium. Nevertheless, you would need to impress on your fellow researchers that uppermost on your mind was not profit, but the advance of knowledge. To communicate this mandatory attitude toward your work – this stance – your prose would adopt a characteristic voice, a particular pattern of syntactic and lexical semantic choices. For example, Everett et al. (2010) present positive findings for rosuvastatin, a drug designed to lower cholesterol but tested to prevent stroke in their JUPITER trial. These authors’ claims, however, are mitigated by a serious limitation – a meta-analysis showed that their findings in favor of rosuvastatin for stroke prevention did not differ significantly from the use of other statins. Given these results, these authors exhibit the tentativeness of their findings while maintaining face with statements such as (1):

(1) Given the net benefit of statin therapy observed in our updated meta-analysis, it is possible that any apparent differences between JUPITER and each of the prior trials may simply reflect the play of chance.

Their stance is caution itself, the desire to embody in their prose the organized skepticism the scientific community so values. This objectivity manifests itself in a pattern exhibited in their prose: the hedges possible and may. This is an aspect of voice.

# 2 Stance, voice, rhetoric, and medicine

The origin of stance and voice as objects of scholarly inquiry is in Aristotle’s Rhetoric (2007). In this work, e-thos, the fons et origo of stance, is one of three means through which the voice of speakers can be persuasive; the others are logos and pathos. Audiences can be persuaded either by their trust in the character of the speaker (e - thos), the arguments the speaker makes (logos), or the emotional bonds speakers are able to forge with audiences ( pathos). The three means of persuasion are not, however, equally efficacious. It is e- thos that is primary if persuasion is to succeed. In Aristotle’s words:

[there is persuasion] through character whenever the speech is spoken in such a way as to make the speaker worthy of credence; for we believe fair-minded people to a greater extent and more quickly [than we do others], on all subjects in general and completely so in cases where there is not exact knowledge but room for doubt. And this should result from the speech, not from a previous opinion that the speaker is a certain kind of person; for it is not the case, as some of the handbook writers propose in their treatment of the art, that fair-mindedness on the part of the speaker makes no contribution to persuasiveness; rather, character is, so to speak, the most authoritative form of persuasion. (pp. 38–9)

For Aristotle, e- thos is the equivalent of stance, a stance completely embodied in a speaker’s voice, since for Aristotle anything external to the speech does not count. The three components of e- thos are phronesis, arete- , and eunoia. Phronesis is practical wisdom, the ability of lawyers to amass the best arguments in favor of a client, or of legislators to convince their fellows that a course of action is in their best interest and the best interest of the state. The aretai are usually translated as virtues; they include such strengths of character as courage and generosity. Finally, speakers must exhibit eunoia; they must demonstrate to audiences that they have their best interests in mind.

Because Aristotle was writing only about speech in public spaces – the legislative assembly, the law courts, public occasions of celebration and commemoration – we cannot without modification adopt his analysis to the linguistic practices of medical researchers. To adopt the stance and voice of the classical orator in our analysis, we must adapt it so that it conforms to a new social context, contemporary medicine. For Aristotle, medicine was an art; phronesis, or practical wisdom, guided the physician’s hand. For us, medicine is both an art and a science; the physician’s hand is guided by expert knowledge as well as phronesis. But expert knowledge alone does not suffice. Some form of the Hippocratic oath creates eunoia: it guarantees that physicians will practice medicine always in the interest of their patients. The aretai are also involved: to further the advance of scientific knowledge, a set of norms has evolved against which the conduct of physicians and medical researchers can be measured, strengths of character specific to a professional community.

The sociologist Robert Merton has identified four aretai or social norms essential to the proper conduct of science: communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, and organized skepticism (CUDOS; Merton, 1968). To this list, we would add originality. To be communal is freely to share our results with others, reserving only public credit for our discoveries. To subscribe to universalism is to assert that anyone following our methods will arrive at our results. To be disinterested is never to confuse our personal goals with the goal of our science, the discovery of medical truth. To manifest organized skepticism is to make doubt a methodological principle, one applied equally to our results and the results of others. To be original is never to repeat what is known except in pursuit of what is to be discovered. These aretai or norms are not meant to describe the ways scientists behave; rather, they are meant to describe the way scientists feel they should behave.

These norms are Aristotelian means. Communalism is the mean between hoarding our results and declaring no ownership rights to them. Universalism is the mean between dogmatism and methodological laxity. Disinterestedness is the mean between not caring and caring too much. Organized skepticism is the mean between dismissing all claims to knowledge and accepting any claim authority purports to be true. Originality is the mean between repeating settled views and indulging in idle speculation. These norms form a code of professional conduct. To heed this code in one’s work is to express the proper stance toward it; to express this code in medical research articles is to project the proper professional voice to one’s chosen audience. Heeding this code also exhibits phronesis, a deep understanding concerning the degree of confidence claims to knowledge deserve, and eunoia, an abiding concern for the needs of one’s audience, a bond of common interest in the advance of medical science. Hedges are one way of manifesting these norms in one’s prose, one way to persuade. For instance, one criticism of the Everett et al. JUPITER study (2010) might be that, after examination of the meta-analysis, their findings simply reflect the play of chance. However, their use of hedging in (1) preempts this criticism by fine-tuning the argument to the available evidence.

To heed these norms is to legitimate one’s membership in a scientific community; to deviate from them is to deny that membership, to be subject to community sanctions. Nevertheless, obedience to these norms does not determine status in the community, scientists’ share in the communal rewards their fellows can offer. These rewards range from successful grant proposals to the Nobel Prize. The amount of this share is a consequence of the significance of a scientist’s work, its impact on their community. Scientists can and do attain status without deviating from the code. But they can and do attain it also by bending or breaking its rules. According to Merton’s theory of deviance, the incentive to follow these rules can weaken or disappear when ‘a rough balance’ between emphases on cultural goals and institutionalized practices’ is upset: ‘the distribution of statuses through competition must be so organized that positive incentives for adherence to status obligations are provided for every position within the distributive order. Otherwise, … aberrant behavior ensues’ (188; emphasis his). A state of anomie or ‘normlessness’ supervenes. As defined by Merton, anomic behavior can exist at two levels, that of the individual scientist and of whole communities:

a mounting frequency of deviant but ‘successful’ behavior tends to lessen and, as an extreme potentiality, to eliminate the legitimacy of the institutional norms for others in the system. The process thus enlarges the extent of anomie within the system so that others, who did not respond in the form of deviant behavior to the very slight anomie which first obtained, come to do so as anomie spreads and is intensified. This, in turn, creates a more acutely anomic situation for still other and initially less vulnerable individuals in the social system. In this way, anomie and mounting rates of deviant behavior can be conceived as interacting in a process of social and cultural dynamics with cumulatively disruptive consequences for the normative structure. (234)

The spread of deviance in the scientific community can be likened to the spread of a disease like influenza. Initially, an outbreak affects a relatively small group of particularly vulnerable scientists. If preventive measures are not taken, the outbreak can become an epidemic, affecting the entire biomedical community, or, worse, a pandemic that can spread to other disciplines, touching the scientific community as a whole.

# 3 Stance and voice in the biomedical community

Merton’s half-century-old analysis of the development of deviance applies to the biomedical community of today, to their attempts to persuade that violate the social norms of science. Retraction Watch, a blog run by science journalists, documents current deviant behavior on the part of members of that community: repeated instances of fraud, inexcusable carelessness, and plagiarism. In the biomedical literature, moreover, the norms of communality, universalism, disinterestedness, and organized skepticism are routinely violated. Recommendations and conclusions are not supported by data (Boutron et al., 2010; Jefferson et al., 2009; Hewitt et al., 2008) or are exaggerated (Gøtszche, 2006). Conclusions are biased by financial ties to sponsoring pharmaceutical companies (Yank et al., 2007; Jørgensen et al., 2006; Jefferson et al., 2009; Bennett et al., 2010), as are clinical trials (Elliott, 2010). In addition, there is a lack of transparency. Protocols are not presented, and the reporting of crucial methodological concerns such as sample-size calculations are not mandatory (Jørgensen et al., 2006; Hopewell et al., 2010: 5). Industry-supported studies in medical journals are also more likely to report positive findings, regardless of the evidence, and to support new and off-label treatments over standard ones (‘Drug Information Data Base’: 15–16). Despite the heavy involvement of industry in funding research, only 26 percent of North American medical journals required disclosure of any conflict of interest that might arise from drug company subsidies (‘Drug Information Data Base’: 16). Finally, the mere disclosure of funding sources that present a possible conflict of interest may not significantly influence physician behavior in the prescription of new drugs (Silverman et al., 2010).

Why has the erosion of these norms in the biomedical community become so pronounced and pervasive? Sztompka (2007) feels that the answer lies in four developments: fiscalization, privatization, commodification, and bureaucratization. Fiscalization, the growing need for large sums of money to carry out elaborate research programs, has meant that funding agencies have imposed their own priorities, a trend that undermines the Mertonian norm of universalism. Privatization, the growing sense among biomedical scientists that knowledge is proprietary, undermines the norm of communalism, secrecy trumping transparency. Commodification, the degree to which biomedicine creates products subject to market forces, undermines the norms of disinterestedness and organized skepticism. Finally, bureaucratization, with its substitution of external for peer evaluation, undermines organized skepticism because bureaucratic priorities routinely trump those of medical science.

How is it possible for deviant behavior in the biomedical community to persist despite mounting evidence that confirms its pervasiveness? Habermas’s theory of systematically distorted communication explains this persistence. According to this theory, communication can derail in two ways: through manipulation and through systematically distorted communication. Manipulation is about deception; systematically distorted communication, about self-deception (Habermas, 1982: 264). In manipulation, a border is crossed. Communicative action becomes strategic: its goal is no longer mutual understanding, but an end deliberately hidden from one of the interlocutors. In systematically distorted communication, a border has also been crossed. Interlocutors deceive themselves; they think they are in control of exchanges whose purpose is mutual understanding. In fact, they have ceded control to special interests. When this occurs, the result is self-deception, a state in which language disguises deviance as conformity to accepted norms (Gross, 2010).

# 4 Hedging as an expression of stance and voice in the biomedical community: an empirical study

Hedging, the use of linguistic indicators to show the degree of commitment to claims, is one marker of stance, one expression of voice. Hedging tracks all of Merton’s norms. In communication in accord with these norms, no systematic relationship will exist between the degree of hedging and the source of funding. In our sample of 308 biomedical articles, the product of a scientific community in which deviance is rife, we hypothesized that this null hypothesis would not hold. Specifically, we hypothesized that studies with overt industry funding would be more likely to report their results in a way that encourages readers to give more credence to their claims than their evidential base permits. In other words, fewer hedges will be employed in medical research articles with industrial funding. Were this true, it would have an important clinical implication: more convincing language could lead practitioners to change their habits in favor of pro-industry treatments or solutions; it could also lead to unintentional biases on the part of science journalists.

# 4.1 Method

To test this hypothesis, we examined hedging patterns in the ALIBI corpus (Puhan et al., 2009). This corpus of 308 biomedical research articles spans 29 general and specialized medical journals with impact factors ranging from 2.85 to 47.05. To ensure balance, there is a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 19 articles per journal, with a mean of 10.62. Articles date from 2007 or 2010. The number of articles by journal is given in Appendix A. To determine hedging patterns, we used an automatic program (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008), graciously provided by Halil Kilicoglu, which determines a ‘hedging score’ for each sentence in a text. Hedges such as modal verbs (may, could), adverbs (apparently, pos sibly) and lexical verbs (suggest [that], believe [that]) are detected, and each hedge is given a score. The hedging score of a sentence is the sum of its individual hedging scores. This method has an accuracy of 93 percent, which means 93 percent of all hedging classifications consist of either true positives or true negatives as opposed to false positives or false negatives. As we were interested in hedging throughout an entire document, we summed all hedging scores for all sentences. This aggregation method has proved successful in previous research (Chesley et al., 2006). The hedging score so obtained was then normalized: we divided it by the number of words in the article. In the analysis presented below, the normalized hedging score, henceforth simply ‘hedging score’, is our response variable.

Our hypothesis is that greater involvement of for-profit entities will correlate with a decrease in hedging, as indicated by the article’s hedging score. As it turns out, industry sponsorship is extremely difficult to gauge. Some journals in our corpus, such as the British Medical Journal, require a disclosure statement about potential conflicts of interest. The BMJ requires the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ Unified Competing Interest form, but other journals such as Circulation require their own statement. Still others, such as the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, require no conflict of interest statement. Some statements are given in the articles themselves; others have references to online statements of conflict of interest.

Furthermore, industry involvement can be of several types. Those in our corpus are given below:

1. Full industry sponsorship of the research.   
2. Authorship by industry employees.   
3. Industry donation of materials or lab space.   
4. Industry payment for statistician-consultants.

5. Industry payment for administrative costs.   
6. Industry payment for data collection.   
7. Industry reviewing of a manuscript prior to submission.   
8. Conflict of interest between authors’ family members and industry sponsors.   
9. Honoraria or other expenses to authors.   
10. Author membership on industry boards.   
11. Industry grant support to authors.   
12. Industry stock options to authors.   
13. Consulting, lecture, or speaking fees to authors.   
14. Authors listed as inventors on industry patents (not necessarily for the study reported).

To be as conservative as possible in what is considered industry sponsorship, we included only the first seven items from this list. The first seven had a clear relationship to the research reported, while items 8–14 were of a more general nature and could not be linked to that research. Generally, our criterion in determining industry sponsorship was whether the involvement was for the specific research being presented, and not for past research, other possible research, or nonspecific industry involvement. In general, because many of the first seven items co-occurred, the presence of industry sponsorship was abundantly clear. In total, 65 of our corpus articles met these conservative sponsorship criteria. To keep matters simple, industry sponsorship was considered a binary variable; we recognized no degrees of sponsorship.

At least two other factors could influence the amount of hedging in medical research articles: the impact factor and the nature of the study. Perhaps journals with larger impact factors attract research reporting stronger claims. If this were so, a journal’s impact factor would be negatively associated with an article’s amount of hedging. The type of study could also influence the amount of hedging. In evidence-based medicine, a confidence level is assigned to each study type. Level I, the ‘gold standard’ of evidence-based medicine, consists only of randomized control trials (RCTs). In an RCT, participants are randomly assigned to the treatment or control group, after which follow-up procedures are identical for both groups. Given the privileged status of RCTs in evidence-based medicine, we might expect stronger claims, and correspondingly less hedging, in these studies. To test this hypothesis, we have divided the articles in our sample into RCT studies (58) and other study types (250).

# 4.2 Results

With hedging score as our response variable, we conducted a multiple linear regression using the following predictor variables (also known as independent variables): (1) industry sponsorship (yes/no), (2) journal impact factor, and (3) study type (RCT/non-RCT). We have assumed no interaction between these predictors, and to date we have not tested for significant interactions or higher-order terms such as quadratics. As hypothesized, there is a decreased amount of hedging in articles with clear industry sponsorship. This effect was highly significant $\left( \mathrm { X } \ ( 1 ) \right. = \ 1 2 . 3 7 .$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p < 0 . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ ). In the model including both journal impact factor and study type, both were marginally significant in the directions expected $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { X } \left( 1 \right) ) =$ 3.32, $p = 0 . 0 7 ,$ ) and $( \mathrm { X } ~ ( 1 ) = 3 . 7 1$ , $p = 0 . 0 5 5$ ), respectively. A higher journal impact factor led to lower amounts of hedging, and RCTs had fewer hedges than non-RCT studies. However, when each of these two predictors was removed from the model, the effect for the other became significant at $p < 0 . 0 5$ . The two factors are somewhat correlated $( r _ { \mathrm { s } } = 0 . 1 9 2 )$ , but not so much as to lead to spurious results in a linear model. Still, impact factor may well be significant at $p < 0 . 0 5$ : its marginal significance in this sample may be the result of the low- to mid-range impact factors of the majority of articles. Relatively few articles appear in journals with impact factors $> 2 0$ (only 35 out of 308 in our corpus).

To determine whether all three predictor variables were necessary, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1974). From the highly significant chi-squared statistic above, determining whether to keep industry sponsorship in the model was not an issue. Rather, we used the AIC to choose between a three-predictor model and a twopredictor model. The model with only sponsorship and impact factor had an AIC of $- 1 7 9 6 . 9$ , and the model with only sponsorship and study type had an AIC of −1797.2. The model with three predictors (industry sponsorship, journal impact factor, and study type) had the lowest AIC at −1798.6. Thus we conclude that there is some support for a threepredictor model. In what follows, we report information for this model. These results are visualized in the partial-effects plots of Figure 6.1. Figure 6.1 plots an effect for a given predictor on the response variable, hedging score. As is apparent, the most dramatic effect exists for industry sponsorship.

The specifics of the linear model are given in Table 6.1. Estimates represent the beta-value for each predictor. The reference levels for the binary variables of study type and industry sponsorship are, respectively, non-RCT and no industry sponsorship. The values in Table 6.1 represent the change in the response variable when study type becomes

RCT and when there is industry sponsorship. All predictors have negative values. This means that the amount of hedging decreases for RCTs, as journal impact factor increases. It also decreases with industry sponsorship. The multiple $R ^ { 2 }$ value of this model is a modest 0.10, but it is still a significant improvement over the baseline model $( F ( 3 , 3 0 4 ) =$ 11.26, $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) for determining hedging scores.

Articles with industry sponsorship have a predicted hedging score of about 0.03, and the corresponding figure for articles without industry sponsorship is approximately 0.038 (see Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1). An article’s hedging score is not an easily interpretable scale, so we illustrate the differences in language between these hedging scores with an analysis of the final paragraphs of two articles, an industry-sponsored article with a hedging score of about 0.03 and a non-industry-sponsored article with a score of about 0.037. The first article, by Laine et al. (in Lancet, 2007), has a hedging score of 0.02999, and is a randomized control trial. It also involves industry sponsorship from Merck: a Merck employee coauthored the paper, and the product tested is etoricoxib, which Merck manufactures under the brand name Arcoxia. This study claims that a treatment with etoricoxib resulted in fewer gastrointestinal clinical events such as bleeding or ulcers than did the traditional treatment. The last paragraph of this paper, given in (2), sums up the findings nicely. We italicize relevant claims and limitations:

(2) In patients taking PPIs, use of the COX-2 selective inhibitor etoricoxib reduced the risk of upper gastrointestinal clinical events and dyspepsia as compared with the traditional NSAID diclofenac. Similarly, in patients taking low-dose aspirin regularly, the risk of upper gastrointestinal clinical events and dyspepsia was reduced with the use of etoricoxib. However, the reductions in risk of these clinical events were seen only in the more common, but less serious uncomplicated events.

The paper ends there. Two claims are made about reductions in risk as a result of taking etoricoxib, neither of which is hedged. One limitation is expressed: these reductions occur only for less serious clinical events. Yet this limitation does not affect the strength of the previous unhedged claims. The Kilicoglu and Bergler program confirms this impression: it does not identify any hedges in this passage.

In contrast, Hwang et al. (in Obstetrics and Gynecology, 2007) has a hedging score of 0.0371, which indicates a higher amount of hedging than in Laine et al. The study was supported by the Department of Defense, was not an RCT, and examines the relationship between diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in two conditions: upon entering army training and on vacation from training. The beginning of the last paragraph (3) summarizes the findings and offers suggestions for future courses of action. Again, we italicize relevant claims:

(3) Overall, our findings suggest that the standard-of-care approach of universal STI screening followed by one brief treatment and counseling session of STI positive women does not have a sufficient desired dampening effect on subsequent risky sexual behaviors. As universal screening programs are increasingly implemented to identify and treat STIs, a next step toward control of STIs may be the development of services to specifically decrease risk behaviors after successful screening and treatment.

These authors hedge their claims with the lexical verb suggest that and the modal verb may, both of which are picked up by the Kilicoglu and Bergler hedging algorithm. Interestingly, these authors do not shy away from a generalization from their findings, which they do with the hedge suggest that and the present tense in the complement clause. In contrast, Laine et al., with sponsoring from Merck, never stray from their results. Generalizations about implications of reported findings such as Hwang et al.’s require some hedging. On the other hand, because Laine et al. limit their discussion to their results, firmly in the past, their conclusion requires no hedging. They let the reader draw the obvious conclusion from their positive findings (fewer gastrointestinal clinical events) and the clinical consequences of those findings (use etoricoxib).

# 5 Discussion and conclusion

In this chapter we have examined the origins of stance and voice in Aristotle’s Rhetoric and adapted this analysis to the biomedical community, where industry support is prevalent. To do so, we have used Robert Merton’s sociological work on norms and deviance in scientific communities and proposed to measure deviance as a systematically decreased amount of hedging in industry-sponsored research. The results from our corpus support our hypothesis; they suggest that the language used to report findings in the biomedical research community varies according to degree of involvement from industry sponsors. This effect persists when possible confounds such as study type (randomized control trial or not) and journal impact factor are taken into account. Such deviance persists in biomedical research due to self-deception: a significant number of industry-supported researchers are eager to see the benefits of their findings at the expense of examining possible negative implications their work entails.

We see three implications of this study. The first concerns explanatory contexts. While it is useful to discuss the epistemic and interpersonal functions of hedging in scientific research articles (Hyland, 1998) and in medical articles (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Skelton, 1997), it is equally important, we think, to explore their rhetorical function and their role in the larger social context in which they operate. Rhetorically, hedges are a component of the voice of science, a voice designed to persuade an audience of professional scientists by convincing them that what is said is objective truth. It is a voice that persuades so well because it is generated by a set of social norms for scientific conduct. Like all norms, these are subject to deviance, a deviance that the aberrant patterns of hedging successfully track. But it is not enough to track this linguistic deviance; it is also necessary to explain it, to connect it to larger social forces. This is the job that Merton’s theory of deviance performs. Finally, we must account for the persistence of deviance, the objective of Habermas’s theory of systematically distorted communication. Our approach is not limited to the study of hedging in medical research articles; we think it has wider implications for applied linguistics.

The second implication of our study endorses the utility of Kilicoglu and Bergler’s (2008) software program for the investigation of hedging. We have focused on the identification of hedges in medical articles with and without industry sponsorship. But other applications are clearly worth exploring not only in science but also in other areas. Are there differences in hedging among the sciences? Are there differences between primary and popular science? How do the op-ed pages of newspapers compare with straight news stories? Such research questions are addressed in Myers (1994) and Hyland (1998, 2000).

There is a third implication. We believe that a statistical approach to determining hedging patterns reveals subtle but important regularities across biomedical research articles, and it is our hope that these regularities motivate improvement in transparency within the biomedical research community. To readers, an industry-sponsored article and one not so sponsored look exactly alike, at least if judged by physicians’ similar evaluations of research abstracts involving conflict of interests (Silverman et al., 2010). In effect, the algorithm we use (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008) points to a linguistic and social pathology that, like a virus, infects the biomedical literature. Such infection manifests itself by distorting the knowledge base and adversely affecting patient care.

Industry involvement in medicine has already done much good and has the potential to do much more. Numerous life-saving drugs and inventions have been developed either through industry research or with industry support. For example, research at Medtronic has contributed substantially to the improvement of the pacemaker. Industry involvement also means greater resources for medical research. Yet health care costs are spiraling out of control in the United States, while the pharmaceutical industry is consistently ranked as one of the most profitable (Barlett et al., 2004; Fortune 500, 2009). Medical companies now advertise products on television and in general-interest magazines as well as in medical journals. If what we have discovered about stance and voice and their distortion is true, these claims are systematically exaggerated. It would seem that, given the ethical imperative for reporting truthful findings, the deviance described in this chapter must be addressed.

# 7 Voice in Textbooks: between Exposition and Argument

Marina Bondi University of Modena and Reggio Emilia

# 1 Introduction: the concept of authorial voice

The notion of voice has been discussed from different perspectives in academic discourse studies, often in relation to discursive identity and self-representation. A major concern has been the formation of student writer identity, with the literature on composition often highlighting the need to show individuality and personal expressiveness in discourse (Bowden, 1995). Literacy studies have also pointed to writers’ need to demonstrate awareness of the discourse practices of their community and to take a stance towards other social codes and voices (Ivanicˇ, 1998), insisting that all writing reinterprets collective voice types in ways that locate users culturally and historically (Ivanicˇ and Camps, 2001). Teachers are asked to draw attention to issues of discursive identity, to the resources we use to project other voices, and to the continuous process of becoming in discourse (Prior, 2001). Educational debate has often centred on different cultural traditions in writing, showing great interest in the potential disadvantage of L2 writers (Ramanathan and Atkinson, 1999) whose individual voice may differ from the experience and expertise of writers from other cultures (Le Ha, 2009). Many have warned against a tendency to associate voice with individualism and to overlook the voices of L2 writers (Matsuda, 2001; Hirvela and Belcher, 2001), in line with critical approaches to the multiplicity of voices manifested by each writer. Increasing attention has also been paid to voice as the reader’s construction of the author’s voice (Matsuda and Tardy, 2007), interpreted in terms of Bakhtinian dialogism by Tang (2009).

Descriptive studies of voice in academic discourse have referred to a dialogic view of language, discourse and authority (e.g. Silver and Bondi, 2004; Fløttum et al., 2006; Fløttum, 2007). Bakhtin’s (1981)

dialogism emphasizes the heteroglossia and internal stratification of any language, the dynamic process of taking and using another person’s words, and the different degrees of distance that one may assume from one’s own discourse. The multiplicity of textual voices in academic writing also includes the virtual voices of readers. Writers often address potential objections by showing temporary agreement with claims, which are then refuted, or subsequently revised. All this leads to a broad view of voice markers, including not only the most overt interactional features, engaging writers and readers explicitly in the process, but also the more discreet interactive features, i.e. language choices that show ‘the writer’s awareness of a participating audience and the ways he or she seeks to accommodate its probable knowledge, interests, rhetorical expectations and processing abilities’ (Hyland, 2005: 49).

The range of relevant voice markers becomes extremely wide. Reference to discourse participants obviously plays a key role, as shown for example by studies on the use of first person in student writing (Tang and John, 1999) or self-mention in expert writing (Hyland, 2002a), but these are clearly extended to all forms of engagement and interpersonal metadiscourse in general (Hyland, 2005), including markers of evaluation (Hunston, 2000), whether expressing status (e.g. epistemic markers) or value (e.g. attitudinal markers). The writer’s interpretative position in the text and the dialogic involvement of other voices can be seen as constitutive of authorial identity (Bondi, 2007), together with forms of explicit self- and other-representation.

Studies on academic discourse have become increasingly interested in evaluative language use, whether under the heading of evaluation or stance (Hunston and Thompson, 2000; Hyland, 2000; Mauranen and Bondi, 2003; Biber, 2006; Giannoni, 2010; Hunston, 2011), looking not only at forms of self-attribution (e.g. we can argue that), but also to unattributed expressions of writer’s stance (e.g. it is important to note). Evaluative language use plays a major part in the definition of voice in many approaches. Martin and White (2005: 161) speak of ‘evaluative key’, referring to patterns in the use of evaluative resources occurring consistently across discourse domains; these patterns originate in conventionalized ‘styles’ or ‘regimes’ of evaluative positioning that ‘construct particular authorial identities or personas’. Stance-taking thus becomes a chief element in the writer’s voice, not only as an individual but also from a cultural, domain-related and genre-related standpoint.

What constitutes authorial voice in a textbook? Textbook writers tend to hide behind the values of the community, often attributing stance to the community in general, but attention should be paid to ways of expressing epistemic and deontic modality, attitudinal values or evaluations of importance. All these manifest the writer’s position as to his/her own topic and discourse, contributing to the construction of the writer’s voice. Their role in textbooks can be crucial and strategic to the management of reader–writer interaction.

Focusing on authorial voice in academic textbooks, this chapter looks at writers’ professional identities, studying how they relate discursively to their object of discourse as well as to other textual voices, especially other discourse participants – the student-reader and the discourse community at large. The next section presents an overview of the literature on voice in textbooks and shows that a range of lexico-grammatical tools can be used in the typical moves of instructional discourse. We then present a sample study of a corpus of academic history, representative of the authorial voices university students are exposed to in their early studies.

# 1.1 Authorial voice in textbooks

Textbooks are interestingly linked to ‘a subject’s methodology and values’ and therefore likely to ‘contain textual features and conventions of their respective disciplinary communities’ (Hyland, 1999: 4) – ways of arguing, specific approaches, theories and positions. The representation of scientific discourse can be shown to be a central issue in the genre and to play a leading role in introductory chapters (Bondi, 1997, 1998), by explicitly initiating the reader-student in the basic conventions of the scientific community.

In English for Academic Purposes (EAP) studies, however, the emphasis on genre analysis in the last 20 years or so has raised greater interest in research genres. Textbooks are held to be good at transmitting the ‘canon’, but not at fostering critical reading (Swales, 1994). Students are introduced to the basic notions and questions of a discipline, but they are not necessarily presented with a picture of the multiplicity of positions that characterize scientific debate. Textbooks seem to conceal the argumentative nature of disciplinary knowledge by presenting a wellestablished set of facts and theories.

The issue of factivity fulfils an essential function in the genre. Myers (1992: 13) argues that textbooks typically add ‘factive’ certitude to the phenomena being described by avoiding hedging, by lack of references to the primary literature, by a wide use of the simple present and by a massive use of cross-references. This draws attention to an interesting paradox of textbooks: what makes them easier for students to read ‘may make it harder for them to deal with other text types they encounter later in a scientific career [...] because they get no sense of how facts are established’ (Myers, 1992: 13). The pedagogic implications of this have often led applied linguists to point out that textbooks do not provide useful models for the teaching of writing (e.g. Paxton, 2007).

Hedging and attribution are pivotal elements in academic discourse. The need to hedge statements is usually higher in research articles than in textbooks, given the nature of the interaction: writers know that claims of originality may challenge their readers’ own assumptions and theories when readers expect ‘that their own views will be somehow acknowledged’ (Hyland, 2000: 93). Textbooks show a tendency to use fewer hedges: in economics, for example, generalizing adverbials tend to occur in mid-position, rather than as sentence adverbs, in typical general–specific patterns (Bondi, 2002). The language used in setting out a canon may veil the argumentative nature of research discourse to emphasize the accredited nature of knowledge, often using boosters to give readers an idea of scientific progress (Hyland, 2000).

Attribution is also a minor component of textbooks. Writers usually make limited use of quotations from relevant literature, while often summarizing debates through forms of generalized attribution (e.g. according to one argument …, there is no clear consensus as to …). Introductory chapters of economics textbooks are typically devoted to a presentation of the discipline and its methodology (Bondi, 1999: 37–69) and aim at a representation of what economists think or should think. Metadiscursive practices centre on generic reference and highlight moves like identifying a problem, presenting methodological tools, representing debate within the discipline and guiding the reader through argument (Bondi, 2005). This does not prevent textbooks from taking articulate positions about the arguments they report. Writers’ discourse is often juxtaposed with reported argument in a sort of ‘montage’, turning it into forms of constructed debate (Bondi, 1997) that somehow mould the reader, by establishing shared knowledge and accepted reasoning strategies, in accord with the apprenticeship function of textbooks (Hyland, 1999; Bhatia, 2002).

A critical analysis of textbooks could help readers see the traces of different types of dialogues (Bondi, 1998): the debates taking place in the context, the dialogic interactions represented in the text, and the ongoing textual dialogue of writers interacting with their readers. The use of personal pronouns like you or we (Poppi, 2004) or that of interrogatives and imperatives (Hyland, 2002b) are just the most obvious signals of this dialogue. They presuppose and explicitly mark the presence of a reader whose attention is captured and selectively focused on key issues or junctures in the writer’s argument. The mise-en-scène of the dialogue with the reader is often direct in materials that are openly presented as coursework. In economics, for example (Bondi, 1998), the textbook writer often asks questions or makes suggestions and addresses the reader directly. At other times the writer’s (and the reader’s) voice may be ‘distanced’ by reporting frameworks or by projecting reader and writer on to ‘third persons’: you might wonder, you should be able to realize, anyone who understands macroeconomic analysis can realize, etc. Textbook writers often assign readers different roles in the construction of their own argument: readers may be asked to draw inferences, to make objections, even to assume a given ideological position, only to be brought to agreement with the writer by successive argumentative steps (Bondi, 1997).

Writer–reader dialogue, however, is not only realized by formal indicators of an addressee. It is also realized pragmatically by the coherence that the addressee can establish in textual structures. Textbooks are often characterized by repetition of schematic structures. Economics textbooks, for example, display regular expository patterns, where general statements about processes are preceded or followed by specific examples. As shown in Bondi (1999: 49), this expository structure might be interpreted both in terms of textual patterns and of didactic moves.

Textbooks can thus be seen at the intersection of two orders of discourse: educational and disciplinary (Hyland, 2000: 107). They incorporate established disciplinary knowledge in a text that reflects a teacher–student relationship in the typical communicative functions of description, definition, classification and predictive structures, together with easyfication procedures: rhetorical questions, visual elements, metadiscourse (Bhatia, 2002: 32–3). Other elements that can be related to the pedagogic dimension of the genre are simplification, abstraction and analogical reasoning. Grammatical metaphor and nominalization are habitually listed among the features of textbooks (Coffin, 2006). Nominalization is also higher in metadiscursive practices, turning the argumentative procedures of the community into discourse objects (Bondi, 2001). Cross-generic analysis also shows that greater cognitive difference between reader and writer often induces a wider use of simplified hypothetical scenarios and analogical procedures (Bondi, 1999), variously shaping readers’ mental constructs. When representing themselves as experts, writers seem to adopt a knowledge transfer perspective of teaching (Hyland, 2009: 120).

My analyses suggest textbook writers see themselves as both researchers and teachers. As researchers, they take position towards different approaches or positions. As teachers, they interact with other educators and with the students – the ‘evaluator reader’ and ‘consumer reader’ (Swales, 1994). Building on this distinction, we can identify different writer/reader roles for the textbook writer: arguer/partner in argument, researcher/researcher, textbook writer/textbook evaluator, teacher/student and teacher/fellow teacher (Bondi, 1998). Studies of writer identity and authorial voice in textbooks usually focus on professional identities rather than personal traits, even when dealing with specific case studies of very successful writers (e.g. Poppi, 2009 on Samuelson). We take the same stand here and look at the features that characterize textbook writers as such (i.e. keywords and relevance markers), testing some of the general trends on the borderline case of textbooks in the humanities.

# 2 History: a sample cross-generic study

If the difference between instructional and research materials is easily observable in the natural and social sciences, it is much fuzzier in the humanities at university level. The idea of a book constituting the basis for all subsequent studies is less widely accepted and students are exposed to a broader range of textual forms. Although some books are identified as introductory textbooks, there is much greater variation in their structure and scope than there is in the hard sciences. Set reading books in history, for example, may cover extensive major periods (e.g. medieval history), specific areas (e.g. Spanish history) or particular aspects of history (e.g. social history), rather than core theoretical issues. Reference work may be structured in chapters written by different authors, typically covering their special field of expertise. The distinction between textbooks and research articles is less clear-cut: there is a continuum between the texts that most explicitly address undergraduate students and the most unequivocally research-based journal article.

The discourse of history has another major peculiarity: the tension between narrative and argument in the basic structure of its discourse. The fundamental notions and facts are not just presented to the student in sequences of generalizations and examples, but rather in a narrative account of events in a particular context. If temporal notions play a major role (cf. Coffin, 1997, 2006), especially through the representation of time sequences and time settings (‘packaging time’, Martin, 2003: 28), it is the interpretative dimension of historical narratives that captures its essence. Schleppegrell and de Oliveira (2006: 256) identify three critical linguistic challenges in the discourse of history: the interaction of time and cause, the use of abstraction to generalize from particular events and the foregrounding or backgrounding of interpretation (a more or less explicit interpretive stance).

Academic history is not just a narrative account of facts, but also interpretation of narrated events, and ultimately dialogic argumentation of the interpretation put forward. Adapting Coffin (1997), we can say that historians will accordingly appear in different roles – as Recounters (in the textual narrative), as Interpreters (in the interpretation of narrated events) and as Academic Arguers (in the dialogic argumentation of the interpretation) (Bondi, 2007: 68). The distinction between the roles of Interpreter and Academic Arguer is more one of degree than of kind. Writers present their arguments in ways that are aware of a reader in both cases, but overtly emphasizing either internal consistency or dialogic positioning. This is all Appraiser voice in Coffin’s terms (2006: 152–5), even if increasingly engaging with alternative perspectives along the curriculum.

Cross-disciplinary analysis of academic research genres has revealed that, despite historians keeping a very low profile in terms of metadiscourse (Bondi, 2005) and giving great prominence to a variety of textual voices (Silver and Bondi, 2004; Bondi, 2007), their discourse can still be characterized by the strong presence of an evaluating self. When looking at parameters of evaluation (Hunston and Thompson, 2000: 23–4), history seems to highlight evaluations of relevance or importance (Bondi, 2008), noticing the significance of events in the framework of a specific interpretation. Expressions of importance do not just present a writer’s stance: they signal how significant elements are in the world of the text or in the organization of discourse. They can thus be interpreted pragmatically as directing the reader’s attention to the proposition and its role in the co-text. The small-scale study presented here looks at voice markers and evaluations of importance in particular, across different genres of academic history.

# 2.1 Materials and methods

The study is based on the analysis of two corpora of materials designed to contrast academic textbooks and journal articles. The main corpus includes 30 chapters, randomly chosen from books that are variously identified as textbooks by publishers and by being set reading in early undergraduate English-medium courses. The volumes cover sociocultural, economic and general issues with reference to the UK, the US, Europe and the world, spanning across medieval, modern and contemporary, including thematic works. A corpus of journal articles comprising about 2.5 million words was used as a reference corpus.

The study combines a corpus and a discourse perspective. It draws on discourse and genre analysis for issues of contextual interpretation, considering both the macro-field of social action (academic discourse) and the characteristics of the genre. Corpus linguistics offers tools of lexical analysis, through some of the functions of Wordsmith Tools (Scott, 2008). A preliminary look at keywords – word forms that are significantly more or less frequent in one corpus or text as against a reference corpus (see also Bondi and Scott, 2010) – offers an overview of quantitative variation. A case study of markers of importance (‘relevance’ in Giannoni, 2010: 175–208) is then presented, through an analysis of concordances and collocations, highlighting how entities and processes are marked out for their significance.

# 2.2 Keywords: an overview

Keywords provide an interesting sketch of the lexico-grammatical resources of book chapters. Ignoring the quite expectedly high number of keywords referring to specific historical actors and processes, we focused on general lexis.

The top positive keywords – i.e. those more frequent in chapters than in articles – included many categories that can be related to writer/ reader interaction as described in the literature. The most striking feature is the number of quantifiers found, ranging from per cent/ percentage to exact figures (grouped as # by the software), including indefinite quantifiers and approximators (some, about, mid, nearly, many, much, half, total, quarter). If we combine this with the very high keyness score of simple-past basic auxiliaries (was, had, were) and a wide range of verbs of change and their nominalizations (decline, remained, became, grew, fall, rise, growing, increased, rising, declined, began), we get a picture of the importance attributed to the reporting of facts and trends. Typical textual structures involve a general statement supported by specific data, as in Example 1, with its obviously expositive pattern:

(1) If, then, the ability to sign one’s name is a reliable index of literacy, the aggregate data show a notable rise in the numbers of men and women able to read and write during the eighteenth century. In Scotland, literacy among adult males rose from approximately 25 per cent in 1643 to 65 per cent in the 1750s. Figures for England in the 1640s suggest a literacy rate for adult men of around 30 per cent; by the mid-eighteenth century this percentage had grown to 60 per cent, with a corresponding rate for adult females at around 35–40 per cent. Statistics for France point to a similar rise. In 1686–90, only about

29 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women were able to sign their names in parish marriage registers; by 1786–90, the percentage had grown to 48 per cent of men and 27 per cent of women.

If passages like this seem to emphasize what we have called the voice of the Recounter, other elements (see Example 2) point to the voice of the Interpreter, for instance the presence among positive keywords of potential elements of evaluation in terms of status (e.g. seemed, probably) and of value (e.g. huge, most, major, successful, low, hard):

(2) Unlike Richard Nixon’s landslide victory in 1972, Ronald Reagan’s thumping of Jimmy Carter seemed to signal a sea change in American politics, a major shift from a liberal to a conservative majority.

The clearest patterns, however, are found in the negative keywords, the words that are significantly missing from book chapters when compared to articles. Negative keywords are vastly dominated by general lexis: 93 out of the 209 negative keywords are clearly not topic-related. These general words fall largely within the category of potential metadiscourse items. The highest keyness scores are found for self-reference (e.g. I, my, we, our, me, us, but also article, study, essay, pages, section, paper, book), references to the discipline (e.g. history, historical) and to a very long list of nouns referring to the basic cognitive constructs of the discipline (e.g. analysis, knowledge, account, discussion, matter, text, context, questions, category, explanation, relationship, story, narrative/s, concepts, meaning, interpretation, definition, case, method, proof, approach, meanings, point/s, studies, etc.). This combines with the presence of conclusion markers (such as thus and suggests), connectors like how, what, that and as – often involved in a ‘local grammar of evaluation’ (Hunston and Sinclair, 2000; Hunston, 2011) – and explicitly evaluative elements like original and modal must, will, can. The voice that seems to be missing here is that of the Academic Arguer, typically represented in articles by sections that not only highlight the scope of the claim made, but also assess other claims, or place one’s argument in the context of current debate, as in Example 3:

(3) While this article is very much an exploratory one, it indicates that the records of the Manx secular courts constitute an extremely rich resource with which to test the assumptions of early modern historians about the nature and pattern of the prosecution of crime and, perhaps more importantly, of civil litigation. We will welcome the opportunity to pursue broad comparisons with other samples of litigation from the period, but even at this early stage of our analysis, it would appear that the broad fluctuations of business in English local and national courts were paralleled in those of the island. The more detailed analysis of samples of Manx court business which may allow a greater precision in mapping and explaining such fluctuations, and consequently of pursuing comparisons, has yet to be carried out. Early soundings, however, suggest that such an analysis would deepen our understanding of that neglected area of historical investigation: civil litigation. […] Civil litigation demands closer attention in the near future, and it is clear that the study of the courts of the Isle of Man will make an important contribution to this process.

# 2.3 Importance markers

The only marker with a significantly higher frequency in textbooks is major, with a frequency of about 4 pttw (per ten thousand words), as against 2 pttw in articles (keyness score 38.83). The peculiarity of this marker (shared by other less frequent ones grouped with it by Giannoni, 2010) is that all its occurrences are attributive rather than predicative. This means evaluation is an element of the clause, though not necessarily its main discourse function. Of the 130 evaluative occurrences of major, all of them attributive, 81 (62 per cent) simply qualify historical actors within the narrative, without any reference to their role and the reasons for the importance (e.g. By 1800 most of the major cities of the future Midwest had already been founded), whereas 49 (38 per cent) are involved in acts of evaluation, pointing to the role of actors and processes in the temporal–causal sequence of events (e.g. The major causes of the buoyancy were the rapid expansion of world trade and investment, or they [reformers] proved a major force behind Maria Theresia’s compulsory school edict of 1774). Authorial voice can take up the role of the Interpreter more clearly when the adjective qualifies a general abstract noun referring to metacognitive constructs of exposition (e.g. example, features, aspect, element, issue), causality (e.g. factor, force, contribution, causes) or temporality (e.g. change, shift, progress), preceded or followed by linking verbs (e.g. the major factor is, … were major factors). The collocation with general nouns allows attributive adjectives to take part in predicative constructions. The vast majority of these are found in narrative sequences with no explicit reference to a debate or form of explicit engagement with alternative perspectives. Only four occurrences collocate with explicit reporting/citation (related to the evaluation of importance averred by the writer), and another three are involved in general reference (to the impression one gets, the importance people attribute and the question tackled by many studies).

Other interesting markers of importance are the lexical sets importance, important, importantly and significance, significant, significantly. These are not statistical keywords, but they are foregrounded in articles by the most typical evaluative patterns involving adjectival forms: it is/would be/seem to be … to/that. While important is the most frequent adjective altogether in the to-pattern (64/492), significant is the most frequent importance adjective in the that-pattern (14/364). The quantitative data in both corpora are presented in Tables 7.1(a) and (b).

The data confirm the general trends observed in the literature on textbooks. Evaluation of importance is generally less frequent in book chapters than in articles, and this is especially true of the nominal elements of the sets, where normalized frequency is almost halved, whereas adverbials, in a reversed trend, are slightly more used.

Adjectives, though showing no significant quantitative variation, reveal a preference for different phraseological contexts. Articles show frequent clusters like: it is important to note, one of the most important, play(ed) an important role, was an important part of, it is important to stress or it is significant that, a significant number of, a significant role in, a significant proportion of, played a significant role, a significant impact on. Textbook chapters (obviously much more limited in size), mostly employ repetition of the superlatives (e.g. the most significant, one of the most important) and played an important role. The use of anticipatory it thematizing the evaluation (e.g. it is important to note that) is more limited, thus reducing the visibility of evaluation in textbooks.

The adverbials considered, both recurring more often in textbooks, show divergent patterns. Significantly, rarely used as an intensifier in both corpora $\mathrm { \ } 4 4 / 2 1 4 = 2 0 . 5$ per cent in journal articles, $6 / 3 0 = 2 0 $ per cent in book chapters), often takes thematic position, extending its scope to cohesive functions, typically to introduce an important element corroborating or elaborating a previous statement. This happens more prominently in book chapters $( 9 / 3 0 = 2 5 $ per cent) than in journal articles $3 8 / 2 1 4 = 1 7 . 7 $ per cent). Importantly, on the other hand, usually marks a climax in a list including alternative perspectives, underlining the decisive element among many. Thematic position, normally extending its scope above the sentence, is somewhat more common in journal articles $\langle 5 6 / 9 4 = 5 9 . 5 7$ per cent) than book chapters $( 8 / 1 5 = 5 3 . 3 $ per cent).

A closer look at significance and importance reveals interesting trends. If post-modification largely corresponds to qualifying adjectives (e.g. position of importance/important position), head position can easily turn ‘importance’ into the subject or object of a clause, one that can be modified by adjectives (e.g. less/unprecedented/growing importance; great/modest/little significance) or subjected to an explicit assessment (e.g. the significance of these measures should not be underestimated, one can hardly exaggerate the importance of moral weeklies). Nominalized evaluation can also be more easily attributed (6/22 occurrences of significance and 15/50 of importance) and be part of explicit statements of purpose (e.g. We set out to evaluate the relative importance of problems, How can we assess the importance of careerism in late Medieval England?). The tendency to use the nominal in reporting evaluation and in self-attribution is slightly higher in articles (up to 40 per cent with importance), but modified occurrences are more numerous in textbooks (44 against 40 per cent). On the whole, then, book chapters do not fully exploit the potential of nominals in representing academic argument, but they do highlight the possibility to assess importance, once again privileging the voice of the Interpreter over the Academic Arguer.

# Conclusions

The chapter has looked at voice as manifesting a multiplicity of identities in discourse. This implies a wide range of voice markers, from self-mention to forms of engagement and markers of evaluation, spotlighting the writer’s interpretative position in the text and the dialogic involvement of other voices.

Most literature on textbooks so far has looked at them as merely expositive texts, concealing the argumentative nature of science, in order to offer an established view of the discipline. The chapter has investigated this, pointing out issues like factivity, hedging, attribution, metadiscourse and repetitive textual structures as elements contributing to the voice of the textbook writer addressing the student as well as the colleague.

Historical discourse seems to deviate from some specific tendencies noted in the hard and social sciences. Hedging, for example, was found to be more frequent in book chapters than in journal articles, but it was also accompanied by greater display of data and facts. The overview of positive and negative keywords revealed a varied use of authorial voice: the textbook writer moves between the Recounter (with an emphasis on facts and the narrative) and the Interpreter (assessing historical actors and processes of change), whereas the researcher talking to other researchers in the journal article favours the Academic Arguer (placing the research in the context of a debate). Markers of importance conform to this tendency, variously showing a preference for forms that assess entities and processes, rather than alternative perspectives. The voice of the Interpreter, supported by the authority of the Recounter, may well be the most suitable for a genre addressing such a wide range of readers with their background knowledge and expertise.

# Part III Stance and Voice in Student Genres

# 8 Achieving a Voice of Authority in PhD Theses

Paul Thompson University of Birmingham, UK

# 1 Introduction: a three-level model of stance and voice for PhD theses

The doctoral thesis is the highest form of assessed student writing in the sphere of British higher education. While it can vary greatly in form, tone, epistemology and purpose across disciplines, which makes it difficult to generalize features, a common point is that candidates have to be persuasive. To convince examiners that they are worthy of the award of a doctorate, their texts need to meet a twofold rhetorical challenge: firstly, they must project a voice of individual expert authority through the developing text, and, secondly, they must also position themselves in relation to their thesis subject and ultimately within a disciplinary community. They must, in sum, achieve both a distinct voice and a distinct stance.

In this chapter I will discuss notions of voice and stance in relation to PhD theses, adopting the broad definition of ‘voice’ put forward by Matsuda (2001: 40): ‘Voice is the amalgamative effect of the use of discursive and non-discursive features that language users choose, deliberately or otherwise, from socially available yet ever-changing repertoires; it is the overall impression.’ In other words, ‘voice’ derives from a range of aspects of the text, both linguistic and non-linguistic.

I propose that it is useful to see both voice and stance as existing on a number of levels, ranging from the proposition through to the whole text. At a propositional level we can distinguish the voice that is responsible for a given statement (the writer or some other source) and also the stance that the writer takes towards that proposition. At the other extreme, at the level of the whole thesis, the voice is the cumulative impression of the writer that has been constructed through the text, and the stance is the position of this writer in relation to the main issues addressed in the research. At intermediate levels, ‘voice’ refers to the projection of distinct writer personae within different sections of the whole text and ‘stance’ to the positions that the writer takes towards ideas and entities in parts of it. Clearly, in a chapter of this length it is not possible to analyse exhaustively how voice is built up throughout an entire PhD thesis (the ‘whole text’ extreme), but it is possible to see how choices at the proposition and intermediate levels may contribute towards the voice that the writer develops globally. These concepts will be further elaborated in Sections 2 and 3 below, following a discussion of doctoral theses in Section 1.1, with examples taken from PhD theses given in each section.

# 1.1 Thesis variability and the problem of standards

To illustrate the gradations of voice at various levels, I will draw on previous research on thesis writing and take examples from a corpus of theses that I used for my own doctoral research. The thesis samples are part of the Reading Academic Text corpus, a collection of research articles and doctoral theses established at the University of Reading (see Thompson, 2001). They come from a range of disciplines, including agricultural botany, agricultural economics, history and psychology.

It is worth noting that in England there is no distinction made between a high-quality thesis and a ‘bare pass’ one. Universities typically require that a thesis should make an ‘original contribution to knowledge’ and have the potential to be publishable in some form, but these are general formulations open to considerable diversity in interpretation. In a review of doctoral examination practices in England, Denicolo (2003) observes that there is a lack of clarity in standards and procedures. One consequence of this is that there is variability in quality and no information available to indicate whether or not the examiners considered a thesis well written. One cannot be certain, therefore, whether or not the sample texts one analyses are examples of highly valued theses. However, by taking a corpus-based approach it is possible to make generalizations based on recurrent patterns and frequency information and maintain that the majority of theses conform to what is taken as acceptable.

Secondly, we should bear in mind that, given their considerable disciplinary variation, PhD theses do not follow one single pattern of organization. Paltridge (2002) proposes four types: the ‘traditional simple’, and ‘traditional complex’ (after Thompson, 1999), the ‘topic-based’ and the ‘compilation of research articles’ (after Dong, 1998). I will exclude the article-compilation type from consideration here and concentrate on the three types of thesis in which the primary audience is the examiners, and, in some cases, as reported in Thompson (1999), fellow researchers within a project team. In the first of these, the thesis is structured as a scientific research report, with separate chapters for the introduction, methods, results and discussion (IMRD). The traditional complex thesis normally begins with an introduction and a review of the literature that precedes a sequence of chapters, each of them following the IMRD pattern, and concludes with a general summary chapter. The topic-based thesis, common in the humanities, opens with an introductory chapter and develops a series of topic-based chapters.

Another feature of variation is length. Within the Reading Academic Text corpus, for example, theses range from approximately 10,000 words to 118,000 words of running text. The shortest thesis is on biotechnology and it originally contained numerous tables and figures later excluded from the corpus version. The longest is a history thesis. In some research fields, such as biotechnology, the emphasis is on brevity and much information can be conveyed in numbers, diagrams and photographs, whereas in others the emphasis is on extended verbal exposition and argumentation.

# 2 Averral and attribution at the proposition level

We will begin by looking voice at the level of the proposition. A key concept here is that of averral and its counterpart, attribution. Averral is the ‘default condition’ of a written text (Tadros, 1993: 101) in that it identifies, and is thus identified with, the textual voice of the writer herself or himself. An example of an averred proposition (taken from the thesis corpus) is:

The Animal Health and Veterinary Group has a Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO - Grade 3) together with an Under-Secretary of Animal Health.

The writer does not attribute the statement to another source but takes full responsibility for the proposition and also for according it the status of ‘fact’.

Attribution is the use of a manifest intertextual marker (in academic writing this is usually in the form of a citation) to acknowledge an antecedent authorial voice. Attributions are defined as ‘reports in the text which have the effect of transferring responsibility for what is being said’ (Tadros, 1993: 104). The following sentence from an agricultural economics thesis exemplifies the complex interplay between averral and attribution:

This idea is formalised by Porter and van der Linde (1995) who argue that imposition of environmental standards can induce technological innovation which may more than offset the costs of complying with the imposed standards.

The whole sentence is by default an averral (in that the writer ultimately takes responsibility for whatever is chosen to appear in the text) but contains within it a proposition which is attributed to two other authors (Porter and van der Linde) and evaluated by the writer as having the status of an argument (‘who argue that’). In Hunston’s (1993) terms, this indicates that the writer is not committed to the truth of the reported proposition – that is, the evaluation of the proposition by the writer expresses his/her stance. Stance is consequently an aspect of voice (it contributes to the impression of the writer in the text) and plays a particularly important role in reporting, since the writer’s attitude to the reported proposition can be encoded in the reporting clause (Halliday, 1994; Thompson, 1996).

The interplay between averral and attribution is an essential feature of academic argument. In successful academic argumentation the writer’s is its dominant voice: other voices must be allowed to speak but they must be subordinated by, and thus subordinate to, the textual subjectivity of the writer herself or himself (Groom, 2000).

A basic distinction can be made between citations that are nonintegral and those that are integral: the former are placed outside the sentence, usually within brackets, and play no explicit grammatical role in the sentence, while the latter are those that play an explicit grammatical role within a sentence. Non-integral citations allow writers to focus on the proposition, while integral ones focus on the cited authors. In the agricultural botany theses, the preferred form of citation is non-integral, and the voices of others are not often brought into the text explicitly (Thompson, 2001). The eight theses in the corpus display an average of only one direct quotation per thesis, and citations tend to refer to the research actions and findings of other researchers. An example is:

cDNA clones have now been used to detect RFLPs in a number of plant species, including barley (Kleinhofs et al. 1993), potato (Gebhardt et al. 1989), apple (Watillon et al. 1991), lettuce (Landry et al. 1987) and tomato (Miller and Tanksley, 1990a).

This redundancy may have been caused by the preferential cloning chloroplast and/or repetitive sequences, which has also been reported in bamboo (Friar and Kochert, 1991), barley ( Jahoor et al. 1991) and Brassica species (Figdore et al. 1988). The screening of organellar clones can be avoided either by pre-screening the library with total radioactively-labelled chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA (Figdore et al. 1988) or by constructing the PstI library from DNA isolated from nuclei.

This extract contains a series of averred statements in which the citations are appended as evidence to justify the propositions or to identify the people who conducted particular pieces of research. Figdore et al., for instance, are the source of the proposition that screening of organellar clones can be avoided in two ways, but this is turned into an averred statement. Similarly, Kleinhofs et al. were responsible for the use of cDNA clones to detect RFLPs in barley, but the writer assumes responsibility for the reporting of Kleinhof et al.’s research and displays a detailed knowledge of previous work in the field while maintaining the dominant voice in the unfolding text. In this example the citations are supplementary and subject to this dominant voice, so each of them could be removed without affecting the propositions made.

In agricultural economics, by comparison, the preference is for integral citations, which in some cases can lead to the explicit introduction of others’ voices into the text as in the following example:

Birch (1980) states that in government departments where ministers move from one department to another quickly with only a short stay in any one, ‘... there may develop a “departmental policy” which is made by civil servants and accepted by successive ministers’. Selznick (1948) coined the term ‘cooptation’ in organizations, which he defines as a process of absorbing new elements into the leadership or policy-determining structure of an organization as a means of averting threats to its stability or existence (the use of committees, working parties etc. can have this function).

The above passage contains both a direct quotation and a paraphrase of text written by another writer. While direct quotation is still relatively infrequent in the agricultural economics theses (on average 28 direct quotations per thesis, and the average length of an agricultural economics thesis is 63,000 words), the writer of this text chooses to draw on the wording of others, and yet he retains a strong authorial presence by integrating the quotation into his own averred statement. Agricultural economics is often concerned with organizations, with policies and with the establishment of explanatory or predictive models, and there is thus greater emphasis on the projections, formulations and observations of researchers than there is in the experimental scientific approaches in agricultural botany.

History is a reconstructive discipline (Bazerman, 2010) which depends on documentary evidence of past events. The written word is the centre of attention in history (by contrast with archaeology, which focuses on physical objects) and this is reflected in a much higher use of quotations. In the two history theses in the corpus, there are in total 371 quotations, of which 174 are block quotations (the average length of a history thesis is 108,000 words). The quotations come both from primary and secondary sources and perform a different role from those in the two other disciplines.

Drinking and gambling were the great passions of the age, enjoyed and practised by all classes, and the government itself encouraged gambling in the form of lotteries. Members of Parliament were often elected amid a plenitude of drink given freely to their voters. One of the worst areas was probably Southwark, where ‘wealthy beer barons with hireling armies of draymen battled for the representation of Southwark’ for much of the century, but examples can be found in most towns. (219) The ruling classes openly indulged in these and other forms of immoral and dissolute behaviour – the same vices they wished to suppress in the poor.

The dominant voice in this paragraph is that of the author, but another’s voice is introduced to provide a colourful description of the situation in Southwark, a borough of London, in that period (the early eighteenth century). At one level, the author can be seen to be demonstrating the breadth of his reading, while at another level he is explicitly performing his synthesis of the accounts of the period. At a third level, there is a relish shown for the wording used by another author in the description of the human phenomena.

In the examples given above, we have briefly seen how thesis authors in different disciplines maintain a voice of authority in their writing by skilfully modulating the interplay between averral and attribution.

# 3 Voice features at intermediate levels

# 3.1 The role of metadiscourse

In Matsuda’s (2001) definition, ‘voice’ is not a set of specific textual features but the reader’s impression derived from the particular combination of the ways in which both discursive (e.g. sentence structures, organization, the use of transition devices, word choice, argumentative strategies) and non-discursive (i.e. presentational) features are used. In a more recent study, Matsuda and Tardy (2007) explored the notion that voice is constructed not only by writers but also by readers. These two researchers asked journal reviewers to evaluate a submission by an unknown researcher, describe the impression that they had built up of the writer, and enumerate the criteria behind that impression. Their responses comprised an interesting mix of references to style (e.g. conciseness, syntax), expertise and knowledge (e.g. use of terms, breadth of knowledge, awareness of full implications of argument) and rhetorical strategies.

A linguistic analysis of voice in PhD theses cannot evaluate the expertise and knowledge that writers in different disciplines demonstrate in their texts, but can engage with questions of preferred ways of saying things and of the employment of rhetorical strategies. It is axiomatic that a successful text should have coherence. If the relationship between propositions is not clear, or if the sequence does not contribute to a development of an argument, then the text is unlikely to be deemed successful. In placing sentences in a coherent, consistent order, the writer is able to develop a voice of authority.

Textual coherence is achieved through sequencing of the information in the text but it is augmented by the use of metadiscourse, which can help to cement the voice of authority. Metadiscourse is used to make explicit the structure of the text and it can also be used to handle the interpersonal aspects of the communication (Hyland, 2005). While the term is not always used in the same way, ‘metadiscourse’ typically works as an umbrella term for a range of linguistic features which relate a text to its context by helping readers ‘to connect, organize and interpret material in a way preferred by the writer’ (Hyland, 2005: 135).

Theses, as we have seen, are long texts and it is especially important for writers to employ metadiscourse to guide their readers around (Bunton, 1999; Swales, 1990). The writer can provide previews and reviews to set up expectations of what is to come and also to highlight the key points that will arise or which have emerged in the text. Alternatively, the writer can make cross-textual references which point the reader to other parts of the text of relevance to the present part – in many cases, this acts as a reminder of what has been described or discussed before.

Examples of cross-referencing, previewing and reviewing can be found surrounding the lemma CHAPTER. CHAPTER is the $^ \mathrm { 2 0 t h }$ most frequent noun in the thesis corpus, and occurs approximately nine times per chapter in the whole corpus. Given that one of these occurrences will be in the title of the chapter (e.g. ‘Chapter One’), this means that there are, on average, eight occurrences within the body of each chapter. Examples of the uses of the word are as follows:

Ex 1 Decision trees are a particularly useful way of doing this in that they provide a logical and visual means of analysing a decision problem, are able to incorporate estimates of risk in the form of probabilities attached to various events and are able to take account of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of a decision problem (see Chapter 5 on decision analysis).   
$\operatorname { E x } 2$ As was argued in the previous chapter, a greater strategic focus is called for, …   
Ex 3 This chapter draws together the main findings of the study.

In Example 1, the writer uses a prospective cross-reference to another part of the thesis to direct the reader to relevant discussion; in the second example, the reference is retrospective; in Example 3, the reference is prospective and the writer provides an overview of what is to come in the chapter. The lemma CHAPTER therefore plays an important role in metadiscursive statements which help the reader to see the structure of the argumentation and to make links between parts of an extensive text.

The chapter preview, in which the writer provides a description of the contents of the chapter, is a common feature of the theses in the corpus. Example 3 continues:

The first section summarises the additional information the thesis provides on the return to UK research. In the second section the focus is the difference between the intuitive assessment of the main case studies and objective economic analysis. The next two sections consider the implications of the study for ex post and ex ante assessment of research respectively. Finally the study’s contribution to the ‘economics of research’ literature is examined and the scope for further research is discussed.

The preview typically breaks the chapter into its main sections and explains what will be presented in each. The assumption underlying the preview is that the reader will be able to process the information and ideas in the chapter more effectively if they are told what to expect.

The example given above is from an agricultural economics thesis, and follows a conventional structure of ‘summary’, ‘implications’, ‘contribution of the thesis’ and ‘further research directions’. The next example, from history, follows different conventions, and is simply focused on the research question; it begins with a summary of the thesis and then a consideration of what answers have been provided for the research question:

This thesis sets out with two objectives: firstly, to describe and explain the pattern of growth of the allotment movement in England between 1793 and 1873, and secondly, to examine the place of allotments within rural society in these years. These objectives were addressed respectively in Parts One and Two of the current work. In this final chapter, the main findings of Parts One and Two will be presented in turn. To conclude the study, an attempt will be made, on the basis of these findings, to answer the question of how successful the allotment movement was.

Another way in which the thesis writer can guide the reader but at a more local, restricted level, is through the use of ‘labelling’ nouns such as ‘problem’, ‘solution’, ‘question’ or ‘hypothesis’. Labelling nouns are ‘inherently unspecific nominal elements’ that depend on lexical realization in the co-text (Francis, 1994: 83). In other words, they take on meaning from a proposition or series of propositions in the co-text, and also give those propositions a value. They can work retrospectively or prospectively.

ANOVA of plant dry weights at 100 DAE, however, still indicate a significant effect due to initial seed size, particularly of the largest and smallest sized seeds. This finding contradicts much published work where seedling advantages due to differences in seed size are relatively short-lived (Stanton, 1984, Weiner, et al., 1997).

In this example, the word ‘finding’ takes on meaning from the previous sentence in which it is reported that statistical tests showed that plant dry weights were significantly affected by differences in seed size. Concurrently, the proposition is accorded the status of a ‘finding’, a research-based outcome that can in turn be compared with researchbased observations made by other researchers.

In earlier work (Thompson, 2009) I have discussed the use of ‘prob$\operatorname { l e m } ^ { \prime }$ to identify propositions as having the status of problems, as in this example from an agricultural botany thesis: ‘The major problem in breeding with a single source of resistance is that the pathogen will evolve rapidly to overcome it.’ The proposition is that ‘if one uses only one source of resistance to a pathogen, then the pathogen will evolve quickly and overcome it’ and this is identified as a problem. The researcher’s task is to identify problems in advance and find ways to avoid them or solve them, and by using this formulation the writer both constructs himself or herself as a researcher and also helps the reader to follow the logic of the argument by attributing problem status to the proposition. The pattern ‘determiner $^ +$ adjective [optional] $^ +$ PROBLEM $^ +$ [optional postmodification] $^ +$ auxiliary [optional] $^ +$ BE $^ +$ that/ to’ was found to account for 14 per cent of the occurrences of ‘problem’ in literature review sections in the theses, four times more frequent than it is in the BNC, where the pattern accounts for 3.5 per cent of the instances (Thompson, 2009).

Charles (2003) investigated the uses of retrospective labelling nouns in a corpus of theses in two disciplines, materials science and politics. She detected differences in the choice of noun, with the politics theses featuring more metalinguistic nouns, such as ‘argument’, and nouns that are inherently marked for stance, such as ‘confusion’ or ‘failure’. Charles argues that labelling nouns are an important resource for the thesis writer to construct persuasive arguments and express stance in a way appropriate to the disciplinary community. As postulated above, stance is a part of voice, and so the expression of stance in the use of a labelling noun is part of the authorial voice and of the argumentation.

As we have seen in this section, thesis writers guide their readers through section/chapter previews and reviews and through intratextual references. They also indicate the status of propositions by using labelling nouns such as ‘problem’, ‘question’ and ‘evidence’. In so doing, they aim to demonstrate control of their texts as disciplinary authorities and to maintain the coherence of the argument.

# 3.2 Asserting one’s achievement

One feature that most, if not all, theses have in common is a conclusions or summary chapter, an important part of the text in which the author takes stock of the research presented in the thesis and evaluates the achievement. As stated in the previous section, this is the chapter in which the writer summarizes the main findings or arguments of the thesis, places these within a wider context, discusses the contributions and limitations of the work and also suggests future directions for research in the area (see Bunton, 2005 for a move analysis of conclusions chapters in PhD theses).

In the following examples, we can see how two writers summarize the main contribution of their research and indicate how their findings disprove the theories of other researchers. This negative evaluation of another research team’s ideas is potentially dangerous, and that is why it is hedged by the author in order to save the face of other members of one’s research community. Hedging constitutes a conflict avoidance strategy that allows thesis writers to put forward their claims as to the value of their research (i.e. originality and contribution) with strength and yet also show caution and deference to the discipline.

The first example is from a thesis in agricultural botany:

One of the important questions to be addressed by this study was the origin of black Sigatoka in the Americas. Both the RAPD data and ITS1 sequence information strongly suggest that M. fijiensis arose in the Americas as a result of introduction. The genetic distance between M. fijiensis and M. musicola, determined by these methods of analysis, suggests that the populations have been reproductively isolated for much longer than the 20–30 years since the discovery of M. fijiensis in the Americas. In addition, if M. fijiensis arose by mutation in the Americas, it would be expected to be genetically distinct from the isolates from the Pacific. No such differences were observed. This confirms the recent re-classifications of these organisms based on morphological criteria (Pons, 1990).

In this paragraph, the writer summarizes and discusses the answers that her research has provided regarding the origin of the black Sigatoka disease in the Americas. Her findings support the argument that black Sigatoka was introduced into the Americas and not that it was the result of a mutation of another disease. She states first that her analyses support the work of Pons (1990), before moving in the second paragraph to comment on how these findings also indicate that another researcher’s theory is not correct:

Although these results do not explain the precise means of this introduction, they tend to refute the hypothesis put forward by Buddenhagen (1987) that M. fijiensis arose in Honduras due to mutation and selection pressure from the population of M. musicola already present on that continent. It is more likely that M. fijiensis was introduced into Central America on contaminated banana foliage used as packing material as suggested by Stover (1978), or in the distribution of banana germplasm for the breeding programmes active at that time.

The rejection of the alternative hypothesis is highly mitigated (‘tend to refute’) and the writer appears to be showing a concern for the face of the researcher (Buddenhagen) who proposed that hypothesis. She is also, it can be argued, taking a strategically cautious position in order to be able to sidestep criticism. The form of the hedge (‘tend to refute’) could be judged to be exaggerated (conference audiences that I have presented this example to tend to find it amusing) but it should be seen within context – the hedge is typical of the writer’s style of expression. In an earlier chapter, she wrote ‘These data would tend to suggest that the pathogen was introduced into Latin America from the Pacific islands’ and in the final chapter she stated ‘the results do tend to discount the likelihood of M. fijiensis and M. musicola crossing in the wild’. In the other seven agricultural botany theses in the corpus, there are only two similar uses of ‘tend to’ as mitigation for a claim. This example, then, illustrates a complex mixture of a personal voice (the idiosyncratic use of ‘tend to’, for instance) with a collegial tone (the awareness of the face of others), with a clear perception of what the thesis has contributed.

A different voice is evident in the following extract, which is the final paragraph from the conclusions chapter to a psychology thesis:

The results of this thesis serve both to reinforce the findings of previous workers and to provide new and comprehensive data on several areas of the ecology of mixed-species groups of saddleback and moustached tamarins. In particular, the present study showed for the first time, that the amount of time that the two species spent in association varied between months. The tamarins spent significantly less time in association in July, August and September. This was linked to a decrease in the availability of food resources, and the ability of the moustached tamarins to monopolise what little there was. During such periods the saddlebacks may have been left with little option but to forage independently of their larger congeners. This is contrary to the predictions of Norconk (1990), who suggested that troop fission would occur intraspecifically at times of food stress. Further long term research on mixed-species groups of tamarins, in different habitats, is required to investigate stability of mixed-species groups of tamarins with respect to seasonal variation in the availability of food and other resources.

This writer does not mitigate criticism, stating baldly that his research shows that Norconk’s prediction was wrong. At the same time, he is at pains to recognize the contributions of previous workers (which, by implication, identifies the writer as a ‘worker’ too) in the study of these groups of tamarins. He also makes clear assertions about the novelty of his work in providing comprehensive data on the subject of the thesis, and the finding that the two groups of tamarins associate to varying degrees at different times of the year. In closing, he presents a clear statement of what investigations further researchers need to undertake in this area.

Both writers perform an important conventional move at the end of their thesis, that of indicating the contribution of their research and stating that the findings refute the hypothesis of a previous researcher. The move is performed in different ways, though: one writer is circumspect in her assertion while the other is direct. Both appear to be successful and authoritative, but they also manage to convey a different impression. Put another way, they project different voices. As Hyland (2010: 162) argues, ‘individual agency is not eliminated by the cultural authority of convention’, and both writers manage to project voices that establish their own individual identity while showing some respect for disciplinary norms. Hyland describes this as ‘positioning’ – the establishment of one’s stance within community conventions.

Some thesis writers, however, choose not to adhere to convention. As Starfield and Ravelli (2006) demonstrate, the task of establishing a voice of authority in a qualitative research thesis may be quite different. In such theses, academic writing may be viewed as inhabited by the presence of the writer and of other writers in explicit dialogue. This can lead to much higher levels of writer visibility in the text, manifested, for example, through use of first person pronouns. The challenges of writing a qualitative thesis for a second language writer are discussed in depth by Phan Le Ha (2009), and an indication of the unconventionality of the thesis in her case study is that the student chose to include a poem exploring his experience and his identity in the conclusion chapter of his thesis (see the appendix to Phan Le Ha, 2009). In an extreme (and celebrated) instance, the writer of a sociology thesis openly flouts convention: the opening chapter of Malcolm Ashmore’s thesis on the sociology of scientific knowledge (later published as Ashmore, 1989) is written in the form of a transcript of an imaginary lecture in which the author is the lecturer, and the inquisitive student at the back of the classroom is his advisor. While the style of writing is highly unconventional, the chapter does however fulfil a conventional role as an initial literature review (the lecturer presents the current state of theory and knowledge in his lecture) and presentation of the research question that the rest of the thesis will address.

# 4 Summary

In this chapter I have looked at a number of ways in which doctoral students establish a voice of authority in their theses. I have proposed a three-level model of ‘voice’ and ‘stance’, and argued that stance is an aspect of voice, as it contributes to the impression of the writer in the text. Starting from the level of the proposition, I demonstrated how thesis writers balance the use of attribution with the establishment of a dominant authorial voice in averred statements. Beyond the proposition, I discussed the use of metadiscourse to make explicit the relationship between propositions and also between sections, and then I finally looked at how thesis writers take on the mantle of authority and evaluate the contribution of their thesis, mingling idiosyncracy with convention in a combination that suits their purpose.

# 9 Undergraduate Understandings: Stance and Voice in Final Year Reports

Ken Hyland University of Hong Kong

The ability to evaluate one’s material and establish a connection with readers is now acknowledged to be a key feature of successful academic writing (Hyland, 2004; Swales, 2004). As other authors in this collection have noted, academic argument involves presenting a position on things that matter to a discipline and this expression of a point of view has to be accomplished in a context of certain community and genre conventions. These conventions simultaneously place constraints on individual expression and offer opportunities to carve out a personal position, and this is the domain of stance and voice (Atkinson, 2001; Biber, 2006). Both these terms address interpersonal aspects of language, concerned with how writers and speakers represent themselves and their ideas to particular interlocutors. Despite their importance, they are extremely complex concepts, variously defined and not always fully grasped by student writers, especially by those working in a foreign language. Following other analysts, I understand stance to refer to a writer’s rhetorically expressed attitude to the propositions in a text and voice as his or her attitude to a given community.

In line with Biber (2006) and Biber and Gray (this volume), I will argue that stance largely involves the writer’s expression of personal attitudes and assessments of the status of knowledge in a text and that voice, on the other hand, acknowledges the authorized ways of speaking as a community member (Hyland, 2012). We can see voice as more reader-oriented, concerning the use of a disciplinary-appropriate system of meanings by recognizing ‘how things are done’, whereas stance is more author-oriented, concerning how writers actually use these to say something new. Put simply, we do our best to adopt a community voice, which gives us the right to be heard, and an individual stance, which (we hope) gets us listened to. In this chapter I take up the issue of undergraduate understandings of the conventions which realize stance and voice by focusing on the ways Hong Kong students represent both their readers and themselves in their final year dissertations. To do so I operationalize notions of stance and voice by drawing on my model of stance and engagement (Hyland, 2005).

# Stance and voice in academic contexts

Although stance and voice are notoriously slippery ideas difficult to pull apart in practice, here I am using them in rather specific ways to refer to the linguistic resources writers draw on to show their understanding of both the local context of the here-and-now interaction (the context of situation) and the broader constraints of the wider community which influence that interaction (the context of culture) (Halliday, 1989). Their importance lies in the fact that we do not just say what we think and get it over with, but take care to design a text for particular recipients so that, as far as possible, it meets the rhetorical expectations, processing abilities and information needs of readers in our social groups. The arguments we make, the positions we take and the ways we try to connect and fit in with others, all contribute to the presentation of ourselves and so influence how others respond to us. Every text therefore provides writers with an opportunity to construct a disciplinary-aligned presence and shape a credible self. Writing is always embedded in wider social and discursive practices which carry assumptions about participant relationships and how these should be structured and negotiated.

How writers choose to evaluate their work is therefore underpinned by institutional and intertextual constraints which provide patterns for interaction. Such patterns assist understanding through mutual expectations: essentially writers must present themselves as competent individuals, expressing a point of view by means of a community recognized textual ‘voice’ to engage with readers in accepted ways. So writers evaluate others’ work, appraise their own, critique the literature and present their understandings influenced by the conventions and patterns of the genre they are participating in and the relationships these sanction. Conventions of voice thus establish the disciplinary context within which writers craft a stance to their claims, and the literature suggests a range of ways writers are able to do this (e.g. Hunston and Thompson, 2000; Hyland, 2005).

In academic contexts, a writer’s stance is most clearly expressed through the linguistic choices he or she makes in expressing personal judgements through attitude markers such as interesting, surprisingly and excellent, and by marking how certain they are about the veracity of statements using boosters such as always, definitely and as we all know to express certainty and hedges like perhaps, it is likely and might to withhold it. Voice, on the other hand, is much broader as it concerns the control of features which readers recognize as legitimate and authoritative: the ways writers structure arguments, negotiate claims, refer to a literature, and criticize prior work. I narrow these here to explore the most explicitly dialogic features, those through which writers recognize the presence of their readers to bring them into their texts (Hyland, 2005). These engagement features represent a writer’s efforts to actively pull readers along with their argument: focusing their attention, anticipating their objections and including them as discourse participants. They mark the presence of what Thompson (2001) calls the ‘reader-in-the-text’ and the most obvious indication of this occurs where writers refer to readers using personal pronouns, asking questions and directing them to some interpretation through imperatives and obligation modals.

It is important to add a word of caution here. Clearly writers can express a stance in any number of ways and almost any choice among related words can be read as an evaluation. Stance is often embedded in the reader’s ability to decode value-laden words and phrases peculiar to the discipline and so often this may escape the notice of the analyst who does not share the arcane understandings of the insider. These features do, however, say something about how writers understand themselves and their communities, and it is useful to compare their use across genres and communities of writers.

# Disciplinary convention and student access

While typically taken for granted as straightforward and unproblematic by subject tutors, not everyone has equal access to the conventional forms associated with a competent academic self (Lillis, 2001). Consequently they are unable to participate effectively in the valued ‘contextual spaces’ (Blommaert, 2005) of their communities, whether these be research articles, essays, dissertations, or whatever. The incongruence, abstraction and technicality of what Scollon and Scollon (1981) call the ‘essayist literacy’ practices of the academy are often a mystery to students, and particularly to those working in a foreign language.

First, this is partly because they have not been taught the features which express interpersonal aspects of language and so continue to see academic writing in English as impersonal and faceless. Perhaps unsurprisingly, EAP courses often focus on the ideational mode, which organizes our reasoning skills, to help students control how they convey statements about the world coherently and logically. When teachers encourage their students to think of their audience and to write with the interests, background knowledge and expectations of readers in mind, then the features are often treated piecemeal. There is little systematic attention given to how these features function to influence the interaction between writer, reader and text, or how they relate to the particular genre and discipline in which the student is working (Hyland, 2004). As a result, it is often unclear to students how they should adopt interactional and evaluative positions, anticipating readers’ expectations and responses to craft a persona and participate in what amounts to a virtual dialogue with them.

Second, notions of stance and voice, as much as the forms that express them, are socially variable. Students socialized in non-Anglo cultures have different conceptions of what it means to project an effective and credible point of view or the resources needed to do this. Adopting an appropriate academic voice to anticipate readers’ expectations and responses to what they write can be very difficult for writers who are not used to seeing writing as interactive or to imagining the interests and requirements of a potential audience. More than this, however, taking on an academic voice may not just feel unfamiliar, but alien. The ‘self’ that is inscribed in academic discourse is strange to newcomers and novices who often feel a conflict in the identity they are portraying using disciplinary-prescribed conventions.

Academic writing practices ask the writer to express a stance to their material in a voice which foregrounds disciplinary arguments and subject matter. This voice means adopting the guise of a rational, disinterested, asocial seeker of truth and this can appear both mysterious and alien to those educated in other cultures.

# An illustration: Hong Kong undergraduate reports

As an example, I want to discuss the use of these features in a 630,000 word corpus of 64 project reports written by final year (Year three) Hong Kong undergraduates and interviews with students in eight fields. The final year report is a major assessment genre in Hong Kong universities. It is the product of a supervised research project spanning an entire year, varying between 8000 and 13,000 words and carrying credit for two courses. The purposes of the projects are to enable students to apply theories and methods learned in their courses and to demonstrate an ability to conduct and present research for two examiners using the forms of the discipline. This is, then, an extremely high-stakes genre and is by far the most substantial and sustained piece of writing that students do in their undergraduate careers.

This corpus, together with a larger reference corpus of 1.3 million words from research articles in closely related disciplines, was searched for key features of stance and engagement as mentioned above. Altogether, over 320 items were searched and all examples individually checked to sift out those that, in context, were performing other functions. Obviously, meanings do not reside in the items themselves but how they are used in context, so that determining whether we can regard an instance of could as expressing possibility rather than, say, ability or permission, or whether an example of possible is referring to the writer’s assessments rather than contextual circumstances, requires a pragmatic interpretation of actual instances. Another consideration is that words and phrases can be used to attribute a stance to others, and so careful checking of concordance lines was necessary to ensure that they were being used as direct expressions of writer stance.

The corpus data were supplemented by a series of 45-minute focus group discussions with 23 final year students. The sessions were conducted as ‘discourse based interviews’ involving examinations of text extracts to explore what students believed writers had tried to achieve with specific choices, then moved to more general observations of language use in a semi-structured format of open-ended prompts to explore subjects’ impressions of academic conventions and their own rhetorical choices.

The frequency findings quantify the extent of dialogic interactions in the two corpora, suggesting that academic writing is not the impersonal monologue it is often depicted to be. Stance markers in particular were extremely common and occurred, on average, just over 200 times in each student report. This is, however, considerably less than in the

Table 9.1 Frequency of features (per 10,000 words)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Genre</td><td>Questions Reader</td><td>references</td><td>Directives Hedges Boosters Attitude Totals</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Student reports</td><td>3.8</td><td>5.5</td><td>11.6</td><td>62.1</td><td>88.4</td><td>60.6</td><td>232.0</td></tr><tr><td>Published articles</td><td>4.0</td><td>24.8</td><td>18.4</td><td>137.5</td><td>56.8</td><td>61.4</td><td>302.9</td></tr></table></body></html>

research articles, which contained some 30 per cent more items overall.   
Table 9.1 shows these comparisons.

The most marked differences are in references to the reader, which occurred four times more in the research papers, hedges, which occurred over twice as often, and boosters, which are far more frequent in the reports. Beyond the numbers, however, we find some interesting variations relating to deeper frames of reference. It would seem that novice and professional writers differ notably in their understandings of academic conventions in relation to stance and voice, although it is not terribly meaningful to make direct comparisons. But while these different genres have very different purposes and audience which shape writers’ choices in different ways, the study of parallel corpora can provide information about what different groups of language users actually do, revealing something of writers’ understandings and schemata. In this case they can help to throw light on student perceptions of academic conventions and how these reflect and construct a particular context, providing the background by which we can understand learner practices.

# Patterns of voice: some examples

Voice, as I have noted, points to the ways writers establish a relationship to his or her community of readers and so encompasses a potentially open set of features, those that members routinely expect to encounter. Here I focus on just three, reader pronouns, questions and directives, as among the most explicitly engaging rhetorical elements of authorial voice and ones which highlight marked differences across the two genres.

# Reader reference

Second person you and your are perhaps the most obvious way of referring to readers as they explicitly acknowledge the reader’s presence, but they occur only rarely in the student corpus. Students view these forms as altogether too personal and informal for academic writing and follow textbook and teacher advice to avoid it. My focus group participants had firm views about what is actually appropriate:

Science writing is neutral. I know my supervisor will read my project but I cannot talk to him like in the tutorial. I must just put down the facts without personal idea, just show that $I$ understand the books and that I follow the method. (Bio student)

In school we learn not to say $' I ^ { \prime }$ or ‘you’ in our essays. I can use these when I write to my friend, but you don’t see them in the formal essays I think. (Econ student)

Students tend to avoid the expression you, but they have no such misgivings about inclusive forms, which also dominate the professional texts. Inclusive pronouns were particularly common in the soft fields with over 70 per cent occurring in the social science and business reports, mirroring the patterns in the professional corpus and reflecting the greater importance of explicit interpretation and reader engagement found there. Here, drawing readers into the discussion helps them focus on the arguments themselves, rather than how the writer has processed and understood natural phenomena.

Some students sought to adopt a disciplinary voice and signal community understandings with the reader by identifying with them through the use of inclusive we, as in these examples:

(1) As Psychologists we know that no matter which approach we use to assess intelligence, we just focus on one aspect only: mental, biological or anthropological. (SS)   
Over time, we might expect that good grammar teaching will facilitate self-error correction of the learners. (TESL)

But generally they were reluctant to use this form, with its assertions of a shared disciplinary membership with the reader and implications of equality. We pronouns carry authority by suggesting an equivalent level of knowledge and this is generally regarded as a risky strategy. As some students noted:

I cannot tell my supervisor to that he must think this or that. My idea may be wrong and not what my supervisor believes. He might have a different idea. (IS student)

I must be careful when I write. I don’t want to make myself important. Of course it is my project and my result, but I am just an ordinary student. Not an academic scholar with lots of knowledge and confident for myself. (TESOL student)

The genre constraints of the undergraduate project report contrast markedly with the assumptions of rhetorical equality found in peer-targeted research papers and, despite tutors’ attempts to model similarities with the article, the report is far more an assessment genre than a research one. It therefore asks students to demonstrate an appropriate degree of rhetorical sophistication while recognizing readers’ greater knowledge of the field and power to evaluate their text. A more common use of we was therefore to include a wider audience altogether, making statements which claimed a universal acceptance rather than disciplinary understandings. These students chose to engage readers less personally by invoking a world of common-sense activity and suggesting a shared general knowledge with them:

(2) So, we can not only find Playstation in those big chain stores and those individual game stores, but also in supermarkets as well. (BS) As our society needs literate and mathematically people who are literate and educated, a multimedia educational system on Mathematics is proposed. (IS)

Here writers take positions which any reasonable, thinking person might know or do, not appealing to teachers alone and claiming the confidence of an equal.

# Directives

The most frequent devices used to initiate reader participation in the student texts, comprising 45 per cent of all features, were directives. These are, most usually, imperatives, obligation modals or adjectives expressing necessity, which instruct the reader to perform an action or to see things in a way determined by the writer (Hyland, 2002a). These explicitly recognize the dialogic aspect of argument by directing the reader to some action or understanding:

(3) Firstly, assume that people with higher creative efficacy score equivalent to people of high creativity. (SS)   
See Table 2 for the comparison with secondary school teachers. (TESOL)   
It is important to note that those explanation are limited to their coatings tested. (IS)

The student reports contained only about half the number of directives found in the articles (per 10,000 words), again suggesting writers’ sensitivity to readers. Since reports are written mainly to gain credit for a research project, and not to establish the value of a contribution to knowledge, students see it as prudent to avoid a strategy which seeks to directly establish control over one’s reader. Two of my informants mentioned that they believed this kind of authorial authority was inappropriate:

No, they are only for the method section. It is too strong to use them in the discussion. (ME interview)

I never use ‘must’ or tell to ‘notice’ or ’consider’. These words are too strong. It is like a demand and I cannot demand my supervisor to agree with me. (IS interview)

However, while directives can work to construct power differences by leading readers through a line of reasoning and steering them to certain conclusions, what I have called cognitive acts (Hyland, 2002a), they also perform less threatening functions. They can also function to guide readers to another part of the text or to another text using textual acts or instruct them how to carry out some action in the real world through physical acts. Clearly a directive used to guide readers through a text or instruct them to perform a research procedure in a certain way assumes less authority and command over readers than telling them how to understand a point. As a result, the students were not only more reluctant to use a directive than research writers, but were far less likely to use the more imposing ones, as Table 9.2 shows.

We can see that almost half the directives in the research papers sought to position readers by leading them to understand an idea or data in a certain way, whereas student writers overwhelmingly employed directives to steer readers through research procedures. Interestingly, 90 per cent of these research-focused directives occurred in the hard sciences, perhaps influenced by the traditions of precision and highly formalized argument structures in these fields. This use is also favoured by authors of science textbooks, which students seemed to adopt as their models for the methods sections of their reports:

(4) Then a criterion function for comparing wear resistance performance must be taken into account. (Bio)

Test results should be recorded and reported using the standard test report format. (IS)

Table 9.2 Overall functions of directives by genre $( \% )$   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Genre</td><td>Textual</td><td>Physical</td><td>Cognitive</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Reports</td><td>21.3</td><td>58.3</td><td>20.4</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Articles</td><td>36.3</td><td>15.4</td><td>48.3</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

Rigidly mount the sample material in a manner appropriate for your microscope. (ME)

The students saw this relatively cautious use as a conventional means of describing procedures with no face-threatening implications:

Yes, I use ‘should’ here to show how $I$ tested the programme. It is like this in the textbook, I think. This is how we have to describe our work in the report. It is just normal, saying how anyone can do this not just us. (IS interview)

In engineering we must be clear in describing our method so it can be easily followed. If we are direct then it can be done by another person without problems. I am only reporting what I did and how the method needs to be. It is a general procedure. (ME interview)

In sum, the reports contained far fewer of the more imposing uses of directives as these students hesitated to direct their supervisors to particular views.

# Questions

The final example of authorial voice I want to mention is that of direct questions. While pedagogic texts often caution learners to avoid them, questions can nevertheless help writers create a sense of immediacy and engagement with the reader.

Questions perform several functions in academic writing and can have a different authoritative impact from the naïve puzzlement of limited knowledge to the confident anticipation of reaching an answer. They always, however, invite direct collusion because the reader is addressed as someone with an interest in the issue raised by the question, the ability to recognize the value of asking it, and the good sense to follow the writer’s response (Hyland, 2002b). They presuppose and mark the presence of the reader, whose attention is captured and selectively focused on key points in the writer’s argument. The frequencies of questions, broadly similar in the two corpora, were confined almost entirely to the soft disciplines and were mainly rhetorical. That is, they seemed to invite the reader into the discourse but actually anticipated the writer’s immediate response:

(5) However, in such a short period as one year, Sony’s Playstation has won world sales of over 10 million units. Why? Because Sony can catch up with the customers demands. (BS)

Are there any differences in the language learning between the class taught by conventional instruction and the one taught by a gameplaying method? The two classes of learners did not differ remarkably on tests of accuracy and communication. (TESOL)

There were, however, substantial differences in the ways experts and students used questions and not all student writers seemed comfortable with their directness and possible impact. Questions in the articles encouraged reader collaboration and served to express the writer’s familiarity with the discipline’s understandings and ways of establishing claims. The students, in contrast, seemed less certain about the effects of questions and tended to follow almost conversational uses. About half the student uses were yes/no forms (compared with 20 per cent of those in the articles) and mainly helped organize the discourse, especially by recycling research questions as section headings, as here:

(6) Chapter 2: How metal fatigue? (ME) Why choose zebrafish as model in this study? (Bio) Introduction: What is Pornography? (PA)

As with their use of reader reference and directives, these student writers were far less adventurous in their use of questions, perhaps anxious to avoid their potentially authoritative impact, as some of my interviewees mentioned:

I never think to ask a question in the report. How can I ask a question in my report? Teachers ask questions and I am answering the questions. I think my supervisor doesn’t want me to ask him questions but to answer questions. I leave it out. (Bio interview)

I don’t see questions in the journals. Are they OK to use? They are personal, for friends and in class. The teacher asks questions not students, but research questions must be in the report. That is normal. (ME interview)

So while questions can be an important resource to bring readers into the argument as participants, the students generally chose to avoid exploiting the full range of engagement functions these forms offer.

# Patterns of stance: expressing commitments and attitudes

In addition to acquiring the command of an ‘idiom’, or mastery of a community repertoire through which to construct relationships with readers, writers also draw on these resources to express a distinctive point of view, a personal ‘take’ on what is being discussed. Principally, communicating a stance, or a relationship to what is said, involves commenting on the status and value of ideas using hedges and boosters to communicate the degree of certainty and commitment towards a proposition, and attitude markers to refer to judgements of ‘quality’. To be effective, writers need to make claims and assertions which academic readers judge to be warranted and which reflect suitable social interactions and convey attitudes which reveal an understanding of appropriate academic and disciplinary values.

# Hedges and boosters

Much has been written on the use of these features in the expression of stance in academic writing (Hyland, 1998; Biber, 2006), as they communicate our assessments of epistemic distinctions and allow us to express statements from a particular perspective. They are realized grammatically, through clauses (e.g. as we all know, it is doubtful that…), or lexically through words like definitely, might, likely, etc. and by phrasal forms (seems obvious that, may be due to). They are, then, devices which either invest statements with the confidence of reliable knowledge or withhold complete commitment to imply that a claim is based on the author’s plausible reasoning rather than certain knowledge. Both options represent an author’s explicit intrusion into a text to convey a personal assessment on what is being written about.

The ability to express doubt and certainty appropriately in English is a complex task for language learners and, as Table 9.1 indicates, students were far less likely to hedge their statements than the experts. These results contrast with studies of native English speaking students (e.g. Hyland and Milton, 1997) and with interview data on student preferences (e.g. Ivanic, 1998; Lillis, 2001). Many of these L1 students said that they wanted to feel personally connected to their texts, but that the conventions of academic discourse prevented them from doing this. Basically, it was the impersonality of academic writing which frustrated the expression of personal views and left no space for a meaningful stance to what they were writing about. A recurrent issue in these narratives is the feeling of relinquishing their personal authority by anonymizing their writing. They forfeit what they feel to be their ‘authentic’ identity to talk like a book. The Hong Kong students, on the other hand, sacrificed precisely those features which most clearly allow them to individualize their take on matters.

Several studies have commented on the complexity of modal devices for learners who may be confused by either the delicacy of epistemic distinctions or the appropriate relations which these help construct with readers (see Hyland, 1998). An additional consideration for these writers, however, seems to be a desire to present their work in a direct and confident style. This example is typical (boosters underlined):

(7) There is strong evidence to demonstrate the relationship between EQ and the academic performance. High EQ is definitely an advantage in any domain of life and we all know that a person with high EQ can certainly manage their own feelings well and deal effectively with others. The fact that the trend from overseas is always affecting Hong Kong people means that schools must now teach boys to be equal to female. They have their right to express emotion. (SS)

The generous peppering of boosters in this example conveys a clear and confident stance which contrasts sharply with the more measured and cautious tone of research papers (hedges underlined):

(8) Although it seems that some group II introns are spliced efficiently under physiological conditions only if aided by trans-acting factors, it remains plausible that others may actually self-splice in vivo. Our results indicate that the splicing of nearly every pre-mRNA intron in the maize chloroplast genome requires either chloroplast ribosomes or crs2 function. The splicing of this intron may require nuclear gene products not yet identified in our genetic screens. Alternatively, this intron may self-splice in vivo. (Bio article)

This more tentative stance is a feature of mature academic writing and a clear signal of insider membership and disciplinary identity. Peer engagement requires the cultivation of a rhetorical relationship of personal humility and interactional equality, conveying respect for colleagues and opening a space for alternative views. The stance is softened to construct a pseudo-dialogue with readers in order to gain their acceptance of the argument. Such interactional and epistemic nuances appear secondary to presenting a clear attitude to one’s material in the student texts, and indeed, the students believed that they were expected to present an authorial commitment to the work:

This is the way to write essays in English. We have to be straight to the point and present our ideas in clear language or we might lose marks. I am told to keep it simple so my argument is not lost in words. (Bus interview)

My supervisor expects me to present my own argument and not just repeat what I find in textbooks. This is my study and I have to be sure of the results before I write about them so I am firm. (Soc sci interview)

This firmness therefore represents a somewhat marked stance in academic writing and may appear rather over-assertive and perhaps even dogmatic to readers familiar with research articles. For the students themselves, however, it is an entirely appropriate way of engaging with their work, representing both the kinds of stance they are familiar with in their everyday, conversational discourse and what they believe is required when writing in English.

# Attitude markers

The expression of overt affect, largely achieved through attitude verbs (agree, prefer), adverbials (unfortunately, surprisingly) and complement clauses (we hope that), encodes a positive or negative value to propositions. This is an important means of communicating a stance and in academic writing it is frequently expressed through the grading of ideational content, particularly the force by which writers convey their attitudes towards results or entities. Once again, the choice of attitude expressions for academics is constrained and shaped by disciplinary practice. Being intrinsically persuasive, it is a means of demonstrating involvement with colleagues by positioning oneself in terms of disciplinary values to express a community-ratified stance. These students, on the other hand, drew on a much broader range of markers and used them to express stronger emotions.

The overall frequencies of attitude markers are comparable to those in the research article corpus and both sets of writers overwhelmingly favoured interesting and important as preferred terms. The undergraduates, however, often accessed the more extreme end of the value scale, adding somewhat more emotive evaluations to amplify what Martin and White (2005) refer to as appreciation than is often customary in academic genres:

(9) The percentage of people being positive to the toll ring had increased unbelievably from $3 0 \%$ to $4 6 \%$ between 1989 to 1998. It was stunning that the percentage being very negative had decreased from $4 0 \%$ to $1 8 \%$ during the same period. (SS)   
The remarkable inertness of the nitrido function in technetium complexes towards proton-active reagents permits an extraordinarily wide variety of substitution reactions. (Bio)

With tremendous increase in the usage of Internet (Table 7), the world will truly be wired with wonderful electronic information in the next decade. (BS)

Obviously these students are unafraid to express a clear stance towards the issues they discuss in their final year project reports, often drawing on items from everyday use to augment their involvement and strengthen their views. This kind of commitment seemed unremarkable to the students themselves:

It is a long project and I am very interested in the research. I want to show how interested I am in the study. (IS)

What I found is very new to me and I feel excited by this. I can try and tell my supervisor as he has spent so much time with me on this report. (Bus)

It does, however, contribute to a very different stance from that typically found in research articles where persuasion is accomplished by a more calculated and measured expression of attitude. Commenting on ideas and results is a central aspect of argument, and part of an academic’s competence is the ability to use positive or negative evaluations which reflect attributes valued by his or her community of readers. Such authorized conventions of stance are, then, often uncertain for students, and the ways they can reasonably intrude into their discourse to assert personal involvement and attitudes remain unclear.

# Conclusions

Stance and voice constitute central pragmatic features of academic discourse since they contribute not only to the writer’s construction of a text, but also of a rhetorical self. Voice is a collection of rhetorical devices recognized by a community which allows the writer to speak as a member of that community, bestowing on competent users the right to be heard and to have their ideas taken seriously. Stance is essentially about what the writer has to say: how he or she takes an attitude to the truth or value of what is presented. It is worth reminding ourselves, however, that the writing practices of the academy, so familiar and unnoticed to many insiders, are actually disciplinary-peculiar ways of representing both reality and individuals and can be something of a mystery to learners.

Academic writing differs massively from the ways we routinely see the world and students trying to find their way through higher education have not yet imbued its specialized conventions into their habitus. The forms of writing and speaking that have grown up around the disciplines are founded on participants suppressing their distinctive social and cultural identities to foreground disciplinary arguments and subject matter, taking ‘disciplinary validated’ stances rather than personal ones. To speak with authority in academic contexts students often feel that they must use another’s voice and another’s code, weakening their affiliations to their home culture and discourses to adopt the values and language of their disciplinary ones. The stance and voice devices employed by these students suggest an awareness of academic conventions, but also of the impact of institutional power and, perhaps, cultural preference.

The fact that students’ choices differ considerably from those of ‘expert writers’ in the expression of attitude markers and, in particular, the frequencies of reader references, hedges and boosters, reveals how acts of writing are embedded in social and institutional practices, but also reflects how these writers construct their texts and themselves in this genre and in this culture. We can read these choices, then, as displaying something of the students’ perceptions of what comprises an appropriate stance in this assessment context. In arguing clearly for a position, projecting appropriate conviction and displaying a command of the material, these writers are concerned to demonstrate an appropriate degree of intellectual autonomy and authority while, at the same time, recognizing readers’ greater experience and knowledge of the field. The voices and stances they adopt therefore represent an understanding of both academic conventions in English and the exigencies of the context of situation. The wider culture and immediate context intrude into our communicative practices in significant ways, and the results presented here underline these social aspects of voice and stance.

# 10 Voice in Student Essays

Paul Kei Matsuda and Jill V. Jeffery Arizona State University and University of New Mexico

Voice in written language – a metaphorical concept capturing the sense of author identity that comes through when readers interact with texts – has intrigued many writing teachers and researchers. While some teachers regard voice to be an essential feature of good writing, others consider it to be unnecessary, if not distracting, especially in the context of academic and professional writing. One of the most obvious reasons for this discrepancy is the varied conception of voice. In the early years, voice was conceptualized in individualistic terms, focusing on the expression of authentic self (Elbow, 1968; Stewart, 1969, 1972). This perspective has often been at odds with social- constructionist views of voice that emphasize the normative aspects of language use (Cope and Kalantzis, 1993; Hyland, 2008). There are more recent, social- constructivist conceptions of voice that see individual and social voice to be mutually constitutive and inevitable (Ivanicˇ, 1998; Ivanicˇ and Camps, 2001; Matsuda, 2001; Prior, 2001). Studies using a socialconstructivist definition of voice (Matsuda, 2001) have shown that voice plays an important role in advanced academic literacy (Matsuda and Tardy, 2007; Tardy and Matsuda, 2009). Yet, as Tardy (this volume) has pointed out, the debate over the notion of voice has tended to be caught in a simplistic individual–social dichotomy.

Another important reason for the uncertainty of the role of voice in academic writing is how voice is measured. Helms-Park and Stapleton (2003) examined the relationship between the presence of voice and the overall effectiveness of student essays. They did not find a significant relationship between scores from the Voice Intensity Scale – which is designed to measure individual voice (assertiveness, self-identification, reiteration of central point, and authorial presence and autonomy of thought) – and scores from the ESL Composition Profile, one of the most commonly used rubrics in second language writing. As Matsuda and Tardy (2007) pointed out, however, the results may have been due to the absence of voice in the criteria for ESL Composition Profile. This point has been confirmed by Zhao and Llosa (2008), who replicated Helms-Park and Stapleton (2003) but used a rubric that explicitly included voice. They found that the Voice Intensity Scale scores correlated with the scores from the holistic rubric for the New York State Regents Examination in English Language Arts, which includes the ‘sense of voice and awareness of audience and purpose’ (New York State Education Department, 2007: 3). It follows that the importance of voice – or any other aspect of writing for that matter – depends on what is being measured. As Haswell (2005: 110) has pointed out, ‘the criteria not chosen shape the outcomes as much as those that are chosen’.

To understand the role of voice in student essays, it is important to examine how student essays are being conceptualized and assessed at different levels of education. The goal of this chapter, then, is to investigate how voice has been incorporated into the assessment of student essays at various levels of education by taking a close look at curriculum guidelines and assessment rubrics, using US secondary and postsecondary education as examples. We must note, however, that the notion of ‘student essay’ is a contested one. Aside from the popular and literary senses of ‘essay’ as assayer (attempt), the term ‘essay’ has been used in educational contexts in various ways. In some cases, the term is synonymous with ‘paper’ – a term that is itself open-ended. In other contexts, ‘essay’ refers to a literary nonfiction genre that presents a perspective on any given topic using various literary devices. It may also refer to a highly conventionalized classroom genre – such as the five-paragraph essay – that has been perpetuated by writing textbooks and standardized assessments. In this ‘essay’, we use the term not in reference to the physical manifestations of essays. The term ‘essay’ in this context refers not to any specific genre but to a constellation of genres – personal, academic, professional, political and literary – that make a point and develop it by drawing on various discursive resources associated with each genre. In other words, it refers broadly to the essence of ‘essayness’ – the rather ill-defined yet socially shared construct that has been reified by educational and assessment practices in secondary and postsecondary education in the United States.

To get at the representation of voice in the idealized conceptions of student essays, we analyze the extent to which voice and voice-related concepts are emphasized in curriculum guidelines and in rubrics for the assessment of high school and university student essays in the United States. Although we recognize that curricular goals and rubrics do not necessarily capture the entire range of instructional goals that are instantiated in various classrooms, we contend that they do provide representations of widely shared and influential notions of writing competence (Applebee, 2011; Hillocks, 2002). Examining rubrics is also relevant because the importance of voice is related to which rubric happens to be used (Haswell, 2005; Zhao and Llosa, 2008). Another reason for examining the rubrics is the washback effect they create (Weigle, 2006); if the rubrics include voice in their criteria, they will increase the likelihood of teachers and students valuing voice as an important concept. After all, the literacy tasks assigned in schools are too often ‘determined by what will be assessed on high stakes standardized tests’ (Allison, 2009: 83).

# 1 Voice in student essays: US postsecondary education

In US higher education, a majority of writing instruction takes place in the context of first-year composition – the one- or two-semester requirement that forms the core of general education at most institutions (Knoblauch and Matsuda, 2008). While the requirement is ubiquitous, there are no government-sanctioned, nationwide guidelines for the first-year writing curriculum. Instead, writing programs – at least those directed by professional writing program administrators – tend to follow the guidelines set forth by the WPA Outcomes Statement for First-Year Composition (Council of Writing Program Administrators, 2000), a document that articulates what students need to practice before they complete the first-year composition requirement. The statement (which may more accurately be described as curriculum guidelines than a statement about outcomes) was developed in the late 1990s by a group of writing teachers from across the United States. It was first adopted in 2000 by the Council of Writing Program Administrators, a professional organization for those who direct writing programs. Since then, the WPA Outcomes Statement has had a strong impact on writing programs throughout the United States. As White (2006: 111) has noted, the document ‘seems to have struck a chord that resonates throughout the profession’.

The major categories included in the Outcomes Statement are: rhetorical knowledge; critical thinking, reading and writing; processes; knowledge of conventions; and composing in electronic environments. The first category, ‘rhetorical knowledge’, states that, ‘by the end of first year composition, students should’:

focus on a purpose• respond to the needs of different audiences•

respond appropriately to different kinds of rhetorical situations   
use conventions of format and structure appropriate to the rhetorical   
situation   
adopt appropriate voice, tone, and level of formality   
understand how genres shape reading and writing   
write in several genres

As you can see, the term ‘voice’ appears in the list of what needs to be addressed in the first-year composition course. Although the document does not explicitly define voice, the choice of the adjective ‘appropriate’ rather than ‘authentic’ leaves open the possibility of appropriate voice in academic and professional writing, which seems to suggest that the underlying conception of voice is not limited to individual voice. The verb ‘adopt’ seems to indicate that the conception of voice underlying this statement is social-constructionist rather than social-constructivist in nature.

Given the inclusion of voice as one of the desired outcomes of firstyear composition courses, and given the impact the WPA Outcomes Statement has had on the field of writing program administration, it would be reasonable to assume that voice is, or should already be, one of the stated goals of many first-year composition programs in US higher education. Yet, assessment tools that are commonly being used in higher education do not include voice as a category of its own nor do they integrate voice into other categories. For example, TOEFL iBT rubrics (Educational Testing Service, 2008) stipulate that an essay at the highest level (Score 5):

effectively addresses the topic and task•   
is well organized and well developed, using clearly appropriate• explanations, exemplifications, and/or details   
displays unity, progression and coherence•   
displays consistent facility in the use of language, demonstrating• syntactic variety, appropriate word choice, and idiomaticity, though it may have minor lexical or grammatical errors

The term ‘voice’ is absent in this description, and the concept does not seem to be implied in any of the categories. Similarly, IELTS Task 1 Writing Descriptor (International English Language Testing System, n.d.) provides the following criteria for the highest level (Band 9), and none of the descriptors seem to address voice:

fully satisfies all the requirements of the task; clearly presents a fully• developed response (Task Response)

uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention; skilfully [sic] manages paragraphing (Coherence and Cohesion)   
uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features; rare minor errors occur only as ‘slips’ (Lexical Resources)   
uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy; rare minor errors occur only as ‘slips’ (Grammatical Range and Accuracy)

Likewise, the term ‘voice’ is absent from the ESL Composition Profile (Jacobs et al., 1981), which includes the following descriptors at the highest level:

CONTENT: knowledgeable; substantive; thorough development of thesis; relevant to assigned topic   
ORGANIZATION: fluent expression; ideas clearly stated/supported; succinct; well organized; logical sequencing; cohesive   
VOCABULARY: sophisticated range; effective word/idiom choice and usage; word form mastery; appropriate register   
LANGUAGE USE: effective complex constructions; few errors of agreement, tense, number, word order/function, articles, pronouns, prepositions   
MECHANICS: demonstrates mastery of conventions; few errors of spelling, punctuation, capitalization, paragraphing

The tendency not to include the term ‘voice’ is not limited to writing assessment rubrics designed for L2 writers; rubrics used in standardized tests – which are designed to measure college readiness and are used for college admissions and even for placement into first-year composition courses – also do not include voice as part of their criteria. For example, the descriptors for the highest level (Score 6) in the SAT Essay Scoring Guide (College Board, 2011) include the following:

effectively and insightfully develops a point of view on the issue and   
demonstrates outstanding critical thinking, using clearly appropriate   
examples, reasons and other evidence to support its position   
is well organized and clearly focused, demonstrating clear coherence   
and smooth progression of ideas   
exhibits skillful use of language, using a varied, accurate and apt   
vocabulary   
demonstrates meaningful variety in sentence structure   
is free of most errors in grammar, usage and mechanics

Similarly, the ACT Writing Plus (ACT, 2011) and Advanced Placement (AP) Language and Composition exam rubrics (College Board, 2010) do not include the term ‘voice’. At a more advanced level, the GRE Analytic Writing exam rubric also does not incorporate voice (Educational Testing Service, 2011).

As we have seen, the concept of voice is not included in the writing rubrics that are used at the college level, even though it is mentioned in the WPA Outcomes Statement, the only nationwide curriculum guidelines for first-year composition programs in US higher education. We do not mean to suggest from this circumstantial evidence that voice is not valued in the actual writing classroom or that it is not included in classroom writing assessment. In fact, the expressive orientation to writing, which emphasizes individual voice and personal genres over transactional and rhetorical genres, still remains popular among some writing teachers (Fulkerson, 2005). If that is the case, however, the absence of voice in writing assessment rubrics is even more puzzling.

# 2 Voice in student essays: US secondary education

In US high schools, most of the scant writing instruction that students receive occurs in English language arts courses (Applebee, 2011; Applebee and Langer, 2006), which students are typically required to take each year of secondary schooling. Assessments of writing have increasingly become a part of US states’ English language arts exams, and these typically take the form of a prompt designed to elicit an extended ‘essay’ response. Currently, US states apply a heterogeneous approach to assessment wherein the majority of states administer their own exams. Writing assessments included in these exams vary in terms of the notions of writing proficiency they represent ( Jeffery, 2009), as do the state curricular guidelines to which the assessment criteria are linked (Jeffery, 2007).

In contrast to the situation at the postsecondary level, the notion of voice – though variously defined – has long been incorporated into state-mandated high-school curriculum guidelines as well as rubrics that are being used to evaluate student achievement through statewide writing assessments. In fact, voice appears as a learning objective for the vast majority (48 out of 50) of state curriculum guidelines for writing ( Jeffery, 2007). The prevalence of voice in state education policy documents suggests that it is widely considered to be an important construct for the teaching of writing at the high-school level in the United States.

The place of voice in the state curriculum is also reflected in the rubrics that are designed to assess whether students are meeting the learning objectives. A study of statewide writing assessment rubrics at the high-school level found that voice is included as a criterion in more than half of the US states that included writing assessments in their accountability programs ( Jeffery, 2009). The rubrics, however, embody various conceptions of voice. A content analysis of the 20 rubrics that included voice revealed that 10 of these emphasized voice as a standalone assessment category or in combination with related concepts such as tone and purpose, while the other 10 rubrics included them as part of the descriptors under categories such as ‘style’, ‘language use’, and ‘written expression’ ( Jeffery, 2010).

Representations of voice on state rubrics suggest complex, sometimes incoherent, theoretical notions of voice. Although the rubrics tend to measure voice in terms of its absence or presence, or appropriateness or inappropriateness – measures that are compatible with individualistic or constructionist understandings of voice – those rubrics typically do not present voice in ways that are completely consistent with any one of the three theoretical orientations (Matsuda, 2011; Tardy, this volume). Rather, most of the rubrics incorporate both individual and social dimensions of voice, often construing it as an amalgamation of authentic expression, distinct style, appropriate register, and reader–writer interaction. For example, several states (i.e., Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah) have adopted versions of the six-trait (Northwest Regional Education Laboratory, 2008) rubric, which includes voice as a third major category. A six-trait analytic rubric used to score student writing in Oregon and Arizona presents each of the six ‘traits’ separately, and indicates the following expectations for a score of 6 (the highest score) for voice (Oregon DOE, 2010a):

The writer has chosen a voice appropriate for the topic, purpose, and audience. The writer demonstrates deep commitment to the topic, and there is an exceptional sense of ‘writing to be read.’ The writing is expressive, engaging, or sincere. The writing is characterized by

an effective level of closeness to or distance from the audience (e.g., a narrative should have a strong personal voice, while an expository piece may require extensive use of outside resources and a more academic voice; nevertheless, both should be engaging, lively, or interesting. Technical writing may require greater distance.).

an exceptionally strong sense of audience; the writer seems to be aware of the reader and of how to communicate the message most effectively. The reader may discern the writer behind the words and feel a sense of interaction.   
a sense that the topic has come to life; when appropriate, the writing may show originality, liveliness, honesty, conviction, excitement, humor, or suspense.

Though the rubric initially indicates a constructionist orientation in emphasizing the choice of an ‘appropriate’ voice, an individualistic rendering (‘commitment’, ‘sincere’) quickly follows. Finally, the genre distinctions that elaborate the framing description suggest a constructionist approach to voice.

It is also important to note that secondary state standards emphasize voice to varying degrees and that they define voice inconsistently both within and between official documents that are frequently published on state department of education (DOE) websites. For example, of the 48 states that included voice in curriculum standards, six discussed criteria for voice narrowly as distinct style or as appropriate use of active and passive voice. Most state standards include more complex understandings of voice that indicate the ability to maneuver voice as a goal, as in ‘allowing voice to emerge when appropriate’ (Kentucky). Many curriculum guidelines also emphasize individualistic understandings of voice, such as the ability to ‘evaluate [one’s] own writing and others’ writing to highlight individual voice’ (Oklahoma).

There is ample evidence, as well, that voice is a central goal of writing instruction not just for state-mandated curricula but also in the minds of US secondary English language arts teachers. For example, voice has been identified as a prominent concern in research regarding secondary English language arts teachers’ writing evaluation criteria. The focal high-school teacher in Beck’s (2006: 433) study discussed his desire for his students ‘to become confident in their writing voice, that they have a voice, that they have something to say’. Further, an analysis of 19 interviews with experienced secondary English language arts teachers regarding the role of voice in writing assessment ( Jeffery, 2011) revealed how they embraced voice as an important but exceedingly complicated instructional goal. Similarly, Dipardo, Storms, and Selland (2011: 171) have discussed how, despite debates around its viability as an assessment criterion, National Writing Project teachers ‘continue to regard ‘voice’ as elemental to successful writing’. Secondary English teachers’ preoccupation with voice is also apparent in its frequent appearance as a topic in professional practitioner literature, including English Journal articles regarding the cultivation of voice in student writing (Easton, 2005; Gillis, 2002; McHaney, 2004; Seglem and VanZant, 2010), and popular books aimed at practitioner audiences (Romano, 2004; Spandel, 2009).

# 3 Discussion and conclusion

As we have seen, the notion of voice, though variously defined, is prevalent in US secondary schools, as evidenced by its inclusion in curriculum guidelines and rubrics as well as teacher perceptions. In contrast, voice is conspicuously absent from standardized writing assessment rubrics that are used in higher education, even though it is included in the nationwide curriculum guidelines. Since curriculum guidelines for both levels of education include voice, it seems reasonable to conclude that it is the absence of voice in postsecondary rubrics that is out of line.

The gap between secondary and postsecondary contexts, in terms of how voice is valued, taught and assessed, has an important implication for second language writers – especially international students who have not been exposed to US secondary educational practices. Some researchers have argued that second language writers struggle with the notion of voice; they have explained the difficulties in terms of differing cultural orientations that these students bring (Ramanathan and Atkinson, 1999; Ramanathan and Kaplan, 1996). Matsuda (2001), however, has shown that individual voice is not absent in languages that are often stereotypically associated with so-called collectivist cultures, and has proposed an alternative explanation: the difficulties in constructing voice may stem from the different ways in which voice is constructed in different languages. The analysis in this chapter presents yet another possibility – the lack of previous exposure to voice instruction. While students who went through secondary education in the United States are more likely to have internalized the value of voice in written discourse and may have even received specific instruction and feedback on how to construct it, international students who have recently arrived are less likely to have received such instruction. If that is the case, it follows that teaching voice in the college composition course is important in helping students learn the values that are associated with US literacy practices.

One question that remains is why voice is not addressed in writing assessment rubrics that are commonly used in US higher education. Those who subscribe to the social-constructionist view of voice may be tempted to argue that it is due to the difference between personal writing and academic writing. That is, they might surmise that writing at the secondary level is more personal while writing at the postsecondary level is more academic. Yet, this explanation does not seem to stand because the vast majority of writing assessments used on the high-school level emphasize analytic exposition and persuasive writing ( Jeffery, 2009). Furthermore, studies have shown that voice is evident even at the most advanced level of academic writing – writing journal articles (Matsuda and Tardy, 2007; Tardy and Matsuda, 2009). There are a number of more likely explanations.

One possible explanation is the rhetorically situated nature of the writing task. In both secondary and postsecondary education contexts, the curricular guidelines emphasize the importance of the rhetorical situation, which results from the interplay of its constituent elements: the writer, the reader, the subject, the purpose, and the genre (Council of Writing Program Administrators, 2000; Jeffery, 2007). Because voice is a phenomenon that emerges in a particular rhetorical situation, it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess voice without reference to those contextual factors. However, large-scale standardized assessments developed far from the context of their use tend to rely only on what is in the text itself rather than incorporate assumptions about the rhetorical situation implicit in the prompt or the real-life writing situations they purport to simulate.

In fact, even at the high-school level, more recent writing assessment rubrics and curricular guidelines that are designed for national use tend not to include the notion of voice. For example, the notion of voice was recently removed from the National Writing Project Analytic Writing Continuum because of the difficulty of assessing rhetorically such situated concepts; instead, it was replaced with stance, which is more easily assessed based on the textual evidence alone (DiPardo et al., 2011). Similarly, the Common Core Standards, new nationwide standards that have been adopted by 46 states at the time of drafting this chapter (National Governors Association, 2011), do not include voice in the writing standards for any grade level or in any subject area (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2010).

Another, closely related explanation for the gap between secondary and postsecondary approaches to voice in rubrics, is the proximity of the assessment to the classroom context. On the one hand, writing rubrics designed for nationally or internationally administered standardized assessments are removed not only from the immediate context of the rhetorical situation but also from the classroom context. On the other hand, secondary rubrics are statewide (rather than nationwide) assessments, reflecting the local values of the teachers as well as the statewide standards more closely.

That is, a student who writes an essay for a US statewide exam will likely do so in the familiar context of his or her school, whereas a student writing an essay for a nationwide assessment will do so in an unfamiliar setting. Similarly, in contrast to national assessments, state assessments are designed locally. For example, when the Oregon Department of Education developed standards for student achievement in academic subjects, such as the English language arts standards that we have examined here, the committee relied ‘on extensive input from Oregon educators and other members of the educational community, including members of professional organizations, district administrators, postsecondary institutions, and other community members’ (Oregon DOE, 2010b: 5). Testing tools that are designed to measure student progress toward meeting these Oregon standards, such as the Oregon rubric discussed above, have also been developed locally. It seems that the greater the distance between the context within which a rubric is developed and the context within which it is used to assess writing, the less likely it is for the rubric to include voice regardless of whether teachers and curriculum guideline designers value the construct. This might explain why a rubric used to score writing on the California High School Exit Examination, which was developed by the Educational Testing Service, does not include voice – even though voice is included in that state’s curriculum guidelines for writing.

Yet another possible reason for the lack of alignment between voice on curricular guidelines and assessment rubrics in higher education involves the gap between theory and practice in writing assessment. For example, whereas writing assessments have only recently become a staple of statewide high-school exams, prototypes for college-level large-scale assessment were developed in the 1980s – before the rhetorical approach to writing became firmly established in the United States. The notion of voice discussed in composition theory at the time was also limited; in the 1980s, the individualistic notion of voice that was pervasive in the writing classroom was only beginning to receive critical attention (e.g. Hashimoto, 1987), and more robust conceptions of voice were yet to become available. Further, critiques of individual voice have largely been confined to the college composition scholarship, and these critiques are only recently making their way into discussions around writing assessment in secondary schools (e.g. DiPardo et al. 2011; Sperling and Appleman, 2011). With the availability of more robust, social-constructivist conceptions of voice (see Tardy, this volume), it may be time to reevaluate how voice can and should be incorporated into rubrics at all levels.

Although rubrics are necessarily limited in what they can capture, we do not mean to dismiss their usefulness altogether. They do provide useful ways of ensuring certain key constructs are being assessed consistently, and that certain features, such as grammar errors, are not dominating the assessment outcomes. Yet, the limitations of assessment rubrics are important to keep in mind in order not to let them drive the curriculum entirely. The writing curriculum needs to be driven by well-informed and well-articulated curriculum guidelines that indicate what it is that students are to learn, which should in turn be grounded in an appropriate theory of writing to ensure construct validity. The place of voice in the writing curriculum, then, is not just an empirical question, because what is measured is limited by what can be measured and by how ‘good writing’ is conceived in the first place. Even needs analyses, which are often considered to be the starting point of developing language tests and curricula (Brown, 1995), are limited by what needs are conceived and identified. Instead, we need to work toward a more robust conception of writing that encompasses even those constructs that are not easily measured, including how author identity is constructed in written communication. In turn, those insights need to be reflected in the ongoing development of writing assessment rubrics – both local and large scale.

# 11 Proximal Positioning in Students’ Graph Commentaries

Carmen Sancho Guinda Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain

Visual data pervade disciplines and genres. Graphs, diagrams and tables illustrate and complement verbal contents in textbooks, exams, research articles or class notes across the academic field and may even stand as independent texts, especially in the hard sciences. Despite this ubiquity, however, the receptive and productive abilities they involve are acquired disjointedly and intuitively. We learn how to decode graphics during the early high school years (Myers, 2003), along with the language of the specific subjects and texts in which they are embedded, but normally do not verbalize them until later at university, if not once in the professional arena. This is the plight of many Spanish graduates. Technology people, in particular engineers, do not need to interpret visuals unless they interact with other communities of practice (Wenger, 1998) for whom the graphic information presented is abstruse or alien to their shared repertoires.

This chapter makes the case for explicit instruction on graph commentaries in higher education. Such a claim is supported by the analysis of stance and voice in samples produced by my aeronautical engineering students at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), whose expectations about the academic register and the communicative classroom situation lead them to engage in low-stance and highengagement writing. I will argue that the strategies they deploy to craft an academic voice, and thus align with teachers, may paradoxically end up in misalignment, in what could be called frustrated proximity. Before describing this pragmatic failure, though, I would like to outline the communal and generic features at play and my own conceptions of stance and voice.

# 1 The graph commentary as a borderline genre

The inclusion of graph accounts in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and academic literacy programmes is justified by three major facts: firstly, they are an integral part of scientific and abstract thought (Latour, 1986). Secondly, they are essential tasks among the graduate student competencies (Swales and Feak, 2004). And thirdly, they are also key argumentative devices (Fletcher and Hargreaves, 1980) in the ‘restrained persuasion’ noted by Sales (2006) as idiosyncratic of the hard sciences and mostly of engineering communication – a factual and objective type of writing based on empirical evidence. Together with these fundamentals, the teaching of graph commentaries is convenient because of the liminality inherent to this type of texts, which relates to its channels, content and verbalization procedure, and may hamper autonomous learning. To begin with, the verbal and the visual are symbiotic and generate a ‘non-linear reading’ (Johns, 1998) or ‘primitive hypertext’ (Lemke, 1998) that demands metadiscursive competence to guide the reader. Graph commentaries also require the handling of objective data and subjective information, and a combination of creativity and heuristic training.

Some questions arise as to the last two premises: Can we deem all talk about graphs commentaries? Is every graph description a genre? Where should we draw the line? The unstable rhetorical structure of graph accounts and its ensuing lack of unified models confer on them an unconventional discursive status I qualify as borderline between genre and skill. Writer choices seem to span a cline of stance (embodied in subjectivity and creativity) between the extremes of mere paraphrase of data or data transfer (Swales and Feak, 1997) and interpretation (i.e. commentary) encompassing explanation, hypothesis, prediction and the application to (or the analogy with) different contexts. The graded possibilities are collected in the continuum of Figure 11.1, along which we may move from redundant translations of the visuals into prose to more creative ones rearranging the data and to explanatory and forecasting interpretations. I have set a fuzzy boundary between transfers and commentaries in the reorganization of data, subjective enough to be separated from transfers but not sufficiently staged for a genre.

From a systemic-functional standpoint, the commentary of visuals can be considered a (macro) genre given its pervasiveness, its agglutination of other texts called ‘genres’ by the systemic-functionalists – such as recounts, expositions and discussions (Martin and Rose, 2003: 345) – and its goal-oriented and staged nature, although neither researchers nor users seem to have achieved a consensus on what those stages are. Bertin (1981), Olsen and Huckin (1991) and Swales and Feak (2004) have detected a minimum of two rhetorical moves and a maximum of five, basically consisting of grouping, highlighting and discussing data. The ESP tradition could in principle catalogue graph commentaries as either embedded (Bhathia, 1997) or flexible genres (Paltridge, 2002), but they do not belong to a clear-cut community of practice (a foremost genre requisite in ESP) as they straddle the academic and professional domains.

Figure 11.1 Stance cline for graph accounts

The community constituted by my students is likewise one difficult to demarcate, despite being rooted in an academic setting. Their technical expertise and knowledge of genres are heterogeneous, and their discoursal resources still far from the restrained ways of full-fledged engineers. We will see that instead they tend to build an interpersonal relationship with the reader based on emotion and conversational features, while simultaneously trying to ape academic formality and even the colloquial tone of a certain type of textbook to sound pedagogic. These characteristics, which learners might think part of a monolithic academic style, place them in a ‘no-man’s-land’ where the disparate moves they display also suggest diverse degrees of exposure to visual data commentaries and little familiarity with the routines of their future disciplinary culture.

# 2 Stance, voice and the rendering of visual data

Throughout this chapter I will draw on an eclectic notion of voice, amalgamating its traditional view as a set of lexico-grammatical, rhetorical and topical features or writer choices (Clark and Ivanicˇ, 1997; Hyland, 2008; Petric´, 2010) and as an effect on the reader (Matsuda, 2001, 2011; Matsuda and Tardy, 2007) caused by those traits. In my students’ case, the indiscriminate imitation of features from academic writing and the communicative language teaching of English (henceforth AW and CLT respectively) seem to create the failed proximal positioning or frustrated proximity mentioned above. Example 1 (emphases mine) is an exponent of that mingle of registers, with an abbreviated academic Latinism and informal vague language:

(1) Channel 4 is seen by many aged people and parents. This must have programmes of e.g. news, documentals and something like that.

By ‘positioning’ I understand the combination of stance and engagement devices (following Hyland’s 2005 and 2010 models) opted for by writers and situating readers, and ‘proximity’ denotes both the alignment attempted by complying with communal conventions (Hyland, 2010) and, more literally, the feeling of nearness induced by inclusive pronominal use, conversational style and personal disclosure – in contrast to the ‘distal’ or ‘restrained’ positioning of engineers.

Further, I subsume any writer choice in Blommaert’s (2005) broad definition of voice as ‘the capacity to make oneself understood’. My students’ endeavour ‘to make themselves understood’ responds to a perception of the commentary task not as a co-construction of meaning between teachers and learners but as a polarized social interaction (Goffman, 1971), as a gatekeeping encounter in which instructors (the gatekeepers) have the power to judge and penalize. Students, it will be shown, react to this circumstance by taking on situational voices (Ede, 1989) in search of alignment, those of AW and CLT they have absorbed from their didactic materials over the years. The outcome is a diglossic aggregate merging the two styles in tension. And adopting a style, as Jaffe (2009) points out, implies taking a stance.

At a finer level of delicacy, I conceive stance and engagement in a circular relationship because, if according to Stubbs (1986) explicitness is a form of commitment, then the expression of stance (be it overt or covert) is in itself an act of engagement: writers could simply let readers process the graphic data by themselves. Some cultures, in fact, are less prone to interpreting visuals than ours for fear that commenting on what is thought to be obvious could be taken as offensive to the interlocutor’s intelligence, as Swales and Feak (1997) report of Asian students. This omission of any interpretation and sorting of data is also a stance (indirect or covert) towards the addressee and his/her own community, which shapes that position and at the same time is moulded by it. The difference lies in that this Oriental stance neither materializes into verbal text nor does it engage with the reader, as it does not facilitate data comprehension.

Our Western pedagogical literature usually identifies the verbalization of graphs with the learning of vocabulary items and syntactic patterns useful to describe trends (e.g. ‘stagnation’, ‘upturn’, ‘to peak at’) and to some linguistic means to collocate them with expressions of overt stance (e.g. attitudinal adverbials, boosters, hedges and personal pronouns marking opinion). A number of EAP/ESP manuals do enumerate them, whereas the rhetorical and pragmatic facets of graph accounts have been exceptionally modelled by few titles (e.g. Fletcher and Hargreaves, 1980; Kerridge, 1992; Swales and Feak, 2004). These materials become valuable aids to Spanish teachers and learners, whose educational system seldom articulates the commentary of graphics, presumably in the belief that it is a sort of ‘tacit knowledge’ to be passed on ‘by doing’. Apparently writers are supposed to discover by themselves that the presence or absence of some rhetorical moves, often taught as strictly structural elements, is an instance of covert stance.

Data discussion, a move cardinal to interpretation, may at the most be shown to express stance overtly through an evaluation and explanation of data. In general, however, no connections are made between stance and other possible moves (i.e. framing of the graphic and data sorting and highlighting) nor with spatio-temporal perspectives, register shifts and metatextual references such as ‘to complete my exposition’ or ‘I will analyse’, which indicate a reflective awareness of the act of writing. This metatextuality differs from the ‘insider perspectives’ of fictional contexts, where the writer may include him/herself as an actor (e.g. ‘This is my opinion, from the Sales Department’). Whatever its surface pattern, in my samples stance is on the whole scarce and implicit, found more in how the data are arranged than in what is actually said about them. It is also ‘candid’, since students do not know they are communicating stance indirectly through that implicit fashion, while their guidance of the reader (i.e. engagement) when navigating back and forth from the visual to the verbal is strong and conscious. Hence my anticipation that students’ accounts are low-stance and high-engagement texts.

# 3 Methodology

Inspired by class observation, this study comprises mixed research methods – discourse based (i.e. interviews and conferencing) and corpus informed. To find out about the role and weight of graphics among my students, to whom I teach academic English and professional communication, I conducted semi-structured interviews with the faculties of Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science and Economics. I chose these departments because their subjects are taught from the first to the third years of any engineering degree at the UPM and graphics take up from 30 to 70 per cent of the class notes published by the reprography services. Usually these graphics are non-verbalized and may appear as independent texts or accompanied by meagre verbal legends in illustrative or complementary relationship with the visuals. Lab report booklets may easily contain 80 per cent of visuals and this proportion increases in the seminar and elective subject readings on aircraft and airport design for senior students.

Subsequently I scrutinized 475 graph account samples. They make up a corpus totalling 33,755 words and were written, without any previous rhetorical instruction, by my second-year students, whose ages range from 18 to 24 years and their English language proficiency from levels B1 to C1 in the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). They were asked to comment on five types of graphics: a pie chart, two line graphs, a tree diagram, one ring graph and one flow chart. Two of them were constructed and decontextualized (i.e. representing no authentic social context) and the rest, downloaded from the Internet or adapted from aviation manuals and aeronautics textbooks, introduced real topics, of interest to the writers or close to their everyday reality. The two decontextualized visuals were a line graph showing the ‘sales in millions’ of an unidentified company and a ring graph displaying three different populations (audiences) sorted by age, each in a ring, and four imaginary TV channels rendered in different colours. The contextualized graphs dealt with the average age of emancipation in Spain for males and females (a double time line), the three video consoles most sold in Spain during 2007 (a circle graph), the landing procedure for aeroplanes (a flow chart) and the classification of aircraft (a tree diagram). The tool used to spot and analyse the stance and engagement features in Hyland’s categorizations was the concordance freeware AntcConc.3.2.1w (Anthony, 2007), and a volunteer one-hour conferencing session with 86 participants was held after corpus analysis to back up my interpretation of the results.

# 4 Findings: low-stance and high-engagement data transfers

Thus far I have advanced that my students’ accounts are low-stance and high-engagement data transfers rather than commentaries, diglossic and often misaligned. Now I turn to why and how all these features come into being.

# 4.1 The whys: teachers’ and students’ expectations

My discourse-based survey brought to light the expectations of staff and students regarding the commentary of visuals. In all four departments, the teachers interviewed were contrary to graph account assignments as they unanimously thought that students were ‘poor verbalizers’. Add to this the fact that they believed marking too time-consuming, and we find a ‘vicious circle’: students are not given chances to practise because they lack the expertise and they can never acquire the knowledge without this experience. Exams and lectures continuously require them to exercise their receptive skills but productive tasks are limited to identification: to labelling graph points or drawing curves from numerical data, or to matching physical and chemical properties and behaviours with calculations and keywords.

As for students, the conferencing session disclosed that a vast majority (85 per cent) were aware of the register shift necessary to develop an academic style and acknowledged they had written their assignments in a way different from how they wrote to friends. The ‘differences’ they signalled involved impersonalization and lexical density through a highly nominal style (i.e. informativity through more abstract, cultivated words), and abundance of sentence connectors, all of which largely coincided with the features listed by AW manuals (e.g. Swales and Feak’s, 2004). Nearly 70 per cent of my informants stressed the need to use connectives to achieve explicitness more than in any other variety of prose, and these understandings corroborate Biber and Gray’s contention (2010) that elaboration in AW does not rely on syntactic intricacy but on compressed noun phrases, as well as its consequence that metadiscourse becomes indispensable to dissolve that heavily packed information.

Overall, these views of students on AW are consistent with their writing, as their nominalizations and prodigal use of metadiscourse in the present study and my earlier work (Sancho Guinda, 2011) have shown. In their accounts, learners are inclined to evaluate trend changes with premodified nouns not specific of trend description (e.g. ‘dramatic drop’, ‘very sudden climb’), well over their postmodified verb equivalents (e.g. ‘drops dramatically’, ‘climbs very suddenly’) and oneword verb versions (e.g. ‘slump’/‘collapse’, ‘boom’, ‘peak’, ‘trough’). Sounding ‘academically informative’ is my students’ main criterion of success in the task, which triggers a horror vacui urge to fill up the page and in doing so they mistake verbosity for informativity. This leads them to paraphrase visual data redundantly, import misplaced registers (e.g. conversational) or abuse metadiscourse, and distracts them from positioning themselves by appraising contents directly or by criticizing the validity of the graph. Lastly, around 20 per cent of conferencing participants admitted to having written in a colloquial tone ‘because it’s English’, something they would not do in engineering subjects.

# 4.2 The how: what electronic searches reveal

Through corpus analysis we might see stance and engagement strategies as subversive in the sense that they can change the rules of the written interaction. The interpersonal and stylistic assumptions underlying academic tasks may be challenged – intentionally or otherwise – by register shifts and excessive metadiscourse, to which I will be referring in brief.

# 4.2.1 Rhetorical and linguistic stance

Students’ stance-taking is predominantly covert. At a rhetorical level the two moves which are vehicles of direct stance, panoramic evaluations of a trend (e.g. ‘progressive/regressive’, ‘positive/negative’, ‘good/bad’, etc.) and data discussions, are not common (see Table 11.1). Viewpoint is largely transmitted through data treatment (sorting and highlighting) and through self-positioning towards the task (with insider or outsider framings), the text (with frequent metatextual references) and the interaction. A conversational tone (due to the ‘It’s English’ factor) echoes the colloquial mood of CLT discourse and tells how the writer approaches the graph account: less seriously than in technical subjects. This conversational style may result in a redefinition of the interaction in terms of field, tenor and mode. Field (i.e. content) is redefined by disclosing personal and tangential information, tenor (i.e. the relationship between participants) by turning teacher and student into conversation peers and subverting the roles of expert and apprentice, and mode (i.e. the channel) by misusing registers and importing orality into writing.

Conversational shifts may be caused by six agents likely to engender pragmatic deviance from AW: humour (Example 2), tropes (3) such as metaphors and similes (which synthesize stance markers and code glosses and so can be considered engagement devices), plotbuilding/storytelling (3–4) as a horror vacui discourse filler (mainly in decontextualized or extremely simple graphs), personal asides (5), personal disclosure (6) – unlike asides, with no parenthetical afterthought form, and dialogism, which in Example 7 rounded off a fairly skilled verbalization:

(7) Congratulations, you have landed an aircraft.

Closer attention to the moves in Table 11.1 reveals that while few students qualify the entire trend (e.g. as growing/declining, etc.) in a panoramic evaluation, many do frame the visual to avoid the abruptness of beginning straightaway with the data, and do it either from a repetitive external vantage point that restates the purpose of the graph (e.g. ‘This chart represents …’), already explicit in the title or the legend, or by imbuing the start with an air of in medias res or ‘account in progress’ that borders on engagement as a perception shared with the reader. Endophorics (i.e. metadiscursive items bringing the reader to concrete text portions, such as ‘as can be seen in the graph’), typically exert such effect. These two opening tactics can make writers appear more or less detached from the graphic and the task – as outsiders or insiders, but either choice provides them with ready-made language chunks to kick off and perhaps that is why they outnumber panoramic evaluations.

Sorting out and highlighting the data in a way that does not conform to the arrangement shown by the visual (i.e. that is alternative to it), entails a contrastive foregrounding with the application of some criteria – stance-taking. Each type of graphic has one or more inherent data progressions: for example, we decode time lines chronologically from the most to the least recent event or vice versa. We read ring graphs inwardly or outwardly, flow charts in a top-down or bottom-up fashion, and tree diagrams from left to right or its reverse. But we may comment on data focusing on the peaks and troughs of a trend or selectively covering certain time periods, bring forward a phase in a linear chain of steps, or single out subcategories within a classification out of impact, affinity or dissimilarity. Also, when the writer highlights the data by redistributing them differently, he/she is equally giving away his/her outlooks on how the trend should be tackled. He/she may fuse or split up percentages and categories and give or remove prominence from subjects and foci of action. For instance, in my flow chart samples on the aircraft landing procedure, the same step appears verbalized in several ways – personally or impersonally, in the active or in the passive voices, with or without anticipatory ‘IT-structures’, modalized or not, and more or less roundabout: ‘The pilot/You must extend the flaps to full’, ‘Flaps must be extended to full’, ‘The next step consists in extending the flaps to full’, ‘Then it is necessary to extend the flaps to full’, etc.

To conclude this overview of rhetorical stance, discussion – central to interpretation – may explain the data, incorporate them to broader contexts, make hypotheses and predictions and criticize representational veracity. In this study, curiously enough, no student heeded the contextual omission of the time lines on emancipation ages in Spain, which did not contemplate the possibility that females might leave the parental home at an early age due to marriage, not necessarily synonymous with emancipation. Moreover, only 18 accounts out of 184 (a single one female-authored) noticed the mismatch between a pie chart sector and the percentage printed on it, deliberately introduced to gauge critical reactions.

At a lexico-grammatical level, Table 11.2 shows that it is uncommon to reflect stance as explicit self-involvement by means of personal pronouns expressing opinion (e.g. ‘I think’, ‘in my view’), and that there is a moderate use of attitudinal adverbials (e.g. ‘unfortunately’, ‘surprisingly’) and boosters (e.g. ‘definitely’, ‘never’). Hedges are slightly more frequent, mainly functioning as vague quantifiers (e.g. ‘approximately’, ‘more or less’) to paraphrase and sort visual data.

# 4.2.2 Engagement strategies and their implications

Engagement features are three times greater than those of stance, as we may deduce by comparing the totals for stance and engagement at a linguistic level in Tables 11.2 and 11.3, but the motivation is not invariably reader-considerateness. We could say that engagement items may function as a horror vacui devices (i.e. as discourse fillers), since on average much reader guidance is superfluous and may contain up to six different types of phrasal and clausal redundancy. These types are at times concurrent, as the account in Example 8 illustrates. Pleonasmgoverned samples like this one seem to be simplicity-bound (the more obvious the graph, the less to say and the more discourse-filling devices needed) and far more abundant among female students (37 versus 9.4 per cent of male-authored texts out of 184 pie chart accounts).

[It’s a circle divided in [three circular]4 sectors]3 [which represent, depending on their size]5, [the amount of consoles sold in $\mathrm { S p a i n l } ^ { 2 + 6 }$ .

$3 =$ Transfer of obvious visual information   
$4 =$ Tautology (unnecessary qualification)   
$5 =$ Elementary graph traits/procedures   
$6 =$ Pleonasm (general verbosity)

Also in support of the statement that engagement may act as a horror vacui device, we should take into consideration that the Spanish culture, to which my students belong, is more reader- than writer- responsible (Connor, 1996: 53), and that they come to the task with deeply ingrained habits in the L1, no matter how much metadiscursive training they may have received from CLT and AW in English. All this points to a conscious ad hoc use of metadiscourse, prompted by their expectations about AW and CLT and the resulting urge to be informative and fluent. Interactive metadiscourse items, originally not included in Hyland’s (2005) engagement taxonomy but all the same a sign of concern for the reader, are over one and a half times more numerous than other engagement features of an interactional (i.e. interpersonal) kind.

In Table 11.3, the marginal recourse to rhetorical questions deserves some commentary. Questions occasionally appear among AW features in the inventories of EAP manuals (e.g. Hyland, 2006) and are also experienced as prompts and attention-getters before activities in CLT language methods. However, during conferencing the majority of students expressed their discomfort about posing them in academic assignments, afraid of usurping the teachers’ role by providing them with food for thought, something still ‘unnatural’ and ‘stylistically stilted’ in their current situation as learners. Such reluctance to displace discourses reinforces my initial assumption that students aim for alignment with instructors in academic tasks, and tells us that they are more sensitive to the disruptive effect of some features than to that of others. Their stance on rhetorical questions, by the way, could substantiate the ranking of these engagement devices among the potential causes of failed proximity.

Let us at this point zoom in on the massive difference between the uses of interactive metadiscourse and the rest of the engagement features (Table 11.4). It may strike us as odd that the AW and CLT pedagogical tone my students intend to mirror is not accomplished through code glosses; in other words, through clarification and explanation. Although surprising, this is a logical upshot of the low stance: there are very few ideas and opinions to make clear or illustrate because graphics are constantly paraphrased. The relatively high use of transition markers (i.e. inferential connectors such as ‘because’, ‘since’ or ‘therefore’) could refute this assertion, but their abuse and repeated misuse, addressed in short, confirm there is little genuine argumentation and expression of cause-and-effect relationships. Careful examination of their co-texts suggests that their frequencies are ‘swollen’, and to this I must add that in my corpus metadiscursive clutter (Crewe, 1990) altogether thwarts hypotaxis (i.e. clausal subordination), an indicator of stance as it signals a hierarchy of contents.

Table 11.3 Frequencies of engagement features   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Categories</td><td>Tokens</td><td>1000</td></tr><tr><td>Shared knowledge.</td><td>36</td><td>1.06</td></tr><tr><td>Reader pronouns</td><td>421</td><td>12.47</td></tr><tr><td>Questions</td><td>3</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td>Personal asides</td><td>10</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td>Directives</td><td>402</td><td>11.90</td></tr><tr><td>Interactive metadiscourse</td><td>1406</td><td>41.65</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2268</td><td>67.19</td></tr></table></body></html>

The two most frequent items in Table 11.4, endophorics and frame markers, occur in similar proportions. Frame markers (i.e. goal announcers such as ‘focus on’ or ‘the goal is’, sequencers like ‘in the first/last place’, stage-labellers of the type ‘in conclusion’ or ‘to summarize’ and topic shifters such as $^ { \prime } { \sf S O } ^ { \prime }$ or ‘back to’) are but one more manisfestation of my students’ intention of helping the reader process the verbalized information and fill up space. Endophorics, in comparison, are not solely resorted to as guides through the hypertext and discourse fillers, but owing to their multifunctionality: in effect, expressions like ‘as seen in the graph’ may additionally operate as face-saving hedges or disclaimers shielding stance and as text organizers (i.e. as prospective presentational structures and topic shifters).

We should note three singular facts intrinsic to graphic endophorics: (a) their boundary with some evidentials (e.g. ‘According to the graph’) and directives (e.g. ‘If you look at the graph’, ‘From the graph we can deduce …’) is fuzzy and accordingly I have regarded certain evidentials as endophorics, but not directives. These I have confined to verbs of perception and analysis following imperatives, impersonal IT- constructions with relevance markers, personal pronouns with modals, and exhortative conditionals (e.g. ‘Let’s look at …’, ‘It is important to note ...’, ‘We can focus on …’, ‘If you turn to …’); (b) the Spanish language has a tendency towards the solidarity construction WE $^ +$ VERB OF PERCEPTION (e.g. ‘As we can see …’) as presentational and topic shifter (Sancho Guinda, 2011), which may have influenced endophoric counts; (c) it appears that the directive force of endophorics increases in multimodal channels and with graphic complexity: in students’ words, we readers feel ‘more tempted’ to return to previous text fragments in multimodal environments than in exclusively verbal texts, and to check visuals when they are complicated.

I will close this section with an outstanding finding concerning metadiscourse that explains its high figures in Table 11.3 and those of the frame markers in Table 11.4, and with a recapitulation of my line of argument. Students’ overuse and/or misuse of connective items may bear unintended pragmatic repercussions or give-offs (Goffman, 1959) other than those of redundancy, over-explicitness and verbosity: it may provoke misalignment through a displacement of discourses (Scollon and Scollon, 2003). For example, when markers of relevance and inference are introduced as discourse fillers between two or more consecutive procedural steps in a flow chart, and those steps are unmarked as to importance, then the reader may get the impression that the need to carry out the actions in question stems from the writer’s appraisal, possible only thanks to his/her extensive expert knowledge (Examples 9 and 10, my italics). Below these lines are the steps exactly as in the flow chart that students had to describe:

(…)   
Keep speed steady so there is no runway overshooting $\blacktriangledown \cdot$   
Flare aircraft when crossing runway threshold   
Lower nose wheel and use reverse thrust at touchdown

The metadiscursive intrusions in Examples 9 and 10 do not alter the sequence of steps nor distort the process description semantically, but throw an accidental ‘mask’ onto the students’ discourse by momentarily inverting the roles of teacher and learner. They differ notably from the simple disguises of patent visual information as a deduction (Example 11, italics mine), where the inferential markers and redundant glossing used cannot convey online judgements based on specialist backgrounds:

(9) For landing it’s important that the pilot flares the aircraft when crossing the runway threshold.

(10) Next the aircraft keeps speed steady so there is no runway overshooting. Then the pilot rotates the nose of the aircraft because the process of landing must be at a low speed. (11) The best video-console in Spain is Wii because it has got the biggest sector (43 per cent), it means it is the best seller.

To summarize, my line of reasoning is as follows: students’ perception of the commentary task as an extremely asymmetric power relationship impels them to seek alignment and mimic features from the two registers they have been recurrently exposed to, AW and CLT. From the former they emulate its dense informativity. From the latter, its chatty tone favouring fluency over accuracy. From both, the profusion of metadiscursive items. They confuse informativity with verbosity and develop a horror vacui – a fear of the blank page for having ‘nothing to say’ – driving them to shift registers, become redundant and link propositions superficially with connectives to make up for the lack of overt stance-taking. Sometimes this metadiscursive clutter gives off involuntary nuances that superimpose a second ‘mask’ (a fake ‘connoisseur identity’) onto the blended one joining AW and CLT, with which students strive to negotiate their identities as knowledgeable individuals, most often unsuccessfully.

# 5 A final reflection

The collective diglossia exhibited by my students as proximity strategy certainly embraces stance options evaluating their audience by means of topic disclosure and reader-considerateness, and represents the synchronic voice of a community in the making. Yet proximal positioning should not make graph accounts inefficient or pragmatically deviant data transfers but enable learners to carve out an authentic academic voice. It is in our hands as researchers and instructors to help them see that in competent AW informative density and explicitness also pull in opposite directions, and that what makes their own writing unskilled or even transgressive is the sharp imbalance between those stance and engagement features in tension. To bridge that imbalance I advocate the synergy of two remedial actions: socioliteracy and the provision of stance paradigms as a corrective for redundancy, pragmatic deviance and metadiscoursal excesses, with the situational voices these may accidentally originate.

The socioliteracy dimension would help novice writers discern what communities they need to address and through what linguistic and rhetorical features. My informants, for example, would learn that they cannot ‘have it both ways’ and seek discursive alliance with the AW and CLT contingents simultaneously, although for them their respective informative density and anecdotal tones are compatible ingredients of a miscellaneous academic stamp they have fabricated during their schooling. They would finally grasp that these resources are poles in a continuum of options to be calibrated according to the purpose, situation, participants, matrix genre where the visuals are inserted, graph type, discipline and national culture – with its standards of reader tact and tolerance to digression. Teachers should also insist that the EAP and ESP subjects need not incur colloquialism and stylistic leniency to foster fluency.

My proposal for a stance paradigm offers covert and overt options. Covert stance would include the selection and layout of four basic rhetorical moves in graph commentaries (i.e. graph framing, data sorting, data highlighting and data evaluation/discussion) and techniques for their development (except for discussion, always overt). The implications of repetition, register shifts, metadiscursive guidance, (im)personalization, modalization/emphasis, lexical abstraction (specificity and vagueness), style focus (nominal or verbal) and tense and aspect choices should be thoroughly explained here. Overt stance would by contrast train learners in the use of the lexico-grammatical and rhetorical supplies to discuss data by evaluating the trend and flagging representational flaws. With this conjunction of socioliteracy and stance and engagement devices, in sum, students would gain a comprehensive picture of the resources at their disposal, and so make themselves understood by assembling an academic idiolect in consonance with the targeted community of practice.

# Part IV Variation of Stance and Voice in Academic Discourse

# 12 Stance and Voice in Academic Discourse across Channels

Ann Hewings Open University, UK

# Introduction: developing digital voices

Developments in technology are opening up new channels for written academic discourse, using electronic devices to supplement paper-based media. These interactive technologies become part of evolving academic literacy practices and affect both what writers and readers expect and is expected of them in high-stakes genres like essays and reports. The influence of electronic environments is reflected in overall generic structure, authorial voice and individual knowledge claims, as well as in how writers construct themselves and their arguments and create and disseminate their work (Lea and Jones, 2011).While traditionally crafted assignments – whether on paper or screen – are likely to maintain a strong status hierarchy between tutor (i.e. anyone with a teaching role) and student, interactive communication allows the flattening of such hierarchies through collaboration and the creation of different writer voices.

In this chapter I focus on channels using screen-based media that foster interactivity, communicating with readers who can write back and contribute to either the construction of a single text or to the thinking of one or more interactants. The ‘voices’ constructed in screen-based interactions are not necessarily similar to those usually valued in formally published or assessed genres, and only a limited number of studies examine how the two interact. I examine research studies into academic discourse in a variety of discussion forums, blogs and wikis, occasionally comparing them to more traditional writing. Much of the research cited is located within a social constructionist approach to learning which foregrounds the dialogic and emphasizes the use of language to understand and build knowledge. This results in consideration of the interaction as a window into the intellectual development of individuals as inscribed by their ‘voice’.

While there is much overlap in the use of the terms ‘stance’ and ‘voice’, for the purposes of this chapter I refer to research which both focuses on the textual characteristics of writing involved in persuasion, evaluation, and judgements, more often grouped under the heading of stance, and to voice, research which takes a wider perspective and in which the construction of writer identity is foregrounded.

In the context of academic writing ‘voice’ has had many different interpretations (Elbow, 2007; Sperling and Appleman, 2011). Some views define it as personal and expressive but do not reject the role of socially determined or constructed discourse norms: for example, according to Hirvela and Belcher (2001: 85) it helps to flesh out ‘the person behind the written word’, and for Ivanicˇ and Camps (2001) it provides a means for ‘self-representation’. Prior (2001) argues that both conceptions of voice are simultaneously possible, a view endorsed by Sperling and Appleman’s recent review of research. They locate voice within a Bakhtinian perspective in which it is imbued with social, cultural, historical and political significance and metaphorically encompasses identity or agency. Elbow (2007: 177) uses glosses such as ‘ethos, or implied author or persona’ and contrasts approaches to teaching and analysing writing which focus on voice (i.e. on identity or persona) with those centred on ‘text’ in Biber et al.’s (1999), Hunston and Thompson’s (2000) and even Hyland’s (2000) sense – that is, on the analysis of the grammar of style. Despite these difficulties, or possibly because of the all-embracingness of the term, voice is a concept that has maintained its popularity in descriptions of writing and its effect on the reader.

Through screen-based technologies, students are encouraged to interact not just with their tutor but also with peers, and sometimes with those outside academia through synchronous (real time) or asynchronous communication. They may draw on sources beyond the academic and their interactions may be traditional written text or multimodal. Whatever combination is selected, writers must consider their readership, advance knowledge claims, acknowledge those of others and use generic structures, all factors that are integral to successful academic communication and indicative of the understanding of knowledge construction and dissemination practices within a discipline. Advances in across-platform working on the Web have promoted social and collaborative forms of interaction such as the wiki, which can be a tool for drawing on the maximum number of people to help construct and disseminate knowledge such as in Wikipedia, or a more confined collaborative writing space where students craft a text and where their tutor can see and crucially assess the final product and the individual contributions. In these recent knowledge-making and displaying spaces academic discourse is evolving and voice is open to greater variation.

# Discussion forums and email

Discussion forums or e-conferences have been used in academic settings since the 1990s and much research took place at the beginning of this century into their pedagogic value. They have been used as a supplement to face-to-face discussions and in distance learning institutions where they may be the only context for student interaction. Discussion topics are usually initiated by tutors inviting students to explore issues in more depth or facilitating language practice for L2 learners.

Considerable research into this genre has focused on these three major strands: (a) the quantity and quality of student interaction, (b) the reactions generated by tutor strategies, and (c) the level and nature of interactivity through analyses of argumentation and authorial voice. All three contribute to our understanding of the expression of stance and voice in this type of electronic communication.

# (a) Studies on students’ interaction

Early studies on student interaction in forums counted the number of messages as an indication of their pedagogic usefulness and later started to investigate why some forums were more interactive than others (Tolmie and Boyle, 2000; Andriessen, 2006). While forums can allow greater reflection time than is available in face-to-face conversation, they can also be an interaction of the unwilling where real engagement with issues and other students is not clearly observable. In particular, students may be reluctant to participate, in the knowledge that their posts are relatively permanent and available for scrutiny, leading to anxiety over the message and the style (Hewings and Coffin, 2007). To counter student reserve, Hammond (2000: 259–60) advocates a ‘communicative approach’ to promote a more personal tone than that associated with more formal channels of academic discourse.

In contrast to findings on students’ unwillingness to participate, Warschaur (2002: 56) concluded that technology enabled some reluctant students to have a voice, to write about and discuss their own experiences and concerns and to take the time to reflect on those of others. In an ESL academic writing context, he found that forums were a ‘powerful tool for assisting students in invention and reinvention, discovery and exploration, reflection and negotiation – enhancing students’ opportunities to think critically about the academy and their role in it’.

Students’ willingness to interact may also depend on their familiarity with screen-based technologies. Today’s ‘digital natives’ (Prensky, 2001), the generation that has grown up with the internet, have had greater exposure than the students tracked by Warschaur or Hewings and Coffin. The students in Example 1 appear comfortable with screen technologies and exhibit sophisticated skills in handling forum interactions to maintain a constructive dialogue and in putting forward their views. However, they had to be encouraged to participate by making their contributions count towards assessment. The data come from a case study by Gills (2010: 28–9) not on voice or stance, but on the use of forums in teaching English literature to undergraduates in a UK university. The brief extracts below are from a series of posts in which students engaged in a critical dialogue on Postmortem, a crime novel by Patricia Cornwell.

# Example 1

Student A

Was anyone else disappointed with the end of Postmortem, or felt a little cheated by the fact that the killer turned out to be “just a pasty-faced boy with kinky dirty-blonde hair… $^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { ! \mathrm { ~ I ' m } }$ not sure why, but I was expecting something more, something better, something more interesting.

Knox’s rules tell us the criminal should be someone we’ve met early in the story, but whose thoughts we haven’t followed. S.S. Van Dine’s rules (quoted by Todorov) say the criminal should be a main character …

# Student B

Disappointing? Well I must say I wasn’t disappointed at all but I can see why one would be. The expectation with detective fiction is that the reader already knows the killer (a convention identified by the two gentlemen you quoted)…

If you apply ‘Post Mortem’ to the conventions of Golden Age detective fiction then it is undoubtedly disappointing (although potentially subversive as I intend to point out) but ‘Post Mortem’ fails to conform to genre conventions in a number of ways …

While Gill does not address the issue of stance or voice, analysis of the data demonstrates how students’ personal voice (I was expecting something more, something better, something more interesting) interweaves with elements of academic style (‘Post Mortem’ fails to conform to genre conventions in a number of ways … ): they address other students directly, use first person pronouns and colloquial expressions, and refer to their own emotions. Their particular stance on the novel is clearly expressed with attention to grammar, spelling and expression and supported by reference to the text and to the literature, but it is also rooted in their own personal response.

# (b) Reactions to tutors’ strategies

Warschaur’s (2002) study concentrated on the different strategies and theoretical orientations to learning that tutors brought to the use of screen technologies. Painter et al. (2003) also investigated tutor strategies, concluding that students benefited from a degree of modelling to enable them to take a role in the interaction, to find a voice. Groups in which the tutor questioned what students had said and thereby opened up spaces for responses and other probing questions had more student involvement than those where a tutor was only a welcoming presence promoting interpersonal engagement but leaving the discussion space to the students. This study suggested that asymmetrical power structures, where tutors show more control of the tasks and model the discourse are more academically successful in encouraging students to put forward viewpoints and take a stance.

Archer (2005: 80) used synchronous forums and email exchanges with a group of educationally disadvantaged students on an engineering foundation programme in South Africa. They were paired with experts with whom they discussed their work via email, while in class they interacted with other students online. The asymmetrical power relations between mentor and learner illustrate how students can construct new or different identities. Archer highlights two students with very different voices (Examples 2 and 3). The first, Tracy, takes ownership of her work through the pronoun $M \gamma$ but shows uncertainty and deference in her final question to her expert mentor. She does not craft her writing to the extent of correcting repeated words or putting in spaces after full stops, but does write in full sentences and use technical vocabulary:

# Example 2

• Tracy

My report also also proposes a better way of tele-communication, which is cost-effective and at the same time suitable for the village. The recommendation this time being solar-energy operating system for tele-communication. Does this strike you as realistic in the context of SArural development?

Her mentor questions her on the precise usage of some of these technical words such as ‘telecommunication’ and prompts her to be more precise. Archer argues that this gives her a chance to try out academic discourse and start to use grammatical constructions often associated with academic writing which influence the interpersonal tenor of the text by ‘creating authorial distance between the author and the subject matter’ (2005: 81). The extent to which Tracy is constructing a particular voice within academic discourse becomes apparent when compared with one of her peers, Catherine (Example 3):

# Example 3

Catherine

My report proposes the following: It proposes some way of improvement of housing situation in rural area. But from what I got from the Expert’s reply … I think I gonna just start my report all over AGAIN …. (and we got test this week,,, and tha next week,,, yeah we got tha whole time in the world, all right?)   
Anyway, I’ll go got some info. from what Tha X-pert suggested … Ciao

Archer claims that this type of hip-hop dialect is used by many of her students, but here Catherine is being deliberately subversive in both the form and the substance of what she says. This contrasts with her classroom behaviour, which is very shy and quiet. Archer suggests that the overall form of the text is influenced by conventions used within SMS text messaging, a writing technology characterized by spelling conventions that fuse historical and contemporary writing practices and the creativity typical of conversation (Tagg, 2011). In a later message, Catherine, while still using the same code, discloses feelings about the work she is doing, directly addresses her expert and uses her own name as opposed to a pseudonym used previously. A level of intimacy is thereby constructed within the discourse. It would appear that Catherine’s initial subversive voice, while seemingly creating a barrier to interaction, mellows as a degree of trust is built up across the course of the exchanges.

# (c) Interactivity in terms of argumentation and authorial voice

Analysis of argumentation and authorial voice in forums has been undertaken by Coffin, Hewings and associates (e.g. Coffin and Hewings, 2005; Coffin et al., 2005; Hewings et al., 2006). Argumentation requires taking a stance, the putting forward of views together with supporting evidence and being prepared to interact with others to defend them. However, for asynchronous discussion forums to be successful, interpersonal aspects of the interaction cannot be neglected. Forum interactions enable students to rehearse and co-construct academic arguments and to construct themselves within a limited academic community of peers. Hewings and Coffin (2007) analysed three forums used by different student groups and their tutors on a distance programme leading to a Master’s in applied linguistics and observed a threefold voice strategy: the adoption by students of a hedging $^ { \prime } I$ as thinker’ identity; that of $w e +$ ‘teachers/educators’, which marks a more authoritative role and establishes a shared identity validating anecdotal experience; and an assertive fusion of the personal $I$ pronoun) with impersonality (it-clauses).

The $^ { \prime } I$ as thinker’ voice (e.g. Aptitude is, I believe, a factor to be considered …) was less face-threatening to peers as it acknowledged the personal nature of an opinion and therefore left it open to dispute, and also served, in academic discourse terms, to hedge a proposition, acknowledging the student as a novice, a non-expert, in the discipline. Simultaneously, this strategy also helped to maintain a constructive, non-adversarial tenor. The $^ \prime w e ^ { \prime } +$ ‘teachers/educators’ voice served to either co-opt the reader into the unfolding argument or to strengthen a claim by linking it to a wider group such as teachers, thus giving greater authority to anecdotal evidence. The use of anecdotes indicated the personal and professional teacher voice that students were bringing into the discussions – building a shared identity which was used to validate experience as support for arguments. This was transferred to their single-authored assignments where the ‘we as teachers’ voice was used to make stronger assertions and $^ { \prime } I$ as thinker’ was used where greater circumspection was needed. The combination of impersonal it-clauses with the personal pronoun $I$ (e.g. $I$ feel that it is not really academically sound to …) conveyed a strong authorial voice through assertion in the impersonal clauses, while the use of ${ } ^ { \prime } { I } ^ { \prime }$ acknowledged the personal in relation to the jointly constructed forum texts. This construction may also indicate a reluctance to take on the purely impersonal voice associated with academic texts. Interviews with students (Example 4, from Coffin et al. 2005: 477) indicated a range of views on the use of forums:

# Example 4

Student A: … I feel it helped me reflect more and think about ideas more deeply and consider other people’s opinions in relation to my own … it also helps to see your ideas and thoughts in writing sometimes, and to have other people’s ideas there to refer to later.

• Student B: Talking is more spontaneous, I can use my arms and hands to talk, I can see if the others follow me, I can rephrase, and change my form of expression, as I am talking, and clarify more. It’s a different genre. For me, the Internet was always only for informal emails, and writing academically was a very different style; these conferences are somewhere in between, and I still haven’t ‘found myself’ in that style.

Student A clearly felt positively about the experience and the opportunities the forums gave for reflection but student B was uncomfortable in the in-between styles common in forum discussions. Such examples are a useful reminder that it is the individual’s response to the technology that is central and generalizations about pedagogic value are contingent on a variety of factors. Joiner and Jones (2003) concluded that the quality of argument in face-to-face discussions was higher than that in forum discussions, possibly because at the time of their research, students and tutors needed more practice in using online forums.

More recently, Chandrasegaren (2008) looked at high school students who could be considered ‘digital natives’ but who were novices in academic writing. She compared stance-taking and supporting moves in unassessed forum interactions and in assessed academic essays. In partial contrast to Joiner and Jones, her students showed competence in argumentation strategies in informal forum contexts, but did not apply that within traditional academic discourse. Monitoring forum discussions allowed Chandrasegaren (2008: 251) to gauge her students’ overall argumentation skills and to realize that it was adopting ‘the attitudinal posturing of “arguer”’ in academic discourse where difficulties were arising. The use of the word ‘posturing’ implies adopting an identity which is not the student’s own in order to argue effectively in an academic setting. Although she does not use the word ‘voice’, I would argue that Chandrasegaren is helping her students to find a new voice for academic argumentation, one that perhaps needs to blend institutional expectations of taking a stance on issues with the identity of the novice just moving into higher academic discourses.

In a very different context, a paper by Cheng-Wen and Archer (2008) illustrates the use of forums in South African medical education. Drawing on academic literacy approaches to student identities, the authors investigated the interaction between medical students in an unassessed course-based forum. Using Clark and Ivanicˇ’s (1997) conception of the construction of identity or the self in discourse, they discussed the ‘discoursal self’ constructed through discourse; the ‘autobiographical self’ which draws on people’s personal histories and affiliations; and the ‘self as author’ or the ‘authorial voice’ which portrays the degree of authority and personal presence an author invests in a text. With respect to self-as-author they note the use of personal pronouns, particularly $I$ and we, and coincide with Hewings and Coffin (2007) in their perception of a student using we and rhetorical questions as expressing more authority, since she draws her readers into the assertions she is making and presents generalized facts. In contrast, a fellow student who uses strong modality to assert his beliefs uses $I ,$ which acknowledges that the opinions put forward are his own and may not be shared. Cheng-Wen and Archer note that the selves constructed are not stable, often changing within postings, and that the forum acts as a site to make meanings through social interaction and construction. The forums brought together medical students, who in the context of South Africa were likely to have very different social and cultural backgrounds, and enabled them to interact and together build their identities and knowledge as future doctors. By providing a lively space for interaction, student medics could express a stance on particular topics without academic consequences, thereby enabling interaction which had the potential to transform and deepen understandings.

The studies discussed in this section indicate that a variety of activities are being carried out on forums with aims from supporting the learning of argumentation skills relevant to academic discourse, to helping students take on the voice and persona of their chosen disciplines or careers. The textual nature of the interaction may aid reflection on ideas and scaffold students’ critical thinking as well as provide a space for the exploration and validation of thoughts and experience from beyond academia.

# Blogs, wikis and m-learning

In many societies the generations growing up in the 1990s and beyond have become accustomed to using the affordances of what O’Reilly (2005) called Web 2.0. These include use of sites where content creation, sharing and interaction are facilitated. Despite the potential of wikis and blogs where collaborative creation of content and discussion of ideas for your own and others’ use is a key feature, there has been little direct research on voice. Blogs are used as spaces to give opinions and make links to other content, as a channel for personal expression, and by academics as a means of disseminating ideas and engaging in interaction. Blogs of the personal expression type are also sometimes called e-journals and it is these that are emerging more specifically as a pedagogic genre. Studies focus on their use as both a personal space for exploring ideas and as a public space where these thoughts are open to scrutiny. Both these aspects have been significant in the use of blogs by English as an additional language (EAL) students (Bloch, 2007; Gebhard et al., 2011; Yang, 2011).

In a study in the US, Bloch (2007) had learners use a blog to present a more personal image of themselves to their fellow students and discuss the problems of plagiarism. A number of the students had come from war zones where their education had been disrupted, and as a result there was distance between them and their classmates. The blog writing did not require an initial focus on grammatical form so they were able to draw on their own vernacular literacy, that is, they did not need to conform to standard academic discourse norms. Bloch suggests that this ‘can give a writer a sense of authority and authorship’ (2007: 132) which traditional academic writing does not. The blogs meshed vernacular literacy practices with learning to take a stance on issues in ways expected of university students. Students were subsequently expected to incorporate ideas from their blog interactions into traditional academic assignments. They were constructing and refining their voices within the new context of a blog and rehearsing their ideas for assessed work (cf. Hewings and Coffin, 2007).

A further Web 2.0 space for academic writing is the wiki, which promotes collaborative construction of a text and provides an additional space for comment or feedback. Diverging views have been expressed about the type of writing and the voice of the writers in wikis. Myers (2010) views wikis as the opposite of blogs, in that they are impersonal and focused on consensus while blogs are personal in style and viewpoint. Some support for this view comes from Hemmi et al.’s (2009) study of Master’s students who reported wikis to be an environment characterized by formality and discipline which some found lonely and isolating. There were also concerns about interpersonal aspects relating to peer-editing.

Research by Kuteeva (2010: 3), on the other hand, emphasizes the constructive potential of wikis in knowledge building to help students integrate into a community as learners of English. In an examination of the role of the wiki in changing reader–writer relationships, she characterizes writing as both an interaction and a construction in which ‘writers simultaneously shape their discourse to involve the reader and are influenced by the readers’ expectations’. Drawing on Hyland’s study of metadiscourse as a way of describing how writers engage with readers and express a position vis-à-vis the content, she distinguishes interactional versus interactive resources. Using this framework she analysed two student wiki-based tasks – a collaborative writing task by one group for another, and the writing of individual argumentative texts which were available for peer comment via a wiki. Students reported that posting their work publicly made them pay particular attention to formal features such as grammar and spelling.

Analysis of the history of the wiki’s construction also demonstrated this concern, so unlike some of the previous studies examined, these students did not see an electronically mediated space as less formal in terms of these aspects of text production. However, taking the reader into account in the writing process, a feature associated with many analyses of stance, was a feature of both the collaborative texts and the argumentative writing subject to peer review. The argumentative texts specifically showed a high use of engagement markers (personal pronouns, questions and commands), implying a greater awareness of audience in ways reminiscent of those found by Hewings and Coffin, and Huang and Archer in their analyses of forums. This suggests that wikis are not just impersonal spaces; their use may contribute not only to collaborative text production, but also to an awareness of the need to take the reader and the co-writer into account. What is not yet clear is whether the voice created within the wiki is a collaborative composite construction or a mix of voices.

The final aspect of screen-based technologies and academic discourse that I want to touch on is that related to mobile learning (mlearning). By this I mean screen-based technologies that students can use in geographically non-traditional learning contexts and within which they can create new learning environments. The most obvious medium is the mobile phone, which is becoming a common learning device. Claims for m-learning are that it is more spontaneous, encourages independence and collaboration, removes some of the formality from the learning experience, and helps in raising self-confidence and self-esteem. ‘A mobile learning experience is an occasion to capture a moment of interest, for example through the action of annotation, with the goal of continuing to build on that interest in another place, at a later date’ (Kukulska-Hulme, 2009: 162).

At present, the literature relating to m-learning has not focused on the texts created and the voices constructed by students. However, if the affordances outlined above are borne out, then they would be apparent in the voice constructed by students. Comas-Quinn et al. (2009) used what they refer to as ‘mobile blogs’ to facilitate active participation by university students learning Spanish. On a visit to Spain, students were set the task of taking photographs and uploading them to a map where they could then annotate them with audio or text. Other students were then encouraged to comment on the photographs or annotations. The site with the map, photos and annotations continued to be available following the visit to Spain and Comas-Quinn et al. noted that the type of posting changed. During the visit students were concerned about their interactions with the culture, but after the visit students’ postings related more to the social aspects of the trip and the construction of knowledge and memories relating to the group experience. These mobile blog postings represent multimodal academic discourse of yet another type. Students did not focus particularly on form, they were more attentive to participating in the activity, capturing the moment and sharing it (Comas-Quinn, personal communication). From the description outlined it is clear that such a multimodal site for academic discourse creates opportunities for the construction of very different identities and voices. Students are the creators and deliverers of content for their peers. They are using a technology, usually the mobile phone camera, which is associated with informal settings. Their voice is likely to be affective, reflecting on the photograph or the experience and prioritizing the interpersonal. Analysis of voice in such contexts would require the bringing together of analytical techniques that focused on text and image and sound.

# Conclusion

As newer channels of communication, screen-based technologies enable and promote different forms of interaction and genres of discourse. Research into the texts constructed suggests that they provide sites where students can experiment with their voices and rehearse arguments with peers. Some treat these sites as just a different form of academic writing, maintaining formality and status hierarchies, while others use them as more creative spaces where they can construct and try out identities (e.g. through hip-hop dialects and other ‘subversive’ discourses) which differ from those employed in conventional learning situations.

The aspect of constructive argumentation within (asynchronous) forums draws on the notion that enabling reflection on the views of others can lead to a deeper engagement with concepts and points of view – expressed through the stance taken towards and within the forum discussion postings. Studies suggest that deeper engagement and argumentation do not automatically come about as a result of the change of channel. Rather, the careful structuring of tasks, the possible modelling of interaction, and often an element of assessment are conducive to productive forum engagement.

Extrapolating from the information available and the affordances of the technology, it seems that blogs and m-learning are likely to offer more informal writing spaces in which students are not so constrained by traditional genre practices. In forums and emails, however, the type of discourse produced is variable, neither carefully crafted academic prose nor purely personal anecdote, and sometimes even subversive. As a halfway house it may allow students to begin to formulate ideas and responses to the ideas they are encountering in a context which is relatively free and unjudgemental. Tutors can help to construct learning activities using channels which draw on Web 2.0 technologies and multimodal affordances that enable learners to share experiences. Students are then at greater liberty to choose how they represent themselves and their positions. They may feel more comfortable maintaining the type of academic persona that is inculcated through traditional academic writing practices or they may use the space to construct themselves anew with multiple different voices. They can try out different positions in an argument from those they eventually choose to submit in a traditional assignment; they can assume the voice of a teacher in commenting on another’s work, or of a manager in co-constructing a text on a wiki.

How students take up these possibilities and whether or not such use of a variety of channels becomes common in academic discourse among learners partly depends on whether the potentially creative and subversive voices of students are perceived as worth nurturing in the growing number of contexts in which learning takes place. Tutors need to understand and use the technology at least as well as their students, and to help them realize the potential for varying their articulation of voice and stance.

# 13 Voice and Stance across Disciplines in Academic Discourse

Marc Silver University of Modena and Reggio Emilia

# 1 Introduction: voice in academic discourse

For decades the study of voice has been the privileged domain of literary criticism. The question of understanding ‘who speaks’ (Genette, 1980) in the complex workings of narrative fiction, amidst myriads of characters, narrators, implied authors, etc., undoubtedly poses serious problems for the reader. It may, for this reason, seem paradoxical that such a concern should be central to academic writing, which distinguishes itself epistemologically from narrative fiction precisely for its need to present new knowledge as credible or true. But taken in another sense, I would affirm that the rhetoric of downplaying the interpersonal while foregrounding complex contents, characteristic of academic discourse, makes the need to interrogate voice all the more pressing in written academic texts.

Whether it be narrative fiction or the research article, one intriguing aspect of any analysis of voice in written discourse is its essential metaphoricity. We as readers identify or ‘hear’ voice regardless of or even on account of the silence of the written text, and while this in no way means voice can be treated as an optional extra (Ivanicˇ and Camps, 2001), it does seem to imply that its effects cannot simply be defined as the author ‘speaking’ through the text. If, as Matsuda and Tardy affirm (2007: 235), voice is ‘the construction of an author’s discursive identity’, such identity depends upon its (re)construction into ‘a composite subjective entity, or voice, by the reader’ (Aczel, 1998: 467; Matsuda and Tardy, 2007: 237). This is not to say that writers do not express a point of view or lead readers to embrace this view. On the contrary, they always encode their point of view in what is written (Stubbs, 1996: 197). It does, however, mean that voice is ultimately ascertained by the reader when attempting to make sense of the text, which depends in turn on the extent to which the writer is able to put her/himself in the minds of her/his readership. Writers construct texts by anticipating readers’ real and imagined views, their expectations and responses. This invisible interlacing or embedding of projected reader positions within the text, establishes ‘a virtual dialogue’ (Hyland, 2009: 111), and is one of the reasons why identity in discourse has to be taken as a social act, as the expression of social relations (Bakhtin, 1981). This socially inscribed dimension of voice is crucial in academic discourse, where the written text as shared practice moves careers and sanctions what knowledge will be legitimated.

This chapter addresses the question of disciplinary variation by focusing on a few of the ways voice operates in academic discourse. In it I take the position that while all academic discourse actively endeavors to convey knowledge persuasively, such conveyance often differs considerably across disciplines. Attempting to ascertain what these differences may be and how they work to create what disciplinary communities ‘know’ is anything but a merely formal question of stylistics. It tells us something about how knowledge is created and disseminated in and around academia and how beliefs are justified within these socially and culturally defined contexts.

My aim here is to interpolate voice on two interconnected but distinct planes: collective and individual. The first investigates voice as the effect of communal discourse modes or strategies. I analyze a few features of what I shall call paradigmatic as opposed to narrative voice, adopting a broad-based distinction from cognitive linguistics between paradigmatic and narrative modes of discourse. According to Bruner (1986: 12–13), the paradigmatic mode deals with general causes, provides verifiable references and tests empirical truths to fulfill the ideal of a mathematical system of explanation. With that purpose it employs categorization and conceptualization and relies formally on conjunction and disjunction, hyperonymy and hyponymy, implication, and any device by which general propositions are extracted from statements in their particular contexts. The narrative mode, by contrast, ‘strives to put its timeless miracles into the particulars of experience, and to locate the experience in time and place’ (Bruner, 1986: 13). It produces ‘a series of anecdotal descriptions of particular incidents. Narrative reasoning does not reduce itself to rules and generalities across stories but maintains itself at the level of the specific episode. Nor does it translate its emplotted story into a set of propositions whereby its dramatic and integrative features are forfeited’ (McGuire, 1990 in Polkinghorne, 1995: 11).

The second plane constructs authorial position and investigates voice as a set of effects emanating from mechanisms of stance and engagement to create a dominant but credible voice in the text. Interestingly, one of the key ways this is done is through the marked deployment of voices other than the writer’s own. These voices may be given emphasis or largely concealed, and can appear as indented citations before the text, as indirect or direct voices within it, or as footnotes and endnotes on its margins. They may be voices coming from other members of the disciplinary or academic community, historical or contemporary actors and experts or even aggregate voices expressing ideas circulating in and around communities. Preliminary to an understanding of how these voices may be used, a basic distinction has to be made between what Sinclair (1988) termed ‘averral’, the unmarked or default condition of written texts, where the reader is led to assume that the voice making affirmations is the writer’s own, and ‘attribution’, where a proposition is explicitly indicated as deriving from a source. Although these two conditions are in a certain sense oppositional, evaluation may be expressed just as much through attribution as through averral (Hunston, 2000), and it is often the interplay or weaving of the two which allows the writer to gain position while ‘controlling the level of personality in the text’ (Hyland in Fløttum, 2007: 89). I also explore some relevant ways through which reader participation is invoked to elicit support for the writer’s knowledge claims (devices signalling reader engagement have been proposed in the literature, e.g. Biber, 2006; Bondi, 1999; Hyland, 2004, 2005) as these mechanisms, along with those of stance/position, seem to offer a particularly interesting vantage point for understanding how voice comes to life through reader interpretation and identification.

Investigating language variation across disciplines has recently been accredited considerable importance (e.g. Becher, 1989; Biber, 2006; Charles, 2003; Conrad, 2001; Fløttum et al., 2006; Fløttum, 2007; Hyland, 2000; Hyland and Bondi, 2006; Silver, 2003, 2006). Sparked by genre theory, which acted as a catalyst for interest in variation within academic contexts, comparative disciplinary studies have to be seen as a critical response to a long-standing tradition that considered academic discourse as essentially referential, concerned primarily with communicating complex information and only marginally with how writers express such information or how readers are persuaded by such expression. Although genre studies initially categorized the similarities among text types in ‘moves’, ‘steps’ and acts’ as conventionalized patterns in conformity with shared communicative purposes (Swales, 2004; Bhatia, 2004), they also provided an organizational structure to analyze discourse, assembling rhetorical, argumentative and interactional aspects of a sociocultural and political nature. Further research into group practices began to privilege a more contrastive approach that pays attention to textual and contextual differences across disciplinary communities. In line with this approach, I will now describe the selection and treatment of the disciplinary samples object of my study.

# 2 The study: materials and methods

I concentrated my analysis on research article introductions from three disciplines: microbiology (MB), history of science (HS) and art history (AH). My decision to focus on this genre and section derives from the fact that for most disciplines the research article is considered the principal transmitter of disciplinary knowledge at the expert level, and within it the introduction is the privileged site for the construction of the writer’s persona by imposing a certain argumentative framework on the reader.

My choice of these three specific disciplines was somewhat less motivated. Since my interest was to examine voice features and effects, I thought it would be fruitful to juxtapose one field from the ‘hard’ sciences with one from the humanities and one ‘in between’, that is, a discipline which maintains science as its object of analysis but which dialogues with the humanities. For each of the three fields I have chosen what experts consider to be two of the most representative journals (Molecular Microbiology, Current Microbiology, History of Science, British Journal for the History of Science, History of Art and Art Journal), and have put together a corpus of 30 article introductions from each, all dating from 2009.

Analytically, my method consisted in a comprehensive reading of all 90 research articles to identify the introductions before classifying them according to their move and step development. Each was then catalogued in terms of the voice form(s) employed, using Bruner’s general classifications. I then proceeded to reread the samples in search of markers which would identify voice effects.

Some procedural observations must be noted: (1) only MB journals contain well-delineated introductions, (2) HS and AH often have section divisions but the opening one is not necessarily called ‘introduction’, (3) I have disregarded length difference as a variable, and (4) when no introduction was spotted, I abandoned my search after the halfway point of the article. Given the wide range of features in which I identify voice, my remaining analytical work was exclusively qualitative, and what I am able to illustrate next are examples of some of the language devices found.

# 3 Findings

# 3.1 Voice mode: the case of microbiology

From a functional standpoint, my microbiology introductions show an extremely high degree of standardization, which differs only slightly from journal to journal. Applying Swales revised CARS model (2004), their move and step development (see Table 13.1) seems to evidence limited variation, almost all of which is accounted for in the model. This not only corroborates the descriptive importance of the CARS model but points to how it has predictive value for article construction within the discipline.

If I now factor in voice type, MB writers always open their articles in the paradigmatic voice, which means they proceed by isolating, classifying and describing a particular operation, object, problem, procedure or instance from a general condition, category or concept. The movement is therefore normally one of subordination from a generalized or abstracted concept to the elements or attributes comprising it or necessary for it. The writers’ claims revolve around how these elements or attributes are to be defined and experimented, which establishes and occupies the research niche by assuring ‘verifiable reference’ (Bruner, 1986: 13).

In correlating these first indications of voice with the CARS model, it is significant that in 50 percent of the introduction openings – where the writers are first establishing their territory (M1) – argumentation begins with a centrality claim for the research linking its importance and usefulness to some real-world problem or phenomenon. (See Example 1.) No such cases were found outside M1.

# Example 1

‘Viremia and the Magnitude of the Immune Response upon Infection of Green Monkeys with Dengue Virus Type 2 Are Strain-Dependent.’

Dengue virus is the most important human arboviral disease. At present, an estimated 50–100 million people are infected each year in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, with 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), the more severe form of the disease. […] (Current Microbiology (2009) 59 (6): 579)

The reader is informed of the gravity of the dengue virus and how it is transmitted. This is particularly interesting because the writers seem to be speaking beyond the confines of the disciplinary community addressed by the rest of the article. In almost all the cases analyzed, little recourse is made to highly specialized terminology, and it can be assumed that experts from the field are already familiar with general data of this sort. This was confirmed by interviews with field experts, one of whom pointed to the promotional function of highlighting the importance of the research for external grants and project funding. I would hypothesize that this type of relevance focus makes use of the objectivist, empirical ‘reminders’ to equate the gravity of the problem at hand to the importance of the stakes of the research, and therefore to the findings to be revealed. The fact that there were 10 occurrences in Current Microbiology and 5 in Molecular Microbiology might also suggest that in at least the former this opening is encouraged by the editors or has been consolidated over time.

# 3.2 Voice position: the case of history of science

In HS voice form and effects change radically: the universal use of the paradigmatic mode characterizing the MB introductions cedes to a far more diversified use.

As can be seen in Table 13.2, less than half of the samples maintained their paradigmatic voice throughout, and there were a significant number of cases where the narrative voice was dominant (see examples below). Extremely surprising were the two cases where the narrative voice was active to the (near) exclusion of the paradigmatic, because such a discourse mode all but precludes functional moves such as the establishing or occupying of one’s niche, essential in the CARS model.

Table 13.2 Voice in history of science

In effect, if we attempt to apply Swales’ model to our HS corpus, difficulties immediately present themselves. For one, in a number of cases the writers either shift abruptly from M1 to M3 or seem to fuse M2 and M3 together. Often, the functional development of HS introductions is nonlinear due to shifts from the narrative to the paradigmatic voice or vice versa. This translates into move shifts that may effectively occupy part of the research niche or territory even though these have not yet been completely defined, or acknowledged as such. The writer then returns to complete the niche at a later moment. In part, this may be explained by the fact that they do not immediately announce and justify their research, as opposed to MB authors. In general, little is said to describe its importance and it is not uncommon for the real object of interest to be made known only later. At this point (M3), the reader-interpreter is authorized to project her/his gaze backwards and come to see that the writer has effectively already established her/his niche (M2).

Another characteristic feature of HS introductions, in common with other forms of history, is the use of other voices in the text. In particular it is their commingling or ‘weaving’ (Silver and Bondi, 2004; Bondi and Silver, 2004; Bondi, 2007) that forms an essential part of the writer’s epistemological approach and stance. In Example 2, I briefly plot a few of the effects of these ‘other voices’.

# Example 2

‘NEWTON ON THE BEACH: THE INFORMATION ORDER OF   
PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA’   
Simon Schaffer (Hist. Sci., xlvii: 2009)   
WHAT I MAY SEEM TO THE WORLD

I know not what I may seem to the world, but as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

It is one of the most celebrated of Isaac Newton’s obiter dicta. Like many such, its provenance is hazy. The literary reference may well be to a passage from John Milton’s great redemptive poem Paradise regained (1671) where, in dialogue with Satan, Christ praises divine illumination above pagan learning: ‘who reads / Incessantly, and to his reading brings not $/ \left[ . . . \right] / $ As children gath’ring pebbles on the shore’. But the remark’s immediate relation with Newton is more ambiguous. The earliest version is found in a conversation of April 1730, three years after Newton’s death, between the gossipy man of letters Joseph Spence and the Jacobite, freemason and court tutor Andrew Ramsay. While chatting about Newton’s debt to ancient theology and his strange attitudes towards the doctrine of the Trinity, Ramsay quoted Newton’s phrase, adding it was ‘as great as all’ of Principia mathematica. Never one to let a nice epigram slip, Ramsay then incorporated the expression in his 1732 Plan of education for a young prince, composed to help tutor the heirs of a noble French clan. But in commending his own version of Newtonian philosophy Ramsay modified the sense: ‘as Sir Isaac Newton said, […] a boundless ocean of which he has no idea.’ The reference was to Pauline doctrine in 1 Corinthians 13: ‘now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face.’ Newton’s loyal nephew John Conduitt, concerned with materials for the great man’s biography, dutifully pasted into his own scrapbook a cutting from a Jacobite newspaper that carried this extract from Ramsay’s Plan.

The article in question opens with an integral autobiographical citation written by the historical actor and research object, Isaac Newton. The voice which comments it is paradigmatic – it positions the letter within a larger set (‘Newton’s obiter dicta’) and frames it vis-à-vis the discipline (‘one of the most celebrated’, ‘its provenance is hazy’). The voice is authoritative since the position it offers is categorically affirmed without external sources being mentioned. With the third sentence the voice shifts. The writer offers a hypothesis as to where the inspiration for Newton’s initial citation may have come from. He now cites what may be the relevant passage from Paradise Regained but rather than resolving the question, the citation from Milton is said to open up a new ambiguity, which engenders the extensive use of the narrative voice (from ‘While chatting’ to ‘Ramsay’s Plan’). As is customary in historical accounts, the recourse to narrative is offered through the direct and indirect reporting of historical actors. It is now Andrew Ramsay who is conjecturing about Newton on this question and to do so he too uses a citation, which the writer invokes as ‘Pauline doctrine in 1 Corinthians $1 3 ^ { \prime }$ , quoting the full passage for us.

This constant movement between paradigmatic and narrative voice along with the weaving and embedding of other voices covers the first pages of the article and only gives way somewhat when the writer explicitly occupies his niche (‘The aim here is to use the figure of Newtonian solitude to examine the emergence $\cdots ^ { \prime } H S ,$ xlvii: 245). Although few of the openings were as protracted as the present example, the back and forth movement between the paradigmatic and the narrative accounted for 12 out of 30 or 40 percent of the HS introductions, and the weaving of actor and expert voices along with the writer’s averred voice was a characteristic trait of most. Epistemologically, articles of this sort, which emphasize the complex narrative cloth of history, also highlight the fuzziness of territorial borders as they critically toy with what other historians see as the self-evidence of the historical fact.

Example 3 illustrates another important aspect of voice in constructing writer identity (found in 5 of the 30 articles): the strategic use in the text of interactional features such as rhetorical questions.

# Example 3

‘Science on Stage: Amusing Physics and Scientific Wonder at the Nineteenth-Century French Theatre’ – Sofie Lachapelle (Hist. Sci., xlvii: 2009) Ambiguous boundaries between science and magic were not a novelty of the nineteenth-century magic shows. In his work on Parisian fairs a century earlier, the historian Robert Isherwood has argued that there was no clear distinction between science and magic in the popular mentality of the eighteenth century; […]. Isherwood has successfully depicted the world of the eighteenthcentury fairs and popular entertainment in all that it held of the mysterious and the marvellous for the public. Here, I suggest that this sense of wonder did not disappear in the following decades; that, on the contrary, the concepts of magic and science remained fluid for most Parisians throughout the nineteenth century; and that, at least as far as the marvellous is concerned, the nineteenth century had much more in common with the eighteenth century than is usually assumed by historians. After all, the latest inventions could easily be understood as moving science closer to the realm of the perceived magical and occult. Ballooning, telegraphy, and photography, for example, brought about improvements that would have appeared impossible to previous generations. If it was now accepted that one could travel the air, why not travel to the moon or to Mars? If it had become possible to communicate over long distances, why not consider the possibility of contact across time, or death even? If one could capture the exact image of a living being on a photographic plate, why not that of a spirit? In a world in which news of technological development and scientific discoveries were as eagerly welcomed by the reading public as discussions of séances and haunted houses, the categories of science, magic and the occult remained tangled together, permeable and changing.

In the passage above, the writer constructs her own position around her indirect reporting of historian Robert Isherwood’s, which asserts the ambiguous distinction between science and magic in the popular mind of the eighteenth century. Her recourse to this expert voice strategically allows her to introduce her own thesis, which is based on the temporal extension of just such an ambiguity through the nineteenth century. Strikingly, although the expert voice the writer foregrounds espouses a position which is perfectly in line with her own, she nonetheless announces her thesis (occupies her niche) through a counter-claim (‘I suggest that this sense of wonder did not disappear […]; […] on the contrary […]’). Much later on in the sentence she will add ‘[…] than is usually assumed by historians’, but she does this without offering specification or formal reference of any kind. Negation and a contrast marker (combined with later, generic attribution to ‘historians’) is employed here to bolster the legitimacy and the importance of the writer’s claim and may be an indication that this is a habitual argumentative posture of the discipline.

The sentences which follow (from ‘After all’ through to the end of the three conditional questions) constitute a radical shift in voice perspective as they appeal directly to the reader. In general, these engagement strategies fulfill two essential goals. They invite readers to participate in the discussion, making them feel part of the debate and the disciplinary community, and they anticipate possible objections to the writer’s position by guiding the readers towards favorable interpretations. Here, ‘After all’, a particularizing focus marker which reinforces the logical consequentiality of the ‘I suggest’ where the writer introduces her thesis, assumes an important interactional role. It determines a shift in register – from formal to colloquial – and solicits the readers’ direct involvement in the text. It is rhetorically positioned to oscillate between a purely logical appeal for readers to ‘judge for yourselves’ and an evaluational appeal for the readers to accept what the writer infers: that the thesis she is hypothesizing is ‘eminently reasonable’. As we shall see shortly, I think it is fair to say that the syntactic repetition of the conditionals supported by the initial engagement marker ‘After all’ guides the reader to the desired interpretation while at the same time bolstering her/his participation in the text.

In the three conditional questions which follow there are two particularly salient aspects which have a direct bearing on the use of voice: the type of conditional questions being presented and the time settings of the writer-narrator in them. The three conditionals all possess the same structure: If P, why not Q. According to Declerck and Reed, conditionals of this sort with both assertive and assertoric Q-clauses are inferential and epistemic in nature. The P-clause is premise expressing and the Q-clause asserts the conclusion which the writer draws from $\mathrm { P }$ on the basis of the immediately preceding co-text (‘After all […] generations.’). Although the actualization of the P-clauses does not license the Q-situation, it does license the inference from $\mathrm { P }$ to $\mathrm { Q }$ with a certain degree of certainty and paves the way for a metalinguistic Q-statement of the type ‘I think/argue/concede/conclude/assume/postulate, it means…’, etc. (2001: 327).

As far as the time settings in the Q-clauses are concerned, although the writer can be said to position herself in all three cases in the historical past, on each occasion the reader is faced with a slight shift in perspective, created by the change in tense and object. Whereas the first conditional question (‘If it was now accepted’) clearly positions the narrator in a future-looking past (‘why not travel to the moon …?’), the second posits the narrative perspective as necessarily both past- and future-looking (‘If it had become possible to communicate over long distances, why not consider the possibility of contact across time …?’). Things change once again with the third (‘If one could capture the exact image … why not that of a spirit?’), which if read on its own, would seemingly allow for a purely metaphysical narrative gaze. Furthermore, the ‘why not’ conjecture employs ideas which seemingly would have been voiced by actors from the narrative or story-time. The writer thus establishes dialogue both through a past–present and an actor–expert overlay.

# 3.3 Voice perspective: the case of art history

In AH the distribution of samples with dominant paradigmatic and narrative voices is more dispersed than in HS, although there is also a significant difference in the corresponding journals (Table 13.3).

The applicability of the CARS model appears far less clear. In a number of samples, I found structural similarities with HS – abrupt shifts from M1 to M3, fusing together of M2 and M3, and reiterative patterns between M3 and M2 – but there are also numerous cases where the model simply seems inappropriate, above all for the Art Journal. This may indeed be due to the fact that introductions in this discipline are far less concerned with actively creating a research space than with attracting/engaging the readership and experimenting with alternative forms of rhetoric. Swales discusses possibilities of this sort in reviewing the critical literature on his earlier CARS model, admitting that ‘promotionalism, other forms of persuasive rhetoric, and extensive metadiscourse have increased in a number of Anglophone journals’ (2004: 244) He adumbrates a ‘CARSalternative model’ or OARO (Open A Research Option) which he sees as particularly suited to softer fields, small discourse communities, unsectioned or unconventionally organized articles, nonantagonistic stance, etc. (2004: 245). This seems to address a number of the difficulties I have found here with the CARS model, but it would be premature to entertain it at this moment as a viable alternative for AH.

Of particular interest is the tendency to what might be called ‘embellished description’, linked to narrative voice in at least one of the journals (25 percent in AJ). Example 4 is a good case of this.

# Example 4

‘Fashioning Cléopâtre: Sonia Delaunay’s New Woman’ – Juliet Bellow (Art Journal 68 (2), 6–25, Summer 2009)

In Abel Faivre’s satirical rendering of its 1913 opening, the spare, neoclassical foyer of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées is set off by the equally sleek, columnar bodies of women milling about. At the far right of this caricature we see two such fashionable specimens. One, though plump and matronly, wears a tight, form-fitting gown whose daringly strapless neckline contrasts with her prim, round spectacles. The other, young and slim, sports a simple, Empire-waist gown and hair-obscuring turban patterned after Paul Poiret’s confections of the moment.(FN1) To these ladies’ left, another finely-attired Parisienne – pearls dripping from her head and neck – surveys this scene. Purposefully striding ahead of her tuxedoed escort, she speaks the cartoon’s caption; ‘Delightful auditorium! And one is seen from all the seats.’(FN2)

The aim of the fine descriptive detail seems to be that of stimulating a vivid visual representation, one which will allow the reader to reconstruct it as ‘real’. In rhetoric, such descriptions are termed hypotyposis, or evidentia, and their reality effect most certainly captivates readers, drawing them into the scene being described. It also, however, desubjectivizes the writer’s voice, offering the impression that reality is speaking for itself. There are never textual markers self-reflexively signaling the writer-as-describer, nor are there traces of interpersonal mitigation, such as hedging. It is therefore not by chance that the writer in Example 4 only entertains the possibility that we are not actually being presented with ‘reality’ but rather with her own subjective reading, which as she herself will inform us, is evidently not only contested by others but may actually go against the thoughts of the cartoonist with the ancillary position of a footnote (FN2 ‘[…] I read this caricature as poking fun at the assertiveness and vanity of modern women. However, it is possible to read this cartoon in various ways, especially given Faivre’s seemingly positive depiction of such New Women in advertising posters of the period.’). Therefore, an important difference with HS arises with respect to the narrative voice used. HS embellishments of scenes and objects can rarely be sustained for long since the very recourse to multiple other voices in the text, both historical and expert, precludes this in presentia effect so typical of AH discourse.

# 4 Conclusions

This chapter has explored how dominant voice forms vary significantly across three disciplines. It has also advanced some hypotheses as to what this variation may imply for the writers in terms of persuasive strategies, engagement with their readerships, and construction of knowledge in ways acceptable to their disciplinary cultures.

The first distinction highlighted – that of paradigmatic and narrative voice – isolates a key difference between the research article introduction in MB and that of HS and AH. The MB samples in my corpus make almost exclusive use of paradigmatic voice, and therefore concentrate principally on producing well-formed arguments which proceed from defining categories and then situating particular items as instances of these. The major focus seems to be the establishment of convincing links which found a purely ‘logical’ justification for the research. I believe two effects can be traced to this:

1. MB writers deemphasize personal or subjective factors in favor of what the dis course community sees as widely recognized scientific procedures. The less personal or intrusive the writer is in the text, the more a sense of objectivity is conveyed, since the writer’s voice is itself seen as being subordinated to the scientific method s/he has followed (cf. Hyland, 2007: 102).   
2. Much more argumentative emphasis is placed on commonalties than on differences. MB writers therefore tend to build upon past findings and knowledge, extending what is already known and consolidated rather than criticizing past findings. This is attested to by the relatively low recourse to contrastives or counter-claiming (4 out of 30) when writers are establishing and occupying their niche.

For HS and AH, where narrative voice plays an important role, further distinctions have to be made. In both disciplines there were a significant number of cases where engagement mechanisms such as rhetorical questions were employed with the clear intent to influence reader identification as well as participation.

What I found to be crucial in HS are the complex workings of voice position and directionality, the weaving of past and present expert and actor voices combined with averral and attribution strategies. Often, as with Example 2, the effect seems to be an embedding of the writer’s voice in the other voices in the text. This makes it easier for her/him to make strong knowledge or truth claims without necessarily being perceived as having played the dominant role in the story’s construction.

Somewhat differently in AH, where the phenomenon of other voices in the text is generally far less dominant, I found what I call voice ‘perspective’ to play an important persuasive role. Frequent writer recourse to the detailed, embellished description of objects and scenes (Example 4) produces a ‘reality effect’, what rhetoricians call hypotyposis or evidentia. The reader is, so to speak, allowed to ‘visualize’ the object/scene ‘as it really is’. The writer-narrator in these moments speaks through an objectivist, universalizing voice (Stern, 2002), orienting and framing the research topic through strong claims which, however, are often not taken as such because they are ascribed to the self-evidence of sensorial description. Interestingly, I have often found a net contrast between the objectivism with which the writer sets up her/his research topic – establishes her/ his territory – and the very tentative way s/he puts forth her/his thesis. Statements like ‘My essay is a modest attempt to grope for a point of entry’(AJ 68 (3): 7) as the writer states her/his goals abound and suggest a subtle and complex shifting of voice positions and effects across perceived disciplinary confines.

# 14 Variation of Stance and Voice across Cultures

Kjersti Fløttum University of Bergen, Norway

# 1 Introduction: the recent tradition of cross-cultural research into academic voice

My point of departure in this chapter, focused on how stance and voice vary across cultures in academic writing, is that these two discursive features are closely related. I will lay special emphasis on voice since it always implies a stance, regardless of how clearly marked the latter may be. The issues I will be addressing (Sections 2–4) are the following: To what extent can we expect to find stance and voice in written academic discourse? What are the cultures that may influence it? Through which linguistic features may stance and voice be expressed? In my concluding remarks (Section 5) I will also raise the question of cultural difference in a world of increasing internationalization. Before discussing all these aspects, however, I would like to review a brief selection of previous work on cultural differences related to stance and voice in one way or another. While there is a large body of literature examining stance and voice across disciplines and genres, research into their cultural variation in academic discourse is relatively modest. One reason for this may be the difficulty of defining what a culture is or could be in this context. I will return to this point later in Section 3.

Although the cross-cultural variation of voice has been investigated by a number of scholars, I have confined my review to the research of Anna Mauranen (1993a), Françoise Salager-Meyer et al. (2003, 2004), Irena Vassileva (1997, 2000, 2001), the KIAP project (see Fløttum et al., 2006, 2008; Fløttum, 2010a), which I coordinate, and the recent publications by Sanderson (2008) and Mauranen et al. (2010).

One of the first and major contributions to the study of voice variation across cultures is the book Cultural Differences in Academic Rhetoric, by Anna Mauranen (1993a). She compares the style of Anglo-American and Finnish scholars, and her chief finding is that the English scientific style is more explicit and direct than the Finnish one. More specifically, Anglo-Americans usually start their papers with their main point(s), whereas the Finns prefer to reserve them for the end. This directness and explicitness of scientific English in contrast with other languages has been substantiated by Vassileva’s stylistic study (2000) on Romance and Slavic, and by that of Fløttum et al. (2006) on French and Norwegian.

Further, the results obtained by Salager-Meyer and associates in two of their several contrastive studies of ‘critical voices’ in academic genres written in English, French and Spanish, provide new insights regarding academic conflict. In the first of them (Salager-Meyer et al., 2003), the authors investigate medical articles published between 1930 and 1995 and conclude that French and Spanish medical writers tend to be more critical and authoritarian than their English-speaking counterparts (for French this discursive pattern has not changed substantially over time). In the second, centred on negative appraisals in academic book reviews (BRs from now on), Salager-Meyer and Alcaraz Ariza (2004: 168) note that ‘[t]he frequency, […] would tend to be language/culture dependent, English- and French-written BRs being less critical than their Spanish counterparts’. However, concerning the quantitative differences between English and French, the percentage of BRs with negative appraisals is slightly higher in French (76 per cent) than in English (70 per cent) (ibid.: 156).

Another landmark in this research area is the comprehensive study of authorial presence in academic writing undertaken by Irena Vassileva (2000), which includes data on four languages in addition to English, namely German, French, Russian and Bulgarian. The stress is on the Bulgarian perspective, in the sense that the other four languages have ‘to varying degrees and at different times in history, influenced and shaped the Bulgarian canon of academic writing’ (2000: 12). She not only studies authorial presence through the use of first person pronouns in single-authored linguistics articles, but also the factor of (non)- nativeness with a corpus of linguistics papers written by Bulgarians in the other four languages. Her findings show a higher frequency of the pronoun ‘I’ in the articles written in English.

Let us now look at some of the results from the KIAP project (Fløttum et al., 2006; Fløttum, 2010a). KIAP is a Norwegian acronym for Cultural Identity in Academic Prose. This project is based on analyses of the KIAP corpus, consisting of 450 research articles (hereafter RAs), taken from refereed journals between the years 1992 and 2003; in total about 3 million words. The articles belong to diverse disciplines ( economics, linguistics, medicine) and are written in three different languages (English, French and Norwegian). The project thus has a double contrastive perspective: discipline and language, and its overarching research questions delve into traces of authors (Self) and other voices (Other) in RAs. Results indicate that discipline is more important than language in the identification of cultural identities, but there are some cultural – or linguistic – differences to regard: English and French, for instance, appear respectively as explicit and non-explicit languages, a fact also observed by Vassileva (2000). Yet – in Norwegian – pronominal use differs somewhat from the trends detected in investigations of other linguistic features, and so Norwegian researchers seem to be less directly present in the text than their English-speaking colleagues, possibly because their discourse community is smaller. According to the KIAP studies, the articles written in Norwegian are close to the English ones, in general the most explicit of all. This may be explained by the geographical proximity of Norway and Great Britain and their historical, political and professional inter-influence.

A more recent and corpus-based study undertaken on cultural differences in academic discourse is Tamsin Sanderson’s 2008 book, about how British, US-American and German scholars use their native language in research articles ‘to construct and express various identities within a defined social group’ and ‘how they interact with their readers and the wider academic community’ (ibid.: 15). Her main results indicate that ‘the British and US-American scholars were more likely than were German scholars to refer to themselves and address the imagined reader’ (ibid.: 275). Finally, it is worthwhile mentioning the paper by Anna Mauranen et al. (2010), which includes a variety of relevant references. Their discussion of the different academic Englishes is particularly interesting in the present context, indicating for example that recent observations suggest that differences between British and American papers have been much diminished.

# 2 Academic discourse in the perspective of ‘rhetoric of science’

In this section I will shortly consider to what extent we can expect to find voice and stance in academic writing. This question relates to the traditional conception of academic discourse as ‘neutral’ and ‘objective’, which has been contested for quite some time (see Berge, 2003, 2008;

Prelli, 1989). Even though there may be substantial differences between disciplines, it is obvious that scientific observations and findings cannot speak by themselves, without any ‘help’ from or any traces of the author(s) behind them. In order to support the view that a genre such as the RA contains traces of voice and stance and thus can be considered as rhetorical, I adopt some of the assumptions presented by Prelli (1989) in his ‘rhetoric of science’: the RA is rhetorical in the sense that it represents a discourse created in order to induce cooperative attitudes and actions, on the one hand, and to give authors the possibility to position themselves in or in relation to a particular discourse community, on the other. This logically implies that the RA is always addressed (i.e. directed to someone) and that even if this manifestation of addressivity may vary in different traditions, the RA constitutes a piece of communication whose final rhetorical aim is to persuade the audience and so become part of the field’s literature and consequently of its deliberation (i.e. of the continuous dialogue in which a writer claims authority as a scholar). In this respect academic writing may in some contexts appear as not very different from political discourse. An example of this scientific and political mix may be the current writing rapidly evolving within the issue of climate change, where voice and stance are essential features (e.g. Fløttum, 2010b).

We commonly consider the communication of new knowledge as the main task of a scientific author, but it may also consist in confirming knowledge that already exists. These two functions can only be accomplished when the research contribution is presented in a rhetorically convincing manner. In Section 4 we will look into rhetorical roles that RA authors may assume – roles which constitute explicit marks of stance – and how they may vary across the language cultures of English, French and Norwegian.

# 3 Various understandings of culture

In the introduction I mentioned some previous studies on cultural differences between academic authors. In this section I will now try to answer the question of what are the cultures that may influence their discourse. My starting point is that texts are not produced in a void but in a context marked by a multitude of factors. The key role played by text in cultural studies is reflected in the following observation:

[T]exts are in themselves one of the main keys to understanding a culture. Texts as cultural products act out relevant social relationships within the culture, and in this way provide keys to understanding themselves as well as other aspects of the culture. (Mauranen, 2001: 53)

It should be further borne in mind that different disciplines often represent different discourse cultures, or in the words of Berge (2008; see also Swales, 1998):

‘Science’ is text culture consisting of different discourse communities with different communicative goals, different textual traditions, different genres, different truth-concepts, different types of interaction with society. (Berge, 2008: 55)

There are then different settings, or cultures, that have an impact on academics and which influence the way the actual text is realized. One is the author’s native language culture, a second is the world of academia, which provides him/her with a general scholarly background; and a third the discipline in which the scientist is situated (see Dahl, 2004). In what follows, I will be focusing on the perspective of language, with which some precautions should be taken.

Academics come to the text with a history as members of a national culture, which entails bringing along a set of values reflected in social hierarchies and educational systems. Language is an obvious component of those values, but also an issue that may be difficult to handle, since some nations may have more than one official language. Two of the publishing languages studied by the KIAP project, English and French, are official in several countries, while Norwegian is used as a native language in Norway only (for more details, see Dahl, 2004 and Section 1.3, developed by Dahl, in Fløttum et al., 2006).

English is accepted as the lingua franca in large parts of the world today and occupies a privileged position in academia (see Mauranen et al., 2010). It is the first language of Britain, the USA, (parts of) Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various other countries around the globe, and although it may become difficult to assume that its native users represent one and the same national culture, their academic writing may display similar features, based primarily on Anglo-American norms. This same situation seems to be valid for the francophone world, with the French writing culture as the standard. So, the adoption of a lingua franca seems to lead to analogous discoursal behaviours, and intercultural studies such as those by Hall and Hall (1990) and Hofstede (2001) have provided evidence that sharing a language often involves sharing general cultural values, but this tendency may be in tension with the politeness conventions underlying the authors’ native languages. Hinds’ (1987) typological study of several languages used communicatively, divides them into two categories: reader-responsible and writer-responsible languages. As to his own culture, Hinds maintains that ‘[t]he desire to write or speak clearly in English permeates our culture’ (Hinds, 1987: 144), while for instance in Japan ‘it is the responsibility of the listener (or reader) to understand what it is the speaker or author had intended to say’ (ibid.). He goes on to claim that ‘[t]his difference in the way of looking at the act of communication permeates the thoughts of anyone who operates as a functioning Japanese-American bicultural’ (ibid.). His ideas are reflected in Mauranen’s discussion of metatext in Finnish and English, where she points at the way the explicit guidance practised by Anglo-American writers, together with frequent signalling of the personal presence of the author, transmits the impression that the reader is invited to take a tour of the text, guided by the writer (Mauranen, 1993b: 16). Summarizing, language is a central dimension of culture and may influence academic discourse. Nevertheless, we should also note that different languages may contain specific traits which are not always possible to explain by reference to cultural variables: certain linguistic constructions may be frequent in one language while less used in another. In addition, there is the issue of comparability, of what aspects can really be contrasted.

# 4 Linguistic features expressing voice and stance

Even though it may be difficult to pinpoint the role of language within the cultural whole influencing academic discourse, previous studies suggest that there are differences related to the use and frequency of certain features in academic discourse across languages. In this section, we will look at some of those linguistic features through which voice and stance are expressed. To do so I will adopt a multi-voiced or polyphonic perspective based on ScaPoLine Theory (Nølke et al., 2004), which has proved particularly fruitful in the analysis of self-projection and alternative voices, whether overtly or covertly manifested. It derives from a conception of language as fundamentally dialogical in nature, inspired by Bakhtin (1970) and Bondi and Silver (2004). The empirical support for the findings I will present are the contrastive studies conducted within the KIAP project (Fløttum et al., 2006; Fløttum, 2008) and involving RAs in English, French and Norwegian from the fields of economics, linguistics and medicine. On the whole, our findings indicate that discipline has more weight than language in the shaping of cultural identities and in the differences within academic discourse, and is a more important variable than language to explain the similarities and differences observed between articles (on disciplinary differences, see also Hyland, 2000). However, some interesting divergences due to language were found. For instance, the use of first person pronouns, which is a primary feature of voice.

The KIAP findings indicate a much higher frequency of the first person singular in English and Norwegian single-authored articles than in the French single-authored ones, but on the other hand, Norwegian singleauthored articles also employ the first person plural pronoun more often than the English articles. Regarding the use of first person plural pronouns in multi-author RAs, the frequencies in English and Norwegian are quite similar, with French articles manifesting a clearly lower ratio of this kind of ‘voice presence’ (for more detail, see Fløttum et al., 2006: 75–9).

There are of course numerous linguistic features which can mark stance in relation to voice (e.g. hedges of different kinds, boosters, attitude mention). I will limit this repertoire to some of the devices studied in the KIAP project.

A trait which indicates that stance and voice are interrelated is what we have called rhetorical roles (Fløttum, 2003a, 2004). These are roles authors may take on when referring to themselves by means of the first person pronoun and which have been identified by investigating the immediate co-text where those pronouns occur (i.e. the verb or verb construction combined with the pronoun and, to some extent, surrounding metatextual expressions). The most prominent roles identified in the KIAP corpus are the following: researcher, writer (or readerguide) and arguer, represented in Examples (1)–(3):

(1) Researcher: Therefore, I assume zero network costs in the foreign market […]. (engecon39)   
(2) Writer/reader-guide: I summarize this result in the following proposition: […]. (engecon44)   
(3) Arguer: I argue that the strongest hypothesis is one which maintains […]. (engling45)

The researcher role is the most frequent in all the articles scrutinized (Fløttum et al., 2006: 92).

If we define stance as the author’s means of conveying judgements, opinions and commitment (see Hyland, 2009: 74), then the clearest stance-marking role is that of the arguer. In a study of RAs within economics and linguistics, we found that Norwegian authors are more writers than arguers and that English-speaking authors are more explicit arguers than the Norwegian ones. Here are some examples:

(4) Norwegian writer:   
Jeg skal nå diskutere noen mulige argumenter […]. (noecon20)   
(‘I will now discuss some possible arguments […].’)   
(5) Norwegian arguer, using ‘vi’ (‘we’) in a single-author article, and hedging by may/can:   
Vi kan derfor konkludere at saliens ikke spiller en avgjørende rolle for DENNE, […]. Vi har sett at betingelsene er såpass komplekse at […]. (noling01)   
(‘We may/can therefore conclude that salience does not play a decisive role for DENNE, […]. We have seen that the conditions are so complex that […].’)

(6) English arguer:

I claim that the two readings of (7) […] are due to interpretation with respect to different times of the matrix tense. (engling01)

The use of first person pronouns and the roles these may assume through the different verb constructions they combine with convey voice and stance related to the Self. However, since in the academic world there is a constant search for truth, or rather negotiation of it, many other voices from immediate and distant contexts are brought in – the Other. To be persuasive, the author of an RA must give the floor to this Other, either explicitly, by attributing the content to sources (with varying degrees of distinctiveness), or implicitly through specific signals, without any clear attribution of source. The resources to express overtly attributed sources (i.e. explicit polyphony) are often reported speech and bibliographical references, whereas the implicit way of giving the floor to alternative voices may be realized through various linguistic markers (see Fløttum, 2005a, b, 2006). Example 7 below illustrates explicit polyphony through the use of bibliographical references and Example 8 implicit polyphony through the marker not:

(7) Blanchard and Watson (1986) and Blanchard and Quah (1989) found evidence that demand shocks were the main source of US fluctuations, but Shapiro and Watson (1988) and Gali (1992) found that supply shocks predominated. (engecon22)

(8) While it was generally believed that trade diversification towards the continental countries was in Ireland’s interest, this was not a prime motive for breaking the sterling link. (engecon28)

Explicit polyphony is the reference practice in RAs, which spell out the source of the voice or point of view presented (Fløttum, 2003b; Salager-Meyer, 1999), as in Example 7. The analysis of RA citations has yielded significant insights into the differences between disciplines and languages (Fløttum et al., 2006). In the KIAP RAs corpus, for example, bibliographical references are more frequent in English and Norwegian than in French (for more thorough explanations see Fløttum et al., 2008). However, traces of the Other may be found in more subtle, linguistic configurations and the explicit and the implicit are often interwoven (Fløttum 2006), as in fact in Example 7. To grasp the meaning of this sequence, it is not sufficient to interpret the function of the four explicit voices represented by the given references. We have to take into consideration another level of polyphony, implicit but clearly signalled by the adversative but, which signposts a contrastive and concessive relation between the two points of view introduced. The connective but judges the first statement as not valid (i.e. ‘Blanchard and Watson (1986) and Blanchard and Quah (1989) found evidence that …’), making the second one prevail (i.e. the one about Shapiro and Watson) and structuring the argumentation as a mild form of polemic. Likewise, the negation not in Example 8 follows the polemic tone already set in by the contrastive connective while and signals a disapproving attitude towards the point of view exposed. The impersonal construction it was generally believed does not indicate whether the author was part of the ‘general belief’ represented, but what is clear is that the author rebuts this belief was ‘a prime motive for breaking the sterling link’ (see Example 8). It seems reasonable to think that the point of view refuted is attributed to a source that may also share the general belief represented in the subordinate clause, a voice the author clearly is not part of.

While the negation not in its polemic meaning always points to an ‘opponent’ (to whom the refuted point of view is attributed), the concessive but always points to a source whose point of view is accepted, but not judged valid in the here and now of the text. These two remarks concerning implicit polyphony are important for the interpretation of the text as a whole, and in relation to its context.

The former account has given an idea of the research interests of the KIAP team: besides studying the reference practice of explicit polyphony, we focus on the implicit polyphony manifested by markers such as not and but and their counterparts in French and Norwegian. With regard to cultural variation, we observed that negation is clearly more used in Norwegian than in English and French; the same general picture holds for the adversative connective but (and its counterparts in French and Norwegian). Whether this means that Norwegian articles are more dialogical and even polemical than English and French RAs is an open question to be further studied, and which could for example be related to Salager-Meyer et al’s (2003) studies on critical voices.

So far we have seen that the scientific activity presented in RAs can be studied in rhetorical terms, with emphasis on the argumentative dimension. Research authors take a stance – or position themselves, both explicitly (i.e. by assuming different author roles) and implicitly (i.e. with different polyphonic markers). In addition they bring in other voices. These interplays represent a complex mode of interaction that is essential for the understanding of academic discourse and involves both readers and researchers, who may be assigned roles. In light of all this, and despite their apparent monological nature, we may view RAs as polyphonic dramas where authors interact with other parties performing a double function: self-positioning and control. As they position themselves by expressing their attitudes and viewpoints, RA writers may give the floor to other voices implicitly or explicitly, creating a multivoiced space.

To sum up, with the empirical support of the KIAP corpus and on the basis of the devices studied there, we may point to the following cultural differences (Fløttum et al., 2008): authors of English articles are overtly present in their texts; they are reader-friendly (guiding the readers through the text by explicit indications about what is or what will be done) and relatively polemical. Single authors, in addition, tend to be $I .$ -users, as in the utterance ‘In this section, I will discuss …’. Authors of Norwegian articles are in many respects similar to authors of English RAs in that they are visible and reader-friendly, although they appear to be more argumentative and polemical and manifest a more collective voice. In conclusion, Norwegian single authors tend to be we-users – often using the inclusive we as in ‘We see that …’. In contrast, authors of French articles are relatively ‘absent’. They provide little reader guidance and are indirectly polemical. French single authors tend to be one-users, like in ‘On peut constater …’ (‘One can observe …’); however, it should be remembered that the French indefinite pronoun on has a much wider scope and is much more frequent than the English one (see Fløttum et al., 2007).

# 5 Concluding remarks: towards a one-culture academic discourse?

In this chapter we have seen that stance and voice do vary across cultures, although the reduced repertoire of languages and features examined here should be expanded in subsequent studies to offer broader perspectives. We have also seen that research authors may make their presence visible (voice) and position themselves (stance) explicitly or implicitly, that is, by taking on different author roles or by using different polyphonic markers. Our hypothesis has been that the identification of different voices and their sources reveals relations (such as refusal or acceptance) between the authors and those Others they are integrating in their own message, and that this interaction is essential to the interpretation of the text as a whole. This approach has also cast some light on the differences between language cultures (in our case through the study of RAs written in English, French and Norwegian). But in this last section I would also like to pose the question of how much cultural variation there can be in our world of increasing internationalization, where English is such a powerful lingua franca in the scientific environment: under its strong influence, when we talk about norms or standards (e.g. for the RA), these mostly reproduce AngloAmerican models. In spite of this fact, however, Mauranen et al. affirm that ‘there is no universal standard of “good writing”’ (2010: 638). Thus, we could ask ourselves how much this dominance affects academic writing in other languages. To what extent, then, is there a process of standardization influenced by English? This question is relevant in the discussion of maintaining national writing conventions for academic discourse. Let us take Norwegian as an example: a language (with its two standards) which has an official status in a very small country. The dilemma often felt by the Norwegian researcher is, on the one hand, to position him-/herself at the international research front, and on the other, to cultivate and develop academic Norwegian through publications in this language, but only researchers from Scandinavian countries would have access to it. In addition, there are political questions involved, depending on the recognition a country gives to national and international journals and publishers. Whether or not ‘the use of English by non-native English speakers represents a threat for local identities and scholarly traditions’ (Mauranen et al., 2010: 646), is an issue which still needs investigation.

One observation which can be read out of the KIAP findings (Fløttum et al., 2006) is that standardization is stronger within disciplines than within languages. However, the individual differences in the languages studied are in fact considerable. At the same time, it is clear that RA authors writing in English and those writing in Norwegian have more in common between them than with those writing in French, and that the influence of English academic discourse on Norwegian is unquestionable, something unsurprising given the long collaborative tradition between Norway and Anglo-American countries. The authors writing in French, on the contrary, distinguish themselves quite clearly from their English- and Norwegian-writing colleagues. The great value given for centuries to the French culture and language by the francophone world may partly explain this.

To conclude, more research is needed on the question of linguistic and disciplinary standardization. The features deserving attention are numerous, and central among them are the traces of voice and stance, the study of which becomes all the more important as our society is increasingly reliant on scientific knowledge.

# 15 The Voice of Scholarly Dispute in Medical Book Reviews, 1890–20101

All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident. (Arthur Schopenhauer)

# 1 Introduction

It is now generally accepted that synchronic studies can benefit from, be enhanced and informed by diachronic considerations which help us understand why specialized languages have come to be as they are. ‘History is who we are and why we are the way we are’, said the US ‘celebrity’ historian, David McCullough. In that sense, Bazerman (1988) claims that it is necessary to understand why certain forms of expression arise, why they evolve and why they disappear. He further stresses that it is only through the analysis of language as a historical phenomenon that one can understand the rhetoric of today’s scientific discourse. Along the same lines, Atkinson (1996: 334) forcefully remarks that ‘the study of scientists’ communicative practices across historical times is a crucial aspect in the study of science’. Hyland (2000) echoes these opinions by asserting that diachronic analyses of scientific discourse are an important way of looking at the constitutive relationship between writers and their texts in the sense that they show that language and communities are mutually entailed and constituted.

This is probably why there has lately been an increasing interest in the analysis of scientific issues and texts from a diachronic standpoint.

This interest is reflected in a wide array of publications that have analyzed scientific texts either from a micro- and macro-linguistic perspective (e.g. Gunnarsson, 1997), from a more sociologically oriented standpoint (e.g. Atkinson, 1996; Bazerman, 1988; Gross et al., 2002) or, more strictly, from a systemic functional linguistics angle (e.g. Banks, 2008).

Using many of the procedures of rhetorical and register analysis, the above-mentioned diachronic research has been able to reveal important changes in several academic genres (although mainly in the sacrosanct research article) and to underline how the writers’ rhetorical strategies have changed as a response to the needs, conceptions and practices of the scientific community.

Through the analysis of the evolution of a certain number of rhetorical features pertaining to a genre that is increasingly being seen as an important locus of disciplinary discourse research, viz. the academic book review, here we would like to further illustrate how instructive the diachronic exploration of scientific discourse can be. We shall focus on the rhetorical evolution of a specific socio-pragmatic phenomenon that is an ‘integral feature of the book review genre’ (Hyland, 2000: 61) and that represents the ‘common thread that holds the genre together’ (Giannoni, 2002: 356), a phenomenon without which, it is worthwhile underlining, there would be no science at all. We are here referring to academic criticism (hereafter abbreviated as AC), an element that is essential to the dynamic process of scientific knowledge construction and that has received several ‘labels’ in the literature (see Lorés, 2009 for an overview).

The present study then builds on the findings of the previously published research on scholarly book reviews (hereafter abbreviated as BR(s)) by examining the evolution of the AC-related variables we mention in Section 2 below. Its originality lies not only in the wider range of variables studied but also in the methods used to analyse our raw data (see Section 3 below).

# Academic criticism: a working definition

We define an AC as a negative remark uttered by a book reviewer towards the stance adopted by a book author/editor or towards a given aspect or sub-aspect of the book under review ‘in relation to a criterion of evaluation with a higher or lower degree of generality’ (Moreno and Suárez, 2008: 18). This means that ACs are not identified as grammatical units but as functional/semantic ones. i.e. as ‘any structural unit, irrespective of its lexico-grammatical configuration, that contains both the (sub)-aspect commented upon and what is said about it’ (cf. Thetela, 1997; Lorés, 2009). Two examples:

1. Dr. Gant is too much inclined to radical operations (AC1) and unfortunately pays insufficient attention to conservative treatments (AC2) (1896). 2. The discussions are balanced and critical (positive evaluation), but, in our opinion, they are not critical enough (AC1) (2008).

In Example 1 above, we have two ACs, the first one (AC1) being made up of nine words and the second (AC2) of six words. By contrast, in Example 2, we have two evaluative acts: a positive speech act (the first independent clause) and a negative one (the second independent clause or AC1). As we said before, we will only deal here with negatively critical elements such as the two clauses of Example 1 and the second independent clause of Example 2 (‘they are not critical enough’).

# 2 Corpus and variables

We analysed the evolution of ACs in a corpus of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { B R s }$ published in English-medium leading medical journals in three distinct periods, each one made up of 50 BRs: the closing years of the nineteenth century (1890–1900 or Period A), the mid-twentieth century (1950–60 or Period B) and the first decade of the twenty-first century (2000–10 or Period C), amounting to a total of 71,065 running words. We thus adopted here a genre-based approach, which has been recognized as ‘the most developed and comprehensive rhetorical theory to address writing in recent times’ (Dias et al., 1999: 18).

The analysis was entirely based on paper copies of the 150 BRs. The first step was to carefully read each BR several times so as to identify all instances of ACs. This done, we examined two categories of preestablished variables related to the different ACs recorded in each BR: (1) 17 quantitative or numerical variables whose frequency of occurrence could be counted (cf. Section 2.1 below) and (2) 4 categorical or qualitative ones whose frequency of occurrence could not be counted (cf. Section 2.2 below). These latter were dichotomic (i.e. they answered a yes/no question).

# 2.1 Quantitative/numerical variables (17 items)

(a) The length of the BR itself or the number of running words making up each BR.

(b) The AC itself: how frequent and how long is it? We counted the number of ACs and the number of running words making up the ACs recorded in each BR.

(c) The voicing (or ‘volume’) of the AC: was it direct or epistemically hedged? In Example 2, the AC is hedged by means of the expression ‘in our opinion’. In Example 3 below (italics added), the AC is hedged by means of the epistemic verb ‘to seem’ and the modal ‘might’, whereas the AC voiced in Example 4 (‘a view which is erroneous’) is direct.

3. Some chapters will seem unsatisfactory and incomplete to the general practitioners. Further criticism might be made upon certain chapters … on the ground of imperfect classification. (1956) 4. In the chapter on special diagnosis, the statement is found that the normal glands are surrounded by connective tissue corpuscles, a view which is erroneous. (1899)

Moreover, in order to grade the strength of the book reviewers’ feelings, that is, to assess the extent to which they commit themselves to their AC or to which they ‘turn up or lower the volume’ (Martin, 2000), we also recorded the number of attitude markers or emotionally charged expressions, such as ‘amazingly’, ‘with regret’, ‘unfortunately’ (see Example 1 above), ‘surprisingly’, and of emphatic expressions or boosters (cf. Hyland, 2000; Lafuente Millán, 2008; Tse and Hyland, 2009), such as ‘greatly’, ‘definitely’, ‘too much’ (see Example 1 above), ‘very’, ‘undoubtedly’, ‘strongly’, ‘extremely’, ‘absolutely’.

(d) The location of the AC: was it voiced at the beginning, the middle or the end of the BR?

(e) The ‘judge’ (the book reviewer) presence in the BR. This refers to the way the book reviewer uses personal pronouns as mechanisms to project his voice onto the text: Does he refer to himself by means of the first person singular subject and object pronoun $\mathrm { { ^ { \prime } I / m e ^ { \prime } } }$ , the inclusive ‘we’, the exclusive ‘we’, the indefinite pronoun ‘one’ or the nominal phrase ‘this reader/reviewer’? By inclusive ‘we’ we mean the first person plural subject and object pronoun (‘we’/’us’) that refer both to the authoring scholar (the book reviewer) and the reader binding ‘writer and reader together as members of a disciplinary in-group’ (Hyland, 2002: 35). By contrast, the exclusive ‘we’ specifically excludes the addressee and only refers to the authoring scholar(s) (see Kuo, 1999; Lafuente Millán, 2008).

(f) Was the target of AC an animate agent (the book author/editor) or an inanimate entity (a book chapter, the whole book)?

# 2.2 Categorical/qualitative variables (four yes/no items)

(a) The visibility/invisibility of the book reviewer. If the book reviewer did not identify himself in the BR by means of the devices mentioned in (e) above, then he was classified as ‘invisible’.

(b) Presence of sarcasm/irony in voicing the ACs.

# 3 Data analysis

The above-mentioned variables were recorded in each BR according to the first two authors’ interpretative skills. Ambiguous and doubtful cases were measured against the interpretation provided by a Spanishspeaking specialist informant, a medical doctor fluent in reading and writing English. Throughout the process of data recording, a close reading of the immediate co-text and careful consideration of the larger rhetorical context were taken into account.

The raw data obtained were analysed with two different methods usefully complementing each other: on the one hand, a mathematical model called ‘principal component analysis’ (PCA, see below) that normalizes the raw data and indicates gross patterns or trends, and, on the other, close contextual/analytical readings to explore the finer texture, the meaning and the implications of these trends. The PCA (see below) was run by means of the STAT-ICTF program.

Through a PCA, a table of quantitative data (the frequency of the 21 above-mentioned variables in each one of the 150 BRs examined) is reduced to a set of graphs that highlights the similarities and differences among the observed individuals (the 150 BRs). These similarities and differences are of course shown in the initial data recording table, but, because of the size of the table – a simple listing of numbers (21 variables recorded in 150 BRs) – these similarities and differences cannot be readily appreciated. On the graphs (see Results, Section 4 below) each BR block (A, B, C) of 50 BRs each is represented by a point in a multidimensional space. Similarly, the variables are characterized by their distribution in the three blocks (Saporta, 1990).

# 4 Results: variable distribution around the axes

When reading the graphs one should keep in mind that the further a variable is from the centre of the circle of correlation, the more

representative it is, i.e. the more it characterizes the block – A, B or C – it is associated with.

# 4.1 Numerical variables (Figure 15.1)

Figure 15.1 clearly shows that the numerical variables can be divided into three distinct groups:

1. Group 1, made up of four variables, those on the upper part of the plane: inanimate, the personal pronoun ‘I’, the nominal phrase ‘this reader’, and the inclusive ‘we’.   
2. Group 2, made up of four variables, those near the centre of the circle of correlation: the pronoun ‘one’, ‘end’, ‘hedged’ and ‘begin’.   
3. Group 3, made up of nine variables, those on the left-hand side/ lower part of the plane: ‘number of ACs’, ‘direct’, ‘mid’, ‘emotion’, ‘BR length’, ‘AC length’, ‘animate’, ‘booster’ and exclusive ‘we’.

Figure 15.1 also indicates the position of Block A (end-of-nineteenth-century BRs), Block B (mid-twentieth-century BRs) and Block C (beginningof-twenty-first-century BRs). It clearly shows that Blocks A and C sit in stark contrast, whereas Block B is closer to Block C than it is to Block A.

The combined representation of the three blocks (A, B and C) and of the 17 numerical variables allows us to state that Block A is characterized by those variables making up Group 3, Block C by those variables making up Group 1, and that Block B is not featured by any specific group of numerical variables at all, but rather by the absence of the numerical variables that characterize Block A.

![](img/832e471180e78089822a4fed108cf345c5b971681b8d78a0db4cfdd5def32276.jpg)  
Figure 15.1 Numerical variables: AC: number of academic conflicts; Anim: animate; Boost: boosters; DCT: direct; EMO: emotion; ex we: exclusive ‘we’; Inan: inanimate; In we: inclusive ‘we’; read: This reader, this reviewer

Regarding the four numerical variables of Group 2 (‘end’, ‘begin’, ‘hedged’ and ‘one’), Figure 15.1 shows that they are situated near the centre of the circle of correlation, which means that they are not well represented. In other words, they cannot be said to characterize any block in particular.

# 4.2 Categorical variables (Figure 15.2)

The first thing that strikes the eye when reading Figure 15.2 is the extreme position of the ‘irony’ variable. It is indeed located on the far left-hand side of the plane, whereas its opposite ‘no irony’ is found on the right-hand side of the plane. The ‘visible’ variable is associated with Block A, but it is not that far from Block C, whereas the ‘invisible’ variable is encountered on the right-hand side of the plane, near Block B.

We can thus conclude that ‘irony’ and ‘visibility’ characterize Block A, whereas ‘no irony’ characterizes blocks B and C.

# 4.3 The projection of the 150 individuals on the plane (Figure 15.3)

Figure 15.3 shows the projection of the 150 individuals (the 150 BRs) onto the plane. It can be seen that the BRs making up Block A are much

Figure 15.3 Projection of the 150 individuals (book reviews) onto the plane: Block A: 1–50; Block B: 51–100; Block C: 101–150

more spread over the plane than are those making up blocks B and C which both form two more homogeneous groups.

# 5 Discussion

Our results convincingly show that medical BRs of Block A (those published at the end of the nineteenth century) in many respects stand in sharp contrast with the BRs published during Block C (beginning of the twenty-first century) and with Block B (mid-twentieth century) whose distinctive trait, as we have seen, is rather the absence of specific features (especially those numerical and categorical variables present in Block A) than the presence of any distinctive feature in particular. Moreover, the fact that Block A BRs were found to be spread over the plane means that they form a much more heterogeneous group than their block B and C counterparts. This is why we will organize our discussion by comparing these blocks.

# 5.1 The book review length and the number and length of academic conflicts

BR length, number of ACs and AC length are among the best represented variables (those furthest from the centre of correlation). Indeed, not only the number of ACs but also their length was found to be a characteristic of the BRs from Block A. This can be explained by the fact that nineteenth-century book reviewers tended to use the BR as a ‘rhetorical platform’ (Tse and Hyland, 2009: 118), not only to report long verbatim quotes from the book they were reviewing (SalagerMeyer, 2010) but also to explain, in great detail, how and why their opinions differed from that of the book author.

Besides, nineteenth-century book reviewers used the BR as a floor from which to make their voice about related topics audible. In other words, they used to make long critical digressions about issues that were not directly related to the criticisms uttered. It was not unusual, for example, to find one- or even two-page-long ACs in a BR from Block A. This was never found in book reviews from Block B or C, thus corroborating in a sense the previous fairly robust research finding that today’s academic BRs contain more praise than blame (Hyland, 2000; Shaw, 2009; Moreno and Suárez, 2009). In a sense, then, nineteenth-century medical BRs resemble today’s philosophy BRs that were found to be much longer and discursive than their biology counterparts (cf. Tse and Hyland, 2009).

We should finally keep in mind that at the end of the nineteenth century, space/word limit was not an issue for scientific journal editors. As a consequence, the book reviewer felt free to include as much tangential information and be as verbose/critical as he wanted. What is more, books were then the main means of knowledge dissemination in all disciplines (Gross et al., 2002; Salager-Meyer, 2010) and were not competing with research papers or case reports for print space. Today, the situation is quite different, and medical BRs are relegated to the last section of the journal because, as the Publishing Research Consortium recently reported, researchers in all disciplines and across the world rate journal articles as the most important type of information, to the point that the future of BRs, at least in the medical field, is uncertain. In addition, from the journal’s perspective, the BR makes no contribution to journal impact factor (Lee et al., 2010)

# 5.2 The volume of the judge’s critical stance

# 5.2.1 Direct vs hedged

Another very well-represented variable that characterizes BRs from Block A is ‘direct’, which means that the majority of the ACs recorded during that period were unhedged, thereby undermining the book author’s credibility. Examples such as the two following abound in Block A BRs:

5. The chapter on puerperal septicemia is unnecessarily complicated and the kernel of truth lost in masses of old ideas. (1895)

6. It is the work of about sixty contributors and presents many of the faults of a book prepared in that manner. … Practically, such a book contains numerous weak articles, much repetition, and lacks unity and oneness of purpose…. The editor has failed in many directions. (1897)

As a matter of fact, very few ACs were hedged in our whole BR corpus. This is evinced by the fact that the ‘hedge’ variable was found near the centre of the circle of correlation, which indicates that it is not characteristic of any particular period/block. This stands in contrast with other genres, such as the scientific research article – at least that written in English – where hedges have been found to be quite frequent because they help writers to ‘express tentativeness and possibility’ (cf. Hyland, 1996: 433), thus making their subjective opinion more acceptable to the reader. Not so in BRs: there book reviewers are generally direct in voicing their ACs and, unlike research article authors, have apparently never been preoccupied by protecting their reputation as scientists. We must say that BRs do not rank high in the hierarchical scale of professional scholarship, and academic institutions rarely, if ever, give their scholars credit for publishing BRs (Lee et al., 2010).

Although hedges were quite few, it is worth mentioning that modal/ semi-modal and epistemic verbs were the favoured hedging device in Block A BRs, whereas expressions such as ‘in our/my opinion/experience’ were more frequent than modal verbs in blocks B and C, as Examples 7 and 8 illustrate (see also Example 2 above):

7. Dr. Adams’ directions are clear and practical, though we may differ in the execution of the details. (1896)   
8. It seems to us that allotting of space to the different subjects has not been entirely judicious. (1899)

At any rate, as Hyland (1998) rightly argues, while hedges have an epistemic and affective function in knowledge-making genres, their principal purpose in review genres is to mitigate the interpersonal damage of critical comments.

# 5.2.2 Emotion, boosters and irony/sarcasm

These three variables were clearly associated with the ACs recorded in Block A, where emotional involvement was mainly expressed by means of adverbs such as ‘amazingly’, ‘unfortunately’ and the verb ‘to regret’ (Examples 9 and 10):

9. The opinion of American surgeons is unfortunately not expressed by Dr. Alligham, and we regret to have it appear as being so in an American book. (1899)   
10. The nutritive disturbances of rickets should not be overlooked, but regrettably physicians do not seem to realize their severity and the resulting damage to the system. (1897)

Boosters are frequently seen as rhetorical strategies whose core function is complementary to that of hedges which consists in qualifying the commitment to the truth of the proposition uttered by the speaker/writer (Tse and Hyland, 2009; Hyland, 2011). They were quite frequent in late nineteenth-century BRs which used them to reinforce the image of the expert writer and project an image of aptitude and (over)- confidence (see Examples 11 and 12 below):

11. Here lies our chief criticism. The abridgment is too great and too much has been assumed as to the reader’s knowledge. (1899) 12. The subject of puerperal fever is certainly not so intricate as the author would lead us to believe; it is certainly not due to zymotic causes. (1895) (This last sentence is written in italics in the original so as to place even more emphasis upon the scholarly dispute.)

The discourse of Examples 11 and 12 is a categorical discourse of assurance that leaves readers in no doubt as to the worth of the judge’s robust stance. Having said that, if we consider that nineteenth-century BRs were written by men, and even though we did not regard the gender factor, our results tend to echo the finding of Tse and Hyland (2009) who report that males use more boosters in academic writing than females. Few boosters were found in today’s BRs, probably because an appropriate degree of courtesy is now considered necessary and because libel laws apply. Today boosters must also be used with caution if book reviewers do not want to sound as if they are making too great an imposition on the reader.

Nineteenth-century book reviewers were also quite ironic and sarcastic, another distinctive feature of the ACs recorded at that time. Examples, like the one below from 1899, abound. For lack of space, we will limit ourselves to just one example:

13. Psychiatrists and psychologists ought to read this book, even if only to be enraged.

# 5.2.3 The ‘bench of the accused’

The difference here is clear too. At the end of the nineteenth century, the ‘bench of the accused’ was occupied by an animate agent: the book author/editor, as Examples 1, 6 and 7 above illustrate. This does not imply that a chapter or the book itself could not be found ‘guilty’ of the flaws mentioned in the BR, it did occur (see Examples 3 and 4 above), but, as a whole, authors were the guilty ones. Needless to say that such a rhetorical strategy was very face-threatening to the book author, even when the AC was hedged as in Example 14 below:

14. We regret that Dr. Rae has not thought it necessary in such a treatise as this, to introduce and criticize some of the later ideas on the pathology and treatment urged by many of the Continental American authorities. (1898)

By contrast, in Block C it was most of the time an inanimate entity that was found guilty of the flaws mentioned in the BR, as Examples 15 and 16 instantiate. The AC is somewhat softened, then, by the fact that the AC target is an impersonal/inanimate object:

15. The chapter on neurosurgical approaches does not clearly explain the indications for surgery. (2007)   
16. The book also lacks any comment on the occurrence of Parkinson’s disease in young adults and fails to mention the genomic impact of the dopaminergic agonists. (2008)

The above examples clearly illustrate the progressive objectivization and impersonalization of scientific writing that has also been mentioned by previous research in other academic genres, such as the research article and research article abstracts (e.g. Atkinson, 1996; Gross et al., 2002; Lorés, 2008).

# 5.2.4 The judge’s presence: from expert to ordinary reader

Exploring the pragmatic functions that pronouns fulfil in the instances found, and following Tang and Suganthi’s (1999) cline, we observed that, when visible, book reviewers do not use pronouns as ‘architects of the text’ nor as ‘recounters of the research process’, but as ‘opinion holders’ or ‘originators’.

According to our findings, it is in Block A where the judge’s voice is most clearly audible, and this ‘audibility’ or visibility manifested itself through the extensive use of the ‘exclusive we’ personal pronoun (Kuo, 1999; Hyland, 2005). It underscores the strong authorial voice, the persuasive authority and credibility of the book reviewer who takes full responsibility for his claims. Example 17 illustrates this point quite well:

17. We wish we could share Munde’s enthusiasm in regard to Alexander’s operation, but, as we have frequently stated, our results are the very reverse of his. (1898)

In this sense, we fully agree with Hyland (2001) when he states that the use of the exclusive ‘we’ by single authors is an expression of dominance created by the distancing that the majestic (the royal ‘we’) or authoritative plural produces. It could be argued that the pronoun referred to several book reviewers. Not so, because back then, BRs were written by one reviewer only (even today, it is rare for BRs to be written by several reviewers although it is more frequent than it was back in the nineteenth century).

By contrast, a close analysis of today’s BRs shows that reviewers identify themselves through three linguistic means or self-mention markers (Hyland, 2001: (1) the first personal pronoun ‘I’ (Example 18), (2) the expression ‘This reader/reviewer’ (Example 19), or (3) the ‘inclusive we’ (Example 20). Here are a few examples drawn from Block C BRs:

18. I was also disappointed that the clinical aspects received relatively little space. (2008)   
19. This reviewer believes that the figures are often poorly labeled and difficult to interpret. (2007)   
20. Contrary to what is stated in Chapter 3, we all know that this treatment is not the panacea. (2006)

By resorting to the inclusive ‘we’ today’s ‘judges’ presuppose a certain amount of knowledge (usually disciplinary) on the part of readers and bring them into the text as knowledgeable members of their disciplinary community. They thus align themselves with their reading peers as co-members sharing understandings and values and pursuing similar objectives. By using ‘I’ or ‘this reviewer/reader’, the ‘judge’ is no longer the assertive expert talking on behalf of the scientific community as it was in the nineteenth century, but the voice of an ordinary reader. This use of the first personal pronoun somewhat tones down the criticism. As Hyland and Diani (2009: 11) point out, personal attribution conveys the limitation of the criticism, representing it as ‘the writer’s individual opinion rather than the objective characteristic of the volume’.

It is in Block A where the judge is most clearly visible and in Block B (mid-twentieth century) where it is was most invisible (i.e. not linguistically represented by any personal pronoun at all). The fact that the writer is almost totally invisible in Block B BRs leads us to conclude that it is not only the discipline or the language culture which influences the degree with which writers project themselves in their texts, but that the time factor also plays an important role in the sense that it dictates the choice of more or less impersonal mechanisms to present their standpoints. Hence, when Hyland (2011: 28) points out that any individual’s presentation and interpretation of self varies from one situation to another according to the ‘purpose of the encounter, the audience, and the individual’s relationship with that audience’, the time dimension or historical context should be added to the list of variables that enact such self-projection in academic writing.

# 5.3 The position of criticism within the book review

As we said before, not much can be concluded about the position of the AC in the BR over time, except that they are mostly found in the middle of BRs, especially in Block A. The other two possible locations (at the beginning or at the end) were rare, probably because the latter positions are much more threatening to the book author. This corroborates the findings of other researchers who found that critical remarks at the end of a BR are an infrequent phenomenon because reviewers tend to close their reviews by reminding the reader of the positive rather than the negative points (Gea Valor, 2000; Moreno and Suárez, 2009) in order to project an overall positive impression of the book under evaluation.

Example 21 is an instance of an AC that opens the BR, and Example 22 illustrates an AC as a closing move, but again, both positions were found to be quite infrequent in our whole corpus (note the hedge in Example 21 and the emotional adverb in Example 22, both making the ACs less face-threatening to the book author):

21. The title of the book is somewhat misleading. The pieces do each deal with some aspect of science, but they do not quite add up to a ‘panorama of 25 centuries of scientific thought and method’. The articles are not all of a type. (1958)   
22. Regrettably, the book will fail to increase the non-psychiatric clinician knowledge. (1959)

# 6 Conclusion

This diachronic study of ACs in medical BRs has shown that latenineteenth-century BRs are not only longer and more critical than midtwentieth- and early-twenty-first-century BRs, but more heterogeneous. There is also evidence that book reviewers were more visible and ‘audible’ in late-nineteenth-century BRs than book reviewers from blocks B and C, and that the way they projected authorial self has changed over time. Indeed, early book reviewers showed a greater willingness to make bold and emotional statements and boost their critical arguments than their later counterparts, thus highlighting a more personal and engaging style. Moreover, the voice of late-nineteenth-century book reviewers was that of assertive experts, whereas that of their beginningof-twenty-first-century counterparts is that of ordinary readers. Finally, an increasing depersonalization or objectivization has been observed in the entities accused of the flaws mentioned in the BRs.

We hope that this study brings new insight to the evolution of the expression of written scholarly dispute, an aspect that is crucial to scientific writing. As Sir Karl Popper (1959: 54) indeed wrote in The Logic of Scientific Discovery: ‘The wrong view of science betrays itself in the craving to be right; for it is not his possession of knowledge, of irrefutable truth, that makes the man of science, but his persistent and recklessly critical quest for truth.’

# 16 Epilogue

Deborah Cameron Oxford University, UK

A few years ago, one of the peer reviewers of an article I had submitted to an academic journal upbraided me (or rather, ‘the author’) for making insufficient reference to the work of Deborah Cameron. The omission was, of course, deliberate: the journal’s policy of anonymous reviewing required authors to minimize clues to their identity, including citations of their previous publications. But I was surprised, and slightly piqued, to know that this strategy had worked so well. I like to think I have a distinctive voice; yet a reviewer who was clearly familiar with my work had not even suspected that s/he might be reading my words. My reaction made me realize that I had expected to be recognized, and that unconsciously I must have wanted to be.

This story may not reflect well on me, but I tell it here because it illustrates a dilemma faced by all academic writers, and by teachers of academic writing: how to negotiate – and help students to negotiate – the competing claims of self-assertion and self-effacement, individual creativity and institutional authority, personal commitments and community expectations. Those tensions are touched upon, implicitly or explicitly, by many contributors to this volume. They have also been a perennial preoccupation in my own career as a writer and a teacher.

The academic culture in which I learned to write laid emphasis on self-effacement as a mark of both intellectual and social decorum. Injecting one’s own personality into writing was discouraged, not only on the grounds that it was unscholarly, but also because it was seen as somehow vulgar. As a graduate student at Oxford in the early 1980s, I was presented with a style guide for writers of doctoral theses which seemed to sum up the prevailing attitude: it quoted Madame de Staël’s dictum ‘le moi est haissable’. Eventually I realized this was a pretentious way of saying: ‘do not write in the first person singular’. It was an injunction I ignored, then as now, and not only because I found the manner of expression insufferably elitist. For me, influenced by feminist and other ‘radical’ ideas in circulation at the time, the proscription of $I$ symbolized a whole epistemology: it stood for the idea of knowledge as disinterested, and of the writer as an objective arbiter of knowledge with no particular standpoint or personal investment. Rejecting that view as a mystification, I also rejected the conventions of writing that made it seem natural and unquestionable.

There were academic writers who went further. Among feminist scholars in the 1980s, there was interest in the idea put forward by French-speaking theorists like Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray and Hélène Cixous, that writing expressed an inherently masculine subjectivity, and so denied women writers an authentically female voice. Some experimented with écriture féminine, ‘feminine writing’, which sought to break away from the ‘masculine’ norms of linear syntax and rational argument. Others set out to construct a distinctively female voice by weaving references to personal experiences, emotions and bodily sensations into their texts. Personally I steered clear of these strat egies, for both political and aesthetic reasons (I like my feminism non- essentialist, my arguments rational and my prose as clear and readable as I can make it). But even where I did not care for the kind of writing it produced, there was something I found liberating about this challenge to established conventions.

Of course, the challenge did not amount to a wholesale revolution. Its scale was small, and it did not extend to all disciplines. The feminist experiments just described, for instance, were largely confined to writing in the arts and humanities: scientists had much less freedom to diverge from the prescribed norms (this book suggests that the same is true today). But in some parts of the academy, ‘alternative’ ways of writing were sufficiently salient to show that it was possible to diverge. The commandments in style guides were not timeless truths carved on the proverbial tablets of stone; their legitimacy and their value could be questioned.

That kind of questioning was something I was keen to bring into my teaching as well as my own practice as a writer. In Britain, where I began my career, teaching students to write was not a formalized responsibility for most university teachers: though inevitably it was part of what we did, it was largely an ad hoc and unreflective activity. But at the end of the 1980s I spent two years working in the USA, at a college where all members of the English department were expected to teach freshman composition. This was not an ad hoc or informal practice, but on the contrary a highly codified one. The pedagogic practices which constituted it, at least where I worked, were grounded in a particular theory or ideology of writing: essentially, the ‘expressivist’ approach described by Christine Tardy (Chapter 3) as ‘especially common among writing teachers and students’ (p. 36). It was impressed on me that we were not there to do what some of our colleagues in other departments would have preferred us to do – train students to produce ‘good writ$\mathrm { i n g ^ { \prime } }$ by mechanically correcting their errors and deviations. Our job was rather to enable students to express their ideas in their own authentic voices. My colleagues did talk about audience – making students aware that they had to shape what they wrote to make it intelligible and persuasive for the putative reader – but the main emphasis was on the development of a writing self, which was seen as closely connected to individual personality and experience.

As the product of an academic writing culture which had no time at all for displays of individual personality, I found this way of thinking quite appealing; but I had difficulty with what struck me as its very individualistic and asocial conception of the writing self. What was missing was the idea that individual voices are necessarily constructed from collective resources, and interpreted or judged according to the norms and standards of a particular discourse community. Though a writer can choose to diverge from the community’s norms and standards, that is only a meaningful choice if s/he is aware of them to begin with. That was the position I had been in when I chose to reject certain conventions; it was not the position most of my students were in. The truth was that we, their teachers, were not equally open to all possible ways of expressing ideas: we wanted them to construct some recognizably ‘academic’ voice. For those who found this difficult, the experience must have been like trying to play a game when no one has told you the rules.

Of course, students did have access to texts which purported to explain the rules of the academic writing game. But one of the insights we get from empirical research of the kind presented in this volume is that the rules experienced practitioners actually follow are more complicated than the precepts laid down in the average composition handbook. Many of the patterns revealed by close analysis of real data are not available to intuition, and are therefore not considered explicitly in most advice for writers. In addition, as contributors to this volume show clearly, ‘academic writing’ is not a single homogeneous category. There is significant structured variation in the patterns which predominate in different academic disciplines, (sub)-genres and cultures.

For teachers who want to demystify the requirements of academic writing for their students, this line of research offers the possibility of an evidence-based approach, in which students would be given a detailed, empirically valid set of specifications for particular types of text: ‘this is how you present yourself in a doctoral thesis on X, Y or $Z '$ ; or ‘these are the steps you follow when writing an abstract/bio/research report’. The teacher who offered that kind of guidance could not be accused of asking students to play a game without telling them what its rules are. But s/he could perhaps be charged with a different kind of mystification: elevating what are actually descriptive generalizations to the status of fixed and non-negotiable rules, and so foreclosing the possibility of any critical reflection upon them.

One compelling piece of evidence that the norms of academic writing are not, in reality, fixed or non-negotiable is the fact that they change over time. One fascinating example is discussed by Françoise SalagerMeyer and her associates (Chapter 15), who relate the developments they identify in the genre of medical book reviews to larger ideological shifts in the culture and discourse of science. Another example takes us back to the question of the first person singular pronoun. Though impersonality still rules in the ‘hard’ sciences, elsewhere in the academy the authorial $I$ has become progressively more acceptable and more common. This, however, almost certainly has nothing to do with the political and epistemological arguments that influenced my own preference for it in the 1980s. Rather it is part of a much more general trend, noted by numerous commentators on present-day English, towards greater informality in many or most varieties of discourse. The underlying reasons for such historical shifts are complex, but it is clear that they are fundamentally social and indeed political. The ‘informalization’ of language, for instance, is neither an isolated nor an ideologically neutral development: it goes along with a more general shift in the values of late modern societies. In our attitudes to everything from what we wear to how we raise our children, we are less hierarchical than we used to be and more egalitarian, less distant and more intimate, less decorous and more spontaneous. In the case of language it can be argued that this trend has been amplified by the influence of new media and communication technologies which lend themselves to spontaneous utterance, and which either actually create, or give the impression of creating, a close and equal relationship between interlocutors.

In the final analysis, though, what is identifiable as a general trend when we look at statistical patterns in large samples (e.g. increasing frequencies of first person singular reference over time, and correspondingly decreasing frequencies of more formal/impersonal alternatives like one and we) is only the aggregated result of the choices made by individual language users; and where the choice has a social meaning, it is itself a form of stance-taking by the writer. The competing variants signify, and are liable to be interpreted as signifying, contrasting ideological positions on a currently contested social issue. An example which makes this very obvious, because it has been the object of a great deal of discussion and conscious reflection, concerns the decision that now has to be made by writers in English on whether to refer to gender-unspecified human antecedents (e.g. ‘the teacher’) using the traditional generic he, a non-sexist alternative (e.g. s/he or singular they) or an avoidance strategy such as pluralizing the sentence. Ideologically, these options will tend to signify, respectively, what might crudely be glossed as a conservative or traditionalist stance, a pro-feminist/gender egalitarian stance and a fence-sitting stance. In such cases like this where there is a meaningful choice, is it right to tell students which option to treat as ‘the norm’ – even if that is done not on the basis of a purely subjective judgement, but on the basis of statistical evidence about which variant is most frequently used in practice? My own answer to that question would be $' _ { \mathrm { { n o } ^ { \prime } } }$ . Our business should be rather to clarify what the options are, encourage reflection on what they mean, and support students in making their own informed decisions.

Here it might be asked: what is wrong with giving students a straight answer to a straight question? Is it not legitimate for them to want to know what the majority of successful writers do, and then use that as a template for their own writing? Certainly, my experience has been that most students appear very anxious to conform to whatever is defined as ‘correct’ usage, which they believe will help them to achieve such instrumental goals as gaining high marks, or writing a thesis that will satisfy the examiners. But if you probe a little, it will often become apparent that their goals as writers are not purely instrumental. Other desires are associated with the act of writing, and indeed with languageusing in general – one of them being the writer’s desire to assert her/his identity, which is also to say, her/his difference or distinctiveness. As several contributors to this volume point out, that desire may ultimately be based on an illusion, inasmuch as the identities constructed in writing are not ‘authentic’ representations of the writer’s essential self. Writers are engaged in a continuous process of self-fashioning, using language to perform identities that will change to meet the demands of different contexts, genres and audiences. In itself, I find that point uncontroversial: but it does not follow that writers have no stake in the kinds of identities they perform, or that they cannot legitimately prefer some to others.

One issue that arises in this connection relates to the construction of voice in a second or additional language. It is particularly salient when the language in question is English, which now functions as a privileged medium for global academic and scientific exchange. In the conclusion to her chapter dealing with national/cross-cultural differences (Chapter 14), Kjersti Fløttum poses the question: ‘how much cultural variation there can be in our world of increasing internationalization?’ (p. 228). The main focus of her discussion is the increasing tendency for academic writing in languages other than English to be shaped by AngloAmerican discourse norms; she quotes (though without fully endorsing) Mauranen et al.’s evaluation of this trend as ‘a threat for local identities and scholarly traditions’. That is a large and important question whose ramifications merit more detailed consideration than I have space for here. But the widespread use of English for academic purposes by writers for whom it is not a first language also raises questions about the way they as individuals use writing to perform identity.

As a student of sociolinguistics, I was taught by a non-native speaker who cheerfully proclaimed (in heavily accented English) that ‘it is part of the meaning of a foreigner to sound like a foreigner’. But what about writing? Is it part of the meaning of a foreigner to read like a foreigner on the page? Is a ‘foreign’ voice acceptable in academic discourse? Discussions of this question are often framed within a discourse which essentially questions the utility, legitimacy or fairness of imposing native norms on non-native users of English. It is pointed out that English has far more second- than first-language users, and that it is often used in contexts where native speakers are either absent or very much in the minority (a point that would undoubtedly hold for some academic/scientific exchanges). In those contexts it is at best irrelevant, and at worst counterproductive (an obstacle to communication), to insist that participants must approximate the native norm. Some of the experts who advance this argument also champion an alternative norm – ‘English as a lingua franca’ or ‘ELF’ – which is designed, on the basis of empirical studies of actual L2 interaction in English, to maximize intelligibility and minimize demands which serve no useful communicative purpose. Though a lot of this discussion concerns phonology, and as such is more about speech than writing, the general point is also applicable to writing. Many common written non-nativisms (like the omission or overinsertion of the definite article) do not obscure the writer’s meaning. They do, however, tend to identify the writer as a non-native – in other words they function as markers of cultural difference. This is a matter on which L2 writers themselves seem to have differing views.

I will leave aside here the position of those second-language writers who are not highly proficient, and who in most cases are not concerned with issues of identity and individual voice: their more modest aim is simply to write intelligibly and without obvious errors. The case that interests me here is that of the highly proficient L2 writer who does not want to pass for native (though s/he might be able to do so, and certainly could with a small amount of editing) for reasons that are connected to her/his sense of the identity s/he wishes to perform. In my experience, this kind of highly proficient writer is less common than the kind who does want to pass, who takes the ability to pass as a benchmark of achievement, and who is often insulted by any suggestion that this is an unnecessary or unfair demand. But I have worked with a small number of exceptionally gifted students whose attitude was different. Their voices in English were individually distinctive, marked by what I recognized as the same personalities they displayed in face-to-face social interaction. They were also marked, however, by the retention in English of certain features which reflected the characteristic structures of their first languages. These tended to be unidiomatic rather than ungrammatical, but nevertheless I pointed them out as potential targets for editing. The students’ response was that they wrote as they did for a reason. Rather than wishing to pass for natives, they wanted to sound like the same person whichever language they wrote in. By ‘the same person’ they meant both ‘myself as a person from a particular, non-British culture’ and ‘myself as a particular individual’. I found this attractive, contributing to, rather than detracting from, the pleasure I derived from reading their work; but it sometimes transpired that colleagues who were responsible for assessing their progress felt differently, complaining about the intrusion of ‘foreignisms’ which they thought should have been ruthlessly excised. Was I putting these students at a disadvantage by allowing them to perform identities which might lead assessors to make negative judgements? Again, I think it was not my choice to make: my responsibility was to draw their attention to the issue, and let them decide what to do about it.

Whenever I write about writing, I find I am pulled in two directions. On one hand I am a sociolinguist, and so very aware of, and deeply interested in, the way all kinds of written discourse are shaped by large-scale social and historical developments, by specific institutional practices (including though not only pedagogic ones) and by prevailing cultural beliefs and values. ‘The writer’ cannot be abstracted from this wider context: the patterns revealed in this volume on stance and voice show that even these apparently most ‘personal’ aspects of writing are not, in the end, matters of purely individual choice. Yet on the other hand I am myself a writer, by which I mean not just someone who writes, but someone to whose life and identity the activity of writing is central. And as a writer, I believe that I have choices. These may not be unlimited or completely free, but nor are they so tightly constrained as to be totally trivial. On the contrary, in fact, I feel freer and more powerful when I write than I do in almost any other context. My inner sociolinguist says that feeling is an illusion; my inner writer replies, ‘fine, but if so it’s a life-enhancing one’.

As a teacher, I realize that I will not succeed in making writing a lifeenhancing experience for every student. (I am well aware that it is not a life-enhancing experience for all my academic colleagues.) But I do think it is possible to demystify what so many students regard as a daunting task by focusing on the interplay of constraint and choice – not denying the importance of either, but inviting students to reflect critically on both. It is idle to suppose that any academic writer can ignore or transcend externally imposed constraints and expectations; but there is still space for writers to negotiate their own positions, and to be shapers as well as reproducers of the discourse they inherit.
