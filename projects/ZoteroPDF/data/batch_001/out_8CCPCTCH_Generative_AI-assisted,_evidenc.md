Purposeful and strategic use of L1 can help with L2 learning. However, in many contexts, monolingual immersion approaches dominate, leading language teachers to refrain from using L1. It can also mean that teachers are not professionally prepared to implement evidence-informed uses of L1. In this article, we share the fndings of an intervention study that aimed to raise preservice English language teachers’ awareness of purposeful L1 use while co-exploring ways generative artifcial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g. ChatGPT) can aid teachers’ knowledge development and strategic utilization of L1 in L2 classrooms. Data were collected from ffty-six preservice language teachers in Hong Kong through a pre- and post-intervention mixed-method survey and follow-up group interviews. The fndings show that explicit instruction on the use of L1 in L2 classrooms can increase preservice teachers’ intention to use L1 as well as their knowledge about the evidence-informed use of L1 and the ways in which generative AI tools can assist their implementation of L1.

Key words: generative AI tools, L1 in L2 classrooms, evidence-informed use of L1, ChatGPT

It is well known that using a learner’s frst language (L1), when done purposefully and strategically, can support their second/foreign language (L2) learning (Harbord 1992; Shin et al. 2020). Studies have shown that when L1 is used to support L2 teaching, learners can learn vocabulary more efectively (Zhao and Macaro 2016) and grasp grammar concepts faster. This can result in an increased speed of L2 processing online and improved L2 accuracy ofine (McManus and Marsden 2017). Evidence-informed practices include using L1 as scafolding, raising interest, making crosslanguage comparisons, and recasting and extending student contributions (see Kerr (2014) for more details).

However, in many contexts, deep-rooted monolingual immersion approaches, e.g. ‘English only’, still dominate (Lin 2015), with the consequence that teachers may refrain from using their L1, feel guilty or unprofessional when they use it, or use it deceptively. It can also mean that teachers are not professionally prepared with the knowledge or practices that can lead to evidence-informed use of L1 (Cummins 2007). L1 use in L2 lessons is not commonly part of initial teacher education or in-service professional development (Kerr 2014). Another obvious challenge is that teachers may not share the same L1 with their learners or know their L1 systems well enough (Huang 2010).

The public release of ChatGPT (a generative AI-powered conversational AI based on a large language model) in November 2022 and the rapid release of other generative AI (GenAI) tools since then has led to excitement about how these tools may be utilized in language teaching and learning (Moorhouse 2024). Although these tools are complex and multifunctional, we defne GenAI tools as tools that leverage deep learning models to generate human-like content, including audio, code, images, texts, and videos. These tools can complete many tasks and create new and unexpected outputs in response to prompts and interactions (Ali et al. 2024). Scholars and language experts have suggested that GenAI tools may aid teachers’ professional knowledge development and evidence-informed practices (Moorhouse 2024) and support students’ self-directed language learning (Meniado 2023). However, scholars have also raised ethical and social concerns about the use of GenAI tools. For example, GenAI tools can generate inaccurate and biased content (Ali et al. 2024). This has led some language teachers to be apprehensive about the use of GenAI tools. Therefore, along with the pedagogic afordances of GenAI tools, teachers and learners must also be made aware of their limitations so they can make an informed decision about whether to use them for teaching and learning purposes (Moorhouse 2024).

In this article, we share the fndings of an intervention study that aimed to raise preservice English language teachers’ awareness of purposeful and evidence-informed use of L1 in L2 teaching while co-exploring the potential GenAI tools can have in aiding teachers in their development of the knowledge and skills needed to utilize L1 in L2 classrooms. The following research questions (RQs) guided the study:

1. How does explicit instruction afect preservice English language teachers’ beliefs about the evidence-informed use of L1 in L2 language classrooms and their intention to use L1 in L2 in their future English language teaching?   
2. How can GenAI tools assist preservice English language teachers in using L1 in their future English language teaching?

The article provides valuable insights that could support language teacher educators in integrating explicit instruction on the use of L1 in L2 language classrooms. It also provides ways GenAI tools can assist preservice English language teachers in using L1 in L2 in their future language teaching.

The intervention study was conducted in one course of a one-year full-time Master of Education in English Language Teaching (MEd:ELT) programme at a Hong Kong university. As part of the MEd:ELT, students must take a core course, ‘Grammar for Teaching’. This course provides a suitable venue for implementing the intervention—grammar is often a challenging aspect of English language instruction, and there is compelling evidence of the value L1 can have in helping learners learn L2 grammatical concepts (e.g. McManus and Marsden 2017).

To design the intervention, frst, the course instructor (lead author) and teaching assistant (second author), along with a plurilingualism expert (fourth author) explored the existing research and practical literature on the use of L1 in L2 classrooms (e.g. Kerr 2014; Shin et al. 2020). They used this to develop a lecture presenting the use of L1 in L2 classrooms, the core knowledge teachers need to use L1 to support L2 learning efectively, and evidence-based strategies teachers can utilize in their language classrooms. Then, they experimented with a GenAI tool called ‘assistant’ (a Conversational AI built on ChatGPT 3.5 available through poe.com) to explore ways teachers could use the tool to support their use of L1 in L2 instruction. It became apparent that the tool had possible utility in helping teachers use L1 in L2 lessons. They could help teachers research their L1 and those of their learners (see Figure 1 for an example), analyse similarities and diferences between learners’ L1s and L2 (Figure 2), and develop cross-language comparison activities (Figure 3). They then added some exploratory activities to allow the students to explore ways GenAI tools could support their future teaching (see Table 1 for examples of the

does chinese have the passive form?

Yes, Chinese does have a passive form.However, the passive voice is not used as frequently in Chinese as it is in some other languages, such as English.In Chinese,the passive voice is often used to emphasize the action or the result of the action rather than the doer of the action.

To form the passive voice in Chinese, the verb is usually preceded by the auxiliary verb"" bei or  gei) which indicate the passive voice. is more commonly used while is often used when the action is done for someone's benefit.

Here's an example to illustrate the formation of the passive voice in Chinese:

Active Voice7Wo xie le zhe pian wenzhang-I wrote this article. Passive Voice:7(Zhe pian wenzhang bei wo xie le-This article was written by me (lit.'This article was written by me).

In the passive voice sentence, the subject of the active voice sentence -) becomes the agent of the passive voice sentence, and the object of the active voice sentence -this article) becomes the subject of the passive voice sentence.The auxiliary verb indicates the passive voice.

It's important to note that while the passive voice exists in Chinese, it is not used as extensively as in English.Chinese often prefers other sentence structures or strategies to convey similar meanings.

How are simple past tense represented in English and Chinese.Please use example sentences to illustrate your points

8Assistant Poe

In Englishthe simple past tense is typically formed by adding the suffix -ed"to the base form of regular verbs.However, irregular verbs have their own unique past tense forms. Here are some examples:

Regular verb (walk):

Present tense: I walk to school every day.   
Simple past tense: Yesterday, I walked to school.

Irregular verb (go):

Present tense: I go to the park on weekends.   
Simple past tense: Last week, I went to the park.

In Chinese,the simple past tense is often expressed by using specific time indicators or context rather than altering the verb form.Here are some examples in Mandarin Chinese:

Verbqu-go

Present tense:Wo xianzai qu xuexiao.-I am going to school now. Simple past tense:7Zuotian wo qu xuexiao le.-Iwent to school yesterday.

Verb chi-eat

Present tense:Wo meitian chi zaofan.-leat breakfast every day Simple past tense:7Wo zuotian chi le zaofan.-Iate breakfast yesterday.

As you can see,while English generally modifies the verb form to indicate the simple past tense,Chinese often relies on time indicators or context to convey the past tense.

exploratory activities and suggested initial prompts students used during the intervention). The university provided a customized GenAI tool built on ChatGPT, which could be used in teaching and learning activities. This version of ChatGPT was used in the intervention. The session involved a thirty-minute prerecorded lecture with activities and a two-hour in-person tutorial. It was conducted in November 2023. The session content is summarized in Table 2. We recognized that the feld of AI is developing rapidly. The GenAI tools and features introduced in this intervention may difer from those available for the preservice teachers in their future practices. However, we believed that by raising preservice teachers’ awareness of the possible utility of GenAI in relation to L1 use, they will be better positioned to draw on GenAI or future technologies to support them in using L1 in the L2 classrooms.

In total, eighty-seven students were enrolled in the two sessions of the course. All the students were invited to participate in the study. Ethical approval was provided by the Research Ethics Committee at Hong Kong Baptist University. All participants were informed in writing of the project’s

aims, and their active consent was sought. Participants were informed that their participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time without negative consequences. In total, ffty-six students agreed to participate and completed the pre-and post-intervention surveys. Of these, eleven participated in follow-up group interviews.

The study involved two data collection tools: a pre- and post-intervention survey and follow-up interviews. The survey was purposefully developed for the study. It included a mix of open and closed items designed to gather the students’ perceptions on the use of L1 in L2 lessons and measure the efect of the intervention on their perceptions and ways they feel GenAI tools could assist them in using L1 in their future English language teaching (see Appendix 1 for the pre-and post-intervention items). The pre-intervention survey was distributed electronically one week before the intervention, and the post-intervention survey was distributed directly after the intervention.

Three follow-up interviews were arranged one to two weeks after the intervention. An interview guide was designed for the study to provide a greater understanding of the participants’ perceptions regarding the use of L1 in L2 lessons, their intention to use L1 in L2 lessons, and their thoughts about the use of GenAI in assisting their professional practices. The group interviews involved three or four students and lasted for about forty to sixty minutes. They were audio-recorded for transcription purposes.

The quantitative survey items were analysed using SPSS 28 to evaluate the impact of the intervention on their level of agreement and intention to use L1 in L2 classrooms. The level of agreement was measured using a fveitem Likert scale, and intention was quantifed on a three-item Likert scale. Descriptive statistics, including mean (M), standard deviation (SD) and degree of freedom (df), were calculated to summarize the data at both preand post-intervention stages. A paired-sample t-test was used to measure the mean diferences between the results to see if there are signifcant diferences. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered signifcant. Responses to item 5 (pre) and 3 (post) involved selecting ‘yes’, ‘maybe’, or ‘no’ regarding participants’ intention of using L1 in future L2 teaching. Thus, frequency counts and percentage distribution were also used to provide a clear and straightforward illustration of participants’ tendencies.

The qualitative survey data and interview data were analysed inductively with reference to the thematic analysis approach proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006). The dataset was treated as a unifed source, and themes were identifed across multiple responses. The researchers frst read and reread the survey responses and transcribed interviews thoroughly to become familiar with the data. Initial codes were generated, followed by thematic grouping, and then systematically compared and further refned. This coding process occurred iteratively until major themes emerged. These themes were reviewed against the RQs before fnalization. The frequencies at which those themes occurred were counted. The rigour and trustworthiness of the analysis and the data were enhanced through double coding.

# Findings

The efect of explicit instruction on the beliefs and intention to use L1 in L2 classrooms

There was a noticeable increase in the level of agreement among participants pertaining to the use of L1 in L2 classrooms following the intervention (Table 3). According to the paired-sample $t$ -test, there is a signifcant diference between the mean score of agreement and intention on using L1 in L2 classrooms before and after the intervention $( P < . 0 5 )$ . Regarding their intention of using L1 in future teaching practices, the proportion of students who responded ‘no’ decreased from 10.71 percent before the intervention to $5 { \cdot } 3 6$ percent after the intervention. The ‘maybe’ category also saw a dramatic reduction from a majority of 71.43 percent pre-intervention to 27.68 percent post-intervention. Remarkably, the ‘yes’ responses experienced a substantial increase from 17.86 percent to 67.86 percent.

The codes of the qualitative survey data observed several changes in students’ perceptions and beliefs associated with using L1 in L2 classes. The most salient themes identifed in the pre-intervention and postintervention surveys are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Together with the quantitative analysis of the survey response, the qualitative results suggested that the explicit instruction had two major efects, which are explained in detail below.

Enhanced awareness of the benefts of L1 use in L2 classrooms

One of the most signifcant contrasts between the pre-intervention and post-intervention is that of students’ understanding of the impacts of L1 in L2 classrooms. Before the intervention, there was a frequent mention $( n = 8 )$ of the negative impacts of using L1 and its role as a barrier to learning L2. Many participants cited reasons such as limited exposure to L2 input, the risk of relying too heavily on L1, and the importance of providing students with more opportunities to practice L2.

Although concerns regarding the inclusion of L1 in L2 classes persisted $( n = 6 )$ ) after the intervention, there was a notable increase in both the frequency of occurrence (from $n = 1 8$ to $n = 2 7$ ) and the diversity of advantages associated with its incorporation in L2 classes compared with the pre-intervention. For example, in addition to lowering the difculty of the target grammar and knowledge items, which participants had mentioned in the pre-intervention, L1 was also associated with other benefts such as delivering clearer instructions, creating resonance, and facilitating students’ mastery of defnitions and metalanguage. Terms not present in the pre-intervention survey, such as ‘good mediator’, ‘helpful tool’, and ‘an assistance’, were used to describe the role of L1 in L2 classrooms in the survey after the intervention. The emergence of these comments suggested that the intervention has not only broadened participants’ understanding of the use of L1 but also helped them reconceptualize the role of L1 in L2 classrooms.

\* Themes that did not appear in the pre-intervention survey.

Professional decision-making and strategic use

Before the intervention, there was a notable frequency of mentions regarding the avoidance of using L1 while prioritizing L2 $( n = 1 3 )$ ). However, none of these mentions were accompanied by any pedagogic reasons. In addition, teachers’ use of L1 in L2 classes was perceived as ‘unprofessional’ and ‘improper’ $( n = 6 )$ . At the same time, considerable numbers of responses demonstrated receptiveness to and expressed the need for the inclusion of L1 when teaching younger and less profcient learners $( n = 9 )$ .

In the post-intervention phase, themes related to the avoidance of L1 and perceptions of unprofessionalism were no longer present. Participants who opposed the use of L1 in L2 classrooms justifed their decision by emphasizing the importance of language input and the creation of an English-speaking environment. Although there were similar frequencies of responses related to the consideration of the medium of instruction use as in the pre-intervention phase $( n = 1 3 )$ , a wider range of contexts was mentioned. In addition to considering the age and profciency of the learners, participants also took into account the class atmosphere, common norms within the institutional context, and the nature and difculty of the teaching content. Furthermore, two newly emerged themes in the post-intervention responses exemplifed participants’ recognition of the challenges associated with the exclusive use of L2 and the positive impact that L1 could have on students’ emotions and their engagement in class. Together, the results not only indicated a shift towards a more positive perception of L1 use among participants, but also demonstrated that the professional rationale guiding participants’ decision-making regarding the use of L1 has expanded. This change in beliefs and understanding of L1 use might suggest why there was a dramatic reduction in the number of participants who were uncertain about whether they would apply L1 in their own teaching. In addition, the fndings suggested that participants might have come to realize that professionalism is not determined solely by the language of teaching, but by whether they can use L1 judiciously for the appropriate purpose and in the right context, while considering the needs and learning requirements of the students.

Generative AI-assisted use of L1 in L2 classrooms

During the intervention, the instructor and students co-explored ways in which GenAI tools could assist teachers in using their L1 in L2 classrooms (Table 1). In the survey and follow-up interviews, the participants were asked to suggest ways in which GenAI may assist them in using L1 purposefully and strategically. Coding revealed three types of assistance: (1) provide knowledge about L1 and L2 language systems $( n = 7 )$ ; (2) develop teaching materials and activities $( n = 1 5 )$ ; (3) act as a personalized assistant for students $( n = 2 4 )$ . Below, each type of assistance is presented.

Provide   
knowledge   
about L1 and L2   
language systems

The participants’ responses suggested that they felt GenAI tools could increase their ‘professional knowledge’, ‘address their L1 shortcomings’, and develop their awareness of the ‘similarities and diferences’ between Chinese and English. For example, one interviewee mentioned how he cannot think of many examples that can illustrate the diferences and similarities between Chinese and English language systems. He suggested that tools such as ChatGPT could help him:

Just in terms of the comparisons between the two languages, how are they diferent? [AI tools] can be more aware of that. One thing about

ChatGPT is that while I need help to think of many examples of the diferences between English and Chinese, ChatGPT can give me many examples.

As a reference tool, GenAI tools can help teachers notice diferences and similarities between languages, identifying possible points of confusion or complexity students may have in their L2 learning, and, therefore, assisting teachers in their lesson preparation and planning.

Development of teaching materials and activities

The participants recognized GenAI’s potential in helping them develop cross-language comparison materials and activities. Participants mentioned that GenAI tools could create ‘some cross-language comparison activities to give students a deeper understanding of two languages’. These include ‘minimal pairs’, ‘false friends’, and ‘translation’ activities. One survey respondent mentioned the example of synonyms. She stated:

We can compare and learn using two languages. For example, when teaching students to distinguish between synonyms, we can use AI to organize these synonyms into both Chinese and English versions. Students might not be sensitive to English synonyms, but they are very familiar with the Chinese ones, which can help them understand.

In addition, two participants mentioned that GenAI tools could help them create cross-language instructions to aid learners in comprehending task requirements. The exploration suggests that the ease and speed at which GenAI tools can generate materials, activity ideas, and examples mean that cross-language comparison activities that may have been time-consuming and challenging to produce without these tools are now easier and more efcient. Teachers could instead evaluate, select, and modify the content generated by GenAI rather than create it from scratch.

Act as a personalized assistant

The participants suggested that GenAI tools can help students use their L1 in L2 learning by acting as a personalized assistant. Participants mentioned that students could interact with GenAI tools in their L1 and ask questions about their L2 lesson content that they do not understand and want to clarify; they can input their L2 written work into GenAI tools and get feedback on them in their L1, and they can ‘ask AI to explain what they do not know about some technical items of English language and ask it to raise some examples and give an explanation’. Two participants mentioned that students could ask GenAI tools to create exercises and activities suitable to their needs for self-study and consolidation. Many participants $( n = 1 2 )$ ) mentioned that students could use GenAI tools to help them translate words and content from their L1 to L2 and vice versa. This can increase their understanding of the L2 content.

Interestingly, two survey respondents provided cautious responses to how GenAI could support students’ L2 learning. One teacher mentioned that she would ‘provide students with some helpful AI tools and tell them how to get help from AI but not to be too dependent on AI’. Another teacher mentioned that she did not ‘want students to get in touch with AI too early’; and that ‘it’s difcult to selectively use AI if [students] have not mastered how to use AI carefully’. These responses suggest that the teachers felt responsible for overseeing students’ GenAI tools use and

wished to guide them to become responsible and strategic users of the tools. This could include informing students that GenAI tools can generate inaccurate and biased information.

We were encouraged to see that explicit instruction positively afected the intentions of preservice English language teachers to use L1 in their future English language teaching. There was a signifcant change in their afrmation to use L1 in their L2 lessons, with the teachers showing a greater awareness of the purposeful and strategic use of L1 in their responses in the post-intervention survey and interviews. These fndings suggest that even a short intervention can provide increased clarity to teachers on the benefts of using L1 and provide them with evidence-based approaches. In many contexts, the use of L1 can mistakenly be seen as a sign of unprofessionalism and evidence of a lack of L2 profciency in the teachers (Lin 2015), and indeed, this came through in our pre-intervention survey responses as well. However, the post-intervention survey responses suggested a shift in this belief. By integrating the topic of evidence-based use into an MEd programme, the belief that using L1 is unprofessional may be dispelled. Instead, teachers gained a more nuanced concept of L1 use—one in which the context of use and purpose of use are essential considerations.

The release of GenAI tools has provided teachers with an additional resource to support their professional practices (Meniado 2023; Moorhouse 2024). Given how recently these tools have emerged, empirical research has yet to suggest ways they can be integrated into teachers’ professional practices (Chiu 2023). However, through our co-exploration with preservice teachers, we found several ways these tools could assist teachers in using L1 in L2 lessons. First, GenAI tools could act as a resource for teachers to develop their own knowledge about the learners’ L1 and any similarities and diferences between the L1 and L2. This information could help teachers decide what content to prioritize and help them predict possible learner challenges (Huang 2010). This could be particularly useful in multilingual classrooms where teachers and learners may not share a common language. Second, the study suggests that GenAI tools can be used to develop cross-language comparison activities. Given the limited availability of such materials (Kerr 2014), being able to generate them quickly and efciently could encourage teachers to utilize them more frequently in their teaching. Third, GenAI tools can be a useful resource in helping language learners utilize their L1 in their L2 learning. These tools can act as a personalized assistant through which students can ask questions and interact with the tools in their L1 about their L2 content (Hwang and Chen 2023). This use could potentially support self-directed language learning (Meniado 2023). Importantly, given the reliability and ethical issues raised about GenAI (Ali et al. 2024), teachers must be aware that these tools can generate inaccurate and biased information and educate their students about these risks. Teachers can explicitly declare and acknowledge that GenAI tools have been used when creating or translating materials (especially if they do not share an L1 with students or parents) to increase transparency. Learners and their parents could be encouraged to inform teachers if they notice any issues with the content created with GenAI assistance.

To make GenAI-assisted, evidence-informed use of L1 in the L2 classroom possible, language teachers must have professional GenAI competence (Moorhouse 2024). Specifcally, they need to be able to efectively prompt and interact with these tools to get their desired results. In addition, they need to be able to evaluate the responses generated by these tools and recognize their limitations. For example, in Figure 3, Chinese language readers may notice that for the Chinese translations of the past-tense sentences, ChatGPT added the particle ‘le’ (written as ‘了’), which also indicates the perfective aspect, not just the simple past. ChatGPT might not have captured these grammatical intricacies. This suggests that while useful, GenAI tools may generate examples that might still be lacking in grammatical delicacy. Teachers are encouraged to explore diferent models, versions, features, and settings of GenAI tools (e.g. Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) to see which ones provide the most relevant and useful responses (Moorhouse 2024). Using these tools with other methods, such as reference books, may be necessary. Teachers should also inform students that GenAI tools may generate incorrect content (e.g. incorrect synonyms or false language comparisons). Students can be reminded to verify the information they receive from GenAI tools using thesauruses, collocation dictionaries, and reference books. Despite these limitations, we believe that when used critically, GenAI tools can assist language teachers in using L1 in their L2 classrooms and thereby support students’ L2 learning.

The study has shown that through explicit instruction, the beliefs of preservice English language teachers about using L1 in L2 language classrooms and their intention to use L1 in the L2 classroom in their future English language teaching can be changed. In addition, co-exploration allowed us to identify various ways GenAI tools can assist teachers in utilizing L1. Given that two barriers to the use of L1 are mindset and access to suitable resources (Kerr 2014; Lin 2015), we believe that the integration of GenAI-assisted, evidence-informed use of L1 in the L2 classroom into teacher education and development could lead to more purposeful and strategic use of L1 in L2 lessons. We hope further studies can verify this claim. Finally, it is essential to note that most of the participants in this study will likely teach students with whom they share the same frst language (Mandarin Chinese). Further studies should be conducted in multilingual contexts where teachers may be unfamiliar with their students’ L1s.
