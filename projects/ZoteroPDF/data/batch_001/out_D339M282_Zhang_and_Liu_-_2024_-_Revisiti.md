# ABSTRACT

# KEYWORDS

Informal digital learning of English (IDLE) is an increasingly important subfield of inquiry in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) for its concentration on the language learning practices of the digital native EFL students in out-of-class contexts. Attention in mainstream research of IDLE has been directed to (meta)cognition, learning outcomes, etc. as separate domains of IDLE; however, these significant efforts have neither clarified the blurry boundary between semi-structured IDLE practices and unstructured extramural practices nor investigated factors that positively predict learners’ IDLE-enhanced learning outcomes or practices on the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. As such, the present study sets out to extend the discussion of informal digital learning of English (IDLE) by establishing a recontextualized model of IDLE. To this end, a total of 1080 Chinese university EFL learners were invited to complete an IDLE questionnaire survey developed and validated in the context of China. Using IBM SPSS Amos 22, structural equation modeling was run to examine the inter-factorial relationships among six IDLE sub-constructs by examining eight hypotheses. The results confirm that 1) learners’ IDLE-enhanced benefits are positively predicted by support from their important others, resources and cognition, but not learners’ authentic L2 experience and IDLE frequency and devices, and 2) learners’ IDLE practices can be significantly predicted by resources and cognition, authentic L2 experience, and IDLE frequency and devices. Based on these findings, we put forward an expanded conceptual framework of IDLE and suggest more replication studies in the future to testify this study’s generalizability and to arrive at more stable conclusions.

# 1.  Introduction

In the article to revisit issues and trends in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in the new millennium, Garrett (2009) argues that the nature of CALL is “not shorthand for the use of technology” but a dynamic and complex site where technology, pedagogy, and theory are inextricably intertwined, and language learning transpire productively (p. 720). Against this backdrop, scholars have published timely to explore how students’ second/foreign language (L2) learning is promoted by technology, with the springing up of umbrella terms to capture language learning in informal and digitalized settings, including autonomous language learning with technology (Lai, 2017), extramural English (Sundqvist & Sylvén, 2016); CALL in the digital wilds (Sauro & Zourou, 2019), and online informal learning of English (Toffoli & Sockett, 2015). Of these conceptual efforts, informal digital learning of English (IDLE) is an increasingly important subfield of inquiry in CALL for its concentration on the language learning practices of the digital native students in out-of-class contexts (Lee, 2021). Benson’s (2011) four-dimension framework of L2 learning beyond the classroom tenders a contextualized outline to IDLE researchers and practitioners (Soyoof et  al., 2021). Drawing on this framework, thus, Lee (2019c) illuminates IDLE in terms of its formality, location, pedagogy, as well as the locus of control, conceptualizing IDLE as autonomous English learning practices in out-ofclass digitalized settings without much mediation from formal instruction (Table 1).

To further differentiate IDLE from other similar notions, Lee (2019c) adds that IDLE can occur within two contexts: the extracurricular and the extramural. The former highlights the “self-directed, self-instructed, digital learning of English in semi-structured, out-of-class environments that are linked to formal education”, with the example of watching TED talks in preparation for formal tasks (Lee, 2019c, p. 115). It is worthy of note that, as shown in Table 1, extracurricular IDLE differs from non-formal digital learning of English, which is other-directed and can be exemplified in the case of flipped classrooms. Regarding the extramural IDLE, it is understood as “self-directed, naturalistic, digital learning of English in unstructured, out-of-class environments, independent of a formal language program” (Lee, 2019c, p. 116). One example is that an EFL (English as a foreign language) learner engages with native English speakers on social media or gaming platforms for recreational purposes. Most IDLE-related studies take the latter stance and posit that IDLE is the same as the extramural IDLE activities (See Lee, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c; Lee & Drajati, 2019; Lee & Dressman, 2018). This notion of extramural IDLE also receives support from other studies that examine the relationship between engaging students with the informal digitalized learning environment and L2 outcomes in terms of its limited (Burston, 2015; Sung et  al., 2015) and positive effects on writing (Sun et  al., 2017), vocabulary (Jensen, 2017), and testing (Lai et  al., 2015).

However, this begs the question of how to define the ever-changing boundary between semi-structured extracurricular IDLE practices and unstructured extramural practices, especially in terms of how to treat the dynamic between the two types of IDLE activities. For instance, an EFL learner is encouraged by the teacher to watch TED talks on YouTube after class to prepare for his or her group assignments, but the student is drawn to comment on these TED videos and may thus interact with other English learners from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. In this case, is the student engaging in extracurricular or extramural IDLE practices? There seems to be a conceptual paradox that taking in learners’ extracurricular practices may risk romanticizing their agency in IDLE, but it will jeopardize our holistic understanding of learners’ IDLE if excluding the extracurricular part which still has the potential to be a source of their fully autonomous and naturalistic online English learning. There is an imperative to adopt a more comprehensive and rigorous take on the ways in which learners engage in IDLE activities. As such, this study aims to reconceptualize the notion of IDLE by introducing a new conceptual model based on a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis through a large-sample questionnaire survey among Chinese university EFL learners.

# 2.  Study purpose and hypotheses

# 2.1.  An expanded understanding of IDLE

Given previous studies have revealed the significant role of others’ support (e.g. teachers, peers) in developing EFL learners’ sense of agency and rendering them autonomous in out-of-class and digital settings (He et  al., 2021; He & Zhu, 2017; Lai et  al., 2018; Lai & Gu, 2011; Liu, 2022), we still base ourselves in Benson’s (2011) framework and reconceptualize IDLE as self-directed, autonomous English learning practices in out-of-class and digital environments where they are motivated by personal interests or with the facilitation of others. The location of IDLE can be a fluid dimension but is still deeply rooted in the informal and digital settings. In this respect, language learning is not a process in pursuit of certification but takes place in an unstructured and naturalistic way. Regarding the locus of control, students engaging in IDLE are able to direct their learning and exercise learner autonomy to navigate the digital world with versatility and productivity. Also noteworthy is that IDLE is not only elicited by personal interest but also the support from others (e.g. teacher, peers). We thus argue that IDLE can result from self-initiation or other initiation. With this updated conceptualization, we seek to rule out the section strictly attached to formal education contexts in the extracurricular IDLE (e.g. using technology for finishing homework), and retain those extracurricular IDLE components that are teacher-initiated or -facilitated but still allow students to make voluntary decisions (e.g. asking students to engage in open-ended out-of-class tasks with technology). In so doing, we may benefit from an expanded understanding of learners’ IDLE and how the internet opens up opportunities for learners to gain autonomy and access a fund of knowledge at their disposal in the digitalized and mobilized world.

IDLE activities can be classified in various ways. By its very nature, as Lee and Dressman (2018) point out, IDLE activities are either form-focused or meaning-focused. The former concentrating on linguistic elements and the accuracy of language learning, the latter attaches much importance to language use in authentic contexts. In a subsequent study of Indonesian EFL learners’ IDLE, Lee and Drajati (2019) find that students often engage in receptive IDLE activities (RIA) and productive IDLE activities (PIA). RIA places emphasis on understanding English content and implies language learners’ identity as content browsers, while PIA focuses on producing English content, suggesting that they are content creators. A body of literature has revealed that engaging with PIA and RIA can bring a series of linguistic and affective benefits to language learners. Specifically, it is found that IDLE can effectively predict language learners’ English grades (Lai et  al., 2015), and leave a positive impact on language learners’ vocabulary development (Lee, 2019b), speaking and listening (Lee, $2 0 1 9 c$ ; Lee & Dressman, 2018). On the affective level, IDLE is assumed to be significantly predictive of language learner enjoyment (Lee, 2019c; Lee & Lee, 2021), confidence (Lee & Dressman, 2018), learning efficacy (Lai et  al., 2015); willingness to communicate (Lee, 2019a; Lee & Drajati, 2019). Of note is that a prerequisite for desirable learning outcomes should be the quality of online L2 engagement beyond the classroom. In the eyes of Lai et  al.

(2015) and Lee (2019b, 2019c), IDLE quality requires not only the diversity of language learners’ L2 practices but the ways in which they are committed to the wider and thus more autonomous language learning ecology. Based on these insights, we firstly propose the variable IDLE practices (IP) and define it as the close engagement with RIA and PIA with a particular focus on the improvement of language skills. Then, all perceived positive linguistic and affective outcomes associated with IDLE practices are combined into IDLE-enhanced benefits (IEB). The following hypothesis is thereby formed:

H1: IDLE practices can be a positive predictor of IDLE-enhanced benefits.

# 2.2.  What constitutes IDLE in the chinese EFL context?

# 2.2.1.  Others and support

As aforementioned, scholars have identified that support from others figures prominently in language learners’ engagement with technology in informal settings (He et  al., 2021; He & Zhu, 2017; Lai et  al., 2018; Lai & Gu, 2011). Bearing this in mind, we put forward the expanded construct of IDLE by encompassing the other-initiated, self-directed, extracurricular IDLE activities and regarding support from others as a force that cannot be neglected in students’ autonomous use of technology for English learning in out-of-class settings. Understanding the role of others’ support in learners’ autonomous use of technology requires us to comprehend learner autonomy which refers to learners’ capacity to take control of their own learning and embodies aspects such as goal setting and planning, strategy development, and outcome evaluation (Holec, 1981). The core of learner autonomy is to self-regulate and capitalize on learning opportunities and the readiness to self-regulate learning in various settings (Benson, 2008; Lai et  al., 2016). Research has demonstrated that teachers can exert an impact on students’ autonomy through encouragement for technology use (Lai, 2015), and technology resources recommendations (Lai et  al., 2015). Specifically, the assignments or recommendations that teachers leave to students largely influence students’ technology use and the type of IDLE activities that they engage in. In a similar vein, Zhang and Pérez-Paredes (2019) argue that when students are confronted with mobile English learning resources, their choice of IDLE activities is subject to “recommendations from social media and authoritative education experts”(p. 1). These studies seem to confirm that Others and support (OS) can enhance learners’ autonomous participation in online English learning activities outside the classroom. Such participation may be initiated by others but can still contribute to language learners’ positive changes in terms of their learning affections and outcomes. It is argued that even though the locus of control is self-directed, pedagogically, activities resulting from Others and support may not necessarily belong to extracurricular IDLE because teachers may encourage learners to participate in activities such as watching movies to enhance cultural awareness, which may not essentially reflect the instructed-oriented pedagogical tasks and goals. Consequently, the following hypothesis is posited:

Hypothesis 2: Others and support is a positive predictor of IDLE-enhanced benefits.

# 2.2.2.  Authentic L2 experience

Earlier research has highlighted that engaging EFL learners with authentic English-medium communities (e.g. Facebook, YouTube) can improve their positive attitudes toward English use (Yang, 2013), intercultural awareness and intercultural communicative competence (Özdemir, 2017), language confidence and enjoyment (Lee & Drajati, 2019; Lee & Dressman, 2018), communicative skills (Yen et  al., 2015). Further, in an attempt to frame IDLE from research to practice, Lee (2021) pays special attention to EFL learners’ interactions with other English users across the world on social media, arguing that exposure to the target language environment is conducive to the development of language learners’ receptive and expressive skills. Importantly, it should be argued with discretion that Lee’s point can lend itself to the Chinese EFL context in which language learners are believed not to frequently engage in authentic online English environments, such as Google, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, under the influences of the test-based learning ideologies and the accented Chinese English (Fang, 2017). This is concordant with the intranational communicative pattern of EFL speakers in the Expanding Circle made up of countries/regions where English is not frequently spoken and used in daily lives (Kachru, 1985). These may combine to lead to Chinese university EFL learners’ less frequent engagement with international communication. However, what we intend to explore in this study is the extent to which Lee’s (2021) argument for engaging in online, authentic L2 experience is of relevance to the affective and linguistic gains of Chinese university EFL learners in the increasingly digitalized and globalized world where English is widely used as a lingua franca. To this end, we suggest the variable Authentic L2 experience (L2E) and put forward the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 3: Authentic L2 experience is a positive predictor of IDLE practices. Hypothesis 4: Authentic L2 experience is a positive predictor of IDLE-enhanced benefits.

# 2.2.3.  Resources and cognition

Chun (2019) regards the year 2010 as a watershed in CALL and defines the stage from 2010 onwards as ecological CALL, because the constantly evolving digital technologies (e.g. wearable devices, high-speed mobile networks) enable students to learn a language at any time and place, and thus favor a resource-rich learning ecology. This aligns with the study of Zhang and Pérez-Paredes (2019) who adopted a mixed-method research design to examine Chinese postgraduate students’ autonomous use of smartphones for English learning in informal settings. It is reported that accessible vocabulary resources in mobile applications serve as one driving force for their out-of-class mobile-assisted language learning. Also, as Godwin-Jones (2019) notes, the wide and personal choice of learning resources in the online world tends to bring language learners into contact with the digital wilds and motivate them to exert agency to become autonomous learners. With increasing control over their own learning trajectory and goal setting, they are able to engage in informal language learning productively. This is echoed in the path modeling study of He and Zhu (2017). The quantitative results from 235 Chinese university students highlight the dynamic nature of informal digital environments as technology-mediated learning opportunities. In such environments, language learners are able to expand their knowledge and enrich learning experiences based on the ability to customize learning objectives, which is pointed out by He and Zhu (2017) as cognitive and metacognitive aspects of digital informal learning” (p. 17). In this regard, we recognize the significance of the variable Resources and cognition (RC) in IDLE, with resources referring to abundant learning opportunities and materials in digital settings and cognition as the awareness of one’s learning process and the ability to set learning goals accordingly. Therefore, we hypothesize:

Hypothesis 5: Resources and cognition is a positive predictor of IDLE practices.

Hypothesis 6: Resources and cognition is a positive predictor of IDLE-enhanced benefits.

# 2.2.4.  Frequency and devices

Although this area of inquiry is still in its infancy, the quantity of IDLE, namely the amount of time spent on IDLE practices or the frequency of IDLE activities, has gained close attention from CALL scholars who hold ambivalent attitudes towards the impact of IDLE quantity on learning gains. In their meta-analysis studies, Burston (2015) investigated mobile learning in out-of-class environments and found that students’ commitment to such learning beyond the classroom cannot guarantee objectively quantifiable outcomes and progress in language skills.

Similarly, Lee (2019b) conducted a mixed-method study to explore the association between frequent IDLE activities and Korean EFL learners’ L2 vocabulary scores. The finding shows that exposing L2 learners to the digital environment is not necessarily related to L2 vocabulary development. In contrast, other studies have revealed a positive relationship between IDLE quantity and vocabulary acquisition (Lee & Dressman, 2018; Sundqvist & Wikström, 2015). Such IDLE quantity has also been reported to be able to predict successful L2 learning, especially in terms of communicative skills development (Sundqvist, 2009) and standardized test scores (Lai et  al., 2015; Lee, 2019c; Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012). In particular, Lee and Dressman (2018) investigate 94 Korean EFL learners’ IDLE activities. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that students engaging in diverse IDLE practices are more likely to benefit from the technology-rich environment and achieve positive learning outcomes. Later, in a hierarchical linear regression analysis, Lee (2019c) surveyed 71 Korean EFL learners and identified that IDLE quantity and diversity could predict students’ affective change and English learning outcomes.

These contrasting findings are thought-provoking. As Lee (2019c) underlines, it should be concluded with caution that the massive amount of time spent on IDLE practices can bring learners affective learning or L2 outcomes, because the specific digital devices (e.g. Smartphone, iPad, Desktop, Laptop) may vary in terms of its affordances and impacts on learners’ IDLE trajectories. Equally important in interpreting these distinct findings is how language learning outcomes are measured (e.g. through self-perception or test scores) in the previous studies. Also of note is the varied research settings, with some situating their studies within EFL university contexts (Lee, 2019c; Lee & Dressman, 2018) and others concentrating on learners of more diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds (Burston, 2015). These dissimilarities may, in a large measure, account for the incongruent results from prior literature. Against this background, drawing upon the items from Lee (2019c) and Lai and her associates (2015), this study adapts the variable Frequency and devices (FD) from previous literature on IDLE quantity and diversity, and proposes the following two hypotheses:

Hypothesis 7: Frequency and devices is a positive predictor of IDLE practices.

Hypothesis 8: Frequency and devices is a positive predictor of IDLE-enhanced benefits.

To better illustrate the hypothesized relations among different factors of the revisited IDLE in the Chinese university EFL context, the following structural model is generated with the arrows representing positive relations:

# 3.  Methods

This study adopted an SEM approach to investigate Chinese university EFL learners’ engagement with technology for autonomous language learning in informal settings, with a developed and validated questionnaire to tap the components of the expanded model of IDLE. To be specific, we conducted 12 pilot interviews to elicit potential factors in the initial questionnaire in the main study. Then, we followed Kline’s (2015) procedure of undertaking an SEM study, responding to his call for studies to properly carry out the basic six steps, including satisfying all the assumptions of SEM such as multinormality, having enough participants $( \geq 2 0 0 )$ , etc., which have not been rigorously followed in many existing IDLE/CALL research. The first two steps are specification and evaluation of items and sub-constructs, which have been partly elaborated in the literature review section. Thirdly, to construct the measures and conduct instruments-selection, we went through several rigorous steps to develop and validate the questionnaire, which is explained in Section 3.1. Step four estimation requires us to collect the data and screen them, which is embodied in section four where a CFA model was set to assess the data fitness to the model. Step five focuses on respecification and the enhancement of the model fitness. Finally comes the report of the well-fitted structural equation model.

# 3.1.  Instruments and measures

On the ground of previous relevant IDLE literature, we firstly expanded the notion of IDLE and identified its six component factors. What followed was the 12 pilot interviews conducted to elicit some sub-themes associated with these factors based on students’ reports and reflections on their IDLE practices in Chinese university contexts. Subsequently, we combined these sub-themes and relevant IDLE literature to generate initial items $\left( \mathrm { N } = 6 0 \right)$ ) in the newly developed IDLE questionnaire and put forward a structural model to illustrate the hypothesized relations among these factors. After several rounds of expert review, item revision, piloting, reliability estimation and validation, the final pool of items $\left( \mathrm { N } = 3 4 \right)$ was generated.

# 3.1.1.  Pilot interviews

Pilot interviews happened before data collection, serving as an important part of questionnaire development. Twelve undergraduate students enrolled in varying programmes and universities (Female $\ c = 8$ , Male $=$ 4) in mainland China voluntarily participated in online individual semi-structured interviews in October 2021 through convenience sampling. All interviews were conducted via WeChat or Tencent Meeting, in Putonghua due to the shared linguistic and cultural background. Consisting of four aspects (see Appendix A for details), the interview protocol was derived from previous academic insights into language learning with technology beyond the classroom setting (He & Zhu, 2017; Lai et  al., 2015; Lai & Gu, 2011; Lee, 2019c). The protocol could help the researchers to elicit participants’ demographic information, the quantity, diversity, and nature of their IDLE activities, their (meta-) cognitive, affective strategies, and their learning outcome, resources, received support from others. All interview questions were pilot-tested and proofread by two colleagues in this field. Finally, we extracted some well-constructed sub-themes from the qualitative data and then prepared them as tentative questions in the IDLE questionnaire to be validated.

# 3.1.2.  Questionnaire

Based on the interview results and relevant IDLE literature (e.g. Lai et  al., 2015; Lee & Drajati, 2019), a pool of items $\left( \mathrm { N } = 6 0 \right)$ ) was initially generated, constantly checked with existing instruments, and scrutinized for congruency with IDLE literature as discussed in the literature review section for content validity. These items were also piloted among 60 participants with the same demographic background as those in the main study, to enhance the questionnaire reliability and validity (Dörnyei & Taguchi, 2010). The tentative questionnaire was then administrated to undergraduate mainland Chinese students in Chinese via an online survey platform (www.wjx.cn). Later, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were computed to modify and finalize the developed questionnaire. These validation procedures laid the foundation for the testification of the hypothesized structural model of IDLE (Figure 1).

The questionnaire consists of two parts: the participants’ demographic information (25 items) and IDLE (34 items): (1) Others and support (5 items); (2) Authentic L2 experience (3 items); (3) Resources and cognition (4 items); (4) Frequency and devices (5 items); (5) IDLE-enhanced benefits (9 items); and (6) IDLE practices (8 items). The rating scale in the IDLE section is the six-point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1 point) to ‘strongly agree’ (6 points). With this well-developed instrument, it is now theoretically feasible for AMOS (IBM SPSS Amos in full name, a structural equation modeling software that extends standard multivariate analysis methods and is designed to assist researchers in building attitudinal and behavioral models reflecting complex statistical relationships) to derive a unique estimate of every SEM model parameter (Step 2). At the very beginning of the questionnaire (See Appendix B), we highlight that the survey focused on mainland Chinese undergraduate students’ English language learning in informal settings outside of the classroom to avoid the repeated statement of the IDLE nature of this inquiry in each single question, because this would necessitate too many Chinese characters that could render the questionnaire overloaded.

# 3.2.  Participants

In the main study, stratified probability sampling was applied by dividing EFL mainland Chinese undergraduates into subgroups by region (North China $= 2 4 3$ ; South China $= 4 3 5$ ; middle China $= 3 5 4 \AA$ ). Altogether 1080 responses were collected, out of which 48 answers were deleted due to containing more than 2 missing values $\left( \mathrm { N } = 2 1 \right)$ ) and the short duration of completing the questionnaire ( $\ l \leq \ l 0 0$ seconds, manual check for answers between $1 0 1 \sim 1 3 0$ seconds, $\mathrm { N } = 2 7 \ \cdot$ ). Multivariate outliers with extreme scores on two or more variables were also excluded from the data pool in Amos. Finally, 811 valid responses were retained (Table 2).

# 3.3.  Data collection and analysis

Data were gathered through administering an online questionnaire from November 2021 to January 2022. With the help of our social contacts working as English instructors at different Chinese universities, a URL link and e-poster with a QR code were sent to their students who 1)

had out-of-class English learning experiences with technology for the recent six months, and 2) consented to join this study. The teachers first introduced this survey to the expected respondents, and they made it explicit in the debriefing (see Appendix B) that if students were not sure regarding IDLE or the questionnaire requirements, they need to stop and consult their teachers or contact us. They were allowed to continue to complete the questionnaire unless they had no doubts. Also noted is that prior to answering the questionnaire, all respondents were given explicit explanations about the expanded notion of IDLE and were invited to take the survey based on their IDLE experiences instead of what they have experienced in formal instruction.

The data was then processed via IBM SPSS Statistics 24 and IBM SPSS Amos 22 to conduct SEM and test the postulated hypotheses. A twofold approach was adopted to assess the measurement model (item reliability, construct validity, normality of data distribution) and structural model (SEM). Firstly, to measure the reliability of this questionnaire, Cronbach’s alpha coefficients (α) were computed for all scales to testify internal consistency. The overall α for the entire questionnaire was .80, exceeding a minimum threshold of .70, which indicated strong reliability. A scale was regarded as adequate if the α value was higher than .70 (Chin, 1998). To test the construct validity of the questionnaire, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was computed. The original KMO value was .504. Seven items with communalities not exceeding .75 were removed from the analysis and the final KMO value is .786. To sum up, this questionnaire achieved reliability and validity (Table 4). Thirdly, correlations between the variables were then analyzed (Std. Estimate $> ~ 7$ ; $\mathrm { ~ p ~ } = \mathrm { ~ . 0 0 0 } \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \mathrm { ~ } }$ . There existed no extreme multivariate collinearity as $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } < \mathbf { \mathcal { S } } 0$ .

# 3.4.  Effect size

Effect size is the strength of the effect of one variable on others (Larson-Hall & Plonsky, 2015). This study adopts the suggested correlation coefficients (r) as an indicator of effect size in L2-specific benchmarks (Plonsky & Oswald, 2014), or r close to .25, .40, and .60 indicate small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. In addition, noteworthy is the beta $( \beta )$ value of predictor variables which can also help to explain effect sizes (Cohen et  al., 2011), between 0 and .10, .10 and .30, .30 and .50, and $> . 5 0$ as indicative of weak, modest, moderate and strong effect size, respectively.

# 4.  Findings

# 4.1.  Descriptive results

Descriptive analysis was conducted for survey items and the multinormality of the data (Table 3). SEM adopts maximum likelihood as a default estimation method that assumes multivariate normality (Kline, 2015), which should be examined as a necessary step before running SEM. In Table 3, all univariate distributions were not severely non-normal, and the univariate normality of the data based on the cutoff was between |0.0| and|3.0| for skewness and kurtosis, which means that no variable was severely skewed or indicating severe kurtosis. The reason is that as Kline (2015) puts it, ‘variables where the absolute values of skewness $>$ 3.0 are described as severely skewed’ (p. 76). Also, although Kline (2015) did not specify the ideal index of kurtosis, he did caution that a serious kurtosis problem might arise when the absolute value was larger than 10.0.

# 4.2.  EFA

What follows is the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) conducted to enhance the interpretability of established factors in the unrestricted measurement model (Kline, 2015). In addition to multivariate normality, another assumption of computing SEM is that the data matrix submitted to AMOS should be positive definite, which was achieved on the conditions that (a) the matrix was nonsingular because no eigenvalue of subconstruct equals zero, and (b) all eigenvalues of the matrix were positive $( > 0 )$ . We then assessed the suitability of data for factor analysis to determine the factorability of the data, following Pallant’s (2020) advice for SEM sample size requirements (typically no less than 200 participants) and the strength of variable association, which is determined by Bartlett’s test of sphericity and KMO. In the current study, the KMO and Bartlett’s test results indicate that KMO measure was above 0.60 $\mathrm { \ K M O } \ = \ . 7 6 ) $ and Bartlett’s test result was significant $( { \mathfrak { p } } =$ .000), assuming that there were significant factors to be extracted from the current data (Table 4).

EFA was run based on principle components analysis (PCA). Kaiser’s criterion (eigenvalues $\geq ~ 1$ ) was adopted to determine the number of factors to be retained. Altogether six factors were selected and accounted for $6 3 . 7 7 \%$ of the total variance (usually accountability $\geq 6 0 \%$ is good, Kline, 2015), each accounting for $1 9 . 1 8 \%$ , $1 3 . 1 \%$ , $9 . 9 4 \%$ , $8 . 9 7 \%$ , $7 . 0 2 \%$ , and $5 . 5 7 \%$ of the total variance, respectively. Variable communalities were greater than .40 for all the items, ranging from .496 to .775. Overall, the results suggested that EFA was satisfied, and data could be sent for further analysis.

# 4.3.  CFA

A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model was set to validate the restricted measurement items and assess the data fit of the model (Kline, 2015) based on the widely acknowledged fit indices: CMIN/DF indicating $\mathtt { \Delta } \mathtt { X } ^ { 2 }$ divided by the value of degree of freedom (df), CFI (comparative fit index), RMSEA, and NFI. To respecify the model as a step that SEM usually arrives at, two steps were taken to enhance the model fit (Kline, 2015). Modification index (M.I.) values were used to detect items with strong cross loadings on other factors; 18 items with high M.I. values toward other factors were removed. Next, the fixed parameters of covariance between nine pairs of items were set free. Consequently, the goodness-of-fit indices for all scales indicate that the nature of the measurement items in this model fit the collected data well (Table 5).

Table 4. KMO and Bartlett’s test results.

The modified CFA model was examined to evaluate the factor loadings by restricting the paths in the model. The results indicate that all values were greater than ± .50, ranging from .636 to .845 (Table 6), showing strong significance (Hair et  al., 2006).

To establish the reliability and validity of the constructs in the measurement model, internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were examined. Regarding internal consistency, firstly, Cronbach’s α coefficient in this modified measurement model was .80, higher than .70, and thus suggested the initial achievement of internal consistency. Secondly, compositive reliability (CR) can be ensured with the premise that factor convergence is higher than the absolute value of the correlation coefficient among factors (Chin, 1998). It was achieved in this study with all CRs higher than .80 (Table 6). Thirdly, internal consistency, indicator reliability, and the square root of average variance extracted (AVE) were combined to assess convergent validity. Indicator reliability was satisfied since each item of indicator loading is at least .70 on the related construct (Table 6). These proved that all item loadings exceeded the accepted thresholds.

Finally, discriminant validity needs to be ensured to show that all the subconstructs are different from each other and can be evaluated by considering the correlation among the variables, such as the square root of AVE. The factor correlations for the questionnaire were all at acceptable levels between factors (Table 7). Since all the r coefficients were higher than .60, indicating large effect sizes (Plonsky & Oswald, 2014), the results of the measurement model satisfied all the assumptions (see Appendix C for all factor loadings, mean, SD, and CR for all the items in each sub-construct).

# 4.4.  Hypothesis testing

Dependent/outcome variables in SEM are termed endogenous” (from within) variables, whereas independent/cause variables are defined as “exogenous” (from without/the outside) variables (Kline, 2015, p. 119). To examine the eight hypotheses postulated, this section reveals the direct effects of four exogenous variables (Others and support, Authentic L2 experience, Resources and cognition, Frequency and devices) on two endogenous variables (IDLE-enhanced benefits & IDLE practices). The estimated value of the model was evaluated through the overall goodness of model fit assessed by CMIN/DF, GFI, AGFI, CFI, RMSEA, and RMR (Table 8).

A standardized/path coefficient is the statistical estimate of an exogenous variable on an endogenous variable that is represented by $\beta$ (Kline, 2015). Apart from path coefficients (β), CR/T values were assessed to test the eight hypotheses, of which five were accepted while three were rejected (Table 9). Among these accepted hypotheses, H2 had the largest effect size $( \beta )$ at .52, followed by H6 at .47, both were medium according to Plonsky and Oswald (2014). H4 had a small effect size at .35, whereas H5 was modest (.24) and H8 was weak (.09). According to the criteria indicated by Cohen and his associates (2011), H2 could be classified as having a strong effect size, while H6 and H4 were moderate. Figure 2 shows the schematic representation of the recursive model of IDLE. Path coefficients were put on the pathways from each latent variable to other variables to demonstrate the strength of relationships among the variables. Notably, the intercorrelations of the four exogenous variables were all significant and strong, but not marked to simplify the model.

The explanatory power of independent variables is measured by $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ whose value represents the percentage of the variation in the two dependent variables. With its value ranging from 0 to 1, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ was considered weak at .19, moderate at .33, and substantial at .67 (Chin, 1998). In this study, $5 5 . 2 \%$ of the total variance of IDLE practices was explained by the three exogenous variables, namely Authentic L2 experience, Resource and cognition, and frequency and devices. Altogether $5 8 . 6 \%$ of the total variance of IDLE-enhanced benefits could be explained by all the five exogenous variables. In this sense, the results reveal that there existed a relatively high degree of explanatory power in the hypothesized model.

# 5.  Discussion

This study sets out to establish an expanded IDLE model in the mainland Chinese context, with its six component factors, namely IDLE practices, Others and support, Authentic L2 experience, Resources and cognition, Frequency and devices, along with IDLE-enhanced benefits. The results of the casual path analysis evince five direct effects of four exogenous variables on two endogenous variables, revealing the inter-factorial relationships among the sub-constructs of the proposed structural model.

Based on the quantitative results presented above, the conceptual framework of IDLE is generated to further illustrate the expanded notion of IDLE as proposed in the literature review (see Figure 3). This framework demonstrates that IDLE activities may not necessarily fall into a particular either-or category that consists of extracurricular or extramural activities but can be moving across a continuum of two extremes dynamically in a given context. It highlights that the extramural is self-directed, naturalistic, and unstructured, whereas the extracurricular self-directed, semi-structured, and self-instructed. As mentioned in the literature review, a convertible part may be visually represented by the triangle at the interface of extracurricular (red) and extramural learning (blue) in Figure 3, considered a part of extracurricular IDLE, with the potential and tendency to transform into extramural IDLE. The following sections elaborate on how the newly established sub-constructs of IDLE expand the original notion of IDLE to fill in three different, expanded, white zones in the model, indicated by the dotted lines.

# 5.1.  Others and support

It is noted that the first newly created and validated sub-construct is Others and support, which sheds new light on Lee and Dressman (2018)

![](img/7f0effa42d8ca92fd7edcfe9ba60fdc09f18c79b5245f451b6d6c705336fe137.jpg)  
Figure 3. An expanded conceptual framework of ID LE (EC: extracurricular; EM : extramural).

understanding of IDLE. Previous studies have addressed the out-of-class feature of IDLE in terms of its location (Burston, 2015; Jensen, 2017; Lee, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c; Sun et  al., 2017; Sung et  al., 2015); however, what prior literature has not taken into account is within such a location feature, there exists a distinction between settings and the modes of practice they support, which might be of great importance, according to Benson (2011), to “avoid simplistic inferences about learning from descriptions of settings” (p. 15). The study addresses this gap by following Benson’s (2011) definition of setting as “an arrangement for learning”, which involves “more than one learner situated in relationships with important others” (p. 13) in addition to location to propose the first new sub-construct: Others and support. The expanded model can provide fresh insights in that it signifies the relationship between extramural and extracurricular as dynamic and probably depending on the settings in which the students are learning. In tune with previous findings with regard to the facilitative role of peers and teachers in language learners’ autonomous participation in online informal learning of English (He et  al., 2021; He & Zhu, 2017; Lai et  al., 2018; Lai & Gu, 2011), the results confirm that IDLE practices initiated by important others in informal settings are a valid sub-construct (Others and support) in the model and can positively predict IDLE-enhanced benefits (H2). This demonstrates that practices initiated by important others that can move from self-instructed to naturalistic and semi-structured to unstructured dynamically across the two continuums of pedagogy and formality (the lower-right white triangle) can be a significant part of IDLE as well and a sub-construct that predicts learners’ IDLE-related practices, marked by the lower, white triangle in the model (Figure 3). In addition, as elaborated in Section 2.2.1, Others and support may not necessarily be part of extracurricular IDLE but serves as a new component of the expanded IDLE to further illustrate the situated nature of learners’ IDLE practices.

The finding also suggests that the expanded IDLE can serve as a source of learners’ autonomous learning, instead of forcing a fixed, binary categorization and eliminating possibilities for learners to develop agency from activities that are initiated by others but directed by themselves. Respond to Lai’s (2017) call for expanding the English learning outcomes in informal and digitalized settings. IDLE-enhanced benefits in this model consist of learners’ perceived usefulness and the affective orientations of learner attitudes. Teacher and peer support such as encouragement and advice-seeking have been significant positive predictors of effort expectancy, which influenced different patterns of technology use in out-of-class learning (Lai et  al., 2018). Defined as the technology-enhanced learning that language learners engage in outside the classroom”, out-of-class learning embodies a broader notion than

IDLE (Lai et  al., 2018, p. 115). In this respect, this study corresponds with Lai and her colleagues’ (2018) findings on the significant and positive role that important others play; however, differently, our study redefines Others and support to measure (a) IDLE practices that are encouraged by the teachers; (b) sharing and collaboration with peers; (c) establishing networking as resources; and (d) seeking advice from others using technology in IDLE. Therefore, Others and support, akin to other IDLE practices, is constantly shifting in a continuum between two extremes: self-directed and other-initiated activities, but more towards the other-initiated end.

# 5.2.  Authentic L2 experience

The second contribution to the existing literature is the establishment and validation of another new sub-construct, Authentic L2 experience, including using English to participate in social media, gaming, and other authentic communicative or literacy activities naturally. Unlike Others and support which is positioned at the interface of extracurricular and extramural learning, Authentic L2 experience moves beyond the two dimensions of learning, starting from the naturalist extreme in the pedagogy continuum and the semi-structured extreme in the formality continuum (the upper-right, white triangle) to serve as a new IDLE component in the model (Figure 3). The results from this study, first and foremost, point out that Authentic L2 experience contributes to learners’ language skills training practices (IDLE practices H3). These activities can be more towards the end of other-initiated than extramural activities since they are highly social, meaning that they can be encouraged or initiated by their peers, friends, etc. This further validates this triangle in the model as a sub-construct that predicts learners’ IDLE-related practices. In mainland China, browsing English content or interactions with English speakers across the world is conducive to the development of learners’ linguistic skills, which has gained support from scholars in regions such as Hong Kong (Lee, 2021).

In addition, the finding regarding the limited effects of Authentic L2 experience on IDLE-enhanced benefits (H4) contrasts with the empirical evidence that engaging students with popular culture and authentic materials in digitalized and out-of-school contexts can beget a set of emotional benefits and improved intercultural awareness (Lee & Drajati, 2019; Lee & Dressman, 2018; Özdemir, 2017; Yang, 2013). It can be possibly attributed to mainland Chinese learners’ rather instrumental motivation towards using English social media and platforms confirmed by H4 for language skills enhancement.

# 5.3.  Resources and cognition

The third significant exogenous variable is Resources and cognition. Learners’ cognitive learning has been proved to positively predict actual behaviour in informal digital learning and play a fundamental role in cultivating digital competence (He et al., 2021). This study further confirms this effect through demonstrating the significant predicting power of cognitive and metacognitive ability in tapping learning resources (Resources and cognition) on both IDLE-enhanced benefits (H6) and IDLE practices (H5). H5 indicates that the more learners use technology to find, select, synthesize, and use English learning materials, the more they are likely to be engaged in practicing the four language skills. These activities can move across two continuums of self-instructed-naturalistic and semi-structured-unstructured as follows. Firstly, Resources and cognition as self-instructed, unstructured activities require learners’ autonomy in agentively exploring resources in an unstructured manner and enhancing their skills (occupying the lower-left white triangle) in varying manners. Secondly, it is common for learners to expand their knowledge to prepare for assignments and projects, which makes the activities semi-structured since it is in-between the extracurricular and instructed settings. Finally, two items under IDLE practices concern learners’ practices of using knowledge-sharing and video-watching platforms, which are naturalistic IDLE practices. The above-mentioned experiences constitute the two white triangles as newly established areas, which do not necessarily require a third angle since learners exercise agency to participate in various activities, shifting dynamically in the middle of the three continuums within the model.

Listening to English news/songs/podcasts and watching sports/comics/ movies/dramas was included in receptive IDLE activities and failed to determine willingness to communicate (Lee & Drajati, 2019). Speaking has been established as a component of IDLE practices (Lee &Lee, 2019) and both form- and meaning-focused IDLE activities have a significant impact on speaking and productive vocabulary knowledge (Lee, 2019b). Reading newspapers, magazines, books, and writing posts were included in meaning-focused activities in the diversity of IDLE, which correlated positively with the willingness to communicate online and speaking (Lee & Dressman, 2018). Writing was included in the diversity of IDLE activities (Lai et  al., 2015). H6 foregrounds learners’ awareness and agency of using technology to enhance their understanding of English and search for English learning materials. When they are engaged in such self-instructed activities (Resources and cognition), they are more actively practicing their language skills (IDLE practices). It furthers the existing discussion on the positive role of Resources and Cognition play that, in addition to enhancing learners’ out-of-class mobile-assisted learning (Zhang & Pérez-Paredes, 2019), agency (Godwin-Jones, 2019), and learning experiences (He & Zhu, 2017), it can add to learners’ IDLE-enhanced benefits and IDLE practices.

# 5.4.  Frequency and devices

The construct Frequency and devices is validated as a crucial part of IDLE in the Chinese EFL context and can significantly influence learners’ IDLE practices (H7). The quantity and diversity of learners’ technology use may often accompany their conscious process of utilizing technology to improve their English listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. This accord with He and his colleagues’ (2018) finding in that Resources and cognition exhibits a higher predicting power than Frequency and devices on SP, which means that Resources and cognition has stronger influences on learners’ practices on language skills than the quantity of IDLE. It is new in revealing the weaker predicting effect of Resources and cognition than Others and support on IDLE-enhanced benefits, meaning that Resources and cognition has a lower impact on perceived benefits than support from important others. The results contrast with the insignificant impact of quantity on L2 vocabulary learning (Lee, 2019b) or language skills in formal instruction (Burston, 2015), yet they align with the majority of previous studies that report a positive effect of quantity on L2 learning, with respect to communicative skills (Sundqvist, 2009), vocabulary acquisition (Lee & Dressman, 2018; Sundqvist & Wikström, 2015), and standardized test scores (Lai et  al., 2015; Lee, 2019c; Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012).

In this study, however, quantity (Frequency and devices) fails to predict IDLE-enhanced benefits (H8), showing that the amount of time that learners spend, and the variety of IDLE practices exert no influence on their affective outcome, including perceived enjoyment, usefulness, and ease. It echoes Lee’s (2019c) caution that technology use may not necessarily bring affective learning or L2 outcome due to the different functions and affordances of digital devices. It is also highlighted that there exists no mediating effect of learners’ practices of skills from the quantity and diversity of technology use on the IDLE-enhanced benefits.

Also of interest is that IDLE practices cannot positively predict IDLE-enhanced benefits (H1). It corresponds with previous findings that although learners exert agency to construct IDLE experiences, they may not necessarily benefit from them, akin to out-of-class learning (Doyle & Parrish, 2012; Lai et  al., 2015). A possible interpretation from this study is a new understanding of the degree of enjoyability and usefulness. In formal, instructed settings, it has been acknowledged that communicative activities are perceived to be more enjoyable but hold less effectiveness, whereas the traditional non-communicative activities are more pedagogically effective but may risk increasing language learning boredom (Littlewood, 2010), which is also applicable in digitalized learning settings (Sarfraz et  al., 2015). Therefore, this study contrasts with previous findings in those skills, communicative, and literacy practices predict neither learners’ perceived effectiveness nor enjoyableness. A drastic twist is that the newly established sub-constructs of IDLE, activities initiated and encouraged by important others and resource-seeking practices both contribute to learners’ perceived enjoyableness and effectiveness $( \mathbf { H } 2 \ \& \ \mathbf { H } 6 )$ . The results may suggest that instead of engaging in recreational IDLE practices, mainland Chinese undergraduates seek socialized, unstructured, self-directed resource-exploring IDLE opportunities, which in turn, empower them with a sense of achievement and satisfaction.

# 6.  Conclusion

This study developed a hypothesized model of IDLE in the Chinese EFL context through adopting an SEM approach based on a validated questionnaire and collected quantitative data. The results indicate that this expanded model of IDLE has been testified reasonably valid and reliable in the mainland Chinese context. It reveals that whereas Chinese university learners’ IDLE practices can be positively predicted by resources regulation and support from important others, and Authentic L2 experience, their IDLE practices are not necessarily related to IDLE-enhanced benefits. These two factors together with Resources and cognition contribute to learners’ practices of language skills, communication, and literacy activities beyond the classroom and the offline context.

From the pedagogical perspective, instead of resorting to learning materials and activities with a high level of formality and instructional features, it behoves teachers to move the locus of control to the learners, enabling them to benefit from IDLE activities that are initiated by important others but instructed by learners themselves (Benson, 2011; Lai et  al., 2015). This is extra critical for East Asian contexts, not limited to mainland China, where in-class, formal, and instructed learning is relied on heavily (Lee & Dressman, 2018). Attention shall be paid to how learners engage with technology to develop their IDLE practices. These activities can as well be encouraged by the teachers to introduce more materials from popular culture and authentic contexts to enable the learners to gain a sense of confidence, enjoyment, accomplishment, and capability of learning. Raising learners’ awareness by explicitly informing them of their needs and the benefits of effective learning could be beneficial to achieving these goals.

This study has several limitations. It was based on the experiences of a group of EFL mainland Chinese undergraduate students, with a particular age range (Table 2). Moreover, the finding confirms the expansion of IDLE and the IDLE learning outcomes but does not reveal the effect of this new notion of IDLE on other psycholinguistic variables and standardized test performance. Based on contextual variances, future studies are recommended to validate this model in their own contexts by rechecking reliability and validity and adding or deleting components and/or subcomponents. In addition to the six steps that have been reported in this study, Kline (2015) suggested two optional steps in SEM, to replicate and apply the results. Although few empirical studies have made efforts to replicate previous findings in the field of Applied Linguistics, L2 replication research has gained growing attention because it can serve as a means to refine results, testify generalizability, triangulate findings to arrive at more stable conclusions (Gass et  al., 2021), and generate more academic exposures and citations (Marsden et  al., 2018). Most existing SEM studies are also one-shot that they have never been replicated and there exist few examples of the application of results from SEM analyses. Therefore, it is recommended that future studies draw on this expanded model of IDLE and its measures to replicate the results and apply them to more diverse contexts.

# Appendix B.  Finalized questionnaire (bilingual version)

# Some words before the questionnaire

We would like to invite you to take part in our questionnaire survey on Chinese undergraduate students’ informal digital learning of English (IDLE). IDLE can be understood as self-directed, autonomous English learning practices in out-of-class and digital environments where learners are motivated by personal interests or with the facilitation of others (e.g. teachers, peers). Kindly notice that what distinguishes IDLE from your other types of online learning activities either inside or outside the classroom is that you are totally self-directed and it has few connections with your classroom learning in terms of syllabus or pedagogy. Also, you are expected to take the survey on the basis of your IDLE experiences instead of what you experienced in formal instruction. If you still have questions regarding IDLE or the questionnaire requirements, please complete the questionnaire later after you have consulted your teachers or contacted us. The content of this questionnaire will be kept strictly confidential and for our own data analysis and research purposes only, thank you very much for your participation and help!

# 问卷前的一些话

我们想邀请您参加我们关于中国本科生英语非正式数字化学习（IDLE）的问卷调查。IDLE 可以理解为在课外和数字环境中, 学习者出于个人兴趣或在他人（如教师、同伴）的帮助下进行的自我导向、自主的英语学习实践。请注意, IDLE 与你在课堂内外的其他类型的在线学习活动的不同之处在于, 你是完全自主的, 它与你的课堂学习在教学大纲或教学法上几乎没有联系。另外, 你要根据你的 IDLE 经验而不是你在正式教学中的经验来调查。如果您对 IDLE 或问卷要求仍有疑问, 请在咨询老师或与我们联系后再完成问卷。本问卷的内容将被严格保密, 仅用于我们自己的数据分析和研究目的,非常感谢您的参与和帮助!
