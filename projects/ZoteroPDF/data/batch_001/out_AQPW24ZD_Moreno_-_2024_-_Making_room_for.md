Research articles in English have witnessed a growing emphasis on self-promotion, posing challenges for Spanish social scientists when writing for English-medium journals. One difficulty lies in effectively promoting their own research without compromising necessary content and exceeding word limits. To address this issue, this study explores strategies for making room for research promotion in the discussion/closing sections of social science research articles. A comparative analysis of these sections in English and Spanish was conducted, focusing on the communicative functions fulfilled by different segment types. The findings confirm that authors in English prioritise promoting the quality and applicability of their research over its contribution and relevance. They also reveal that these authors tend to include fewer non-promotional segments restating results, providing background information, and elaborating ideas compared to their Spanish counterparts. However, both groups of authors consistently include segments commenting on the results, as well as making recommendations for future research/practice. These segments are considered essential in this part-genre. This study provides insights for Spanish social scientists balancing self-promotion and other communicative goals in English research writing. The practical implications extend to English for research publication instruction, as well as the work of reviewers and editors of English-medium journals.

# 1. Introduction

The research article (RA), preferred by researchers in most fields for disseminating their findings, represents a widely used academic genre (Hyland, 2021). Over time, its linguistic features and generic structure have evolved (Atkinson, 1992; Berkenkotter and Huckin, 1995; Hang et al., 2021; Lorés-Sanz, 2016; Swales, 1990), with the changes in the generic structure occurring mainly at the micro-level (e.g., Al-Shujairi, 2021; Kanoksilapatham, 2005; Li and Ge, 2009; Pérez-Llantada, 2013). These diachronic changes have been attributed to various educational, socio-cultural, economic, political, and historical factors that influence researchers’ work and writing practices (e.g., Hyland and Jiang, 2018; Moreno, 2021; Salager-Meyer, 1999; Swales, 1990). Notably, RA introduction, discussion, and conclusion sections, published in English-medium journals (henceforth, English) have been found to be more promotional of the authors’ own work compared to those published in other languages, such as Persian and Spanish (Amirian et al., 2008; Martín and León Pérez, 2014; Moreno, 2022a; Sheldon, 2019).

Spanish social scientists face challenges when writing RA discussion and closing (DC) sections for publication in English (Gea-Valor et al., 2014; Pérez-Llantada, Plo and Ferguson, 2011). These sections require highlighting the research as “sound, significant, and worthy of publication” (Flowerdew, 1999, p. 259; see also Pérez-Llantada, 2012). Based on evidence from social science informants at the University of Zaragoza, it has been suggested that reviewers focus mainly on two ways of promoting research: justifying the study’s relevance and highlighting its strengths (Pérez-Llantada, 2012, p. 128). Given reviewers’ gatekeeping function in the publication process, researchers may benefit from explicit training in how to effectively promote their work in English-language RA DC sections. However, including additional own-research promotion statements would result in longer texts, which is problematic considering the word limits imposed by journals. Moreover, Spanish social scientists tend to employ “long sentences, verbosity and wordiness” (Pérez Llantada, 2012, p. 100), further exacerbating the challenge of adhering to these limits.

Spanish social scientists may thus wonder what ideas and necessary content could be reduced to make room for promoting their own research. This question may initially be thought ill-considered, as the amount and type of other ideas expected in these sections depends on factors such as section length, preceding content, number of research questions, authors’ academic background, familiarity with the genre, and intended audience. However, previous contrastive studies comparing rhetorical structures across English and Spanish academic writing (e.g., RA abstracts; book reviews; PhD thesis introductions; RA introductions; RA DC sections) suggest that the question is in fact justifiable (Lorés-Sanz and Murillo, 2018; Martín and León Pérez, 2014; Martín Martín, 2003; Moreno, 2021, 2022b; Moreno and Suárez, 2008; Sheldon, 2019; SolerMonreal et al., 2011). These studies reveal consistent differences in the rhetorical configuration of the texts, reflecting culture-specific intellectual styles, literacy practices, and scholarly traditions.

While the degree of conventionality of the moves-steps (Swales, 1981, 1990, 2004) in DC sections in English (Cotos et al., 2016; Holmes, 1997; Yang and Allison, 2003) and in English compared to other languages including Persian, Sudanese, Arabic, and Spanish has received increasing attention (Amirian et al., 2008; Arabi, 2019; Boonyuen and Tangkiengsirisin, 2018; ElMalik and Nesi, 2008; Moyeta, 2016; Sheldon, 2019), little comparative research exists on the extent to which each function is realised in social science (SSC) fields other than applied linguistics (AL). Moyeta’s (2016) study exploring DC functions in psychology offers some insights but lacks quantitative data on the number of meaningful segments contributing to realising each function. Furthermore, the comparison of English as L1 with Argentinian Spanish in that study may not reflect the rhetorical conventions of Castilian Spanish. Thus, while previous research has compared the number of meaningful segments employed by authors to promote their own research in English and Castilian Spanish (henceforth, Spanish) DC sections in SSC fields other than AL (Moreno, 2021, 2022a), the appropriate balance between research promotion and non-promotion communicative functions in such fields across English and Spanish remains understudied.

The present study aims to address this gap by comparing the rhetorical efforts made to develop promotion and nonpromotion communicative functions in the same two comparable samples as those in Moreno (2021, 2022a), to continue exploring the same two writing contexts. The rhetorical efforts made in developing a given communicative function will be measured in terms of the number of meaningful text segments, from a genre analytical perspective, employed to fulfil it. By identifying differences in the rhetorical efforts put into developing comparable promotion and non-promotion communicative functions, Spanish social scientists and English for research publication purposes (ERPP) professionals, can gain insights into which types of text segments can be reduced, to which extent, in order to appropriately promote their own research in English.

This investigation is situated within the framework of intercultural rhetoric (IR) research (Connor, 2011), as adapted in Moreno (2021) for applied purposes. The meaningful text segments compared were derived from Moreno’s (2021) annotated sample of 20 RA DC sections (10 English; 10 Spanish) in non-AL SSC fields. The annotations follow Moreno and Swales’s (2018) adaptation of the standard move analysis methodology (Swales, 1981, 1990, 2004) for cross-cultural comparisons. Sections 1.1.-1.3 provide a brief overview of the IR approach, relevant cross-cultural comparisons of communicative functions in SSC RA DC sections, and previous studies elucidating the distinction between research promotion and non-promotion functions.

# 1.1. Intercultural rhetoric

Intercultural rhetoric (IR) is a branch of intercultural pragmatics (Kecskes, 2013) focussed on the necessary rhetorical adaptations in cross-linguistic communication. Building on the revisited Contrastive Rhetoric (CR) hypothesis (e.g., Connor, 2004), IR provides a framework to understand the need for such adaptations. Recent developments in CR research (Connor, 2011; Moreno, 2021) suggest that certain rhetorical features of similar genres differ across cultures, even among expert members of the discourse communities. In the context of writing in ERPP by Spanish authors, IR explores the divergent features between English and Spanish that pose writing obstacles (WOEs, Moreno et al., 2012), requiring accommodation. For instance, Spanish social scientists revising their rejected manuscripts in English due to an overuse of Contribution statements in RA introductions exemplify this need for revision (Mur Dueñas, 2014). CR in the IR framework, with its pedagogical orientation, primarily emphasises identifying divergent trends across cultures rather than individual variations, providing insights into the need for specific types of revisions.

Recent IR studies in ERPP have undergone a shift in focus. Earlier research compared English as L1 to other languages (e.g., Arabi, 2019; Del Saz Rubio, 2011; Moyeta, 2016). However, most recent studies have started comparing English as a lingua franca with other languages (e.g., Lorés-Sanz & Murillo, 2018; Moreno, 2021). The latter variant better reflects the rhetoric used in current ERPP publication contexts (Pérez-Llantada, 2012). Although the connection between researchers’ rhetorical preferences and a national culture is becoming less relevant (Baker, 2016), I argue that such a connection is still noticeable in RAs written by Spanish social scientists, given their recent engagement in scientific interactions in English.

To investigate this further, this study aims to compare the rhetorical efforts made by authors of RA DC sections in SSC other than AL to fulfil research promotion and non-promotion communicative functions across two writing contexts: 1) Englishmedium journals (edited outside Spain), representing a hybrid academic writing culture shaped by English as a lingua franca and multicultural influences (Holliday, 2022); and 2) Spanish-medium journals edited in Spain, reflecting the culture within which Spanish social scientists have traditionally operated.

# 1.2. Cross-cultural studies of communicative purposes in SSC DC sections

Comparative research on the generic structure of RA DC sections across English and other languages has witnessed growing interest in exploring cultural variations (Amirian et al., 2008; Moreno and Swales, 2018; Sheldon, 2019). While some studies compare sections in English by “native” and “non-native” speakers such as Thai, Sudanese and sometimes unstated languages, providing insights into specific communicative functions, or “steps” in Swales’ terms, they lack quantitative data on the rhetorical efforts invested in realising them (Amnuai and Wannaruk, 2013; ElMalik and Nesi, 2008; Peacock, 2002). To offer more illuminating IR perspectives, cross-cultural studies should provide comparable data on communicative functions in authors’ L1. A few studies have achieved this across English, other languages as L1 such as Persian and Spanish, and English as L2, but only in AL (Amirian et al., 2008; Sheldon, 2019).

A further challenge that hinders meaningful comparisons across studies is the inconsistency in proposed move labels in genre analysis of DC sections (see a review in Moreno and Swales, 2018). Additionally, these studies often fail to differentiate between text segments that advance propositional meaning and those that serve supporting roles. Exceptions include Boonyuen and Tangkiengsirisin (2018), Cotos et al. (2016), and Sheldon (2019), who addressed specific segments whose function was Previewing the discussion ‘road map’, Managing the section, and Exemplifying, respectively. To establish valid and relevant cross-cultural-linguistic comparisons, Moreno and Swales’s (2018) modified Swales’ move analytical methodology (Swales, 1981, 1990, 2004), distinguishing between “nuclear” and “non-nuclear” communicative functions. Their aim was to differentiate the move-step segments advancing propositional meaning relevant to the overall purpose of the (part-)genre from those segments with supporting roles, such as announcements and elaborations. It also proposed labelling the corresponding segments based on their specific function before determining their general function. In this paper, the term “communicative function” rather than “move-step” is preferred when referring to rhetorical functions, to encompass not only moves-steps but also announcing and elaborating functions, in line with Moreno and Swales’s (2018) framework.

In their ground-breaking study, Moreno and Swales (2018) proposed a coding scheme for DC sections, later refined and validated with SSC authors in Moreno (2021) (see Appendix B). This scheme consists of seven general communicative functions, including five nuclear functions, or moves ‘proper’: Background-information-for-the-Discussion (BGI), Summarisingor-restating-key-results (SUM), Commenting-on-key-results-or-other-features (COMM), Evaluating-and/or-situating-theresearch (EV) and Drawing-implications-for-future (IMP), each comprising various specific communicative functions, or steps. Additionally, there are two non-nuclear functions: Announcing functions (AF) and Elaborating functions $( \mathrm { E L F } ^ { 1 } )$ (see examples in Section 3). Studies based on this coding scheme shed light on the distinction between the research promotion and nonpromotion communicative functions in such a coding scheme. These studies, together with other relevant literature, are reviewed in the following section.

# 1.3. (Non-)promotion communicative functions in DC sections

Research promotion involves assigning positive value to the reported research and supporting perspectives, while attributing negative value to opposing viewpoints (Afros and Schryer, 2009). Lindeberg (2004) distinguished between two types of explicit research promotion strategies in SSC DC sections: direct and indirect. Direct research promotion includes evaluative statements that enhance the authors’ contribution, such as Claims of centrality, Explicit boost of the writers’ own contribution and Gaps in previous research. Indirect research promotion, on the other hand, encompasses statements that highlight the shortcomings of the contribution to increase the authors’ credibility, such as Limitations and caveats, or emphasise the interest and fruitfulness of the research for future investigations, such as Suggestions for future research.

Moreno (2021) built upon Lindeberg’s (2004) distinction and examined English/Spanish differences in the own-research promotion efforts within a sample of 20 SSC RA DC sections (10 English; 10 Spanish) annotated for their communicative functions. The study considered Lindeberg’s (2004) Explicit boost of the writers’ own contribution strategy as a broad category of direct promotion incorporating three steps from Moreno and Swales’s (2018) coding scheme: Contribution of the current study, Positive features of the current study and Applicability of results or usability of outcomes. Additionally, the study expanded on research promotion strategies by including the Hypothesising for future research function as a case of indirect research promotion, as it proposes directions for further research without making explicit recommendations. In the coding scheme, specific functions, or steps, realising the EV and IMP moves were classified as research promotional, while those in the BGI,

SUM and COMM moves were considered research non-promotional (see Appendix B). For similar reasons, in the present study ELF segments were conceptualised as non-promotional, while AF segments could be either promotional or not depending on the type of segment announced.

Moreno (2021) conducted a quantitative exploration of the move segments and demonstrated that, overall, the SSC RA DC sections published in English were more promotional of the researchers’ own work compared to those in Spanish. However, it remained unknown whether the differences across the two writing contexts persisted when non-nuclear segments were included. The study also found the sections in Spanish were less directly promotional according to Lindeberg’s (2004) criteria. To explain these findings, interviews with a sample of the authors revealed that Spanish SSC authors’ relative reluctance to highlight positive features of their own study may be influenced by cultural factors, such as their greater observance of the principle of modesty. Additionally, their lower inclusion of segments regarding the applicability of results could be attributed to the recent implementation of research assessment policies in Spain, which emphasise the societal impact of research (e.g., Ley de la Ciencia, la Tecnología y la Innovación, 2011). Furthermore, their greater inclusion of contribution claims, aligned with previous findings (Mur Dueñas, 2014) and could be attributed to their familiarity with journals that often require clear statements of contribution.

In another study based on the same annotated sample of DC sections, Moreno (2022a) showed that authors in English were more indirectly promotional by including more statements of limitations, as per Lindeberg’s (2004) classification. The primary reasons for including limitations were similar in both publication contexts, i.e., preventing readers from overgeneralizing findings, and providing cautionary notes about what cannot be concluded. However, the study revealed that the authors had less obvious motivations. Spanish authors used Limitations mainly to create opportunities for future research, while authors in English appeared to state limitations also for indirect promotion and impression management purposes. Notably, no previous studies explored potential differences between English and Spanish SSC RA authors in their efforts to be indirectly promotional by making recommendations for future research or practice or by hypothesising for future research (see Appendix B).

The present study contributes to our understanding of the rhetorical conventions in SSC DC sections across English and Spanish in three ways. Firstly, it compares authors’ rhetorical efforts to fulfil unexplored communicative purposes. Secondly, it contrasts the balance between research promotion and non-promotion, encompassing all segment types. Lastly, it integrates the findings with previous research into a comprehensive framework providing a useful contrastive picture for ERPP in the social sciences other than AL (henceforth, SSC).

# 2. Methods

This section details the sample, units of analysis, and variables for comparison, and the statistical tests employed to interpret the observed differences.

# 2.1. The comparable samples

The text sample of 20 included 10 comparable pairs of RA DC sections in English and Spanish. These RAs, part of the SSC component of the EXEMPRAES Corpus (Moreno, 2013, June), were published in 2004–2012. This sample size was considered sufficient for identifying specific communicative function in a well-focused part-genre, as it exceeds the threshold established by Moreno and Swales (2018), who found that no new steps were likely to emerge after the analysis of 12 texts. The 20 RAs, which were independently written and not translations of each other, were recommended by expert informants as comparable counterparts within each language pair. Five pairs in the selected SSC sample, which excludes AL, belong to Business and Economics, and five to Pedagogy, Psychology, and Sociology (see detailed references and codes, e.g., SSC02ENG, in Appendix A). Table 1 quantifies the average sizes of the RAs and their corresponding DC sections.

Table 1 Word count of English (Eng.) and Spanish (Sp.) social science (SSC) empirical research article (RA) discussion/closing (DC) sections.

Table 1 reveals that the English RAs overall demonstrate greater length in terms of word count, while Spanish DC sections tend to be longer. However, as established by Moreno (2021), the count of move segments across both samples of DC sections was nearly identical (458/462), averaging around 46 segments per section. This suggests comparable rhetorical efforts by both English and Spanish DC section authors. Furthermore, the pairs display extensive similarity in terms of topic, study type, audience, and persuasive power, as stated by the expert informants. Thus, the sample achieves superior match and equivalence concerning variables known to impact the generic structure of texts (Moreno, 2021). Notably, English RAs were written by authors from various countries (i.e., the UK, the USA, Canada, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands) whose mother tongue was not Spanish, thus representing the intended population of English as a lingua franca researchers. In contrast, the Spanish RAs were edited in Spain and predominantly authored by Spaniards, with one Argentinian exception.

# 2.2. The comparable units

In discerning where authors exerted the most or least rhetorical effort in discussing their findings and drawing conclusions, the sections needed to be segmented into smaller, comparable units of analysis. These units, serving as the tertium comparationis at lower levels of text analysis (Connor and Moreno, 2005) were established by Moreno’s (2021) annotations for communicative functions in this sample. These meaningful text segments or units were not necessarily orthographic sentences, unlike those in Holmes (1997) and Moyeta (2016), nor specific words or phrases. Instead, they encompassed text fragments containing at least one meaningful proposition as perceived from a modified move analytical perspective within the framework of a DC section. The coding scheme in Appendix B was employed to discern the meaningfulness of these fragments in terms of specific and general communicative functions.

The segmentation and labelling approach of this study may yield results that are not immediately comparable to those from studies adopting different units of analysis or coding schemes (e.g., Moyeta, 2016; Sheldon, 2019). For instance, a genre analyst utilising sentence-based units may consider the text fragment “The attempted femicides were an independent sample, giving important validation for the revised DA.” (SSC03ENG) as one unit. In contrast, this study segmented it into two: the first clause, interpreted as a description of a Key feature of the current study, and the second clause, viewed as a Positive feature of the current study according to the coding scheme in Appendix B. However, not every proposition within the texts was segmented and labelled. The complex sentence:

“[Perhaps the arithmetic curriculum [offered in primary schools]1 poses less of a challenge to children from advantaged backgrounds]2 [as they tend to master the arithmetic skills (e.g. counting, multiplication, subtraction, addition) relatively easily and early in their primary school career,]3 [by which, as a result, their arithmetic progress is rather limited thereafter.]4” (SSC04ENG)

was segmented into two units, each comprising two propositions. This segmentation resulted from the perception of meaning when propositions were combined, as guided by the coding scheme. Specifically, the first two propositions were interpreted as Explaining a result, a step within the Commenting on Key results or other features move, and the latter two as a Justification for the explanation, one of the Elaborating functions.

Moreover, the results of this study may not align with those from studies that examine the “functions” of metadiscourse items (Hyland, 2007; Murillo, 2012). For example, Hyland (2007) considered all instances of “e.g.” as valid exemplifications, whereas this study identified only those segments fulfilling that function and containing a meaningful proposition. Therefore, the text fragment “however, they should be studied in relation to (other) normative beliefs (e.g. peer and social network influence) and control beliefs (e.g. cost-related aspects, the need for requisite knowledge, etc.)” (SSC05ENG) was segmented and labelled as a meaningful unit not because of the exemplifications but because it was interpreted as a Recommendation for future, a step in the Implications for future move. Hence, for fragments to be annotated as Exemplification in this study, they needed to illustrate another meaningful proposition. For instance, the excerpt, “. in regions with low levels of social capital, it is necessary for firms to invest more in. For instance, they can promote meetings, partnerships, and communication with other firms and organizations..” (SSC08ENG.38) is an example that elucidates how to implement the Recommendation for future stated in the preceding proposition. For a more detailed explanation of the segmentation protocol, refer to Moreno and Swales (2018).

# 2.3. The rhetorical variable

The rhetorical variable of interest, defined as the level of rhetorical effort exerted by authors to accomplish a specific/ general communicative function in SSC RA DC sections, was operationalised as the frequency of occurrence of meaningful text segments realising the same function in the corresponding sub-sample.

# 2.4. Statistical analyses

The relative frequency of segments performing a certain communicative function was calculated against the total frequency of meaningful segments, rather than normalizing it by word count. To discern whether the distribution of the two sub-samples of comparable segments differed among various communicative functions or categories, a chi-square test of independence was conducted, since no assumption about the normality of the distributions could be made. For this purpose, the chi-square calculation was carried out for a contingency table with a maximum of five rows and columns (Chi–Square Test Calculator, 2018), as most conditions (sample size, expected cell counts, and independence) were met. The communicative functions under comparison and the writing contexts dEnglish and Spanishd in each test were placed in the rows and columns, respectively.

Due to the compilation requirement for the EXEMPRAES corpus, the expert informants might not have used a random approach, marking a possible limitation. To enable comparison with other studies, each communicative function was also characterised by its status (i.e., the percentage of authors typically performing it by at least one meaningful segment, Moreno, 2021) in DC sections. Following Sheldon (2019), a function was classified as obligatory if it occurred at least once in $9 0 { - } 1 0 0 \%$ of the texts; conventional if in $6 0 - 8 9 \%$ ; and optional if in $30 \mathrm { - } 5 9 \%$ . An additional category, non-salient, was created for those occurring in fewer than $3 0 \%$ of texts.

# 3. Results

This section presents the findings on the rhetorical effort of authors in the DC sections of SSC RAs in English and Spanish. As an initial analysis of the data, Table 2 provides an overview of the frequencies of meaningful text segments used by these authors to fulfil general communicative functions in each language. The table categorises the segments into moves, elaborations and announcements, presenting them in descending order of frequency in English, considering the journal’s likely readership.

As shown in Table 2, the distribution of segment types in the DC sections of SSC RAs in English and Spanish provides valuable insights. All moves were obligatory in both samples, except for IMP, which was only conventional in Spanish. These findings align with previous studies by Al-Shujairi (2021), Moyeta (2016), and Yang and Allison (2003), supporting a trend towards standardization in the rhetorical purposes of social science DC sections in English. The contrasting findings also suggest a level of convergence in Spanish, although variants such as Argentinian Spanish may exhibit different patterns (Moyeta, 2016).

Despite their similar status, the relationship between the writing context and the frequency distributions of move segments was significant, $X ^ { 2 } ( 4 , \mathsf N = 9 2 0 ) = 1 2 . 5 1 9 6$ , $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ . While COMM segments were equally prevalent in both contexts, EV and IMP segments were more frequent in English, confirming Moreno’s (2021) findings. Conversely, BGI and SUM segments were more common in Spanish. Regarding the elaborations relative to move segments in general, the relationship approached marginal significance, $X ^ { 2 }$ ( $1 , \mathsf { N } = 1 0 3 9 ) = 3 . 1 2 3 5$ , $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 0 7 7 1 6 9$ , indicating a slightly higher frequency of ELF segments in Spanish. Although this result suggests a potential difference in the frequency of ELF segments in Spanish compared to English, it does not reach the conventional threshold of significance $\mathbf { \tilde { p } } < 0 . 0 5 $ ). It is possible that with a larger sample size, this trend may achieve statistical significance.

When grouping all segments into research promotional (English: 209; Spanish: 170) and non-promotional (English: 341; Spanish: 404), both subsamples exhibit a higher proportion of non-promotional segments. However, a statistically significantly difference in the balance between these two sets of purposes is observed, $X ^ { 2 }$ $1 , \mathsf { N } = 1 1 2 4 ) = 8 . 8 3 2 3$ , $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 1$ , confirming the relatively higher frequency of research promotional segments in English.

The subsequent sub-sections analyse these overall results at the specific communicative function level. The first set of results presented constitute general communicative functions where segment frequency was similar across English and Spanish. The second set includes the specific communicative functions responsible for the identified differences at the general level. The segment types with higher frequency in English are examined first, followed by those with higher frequency in Spanish. The order of presentation within each subsection follows their frequency of occurrence in English.

# 3.1. With similar frequency

In this move, authors comment on their results and/or other features by means of five steps, including establishing the meaning of key results; comparing them with previous research; explaining them or other phenomena; reacting to them; and

making predictions. Examples of segments in this move are provided below, with function signals highlighted in bold. The

As indicated in Table 2, the COMM segments were obligatory in both languages. Table 3 presents the distributions of comment types in English and Spanish languages, listed in descending order of frequency in English.

Table 3 shows that the MEAN and COMP steps were obligatory in both languages. While EXPL was obligatory in Spanish, it was only conventional in English (cf. Arabi, 2019). On the other hand, REACT was conventional in English but only optional in Spanish. PRED was optional in both contexts. No statistically significant differences were found in their frequency distributions, $X ^ { 2 }$ $4 , \mathsf { N } = 2 3 3 ) = 3 . 2 6 1$ , $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 5 1 5 1 3 6$ .

# 3.1.2. Announcing functions (AF)

AFs are text segments that announce the function or content of other text segments in various ways, including announcing moves, steps, or propositions; announcing (sub)sections; and announcing or referring to external sources or other text parts. Examples are provided below.

It is worth noting that while the AF segment at (6S) was considered research promotional, the segment at (6E) was considered non-promotional.

As shown in Table 2 above, AF segments were obligatory in both contexts. Table 4 offers a comparison of their internal distributions.

As indicated in Table 4 above, MSP and SEC were obligatory in both contexts, while EXT was non-salient in either one. No relation between the writing context and the frequency distributions of AF segments, $X ^ { 2 } \left( 2 , \mathrm { N } = 8 5 \right) = 1 . 6 3 4 2$ , $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 4 4 1 7 1 6$ , was found. Nor between it and the frequency distributions of research promotion (English: 15; Spanish: 13) and nonpromotion (English: 28; Spanish: 29) AF segments, $X ^ { 2 } \left( 1 , \mathrm { N } = 8 5 \right) = 0 . 1 4 8 { \overset { \cdot } { 7 } } , \mathrm { p } = 0 . 6 9 9 8 2$ .

This set of results suggests that the conventions for commenting on the results and/or other features, and for announcing other segment types across the two writing contexts are constrained by the DC section part-genre. The following section presents the segment types that were found more frequent in English.

# 3.2. More frequent in English

# 3.2.1. Evaluating or situating the research (EV)

This move involves authors positioning their research in the field by means of five steps, including evaluating specific aspects of their study positively or negatively; making the contribution of their study explicit in relation to past research;

noting gaps or deficiencies in others’ research/practice or identifying a problem; and/or assessing the relevance of the topic positively or evaluating the state of knowledge/practice in the discipline. Examples of each step are provided below. Pointing-out-positive-features-of-the-current-or-proposed-study (POS)

(11E) Another strength is the use of. (SSC06ENG.38)

(13S) .es, la primera vez, que. en el estudio de. [Trans: .it is the first time that. in the study of .] (SSC05SP.49) Noting-gaps-or-deficiencies-in-others’-research-or-practice-or-identifying-a-problem (GAP).

(15S) Una de las líneas más interesantes se refiere al. [Trans: One of the most interesting lines refers to .] (SSC05SP.4)

As indicated in Table 2, EV is the second most frequent function in English, while it ranks fourth in Spanish, suggesting that authors in English tend to be more evaluative of research in general. Table 5 presents the distributions of the EV segments, facilitating a comparison between the two languages.

Table 5 Distribution of EVa segments in social science discussion/closing sections by language.

As shown in Table 5, the evaluative steps had similar statuses, except for CONTR, which was obligatory in English and only conventional in Spanish. However, their frequency patterns differed significantly, $X ^ { 2 }$ $4 , \mathrm { N } = 1 9 9 ) = 1 3 . 7 4 9 2$ , $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 1$ . In English, authors tended to place greater emphasis on highlighting the positive (POS) and negative (LIM) quality of their own research, as well as identifying gaps in previous research to promote the work. On the other hand, in Spanish, authors focussed more on highlighting the novelty, addition, or improvement of their own research compared to previous studies (CONTR). Thus, in agreement with Moreno (2021, 2022a), not only are authors of SSC DC sections in English more evaluative of their own research, but they also emphasize different aspects.

3.2.2. Drawing implications for future (IMP)

In this move, authors draw implications from their results/study for future by means of three possible steps: making recommendations for future practice/research; suggesting the applicability of the current study/results or the usability of its outcomes; or hypothesising for future studies. Examples of each step are provided below.

Making-recommendations-for-future-research-or-practice (REC)

(16S) También debería abordarse en trabajos futuros. [Trans: Future studies should also address .] (SSC07SP.73)

(19E) [Other features ., such as ., seem very relevant interacting variables. (SSC09ENG.26) (19S) Una posible explicación a este fenómeno podría ser. [Trans.: A possible explanation of this phenomenon might be .] (SSC04SP.39)

As shown in Table 2, while IMP was the third most frequent general function in English, it ranked the lowest in Spanish, even lower than elaborations. Table 6 displays the distributions of IMP segments, highlighting the differences between the two languages.

Table 6 Distribution of $\mathrm { I M P ^ { a } }$ segments in social science discussion/closing sections by language.

a IMP $=$ Drawing-implications; $\mathrm { R E C = }$ Recommendation-for-future; APP $=$ Applicability-or-usability-of-results; $\mathrm { H Y P = }$ Hypothesis-for-future-research (Copyright, 2022 by Moreno).

Table 6 demonstrates that REC segments were obligatory in English, with a similar proportion of recommendations for future research than for future practice. In contrast, they were only conventional in Spanish, with a seemingly lower proportion of recommendations for practice compared to research, although no statistical differences were found in the available data $( X ^ { 2 } \left( 1 , \ N = 1 2 8 \right) = 0 . 8 1 8 2$ , $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 3 6 5 7 0 4 _ { . }$ . The other IMP steps were not salient, except for APP in English. The statistically significant relation between the writing context and the distributions of IMP segments, $\overset { \cdot } { X } { } ^ { 2 } \left( 2 , \mathrm { N } = 1 5 2 \right) = 1 0 . 8 5 1 9$ , $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) may be explained by the greater use of APP segments in English, despite them being optional.

# 3.3. More frequent in Spanish

3.3.1. Background information for the discussion (BGI)

BGI segments serve writers to resituate the discussion of results and support their ideas to develop arguments by providing background information that does not fulfil any of the other functions. The possible steps include re-stating a key feature of the current study, reporting information from other studies with citations, and providing information without citations.

Re-stating-a-key-feature-of-current-study (KFS)

Providing-information-without-citations (POC)

(22E) Established techniques often start from ., (SSC05ENG.72) (22S) Como es sabido,. [Trans: As is well known,. ] (SSC05SP.68)

As shown in Table 2, BGI segments were the second most frequent in Spanish, while the least frequent in English. Table 7 compares their frequency distributions within this move.

Table 7 Distribution of BGIa segments in social science discussion/closing sections by language.   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Step</td><td colspan="5">English</td><td colspan="5"> Spanish</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>%</td><td>M</td><td>SD</td><td>Status</td><td>N</td><td>%</td><td>M</td><td>SD</td><td>Status</td></tr><tr><td>KFS</td><td>28</td><td>43.8%</td><td>2.8</td><td>1.9</td><td>100</td><td>40</td><td>40.0%</td><td>4.0</td><td>2.9</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>RWC</td><td>19</td><td>29.7%</td><td>1.9</td><td>2.1</td><td>60</td><td>32</td><td>32.0%</td><td>3.2</td><td>2.2</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>POC</td><td>17</td><td>26.6%</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.2</td><td>60</td><td>28</td><td>28.0%</td><td>2.8</td><td>3.5</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>64</td><td>100.0%</td><td>6.4</td><td>3.7</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>100.0%</td><td>10.0</td><td>7.2</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

a BGI $=$ Background-information; $\mathrm { K F S = }$ Key-feature-of-current-study; RWC $=$ Info-reported-with-citations; POC $=$ Info-provided-without-citations (Copyright, 2022 by Moreno).

Table 7 shows that the KFS and POC steps were obligatory and conventional, respectively, in both contexts, while RWC was obligatory in Spanish but only conventional in English. However, when comparing the frequency distributions of the segment types, no statistically significant difference was obtained, $X ^ { 2 }$ (2 $, \mathsf { N } = 1 6 4 ) = 0 . 2 2 8 8$ , $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 8 9 1 , 8 7 9$ . This means that Spanish authors tend to provide more background information of all the identified types.

3.3.2. Summarising or restating key results (SUM)

Through this move, writers remind readers of the key results of their study. These are usually expressed as particular observations on the data presented as evidence, either neutrally or in contrast with the authors’ own results in a new proposition, as illustrated below.

Presenting-results-neutrally (NRES)

SUM segments were more frequent in Spanish (see Table 2). The distributions of the two identified types are presented in Table 8.

a SUM $=$ Summarizing-or-restating-key-results; NRES $=$ Presenting-result-neutrally (including highlighted results); CRES $=$ Contrasting-with-ownresults (Copyright 2022 by Moreno).

Table 8 shows that both NRES and CRES had the same status in both contexts: obligatory and conventional, respectively. Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was observed in the distribution of the two segment types, $X ^ { 2 }$ (2, $\Nu = 1 7 2 ) = 0 . 4 8 7$ , $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 4 8 5 2 5 9$ , as they are consistently more frequent in Spanish.

# 3.3.3. Elaborating functions (ELF)

ELF segments are text fragments containing at least one proposition that primarily serves to support a move or step rather than acting as independent steps. Their relevance is perceived relative to some neighbouring proposition rather than to the overall purpose(s) of the section, without moving the text forward. The identified functions include justifying, exemplifying, and clarifying, as illustrated below.

Justifying (JUST)

(25E) (. since. (SSC04ENG.39) (25S) Dada la importancia del. [Trans: Given the importance of .] (SSC07SP.38)

Exemplifying (EXEM)

(26E) For example,. (SSC03ENG.20) (26S) Así,. [Trans: Thus, .] (SSC05SP.17)

Clarifying (CLAR)

(27E) In other words,. (SSC08ENG.5) (27S) Es decir,. [Trans: That is, .] (SSC04SP.21)

Table 9 below compares the distributions of ELF segments between the two languages.

a ELF $=$ Elaborating; JUST $=$ Justification; EXEMP $=$ Exemplification; CLAR $=$ Clarification (Copyright 2022 by Moreno).

As shown in Table 9, ELF segments were obligatory in both English and Spanish. Exemplifying segments were optional in English, while they were conventional in Spanish, which differs from previous research by Sheldon (2019) in AL. Fewer clarifications were observed overall, in line with Hyland’s (2007) findings in the soft sciences, and with Murillo (2012). However, caution is warranted when comparing these results due to methodological differences. Importantly, the distribution of ELF segments did not yield a statistically significant cross-cultural difference, $X ^ { 2 } \left( 2 , \mathbf { N } = 1 1 9 \right) = \bar { 3 } . 6 9 5 3$ , $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 1 5 7 6 0 4$ . Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that ELF segments tended to be consistently more frequent in Spanish.

Table 10 provides a summary of the main findings obtained from the comparison between English and Spanish in terms of the rhetorical effort observed in social science discussion/closing sections. The table illustrates the tendencies of social scientists in each language as follows:

Overall, these findings reveal distinctive patterns that may be influenced by writing culture-specific conventions and disciplinary practices. The following section explores their significance and discusses their implications in greater detail.

This study aimed to compare the rhetorical effort made by SSC authors of DC sections in RAs to fulfil research promotional and non-promotional functions across English and Spanish. Building upon Moreno’s (2021) systematic annotations of a sample from the EXEMPRAES Corpus, this study confirms previous cross-cultural findings on research promotional functions and integrates them with new findings into a comprehensive framework (see Table 10 above).

Consistent with previous English/Spanish cross-cultural research, the results of this study provide clear evidence of crosscultural differences in the balance between research promotion and non-promotion in the DC sections of SSC RAs. The analysis revealed that English-speaking social scientists exhibited a relatively higher frequency of research promotional segments compared to their Spanish-speaking counterparts. This difference can be attributed to cultural and socio-political factors (see section 1.3), confirming their significant role in shaping the communicative practices of social scientists across different language contexts. In English, authors tended to be more directly research promotional by highlighting positive features of their studies, the applicability of their results or usability of outcomes, and gaps or deficiencies in previous studies to a greater extent (Moreno, 2021). They also openly discussed more limitations of their research, thus exhibiting a higher inclination to promote their research indirectly (Moreno, 2022a). On the other hand, Spanish social scientists preferred direct research promotion through statements of contribution, positive evaluations of the state of knowledge and the relevance of their research, which can be attributed to their literacy practices (Moreno, 2021). These findings suggest that Spanish authors witing SSC DC in English may need to exert extra effort to effectively promote their research, which might also involve reducing other types of ideas within the word limits imposed by journals.

To investigate strategies for achieving this goal, this study identifies the functions that Spanish authors should prioritise and those that they might consider reducing in RA DC sections in the social sciences (i.e., psychology, pedagogy, sociology, business and economics), filling a gap in the cross-cultural rhetoric literature. Regarding prevalent functions across both languages three key observations were made. First, the move Commenting on the results and/or other features was equally predominant in both contexts, aligning with findings on English AL discussions across other languages such as Thai, Arabic and Spanish (Amnuai, 2013; Arabi, 2019; Sheldon, 2019). This move serves the central communicative focus of the discussion of results section, reviewing the presented results (Swales, 2004). While it may appear in both results and discussion of results sections, it tends to be more frequent in the discussion of results sections (Yang and Allison, 2003). Spanish social scientists are advised not to reduce their rhetorical effort in developing this move, as it constitutes the essence of the DC section. The lack of statistical significance in the distribution of the various steps in this move also suggests that Spanish authors can rely on their intuitions regarding the discussion of results to meet the expectations of DC sections in Englishmedium journals.

Second, the move of Making recommendations for future was similarly frequent. This challenges Berkenkotter and Huckin’s (1995) suggestion of the decline in Suggestions for further research due to increasing competition among researchers. Supporting evidence comes from Peacock (2002, p. 489), who found that recommendations for future research were present in $5 9 \%$ of research articles, and Al-Shujairi (2021, p. 20), who found that making implications, which may include suggestions for future research, remains important across different fields. These findings indicate that Spanish authors writing for publication in English should maintain their effort in making recommendations for future. Furthermore, this move can serve as an indirect means of promoting one’s own research with a persuasive role (Lindeberg, 2004).

Third, the function Announcing other segments appeared less frequently in both writing contexts, in agreement with Cotos et al.’s (2016, p. 49) observation that “Previewing the discussion ‘road map’ occurs at the lowest frequency” in English discussions across multiple disciplines. However, the present study identifies this move as obligatory rather than optional. The disagreement may stem from the more systematic distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear functions employed in this study. The higher frequency of this function supports the use of a modified move analysis methodology (Moreno and Swales, 2018) in future research. Similar functions have been identified in research article introductions, where authors announce the content/purpose of the reported research (Cortes, 2013). Although their frequency may be lower in the discussion sections, the similar length in move-step segment count, complexity, and self-contained nature of the DC sections in this corpus make announcements an equally necessary function to guide readers. Hence, Spanish authors can continue adhering to their rhetorical habits in this regard when writing for publication in English.

Conversely, three functions were found to be more prevalent in Spanish than in English. Contrary to Moyeta’s (2016) characterization of the Background information move as “quasi-obligatory” in the Argentinian Spanish corpus of psychology discussions, this study identifies it as both obligatory and the most frequent function. Spanish authors’ greater effort to discuss the restated results in the context of previous theories aligns with previous research indicating their cultural preference for providing specialised background knowledge rather than evaluating the quality of the work presented (Moreno and Suárez, 2008; Pérez-Llantada, 2012; Soler Monreal et al., 2011). Therefore, Spanish authors may consider reducing their effort in fulfilling this function when writing for publication in English. However, caution should be exercised in comparing these findings with previous studies due to the lack of consistent definitions or definitions altogether. Future research could employ the step-based definitions utilised in this study to explore other disciplines and language pairs for more meaningful comparisons.

Furthermore, this study found a higher tendency among authors in Spanish to elaborate their ideas, consistent with PérezLlantada’s (2012) observations on the syntactic density of their sentences. This may partly explain the longer DC sections in terms of total segment types, despite containing a similar number of move segments. Therefore, Spanish authors in the SSC can slightly reduce the elaboration of their ideas in DC sections for publication in English-medium journals. However, the apparent lower word count of the Spanish DC sections in this study contradicts Pérez-Llantada’s (2012) observations on their verbosity and wordiness. Further intercultural research employing comparable corpora systematically annotated for communicative functions, as in the present work, could shed light on this complex use.

Finally, in contrast to Sheldon’s (2019) characterisation of Stating selected findings as less frequent in Spanish as L1, the current study found that Summarising and/or restating results was the third most frequent move in Spanish, aligning with its obligatory status (Moyeta, 2016; Sheldon, 2019). However, it is important to note that academic rhetorical styles can vary significantly depending on factors such as discipline and specific journal. Accordingly, it is important to exercise caution when comparing the present findings with those in AL. Based on the current comparison, Spanish authors in SCC other than AL could consider reducing the restatement of findings in DC sections to create space for promoting their own research.

# 5. Conclusion

Drawing on the cross-cultural findings presented in this study, it is not surprising that Spanish social scientists are often encouraged by reviewers and editors to highlight the strengths of their research when writing in English (Pérez-Llantada, 2012). To address this challenge, Spanish researchers writing DC sections in English (Gea-Valor et al., 2014) can benefit from developing an awareness of cross-cultural differences, understanding the reasons behind them, and exploring ways to adjust their texts to be more persuasive for an international audience, as suggested in previous work (e.g., Swales and Feak, 2012). These findings are particularly relevant for instructors teaching ERPP to Spanish social scientists, as they can inform the development of pedagogical approaches to help researchers strike a balance between promoting their own research and fulfilling other expected communicative functions without excessively lengthening their manuscripts. Using Table 10 as a pedagogical resource, instructors can encourage Spanish authors to focus on the most significant findings and reduce their reliance on background information and extensive elaboration of ideas in the DC sections. This will help them create space for effective self-promotion of the research. Furthermore, authors can adjust their self-promotion strategies in accordance with expectations by understanding the reasons for these adjustments, as discussed in section 3.2. These pedagogical suggestions contribute to reshaping the teaching and learning of specialised languages to meet the evolving demands of international communication scenarios.

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study, including the small and heterogeneous sample. The manual segmentation and labelling of meaningful segments, as well as their validation with the authors themselves were timeconsuming but enhanced the validity and reliability of the results (Moreno, 2021). Future research with larger subsamples within specific disciplines, as well as across different disciplines, would help to further validate these findings. Employing methods of analysis similar to those used in the present study, such as those developed by Moreno and Swales (2018), would contribute to more meaningful comparisons of findings across studies and increase the overall validity and reliability of cross-cultural research into communicative functions in similar genres.

Despite these limitations, this study paves the way for exploring the transfer of Spanish rhetorical conventions when Spanish social scientists compose their DC sections for publication in English as L2. As demonstrated in this study, traces of national culture coexist with other smaller cultures such as disciplinary cultures, in RA writing contexts, and these influences may not be perceptible unless uncovered through move analysis methods like the ones employed here, in line with Connor’s (2011) observations and contrary to Baker’s (2016) assumption.

Applying accommodation theory to multilingual communication (Sachdev et al., 2013), it is possible that some Spanish authors of SSC RAs in English as L2 have already adopted some of the rhetorical strategies for writing these sections in English, while leaving behind certain Spanish conventions, particularly as more researchers frequently read RAs in English (Moreno et al., 2012). From a pragmatic perspective, this accommodation to Anglo-American academic writing norms can lead to publication success. However, from a socio-critical perspective, such accommodation may imply a devaluation of Spanish social scientists’ rhetorical practices in favour of dominant norms. It is important for editors and reviewers to be aware of existing divergences to ensure the fair evaluation of manuscripts from researchers with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, contributing to a more decolonised research writing culture within English-medium journals.
