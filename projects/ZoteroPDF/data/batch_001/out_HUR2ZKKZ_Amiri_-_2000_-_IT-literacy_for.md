# Abstract

This article examines some of the issues related to the information technology (IT) training of the language teachers in MA TEFL/TESOL courses and argues that teachers at this level should be trained not merely as consumers but as both consumers and producers of computerbased materials. The article focuses on the role of computer programming in MA courses and concludes that knowledge of programming is important for enabling language teachers to get involved in the design and development of computer-based materials and should be included as a part of the IT training for language teachers. It is concluded that there is a need for more specialised MA courses for language teaching that concentrate on various aspects of IT, including end-user programming, learning, instructional design and second language acquisition (SLA) theories. $©$ 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

# 1. Introduction

Nowadays there is a general agreement among teachers and teacher educators that information technology (IT) has become so important, both in our everyday lives and in education, that it is necessary for teachers to know how to use IT eectively in their teaching. Language teachers have usually been at the forefront of using new technologies in their teaching, e.g. record players, tape and cassette recorders, television, video, and now computers. It is understandable, therefore, that most MA degree courses in English as a foreign language (EFL) or teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), in the UK and many other countries, usually have at least one module that deals with IT. These modules normally last for about 10 or 12 weeks with a two or two-and-a-half hour long session in each week. Despite the general agreement on the importance of IT for language teachers, those who are responsible for the IT training face great diculties and dilemmas. This article examines some of these diculties and dilemmas and puts forward some possible solutions. Although the focus of this paper is on post-experience MA teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) or TESOL courses, the same issues could apply to teacher education in other disciplines.

# 2. Problems of IT training for language teachers

Knowing that language teachers need to be IT-literate is one thing, knowing what to teach them in a 10- or 12-week IT module is another. There are, I believe, two main sources of diculty. One is the fact that IT is continually changing and expanding, the other that it is not clear what the position of language teachers towards IT should be.

It is well known that the computer you buy today could well be out of date 4 months later. Six years ago few people had heard of the world wide web (WWW). Today it is hard to imagine the world without it. Even the humble word processor of yesterday has now turned into a powerful mixture of a desktop publishing and multimedia/web authoring package with its own programming language. So, teaching teachers to make full use of the capabilities of a word processor today is very dierent from what it was some years ago and involves a dierent set of skills. Because technology is changing so rapidly it is very dicult to know what the set of core IT skills for language teachers should be. This also makes it dicult for the teachers and teacher educators to keep up to date with the latest developments in IT. Even when certain areas of IT are identi®ed as important for language teachers, say the use of a word processor, e-mail, WWW, multimedia, there is still the problem of what exactly should teachers be taught about these areas. In the case of word processors, for instance, this could range from simple text processing to programming simple multimedia materials. As to the WWW, teachers can be taught how to use it to access existing sites and perhaps develop interesting activities around the materials on these sites (e.g. on-line newspapers) or taken further and taught how to develop their own web pages to suit their teaching needs. The same applies to CD-ROM based and hybrid (i.e. CD and web) materials. Teachers could learn how to choose, evaluate and use the existing computer-based materials, both those which are developed speci®cally for language learning and the general purpose ones (e.g. encyclopaedias), or learn how to develop their own materials using programming (authoring) environments (e.g. ToolBook, Director, HyperCard, Visual Basic).

At any stage of technological development, what is taught to the MA TEFL or TESOL students is decided, among other things, by what is seen as the appropriate position of the language teachers towards IT. An IT module can be based on one of the following two main positions:

1. teachers as mere consumers of computer-based materials; and   
2. teachers as consumers and producers of computer-based materials.

Because of the nature of the MA courses in TEFL or TESOL, whatever is taught in an IT module would be of an introductory nature. For one, the time is normally very limited for anything but a simple introduction to various aspects of IT. However, whether the introduction to WWW would just deal with accessing existing sites and their pedagogical uses, or would also include an introduction to the hypertext mark-up language (HTML), or other languages e.g. JavaScript, for web page design, depends on which of the above positions is adopted.

Traditionally, the IT modules have been based on the ®rst position. Teachers have been trained as mere consumers, be it critical and creative, of computer-based materials. Teachers have been learning about the available CALL materials, how to choose and evaluate them and how to use them in their classes or self-access rooms (e.g. Hardisty and Windeatt, 1989). Recently the use of e-mail and of mere accessing and using the existing WWW pages have been added to the list. Although still necessary and valuable, this approach is no longer sucient. Regardless of which areas of IT are included in an IT module, something which is normally decided on the basis of the speci®c needs of the students who take part in a particular MA course and the available expertise among the sta, the main aim of the module, I believe, should be to train the teachers not merely as consumers but as both consumers and producers of IT materials. So, for instance, if multimedia and the WWW are regarded as important and, therefore, included in an IT module, then teachers should also be introduced to design and development of multimedia materials and web pages.

Since the production of most modern IT materials usually involves a certain degree of programming (scripting), the implication would be that language teachers need to be introduced to programming during their IT modules. The idea that language teachers would bene®t from learning to program is not new. Many years ago Higgins (1985, p. 76) argued that all teachers should be oered \`\`the opportunity to learn programming.'' Almost 15 years later, his idea is still waiting to be materialised.

# 3. Paper-based versus computer-based materials

It is widely accepted that language teachers need to be able to produce their own paper-based teaching materials when necessary. The advantages of such materials over o-the-shelf textbooks are well known, e.g. more suitable, more relevant, more up-to-date, less culturally biased, etc. That is why almost all teacher development courses include a module on materials development. This, however, does not mean that textbooks should be avoided, or that all teachers should produce some of their own materials. The knowledge of materials development enables teachers to become more critical in the selection of commercial textbooks and the ability to produce their own teaching materials gives them the freedom to mix o-the-shelf textbooks with do-it-yourself materials for the best and most suitable materials for a given group of learners in a particular context. The same reasoning, one would expect, should apply to computer-based materials. However, the common current practice in EFL teacher education in relation to IT restricts itself to the use of IT for delivering and using ready-made materials. Training language teachers to produce their own computer-based materials is still not as common as it should be.

# 4. Computer programming and language teachers' lack of con®dence

For several years, at the beginning of an M.Ed in Educational Technology and TESOL course at the University of Manchester, UK, where I used to work, I asked the students who were taking the CALL module how they felt about producing their own computer-based materials. The overwhelming majority always said that they would like to be able to do so. When I asked them whether they thought they would be good at producing their own computer-based materials the overwhelming majority usually said that they did not think so, or that they were doubtful. The main reasons they gave for this were, \`\`I don't know enough about computers'', \`\`I don't know how to program''. Interestingly, they did not say that they would not know what to produce even if they knew how to deal with the development and programming side. This is understandable because they were all experienced language teachers. When I asked them whether language teachers would make good computer programmers about $90 \%$ said that they did not think so. Now, these teachers normally have not done any kind of computer programming before. The question is why did they have such low con®dence in their ability, and that of language teachers in general, when it came to computer programming.

These days competent and professional language teachers are expected to have a wide range of knowledge and expertise. For instance, they need to know about, and have expertise in, teaching methodologies, linguistics, psychology, sociology, philosophy, cultural theories, management, and increasingly IT. It is almost taken for granted, by teachers and teacher educators, that language teachers can cope with these areas of knowledge and expertise. It may take time, but there is no question of them not being able to cope. The only exception, however, seems to be IT, especially computer programming. Why?

# 5. The image problem

Computers still suer from an image problem. This is mainly a legacy of their origin as number-crunching tools for scientists and mathematicians. Unfortunately, despite the popularity and widespread use of computers in an increasing number of areas of our daily lives, for many, including many language teachers, computers have not yet shed their mathematical, scienti®c, dicult-to-understand, hard-tocontrol, and male image. Programming too suers from the same, or even worse, image problem. The fact that programming has changed dramatically during the last

20 years and has become easier and more user-friendly has not changed that image. Programming, much more than computers, is still seen best left to \`computer scientists' or \`professional programmers', who, compared to mortal language teachers, are believed to be \`better at computers', \`better at maths', and generally \`more technically minded'.

However, these images of computers and programming are no longer true. Computers are no longer too dicult to make sense of; at least not more dicult than many other areas of knowledge with which language teachers are already coping without any major problems, e.g. psychology and sociology of language. Programming too has come a long way since the 1970s. Nowadays modern visual programming environments have turned programming into more of an art than mathematics. There is a vast library of commercial and non-commercial readymade code that can be readily used in one's program. It is no longer true that one has to be a computer scientist in order to be a good programmer.

# 6. Putting teachers in the driving seat

It seems that although more and more experienced teachers do use computers for word processing or running other types of commercial programs, including CALL programs and CD-ROMs, this does not give them the necessary con®dence when it comes to using computers because they still do not feel in control of the machine itself. It is dicult, I believe, to have a sense of control over computers without being able to program them in some way, in the same way that it would be dicult to have a sense of control over cars without being able to drive one. One could, of course, use a car without driving it; it could be driven by someone else, a professional driver perhaps. In this case one still does go from A to B, but this is not really having control over the car. Now, there are dierent degrees of control and dierent types of cars. Not many of us can drive a Formula One car the way a professional Formula One racing driver such as Damon Hill or Michael Schumacher can. No one, however, argues for leaving driving to professional drivers, who know more about cars, are more technically and mechanically minded, and can drive faster and better, etc. Most of us learn to drive and use that skill to meet our everyday needs. We still use public transport when necessary. The car, however, gives us the ¯exibility we increasingly need. Driving is perhaps a good example of a skill that despite its complexity, need for intensive training, and even risk to people's lives, has become recognised as necessary for modern life. Programming too, I would like to argue, is fast becoming a necessary and useful skill to have especially for educators.

# 7. Who's afraid of programming?

Unfortunately, on many post-experience teacher education courses, the dominant position is to \`shield' language teachers from programming as much as possible. In fact, usually a great eort is made, in the IT-related modules, not to use the term \`programming' if at all possible in order not to \`frighten' the teachers. So, instead of telling teachers that they are going to be introduced to programming so that they can get involved in producing their own computer-based materials, they are told that they should not be worried or afraid because the course would not involve any programming. The focus, therefore, stays on the evaluation and use of ready-made computer-based materials. Thus, once again, the misconceptions about computers and programming are reinforced and very little is done to help teachers to gain the necessary con®dence in their abilities to understand and control the computer. Considering that many of these teachers will in the future become teacher educators, it is not dicult to see the implications of such an approach for teacher education in general.

# 8. Teachers as end-user programmers

These days there is a strong movement in computer and information science communities towards opening up the world of programming to ordinary users of computers. This movement is usually known as \`end-user computing' or \`end-user programming' (e.g. Goodell, 1999, Nardi, 1993). It has been realised that users of computer packages, e.g. word processors, spreadsheets, authoring packages, know their problems best and have a detailed understanding of what they are trying to do. End-users have diverse needs and requirements that are not always possible to know in advance. To meet these needs, the end-users should have the possibility of adding to the package the necessary functions and capability as, and when, required. That is why many packages these days have their own programming language, e.g. Microsoft Oce has Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as its programming language. Programming, therefore, has become a public and generic skill which can be learned by end-users, including language teachers, who would need to program as a means to an end without necessarily being interested in computers and computer science per se.

# 9. Language teachers make better programmers

It has been argued (Nardi, 1993) that people usually do not have great diculty learning formal systems, especially when they are motivated and the systems are speci®c to tasks, e.g. numbers, alphabet, baseball or cricket scoring, knitting. Programming, therefore, as simply another formal system, should not be beyond anyone with sucient motivation, especially if the programming language is task speci®c, e.g. an authoring language. If so, language teachers, who know a lot about natural languages, the processes involved in learning them, and many of whom have actually learned at least one foreign language, are among the most suitable group of people to cope with modern computer programming. Language teachers know, among other things, about syntax and semantics, about rules and exceptions, about categories and properties, about the importance of the audience, about message and interpretation, about composition and revision, and about problem solving, all of which would be useful in learning a modern high level event-driven computer language. In fact it has even been argued that the teaching of computer programming at educational institutions should be taken away from maths teachers and given to language teachers instead (English and Edwards, 1984).

# 10. Conclusion

The language teaching profession needs its own IT professionals. We increasingly need quali®ed language teachers who at the same time are highly skilled in the relevant aspects of IT including design, development and programming of computerbased materials. We need to make IT our own; this would be, in many ways, different from the IT of computer science departments. So it does not matter that it \`\`takes as long to become a computer scientist as to qualify as a language teacher, and few people can hope to do both'' (Vincent, 1985, p. 80) because language teachers do not need to become computer scientists. We need to study IT, understand it, shed our fear of it, embed it within SLA (McLaughlin, 1987; Larsen-Freeman and Long, 1991; Ellis, 1994; Towell and Hawkins, 1994), and learning and instructional design theories (Child, 1986; McDonough, 1986; Brigge and Shermis, 1992; Hill, 1997; Seels and Glasgow, 1998; Smith and Ragan, 1999), then use it eectively for our pedagogic ends. Considering this and the rapid rate of change and growth in IT, it is becoming impossible to train the IT professionals we need without tailor-made MA courses that are dedicated to this task. This means that instead of MA courses that have only one or two modules related to IT, we increasingly need courses that are completely dedicated to various aspects of IT, including end-user programming, and instructional design for language teaching. Furthermore, such courses can act as fertile environments for the necessary research into the suitability and eectiveness of various techniques for teaching programming to language teachers. The time may come when no language teacher is afraid of computers or programming.
