This study explores the changes in perceptions of transitional challenges faced by learners studying Chemistry through English-medium instruction (EMI) at a university in Japan over one academic semester. The research investigates the relationship between students’ English proficiency, academic performance, and their perception of transitional challenges. The study involves 27 students from an introductory Chemistry course and adopts a mixed-methods approach. The quantitative analysis utilises IELTS scores, as well as preand post-content tests, to examine the relationship between language proficiency and academic performance. Complementing these findings, the qualitative analysis provides insights from semi-structured interviews conducted at the start and end of a 12-week semester. These interviews offer an in-depth look into the individual transition processes of six purposefully selected students who represent a range of backgrounds and varying degrees of success in EMI, including both international and local students. The findings indicate that English proficiency alone does not guarantee a successful transition into EMI. Other factors play crucial roles in the rate and extent to which students overcome transitional challenges. The study recognises the need for ongoing support to help students navigate persistent transitional challenges in EMI. Implications are discussed regarding language support, EMI curriculum planning, and future research directions.

# 1. Introduction

The globalisation of higher education has led to the rapid expansion of English Medium Instruction (EMI) programs, reflecting the prominent role of English as an international academic language. This trend is evident in Japan, where the Top Global University Project (TGUP), launched in 2014, has facilitated the introduction of EMI in participating universities (Aizawa and Rose, 2019). EMI is defined as “the use of the English language to teach academic subjects (other than English itself) in countries or jurisdictions where the first language of the majority of the population is not English” (Macaro, 2018, p. 19). Despite the continued growth of EMI, transitioning to EMI poses considerable challenges for students. Numerous studies have identified various challenges students face when learning content through EMI (Zhou & Thompson, 2023). Previous research suggests that English language proficiency plays a vital role in EMI success (Soruç, Altay, Curle, & Yuksel, 2021). However, other factors, such as prior EMI experience, motivation, self-efficacy, and learning strategies, are also crucial (Zhou & Rose, 2021). While the extensive body of research on EMI has significantly contributed to our understanding of the factors impacting the challenges students encounter, many studies have primarily adopted quantitative methods, offering a general overview of factors affecting success in EMI. These quantitative studies, frequently relying on mean comparisons, provide an indication of central tendency but may fall short in capturing the intricate and diverse learning experiences of individual students (Macaro, 2018). Such methods, while valuable, can overlook the nuanced and diverse experiences of students as they transition to and navigate through EMI, especially when these experiences are influenced by a complex interplay of numerous factors. Recognising these limitations, this study adopts a pre-post mixed-method approach spanning one semester to explore changes in perceptions of transitional challenges faced by learners beginning to study through EMI over time. It aims to capture not only the full spectrum of their experiences but also the temporal aspects of their transitional process. The findings of this study aim to offer implications for stakeholders involved in delivering EMI programs to better support students during their transition.

# 2. Background to the research

# 2.1. Transitional challenges in EMI

The transition into EMI poses a wide array of challenges for students (Macaro, Curle, Pun, An, & Dearden, 2018). In particular, language-related challenges are extensively documented in the literature as the most critical issues students encounter when transitioning into EMI (Aizawa and Rose, 2020). These challenges include comprehending lectures (listening); writing academic essays (writing); delivering presentations and participating in discussions (speaking); and understanding textbooks with unfamiliar vocabulary (reading). Research conducted in the context of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) has shown that students learning content through English also face general academic challenges, such as grasping academic concepts, adjusting to different educational cultures, and navigating new institutional conventions and norms (Evans & Morrison, 2011). Some studies, particularly those exploring the positive role of language support programs in EMI (e.g., EAP), indicate that these challenges can be largely mitigated over the course of one semester (e.g., Pessoa, Miller, & Kaufer, 2014). Supporting this, a longitudinal study conducted by Zhou et al. (2023) followed first-year Chinese students over their first semester of learning through EMI. Their study revealed that students improved their self-efficacy, and selfappraisals of success as the semester progressed. They also began to develop regulatory strategies, gaining a better understanding of listening to academic lectures and adjusting to more interactive teaching styles that characterise EMI.

However, much of the current research adopts a cross-sectional design, providing a snapshot of students’ experiences at a specific point in time. Concurring with calls for longitudinal studies to examine changes in EMI challenges (e.g., Evans & Morrison, 2011), the current study adopts pre-post design over one academic semester to explore the transitional challenges students face when learning Chemistry through EMI, specifically focusing on the interplay between English proficiency, prior EMI experience, and challenges. Through this approach, this study aims to offer insights into the multitude of factors that facilitate or hinder students’ success over time.

# 2.2. Factors influencing success in EMI

A wealth of research has been conducted to investigate the factors that contribute to success in EMI. The most frequently examined factor in the literature is English language proficiency, which is consistently found to be closely correlated with academic performance (Trenkic & Warmington, 2019). Numerous studies reaffirm that English proficiency is crucial for achieving success in EMI (Curle, Yuksel, Soruç, & Altay, 2020). However, recent research has begun to consider other variables, such as motivation (e.g., Kojima, 2021), emotions (Hillman, Li, Green-Eneix, & De Costa, 2023), learning strategies (Zhou & Rose, 2021), vocabulary (Uchihara & Harada, 2018), disciplinary literacy (Malmström & Pecorari, 2021), and prior educational experience (Aizawa and Rose, 2019). The emergence of these diverse areas of EMI research highlights the significance of the constellation of learner and contextual factors in determining success in EMI. For instance, a study by Kamasak, Sahan, and Rose (2021) demonstrated that prior exposure to EMI courses leads to improved academic outcomes. Highlighting the significance of prior EMI experience and educational culture, Aizawa and Rose, 2020 also found differences in vocabulary size and the magnitude of perceived challenges between students with JMI and EMI high school educational backgrounds. Galloway and Curle (2022) suggested that a student’s statusdwhether local or internationaldalso influences their academic performance, with international students potentially facing heightened challenges due to unfamiliarity with the local academic culture and norms. Aizawa, 2023 also revealed that academic performance could improve through institutional and language support, teacher assistance, and collaborative peer networks. Therefore, success in EMI is shaped by a combination of learner, institutional and classroom factors. This emphasises the need to focus on individual students from diverse profiles and backgrounds, and to consider other contextual factorsdsuch as support, resources, class sizes and group dynamicsdavailable to learners in EMI.

However, much of the existing literature has seemed to focus on the role of proficiency and other individual factors, with less attention being paid to the interplay among these factors. While some studies (e.g., Kamasak et al., 2021; Vidal & Jarvis, 2020) have offered context-specific descriptions to explore a multitude of factors, including motivation, self-efficacy, and other related factors in the context of EMI, the predominant use of quantitative methods in the field may not also fully capture the complexities and individual nuances of students’ learning trajectories. To fill these research gaps, the present study adopts a quantitative method to investigate the relationship between content test scores and proficiency, and, subsequently, uses follow-up pre-post interviews to explore how students overcome challenges over time. Given the gaps in the literature, this multi-dimensional research approach is necessary to fully capture the interplay of various factorsd including proficiency, prior EMI experience, student status (local or international), and prior knowledgedacross one semester, providing an indepth understanding of EMI transition.

# 2.3. Methodological limitations and gaps in research on EMI challenges

To address the limitations mentioned above, this current research uses a pre-post mixed-method approach spanning one academic semester to capture the individual experiences of students from diverse backgrounds and understand how their backgrounds intersect with proficiency and content test scores. It provides insights into how students navigate and potentially overcome their individual challenges over time, illuminating the individual variations that underpin success in EMI, which cannot be easily reduced to quantitative data. To summarise, this research fills the following methodological gaps in the literature. First, while there is a relative scarcity of studies that track students’ experiences over an extended period, the present study centres on a semester-long timeframe, with interviews held at both the beginning and end. Although it does not span multiple years or several data collection points, it addresses the lack of studies capturing students’ transition and success within a timeframe of a single semester. This study, thus, fills the gap concerning this temporal depth in the literature, as noted by Macaro et al. (2018). Second, much of the current research is skewed towards large-scale studies at the expense of smaller, context-specific examinations. While these large-scale studies provide general perspectives, they often fail to capture the unique experiences of individual students in specific contexts. This research emphasises these contextualised experiences through a focused, context-specific analysis. This approach seeks to illuminate the challenges and experiences students encounter in a particular educational setting, emphasising the importance of understanding students’ experiences within their unique educational contexts. Finally, there is a need for further research that explores the interplay between factors influencing student performance in EMI. Most studies have treated these factors in isolation, ignoring the potential interactions among them. Rather than considering these factors separately, this research, through its detailed case studies of individual students, seeks to unveil the complex constellation of factors that influence their EMI experiences, particularly when exploring different student profiles and backgrounds.

# 3. The study

The study addresses the following two research questions:

1. To what extent do differences exist in the post-test scores among students with varying levels of English language proficiency?   
2. How do the academic performance and perceptions of EMI-related challenges evolve over time (from the start of the semester to the end) for students with different levels of English language proficiency, and what factors might contribute to these changes?

# 3.1. Research contexts and participants

Considering the context-specific nature of EMI, a single case-study approach was employed to mitigate the potential effects of confounding variables tied to distinct contexts that could potentially impact students’ academic outcomes. The selected site for this research is a private university in Japan that is part of the TGUP initiative. The university under study is a private institution in Japan, admitting students biannually, in April and September. The student body comprises approximately $8 0 \%$ domestic and $2 0 \%$ international students. A distinctive feature of this university is its bilingual education model: students are required to complete at least $4 0 \%$ of their courses in English (EMI) to graduate, while still having the option to undertake courses in Japanese (JMI). This unique research context, with its blend of language options, offers a valuable context to explore students’ transition into EMI, in a setting where they are also exposed to instruction in Japanese. The selection of this particular university for the study is grounded in several reasons. Firstly, this university is a recipient of funding from the TGUP, aimed at promoting internationalisation. This has resulted in a uniform approach to EMI provision across various academic disciplines, making it a desirable research site for investigating the challenges and success factors of transitioning to EMI. Secondly, the selected course is undertaken by both domestic and international students. The variety in student backgrounds - such as differences in English proficiency, prior educational experiences, and first language - provides a rich array of perspectives and experiences with EMI. Thirdly, this research took place in a foundation course for first-year students. While it aims to minimise the influence of students’ prior content knowledge on their success, I recognise the heterogeneity within the student group. International students bring varied academic backgrounds, potentially affecting their transitional challenges in EMI. Therefore, this setting allows us to explore the complexities of transitional experiences in EMI, considering both prior content knowledge and language adjustments. Finally, all students attended the same lectures given by the same lecturer, thereby minimising the effect of different pedagogical approaches on success in EMI.

The study was conducted in an introductory Chemistry course comprising 70-min lectures, held twice a week for 12 weeks, totaling 21 classes. All students enrolled in the EMI module $\mathrm { . n } = 2 7 \cdot$ ) participated in the research at both Time 1 and

Time 2 (see the research procedure below). To recruit participants for interviews, the research adopted a multistage purposeful sampling strategy that allowed for the selection of information-rich cases based on a preconceived, initial set of criteria (Mills, Durepos, & Wiebe, 2010). This strategy, referred to as criterion-i sampling, is frequently employed in mixedmethods studies where the quantitative method either supplements the qualitative method or informs the sampling criteria of the qualitative method. In this case, six students were purposefully chosen to represent different cases to explore a range of variables, such as English language proficiency, previous educational backgrounds, and first languages. I also explored extreme or deviant cases (e.g., students with higher English proficiency but lower post-test scores) that illuminated both the unusual and typical experiences observed in the quantitative analysis. Demographic details of the participating students, such as gender, IELTS band score, and first language, are provided in Table 1. This diverse sample aimed to capture the broad range of experiences and challenges students encounter in EMI, thereby illuminating factors affecting success in EMI.

# 3.2. Data collection instruments and procedure

Before data collection began, participants were provided with consent forms detailing the research objectives and procedures. These forms highlighted their rights as participantsdincluding the freedom to withdraw at any stage of the study without repercussionsdand described the measures in place to ensure the confidentiality of their information. To avoid any coercion, participants were informed that their participation was voluntary and would not influence their course grades. The researcher addressed any questions or concerns about the consent form or study. Before the interviews, each participant was asked to sign the consent form. They were given ample time to review the consent forms, and the researcher was on hand to answer any questions or address uncertainties they might have had. To examine the challenges and successes students experienced in the course, this study collected students’ English proficiency, content test scores, and pre-post semi-structured interview data.

First, students’ English proficiency was measured using their IELTS band scores obtained at the time of their entry to the university. The scores ranged from 6.5 to 8.0, with a median of 7.0. This distribution placed most students within the B2 to C1 levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), suggesting that the majority of the participants were on the threshold of being independent users of English.

Second, students’ academic success in the Chemistry program was assessed using a content test developed by the content teacher of the EMI course. This study collected students’ pre-test scores to examine the baseline of their prior content knowledge. The pre-test was conducted during the first lecture of the semester (Week 1), and the post-test was administered during the last lecture (Week 12). Participants were allotted $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ to complete each test under the supervision of the researcher.

Finally, semi-structured interviews were conducted at two key points during the semester: at the beginning (two weeks after the course started) and at the end. This study selected six students using a multistage purposeful sampling strategy, and conducted interviews to explore their perceived challenges and successes experienced in the EMI Chemistry course. The interview schedule is provided in Appendix 1. These interviews were audio-recorded and subsequently transcribed for further analysis. The average length of each session was $2 6 . 8 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , with durations ranging from $1 4 \mathrm { m i n }$ to $3 6 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ (Mean 26.8; SD 6.4; Min 14; Max 36).

# 3.3. Data analysis

The first research question investigated the relationship between English language proficiency and content test outcomes. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the post-test scores and IELTS levels of participants. Although the interviews spanned from pre-course to post-course, the quantitative analyses focused solely on post-test scores. Subsequently, I categorised students into different proficiency groups based on their IELTS scores and generated a distribution of the post-test scores within each proficiency group. In addition, I examined the performance of students at the extremes of the post-test score distribution. For this, I identified the top and bottom $1 5 . 8 \%$ of students based on post-test scores and looked at the distribution of their English language proficiency. This analysis allowed me to examine whether high English proficiency consistently translated to high post-test scores.

Qualitative thematic analysis was applied to the interview data to identify recurring patterns and themes related to students’ experiences with transition challenges in EMI. The coding process combined deductive and inductive approaches, with preliminary themes being drawn from the literature and then refined based on the interview data. The final themes were organised into a coding scheme, which represented a range of experiences and perceived challenges in EMI (e.g., the speed of lectures, the diversity of academic topics and the complexity of academic concepts). A cross-case synthesis was performed to compare the experiences between different proficiency groups and across different IELTS levels. This facilitated a detailed exploration of the impact of language proficiency on students’ academic performance. The results from the content tests were also compared to the themes and patterns identified in the interview data, illuminating the relationship between students’ perceived challenges and actual test scores. Table 2 below presents a summary of data collection methods and analysis.

# 4. Results

In answering the first research question, the quantitative analysis explored the relationship between students’ English language proficiency and their post-test scores. The analysis was conducted on a sample of 27 EMI students, divided into groups according to their respective English language proficiency levels. Descriptive statistics in Table 3 below were calculated to explore how the EMI students’ post-test scores $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 2 7 $ ) varied according to each level of proficiency. Due to the small sample size of each proficiency group, the median and range were computed as a measure of central tendency in addition to the mean and standard deviation for each group. The mean and median scores for IELTS 6.5 were both 6.25 $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 2 5$ , range $= 2 . 5$ ); the scores for IELTS 7.0 were 5.75 and 6.25 $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 4 4$ , range $= 8 . 5$ ); the scores for IELTS 7.5 were 11.86 and 12.5 $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathsf { S } \mathrm { D } = 1 . 7 5$ , range $= 5 . 5$ ); the scores for IELTS 8.0 were 11.25 and 12.5 $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 9 1$ , range $= 1 0 . 5 \dot { }$ ); and the scores for L1 English were 12.04 and 13.5 $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 1 1$ , range $= 7 . 0$ ). The potential differences in the post-test scores according to each group indicate that students with higher proficiency, on average, appeared to achieve similar or higher test scores than their counterparts with lower proficiency. In particular, the L1 English students achieved the highest post-test scores $( \mathrm { M e a n } ~ = ~ 1 2 . 0 4 $ , Median $= 1 3 . 5$ ) among all the proficiency groups, suggesting that more linguistically advantaged L1 English students could possibly achieve higher scores than those who learned through L2 English.

Based on the three-sigma rule (Upton & Cook, 2014), post-test scores above 13.55 were in the top $1 5 . 8 \%$ , while scores below 7.25 fell into the bottom $8 4 . 2 \%$ . Interestingly, only those with an IELTS score of 8.0 or above were at the top end of the distribution (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Distribution of post-test scores by proficiency ${ \mathrm { ( n } } = 2 7 { \mathrm { ) } }$ ).

The descriptive statistics reveal patterns regarding the relationship between English proficiency and post-test scores. We observed that students with higher proficiency tended to achieve higher post-test scores than their peers with lower proficiency. However, the descriptive statistics also indicated that the test scores for some proficiency groups varied widely. This variation of scores means that the observed values within the groups were spread out, with some outliers that influenced the average values. For example, within the IELTS 8.0 group, the highest value was 15, and the lowest was 4.5, with a range of 10.5, a mean of 11.25, and a standard deviation of 3.91. The wide range of test scores in the IELTS 8.0 group included a minimum value that fell outside of three standard deviations of the mean. The presence of this outlier suggested that while the IELTS 8.0 group, on average, achieved higher test performance than their lower proficiency counterparts, some students in this proficiency group underperformed compared to their peers.

The quantitative findings in this study, based on descriptive statistics, play a crucial role in identifying unique cases of individual students that may deviate from the broader trends when solely relying on inferential statistics, which often involve comparing and contrasting group means. For instance, a closer inspection of the raw data revealed outliers: two students in the IELTS 7.0 category scored 1 and 4, respectively, and two students in the IELTS 8.0 category scored 4.5 and 7, respectively (see Figure 1 above). While these students were part of higher proficiency groups, these discrepancies indicate that these students did not perform as consistently as their peers within the same proficiency groups. This significant variation within the same groups suggests the importance of examining individual test scores. To explore the contributing factors of these particular cases, these outlier students were selected as case studies for further exploration through qualitative analysis. This triangulation of qualitative interviews thereby complements the quantitative findings, allowing us to holistically examine and unpack the underlying complexities that quantitative analysis alone could not fully capture. This methodological triangulation improves the study by presenting a more in-depth understanding of students’ experiences and performance in EMI contexts.

In answering the second research question, the interview analysis explores the experiences and challenges faced by students with different post-test scores as well as the two extreme cases of students within the same proficiency groups. By juxtaposing these individual narratives with broader trends identified through the quantitative data, the interviews unpack the process of students overcoming transitional challenges. Over the course of a semester, this study tracked the following six students, each providing a unique perspective due to their varied proficiency levels, EMI experiences, and other demographic backgrounds (see Table 4).

Emmy, an L1 English speaker, offers insight into the experiences of those who might not struggle with language proficiency but still need to adjust to the EMI setting. Miki, with prior EMI experience, helps us understand how earlier exposure to EMI influences subsequent performance and transition. Rui allows us to examine the challenges faced by students with lower proficiency levels. In contrast, Sophia offers insight into the experiences of international students transitioning into the EMI environment. Mari and Luna represent students who, despite their higher proficiency, did not perform as well as expected on the post-tests. By focusing on these two students, we can explore other factors beyond language proficiency that might impact success in EMI. The subsequent qualitative analysis of their experiences illuminates how various factors intersect to shape success in EMI, thereby elaborating on why students with the same English proficiency level might exhibit differences in academic performance and perceive EMI challenges differently.

# 4.1. Magnitude and types of adjustment challenges

# 4.1.1. Emmy and Miki

The initial interviews at the start of the semester illuminated the various challenges each student faced while adjusting to their EMI courses. Emmy and Miki, both with higher English proficiency and, in Miki’s case, prior EMI experience, seemed to navigate the initial challenges with greater ease. Emmy noted, “At first, the different accents and the speed of the lectures were difficult for me. But as time goes on, I find it easier to understand.” Emmy’s initial difficulties, such as adjusting to different accents and the pace and structure of lectures, were challenges that were largely mitigated by the end of the second week of the semester. However, she also stated, “What stays difficult, though, is understanding some academic words and norms that are new to me.” This suggests that understanding new academic conventions and technical vocabulary were elements outside her immediate control.

In Miki’s case, with her prior EMI experience, she was also able to quickly adapt. Miki stated, “I’ve had experience with EMI before, so I’m able to handle many of the problems quickly.” Yet, she also acknowledged, “Getting used to the new teaching styles, the pace of the coursework, and really grasping the complex academic concepts has taken a bit more time for me.” This indicates that adapting to specific teaching styles, the pace of the course, and mastering complex academic concepts required a more long-term adjustment period for her.

Their post-test scoresd15 for Miki and 12.5 for Emmydfurther support these findings, suggesting that they successfully navigated their EMI transition. This success can be attributed, in large part, to their strong foundation in the English language. In Miki’s case, her previous EMI experience played a crucial role in her ability to adapt to the demands of the EMI course.

# 4.1.2. Rui

In contrast, Rui, with lower English proficiency and no prior EMI experience, faced greater challenges at the start of the semester. From her own account, Rui explained, “I’m not good at English, so I’m having a hard time improving my English. Learning new academic words, and understanding instructions in English has been difficult for me.” For Rui, challenges, including familiarising herself with technical words, and understanding textbooks and lectures in English, were difficult to overcome. Despite her consistent effort and proactive approachdseeking support from her teacher and engaging with her coursematesdRui was unable to fully overcome many of the challenges. These included the pace at which new material was covered in her classes, her confidence in oral interactions (e.g., class discussions and group work), and her ability to produce clear and coherent written assignments. These challenges were reflected in her relatively low post-test score of 6.5. By the end of the second week, she could foresee potential challenges, stating, “I also feel overwhelmed trying to balance learning English with understanding the course content, and by the end of the second week, it was clear that this was going to be a significant problem for me.”

Furthermore, time management emerged as a notable challenge for Rui. Balancing intensive English language learning with mastering the subject matter of her course in English proved to be a considerable strain. Additionally, Rui highlighted another layer of challenges which she was not initially prepared for, as she revealed, “Adapting to a new way of learning and interacting in seminars, which is very different from what I am used to in high school, has added another layer of challenges.” These cultural differences, along with the unfamiliar educational cultures, such as more interactive class dynamics and independent learning environments, made her initial transition particularly challenging.

# 4.1.3. Sophia

International student Sophia encountered challenges that extended beyond language proficiency or prior EMI experience. Sophia shared, “For me, the language-related challenges became easier over time. But understanding the new academic, institutional, and cultural environment is more complex, and it takes me a long time.” Although she demonstrated a gradual improvement in managing language-related challenges, her case reveals that language issues were just the tip of the iceberg. Understanding the new academic, institutional, and cultural norms posed a more complex and long-term challenge. She found it difficult to adjust to new styles of teaching and assessment, unfamiliar classroom norms, and different expectations of student participation and classroom engagement.

In addition, Sophia struggled to navigate the administrative aspects of her education, such as course registration processes, understanding grading systems, and meeting specific departmental requirements, which were different from those in her home country. Sophia’s transition was also influenced by her process of cultural acculturation. As Sophia stated, “[Transition] is more than just language. It’s learning a whole new way of being a student.” As an international student, she faced the additional burden of adjusting to a new social and cultural environment while simultaneously adapting to her new academic program. She confessed, “And beyond the classroom, adjusting to life in a new country, from social norms to daily routines, has been an equally significant challenge.” Dealing with feelings of isolation and homesickness, understanding informal language and social cues outside the classroom, and building a new social support network all contributed to her academic performance and perceptions of ease towards EMI study.

Sophia also discussed the speed of her transitional process, mentioning, “I can’t control how fast I get used to the new culture and education system.” The speed of her cultural acculturation and the expectations of the new education system were elements beyond her immediate control. Despite these multifaceted challenges, Sophia made some positive progress by the end of the second week, as indicated by her post-test score of 8.5.

# 4.1.4. Mari and Luna

Interestingly, Mari and Luna, despite their relatively high English proficiency, demonstrated unexpectedly low post-test scores compared to their peers who had achieved similar proficiency levels. Mari admitted, “Although I know English well, the transition to an EMI course has been challenging. I have trouble getting used to the speed of the lectures, some of the topics, and the complex concepts. It feels like those things are beyond my control.” Similarly, Luna expressed, “It isn’t only about knowing English well. The real challenges for me are understanding the concepts of Chemistry and keeping up with the pace of lectures. Those are the things I still struggle with as I go through the second week.”

Their experiences show that despite similar language proficiency, managing the transition into an EMI course can be a significant challenge. While they faced fewer language-related issues (e.g., understanding textbooks, engaging in discussions in English), factors such as the speed of lectures, the diversity of academic topics introduced in the module, and the complexity of academic concepts and prior experience of learning Chemistry might be less within their control to mitigate. Their challenges, revealed through lower gain scores (Mari’s was 1, and Luna’s was 3), suggest a complex interplay of contextual and learner factors, not just English proficiency, could be influencing student performance. By the end of the second week of the semester, both Mari and Luna were still struggling to fully transition into EMI.

Overall, the initial interviews highlighted the diverse challenges students face when adjusting to EMI courses. Mari and Luna’s experiences show that managing the transition into the EMI course involves more than language proficiency alone. Beyond the basic ability to understand textbooks and engage in discussions in English, various other factors played a significant role in their performance. For instance, the speed and delivery style of the lectures were challenging for them, despite their initial English language proficiency. The diversity of academic topics introduced in the module and the complex, domain-specific vocabulary associated with these topics presented another layer of challenges. Moreover, their prior experience and familiarity with learning Chemistry were influential. For students new to the discipline, the complexity of academic concepts can be daunting, regardless of their language proficiency. Mari and Luna’s familiarity with various teaching and assessment methods, which might differ substantially from those they experienced in their pre-university education, also seems to impact their transition into EMI. Thus, their challenges suggest a complex interplay of contextual, learner, and social factorsdnot just English proficiencydthat could influence student performance in EMI.

# 4.2. Duration and speed of adjustment challenges

The in-depth exploration of the semester-end interviews highlighted not only the varying speeds at which students adjusted to their EMI course but also how their experiences compared and contrasted. For some, adjusting to the EMI course was not a short-term challenge but a longer-term process that extended throughout the semester.

# 4.2.1. Emmy and Miki

Emmy and Miki, who began the semester with higher English proficiency and some degree of familiarity with EMI education, exhibited a quicker pace of adjustment. For Emmy, being an L1 English speaker was an advantage that eased her linguistic challenges. As she mentioned, “Being a native speaker of English helped at the start, but getting used to the way things are done here was tough.” This higher proficiency allowed her to focus more on acclimatising to the academic environment, including adapting to the specific academic conventions of her institution, such as expectations for class participation, written assignments, and exam formats. However, Emmy also found that being an L1 English speaker did not necessarily prepare her for the use of technical language used in Chemistry. She highlighted, “Understanding and applying the technical language in equations and formulas for Chemistry calculations has been tough. It’s a completely different set of challenges.” She had to adapt to the diverse expectations of various professors, each with their unique teaching and grading styles.

Similarly, Miki’s previous EMI experience appeared to serve as a strong foundation, easing her transition to the EMI course. Reflecting on her transition, Miki shared, “I’ve studied Chemistry in English before, so I wasn’t starting from zero. I knew a bit about what to expect, which made things easier for me.” She was already accustomed to the format and expectations of EMI courses and came prepared with strategies to navigate linguistic challenges. However, Miki also faced challenges related to the course content and teaching styles. Reiterating these challenges, she stated, “But getting used to different teaching styles and managing the demanding workload were challenging.” Different professors had different expectations, and she found that it took time to adapt to each professor’s style of teaching and grading criteria. Additionally, Miki claimed, “I had to learn to manage my time and stress effectively” reporting time management as an ongoing challenge, as the workload in her EMI course was heavy and demanded strong organisational skills.

Thus, for both students, their adjustment to EMI was more than a linguistic transition; it was also a process of acculturation into a new academic community, which includes understanding and adapting to new social and academic norms, irrespective of their English proficiency or previous exposure to EMI.

# 4.2.2. Rui

With limited English skills and a lack of previous EMI exposure, Rui’s transition proved to be more taxing in comparison. As she admitted, “The whole thing was really hard for me. I was still having trouble with the language by the end of the semester.” Even with the unwavering support of her peers, which she acknowledges by stating, “Thanks to my friends, I think I’m getting better,” Rui’s progression remained measured. Although she felt that she made progress in her academic language skills, she was still grappling with substantial linguistic challenges at the end of the semester. Thus, her experience emphasises that for students starting with lower English proficiency, adjustment to EMI can be a persistent struggle that spans the entire course, and not just initial challenges to overcome.

# 4.2.3. Sophia

Sophia’s EMI experience, as an international student, presented unique challenges. Although her English test score was sufficient for EMI, she had to navigate challenges related to academic, institutional, and cultural transition, including the interaction with course members and different class sizes. As she described, “My problems weren’t just about language or Chemistry, but also about getting used to life in Japan.” The process of assimilating into a different culture and educational system exacerbated her adjustment difficulties and consequently lengthened the duration of her transitional challenges. By the end of the semester, although there was a noticeable improvement in her post-test scores, Sophia confessed, “I was still trying to adjust even at the end of the semester, with so many different things to get used to.” She was still grappling with these cultural, institutional, and academic differences. Her case thus demonstrates that international students may continue adjusting beyond a single semester, due to the additional complexities of cultural assimilation and understanding differing educational systems.

# 4.2.4. Mari and Luna

Interestingly, the cases of Mari and Luna highlighted the disconnect between language proficiency and the speed or success of adjustment. Despite their moderate to high proficiency, their transition was not smooth. Mari reflected on this, stating, “Even though I know English, I didn’t do well. My mark didn’t reflect how well I know English, which made me realise that doing well in EMI isn’t just about knowing the language.” This experience was echoed by Luna, who noted, “I thought knowing English would make things easy in EMI, but the course was more intense than I thought.” Even by the end of the semester, their performance, as indicated by their post-test scores, had not significantly improved, suggesting that their struggles were deeply rooted in issues beyond language proficiency.

Luna further clarified this, pointing out, “I think the biggest problem for me was the lack of previous experience of learning Chemistry at school.” This highlights how prior knowledge in a particular subject can significantly influence EMI transition. Mari added that her challenges were long-lasting rather than short-term teething problems, admitting, “I should have studied harder before the final exam. It’s a challenge that lasts longer than just a few starting issues.”

Potential factors may also include their learning strategies, time management skills, and general adjustment to the university environment, which encompasses a new level of autonomy in learning, different expectations for student engagement, and the pressure to balance academic responsibilities with personal and social life. The comparison between these two students and the rest of the group emphasised that a high level of English proficiency does not necessarily guarantee a prompt and effective adjustment to the EMI course. This suggests that their challenges were not merely short-lived ‘teething’ issues but rather long-lasting challenges that they needed to continually navigate. Their experiences emphasise that while language proficiency plays a pivotal role, other factors such as motivation, prior knowledge of the subject, learning strategies, and selfstudy habits can also impact their transition and overall performance.

Overall, these findings illustrate the multifaceted nature of students’ transition into EMI. Despite similar English proficiency levels, students demonstrated varying test scores and rates of adjustment. This diversity is attributed to several interconnected factors. English proficiency, while a strong foundation, is not the sole predictor of a smooth transition; even high-proficiency students may struggle with the academic language and technical terms used in Chemistry. Prior experience with EMI often eases new transitions, as students are already familiar with the instructional style and expectations. Academic preparedness, or students’ familiarity with the subject matter and previous educational background, also seem to significantly affect their transition. Cultural acclimatisation also plays a role, especially for international students or those unfamiliar with the educational norms of the institution. Finally, the presence of informal support, such as mentorship from professors and interaction with peers, is crucial in students’ transitions into EMI. These findings emphasise that the transition into EMI is a complex, individualised process, with challenges that may persist for varying durations across different students.

# 5. Discussion

The examination of the challenges faced by students in the EMI Chemistry course revealed significant variations in the duration of adjustment for the students. This finding echoes the studies of Evans and Morrison (2011), which similarly highlighted the heterogeneity of learner experiences in EMI settings. This study draws attention to outliers, particularly Mari and Luna, who, despite their moderate to high English proficiency, struggled to learn Chemistry in English. This finding underpins the complexity of learner and classroom-based factors that affect the learning experience in EMI and aligns with previous research by Kamas¸ ak and Sahan (2023), suggesting that English proficiency, while important, is not the sole determinant of success in EMI. Their challenges serve as a potent reminder of the need to consider a broader range of factors, including L2 proficiency, prior exposure to EMI, prior content knowledge, and learning strategies in the adjustment process, which can significantly influence student performance in EMI. Specifically, echoing the findings of Galloway and Curle (2022), Sophia, an international student in this study, faced additional challenges in cultural, social, and academic acculturation, which were central to the root causes of her challenges in EMI. In addition to these learner factors, Doiz and Lasagabaster (2018: 673) also found that classroom-based factors, such as a “smaller size of the groups” and “rapport and dynamics within the group”, also created a safe and positive learning environment. These positive classroom-based factors (e.g., peer support and group size) were also found to be significant in the current study, as noted by Rui and Sophia. Despite the consensus in the literature on the role of these factors, the current study nuances this understanding by stressing the varied duration and types of challenges faced by each studentdwhether related to proficiency, cultural acculturation, or understanding complex academic conceptsdand the differential impacts these have on the duration of their adjustment process. Moving beyond solely emphasising language proficiency, this study, therefore, explores the multifaceted nature of EMI challenges, highlighting the importance of additional influencing factors, as found in previous studies in Japan (Rose et al., 2019) that examined the role of motivation, self-efficacy, L2 proficiency and content learning outcomes in EMI.

The pre-post design of this study sets it apart from many of the existing studies examining EMI challenges, which, as pointed out by Pessoa, et al. (2014), often adopt a cross-sectional approach, providing only a snapshot of student experiences at a particular point in time. Following Evans and Morrison’s (2011) call for more longitudinal work, this study spans an entire semester, providing a more in-depth perspective on the students’ experience. This approach, consistent with the methodological preferences of Dafouz, Camacho-Miñano, (2016); Doiz, and Lasagabaster (2018), allows for a richer understanding of how students navigate through and potentially overcome their challenges over time. Accordingly, the semester-spanning prepost design fills a specific methodological gap, offering a focused temporal lens on the transitional challenges and adaptations of EMI students. Interestingly, the current findings provide a mixed perspective, contrasting with Zhou and Thompson’s (2023) work by illustrating both the aspects of the transition that students can mitigate and those they cannot. While some challengesdsuch as adjusting to different accents, learning new academic vocabulary, and becoming comfortable with the pace and structure of lecturesdwere largely mitigated by students by the end of the semester, more persistent challenges emerged. Echoing the findings of Evans and Morrison (2011), this study found that, regardless of students’ backgrounds, understanding new academic conventions, adapting to specific teaching styles, and mastering complex academic content presented enduring difficulties requiring extended adjustment periods.

Despite a semester-long engagement with their EMI course, some students, such as Luna and Rui, were still grappling with these challenges. The data suggest that these students’ struggles could be attributed to their relative unfamiliarity with the EMI environment, differences in educational cultures, and their lower initial English proficiency, respectivelyda finding that aligns with those of Kamasak et al. (2021). These challenges highlight the complexity and potentially time-consuming nature of transitioning into EMI, which depends on a combination of several factors, including academic background, as suggested by Trenkic and Warmington (2019). The current study, therefore, suggests the need for further longitudinal studies, aligning with the assertions of Macaro et al. (2018), to capture the temporal aspects of students’ transitional challenges in EMI courses. The recognition of the factors that students can or cannot mitigate will facilitate the design of more effective support programs to facilitate their transition into EMI, as proposed by Pessoa, et al. (2014). Considering the potentially significant duration of this transition, as noted by Galloway and Rose (2021), this study urges the necessity of providing sustained support to students throughout their EMI transition.

Methodologically, the current study addresses a pertinent gap in the literature by transcending statistical analyses that rely heavily on the comparison of means. As pointed out by Macaro (2018), such methods may inadvertently conceal the diversity and complexity of individual student experiences in EMI settings. In response to this limitation, this study incorporates qualitative analysis, resonating with recent calls for more holistic and comprehensive research approaches in the field (Galloway, Numajiri, & Rees, 2020). This qualitative approach enables us to unpack narratives and subjective experiences, detailing why different students, even those with a similar level of English proficiency, may grapple with distinct sets of challenges. As such, this study foregrounds individual voices and personal trajectories in EMI, revealing nuanced layers of the learning experience often obscured by quantitative data. Therefore, the focus of the current study on smaller, context-specific examinations has distinguished itself from the bulk of other large-scale studies that primarily provide broader patterns but may neglect the granular, nuanced experiences of individual students.

In conclusion, the current study, rooted in a semester-long pre-post design, offers a refined understanding of students’ experiences in EMI, which is of paramount importance for the development of effective pedagogical practices, the design of tailored instructional materials, and the provision of targeted student support in EMI contexts. The insights derived from this study hence contribute significantly to the evolving discussion on methodologies used in EMI research.

# 6. Implications and limitations

Drawing from the current research, several key pedagogical implications emerge for the design and delivery of EMI courses. Firstly, the varied duration of students’ adjustment processes suggests that language support in EMI settings should be tailored and ongoing. As suggested by Galloway and Rose (2021), language support should not be a one-size-fits-all approach but should consider the different language proficiency levels and specific linguistic challenges each student faces. English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP), focusing on the specific needs of learners in relation to their chosen academic subjects, can offer a personalised approach to language support that is specific to the discipline. This could be achieved through personalised language workshops, supplementary tutoring, and continuous linguistic scaffolding throughout the semester, all aimed at meeting the evolving needs of students within their specific fields of study. Secondly, the cases of Mari and Luna, in line with the findings by Curle et al. (2020), emphasise that English proficiency alone does not determine success in EMI. Other factors, such as prior EMI exposure, group dynamics, peer support, familiarity with academic conventions, and the ability to apply effective learning strategies, play a significant role. Thus, content teachers should implement differentiated instruction and adopt inclusive practices to cater to these diverse student experiences. By focusing on discipline-specific language and skills, ESAP can help strengthen these positive learner factors, increasing their chances of success in EMI contexts. Additionally, considering the multifaceted determinants of success in EMI, as previously stated, the current findings recommend the introduction of mentorship programs, workshops focusing on academic expectations, and seminars highlighting discipline-focused study methodologies, all ensuring a holistic approach to student support beyond mere language proficiency. Thirdly, the study reveals the importance of cultural and academic orientation in EMI. The transition to a new academic system, particularly one in a different language and in a foreign country, can be overwhelming for international students. Therefore, different support programs for home and international students, as recommended by Galloway and Curle (2022), can help students familiarise themselves with new academic conventions and teaching styles, easing the transition process. Here, undertaking ESAP courses can be of great benefit to international students. The focus of ESAP on the specific language needs within a particular academic or professional field can assist in better navigating cultural and academic orientations in EMI. Fourthly, the diversity in student backgrounds, skills, and experiences can be harnessed positively through collaborative learning. Peer-learning activities, as supported by Aizawa, 2023, allow students to learn from each other’s strengths, enabling a balanced learning environment and reducing the pressure on those struggling with language proficiency. Lastly, the current findings, consistent with Evans and Morrison’s (2011) emphasis on pre-post longitudinal studies, suggest that adjustment to EMI is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. Sustained support should be offered in the form of ESAP courses, which can provide students with the opportunity to continuously work on and improve their discipline-specific language skills, such as the technical terms specific to Chemistry.

In EMI contexts, the importance of continuous monitoring and timely support plans is paramount. As reported in Doiz and Lasagabaster’s (2018; 674) study in Spain, timely and appropriate linguistic support, based on “teachers’ awareness of the students’ gaps in English” within EMI courses, can significantly influence students’ learning experiences. Consistent with the importance of “discipline-specific support” through support schemes, such as ESAP programs (Galloway & Rose, 2022), the current study found that students grapple with technical language, including scientific terms used in equations and formulae. As such, offering ESAP can directly assist students in addressing the immediate linguistic challenges they face, especially those specific to studying Chemistry. Furthermore, regular check-ins may also be introduced in the form of in-sessional courses (see Macaro, 2018, for types of support models), where ESAP teachers can maintain consistent contact with students, providing language support courses throughout the academic semester. As Evans and Morrison (2011) advocated, continuous feedback and assurance of sustained support can help ensure that students’ evolving needs are met during their EMI transition, particularly in their pivotal first year, as explored in this study. In response, Galloway and Rose (2021) note that language support can be reduced over time as students progress in their EMI degree studies. Thus, integrating ESAP can improve student support by delivering targeted language assistance tailored to students’ ongoing academic language requirements in EMI. In essence, these findings align with Galloway and Rose’s (2022) assertion about the importance of greater collaboration between ELT practitioners and content instructors in EMI settings. Such an approach recognises and responds to the diverse experiences of students and the multifaceted nature of their transition process.

However, the current study is not without its limitations. Firstly, the research was conducted over a single semester, a duration that might be insufficient to grasp the long-term implications of EMI on student experiences and academic success. Moreover, the pre-test scores were not controlled for, which might not account for their potential influence on post-test outcomes. This raises concerns about the possible impact of students’ prior content knowledge on their learning experiences and subsequent post-test results. Future studies might wish to consider extending the duration to achieve a more comprehensive understanding. Secondly, the small sample size of the study, while allowing us to examine individual experiences, limits the generalisability of the current findings. Thirdly, the absence of a non-EMI comparison group limits the ability to definitively attribute student challenges to the EMI environment. Future research may benefit from a comparative study design examining student experiences in both EMI and non-EMI settings (Macaro, 2018). Finally, an essential factor to consider in EMI is the role of the academic discipline under study. Different disciplines come with unique challenges. Students learning Chemistry grapple with complex scientific concepts and encounter a discipline-specific vocabulary that may be unfamiliar. Terms, symbols, formulae, and diagrams used in Chemistry may create added layers of challenges for EMI students. As a result, while the findings of this study are illuminating for the context of Chemistry, the challenges and successes experienced by students could differ if they were studying other disciplines in EMI. Thus, future research may address these limitations by expanding the sample size across various academic disciplines and EMI and ESAP contexts, incorporating other forms of data collection to supplement small sample sizes, implementing comparative study designs, and extending the research timeframe. These considerations could enhance our understanding of student experiences in EMI, thereby improving the design and implementation of EMI courses.

# 7. Conclusion

In conclusion, this study has shed valuable light on the diverse challenges facing learners beginning to study Chemistry through EMI. The findings underscore that the process of adjustment to EMI is a complex, multifaceted challenge, influenced by various factors, including proficiency, prior exposure to EMI, learning strategies, and prior knowledge. The study has highlighted the significant variations in the duration of adjustment, with some students adapting with great ease and in a relatively short period of time, while others continue to grapple consistently with challenges throughout the semester. This study represents a significant advancement in our understanding of student transitional challenges in EMI. It provides a strong foundation for future research aimed at enhancing long-term student outcomes and the overall experience in EMI.
