# Abstract

This article reports on the findings of a survey on Genre Analysis [Swales, J. (1990, 1992, 1993). Genre analysis - English in academic and research settings. Cambridge: CUP (Reprinting 1991); Swales, J. (1992). Re-thinking genre: another look at discourse community effects. Ottawa: Carleton University. (Mimeo); Swales, J. (1993). Genre and engagement. Revue Belge de Philogie et d'Histoire, 71, 687-698.] of 117 commercial letters in English exchanged by fax between a Brazilian company and two European companies. These letters were analysed in terms of shared communicative purposes and rhetorical features which together contribute to the building-up of the resulting generic structure named as Business Letters of Negotiation (LN). All Moves and Steps will be presented here and discussed with examples of the most frequent linguistic signals which characterize them. A brief discussion on these categories, and teaching implications follow these findings. Published on behalf of The American University by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

# 1. Introduction

The research described in this article has its roots in my own experience as an EFL teacher which has shown that mainstream commercial English text-books, adopted by many language schools in Brazil, fail to give thorough descriptions of social and cultural aspects. Consequently, pupils always ask me to complement their lessons with what they call "routine issues" such as: cultural aspects, attitudes of behavior, adequacy of lexico-gramatical choices and so on. These issues seem to be of relevance when these non-native adult-students need to relate to and exchange ideas with native speakers or foreigners, and especially when they need to show competence in the English language (Santos, 1994a).

Worldwide, studies in ESL and ESP support and illustrate similar worries, and give evidence that more and more teachers and researchers are taking advantage of investigations on both cross-cultural differences and genre analysis to develop materials on business English for specialists. In 1986, for example, Neu developed a study which focused on oral American-English cross-cultural negotiations in order to bring about "cultural and linguistic patterns which are not always shared' (p. 42) and to be able to \*talk about materials and methods which will more accurately meet the needs of non-native negotiators in American English" (p. 46). As a result of this investigation, Neu claims that "Negotiations can be optimally successful only when all participants are well-informed and understanding of each others' cultures and attitudes towards negotiations."' (p. 55-56). Jenkins and Hinds (1987) analysed business letters from three different cultures: American-English, French and Japanese and, similarly to Neu, concluded that "it is essential that they [students] be made aware of the differences which exist in business writing across cultures"' (p. 343).

Literature on oral and written investigations with authentic materials on crosscultural business interactions, either oral or written, show that teaching and learning situations have not changed so much since the end of the 1980s. To name a few: Maier (1992) compared business letters written by native and non-native professionals from the point of view of politeness strategies and showed weaknesses on the part of NNS using oral data. Garcez (1993) developed an ethnographic microanalysis of a cross-cultural business interaction and discussed differences in pointmaking between Americans and Brazilians; also focusing on the pragmatic meanings of language organization in terms of power display, power sharing and tactical deference. Lampi (1993) analysed oral exchanges between Buyer and Seller to show the importance of teaching "meaningful language in a meaningful context"' (p. 167). Ma (1993) aiming at "a foundation for syllabus design or evaluation of course' (p. 281) developed a corpus study of genre with genuine direct sales letters; also based on genre analysis. Bhatia (1993b) presented and discussed the results of a description of language in use based on authentic written promotional materials, and called attention to the importance of "genre construction and its subsequent use in professional settings' (p. 134).

This increasing interest in Business English in use for foreign and second laguage learners has been more recently discussed by St. John (1996). In her review she asks for more effective interdisciplinary research (p. 8) on the nature of this discourse, including language, cultural patterns, the influence of technological apparatus, and the institutional context itself because "There is a definite need to understand more of the generic features of different events such as meetings, to identify common features of effective communications, to understand the role of cultural influences and the ways in which language and business strategies interact' (p. 15). Or further, as Gunnarson (1997) claims, referring to the writing mode, "Writing in an organization is not only a matter of knowing how to write a certain document for a specific audience but also a matter of how to fit into the organizational structure and how to adapt to the organizational subculture and its norms, attitudes and values" (p. 41).

Almost as a reaction to this claim for an interdisciplinary approach, Barbara, Celani, Collins and Scott (1996), Charles (1996), Eustace (1996), Gunnarson (1997),

Louhiala-Salminen (1996, 2002), and Nickerson (1998) have sought to establish the influence of recent communication mediums and the language in practice on corporate culture. Barbara et al. (1996) carried out a survey of Brazilian organizations and their specific needs and individual differences in terms of types of communication and communications needs. Louhiala-Salminen (1996), by means of questionnaires and interviews dealt with the influence of technological advances on written language command and effectiveness, and reported on the recent views of business professionals in Finland and aspects of written communication in English, such as organization, structure and language; her findings are supported by Eustace's (1996) short communication about written communication in English in the UK; Charles (formerly Lampi; 1996) using audio-recorded British negotiations, compared extralinguistic features in oral exchanges, such as status-behaviour and the market situation, with linguistic production -- having old and new relationships as a variable for status in order to set the relationship between business context reality and its linguistic production. Gunnarson's study provided data about the social dimensions of writing at work. Using questionnaires and interviews she provides information that ranges from organization structure and its effects on writing to the process of document construction and communication development at a local government office. Nickerson (1998) also using questionnaires analysed the impact of corporate culture on non-native written communication among British subsidiary companies in the Netherlands, and Louhiala-Salminen (2002) seeking meaningful data for pedagogical practices as well as testing research methodology, reported on a pilot case study in Finland which observed the discourse activites of a business manager for one whole working day. All the findings support St. John's (1996) recommendation of a broader "approach that draws on techniques from fields such as applied linguistics, corpus linguistics and social sciences.'' (p. 8).

In the Brazilian situation, investigations within the DIRECT Project', have yielded interesting results which have been helping researchers and teachers at PUC to improve materials and courses both in oral and written productions for ESL and ESP. The present study will, more specifically, focus on business written production since one of the main problems among business professionals is writing letters in English. My professional observations as a teacher together with my worries about socio-cultural issues and adequate language choices led me to carry out an investigation2 on language usage based on the analysis of authentic texts. My main objective was to find out about how communicative purposes are achieved through language realizations using current and authentic written data. The corpus researched was commercial letters produced by Brazilian Speakers of English as a Foreign Language and their foreign counterparts; the analytical approach chosen was that of genre (Swales, 1990, 1992, 1993; Bhatia, 1992, 1993a,b). The resulting genre framework was identified according to the following procedures:

1. the communicative purpose, that generates the written production; and   
2. the discourse community, that shares motivation, content and style.

In this article I will be:

3. presenting the findings of this genre analysis in terms of structure; 4. discussing briefly the lexico-gramatical choices which characterize each identified rhetorical function.

# 2. The concept of genre analysis

I am following Swales' (1990) definition of genre in which members of a specific discourse community share "structure, style, content, and intended audience  (p. 58) in order to express their communicative purposes (p. 10). Swales' definition can work as a reliable pedagogical rhetorical-functional framework for the beginnerstudent as well as for the student with difficulties in order to understand and become aware of text characteristics shared by members within a discourse community, who are already making use of it.

# 3. Corpus and method of analysis

One hundred and seventeen letters transmitted by fax between a Brazilian veterinary-pharmaceutical company and two European companies were chosen and analysed in terms of their rhetorical features. For analytical purposes these companies were re-named, to preserve confidentiality, and numbered according to:

1. country of origin, when the letter is sent from Europe because the destination is always Brazil;   
2. country of origin and destination when the letter is sent from Brazil because there are two possibilities: Holland and Great Britain; and   
3. date of issue.

Therefore, the acronym BRASHOLL identifies Brazil and Holland, BRASBRIT identifies Brazil and Britain, and HOLLVET and BRITVET identify Holland and Britain, respectively - the word VET stands for Veterinary. The resulting absolute distribution of the corpus is the following:

BRASBRIT: 07   
BRITVET: 17   
BRASHOLL: 39   
HOLLVET: 54   
Total: 117

The first analytical procedure was to study each letter separately trying to identify the rhetorical functions present in the communicative event. The second step was to compare these individual results within the whole corpus aiming at drawing common characteristics which could be recognized as typical of this genre. The language patterns identified were classified according to the intended rhetorical function. Formal aspects and structural features were also observed in terms of content, intention and function (see Paltridge, 1994; Bhatia, 1993a; Thompson, 1994). The main communicative purpose together with content, intention and function, guided the division of this genre into moves and steps. The sequences of rhetorical functions and linguistic signals were also surveyed, but for practical reasons linguistic signals will be dealt with in depth in a forthcoming article. Frequency lists and concordances (Scott, 1994) helped with the organization of the examples. The final result was the framework which will be discussed later.

# 4. Discourse community

The discourse community which uses this genre is made up of agri-business professionals who have graduated in Animal Health Studies and occupy top positions in the company, in the three surveyed companies. English is the lingua-franca, and only the British professionals have it as their mother tongue. This fact might lead to some language mistakes and inadequacies in language usage in the corpus, but as most professionals are highly educated, these drawbacks were found to be very few, and did not seem to interfere in the communicative understanding between the members of this community.

# 5. Communicative purpose

The communicative purpose which motivated the exchange of these letters is the interest on the part of the European companies to have their products represented by the Brazilian company in Brazil. To make this representation possible,

1. questions and doubts have to be exchanged and answered, 2. favours and services have to be rendered, and, most relevantly, 3. arrangements have to be settled so that everybody is committed to the agreement.

Futhermore, the Brazilian company had to provide sound evidence that the foreign company was making the right choice. These professionals are, therefore, negotiating and asking or submitting their questions, exposing doubts, adding points of view, and showing their knowledge of the market, showing flexibility in dealing with contentious issues, etc., in order to sign up a contract of representation to sell products in the Brazilian market. Most common issues exchanged in the letters come under the followings headings:

1. Description of companies (includes description of products and each company's performance).   
2. Marketing and Sales planning (includes customers, prices, agreements, problems and opportunities).   
3. Future planning (includes trips, meetings, congresses, seminars, courses).   
4. Brazilian market and trade rules (export/import).   
5. Contract of Representation or Letter of Intention (includes detailing product nationalization and market distribution).   
6. The exchange of information itself (includes follow-up of activities, actions, questions and answers, and telephone calls).

It is also worth mentioning that, due to the above motivating features as a whole, product quality and its characteristics and benefits are not as individually emphasized as one might expect. They are present in the letter exchange, but not as a high preference choice. The motivating issues, such as Marketing and Sales Planning, Brazilian market and others, as previously mentioned, seem to be more relevant at this stage of negotiation.

However, these letters are not simply promoting each company, as it may appear. There is an on-going exchange of information and request for action that ensures that the bond between companies is maintained - - as the framework, discussed later, indicates. Also, in contrast to the corpora of Bhatia's (1993a,b) promotional genre and Ghadessy's (1993) written business communication, this discourse community had face-to-face contact, and members could access each other by other channels such as the telephone.

Moreover, these characteristics of close availability and proximity permit the use of the written dialogue mode, intermingled with oral exchanges between the companies which use this genre.3 This "written dialogue" feature also contributes both to the amical atmosphere between participants and to the progression of the negotiation exchanges.

Based on all the above features, I decided to name this genre Business Letters of Negotiation (LNs). The context which surrounds and motivates this linguistic manifestation justifies the identification of this genre as Business Letters, and the dynamic of the exchange, which includes the type of linguistic choices and the communicative purpose, between the companies explains the name Negotiation.

Three types of letters were identified in the corpus:

1. Letters to provide information (includes letter of presentation), examples [001] and [002];4

Letter of Presentation:

i-a) Dutchvet is an international veterinary company, located in Holland and forming part of the HOLLVET group, which is also present in Brazil. Dutchvet operates on a worldwide basis.

(b) Major product lines are: biologicals for all species, hormones for improvement of breeding results and treatment of reproduction problems, antibiotics, mastitis/metritis products.

# FAX

(1) Thank you for the pictures of the Cholera Symposium and for the very interesting information.

John White and myself will arrive on 15th September on BA 245 at 0540 hrs (terrible time!) and leave on 18th September at 1600 hrs.

We will be staying at the Sheraton.

We would like to review business to date and your plans for the future.

We would also like to join you on some customer visits.

Ref.: visit Brasil, your fax 56/91 dated 14.1.1991.

Due to other travelling commitments not possible to change our programme.

Therefore suggest to organize a meeting with you on Thurday 7.2.1991 in Sao Paulo.

With pleasure will travel with you to Bela Vista in order to visit your plant.

Please note that we have to be in Rio de Janeiro on Friday 08.02.1991.   
around midday in order to catch our plane leaving at 14.45. (BA 244).

Would appreciate your cooperation with regard to booking flights:

Dear Monique.   
I acknowledge the receipt of your faxes 04.10.91 and 10.10.91.   
Regarding the first fax, we are unfortunately unable to raise data on the pending requirements for the Ministry of Agriculture, since we are not still your representative in Brazil.

Those facts mentioned to dr. Pesto was made in a officiously way, not a officially way, if know what I mean.

So we depend on the document you will provide to Brasvet as your distributor for the Ministry, and/or to Dr. Pesto as your responsible to obtain those information in a legal way.

It occurs to me that HOLLVET in Brazil could help us to get it. Should you nominate somebody I can talk to at HOLLVET, if you consider this interesting?

I am looking forward to hearing from you and Franz in order to settle my trip schedule.

# Very truly yours BRASHOLL11

# 5.1. Generic structure of business letters of negotiation

The analysis of the corpus made it possible to describe this genre by the pattern shown in Fig. 1. Four obligatory moves were identified:

M.1: Establishing the negotiation chain M.2: Providing information/answers M.3: Requesting information/action/favours M.4: Ending

These four main moves define and structure the features of Business Letters of Negotiation. Moves 1 and 4 work as a frame for the two other moves which alone are responsible for the content of the message. The negotiation takes place in the central moves 2 and 3 as they work as a stage where participants act and interact between each other. This is shown in Fig. 1.

![](img/f4cbed9aeaa20bcf96d036a9d0d1b8e157ceb4a516666c1833f74eb83fc0d649.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Business letters of negotiation.

M.1: Establishing the negotiation chain - occupying the header position on a letter this is the move which introduces and sets the scene and the communication chain, i.e. it provides the reference information that links a previous letter to the next one. This rhetorical function also gives information about participants, origin, and date, i.e. this move sets the scene of the communicative event. It also fulfills the greeting act of saying hello' to the addressee. It can be divided into steps as shown below.

(i) Defining participants

Reference - line

Step (iv) -- reference - line -- needs further attention as it provides this genre with a dialogue-like feature (Ghadessy, 1993). This line appears in all letters, except for the first letter, and helps the participants to keep track of the negotiation chain. Moreover, it shows the reader that this communicative event has a sequence in terms of message exchange.

Following Ghadessy's (1993) findings, each letter is a turn, and each turn is linked to the previous one and to the next one through the reference - line.

Consequently, the exchange of these letters follows a chain of requesting and giving either information or actions and services as if it were a dialogue in oral interaction. The only exception is that the time that elapses is much longer because it is a reading interaction which uses a fax machine as its method of delivery (Eggins, 1994, pp. 53-57).

The examples, [008] and [009], from two different companies shown below indicate the most common order followed in the corpus. As can be seen, the top elements come mainly as printed sections with a blank to be filled out.

(i)

(i) SINGLE MESSAGE ADDITIONAL QUANTITY PAGES DOCUMENTS SIMPLE MESSAGE DOCUMENTE QUANTITEPAGE ADDITIONNEL   
(iv) RE: VISIT BRAZIL BRASHOLL04

F.4: Ending -- this last move characterizes the end of the letter. Here, the participants sign off and give individual professional data, such as full name and rank status in the company, to the addressee. It can be divided into the following steps:

(i) Signing off   
(ii) Signature - line   
(iii) Job status in the company   
(iv) Company credentials   
(v) Note and PS - line   
(vi) Copy to - line   
(vii) File data

The sequence presented above is the most frequent in the corpus, but not all steps always appear. Steps (i), (ii) are the most frequent, the others may occur according to the communicative motivation, as can be seen in the examples below:

(i) I look forward to your co-operation and welcome any ideas or comments.

(i) Yours sincerely

(ii) Erik Henau   
(ii) Export Regional Manager BRITVET01

(i) Thank you in advance for your cooperation and wishing you (i) a nice weekend!

(i) Regards, (ii) Isabelle Davies

(v) P.S. Please note that you will only have to take care of reservations for the flights (not tickets), as Mr. van Boock and Mr. Bohn both have an open ticket. HOLLVET10

Example [011] shows a PS - line which is relevant in the corpus because it can either function as last-minute information or it can be used to convey relevant information that deserves special attention, and is, for this reason, highlighted.

Both M.2: Providing information/answers and M.3: Requesting information/action/ favours contain the real content of the message which is exchanged between the participants, i.e. they account for the communicative purpose which generates the genre. Both moves are equally important in this genre as a whole, as examples from [001] to [007] show. However, in this corpus, when they occur in the same letter (see hybrid letters, examples [005], [006] and [007]), providing information comes first. This sequence of first providing information and second requesting information/ action/favours follows the traditional attitude of: first, solve problems and/or talk about things that are shared by everybody; second, introduce what is new or desired. I shall discuss each of these separately:

M.2: Providing information/answers - this, as the name suggests, provides answers and information which may either be new or shared by both counterparts. It can be divided into optional steps and sub-steps as shown below. Examples [001] and [002] provide an overview of the organization of this move according to steps and sub-steps.

(i) Information:

(a) Introducing and providing information   
(b) Continuing/adding   
(c) Up-dating   
(d) Agreeing

(e) Showing opposition (unexpected results) (ii) Advising about message: (a) by mail (b) along with the fax (c) within the fax

Direct discourse and first person signals (including $I , \ w e )$ , and/or names of employees all predominate in this rhetorical function. This choice of personal pronoun or name emphasises that it is the person providing the information rather than the company or the department, as can be seen in the examples below (refer to Appendix A for futher examples).

[012].. .I cannot definitely make it. (BRASHOLL39)   
[013]I will send you copies as soon as they are ready. (BRITVET14)   
[014]I will tell you that we are well advanced on our plans for... (BRITVET11)   
[015]We are still working on the information as requested by Mr. Norberto Fonseca Donner in his fax dated September 22nd. (HOLLVET36)   
[016]We also have available for some products presentations... (HOLLVET29)   
[017]Dr. Oswaldo Ferreira and Dr. Norberto Donner are coming along for the visit and will be honoured to meet your people overthere. (BRASHOLL10)   
[018]Dra. Angelica F. Ferreira will be with us as well. (BRASHOLL09)   
[019]...Paula and Evita Dominguez agree on the subject of Evita's talks (BRITVET13)

There are also examples in which the message itself is the actor -- represented mainly by the defining pronoun this, or by words related to content or ideas, but all these element choices occur in a small number. The examples below illustrate these features.5 [020]This is a little note to let you know that we are to... (BRASHOLL12) [021]The courses will give the participants a basic introduction... (BRITVET07) [022]A separate analysis will follow. (HOLLVET13)

M.3: Requesting information/action/favours - as move 2, this move can also be divided into optional steps and sub-steps. Note that the categories of these steps are related to the nature of the request: either information - verbal action, or action/ favour - attitudinal/performing action (Halliday, 1994, pp. 68-69).

(i Information (a) Explaining/clarifying (b) Giving opinion/comments/guidance/suggestions (c) Confirming information

(d) Acknowledging receipt of a message (ii) Exchange of ideas/discussions (iii) Actions/favours of (b) Material/document mailing (c) Service/action/attitude/help

Requesting can be carried out through interrogatives, imperatives or declaratives. Depending on the nature of the request, interrogatives and declaratives may come directly or mitigated by could or would, or by the expression would like. These choices are usually followed by please which strengthens the aspect of politeness and adds to the exchange an atmosphere of extreme formalism and respect and facesaving as in Charles (1996). Another possibility for minimizing the impact of a request is the use of adverbs such as gently and kindly. I give below a few examples of these uses (refer to Appendix 2 for a more delailed exemplification).

[023]How many companies will be represented? (BRITVET11)   
[024]Do you think it would be possible to be there on April 18th, 19th for visiting Dutchvet? (BRASHOLL03)   
[025]3)Do you have a detailed timetable of deadline for events leading to the congress? (BRITVET11)   
[026]Would you please inform the price and payment conditions for the antigen above mentioned? (HOLLVET32)   
[027]Could you please send us the information as requested in a.m. fax. (HOLLVET41)   
[028]We would like to know if this date is convenient to Exeid's staff. Please let me know as soon as possible. (BRASBRIT04)   
[029]Since you are not in the consultorio market and fear that some laboratories may blacklist you if you get found out I would like a confirmation. (BRITVET17)   
[030]We gently ask you to follow strictly our shipping instructions. (BRASBRIT02)   
[031]We kindly ask you to contact this company for more information on our products. (HOLLVET20)

Imperatives, on the other hand, are always preceeded by please, which reduces the impact of command of the chosen mode as the examples below show.

[032]Please let us know your flight schedule in order to arrange transport. (HOLLVET06) [033]Please confirm reservation of flights and hotel as requested.. .(HOLLVET08) [034JOBS.: PLEASE CONFIRM THE RECEIPT OF THIS FAX. (BRITVET05) [035]Please check whether price levels are still correct. (HOLLVET26)

Another possibility is the use of need. In this case, the strength of the request is high, and implies that the addressee has no other way than to provide what is needed.

If-clauses are also a possibility (example [040]). They can substitute for direct interrogatives and the impact they have on the reader is the possibility they open to decide upon answering the question or not, or even commenting on some matter.6

[036]I will need the nett FOB price you need to compete. (BRITVET09)   
[037]For 1994 I will need a commitment to at least 100,00 tests and I will trya and obtain price below 20 USD. (BRITVET17)   
[038]We will need a document of Hollvet do Brazil giving authorization to Brasvet to ask an original certificate of product registration. Dr Maria Eugenia is working on that with Mr Maestrino. (BRASHOLL19)   
[039]We need urgently our inscription ticket to show in american embassy. Please send us by fax a.s.a.p. (BRASHOLL38)   
[040]If you have any comment on this schedule, please, just let us know. (BRASHOLL09)

As the examples presented above show, requests, in this corpus, can be made through interrogatives (yes/no, wh-, or modulated would), or through imperative -- always accompanied by the modal adjunct of entreaty, please'. The addressee is always the person aimed at, and it can be done either overtly, through interrogatives, or covertly, through imperatives.

This corpus was also found to present steps which are common to both moves 2 and 3, i.e. they can come together with either one of the two main moves. They are:

(iv) Apologizing   
(v) Offering something in return/incentives   
(vi) Evaluating a. giving personal opinion b. making comments' c. indicating: i-availability ii-wishes/plans/intentions/engagement   
(vii) Drawing attention to something   
(viii) Applying pressure tactics (in different degrees)

These steps are the rhetorical functions in which negotiation strategies are brought into play. They are where the participants give opinions, make comments, and show flexibility within the process of dealing. By doing so, writers lay themselves open and show the reader the human being behind the pen. These features can be identified by the use of certain lexical options which carry the meaning of personal impact or emotional feelings such as regret, believe, feel, trust and hope - all processes of mental nature. The examples below briefly illustrate this option (Appendix 3 lists further examples on common steps). Example [041] refers to sub-step (iv) Apologising; numbers [042] and [043] to (vi-a.) Evaluating-giving personal opinion; number [044] illustrates (vi-b.) Evaluating-making comments, and [045] (vi-c.ii) Evaluatingindicating.wishes/plans/intentions/engagement

[041]We regret the impossibility of our visit... (BRASHOLL07)   
[042]I believe it is not sensible to prepare a professional, focused meeting for a large number of delegates in a few days. My own experience is that a considerable amount of work and time are required. (BRITVET11)   
[043]I feel awful for that since... (BRASHOLL39)   
[044]we trust that with the a.m. prices you can prepare a new calculation. (HOLLVET16)   
[045]I hope to have time to reach you before you're going there. (BRASHOLL15)

Showing flexibility or availability seems to be an important strategy for this genre (sub-step vi-c.i). It occurs in most of the letters and provides the addressee with the possibility of questioning any previous statement or request. It is usually realised through the hypothetical expressions of if-clauses or in case of. These choices contribute to an atmosphere of constant movement and dynamic exchange, working out as a tactic that keeps the exchange going on (Lampi, 1993).8

[046]In case you need to postpone or to antecipate your trip, please, just let us know in advance for preparing another schedule. (BRASHOLL04)   
[047]If you happen to have other sugestion or request, please just let us know about it. (BRASHOLL05)   
[048]If you have any questions please let me know. (BRITVET13)   
[049]If you have any doubt, please don't hesitate to contact me or Mr. Quintana. (BRASHOLL38)   
[050jIf I can be of any help for other information, please let me know. (BRASHOLL36)   
[051]If necessary and probably in a later stage we of course are willing to work with a system of semi-finished products (bulk etc.). (HOLLVET12)   
[052]If these data are convenient for you, please make a hotel reservation in Hotel transamerican (or other hotel close to your office) for one night (19.12.1991). (HOLLVET17)

Linguistic choices in terms of structure and lexical choice follow the same pattern as in moves 2 and 3: the most common forms chosen for the content in these common steps are direct discourse which includes declarative and interrogative sentences, hypothetical (if-clauses and in case) forms, and imperative mode to introduce propositions.

Since they present more personal expressions, these steps sometimes overlap with another step from move 2 or 3. This occurs mainly because a speaker can express more than one meaning or function at the same time (Halliday, 1994, pp. 29-30).

By studying the three examples below, one can notice that in example [053], the writer is asking about a possibility as well as giving a suggestion. Yet in example [054], besides calling attention to the message the writer is also indirectly requesting a meeting. Finally, the use of the emphatic do together with the modal need create an atmosphere of pressure in example [055].

[053]If not possible suggest to have meeting on 18.04.1991. (HOLLVET06)   
[054]Please note that we are very interested to meet you in the mentioned date. (BRASHOLL01).   
[055]I do need the draft of your letter of intent before our departure, so we can appreciate it in depth before any eventual suggestion for that. (BRASHOLL10)

If it were not for these common steps shared by both moves 2 and 3 the corpus researched would be the genre of information exchange only (see Santos, 1994b). However, the implications of the sub-steps outlined above, allow us to classify this corpus as an example of the negotiation genre.

# 6. Discussion of results

The analysis developed here suggested patterns of rhetorical elements which can be classified as the genre of Business Letters of Negotiation. As the Communicative Purpose is the "primary determinant' (Swales, 1990, pp. 9-10) for content and style, there is a high probability that this genre is shared by other Discourse Communities from different fields.

Moves 1 and 4 fulfill the social ritual of greeting and work as a kind of frame for the central functions. They both display information about origin, destiny and participants, as well as define the subject which motivated the exchange of mail. The Reference- line, identified in the corpus, besides providing 'given' or shared information, also acts as a link between the previous letter and the current one, providing a chain-like interaction in which each letter can be interpreted as a turn (Ghadessy, 1993).

Moves 2 and 3, on the other hand, provide 'new' information and the real' content of the interaction. Working out as a settting, they display the shared need or the purpose which generated the communication: the exchange of information and the request for favours and services. It is also in these central rhetorical functions that the participants express their ideas, give opinions, express power over the others, and find space to negotiate dynamically, as well as successfully, the primary communicative purpose: the signing of a contract of representation.

Sequencing of moves is highly regular and follows the numerical order displayed in the framework. When moves 2 and 3 occur together in the same message, providing information comes before the act of requesting. This pattern conforms with the idea of shared knowledge anticipating new information. It also conforms with the social attitude of talking about something speakers share beforehand, as if to prepare the ground to introduce what is new.

Another interesting issue brought about in the results is the fact that some choices can perform more than one rhetorical function such as the example

[056]Please note that in order to be succesful with finished product... (HOLLVET49)

in which the writer both draws attention to the message and applies pressure so that some action gets done. Another instance is example [057],

[057]I suggest we instigate some competitiveness among these distributors...(BRITVET09)

in which the writer puts a pressure on an action by means of a suggestion; or even examples [058] and [059]:

[058]I would like to ask for your help. We need the reservation at Marriot Hotel,...(BRASHOLL10)   
[059]We kindly ask you to contact this company for more information on our products. (HOLLVET20)

where a choice for either a degree of formality or a modal adjunct of entreaty (Halliday, 1994:49) is used as a means of respect and solidarity. These features show how people make use of language to mean different things, i.e. the multifunctionality of linguistic items (Halliday, pp. 29-30).

The detailed observation of certain lexical choices which characterize the moves, steps and sub-steps in the corpus also revealed interesting topics for discussion. The choice of participants, for instance, in which, depending on the intention of the sender, defines a larger or shorter distance. The use of informal and engaged first person singular, $I ,$ as opposed to first person plural, we, third parties, he/she/proper names, or reference to the message itself, it|this, are possibilities of this kind. The option for first person singular provides a more personalised prefessional attitude, i.e. the writer is focusing on him/herself and shifting the responsibility of the message from the company, which can be expressed by its name or the corporative - we, to him/her as an individual.

Another issue is the use of formal expressions such as modals, adjuncts of entreaty and hypothetical expressions. These lexical choices help to create an atmosphere of cordiality and respect in contrast with overt power despite the differences in terms of language status, business interests and market knowledge which emerge between the three companies.

The unexpected choice of indirect questions with hypothetical expressions, interrogatives to request services, and minimized imperatives to request either services or information  as opposed to what Halliday (1994, p. 8-9) claims as typical - also contributes to this atmosphere of mutual solidarity.

As pointed out by Charles (1996), linguistic choices can be shaped by the market situation, and status-role rank, in the sense that polite elements and informal pronouns are used for face-saving, power disguising and proximity tactics. In other words, linguistic elements are being used to create an atmosphere of friendship and respect so as to guarantee the maintenance of an amicable atomosphere, the commitment between particpants, the progress of the business interaction, and to reach the primary motivation for the communicative interaction: to settle a representation agreement between companies.

# 7. Final considerations and teaching implications

This article aims to make a small contribution to the research into Business English aimed at teaching approaches and materials production (St. John, 1996). The framework presented shows how the surveyed discourse community consisting of business professionals from the pharmaceutical-veterinary market convey their communicative meanings and purpose effectively through the obligatory rhetorical functions described. The fact of being restricted to one type of community may give us the idea that these results are too specific. However, due to the general communicative purpose which generates the exchange of messages, i.e. to have products represented by another company, one can suppose that there is a good chance that other fields of work also share the same linguistic features described here.

This genre-based analysis offers to linguistic researchers as well as to EFL/ESPteachers insights which can be applied and taught to students. Foreign language teaching can greatly benefit from it, mainly because it is an authentic sample of language in use. However, one important point has to be made in order to avoid an over-use or misuse of it: genre approach is a useful tool if one is looking for a holistic teaching methodology but it has to be understood as a clarificatory description rather than prescription (Swales, 1990, p. 45; Bhatia, 1993a, p. 182), i.e. "pattern seeking' rather than "pattern imposing (Bhatia, p. 40) for language use is dynamic and not fixed. Of course, one cannot ensure success in foreign language communication simply by teaching contextualized linguistic, and cultural and social differences, yet by making students aware of the implications and the purpose of such differences one can, at least, contribute to a student's pragmatic progress in his/her professional activity and, hopefully in the long-term, avoid miscommunication.

From the contrastive point of view, a further description of this genre, focusing on each individual cultural pattern, could provide information about what is idiosyncratic or ethnic-related, and what is "universal' or conventional to the genre. Further, a cross-cultural description can provide insights about which features are related to participant hiererchical position and which are culturally motivated. In other words, students can become aware of the vast range of lexico-grammatical choices in English and their relation to the communicative purposes in different contexts of use.

Finally, this study presents only one aspect of the whole business world. It analyses one specific genre of written production from a specific discourse community and, as Nickerson (1998, p. 292) points out, it is not sufficient. It does not, for example, analyse the influence of the corporate culture and national cultures in the choices of linguistic items, or the influence of the new communication media to achieve the same rhetorical functions, or the participation of the oral mode in the writing process within institutional contexts, or even how other professional communities accomplish the moves described in this investigation, to list a few.

As writing is a social activity, a thick description taking account of the sociolinguistic frameworks of business communiction can provide useful evidence for EFL and ESP researchers and teachers (Harrison, 1987; St. John, 1996; Charles, 1996; Gunnarson, 1997; Nickerson, 1998; Louhaila-Salminen, 2002). As Harrison, St. John, Charles, Gunnarson, Nickerson and Louhiala-Salminen claim, these approaches can, for example, provide explanations of which linguistic choices characterise new and old relationships, how corporate culture influences and restricts both oral and written production, how communication networks are made up, and how English, as lingua franca, is used within company borders. They can help language professionals not only to describe the context of use, but also to explain linguistic choices.

Summing up, genre analysis seems to provide students with precious data from languge in use to what concerns teaching implications. However, from a deeper discourse perspective, the definition of the Communicative Purpose, together with the description of the Communicative Discourse and language choices does not seem to generate enough evidence about the relationship between context and language choices (see Louhiala-Salminen, 1996, p. 48, for example). Holistic approaches such as those suggested by St. John (1996), Gunnarson (1997), Firth, (1991), and Louhiala-Salminen (2002) seem to provide teachers, and consequently students, with more comprehensive data about context effects on language communcative processes within genres.
