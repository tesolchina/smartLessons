# Rethinking International Migration of Human Capital and Brain Circulation: The Case of Chinese-Canadian Academics

# Dongyan Ru Blachford' and Bailing Zhang

# Abstract

This article examines the dynamics of brain circulation through a historical review of the debates over international migration of human capital and a case study on Chinese-Canadian academics. Interviews with 22 Chinese-Canadian professors who originally came from China provide rich data regarding the possibilities and problems of the contemporary global mobility.The findings indicate that brain circulation is possible in the case of Chinese-Canadian academics but that certain conditions and factors, especially some disparity issues associated with international migration of human capital, have prevented a more effective brain circulation from taking place. This article argues that addressing these disparity issues will be an indispensable step toward fostering an effective global human capital circulation and knowledge exchange.

# Introduction

The international migration of people dates back to the beginning of recorded human history (Koser, 2007), but the past decade has experienced an unprecedented increase in migratory flows with the growing intensity of global interconnectedness and interdependence, even though cross-border migration is still "tightly regulated and controlled(p.49).While the blurring national boundaryOlmos & Torres, 2009, p.80) has greatly facilitated the exchange of technology, ideas, and cultures, it has also become the object of considerable academic and governmental interest and debate. It is estimated that at the end of 2005, about $3 \%$ of the world's population were migrants who reside outside of their birth country, including a large number of skilled and professional workers who have moved from developing countries to developed countries (Chen, 2007).As Spring (2008) indicates,Wealthier nations, which have 16 per cent of the world's workers, have more than 60 per cent of global migrants(p.340).This phenomenon of international migration of human capital (IMHC) has for a long time been framed as a"brain drain a one-way movement, or an exodus, that only covered migratory flows from the South to the North, from the developing to the developed countries, and only benefited the industrialized countriesGaillard & Gaillard1997,p.195).As IMHC is pivotal to contemporary knowledge-based economies, the past two decades have seen more academic debates on whether it has a pure drain effect on the source countries, or rather if it could lead to a potential brain gain' for them or a global brain circulation' in the long run.

# Brain Drain or Brain Circulation: The Decades-Long Debates over IMHC

Before 1990, IMHC was generally regarded to have a drain effect for less developed countries, and thus deemed a "problem that needed to be solved. Research during this period, therefore, tended to analyze the causes and outcomes of IMHC and propose solutions for policy makers. In the 1970s, scholars such as Bhagwati and Hamada (1974) and McCulloch and Yellen (1975) began the theoretical analysis of IMHC.IMHC was generally considered the result of less economic opportunities in developing countries, weaknesses in their existing educational and research systems, political instability, family reasons (e.g.,children's education), and the ineffectiveness of particular national sociopolitical structures in which the individual decisions were made Gish & Godfrey1979;Glaser,1978; Khasawnih1986;Lien1988).As Glaser and Habers (1978) summarized, to avoid brain drain and attract emigrants back, the countries of origin had to acquire political stability, a minimum of economic development and a scientific policy that favours the exercise of scientific and technical professions(as cited in Gaillard & Gaillard, 1997p.221). The issue of IMHC appeared mostly in journals on economics, rather than those on education or sociology. The economic dimension of IMHC had been the centre of discussion, and quantitative research methods were used in a majority of the published research.

Before 1990, although the mainstream academic discourse viewed IMHC as a brain drain'for the developing world, a number of studies also turned their sights on the potential benefits that IMHC would bring to the source countries. Ahmad (1970), for example, suggested:

In studies relating to migration of scientific and technical manpower, it is desirable to avoid the term "brain drain' as much as possible because it connotes a one-way traffic of brains and carries emotional undertones. The global nature of the phenomenon is best described as migration,flight or exchange of scientific and technical personnel. (p.217)

Ahmad (1970) also suggested that for those who went to developed countries for short-term education or training and planned to return to their native country, their temporary absence during learning or training could only be viewed as a future gain rather than a drain for their native countries, unless their stay abroad exceeded a certain length of time (e.g., 5 years or so).For those who permanently emigrated, Ahmad suggested, their absence could be regarded as a brain drain. It is worth noting that Ahmad, like most other scholars of his time, believed that these educated and skilled workers'extended "physical' absence from their birth country would result in a brain drain of the country.Zelinsky (1971), however, predicted that there would be an "advanced society"in which there may be significant international migration or circulation of skilled and professional persons,'and that the direction and volume of this woulddepend on specific conditions(p.230).

Zelinsky's prediction has come true to some extent in the past two decades with the intensification of globalization.In the 1990s, terms such as brain gainbrain circulation and brain exchangebegan to emerge in academic discourse.Salt (1997) defines brain exchange as a two-way flow of expertise between a source country and a receiving county.Where the net flow is heavily biased in one direction, the terms brain gain or brain drain is used. Another term, brain circulation, as Johnson and Regets (1998) defined, described the international mobility of highly educated workers, the cycle of moving abroad to studythen taking a job abroad, and later returning home to take advantage of a good opportunity.IMHC, many scholars agree, has the potential to bring benefits to the source countries in the long run.Stark,Helmenstein, and Prskawetz (1997) for example, suggested that IMHC and the associated different structure of incentives" would "give rise to a brain gain in conjunction with a brain drain" and that the source country could "end up with a higher average level of human capital per worker(p.227)

A number of other studies were concerned about the sustainability of brain gain and therefore called for policy interventions. For example, Krishna and Khadria (1997) examined India's loss of scientific and technical human resources. They suggested that "any relative short-term gains visible in the form of brain gain and arresting the process of brain drain are likely to be neutralized by the lack of appropriate long-term policy measures(Krishna & Khadria,p.347) and that policy interventions to address IMHC are therefore urgently needed.

In the 1990s,the belief of brain circulation as the consequence of IMHC was prominent, but it was based on the premise that human capital migrating abroad would increasingly stay temporarily rather than permanently (Gaillard & Gaillard, 1997).

Apparently, this premise is untenable in the case of China and many other developing countries, as will be discussed later.

Since 2000, however, the term brain circulation has been given a number of new interpretations. The physical return of the emigrants is no longer a requirement to achieve brain circulation. Rather, as Saxenian (2006) suggested, brain circulation reflects the complex relationship between the skilled emigrants, their countries and elsewhere; this conception of brain circulation helps "to distinguish the issue of knowledge transfer from the physical presence of the individual migrant (Ackers 2005, p.100).Brain circulationunlike brain drain or brain gain, which emphasizes the general outcome of IMHC for source or receiving countries, emphasizes the process in which people and knowledge are circulated in the global context. Hart (2006) and Saxenian (2002), for example, argued that even though the loss of professionals represented a drain effect for source countries, at the same time it strengthened the overall educational quality of the developing countries and eventually benefited their economic development. Hart (2006) suggested that if "managed wisely, a global knowledge economy would foster "mutual gain'and enable source countries to benefit from the circulation (p. 53).Meanwhile, the impacts of diasporic communities also gained salience in the discussion of IMHC. Diaspora here refers to a dispersed group of people who settle outside of their homeland, but continue to have relations with their homeland.Although physically abroad, diasporic communities continue to make contributions to their homeland through financial,social, cultural, and educational transfers. A number of studies have explored the diaspora effect on developing countries Agrawal,Kapur McHale & Oettl,2011; Lin2010;Lindley2008; Meyer 2001; Rahman & Khan,2007;Zweig,Fung & Han2008)and have suggested that IMHC has the potential for promoting the development of the emigrants' home countries in the long run.

Though the prospect of IMHC looks promising based on the above perspectives, to simply replace brain drain with brain circulation is still problematic for some scholars such as Rizvi (2005, 2009a) and Teferra (2005).Brain circulation, as Teferra (2005) pointed out, is still "characterized by its sporadic, exceptional, and limited nature"(as cited in Rizvi, 2005, p.189).Rizvi (2005 suggested that most of the diaspora networks were short-termed, and therefore fail to become systematic, dense, and productive'(p.189).Moreover, disparity issues within IMHC are widespread.As Teferra (2005) has argued, brain circulation in the contemporary era is not a neutral circulation, but is characterized by unparalleled opportunities and underlying challenges. Similarly, Rizvi (2005) looked beyond the human resource analysis of IMHC that dominated much of the literature, and examined how IMHC had "become much more complex in the global era(p.177.Brain drain,as Rizvi (2005 suggested, is linked to a broader range of postcolonial issues of identity, shifting notions of national affiliation, and cultural change(p.177).

It has to be acknowledged that though many academic studies suggested that the impact of IMHC on the receiving countries is positive, some viewed this differently.

A recent study by Borjas and Doran (2012),for example, examined the case of the former Soviet mathematicians who immigrated to the United States after the fall of the communist in 1992,and alerted that in this case, as might be true in others as well, this capital movement had resulted in a productivity decline of the mathematicians in the United States, as was demonstrated in the group of American mathematicians whose pre-1990 work most overlapped with that of the former Soviets. Borjas (2003) also argues that though immigration boosts growth overall ... the benefits are unevenly distributed and that those workers who are competing for jobs with migrants will lose from immigration through lower wages or crowding out(as cited in Goldin, Cameron &Balarajan,2011,p.165

Though today's debate over IMHC involves multidimensional analysis, an important but understudied area is the dynamics of brain circulation, and a far deeper understanding of the limits and possibilities of IMHC is therefore indeed needed.Also, existing literature has revealed a significant lack of empirical data, especially qualitative data that can lead to a deeper analysis of IMHC.This article will share our research findings on the case of Chinese-Canadian academics to explore how the possibilities and limits of brain circulation can be understood and interpreted in the contemporary globalized world.

# China's Outflow of Human Capital

Over the past three decades,China has experienced an unprecedented outflow of human capital. Though emigration has taken various forms, one major pattern has been the emigration of students who initially went abroad for study, but eventually decided to stay in the host countries.Before 1981, students who went abroad were mainly government sponsored (Cao, 2009).In 1981, the Chinese government started to allow private students to study abroad (Cao,2009).Since 1993,encouraging national policies in China have resulted in a rapidly increasing number of private students going abroad Cao, 2009).Statistics show that an estimated 1,905,400 Chinese have left the country to study overseas between 1978 and 2010, mainly in the United Kingdom and the United States, but that the returnees from abroad were less than one third of the total number by the end of 2010 (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2011).

In the past decade, with a fast growing economy China has witnessed a reversing trend with an increasing percentage of returnees. In 2010 alone, for example, the total number of students and scholars going abroad was 284,700 and the number of returnees was 134, 800 (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2010). The problem, however, is that the overall quality of the returnees is not comparable to those who remain abroad Rosen & Zweig,2004), in terms of international prestige and research potential.For example,it is estimated that in 2005 among the 30,000 returnees, about half of them had only a bachelor's degree or a one-year master's degree (Zweig, 2006). Therefore, a larger number of them are not bringing back the latest international technology as had been assumed. Rather, many of them chose to return largely because of their unpromising career prospects abroad (Zweig,2006).As for the top researchers and scholars, the majority remain abroad (Zweig, 2006).

To entice these highly educated citizens to return, the Chinese central government has crafted a number of policies, such as innovative ways of attracting top-notch scholars to return and work in China with more flexibility, making preferential policies concerning the procedures for starting an enterprise, helping the returnees' children to study in local schools, and assisting their spouses to secure employment. On top of these, the government has launched several programs, such as the Program for Training Talents toward the 21st Century, the Chunhui (literally,Spring Bud) Program,Changjiang Scholar Incentive Program," and the Program of Academic Short-return for Scholars and Research Overseas, to provide the returnees with special benefits and better working conditions. The "Program for Training Talents toward the 21st Century, for example, targets outstanding young teachers who have returned from overseas studies.Since its inception in 1993, 11 batches of 922 people have been supported at a cost of more than 180,000,000 RMB (approximately US\$28,491,832) (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2010). Some regional governments and enterprises (institutions or organizations) are also running various overseas recruitment campaigns aimed at luring Chinese students currently studying abroad to return.

A variety of reasons have been identified to explain why the majority of foreigntrained people choose to stay abroad, despite the favorable national and regional policies. Undoubtedly, the generally low economic return is still one of the major reasons. A recent survey reveals that the average starting monthly salaries for overseas returnees are now only 3,000 RMB (approximately US\$475)similar to the earnings of a graduate from a Chinese university (Su 2011).More notably,Cao (2009) suggests that a stable political environment a healthy and complete legal system, and a fair competition mechanism are other essential elements to foster an effective brain return to China.

Meanwhile, since the 1980s the Chinese government has made great efforts to attract more foreign students to study in China, and the number of exchange students studying in China has been increasing.For example, in 2000, the total number of foreign students studying in China was 44,711,coming from 164 countries (Huang,2003, p.231), and by 2011,the Chinese mainland has received 292,611 international students from 194 countries and regions (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2012).

# Canadian Policy Context for Chinese-Canadian Academics

Globalization has also made the governments of the developed counties more aware of the importance of higher education and that attracting more international students to study in their countries would have a potential to cultivate more professionals for their own countries. Take Canada for example: Since 1945, labor migration has been recognized as a key factor "in the growth and restructuring of industrial economies Li,2008,p.219).One major means of attracting foreign students to stay in Canada is its immigration policy,which stipulates specifically that foreigners who are "skilled workers and professionalscan apply for permanent residence in Canada. In 2002, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 (Asian Pacific Foundation of Canada, 2012), and the new Act indicated that the most desirable potential immigrants under the category of "skilled workers were those aged from 21 to 49, who had a master's or doctoral degree, more than four years work experience, a high level of proficiency in English or French and other abilities that would help them to establish themselves in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2010). These particular requirements have prevented many less skilled foreign laborers from immigrating. In 2010, 89,840 skilled professionals and their dependants emigrated from the top Asian source countries to Canada, which comprised $67 \%$ of all emigrants from these countries; among these 89,840 people,22,265 were Chinese (Asian Pacific Foundation of Canada,2012).Between 1996 and 2000, Canada "saved some 1.8 million dollars in educational expenses by accepting immigrants from China with university degrees (Li, 2008, p.231).

To attract more excellent international students to stay, in 2008 the modified immigration policy began to stipulate a preference for the temporary foreign worker with at least two years of full-time (or equivalent) skilled work experience in Canada, or a foreign graduate from a Canadian postsecondary institution with at least one year of full-time (or equivalent) skilled work experience in Canada' (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2008a). At the same time, the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program was initiated that allowed "most international students who have graduated from an eligible program at a post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience and a minimum of one year of work experience in managerial, professional or technical positions will be necessary to apply to stay permanently through the Canadian Experience Class" (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2008b). In 2008, to show its intention of attracting and retaining talented international students, Canada's federal government "announced plans to dramatically speed up immigration processing time for certain in-demand occupations, and for international students, in 2009 (CanWest News Service,November 28,2008).Even since July 1, 2012,Canada has temporarily stopped accepting applications for the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), this temporary pause does not apply to those with a qualifying job offer or applying under the PhD stream"(Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2012a.On August 17,2012, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) proposed the following changes to the FSWP,which will likely take effect in January,2013:

Making language the most important selection factor by establishing new minimum official language thresholds and increasing points for language; Increasing the emphasis on younger immigrants, who are more likely to acquire valuable

Canadian experience and remain in the workforce longer; Increasing points for Canadian work experience and reducing points for foreign work experience; Simplifying the arranged employment process to prevent fraud and abuse yet enable employers to staff positions quickly; and, Awarding points for spousal language ability and Canadian experience. (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2012b)

All these policy modifications between 2008 and 2012 have indicated that Canada will continue to attract highly educated migrants, especially younger immigrants.In 2009,200,000 international students came to Canada,among which 50,000 were from China, representing the largest group of foreign students in this country (Government of Canada, 2012). For those skilled professionals who apply for immigration directly from the source countries, such as China, the emphasis on Canadian experience and the raised language bar, on the other hand, has made it especially difficult for them to become Canadian permanent residents. Even for those who already immigrated to Canada, they have encountered various difficulties in meeting occupational entry requirements, and have faced more obstacles than native-born Canadians or immigrants from European countries (Pendakur & Pendakur 1998,2002). In an article analyzing the economic worth of human capital transferred from China to Canada, Li (2008) finds that the productivity capabilities of China-born university-educated immigrants have not been fully realized in the Canadian labor market. Similarly, another research (Li, 2004) reveals that the credentials of foreign-trained professional immigrants are not properly and fairly evaluated. Based on survey data collected in several major cities of Canada between 1997 and 1999, Li (2004) finds that among 1,180 respondents, $7 9 \%$ reported that they had worked as professional in China before immigrating,but only $3 1 \%$ said they worked or had worked as professionals in Canada, and $2 2 . 4 \%$ had never worked in Canada at all. In addition to the existing discounting of qualifications and racial discrimination mentioned previously, other immigration policy changes such as a moratorium on family sponsorships as recently proposed by CIC, will also have a negative impact on the future scale of Chinese skilled migration, including the flow of Chinese academics, which will definitely prohibit skill/knowledge circulation.Just as Danso (2009) suggested,neo-liberal and institutionalized racist policies and practices intersect in many ways to marginalize and exclude skilled immigrants of colour in Canada (p.540).

# Research Purpose and Questions

The outflow of talent has left China facing a severe human capital shortage, especially in terms of scientific productivity.Zweig, Fung and Han (2008) indicates,

Using data on publications by Chinese scientists in 1995-2000, and their year of birth, Jin, Li and Rousseau showed that the brain drain created a research gap within China's scientific community; people between ages 28 and 36 were not publishing in China in fact, many of them were not in China at all, but instead were abroad.Yet in most countries, this group forms the most productive age cohort in the natural sciences. China's lost scientific productivity, they conclude,is indeed great (Jin et al.,2004,p.547,as cited in ZweigFung,& Han, 2008,p.3.

Yet on the other hand, it has been recognized that the diasporic Chinese communities have also made tremendous contributions to China's economic and scientific development (Cao2009Pan2008;ZweigFung& Han2008).However, among the limited number of studies on China's diasporic effect, there is a significant lack of empirical studies that examine the possibilities and limits of brain circulation from both the economic and the sociocultural dimensions.This study,therefore, intends to examine the dynamics of brain circulation in the case of the Chinese-Canadian academics focusing on the following questions: (a What are the participants'roles and contributions to both their host country,Canada, and their birth country, China (b)Is brain circulation possible? If it is, what stimulates and encourages an effective brain circulation? (c) What may limit and inhibit an effective brain circulation? Through exploring these questions, it is the hope of the authors that the findings of this study could impact policymaking and stimulate future studies.

It has to be emphasized here that brain circulation does not refer to the physical circular movement of skilled labor across nations; rather, it refers to the circulation of intangible knowledge and values that will contribute to the development of both the source and receiving countries and beyond.

# Our Position

IMHC is both inevitable and inherently positive, and human capital is the most important resource for the development of the global economy and overall well being of the human society.Despite the competitive nature of the global economy, however, it is incumbent on all to ensure that developing countries and emerging countries must benefit from the talent migration. In this article, we suggest that there is a moral imperative to make talent circulation more effective and equitable or at least, to ensure value to those countries more likely to produce emigrants than immigrants.

# Participants Selection and Research Method

We specifically chose to examine the group of academics, not only because there is a huge lack of empirical qualitative data in the case of overseas Chinese academics, but also because this particular immigration group best reflects the possibility of brain circulation within the context of global mobility, as these professors have played a special and important role in the transnational transfer of knowledge, funds, and culture in the contemporary age of globalization.Also, this is the specific group that China had hoped to attract back, and they have been considered by many as a drain to China and a gain to Canada.

The 22 participants in the research are currently employed as faculty members in Canadian universities across the country. They obtained higher education in Mainland China with at least a bachelor's degree before coming to North America for an advanced degree (in many cases both the master's and PhD), and have become citizens of Canada since then. All of them have been living in Canada for at least 10 years. Seventeen participants first came to Canada as private students, and five of them came as government-sponsored visiting scholars before they started to study for a degree in Canada.Data were collected through in-depth individual semistructured interviews, in which the participants shared their personal experiences and perceptions on a wide range of issues associated with brain circulation, including the impact of international learning, the role of higher education in knowledge circulation, transnational migration and identity, related national policies, and brain circulation.

# Findings

# 1.What are the participants roles and contributions to both their host country, Canada, and their birth country, China?

Needless to say, the participants are making a significant contribution to Canada not only as tax payers, but also as highly educated professionals.Meanwhile, they have maintained continuous emotional ties to their birth country.Also, they are more aware of their ethnic identity in Canada as a visible minority than they would have been in China. Some of the participants were guilt-burdened and commented that they were the "cream of the crop'before leaving China and they were also the trusted chosen onesexpected to return to make a difference. One participant recalled that during a briefing session just before leaving China, all of them were reminded of the fact that it took 400 peasants an entire year to produce enough money for them to study abroad for 1 year. In many participants minds, they owe it to their birth country and their people to return. Yet on the other hand, some of them said that staying in Canada actually provided them with more opportunities to contribute to China, in a way that they might not have been able to had they returned to China.

In the economic dimension, many have sent funds back to China on a regular basis and assisted in making business connections.As one participant said:

I have been doing all I can to promote cooperation and exchanges between Canada and China, at the provincial and institutional levels. Though I also have my own research projects, I feel making connections between universities and governments of the two countries has a far more significant impact than conducting the individual research projects, since the international cooperation and exchanges will get more people involved and thus have a far more sustainable impact. (B's responses)

In the academic dimension, many did research related to China's needs in science, engineering, and social sciences.They have also provided support for China through technology transfer and publications. Many of them have received or helped train students from China.Some of them have joint research projects with scholars from institutions in China. With the current Chinese policy such as the "Changjiang Scholar Incentive Program" and the "Program of Academic Short-return for Scholars and Research Overseas, some of the participants also have short-term or honorary affiliations to Chinese universities and therefore have opportunities to lecture and co-supervise students in Chinese universities.

The most significant contribution that has not been well documented is in the areas of cultural and social development. Unlike innovation and technology, sociocultural domains are referred to as "soft areas'and they are often hard to measure.

These domains, however, are most needed as they are key in fostering people's cosmopolitan sensibilities (Rizvi, 2009b) in both societies.

One of the participants key roles is to promote mutual cultural understanding between China and Canada.As Rizvi (2009b suggests, with the increasing global interconnectedness and interdependence of our world, "most of our problems are global in nature requiring global solutions' (p. 253). Understanding cultural pluralism and diversity is therefore very important. International experiences, as Merryfield (2009) found out can greatly enhance people's cultural sensitivity,but international exchanges between China and Canada have been uneven in that each year there are far more Chinese students travelling to study abroad as compared to the much smaller number of Canadian students going to China.As a result, there is a distinct lack of understanding of Chinese society in Canada, just as Weber (2011) found in her study. These Chinese-Canadian professors have actively been involved in numerous activities to promote China in a way that no others are able to do. They often initiated, organized, and participated the following:

i.Organized study tours to China.   
ii. Led exchange programs between China and Canada.   
iii. Published papers, and gave radio talks and public lectures.Some have given lectures about Chinese issues, offering a different view from most of that in the local media.Some have written articles published in major Canadian newspapers,discussing issues of democracy and human rights from a different perspective.   
iv. Helped people to learn more about China through interacting with students, and colleagues and friends in Canada.   
v.Founded the Chinese programs at the universities where they work, or served as head of the local Confucius Institute, a nonprofit public institution aligned with the Chinese government, which is designedto be an important platform to promote Chinese culture and teach Chinese(Yang,2010, p.238),and has contributed greatly to both societies in terms of enhancing the friendship and mutual understanding between China and Canada.

All participants believe that their presence or what they do has influenced Canadian society,"as a member of my own Chinese community(W's response).Some believe that as a person of different cultural backgrounds, they influence their local Canadian communities through the process of "being here,studying here, and working here (W's response).

Although not in China, many have helped develop human capital and capacity for Chinese society.They have given lectures, seminars, and conferences to bring the values that they believe will aid in the development of Chinese society.One participant said that these activities seemed small but would have a gradual and definite positive influence on Chinese society.Another participant shared his experience in a well-known Chinese university when invited to give a talk about the concept of Civil Society. He said that he noticed an obvious desire for change from the scholars and a trend toward a much freer academic environment.

Many professors helped establish training programs not only in science, but also in management and policy studies.Some participants mentioned initiating training workshops in Canadian universities for large numbers of Chinese school principals, visiting scholars, and other education policy makers from China. They believe that these workshops will have a positive impact on China's policy making in the long run. The participants have discussed issues and worked not only with students, especially graduate students, but also with visiting scholars, and government delegations,among whom many are playing an important role in changing and improving Chinese society.

All the participants indicated that as supervisors they have spoken with their Chinese graduate students about how to learn from both societies and to be a better person, and to improve Chinese society in addition to being excellence in the academic areas.Since they have experience and understanding of both societies, that helps avoid bias.One professor stated that it would improve society to find a fine balance between the extreme emphasis on individual rights in the West and the greater emphasis on collective rights in China.More respect for diversity and difference is among the main things that they would like to see happen in China.

# 2.Is effective brain circulation possible? If it is, what stimulates and encourages an effective brain circulation?

In the case of Chinese-Canadian academics, the participants, acting as carriers of knowledge and culture, have proved that indeed there is a brain circulation. However, the effectiveness of this brain circulation will depend on the following factors.

First, the international migration of human capital in the contemporary globalizing world is unprecedented. Scientific and technological development and the increasing global mobility has made the flow of money,ideas, and people much easier, which is one major element that makes brain circulation possible.Some participants mentioned the importance of the use of the internet and other technologies in exchanging the intangible knowledge that is valuable for both societies. It is worth noting that although the participants talked about how academic and cultural exchanges in modern society had made knowledge exchange widely accessible, they also believed that the impact of new technology could never match that of lived international experiences.

Second, this study reinforced the significant positive impact of international experiences on personal ideological enhancement.As we know,international experiences have a positive impact on people's construction of cosmopolitan consciousness (Rizvi, 2009b). As professors, the participants have comparatively more opportunity to pass on their improved perspectives to a wide range of people in both societies.Many commented that before living in Canada, they looked at things and issues from a single "Chinese"perspective. Their "educational experiences in two different educational systems and their life experiences in different societies (H's response) have made them realize and believe that a narrow perspective causes prejudice and unfair judgments. Wider perspectives leads to better decision making, and most importantly can foster understanding, tolerance and inclusion.N, for example, talks about the impact of his international experiences:

I have had many valuable experiences in Asia, African, the Middle East, and North America ...Other than getting a degree, what I learnt most is from all kinds of people with diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

L shares a similar perspective:

The thing that impressed me most was how Canadians perceive education there is no age limit in both undergraduate and graduate study, while in China, there is an age limit, especially for undergraduate study before I came here in 1995. It was very rare that a grey haired lady would sit in the classroom doing her undergraduate degree in China ...I learned more about the cultural differences, and western pedagogy than merely getting a degree.

As university professors, most participants talked about how international experience influenced their teaching pedagogies and enabled them to be more reflective both in terms of teaching and other professional activities. One participant referred to her international experience as "a good mirror to reflect one's own culture and society from the knowledge of other countries and cultures(Y's response).

Most participantsresponses reflected Merryfield's (2009) notion of the significance of cross-cultural experiential learning in cultural learning and in fostering "multicultural and global educators (p. 237).As professors, the participants have more chance to interact in person with students and educators in both countries and thus have more opportunity to "serve as an ambassador to introduce and popularize the culture, pass on the knowledge and help people understand more about both countries (W's response).

Third, the international educational and human capital policies of both governments, the policies and practices of Chinese and Canadian universities, the relationship between the source and receiving countries, and the two countries' levels of economic development have also played an important role in determining the forms and degrees of brain circulation.Though most of the national and institutional policies were driven by economic forces, they have facilitated the circulation of knowledge and culture.

Some participants talked about Canada's and China's national policies in terms of attracting human capital and investing in education. They think China's policy of "encouraging people to go abroad and to return for a short or a long stay to serve the country" has encouraged the circulation of knowledge between China and other countries and has promoted China's national development. The university, as suggested by some participants, is a vital force for "future cooperation or relationship development between Canada and international communities"(Y's responses).Meanwhile, some participants suggested that the positive relationship between China and Canada had made cooperation and exchange between the two nations possible.

Fourth, a few participants talked about the development of China in recent years and thought that this new change had enabled China to benefit more from the international flow of people than it would have in the past.It is interesting to note that China is now beginning to shift into a country that attracts foreign talents.Some participants talked about the increasing number of Confucius Institutes (CIs) that are established all over the world. In fact, by October, 2009, the number of CIs has increased to 375 worldwide (Yang,2010,p.241).As Xu Lin, the director of Hanban(Office of Chinese Language Council International) emphasizes,by establishing CIs, China hopes "to be truly understood by the rest of the world(Yang, 2010, p.238).Previous studies suggest that CIs are not only a platform to learn Chinese language and culture,but also promote friendship and reduce tensions between China and other countries, such as the United States (Li-Hua, 2007). Some participants in this study shared their experiences in CIs and Chinese programs and confirmed the positive impact of CIs on brain circulation.

Finally, the participants emotional ties with both countries also have a positive impact on brain circulation, and make them willing to promote knowledge and cultural exchanges. When the participants responded to the question "Why do you choose to stay in Canada? their perspectives suggested that where people choose to live their lives is more complicated than simple economic gain and pure comfort. It is clear to the authors that this stirred up emotional and social difficulties.The answers ranged from personal, professional, to political. Their answers to the questions of what they valued most for both cultures provided a much better answer to "why they have chosen to stay.For example, D said:

The Canadian values that impressed me the most are freedom in terms of political freedoms, equality as illustrated by things like universal healthcare, equal opportunity in education, etc., and human dignity that people respect one another for who they are.There are various laws and regulations that limit and condemn different kinds of social discrimination.

Most participants thought one important reason for them to stay in Canada was the better research conditions. C said:

Basically, in Canada you actually have more freedom in terms of choosing your research topic and you also get better financial support from the government for your research work. When you have secured income, you can stay focused on your research work.Of course in China you can also apply for funding from government and different institutions, but the whole application process in Canada is generally more open and transparent.

For the participants, although it is never easy to choose to leave one's parents, relatives, and friends behind, it is equally difficult for them to leave a place they call home for most of their adult lives.After living in Canada for all these years, they have developed a strong emotional tie to this country.Meanwhile, they also have a strong bond to their birth country. Some proudly talked about Chinese culture. B said:

The Chinese culture is extensive and profound, and there are so many things that I would like to cherish and spread.Chinese culture advocates a harmonious unification, which can be traced back to Confucianism.We now advocate sustainable development, which is actually a reflection of this conception [harmonious unification]. It has a positive economic, social and environmental impact on the development of individuals, nations and human kind. Take me for example, I have always tried to create a family feel and community atmosphere in my research group.My students and I are more than students and teacher.We are like one big family.

All the participants have indicated that what they have valued most in both cultures has not only helped them to be open-minded individuals, but also the conscious and unconscious goals of combining these values, treasuring them, and passing them on. Their emotional bond to both nations is another essential factor making brain circulation possible.

# 3.What may limit or prohibit an effective brain circulation?

As indicated in the previous section, national and institutional policies and practices are crucial in fostering effective brain circulation.Any problems within the existing policies and social systems, therefore, may constrain brain circulation.

For example, when R talked about why she chose to stay in Canada, she said that after obtaining a doctoral degree in Canada, she was already considered too old to be hired in Chinese universities, since in China there is an age limit for applying for certain positions in universities.

Some participants talked about the fierce competition in Chinese society as well as the downside of an examination-oriented education system, and indicated that was part of the reason they decided to stay in Canada, since their children's education and life are also at the centre of their concerns.

A few other participants talked about the existing problems in China's educational resources/funding distribution system, which has already caused Chinese academic concern (Zhang2011).K for example,considered this maldistribution of education/ research resources as one major factor that prohibits brain circulation.K said,

In Canada, it is more likely that you can have a much more predictable academic career once you get a PhD degree. There are certainly differences between universities, but these differences are minimal compared with the huge difference among different universities in China.Here in Canada,as long as you have a strong academic record, no matter where you get your degree, you may have the chance to work as a faculty member in a university.And no matter what university you are working at, you have the opportunity to get research funding from international or national corporations and organizations, and government, such as NSERC [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council] and SSHRC [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]. But things are different in China.There are big gaps between the top universities and the less prestigious ones, in terms of the resource allocation, quality of teaching and opportunity to get various research funding. In the case of international academic and research cooperation, those less prestigious universities seldom get the chance to work with us [Canadian universities].I feel this will only enlarge the gaps between universities in China, and definitely prohibit a healthy brain circulation from taking place.

K's perspective leads to another question: What is an effective brain circulation anyway? Apparently, one should not reduce it to the knowledge/talent circulation only between different countries.Rather, it should be viewed as a continuous knowledge circulation process among different agencies/regions in the global context.It would not be an effective brain circulation if the knowledge exchange only happens within certain groups of institutions and/or people without the involvement of a larger population. The participants' concern with these disparity issues provides implications for future educational reforms in China.

Although most participants talked about Canadian multiculturalism which respects and celebrates diversity, they also admitted that serious issues of inequality still exist in Canadian society, such as the devaluation of foreign credentials and discrimination against ethnic and linguistic minorities as well as its own indigenous population. Problems such as these also have a negative impact on brain circulation. Just as Koser (2007) said, international migration is "inextricably linked with other important global issues, including development, poverty, and human rights(p.1.

# Conclusion

This article starts with a historical review of the debates over IMHC, followed by sharing the research findings on Chinese-Canadian academics. It argues that brain circulation in the case of Chinese-Canadian academics exists within the context of contemporary global mobility. The participants'responses suggest that they have made significant contributions to both Canadian and Chinese societies in the economic, academic and, more importantly, the sociocultural dimensions. The development of science and technology, the two countries' governmental and institutional policies, the relationship between Canada and China, the levels of development of both countries, and the participants' emotional ties with both countries have made brain circulation possible.

It has to be emphasized here that even if IMHC has the potential to promote mutual understanding among different countries and to construct a global culture and civil society, the notion that the free flow of human capitalwill lead to a global culture and solve all problems is mistaken and trivializes the complexity it entails. Brain circulation in many contexts may just be an ideal outcome of international migration. As Rizvi (2005) argues, the space within which brain circulation takes place is not a neutral one, but is characterized by uneven distribution of opportunities and by asymmetrical flows of power(p.190).Affected by the massive tides of globalization and the uneven distribution of opportunities, the less developed regions are left in a "catch $2 2 '$ position. They have no alternative but to conform to the historical trend of economic globalization, while struggling for better alternatives. Though diasporic networks have contributed to source countries, one cannot ignore the huge benefits that returnees have brought to their homeland.For this reason many developing countries are still making continuous efforts to encourage internationally educated citizens to return. International exchange is definitely necessary, but it would be simplistic to claim that the migration of human capital has either a drain or gain effect for developing countries, nor to simply substitute the concept of brain drain with brain circulation, given the striking disparities in this globalized world.

Finally, both the literature review and the participants'responses have also revealed some problems that have prevented a more effective brain circulation. To choose to stay abroad, although it appears to be a simple choice of lifestyle, actually reflects many complicated economic, political, and cultural issues. Moreover, the disparity issues within the policies and practices of receiving countries have also created further difficulty for an effective brain circulation. Existing literature and the findings of this research reveal that a conceptual analysis of brain circulation is desired. Besides, a more critical analysis of IMHC is crucial since accounting for the disparity issues would be an indispensable step in fostering a more productive and reciprocal brain circulation. To reduce disparity and its effects will demand the efforts of agencies at the local, national, and international levels. The fundamental question now is not to debate whether IMHC is a drain or gain for developing countries, but rather, to find ways to optimize the benefits of IMHC for all regions of the globe.The international migration of human capital, just like globalizationin itself is neither good nor bad but "requires evaluation, not blanket condemnation or uncritical celebration'(Cameron &Stein,2000,p.6).
