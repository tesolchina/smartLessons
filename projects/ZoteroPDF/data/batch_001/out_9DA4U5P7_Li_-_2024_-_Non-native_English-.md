Meta-ethnography

This meta-ethnography synthesises 26 qualitative studies published since 2000 to explore factors shaping NNES students' English academic writing experiences in higher education. The findings reveal that students' writing experiences are significantly influenced by their prior educational backgrounds, current learning contexts, self-perceived writing capabilities, and the strategies they employ to navigate various writing challenges, including a lack of preparedness, insufficient institutional support, and inadequate academic and linguistic competence. The findings also indicate that students' adaptive strategies, such as the use of cognitive, meta-cognitive, and social strategies, play a crucial role in mitigating academic writing deficiencies. The findings underscore the need for higher education institutions to implement more responsive and inclusive support systems that address the cognitive, linguistic, and affective dimensions of students' academic writing endeavours. Drawing upon the findings, a conceptual framework is developed, providing a holistic view of factors mediating students' writing experiences and offering theoretical and practical implications for enhancing educational practices and policies to better support these students' academic endeavours.

# 1. Introduction

# 1.1. English academic writing in higher education (HE)

The mastery of academic writing in English presents asignificant challenge for NNEs students across global higher education institutions (HEIs). The growing prevalence of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) has also underscored the need for empirical insights into how linguistic and cultural backgrounds influence students' academic performance In the context of HEIs, as academic success increasingly depends on proficient writing skill, it is imperative to understand the factors that influence these students writing experiences to support educational stakeholders in creating more effective and supportive learning environments.

The existing literature on English academic writing, particularly focusing on NNEs students, reveals a complex array of developmentaltrajectories of students' writing practices. Prior reviews have extensively explored various dimensions of English academic writing, revealing the inricate interplay of cognitive, cultural, instructional, and inguistic factors that influence students' academic writing experiences. For instance, Cumming e al. (2016) and Dan et al. (2024) respectively explore students practices of writing from sources and lexical bundles utilisation in academic writing. The former review emphasises the developmental trajectory of writing from sources influenced significantly by instuctional quality and students prior knowledge. The latter extends this iscussion to the linguistic fatures of student academic texts, noting a need for a deeper analysis of their genre-specific characteristics. Furthermore, the intersection of technology and English academic writing emerges as a critical area of study, as highlighted in the reviews by Yuvayapan and Yukselir (2020) and Strobl et al. (2019), both underscoring the significant role that digital linguistic devices play in shaping academic writing practices. Yuvayapan and Yukselir explore how academic writers in Turkey utilise corpus-based linguistic tools to navigate between their native linguistic norms and the global standards of academic English, illstrating a nuanced interplay between cultural background and writing practice. Strobl and colleagues, similarl, evaluate digital tools designed to support academic writing, critiquing the overemphasis on lower-order writing kills and advocating for tols that bolster higher-order cognitive skills, such as argument construction. Xie (2020) enriches the discourse by demonstrating the diversity of methodological pproaches to studying authorial evaluation in academic writing, calling for a broader methodological spectrum which expands beyond the predominant corpus-based methods to better capture the subtleties of evaluative language in academic texts.

The current meta-ethnography synthesis builds on these foundational insights by synthesising qualitative research across diverse HE contexts to provide a more integrated understanding of NNES students' experiences with English academic writing. Unlike prior reviews that primarily focused on specific aspects of academic writing or singular student populations, this review extends the discourse y fring a more holistic view of the multifceted xperiences of  students, enapsulating the interplay of educational backgrounds, intitutional context, and personal adaptation strategies. uch a review not onlyfill a critical gap in the literature by synthesising these diverse experiences but also serves as a valuable reference point for future research aimed at enhancing the aca demic writing succes of E students inglobal educational landscapes. This review also translates qualitive findings ino practical frameworks that can guide the development of supportive educational practices, pinpointing areas for improvement in institutional support mechanisms, therey offering valuable insights for HEIsto nhance their trtgie and sensitivity towards the complexities of NNES students academic experiences It is, however, crucial to acknowledge that although this meta-ethnography synthesises a wide range of experiences of HE students engaging in English academic writing across various global contexts it may not capture al intricacie of individual experiences in relatioto r instance, derent type of HE cores ., courework-ntensive versus researchintensive degrees) which ofe offer distinct academic environments and teacher-student dynamics. t is therefore recognised that such variations might influence the academic writing experiences of NNES students and the educational support they receive.

# 1.2. Meta-ethnography

Meta-ethnography, developed by Noblit and Hare (1988), isa structured, rigorous qualitative evidence synthesis methodology that enables comprehensive interpretation and integration of findings across multiple qualitative and ethnographic studies. Unlike other synthesis methods which may merely summarise or aggregate findings, meta-ethnography delves into the interpretative layers of research. Through constantly comparing and analysing findings acros studies, meta-ethnography allows researchers to uncover \*analogies btween accounts" while preerving he uniqueness and holism characteristic of qualittive studie, and eentually derive "substantive interpretations" (pp. 9-10) that could depict a fuller picture of the investigated phenomena.

Given its interpretive nature, meta-ethnography is idelly suited for exploring complex phenomena such as lived experiences as it facilitates the construction of new conceptual understandings from existing literature. In the context of this study, using metaethnography could articulate a nuanced narrtive that captures the intrcacies of NNES students' experiences navigating English academic writing practice. By synthesising qualitative research, this study moves beyond merely summarising findings to developing a deeper, interconnected interpretation of how contextual, educational, and personal factors shape students academic writing practices.

# 1.3. Study aims

This meta-ethnography study synthesises qualitative findings of NNES students' experiences with English academic writing in HE. It aims to generate a more comprehensive understanding of these experiences, identify key factors influencing them, and explore how these factors interact and collectively shape students' writing practices.

# 2. Method

This study comprised three primary stages: systematic literature search, quality appraisal, and literature synthesis. To ensure inter. rater reliability an invited coder (heein referred to as IC), an expert in language education and qualitative evidence synthesis, joined the quality appraisal and literature synthesis stages. The reporting of this study follows the eMERGe meta-ethnography reportig framework (France et al., 2019).

# 2.1. Systematic literature search

The literature search was conducted across digital databases including Web of Science, ERIC, Scopus, and Google Scholar, supplemented by snowballing methods. The search strategy employed the SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) tool (Cooke et al., 2012) detailed in Table 1. The "Design" category was intentionall omitted to avoid inadvertently excluding studies using unconventional qualitative designs or methods. Specific search terms were refined following a preliminary scoping search on Google Scholar, which helped identify commonly used keywords in similar studies.

The author began the preliminary search by querying the four databases, which yielded 9013 records. After removing duplicates and screening the tites and abtracts, 91 studies were demed potentill relevant. Subsequent full-text reviews based on inclusion criteria (see Table 2) narrowed this to22 studies. After that, snowbaling methods were tilised to amplify the earch reults, including forward search (identifying studies which cite the selected articles), backward search (identifying studies cited by the selected articles), and targeted search (searching articles published in relevant journals). This process brought the total to 26 studies for quality appraisal. The systematic search wascomplete in June 2024 and the procesisillustrated in Fig. 1, fllowing the PRIsMA 2020 flow diagram of article selection process (Page et al., 2021).

# 2.2. Quality appraisal

The CASP checklist (CASP, 2018) was used to facilitate the asessment of the methodological rigour of the included studies, but we did not create umerica scores for theasesment as the checklist might not full eflect reearh qualit (Morrs et al., 2022). The aim for this process therfore shifts to identifying and prioitising conceptull richer studies (Pollard et a., 2020 that could contribute to the meta-thnography. Hence, ollowingMorrs et a. (2022) and Pollard et al. (2020), the included studies were classfied as key if they were conceptuall rich regarding their methodological information, dat collected, and findings; satisfactory f they contained less detiled methodological description and/or a slimmer body of data but til had the potential to contribut to the synthesis; and \*fatally flawed if they had significant methodological flaws or missed essential methodological details, and would hence be excluded Consequently, 7 studies were identified as \*key' and 19 as "satisfactory", with no studies excluded as fatally flawed.

# 2.3. Study characteristics

Following Morris et al. (2022), the author extracted and documented descriptive characteristics from each study, including research aims, desigs, theoretical frameworks, contexts, participant profile, and data collection and analysis methods. A summary of study characteristics is presented in Table 3.

# 2.4. Meta-ethnography synthesis

The synthesis of selected studies followed the steps outlined by Noblit and Hare (1988), Morriset al. (2022), and Pollard et al. (2020), mainly including closely reading each study, identifying and extracting second-order constructs from individual studies, analysing the constructs and translating studies into one another, and synthesising the translations into a coherent narrative.

First, the author and IC thoroughly red all ncluded studies to fully grasp their ore contents. Next, to asses inter-rater reliabilit, they independently extracted second-order constructs (themes or concepts developed by the original authors) from a subset of 5 key papers. The two sets of extractions were then compared and discussed regarding differences in data extraction approaches. This process was then expanded to all 26 studies, with the extracted constructs organised in Microsoft Excel along with descriptive notes on their relevance to the study topic. Following individual extractions, the author and IC compared and contrasted the two sets of extractions discussed differences, and refined the constructs and descriptive notes. Consequently, 154 s-order constructs were developed for the translation process The author then began to translate the studies into one another, with key studies translated firstfollowed by satisfactory ones. In this step, the author utilised the constant comparison method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to perform pairwise comparisons between second-order constructs from the studies, grouping related constructs into conceptual categories, with constant reference to descriptive notes and original artice. These categories were iteratively refined into third-order constructs, representing the research team's interpretation of the synthesised data. IC then checked the developed third-order constructs and discussed and refined them with the author. During this phase, we identified and excluded 3 untranslatable second-order constructs due to their abstract nature. Consequently, 151 s-order constructs were synthesised into 10 third-order constructs, capturing distinct yet conceptually interrelated aspects of students' writing experiences.

The final stage involved discussing the relationships within and between diffrent levels of constructs to determine the synthesis approach: reciprocal (where findings of the studies are comparable and/or could add up to each other) rfutational (where contradictory findings were identified by different studies), and/or line-of-argument synthesis (where the third-order constructs could be arranged in crtain order to enable the reerchers to gnerate a more omprehensive understanding and therfore nfer afuller picture of the phenomenon studied). Consequently, we agreed that the 10 third-order constructs were sequenced to form 4 higher-order constructs, demonstratig a line-of-argument narrative of student writing experiences. Table 4 presents the synthesis and indicates each individual study's contribution to the third- and higher-order constructs.

that students' writing experiences are shaped by their previous educational experience, current learning contexts, self-perceived writing-related capabilities, and strategies employed to tackle writing challenges.

# 3.1. Feeling unprepared

Our findings suggest that students writing practices were greatly influenced by their previous learning experiences. The synthesis indicates that many NNES students fee inadequately prepared by their previous education systems for the demands of English aca demic writing in their current HEIs. This unpreparednes also had a negative influence on students understanding f academic writing norms and expectations, which further hampered their academic performances.

3.1.1 Lacking Preparedness. Students across multiple studies reported a significant lack of preparedness for English academic writing. A notable factor is the deeply ingrained writing habits from their first language (L1) backgrounds. These habits often lead to challenges when adapting to writing tasks in a second/foreign language (2), primarily due to insufficient practice and exposure to L2 writing conventions (Eldaba & Isbll, 2018; Fajaryani et l., 2021). The divergence in academic conventions and schemata between their L1 and L2 academic communities further exacerbates this ssue (Gao, 2012; Mehar ingh, 2016). In some students' L1 learning context, rote learning was oten prioritised over the development of critical thinking skill (Ahmed, 2024; Othman & Lo, 2023). This contrasted with the expectations of English academic writing, which emphasises logical coherence and critical analysis rather than merely \*syntactical and grammatical correctess (Wang & Parr, 2021, p.6). Beginner L2 writers frequently atempted to generalise their previous writing experiences into English academic writing (Ghanbari & Salari, 2022; Kaufhold, 2015); however, due to the incompatibility between their L1 and L2 academic conventions, they often encountered difficulties, which further impeded their performance. This lack of preparednes could aso cultivate students negative atitudes toward their current academic writing tass as they struggled to reconcile these conventional differences (Altinmakas & Bayyurt, 2019).

3.1.2 Lacking Understanding. Inadequate exposure to L2 practices not only left students feling unprepared but also significantly limited their understanding of English academic writing (Junina et l., 2022; Wan, 2014). This oten resulted in students uncertainty about the expectations when tasked with Englishessay writing (Ghanbari & Salari, 2022). Academic writing is a complex processthat demands a blend of cognitive and linguistic abilities to synthesise information, construct arguments, and present ideas precisely and logically (Hamp-Lyons & Jin, 2022; Hyland, 2004). However, the synthesis indicates that students often posessed a rigid and partial understanding of academic writing. For instance, Ma (2018) found that students conceived of English academic writing merely as a "form of advanced general English" characterised by certain \*surface features' (p. 85) like complex vocabulary and grammar. This perception seemed profoundly influenced by their previous learning, where lexical and grammatical aspects of L2 were often overemphasised. Aditionally, Altimakas and Bayyurt (2019) reported students' conception of the "rule-bound nature' (p.94) of aca demic writing, indicating their interpretation of esay writing as strictly adhering to predefined structures. Such rigid interpretations often restricted their writing flexibilit, impeding the development of more sophisticated writing skill. Furthermore, Ma (2021) noted that NNEs students' inadequate understanding of English academic writing stemmed from their limited L2 learning experiences in native English-speaking (NES) educational contexts, which hindered their aility to grasp the conventions and expectations established by the native communities.

# 3.2. Feeling under-supported

Within students' current HEIs, continuous institutional support becomes essential for their further development of academic repertoire For academic writing, such support mainly encompasses tailored EAP training sessons and learning resources provided by their institutions, and instruction and fedback from disciplinary tutors on writtentasks. Despite institutional support's significance, however, the synthesis indicates that students frequently found the support they received inadequate for completing their written assignments.

# 3.2.1. Lacking institutional support

In addition to the inluence of previous educational experiences, students understanding and performance in English academic writing are significantly shaped by the educational resources available at their current institutions (Morton et al., 2015). While students may fel satisied with their subject-mater courses, which enhance their disciplinary knowledge and skills (Ma, 2018), they often reported a lack of suficient intitutional support for developing their English academic writing skill (Bakhou & Bouhania, 2020; Jomaa & Bidin, 2017; Junina et al., 2022). In some instances, even when institutional writing courses were provided,students expressed concens over the inffectivenes of thee coures, aributing this to the instructional strategies and the content delivere, as a student in Mukminin et al. (2015, p. 1401) explained:

I think some lecturers underestimate this skill [writing]. They just asked the students to write without understanding what are the goals .. the lecturer did not explain [teach] very well. I want lecturers that guide me step by step in writing that makes me more understand about what we should do first in writing.

Further compounding these challenges are reports of inadequate institutional resources, such as proofreading and editing services (Jeyaraj e l., 2022; Morton et al., 2015), and acces to library resources and leaning platorms (Rnuma, 2023; Subandowo & Sadi, 2023).

For a more effective writing lening experience, students expressed a need for constant and targetd instiutional training from the beginning of their study (Jeyaraj et a., 2022; Rahnuma, 2023; Subandowo & Sardi, 2023), such as a genre-based EAP writing course, which could better prepare them for diffrent types of written assgnments (Ma, 2018). Similarly, Gupta et al. (2022) noted the importance of a CLIL (content and language integrated learning)-alike training that integrated general language skills and discipline-specific knowledge, which could better facilitate students in raising their \*language awareness in the particular academic discipline'" (Rahnuma, 2023, p. 10).

# 3.2.2. Teacher influence

The synthesis indicates that students' academic writing experiences are significantly influenced by their interaction with their disciplinary teachers (Wang & Parr, 2021), as well as the teachers' expectations (Altinmakas & Bayyurt, 2019) and feedback (Ma) 2021; Morton et al., 2015) on their writing performances. While some studies highlighted effective teacher support on students writing performance (Morton et al., 2015; Wang & Parr, 2021), most reported a range of negative experiences that students faced. Feedback quality is critical aea of concern. Although students recognised the value of teacher feedback in leaning academic writing, the feedback they received was often perceived as negative (Altinmakas & Bayurt, 2019), unconstructive (Junina et al., 2022), and inadquate (Mehar Singh, 2016) failing to provide cler guidnce on their progres and areas for improvement. dtionall, feedack was sometimes belated, exacerbating students' anxiety due to tight assignment deadlines (Gupta et al., 2022).

Ineffectie teacher support was also reflected in the clarity of asignment instructions. Students relied heavil on cler guidance for writing academic essays due to their limited understanding of English academic writing norms. However, the instructions they received were often vague or implicit (Mehar Singh, 2016; Wu & Buripakdi, 202) leading to call for more articulated expectations from their teachers (Gupta et al., 202; Rahnuma, 2023). Challenges were further compounded when students were assgned unfamiliar topics (Fajaryani et al., 2021; Gao, 2012) or were expected to write at a native speaker level (Xing et al., 2022), causing additional dificulty and anxiety in their writing practices. These observations suggest teachers lack of understanding of their students background and learning progres (Maringe & Jenkins, 2014). Also, Mukminin et al. (2015) noted that in certain contexts where a higher teacher-student power distance existed, students were often discouraged by such imbalanced dynamics from seeking support from their teachers.

# 3.3. Feeling incapable

The synthesis reveals that NNEs student ften feel incapable of their English academic writing due to insuficient prior learning experiences and inadequate institutional support. These students typically struggle with a limited base of integrated academic skills and related linguistic capabilities.

# 3.3.1. Lacking integrated academic competence

Across the studies, there is a consistent depiction of NNES students grappling with the integrated academic competencies essential for proficient English academic writing. This multifaceted challenge spans cognitive and writing skill, disciplinary knowledge, and critical soft sils such as time management. Many students exhibited substantial deficits in fundamental writing sills including initiating, constructing, organising, and synthesising ideas (e.g., Altinmakas & Bayyurt, 2019; Mehar Singh, 2016; Wan, 2014). For instance, Ahmed (2024) and Wu and Buripakdi (2022) highlighted students ssues with initiating ideas for their written assgnments, with Gao (2012) suggesting that these issues could stem from linguistic diffrences and varying rhetorical expectations between students L1 and L2 practices. This lack of coherence in constructing and developing ideas consistently undermined students ability to produce academic texts. The synthesis also revealed a recurrent theme of students issues with critical thinking and argumentation (Ahmed, 2024; Fajaryani et al., 2021). Students struggled to demonstrate crticality in their writing, influenced partly by cultural factors sch as respet for athrity, whch might ihiit ther willines to criticlly engg wth txts or expres disenting opinions (Othman & Lo, 2023). Challenges in adopting appropriate academic stances and generating coherent, persuasive arguments further compounded their writing dfficultie (Jomaa & Bidin, 2017; orton e al., 2015). Another critical deficiency identified was students struggle to generat and apply disciplinary knowledge in their writing practices, which was reflected in their difficlties in locating credible sources for ther asignments and articulating knowlege authoritatively in ey writig, mpairing their bilit to establish a convincing academic identity (Jomaa & Bidin, 2017; Morton et al. 2015). Lastly, effctive time management emerged as a significant challenge, exacerbating the complexities of academic writing tass. Students often struggle with balancing their studies and various commitments, leading to stress and dificulty meeting tight deadines (Subandowo & Sardi, 2023; Wu & Buripakdi, 2022)

# 3.3.2. Lacking linguistic competence

Our analysis reveals that insufficient linguisic competence represents a significant barrier to academic writing for NNES students. This pervasive challenge manifests in various aspects, notably through deficiencies in vocabulary and grammar (Ma, 2021; Mehar Singh, 2016), which directly impact the students ability to form sentences and construct arguments Junina et al., 2022). Fajaryani et al. (2021) and Wu and Buripakdi (2022) further noted that these deficiencies went beyond merely limited vocabulary and grammar;, they criticlly undermine the clarity and coherence expected in academic writings. Compounding the isue of vocabulary and grammar is the ifficult in translating thoughts from students L1 into English. While students could concetualise and frame their ideas in their L1, they struggled when expressing these ideas in English (Junina et al., 2022; Ma, 2021). Ths processoften resulted in a los of the original meaning and reduced clarity and coherence of the wrtten work (Gupta et al., 2022). Furthermore, students' transition be. tween the linguisic and rhetorical conventions of L1 and L2 posed additional challenges. Ma (2021) found that differences in writing norms across languages led to inappropriate word choices and awkward sentence constructions, which ofen made the texts appear disjointed or stylistically inconsistent.

The psychological impact of these linguistic challenges was also noted across studies. Students faced considerable anxiety, which was exacerbated by pressure from English-speaking peers in their learning contexts (Eldaba & Isbell, 2018). This stress was also sometimes magnified by perceived prejudices against NNES, diminishing their onfidence in their writig abilities and impacting their academic self-esteem (Maringe & Jenkins, 2014; Wu & Buripakdi, 2022). Such resulting lack of confidence significantly influenced their writing speed, adding another layer of difficulty to completing academic tasks under time constraints (Ma, 2021).

# 3.4. Self-regulated adaptation

The synthesis indicates that students have developed various self-regulated writing strategies to mitigate deficiencies in writing skills and tackle the above-mentioned writing challenges. Four primary trategies were identified across studies, including cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies, social strategies, proactive strategies, and avoiding pitfalls.

# 3.4.1. Cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies - recurrent practices

The synthesis highlights that NEs students frequently employed a variety of cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies to navigate the complexities of academic writing. Central to these strateies was their recurrent nature. Students consistetly engaged in recurrent writing practices that not only refined their writing but also deepened their understanding of academic norms (Subandowo & Sardi, 2023). Students often began their writing by repeatedly reading and interpreting assignment intructions to ensure a solid grasp of the academic rules specific to each task (Eldaba & Isbell, 2018). Qian and Krugly-Smolska (2008) emphasised that planning was apivotal initial strategy, where students carefully developed writing plans that outlined their approach to the assignment. In this proces, students actively utilised brainstorming to outline their ideas and structural plans for their essays (Fajaryani e l. 2021), laying a coherent framework for their arguments. The act of writing was viewed by students as a developmental and recursive process of discovery, where they generated and organised ideas through a dynamic back-and-forth motion in their drafts (Wan, 2014). This notion was reinforced by Wang and Par (2021), who described the writing proces as inherently recursie, involving repeated cycles of writing and revising. They further noted that although this proces could be painful due to constant scrutiny and correction, it was also acknowledged by students as a critical path to improving writing skills.

Following the conceptualisation phase, students might also engage in rigorous meta-cognitive strategies such as self-editing and revision (Fajaryani et al. 2021). Such practices not only enhanced the quality of their writing but also fostered a deeper elf-awareness of their earning processes. Collectively, these strategies form a comprehensive approach by which NNES students strive to meet the demanding requirements of English academic writing, illsrating a proactive and iterative engagement with learning and development.

# 3.4.2. Social strategies - seeking support

The synthesis reveals that NNES students also employed a variety of social strategies to cope with writing challenges by seeking support from diffrent social sources, primarily including their tutors, institutional services, and peers. Students proactively communicated with their academic tutors and utilised available institutional writing support teams to navigate the challenges of academic writing (Wu & Buripakdi, 2022). Such communication enabled students to grasp a clearer understanding of writing expectations from their tachers (Altinmakas & Bayyurt, 2019) and academic writing conventions (Eldaba & Isbell, 2018). However, previous discussin revealed that institutional support often fell short of students needs (see Section 3.2.1). This lack of sufficient institutional suport compelled students to see altenatie sources of assistance. Consequenty, they tuned to their peer, especially senior students within the same disciplines (Ahmed, 2024; Gupta et al., 2022). Such per interactions prove beneficial in helping students navigate writing challenges and gain more accessible and timely fedback (Junina et al., 2022; Xing et al., 2022). These interactions sometimes would xtend to sharing writing difficulties (Fajaryanie l., 2021) and engaging in peer-review sessions where feedback was exchanged in a supportive setig (Rahnuma, 2023). Apart from these benefits, Wang and Par (2021) further noted that peer interactions made students' writing experiences more enjoyable and lessened the isolation often felt during the writing proces.

# 3.4.3. Proactive approaches - seeking external resources

The analysis indicated that students also employed proactive strategies to tackle writing challenges by actively seeking external resources. This approach involved a deliberate and strateic use f resources to addres specific writing difficulties. Students tapped into a variety of resources, from academic vocabulary banks and grammar textboos to online tutorials (Subandowo & Sardi, 2023; Wu & Buripakdi, 2022; Xing et a., 2022). For instance,students often utilised reading materias from institutional repositories (Wu & Buripakdi), open-acces journals (Subandowo & Sardi, 2023), and journal articles' reference lists (Wan, 2014) as effective starting points for identifying valuable writing aids. Moreover, students often employed these resources as models for imitation in their writing practices (e.g., Eldaba & Isbell 2018; Ma, 2018; Qian & Krugly-Smolska, 2008), which functioned as a form of learning that helped them internalise the elements of effective academic writing. However, as Ahmed (2024) cautioned, this imitation strategy required careful handling to avoid plagiarism, particularly when students' paraphrasing skills were underdeveloped.

Apart from simply mimicking writing models, some advanced students engaged with these reading resources through what Wang and Parr (2021) described as "dialogical reading and writing" (p. 6). This involved reading articles related to their writing topics, comparing these with their own writings, and reflecting on these comparisons to generate new ideas or improve their argumentative structures. This method enhanced their content knowledge and helped them develop a critical perspective of academic writing. Technology also played a significant role in these strategies, where students used tool ike spl and grammar checkers to help them refine the technical accuracy of their writing (Wu & Buripakdi, 2022). Collectively, by carefully leveraging these resources, students enhanced their academic performances and developed a significant level of agency and resourcefulness in their learning.

# 3.4.4. Avoiding pitfalls

In their endeavour to overcome academic writing challenges, students not only adopted the above self-directed strategies but also engaged in practices specifically aimed at avoiding pitalls that could expose their academic and linguistic shortcomings. This approach, while mentioned lessfrequently in the studies, represents a critical aspect of students' adaptive writing strategies. For instance, students consciously avoided using complex words and sentence structures beyond their comfortale command of L2 (Wu & Buripakdi, 2022). The translation of ideas from L1 to English was a contentious strategy among students. Whil i could serve as a helpul tool to formulate intial ideas, it sometimes became a pitall due to students inadequate linguistic competencies (see section 3.3.2). Consequently, some students choseto avoid writing in their 1 and then translating into English, as this processcould introduce grammatical and stylistic inaccuracies typical of translated texts (Eldaba & Isbell, 2018). Qian and Krugly-Smolska (2008) noted students' mixed feelings about this strategy. While i sometimes provided students with a necesary scaffold for expressing complex ideas, it could also disadvantage them by leading to bizarre or incorrect expressions.

In sum, thesestrategies of avoiding pitall underscore a defensive but trategic dimension of NNES students approach to academic writing. By carefully sidestepping areas where their weaknesses might be most visible these students manage to produce work that better adheres to the expectations of academic English, albeit sometimes at the expense of a richer linguistic expression.

# 4. Discussion

In this section, key findings of the meta-ethnography synthesis regarding factors influencing NNES students' English academic writing experiences are first summarised. Based on the findings, theoretical implications and suggestions for future reearch are then proposed, followed by a discussion of practical implications regarding how HEIs can better prepare and support their students in effectively developing academic writing skills.

# 4.1. NNES students' English academic writing experiences

The synthesis of the 26 studies reveals a complex interplay of various factors that significantly impact regarding factors influencing NNES students English academic writing experiences in HEIs. These factors are multifaceted, encompassing previous and current educational experiences and contexts, self-perceived writing-related capabilities, and the strategies employed to navigate writing challenges. One of the most prominent findings from the synthesis is the lack of preparedness among students, which stems largely from the discrepancies between the academic norms and practice of their L1 and those expected in English academic contexts (Ma) 2021). This unpreparednessis not merely manifested in students' ineffective inguisic transitions but is also characterised by their struggles in adapting to new academic conventions and expectations (Altinmakas & Bayyurt, 2019), which significantly influences students' confidence and overallacademic performance. Furthermore, the synthesis highlights significant gap in the intutional support available to these students, with substantial reports on receiving inadequate guidance and resources from thir institutions, further hindering their continuous writing skilldevelopment (Junina et al., 2022). The quality of instructional support, including the effectiveness of teacher fedback and the relevance of writing training offered, is also frequently called into question (Gupta et al. 2022). Students experiences suggest a need for talored academic writing support that ddreses both linguistic competencies and the understanding of academic conventions in the L2 contexts (Ma, 2018).

The emotional and psychological dimensions of students writing experiences also emerge as crucial themes in the synthesis. Many students face considerable anxiety and a lack of confidence, exacerbated by their perceived linguistic inadequacies and the academic pressures asociated with writing tasks (Maringe & Jenkins, 2014). This emotional burden can significantly inluence their engagement and suces in academic writing, suggesting the need for more comprehensive support systems that adress both the cognitive and affective challenges faced by these students.

In response to these challenges, the students have been found to employ a variety of self-regulated learning strategies to manage their writing tasks. These primarily include cognitive and metacognitive strategies that help them plan, organise, and revise their writings (Qian & Krugly-Smolska, 2008; Subandowo & Sardi, 2023), and social strategies such as seeking fedback from peers and instructors (Eldaba & Isbell, 2018). Moreover, students often utilise extenal learning resources like academic vocabulary banks, grammar textbooks, and online tutorials to bolster their writing skils (Wu & Buripakdi, 2022; Xing et al., 2022). These strategies indicate a high level of adaptability and resilience among NNES students as they navigate the complexities of academic writing i L2.

Based on the findings, the author developed a conceptual framework (Fig 2) to illustrat the multifaceted and interrelated factors that shape NNES students' English academic writing experiences. This model underscores how students' background factors, such as prior educational experiences and cultual influences, fundamentally shapetheir integrated academic sils and inguistic competence. These capabilities are also cultivated by the academic environments they currently navigate, characterised by varying degrees of institutional, instructional, and social support. Adaptive strategies serve as crucial mediators that students employ to mitigate insufficient instructional support and individual academic capabilities, further facilitating their navigation of academic writing. Th interplay between different components in the frameworkillustrate not only the direct influences but also the feedback loops where experiences in academic writing can lead to adjustments in strategies and shifts in capabilities, highlighting the ongoing, reciprocal nature of learning and adaptation in academic contexts. Thus, the framework captures th essence of the interconnectednes and the continuous evolution of factors that influence NNES students' writing experiences, offering a more holistic view of the academic landscape they encounter.

# 4.2. Implications for future research

The development of the conceptual framework (Fig. 2) from the synthesis provides a foundation for identifying several vital avenues for future research aimed at enhancing students academic writing experiences. Understanding the intricate interplay between cultural and educational backgrounds and English academic writing is essential. Future studies should further explore how NNES students L1 writing norms and pedagogical experiences influence their transtion to L2 academic environments. Such research could inform moreffective, culturally responsive educational strategies that acknowledge and integrate the diverse linguistic backgrounds of students (Li, 2024). By examining specific cultural influences on writing strategies, educators can tailor their pproaches to better meet the needs of these students, thereby improving their academic outcomes.

The role of psychological factors in academic writing suggests a significant area for investigation. Anxiety and confidence levels notably affect NNES students writing experiences (Eldaba & Isbell, 2018); therefore, reearch focusing on interventions that address these psychological elements could provide insights into enhancing student well-being and writing performance Studies could explore the effectiveness f counselling, workshops, and other support mechanisms that aim to reduce axiety and boost academic confidence among these students.

Comparative studies involving both NNEs and native English-speaking students could also provide valuable insights. Since academic writing challenges are not exclusive to non-native speakers (Ma, 2018), understanding these challenges from a broader perspective could help distinguish between difficulties related to language proficiency and those inherent to academic writing per se. Such comparisons might reveal underlying academic isues that afect allstudents, thereby informing more comprehensive educational reforms.

The impact of technological advancements on academic writing also warrants further exploration. As digital tools become incresingly inta int ctionl praties, i is crucil to as w he tls afet stt wting oeses (Wen & Walters, 2022). Research in this area could guide the development of digital resources that support academic writing, while also highlighting potential pitfalls associated with their use.

# 4.3. Implications for educational institutions

The findings from our synthesis also underscore the necessity for educational stakeholders to reevaluate and enhance the support systems available to NNES students in HE, particularly in the realm f academic writing. To address the identified gaps in the education and support systems efectively, acomprehensive and integrated approach is required. EMI institutions should prioritise the development of pedagogical support talored specifically for NNES students. This could include training educators to recognise and effectiely addressthe unique inguistic and cultural challenges these students fce (Li, 2024). By integrating specialised training programs focused on constructive feedback techniques and cultural sensitivity, teachers can better support NNES students in developing their writing skills, thereby reducing writing anxiety and enhancing overall academic performance.

There is also a critical need for institutions to establish or enhance academic writing centres that offer dedicated support for their students. These centres should provide resources such as workshops and one-on-one tutoring specifical designed to address writing challenges faced by these students. Such talored support could sigificantly boost students confidence and competence in academic writing. Institutions should also implement mechanisms to continually asses the efectivenessof these support services. Regular feedback mechanisms and action research can provide insights into the efficacy of current support structures and highlight areas needing improvement. This ongoing assessment will enable institutions to adapt their strategies to meet the evolving needs of their students.

To further embed writing kills development in the educational experience f NNES students, curricula acrossall disciplines should integrate targted writing skils traning (Guptat al., 2022). This would ensure that students engage with academic writing not only in language-focused courses but throughout their disciplinary learning. Moreover, leveraging technology, such as digital toos, peer review platorms, and access to extensive online research resources could complement traditional teaching methods and provide students with the necessary resources to reinforce their autonomy in ther academic practices (Jeyaraj e al., 2022). Last, fostering an inclusive academic environment that values inguisic diversity involves recognising thestrengths that multilingual students bring into the academic setig (Li, 2024). Encouraging practices that alow students to utilise their multilingual repertoire in ther academic endeavours can enhance understanding and creativity, ultimately enriching the learning experience forall students. By adopting these strategies, educational stakeholders can create a more supportive, effective, and inclusive learning environment for students. These proactive approaches could not only address the immediate needs of NNEs students but also contribute to a broader institutional commitment to diversity and inclusion, leading to enhanced academic outcomes for all students.

# 5. Conclusion

This meta-ethnography has synthesised qualitative findings from 26 empirical studies to present a comprehensive view of the academic writing experiences of NNES students across various HE contexts, forming a coherent synthesis that captures the multifaceted nature of these experiences. The study reveals that NNES students experiences are significantly shaped by their prior educational backgrounds, the academic and linguistic expectations of their current institutions, and their personal engagement with the writing process. The findings contribute to the fields of L2 education, pecifically L2 writing education, by providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between educational background, institutional support, and individual strategies in English academic writing. The findings also add to the existing litrature by illustrating the complex, dynamic nature f language learning and academic integration faced by NNES students. Moreover, the development of a conceptual framework (Fig. 2) based on the synthesis not only aids in identifying these interrelations but also facilitates pinpointing areas of English academic writing that merit further investigation. The findings also underscore the necessity for educational stakeholders to adopt more tilored approaches to support these students. By highlighting the specific writing challenges faced by NNEs learners, this study paves the way for future educational practices to explore innovative trategies and interventions designed to enhance the academic writing capabilities of this significant student population.

As noted by Morris et al. (2022), the trustworthiness of the synthesis findings i significantly dependent on the studies included. In this study, the exclusion of non-English literature may have led to a somewhat narrow understanding of the global context of English academic writing among NNES students. Future studies should therefore consider including literature in multiple languagesto capture a more comprehensive global perspective, which would further enhance the understanding of cross-cultural educational dynamics in L2 writing. Additionally, the focus on NNE students' experiences, while shedding light on specific challenges faced by this student demographic, may fail to allow for a comparative analysis with NES students, who may also face similar or distinct challenges in academic writing in their L1. Future research could benefit from a comparative approach that includes both NNES and NES students writing experiences. This could help delineate pecific chllenges related to academic competence from those universall faced by all students, thus informing more targeted educational strategies. The limitation to higher education contexts of this synthesis might also restrict the relevance and applicaility of it indings to other educational stages. Future syntheses could expand the scope to include different educational stages, which could provide insights into the development of writing skill over time and acrosdifferent educational transitions. Last, as pointed out previously, while this study provides a more comprehensive synthesis of the factors influencing NNES students academic writing experiences, the author acknowledges the limitations inherent in representing the full spectrum of HE contexts. For instance, the type of HE courses - ranging from coursework-heavy programmes with hight student-to-teacher ratios to research-intensive degres with close mentoring - may critically shape these experiences. uture research should consider these contextual variations to enhance understanding of how diffrent educational settings specificall affect academic writing practices. Such investigations could lead to more tailored educational support strategies, accounting for the unique demands of diverse academic environments.
