# Abstract

Collocation is an aspect of language generally considered arbitrary by nature and problematic to L2 learners who need collocational competence for effective communication. This study attempts, from the perspective of L2 learners, to have a deeper understanding of collocational use and some of the problems involved, by adopting a task based approach, using two highly comparable corpora based on the writing of Hong Kong ESL and native-speaker British students. Results of the study indicate that the performance of the Hong Kong students in collocational use might be adversely affected by their L1, L2 as well as their inadequacy in the lexis and grammar of the target language. Findings of the study suggest the need for a broader view of collocational knowledge and a pedagogical approach to the learning and teaching of this aspect of L2. The implications for teaching English in general and English vocabulary in particular are also discussed in detail.

# 1. Introduction

Bolinger’s view that ‘language does not expect us to build everything starting with lumber, nails and blueprint, but provides us with an incredibly large number of prefabs’ (Bolinger, 1976, p. 1) has been gaining growing acceptance. Prefabs of this kind refer to language units such as words, collocations and idioms. The argument further developed from this view is that ‘as they (idioms) loosen up, they gradually fade into the background of phrases that can be generated by rule (p. 5)’. That is to say, units of language may be viewed along a continuum of idiomaticity, ranging from units completely free to those totally fixed in terms of syntax and from units which are transparent to those which are obscure in terms of meaning.

This idiomatic view of language has been supported by findings of studies on language processing (Becker, 1975; Pawley and Syder, 1983) and corpus studies (Sinclair, 1987; Renouf and Sinclair, 1991; Altenberg, 1998). Indeed, the use of prefabs in text is so pervasive that Sinclair (1987) put forward the ‘idiom principle’ to explain the way in which meaning arises from text. By idiom principle is meant ‘a language user has available to him a large number of semi-preconstructed phrases that constitute single choices, even though they might appear to be analyzable into segments’ (p. 320). Indeed, there are tens and thousands of language units of various degrees of fixity and transparency along the continuum of idiomaticity discussed above and these units are becoming more and more important in language and language teaching.

# 1.1. Collocation

The term collocation has been labeled in a variety of ways e.g. prefabs, multi-word units etc. and defined in different manners in both linguistics and language teaching. The only consensus, as Nesselhauf (2005, p. 11) pointed out, is that collocation refers to ‘some kind of syntagmatic relation of words’.

Gitsaki (1999), in this regard, reviewed in meticulousness the three main approaches to collocations: lexical, semantic and structural. The lexical approach was based on the idea of word meaning at the lexical level first proposed by Firth (1957). One often quoted example is that one of the meanings of ‘night’ is its collocability with ‘dark’, and one of the meanings of ‘dark’ is its collocability with ‘night’ (p. 196). Halliday et al. (1964) explained collocation as the tendency of a lexical item to co-occur with one or more words. Sinclair (1966, p. 411) focused on the likelihood of co-occurrence but admitted that ‘there are virtually no impossible collocations, but some are more likely than others’. Sinclair (1991, p. 170) went on to define collocation as ‘the occurrence of two or more words within a short space of each other in a text’ and distinguished the ‘significant’ (i.e. frequent) collocations from the ‘casual’ (i.e. infrequent) ones. Collocation has thus become a merely statistical matter. Unlike the lexical approach, the semantic approach perceived the meaning of a lexical item as the semantic properties of that item. That is to say, it is the semantic properties of a lexical item that determine its collocates (Chomsky, 1965; Lyons, 1977; Katz and Fodor, 1963; Lehrer, 1974; Cruse, 1986). This approach, as Gitsaki (1999, p. 15) commented, cannot explain the large number of idiosyncratic co-occurrences that are arbitrarily restricted.

While the lexical and semantic approaches focused only on lexical words, the structural approach took into consideration both lexical and grammatical collocations. The BBI Combinatory Dictionary (Benson et al., 1997) defined collocation as words which ‘regularly combine with certain other words or grammatical constructions.’ Eight categories of grammatical collocations and seven categories of lexical collocations were identified. Grammatical collocations consist of ‘a dominant word – noun, adjective/participle, verb – and a preposition or a grammatical construction’, and lexical collocations have structures such as ‘verb $^ +$ noun, adjective $^ +$ noun, noun $^ +$ verb, noun $^ +$ noun, adverb $^ +$ adjective, adverb $^ +$ verb’. The structural approach is by comparison more pedagogical as it takes into account collocation of not only lexical but also lexical and grammatical words.

# 1.2. Collocations and L2 learners

The importance of collocational knowledge in L2 competence is beyond dispute. It enables the learners to speak more fluently, makes their speech more understandable and helps them write or sound more native-like (Pawley and Syder, 1983; Hunston and Francis, 2000; Wray, 2002). However, learners’ problems with L2 collocational use have been repeatedly reported regardless of their level of language proficiency, for examples, Fan (1991) on secondary students, Biskup (1992) on advanced learners, and Farghal and Obiedat (1995) on university students. One of the difficulties lies in the idiosyncratic nature of collocational use. For example, while ‘strong’ has the same meaning as ‘powerful’ in ‘a strong/powerful argument’, ‘powerful’ collocates with ‘car’ but ‘strong’ collocates with ‘tea’ (Halliday, 1966, p. 160). Another difficulty arises from the fact that collocational use may be markedly different among languages. Wray (2002) observed that ‘in English you run a business, but in German you lead it. . . In English you smoke a cigarette, but in Hindi you drink it. . . In English you lie in the sun, but in Russian you lie on it (p. 73)’. Similar to the learning of many other aspects of L2, the biggest problem is the lack of exposure to the target language. Whereas native speakers acquire the knowledge of collocation subconsciously and gradually as they grow up in their speech community, most learners, especially those who learn the L2 only in the classroom environment, do not have this opportunity.

# 1.3. Studies on L2 collocations

Studies on L2 collocations may broadly be divided into two main categories. One used elicitation techniques and the other production data (Nesselhauf, 2005). Elicitation techniques employed by the former ranged from translation tests (Marton, 1977; Biskup, 1990, 1992; Bahns and Eldaw, 1993) to cloze (Herbst, 1996; Shei, 1999; Al-Zahrani, 1998), multiple choice (Fayez-Hussein, 1990; Arnaud and Savignon, 1997), blank-filling (Aghbar, 1990; Aghbar and Tang, 1991) and grid (Channell, 1981). The major limitation of this category of studies is that they required learners only to produce single collocates of particular words and thus findings of these studies failed to reflect the actual performance of learners in L2 collocational use. The other category gave learners the opportunities to produce multi-word collocations of their own in writing tasks. This category included studies which looked at the collocations used by L2 learners in their writing (e.g., Chi et al., 1994; Lombard, 1997), and those which compared the performance of L2 learners to that of native speakers (e.g., Fan, 1991; Granger, 1998b; Lorenz, 1999; Howarth, 1998; Kaszubski, 2000; Zhang, 1993).

In most cases, the investigations into L2 collocations were narrowed down to collocations of particular structures. For examples, Bahns and Eldaw (1993), Al-Zahrani (1998), and Howarth (1998) examined verb $^ +$ noun collocations, Fan (1991) and Chi et al. (1994) looked at delexical verbs, and Granger (1998b) and Lorenz (1999) studied the adverb $^ +$ adjective collocations. Findings of these studies, therefore, were only related to a particular type of L2 collocation and it was not possible to have a deeper understanding of L2 collocational use.

As regards studies which used huge corpora for the comparison between the native and non-native speakers, the analysis was mainly quantitative where lexical collocations that occur at very low frequencies were totally neglected (Granger, 1998a). Also, in these studies, the production data of the two groups was not based on specific writing tasks but merely on similar types of writing (e.g. argumentative or narrative), the topics of which might vary considerably. It was therefore not possible to have tight control over the content and, closely related to it, the language used by the two groups. Accordingly, the comparability of the production data in these studies may be open to question.

# 1.4. The present study

The present study was an attempt to better understand the competence in L2 collocational use of the ESL secondary school leavers in the HK context by looking at their actual performance in a writing task, deploying two highly comparable native and non-native corpora. Another uniqueness of the study was that instead of investigating a particular type of collocation, it examined the collocational use of the two groups as generated by a specific writing task. Since the size of the corpora was relatively small, not only quantitative but also qualitative analysis could be conducted.

As the present study aimed at investigating collocations from the perspective of the L2 learners, collocation was operationally defined as the co-occurrence of 2 or more words within a short space of each other in a sentence context, involving lexical and grammatical words. The linguistic elements in the collocation were compatible in that when these elements were used together, they formed a kind of syntagmatic relation that was acceptable in English and relevant to the context in which the collocation was used, contributing to the meaning of the written text. The study, therefore, examined collocations of different degrees of fixity and transparency in syntax and in meaning. Collocations of a wide range of collocability restriction and frequency were examined. It was hoped that such a loose definition of collocation would help to gain a deeper insight into general L2 collocational use and some of the problems involved.

# 2. Methodology

This is an exploratory study based on a native corpus and a non-native corpus compiled from a portion of the writing of 60 Hong Kong and 60 British students in a previous study of the researcher.

# 2.1. The corpora

The 60 Hong Kong essays were provided by the Hong Kong Examinations Authority and they were written by candidates composed almost entirely of Cantonese speakers. They all attended the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) in the same examination centre. The allocation of candidates in every examination centre was arranged in such a way that candidates in each centre would include learners of mixed ability. The sample collected can therefore be considered representative of the average performance of Hong Kong secondary school leavers, who have studied the English language for about 11 years. The 60 British essays were collected from a comprehensive school in northern England where an essay competition was especially set up for the purpose of comparison between the two groups. Three classes of students from Year 10 of the school, a total of 60 native speakers of English, were invited to take part in the competition. The age of both groups was about 15–16. They were required to do exactly the same writing task i.e. reporting a crime to the police in about 300 words based on a series of four pictures. For the present study, to establish the tightest possible control over the production data, the corpora were created based solely on the language used in describing just ONE picture as shown in Fig. 1 above. This picture was selected because it is simple and factual, and does not contain many cultural elements. The language data in the two corpora for the present study were therefore highly comparable as both groups used the same genre (i.e. narrative) in their writing to do exactly the same task (i.e. describing one and the same man).

# 2.2. Data analysis

The corpora were worked on with ConcApp (Greaves, 2005), a free concordancer, which is a simple tool sufficient for the purpose of the study. In order to better understand L2 collocational use, data analysis began by identifying all the lexical words (i.e. noun, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) before looking at how these words were used together or how they collocated with the grammatical words. In the analysis, collocation was identified as the co-occurrence of words in the 24 characters of context (span) either side of the keyword (node), which might be a lexical or grammatical word, within the context of a sentence. In the identification of adjectival collocations, both attribute and predicative collocating adjectives were examined. The investigation into adverb $^ +$ adjective collocations mainly focused on intensifiers.

The study began with the assumption that L2 learners’ collocational use is different from that of native speakers, and the focus of analysis was on language that was overused, under-used or not used by the L2 learners compared to that of their British counterparts, which served as the norm in the study. The production data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively whenever it was necessary to do so. This study, strictly speaking, did not adopt a statistical-quantitative approach in that no statistical tests were used to find out ‘significant’ differences between the two groups because the main concern of the study was pedagogical. Indeed, in the discussion on learner corpora, Granger (1998b) remarked that ‘the notion of statistical significance should be weighed against that of pedagogical significance (p. 16)’.

# 3. Findings

This section will begin by reporting the preliminary findings which are related to the vocabulary used by the two groups in their writing before focusing on the L2 collocational use of the Hong Kong learners under study. Preliminary analysis of the data showed that the British students used more types (unique words) and tokens (words in total) than the Hong Kong students in describing the ONE picture selected for the purpose of the study as shown in Table 1.

Such findings are by no means surprising as the British students used L1 while the Hong Kong learners used L2 in the writing task. To provide an overview of the differences between the two groups, Table 2 below is a summary of the top ten nouns, adjectives, verbs and intensifiers (types) in the two corpora in terms of frequency of occurrence.

In general the two groups used more frequently nouns and adjectives than verbs and intensifiers. As revealed in the table, nearly half of the types in the two corpora were similar, which is easy to understand because the two groups were required to do exactly the same task. Nevertheless, Table 2 shows quite clearly that the frequency of use of nouns, adjectives, verbs and intensifiers was on the whole higher in the British corpus than that in the Hong Kong corpus, accounting for the findings presented in Table 1. Indeed, only three intensifiers (types) were found in the Hong Kong corpus compared to the wide variety of types in the British corpus.

There were three exceptions where the frequency of use was greater in the Hong Kong corpus by comparison: ‘face’, ‘fat’, and ‘very’. Closer examination of the data revealed that the HK learners tended to use more general and simple words instead of specific ones. For example, while ‘cheek’ did not occur in the Hong Kong corpus at all, the word ‘face’ was used as many as 54 times by the Hong Kong learners to refer to both the cheek and the face of the man in the picture. Similarly, ‘moustache’ occurred 55 times in the British corpus (35 times as shown in the table plus 20 times with deviant spellings as a result of the confusion between American and British English) but did not occur at all in the Hong Kong corpus where ‘beard’ was used 8 times and ‘hair’ 2 times to refer to the moustache of the man in the picture. As for the intensifier, it was interesting to note that the Hong Kong students seemed to have a preference for the amplifier ‘very’ while the British students the downtoner ‘quite’.

All the above findings suggested that the HK learners were, on the whole, weaker in vocabulary compared to their British counterparts. The following will focus on their L2 collocational use.

# 3.1. Fewer collocations and more restricted range of collocates

It was quite obvious that the HK learners used fewer collocations and an extremely restricted range of collocating words compared to the British students as summarized in Table 3 below.

Table 3 lists in detail the adjectival collocations of the top ten target nouns (types) used by the two groups. Both the one adjective and multi-adjective collocations have been included. As indicated in the table, no collocations were used by the Hong Kong learners concerning nouns they did not know e.g. ‘cheek’ and ‘moustache’. On the other hand, for the collocations used by both groups, fewer single or multi-word adjectival collocations were found in the Hong Kong corpus than in the British corpus in general, especially in the cases of ‘hair’, ‘man’ and ‘scar’.

There was clear evidence that the Hong Kong learners used a highly limited range of collocating words compared to the British students. For example, the item ‘fat’ was used as many as 21 times together with ‘man’ in the Hong Kong corpus but it was only used once in the British corpus where ‘man’ was otherwise used together with ‘chubby’, ‘plump’, ‘well built’ and ‘short and stocky’. For another example, while a wide range of collocates of ‘hair’ were found in the British corpus e.g. ‘unkempt’, ‘dark’, ‘greasy curly’, ‘scruffy looking’, ‘curly and untidy’, the range of collocates in the Hong Kong corpus was much smaller by comparison. The item ‘short’, for example, was repeatedly used by the learners instead. Indeed, the use of a restricted range of collocating words was best illustrated in the case of ‘scar’ in Table 3 where only one collocating word (type) ‘long’ was found. Surprisingly, the other collocating words used by the British students with ‘scar’ such as ‘large’, ‘big’ and ‘deep’ were words also known to the Hong Kong learners but were not used by them in collocation e.g. ‘large scar’.

Actually, the overuse of simple collocating words was also noted among the use of intensifier $^ +$ adjective collocations in the Hong Kong corpus. As reported in Table 2 earlier, the amplifier ‘very’ was used 15 times in the HK corpus but only 7 times in the British corpus. It was uncovered that ‘very’ was used repeatedly by the Hong Kong learners mainly with the adjectives ‘big’, ‘fat’ and ‘short’. On the other hand, in the British corpus, most of the intensifiers were used, interestingly, as downtoners, yielding vivid collocational expressions. For instance, the man was depicted as ‘fairly chubby’ or ‘rather chubby’; he looked ‘slightly Spanish’; he was ‘a bit dodgy/shorter’; and his accent was ‘just normal’.

Notes: 1. The number in the bracket indicates frequency of occurrences. 2. Comparative adjectives in the two corpora were found as there were two thieves in the series of pictures and only one of the thieves was in the picture selected for the writing task. 3. For the item ‘neck’, all the premodifications were in the form of the determiner ‘his’.

# 3.2. Collocational use adversely affected by L1

Table 3 also provides some evidence of L2 collocational use affected by L1. Regarding the item ‘face’, more collocations seemed to occur in the Hong Kong corpus such as ‘left/right face’, ‘left side face’ or ‘left half face’. Nevertheless, they are not acceptable expressions in English and their use may result from the word for word translation of the Chinese collocations. Similarly, the negative effect of L1 was strikingly revealed in the use of ‘circle’ in various examples in the Hong Kong corpus e.g. ‘circle eye’, ‘his hair was circle and short’, ‘a circleshape jade’, ‘a face like a circle’ etc. Such use of ‘circle’ might be explained by the fact that ‘round’ and ‘circle’ are expressed by the same lexical item in Chinese. L1 influence was also noted in the use of collocating prepositions. For example, it was found that as many as 20 out of the 28 instances of ‘around’ in the British corpus were used in the expression ‘wearing. . . around his neck’ but only 2 instances of similar use were found in the Hong Kong corpus. Subsequent investigation into the use of ‘neck’ in the Hong Kong corpus (a total of 14 occurrences) revealed eight instances of ‘wearing. . ... on his neck’, a collocational use acceptable in Chinese but not in English.

# 3.3. Collocational use affected by confusion with L2

There was also some evidence of deviant collocational use resulting from the learners’ confusion with the English language. For example, as regards the collocation ‘curly hair’ in Table 3, the Hong Kong learners seemed to be confused by L2 pronunciation e.g. ‘cury hair’, ‘curley hair’ or, they might have confusion with the loose synomyns in English e.g. ‘curve’, ‘coil’ and ‘curvy’. All these words share a common semantic component ‘round/not straight’ with ‘curly’, but none of them are used together with ‘hair’ among the native speakers of English. The instance of ‘upper mouth’ is a good example of the learners’ confusion with the collocational use of ‘lip’ and ‘mouth’.

# 3.4. Collocational use hampered by deficiency in $L 2$ grammar and lexis

Many of the examples discussed so far have at the same time revealed that the Hong Kong learners’ collocational use was severely restricted by their deficiency in the knowledge of vocabulary and grammar of the English language. This may further be demonstrated by an interesting example in the Hong Kong corpus with the intended meaning ‘there was a scar on the left hand side of his face’ or ‘the man had a scar on the left hand side of his face’:

had some damage in his face by left hand side   
in his left hand-side with his face   
in the left of his face   
has a wound in his left side of his face   
on his long [left] hand face and on left hand size [side] of his face with harm on his right-hand side the face   
on his left side face   
have a bare [beard], at left of face have a mark

These and similar instances of use demonstrated quite convincingly that the learners attempted to express the intended meaning as stated above but encountered various difficulties. They might not know the item ‘scar’ and had to resort to ‘hurt mark’, ‘harm’ and ‘damage’. They could not use accurately the lexical collocation ‘left hand side’ They showed confusion in the use of the collocating preposition ‘on’ in ‘on the left hand side’ and they might have some problem with another collocating preposition ‘of’ in ‘on the left hand side of his face’. In contrast, it was noted in the course of investigation that the British learners, in as many as 23 instances, used ‘down’ in the prepositional phrase postmodifying ‘scar’ i.e. ‘down his left cheek’ and ‘down the left hand side of his face’, showing not only accurate but also vivid collocational use.

Indeed, some collocational use involving both lexis and grammar which occurred in the British Corpus did not occur at all in the Hong Kong corpus. For example, it was found that there were 6 instances each of ‘look’ and ‘looking’ and 24 instances of ‘looked’ in the British corpus but only one instance of ‘looked’ in the HK corpus. Further investigation of the data uncovered that as many as 12 instances of ‘looked like’, 3 instances of ‘looked as if’ and one case of ‘look as if’ were used by the British students e.g.

. .looked as if he had a cut down the. . . . .looked as if it had been broken. . . .a pendant that looked like a ring . . .a pendant on it that looked like a round ring. . .

As both groups of students were required to report in writing what they perceived based on a picture only, there was the need for both groups to express a sense of uncertainty in describing the appearance of the man. However, it seemed that the Hong Kong learners did/could not use ‘look like’ or ‘look as if’ although they could produce expressions such as ‘a face like a circle’ as reported earlier, which indicated that they understood the meaning of such use. They might have difficulties with the complexity of the syntax involved in such use.

# 3.5. Informal collocations

Finally, it should also be reported that some informal collocations found in the British corpus were totally absent in the HK corpus e.g. ‘kind of’ and ‘sort of’

. .was wearing some kind of necklace.   
. . .necklace on with a ring of some kind on it   
. . .noticed a sort of chain. . . ....a funny sort of chain. . .   
. . ..or pendent of some sort

Such collocational use, like the intensifier $^ +$ adjective collocations mentioned above (e.g. ‘a bit doggy’), contributes to the sense of nativeness in English, of which the HK learners seemed to be completely unaware.

To summarize, findings of the study have shown that the Hong Kong learners under study were much less competent than their British counterparts in vocabulary knowledge. Accordingly, they tended to use fewer collocations as well as a highly restricted range of collocating words. Indeed, similar findings were also reported in, for examples, Kaszubski (2000), Lorenz (1999), Granger (1998a) and Chui (2006). Moreover, in the use of L2 collocations, the Hong Kong learners seemed to be adversely affected by their L1, supporting the results of studies on non-Hong Kong learners (e.g., Al-Zahrani, 1998; Bahns, 1993; Biskup, 1992; Farghal and Obiedat 1995; Howarth, 1998; Nesselhauf, 2005). They also might be negatively influenced by their confusion with the L2 spelling, pronunciation or loose synonyms, which is in agreement with the findings in, for examples, Blum and Levenston (1978) and Howarth (1998). The native speakers’ use of informal collocation was also reported in De Cock et al. (1998). All the above suggests that the present study has produced a lot of results consistent with those of many past studies. The most valuable findings of the study are those which allow us to gain insight into the complicated problems in L2 collocational use attributable to the learners’ inadequacy in the knowledge of both the lexis and grammar of the target language. Such problems have rarely been investigated or reported in past studies. Their revelations have been made known by the attempt of the present study to look at collocations from the perspective of L2 learners, with a focus on the collocational use naturally generated by the specific writing task rather than a particular type of collocation.

# 4. Pedagogic implications

Based on the above findings, several important practical implications for teaching will be discussed in detail in this section.

# 4.1. Vocabulary knowledge and collocational use

The knowledge of L2 collocations is, to a considerable extent, related to the knowledge of L2 vocabulary. As collocational use of language involves knowledge of words and the company they keep, it is reasonable to assume that the more L2 vocabulary a learner has acquired, the more collocations he is likely to know or use. If learners do not know ‘moustache’, their knowledge of ‘thin moustache’ would virtually be non-existent. Similarly, if learners do not have good knowledge of a wider range of collocates, they are bound to rely heavily on a small number of simple items such as ‘fat’ and ‘very’ in collocational use, producing language which is monotonous and repetitive. In some cases, learners may know all the words in the collocation e.g. ‘deep’ and ‘scar’ but they may not have knowledge of the collocation ‘deep scar’ and are not able to use it in production. To achieve competence in L2 collocational use, learners need to develop a wider vocabulary and knowledge of collocations.

# 4.2. Teaching L2 collocations

Since collocational use is not rule-governed and, in most cases, arbitrary and idiosyncratic, it is important for teachers to raise the awareness of L2 learners to this problematic aspect of language. A direct and simple way to do so is to begin by raising the learner’s awareness of collocational use in their L1. As Cook (1999, p. 191) put it, ‘language teaching is concerned with developing an L2 in a mind that already contains an L1’. For example, teachers may make up deviant L1 collocations and ask the learners for their acceptability.

To address the problem of negative L1 transfer, it is paramount to draw the learners’ attention to L2 collocational use different from that of their L1 whenever necessary e.g. the acceptability of ‘left cheek’ but the unacceptability of ‘left face’; the acceptability of ‘wearing. . ... on his neck’ in Chinese vs the acceptability of ‘wearing. . .. . . around/round his neck’ in English. With such awareness, learners will be more sensitive to L2 collocational use in reading or listening, and may be more ready to use more collocations in speaking or writing. This is consistent with the ‘noticing’ hypothesis, which emphases the importance of consciously attending to and identifying the language input (Schmidt, 1990, 1994).

To minimize the adverse effect of learners’ confusion with L2, vocabulary should be taught in collocational contexts. For example, in the teaching of synonyms, the different senses of words may best be distinguished by the collocational contexts in which they are used. The sense of ‘curly’, ‘curved’, ‘curvy’ and ‘coiled’ may effectively be clarified by the respective companies they keep as in ‘curly hair’, ‘curved blade’, ‘curvy red lips’ and ‘coiled snake’. For another example, in the teaching of ‘lips’, ‘upper lip’ and ‘lower lip’ may simultaneously be introduced to avoid confusion in collocational use. Collocational contexts help to establish the meaning of words and at the same time contribute to the knowledge of L2 collocations.

In the learning of L2 collocational knowledge, teachers may encourage learners to develop the skill of chunking. Ellis (2001) defined chunking as ‘the bringing together of a set of already formed chunks in memory and welding them together into larger units’ and it is ‘a basic associative learning process which can occur in all representational systems’ (p. 40). In the present study, the L2 learners had tremendous difficulty in using, for example, ‘on the left hand side of his face’, which is a simple and readily available expression to native speakers of English. If a chunking approach is adopted in the learning process, learners may begin by chunking up ‘left’ and ‘hand’ to acquire the collocation ‘left hand’. When ‘left hand side’ is learnt, ‘left hand’ is already an old chunk in the learners’ memory and does not require much processing effort and learners may then focus on the bigger chunk. This, however, does not suggest that collocational knowledge is acquired mainly by rote learning.

In a study on the effect of L2 on L1, Laufer (2003) found that the decline in L1 collocational knowledge was dependent on the length of residence in the L2 environment. These findings imply that exposure to L2 is essential to its acquisition. In this regard, native speakers and L2 user corpora are especially useful for the learning of collocations. The former provides the standard norm and the latter affords a standard and plausible model. Concordances allow learners to learn not only in real contexts but also in multiple contexts. Teachers may also create the needs for using newly introduced collocational knowledge in the classroom. Wray (2002, p. 25) observed that ‘ the more often a string is needed, the more likely it is to be stored in prefabricated form to save processing effort, and once it is so stored, the more likely it is to be the preferred choice when that message needs to be expressed’. The activities designed should be genuinely communicative (both written and spoken) and psychologically authentic, focusing on everyday events that generate repeated collocational use (Gatbonton and Segalowitz, 1988). It is only through repeated encounters and use in communicative activities that receptive knowledge of collocations will develop into productive knowledge and learners may gradually build up confidence in L2 collocational use.

# 4.3. A pedagogical approach to L2 collocations

Results of the present study call for a pedagogical approach to the learning and teaching of L2 collocations, which is also relevant to the teaching of English in general and English vocabulary in particular. Such an approach implies an understanding and a belief in the idiomatic view of language which raises doubts as to ‘whether even those expressions that we take to be freely generatable may be infected with the idiomatic virus’ (Bolinger, 1976, p. 5). It focuses not only on words in isolation but also on the using together of lexical words, or lexical and grammatical words in teaching. Most importantly, it advocates the teaching of grammar in the teaching of vocabulary and vice versa. For example, to enable learners to communicate effectively, the teaching of ‘look li $\mathbf { \tau } _ { \mathrm { { c } } } + \mathbf { N P } ^ { \prime }$ and ‘look as if $^ +$ Clause’ may be as important as that of the single-word item ‘look’ denoting ‘turn the eyes so as to see something’. Similarly, in addition to teaching ‘down’ as the opposite of ‘up’, the other meanings of the same item may best be learnt in collocational contexts such as ‘the scar down the man’s face’. As Kennedy (1990) rightly pointed out, collocations are where grammar and vocabulary teaching meet.

The most practical implication of this pedagogical approach is that teachers should not be restrained in their teaching by the neat and tidy definitions or labels of collocations that have been put forward by different schools of linguists. While it is important to teach, for example, collocations which are ‘more restricted’ or which occur ‘more frequently’, teachers should have confidence in focusing on collocational use they see as relevant to the making of meaning in a particular context, taking into account the language needs of their students irrespective of whether such use concerns only lexical words or both lexical and grammatical words. Nobody understands the needs of L2 learners better than their teachers. Ellis (2001) contended that ‘learners do not care about the units of language as long as they map onto accessible meanings (Peters, 1983)’. If we accept this pedagogical view of collocational knowledge, many collocational sequences are important for teaching in view of the actual needs of the L2 learners.

The present study has raised a side issue which is related to the learning goal. Should learners be expected to use collocations in exactly the same way as native speakers? Wray (2002) pointed out that collocational competence is closely related to the identity of the speakers and therefore an integral part of the native language. On the other hand, Cook (1999) questioned the use of native norm as the goal of language learning and argued that L2 speakers can never or rarely become native speakers. Findings of the present study suggest that deviant L2 collocational use is a matter of degree, ranging from the rather odd ‘curvy hair’, ‘upper mouth’, ‘left half face’ to the more intelligible ‘wearing. . . on his neck’. While teachers may need to discourage L2 collocational use that is totally unacceptable to the native speakers, they should, in setting the learning goal, meet the actual needs of the learners. For instance, if the focus of learning is on written English, knowledge of informal collocational use such as ‘kind of’, ‘a bit of’ or ‘sort of’ may not be of prime importance.

# 5. Conclusion

This exploratory study has provided some valuable evidence that learners encounter various kinds of problems in L2 collocational use involving not only lexical but also grammatical words. It is the task based approach of the present study and the close comparability of the two corpora compiled that have made it possible to uncover the complexity of the difficulties concerned, particularly those related to the learners’ deficiency in the grammar and lexis of the target language. Results of the study suggest a pedagogical approach to L2 collocations, which calls for a broader view of collocational knowledge, taking into account the basic language needs of L2 learners. This approach may be of interest to teachers and applied linguists who have relentlessly been exploring various ways and methods to enhance the learning and teaching of a foreign or second language, about which we still have a lot to learn.
