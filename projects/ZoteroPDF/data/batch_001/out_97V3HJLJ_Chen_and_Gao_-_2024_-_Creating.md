# ABSTRACT

While the importance of the peer feedback in second or foreign language (L2 or FL) classrooms in higher education has been increasingly recognized, empirical research on discussing peer feedback literacy from the perspective of community-based academic writing is very much in its infancy. Informed by the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, this qualitative study aims to explore learners’ feedback practice and their perceptions of providing peer feedback in an online community-based academic writing task. The analysis was based on multiple sources of data (pre-task surveys, online community-based feedback entries, post-task stimulated recalls, in-depth group interviews, and follow-up WeChat interviews) from 31 Chinese undergraduates. The results indicated that although students provided feedback with different focuses, they valued online community peer feedback over traditional peer feedback for seeking affective appropriateness, facilitating social interaction, and seeking better practice. Additionally, students considered online community peer feedback practice could help with finding the reviewers’ own voices through different stages of reflective knowledge building processes, and transferring to subsequent revisions. This study provides pedagogical implications for how a community-based approach to online peer feedback can enhance students’ academic writing practice.

# 1.  Introduction

Peer feedback as an instructive and interactive activity has proliferated in second language (L2) or English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms in higher education over the past decades (Lundstrom & Baker,

2009; Min, 2006). In recent years, peer feedback has been particularly enriched with the new affordances presented by e-learning technologies (e.g., Ma, 2020). Emblematic of a shift from product-oriented to process-oriented writing approaches, research on peer feedback has primarily focused on how feedback receivers benefit from and engage with peer feedback in enhancing revisions or subsequent writing (e.g., Gao et  al., 2019; Han & Hyland, 2015). Given that peer feedback is a two-way process (Van Popta et  al., 2017), the current literature has shed light on learning opportunities peer feedback offers for providers, such as enhancing genre awareness (Berggren, 2015; Yu, 2021), improving L2 learners’ self-efficacy (Lee & Evans, 2019), and providing insights into the cognitive processes when students construct feedback reviews (Nicol et  al., 2014). Such information is of significant value for the discussions on the learning potential gained through providing peer feedback (Nicol, 2009).

Previous research has explored peer feedback from the provider end (e.g., on essay writing: Berggren, 2015; on thesis/dissertation writing: Yu, 2021 ) as well as its influencing factors (e.g., Van Popta et  al., 2017). However, the studies have typically operationalized peer feedback giving in pairs or small groups of typically three to four learners (e.g., Liu & Hansen Edwards, 2018). Scant attention has been paid to peer feedback giving in online community-based contexts, where feedback is openly shared among multiple peers, necessitating increased opportunities for social interaction among feedback providers (for a rare exception see Zhang et  al., 2018). Given that learning is a socially mediated process (Vygotsky, 1978) and learners’ ability in social interaction has a direct influence on their ability for constructing knowledge through self-reflection (Garrison et  al., 1999; Ma et  al., 2017), it is important to examine how the increased opportunities for interaction are perceived by peer reviewers and whether they could lead to improved cognitive thinking on the provider end. Drawing on a community of inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison et  al., 2010; Hilliard & Stewart, 2019), the present study aims to explore EFL learners’ practice and perceptions of community peer feedback giving in a blended academic writing course in a Chinese university. As a framework dedicated to online learning, CoI focuses on social knowledge construction through the interaction between three conceptual elements–teaching presence, social presence and cognitive presence (Garrison et  al., 2010). In particular, CoI emphasizes the unique affordances of an online learning community in the construct of social presence, which is composed of open communication, emotional expression and group cohesion (Garrison, 2017; Garrison et  al., 1999). It is thus a suitable framework to guide our investigation into online community-based peer feedback giving practice, which centers on the open sharing of feedback practices and the cognitive, affective, behavioral, and socio-interactive impact it brings forth. Our theory-based inquiry could contribute to the literature of peer feedback by explaining learners’ perceptions of community-based feedback through the interactions among the cognitive, social, and teaching presences. Furthermore, our inquiry may provide useful implications for EFL and L2 writing teachers and educators on how to facilitate students’ peer feedback practice with a view to enhancing learning gains and writing development in online community-based contexts.

# 2.  Conceptual framework

# 2.1.  Understanding community-based approach to peer feedback

Community-based peer feedback is referred to variously as “group peer reviewing” (Berggren, 2015, p. 58), “multi-peer feedback” (Schunn & Wu, 2019, p. 13), and “multiple peer review” (Cho & Schunn, 2007, p. 418). However, these conceptualizations have generally emphasized the access to more sources of information on the receiver end to the neglect of the open communication (not only between the providers and receivers but also among the providers themselves) and the learning opportunities it brings forth. We thus define community-based peer feedback as an activity system where feedback practices are shared openly among multiple peers that form an effective and professional classroom community. It is typically enabled by such technologies as dedicated software systems (e.g., Cho & Schunn, 2007; Nicol et  al., 2014; Yang, 2011) or comments on wiki docs (e.g., Ma, 2020), forum posts (e.g., Wu et  al., 2015), and blogs (e.g., Ciftci & Kocoglu, 2012).

To date, while developing a community-based language learning environment is essential, the subject has so far remained understudied (Ma, 2020). Of the limited research that involved the idea of peer feedback as a community-based approach in face-to-face contexts, Zhang et  al. (2018) explored the effects of a group $( N { = } 7 )$ of Master’s students’ peer feedback on three students’ thesis revisions. Other than face-to-face community learning contexts, Ma (2020) investigated how students provided and perceived inter-group peer feedback on wiki writing. Although these studies exemplify different forms of community approach to peer feedback practice, they have a universal feature that the feedback is provided (individually or jointly) by multiple learners and the feedback practice is openly shared in the community. With the increasing recognition of the essentialness of developing a community of critical inquiry for EFL and L2 writing (Hilliard & Stewart, 2019), it is meaningful to deepen our understanding of students’ feedback practice through a systematic investigation of the community-based approach.

# 2.2.  A community of inquiry perspective on peer feedback

Developed from the domain of online and blended learning, CoI is concerned with multidimensional relationships and dynamic interactions among elements (e.g., teacher, learner, environment) when learners engage with others in order to integrate new knowledge with their existing knowledge (Garrison et  al., 1999). As a theory emphasizing successful online learning experience through creating a community (Garrison et  al., 2010), CoI has a strong explanatory power on how learners observe, reflect on, and engage in text-based conversation (e.g., Yang, 2011). Influenced by Vygotskian notions focusing on regulations and the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) (e.g., Vygotsky, 1978), writing research views peer feedback as a process of social participation where students enter the writing communities with the help of feedback from peers (e.g., Ede & Lunsford, 2011; Hu, 2005). Thus, investigating peer feedback from the lens of CoI can shed light on “pedagogy as a way to understand both how and what writing students learn” (Hilliard & Stewart, 2019) in community-based online peer feedback practice.

This study is based on a refined CoI model that is situated in the context of the community-based peer feedback-giving activity (see Figure 1). The original CoI model typically describes how effective learning is gained through the educational experience that occurs at the intersection of social, cognitive and teaching presence for a group of individual learners (Garrison et  al., 1999, 2010).1 The definitions of the CoI model include three components essential to an educational transaction: cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence (Garrison et  al., 1999, 2010). In the following, we explain how the theoretical framework of our study is based on and modified from these three elements.

Informed by CoI, community-based peer feedback giving experience is conceptualized as a mediated collective activity system in communities where the three indicators of effective affordances are interrelated. Teaching presence is defined as the ways in which teachers facilitate discussion and provide feedback that clarifies ideas and promotes learning (Garrison, 2017). It provides an active and student-centered learning environment (Hilliard & Stewart, 2019) where writers can develop metacognitive awareness (Garrison, 2017) and monitor their writing through metacognitive instruction (Lee & Mak, 2018). In the specific context of community-based peer feedback giving, teaching presence includes design and organization (e.g., online peer feedback module and grading rubric), facilitating discourse (e.g., examples teacher provided for peer feedback giving practice), and direct instruction (e.g., teacher-required in-depth, specific feedback assignment).

Figure 1. A model for online community-based peer feedback giving (based on Garrison et  al., 2010).

Cognitive presence refers to the learning and inquiry process, which can be analyzed through four phrases of thinking process: “triggering event” (e.g., a peer review task); “exploring the relevant information” (e.g., explore what the assignment is about); integrating ideas (e.g., enable multiple rounds of cognitive processing) and finding out solutions (e.g., transfer to subsequent revision of own work). We define cognitive presence in community-based contexts as constituted by written discourse from multiple peers. Therefore, this framework is at an advantage for multiple perspectives of ideas gained as sources for multiple rounds of self-reflections (i.e., before, during and after peer feedback giving), during which metacognitive awareness is developed as students reflect on their beliefs about their feedback giving experience and their identities as feedback givers (Sommers, 2011).

The third component of the CoI model is social presence, which often refers to a student-centered online environment (Swan et  al., 2009) that encourages open communication, emotional expression and group cohesion (Garrison, 2017). It has to be noted that “open communication” in community-based contexts has its own features; namely, the interaction is primarily through asynchronous, written discourse with asymmetric anonymity among the presence of multiple feedback givers and one anonymous feedback receiver. Given that learners feel aware of the other people in the communication (Lomicka & Lord, 2012), “expression of emotion” in this study refers to feedback givers in the search for affective appropriateness in the community through comparison with peer feedback givers’ practices. More importantly, social presence emphasizes “developing sufficient trust to facilitate genuine negotiation” (Hilliard & Stewart, 2019). Feedback givers need to build “group cohesion” (e.g., finding one’s own voice; probing for affective appropriateness), so that feedback givers can balance between rapport and criticalness within the community.

Overall, our revised CoI model with a direct focus on the interactions between teacher presence, social presence and cognitive presence within the context of the community-based peer feedback giving activity is able to highlight how EFL and L2 learners as agents in regulating themselves for creating a purposeful online feedback giving learning community.

# 2.3.  Student perception and the focus of peer feedback in EFL and L2 academic writing

Learners’ perceptions are often associated with their perceptions of themselves, defined as the way students understand themselves (Williams & Burden, 1999) and of the learning situation, that is, how students understand the classroom and the instructor’s behavior (Brown, 2009). Learners going into the classroom may have different perceptions about teacher-assigned writing activities (Chen & Yu, 2019). Thus, learners’ perceptions about the activity are particularly important as they influence learners’ engagement with the activity, which ultimately influences learning outcomes (Storch & Wigglesworth, 2010). In the field of peer feedback in EFL and L2 academic writing, recent studies have found that students perceive peer feedback giving as helpful because it increases students’ academic writing skills and genre awareness (Yu, 2021), facilitates students’ writing development (Man et  al., 2018), and promotes transforming and constructing academic knowledge (Yang, 2016). Meanwhile, students have also reported confidence issues when giving feedback for academic writing due to low proficiency levels (Lee, 2017) or insufficient genre knowledge (Allen & Katayama, 2016), and expressed concerns over the effects their criticism would have on writers’ feelings (Yu, 2021).

Given that students’ perceptions about language learning can be changed or fostered in specific contexts (e.g., Aragao, 2011), prior research has explored students’ perceptions of giving academic writing feedback in various situations, such as face-to-face conferences (Allen & Katayama, 2016), anonymous emails (Zaccaron & Xhafaj, 2020), or technology-supported platforms (Chen, 2016; Yang, 2016). While these studies reveal why learners’ perceptions may impact engagement in feedback giving activities in enclosed contexts, how learners perceive academic peer feedback giving practice in community-based contexts has remained under-studied, let alone in online open community contexts. As elaborated above (see Figure 1), a student-centered online environment encouraging open communication, emotional expression and group cohesion enables the successful community-based feedback giving experience (Garrison, 2017). However, prior research about learner perceptions of giving academic writing feedback has been mostly conducted in relatively “closed” environments (e.g., Zaccaron & Xhafaj, 2020), where providers do not share interaction through communicating with each other or observing each other’s feedback.

Informed by the CoI model emphasizing open communication, emotional expression and group cohesion in student-centered environments, previous research has argued that feedback giving in an open environment (e.g., discussion forum as an open web-authoring platform) is more conducive to the development of cognitive knowledge (Ma et  al., 2017). In the EFL academic writing classroom, the open giving and sharing of peer feedback could play a vital role in building “a community of inquiry” (Hilliard & Stewart, 2019, p. 11) for academic knowledge co-construction. However, so far few studies have explored learners’ community-based peer feedback giving experience in academic writing through a computer-assisted system. For example, Yang (2016) examined graduates students’ perceptions towards their progress from peer feedback in an online academic summary writing task. Zou et  al. (2018) conducted a survey exploring reviewers’ attitudes and other underlying factors that influence students’ participation in online peer assessment. While these studies emphasized students’ perceptions towards academic writing knowledge transformation or participation through online peer feedback, the results were either primarily presented from the receivers’ perspective, or from the providers’ perspective focusing on benefits gained from reading peer’s writings (e.g., “I like to provide feedback to my peers because we can learn from each other. By giving feedback, I am able to view others’ academic summaries”). It remains unclear how learners perceive providing feedback in an open community and what they do in such activities–specifically, how students perceive observing peers’ feedback in an open environment in helping them give feedback on their own? According to the CoI model, the more open communication among providers as a parameter for social presence would lead to an enhanced cognitive presence. It is thus meaningful to explore learners’ perceptions of providing feedback in the more open communication contexts.

In terms of feedback focus, the results from previous studies are inconclusive concerning peer feedback providing practice in community-based academic writing, in which learners may provide form-based (e.g., Zhang et  al., 2018) or meaning-based (e.g., Ma, 2020) feedback. In recent studies, rather than emphasizing form and meaning, genre-based feedback, which provides genre-related knowledge and identifies problems within a specific genre of academic writing (Hyland, 2003), has been considered an effective way to raise students’ awareness of the purpose and contexts of their academic writings (e.g., Yu, 2021). Thus, it is valuable to investigate what students focus on when giving feedback in open rather than enclosed contexts. In the light of the CoI model, this study seeks to explore EFL learners’ perceptions and practice in providing feedback in online community-based academic writing contexts. Two central questions guide the present inquiry:

RQ1: What do EFL learners focus on when giving feedback in open communities? RQ2: How do they perceive the influence of observing peers’ feedback on their own feedback-giving practice?

# 3.  Methods

# 3.1.  Context and participants

Our inquiry was part of a larger research study about EFL learners’ feedback literacy development in online community-based contexts at a research university in northern China. The study was conducted based on a one-semester long academic writing course to prepare third-year English majors for thesis writing. In this course, teaching presence, cognitive presence, and social presence were orchestrated to foster a community of inquiry among Chinese EFL learners of academic writing. Participants were 31 students from two English academic writing classes $\scriptstyle ( n _ { 1 } = 1 4$ for Class 1; $n _ { 2 } = 1 7$ for Class 2) aged between 20 and 22. All the students were native Chinese speakers with 9–15 years of formal English education, with intermediate to advanced English writing proficiency based on their scores on Test for English Majors-Band 4 (on which an intermediate grade corresponds to Band 6 on IELTS). While students shared fairly homogeneous English proficiency, we still expected considerable individual differences in terms of computer assisted language learning experiences and beliefs regarding community peer feedback practice. The second author taught both classes. The course contents included three modules, namely, literature reviews in applied linguistics, critical discourse analyses, and close analyses of literary texts. For each module, the researcher-instructor combined a variety of instructional methods, such as literature reading, analysis of exemplars, and self, peer, and instructor feedback in face-to-face and computer-mediated communication contexts. As manifested in the course materials and grading rubrics, emphases were laid on the genre-related and content-related aspects of academic writing (see “Grading Rubrics” in Appendix I). In operationalizing our community-based approach, we adopted many-toone provision (following Berggren, 2015) and open sharing of feedback (following Cho & Schunn, 2007; Ma, 2020). By inviting students to give feedback to one exemplar and openly sharing their feedback, we aimed to not only expose students to the writing sample and enable them to compare the sample with their own writing in progress, but also to multiple exemplars of their peers’ feedback, thereby enabling them to compare peers’ feedback practices with their own (Nicol & McCallum, 2021). Specifically, the students were required to provide using real names detailed feedback on an 800-word-long section of an anonymous literature review, which the instructor had randomly extracted from the students’ assignments that were considered average. Care was taken that no students were aware that the writing under review was completed by their classmate. The length of the section under review (800 words) was considered appropriate based on the students’ limited proficiency in academic writing and the course time and resources available. The students were encouraged to offer their detailed responses to the literature review section and provide suggestions. This asynchronous feedback giving assignment was completed through an “e-learning forum” on the university portal, on which students can check posts or written texts, interact (i.e., like or dislike), comment and track peer feedback (see Figure 2).

It should be noted that this study operationalized the online peer feedback as single-blind for the receiver (the identity of the receiver was hidden), whereas all the feedback providers posted feedback in real name. This choice was for three reasons: 1) it is critical to build an open, trusting environment that encourages genuine negotiation and collaboration for creating a community of inquiry (Hilliard & Stewart, 2019); 2) it is likely that feedback providers assess their peers more reliably when they give comments in real name (Li et  al., 2016); 3) the anonymity of the receiver may reduce the face threat of the feedback comments and enable providers to give critical comments that are conducive to improving text quality (Cho & Cho, 2010).

Based on biographical surveys, while all participants were very familiar with and had regularly done peer feedback practice in pairs or in groups in the academic writing class, none of them had experience with community-based peer feedback practice. Although they were familiar with the other facilities of the forum, they had never used the discussion board functionality of the forum before. The second author who held a PhD degree in English Linguistics and had 11 years of teaching experiences with EFL students served as the instructor of this course. Such a role not only helped the authors access research participants, but also facilitated the process of data collection and analysis. Prior to data collection, research ethics approval was obtained from the university where the study was conducted, and the 31 participants were introduced to the aim and procedure of the research and signed consent forms. The data were labeled with students’ pseudonyms for analysis, and the master list of real names and pseudonyms (S1-S31) were kept by the first author until the course grades were posted by the second author (the instructor) at the end of the semester.

# 3.2.  Data collection and analysis

The data collection lasted 7 weeks in the Spring semester of 2021 and the data sources included biographical surveys, semi-structured interviews, follow-up WeChat interviews, and online community-based feedback entries from the 31 participating students. Table 1 provides an overview of the research procedures and data collection instruments. At Stage 1 (week 1), the instructor gave a pre-task training including the online community-based feedback task description with annotated examples (Appendix II) and the technical training about the feedback tool “e-learning forum” (e.g., creating accounts, sharing files, using various functions) (see Figure 2). Students were encouraged to give sentence-to-sentence feedback comments to the writing sample either in English or in Chinese, in order to facilitate their localized comments to specific problems (Patchan et  al., 2016) and engagement in open communication despite their limited English proficiency (Yu & Lee,

2016). All the students were then asked to complete a pre-task survey about their biographies and English learning experiences.

The actual feedback giving task began in Stage 2. In weeks 2-3, students posted the required peer feedback within one week. This task was due at the end of the week 3. At Stage 3, Author 1 divided the 31 participants into 7 groups and conducted a stimulated recall and an in-depth group interview with each group, following the practice of previous learner perception studies (e.g., Mulder et  al., 2013). During the interview, students were first given a copy of all feedback comments from 31 students and were given 10 minutes to recall about the community-based feedback giving activity they had experienced and the feedback comments they had documented. Then, they were invited to explain why they provided feedback as they did, what they focused on, and what they did to peers’ feedback before, during and after composing their own feedback comments (see interview questions in Appendix III). The interviews were conducted in Mandarin Chinese and were audio-recorded. In Stage 4, the researchers identified some points of interest in the interview transcripts of 5 of the students, and conducted follow-up WeChat interviews in Mandarin Chinese with each of them for further clarifications and elaborations.

The semi-structured interviews, WeChat interviews, and feedback comments in Chinese were translated and transcribed verbatim by the researchers. They were then sent to the participants through emails for accuracy checking. All the transcripts were analyzed according to the analytical scheme for qualitative data (Miles et  al., 2014). The two researchers constantly read and analyzed the data both deductively and inductively, and the process of analysis was interactive and recursive. The researchers carefully reviewed and coded the data to identify the themes. Through a recursive process of open coding, we allowed themes to emerge from the data and codes to categorize the emerging themes. We then compared and reduced the themes into major categories. More specifically, to answer RQ1, we compared the data from the in-depth interviews and the online feedback comments to speculate about the students’ feedback focuses. The two researchers first collaboratively revisited the interview data and compared “on what they said they focused” to “on what they actually focused” in the feedback comments and divided all the feedback comments line by line into feedback points (similar to Hyland, 2003, pp. 220–221; i.e., each point deals with one error area, see examples in Table 2). Then, the researchers identified the codes of each feedback point for feedback focus and created coding guidelines with a master list of emerging feedback focuses. After that, the researchers independently identified whether or not each student addressed the feedback focuses based on the master list.

To answer RQ2, the interview data and the online feedback comments, triangulated with the follow-up WeChat interviews, were primarily analyzed to examine students’ perceptions of peers’ feedback in online community-based feedback giving. The researchers read the data iteratively to identify various codes related to participants’ perceptions of giving peer feedback in online community-based contexts in general, with special attention to how, in the students’ perceptions, observing peers’ feedback affected their own feedback giving practice. Sample initial codes included: Impede independent thinking, deeper cognitive processing, reflection of own writing practice, opportunity for social interaction as a way of consolidating instruction, looking for better feedback practice, etc. Then the researchers compared, cross checked, sorted and categorized the codes from open coding. Informed by the CoI model, we grouped the themes yielding from the open coding into overarching categories which represented important intersections of the teaching presence, cognitive presence, and social presence. For example, “promoting social interactions in knowledge co-construction” was identified by combining the themes of “open communication of ideas” and “seeking group alignment.” For the rigor of the data analysis, the two researchers independently coded the data and resolved disagreements through discussion. They both held a doctorate degree in Applied Linguistics and more than 10 years of research experiences. Cohen’s Kappa for the initial coding was 0.95, indicating high inter-rater reliability. Disagreements were resolved through discussions.

# 4.  Findings

Based on the data analysis described above, the learner feedback focuses and learner perceptions are presented in this part.

# 4.1.  Focuses of learner feedback

The peer feedback analysis yielded 887 feedback points, including positive feedback and criticism. Table 2 displays a classification of the peer feedback focuses in the online community-based feedback practice. It should be noted that we calculated the percentage of students rather than feedback points addressing each problem type (also see Gao et  al., 2019), in order to prevent bias created by the overrepresentation of a particular problem type by any single student.1 It is shown that students paid greater attention to the genre-related (coherence, function) and content-related (e.g., content, organization) over form-related aspects of the sample (e.g., lexical choice, grammatical error), which was in keeping with the course objectives as manifested in the course syllabus, instructional materials, and grading rubrics that were provided at the onset of and through the semester. In the stimulated recalls, students also frequently mentioned that they referred to the grading rubrics (see Appendix I) and instructional contents when considering which aspects of the sample to comment on. The close alignment between the learners’ feedback focus and the instructional contents exemplified the interaction between the teaching presence and the cognitive presence according to the CoI framework.

# 4.2.  Perceptions of feedback giving in online community-based contexts

This section reports on five themes related to the participants’ perceptions of the community-based online feedback giving practice. Importantly, these five themes each highlights the affordances of this form of activity emergent from an intersection among the teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence. The most representative quotations were selected to illustrate each of the themes.

# Probing for affective appropriateness in single-blind review

A shaping factor in the students’ perceptions of community-based feedback giving is the perceived asymmetric anonymity between the providers and the receiver(s). It means the receiver or receivers are anonymous to the providers but the providers are mutually acknowledgeable. In general, most students (30/31) replied favorably to the form of asymmetric anonymity.

On the concerns about the receiver’s emotional responses, on the one hand, students expressed that the anonymity of the writing sample pushed them to be more objective and professional, because “the writing sample was randomly selected’ (S28, interview) and ‘there is no need to worry about hurting the writer’s feelings since the writing sample is anonymous” (S28, interview). On the other hand, the participants were also concerned that the single blind review prevented them from possible dialogue with the anonymous writer, thus impeding deeper cognitive processing of the work. S26 explained,

If I knew who wrote this paper, it would be easier for me to put myself in her/ his shoes. If I knew this was written by one of my classmates, I would understand her or his writing better, because I would be familiar with the way she or he thinks. (S26, interview)

More importantly, students praised the open sharing of information between the providers as opposed to the anonymity between the receiver(s) and the providers. The key assistance that the students perceived from this open environment was in seeking community consensus on affective appropriateness when giving feedback. For example, several participants explained that they adopted a more direct approach as they noticed other providers were very critical, so they felt it appropriate to bluntly point out the mistakes (e.g., S5, S23, interviews). Figure 3 below gives an example of how S5 bluntly provided feedback:

[Translation] What indeed does ‘it’ refer to? Do you mean frequency or the lexical LREs? It looks like you mean frequency. Revise it.

Some students similarly sought for the community consensus on affective appropriateness, but approached feedback differently. As S6 remarked, ‘I felt all the students were too critical. I felt it was not appropriate. I felt sorry for the receiver’ (Interview). She ended up choosing to keep a balance between critical judgment and politeness (Feedback entry).

# Finding one’s own voice

Most students (22/31) perceived giving feedback in online community-based contexts affected the ways they sought for their own voices as feedback givers, which can be explained in two ways: how it facilitated the students’ exploration for their own voices and how it impeded their independent thinking in expressing their own voices.

On the positive side, the students looked for specific ways to articulate ideas through observing peers’ feedback. When students encountered such situations as having ‘no clue about which problem to comment on’ (S11, interview) and being ‘stuck with how to express the idea’ (S29, interview), they reviewed the comments for inspirations. Second, some of the students tended to assert their ideas within the community after comparing with peers’ comments or making their own judgments after observing diverse opinions. The following data displayed how S15 sought the community consensus and adjusted her ideas through comparing with peers:

Originally, I thought my feedback was ok. After I read how others commented on this sentence, I thought I did not express clearly how I wanted the receiver to revise. So I adjusted my comments by adding some explanations. (S15, interview)

As we can see, S15 found his voice after comparing her own practice with his peers’. Different from S15, the example below displays how S26 asserted her own position after observing peers’ diverse opinions:

I was not sure my whether or not my judgment was right. I was worried about giving wrong comments. So I read through the posts to find out how others’ commented on this point. I saw others had completely different views. So I thought this must be a tricky question. Then I felt confident to express my own opinion. (S26, interview)

Not only did the online community-based context assist the students in finding their own voices, but it also gave rise to concerns that it might impede their independent thinking when making their own voices. Comments such as ‘it might interfere with my independent thinking’ (S3) and ‘I tended to train myself to think independently’ (S4) were repeatedly expressed in the interviews, evidencing that many students consciously avoided relying on others or being led by others when striving to find their own voices.

# Seeking better practice

The data analysis also indicated that students perceived community-based contexts as opportunities for seeking better feedback giving practice. Specifically, students reported that they looked for better formats and structures before commenting. For example, S31 explained,

I didn’t know what the best format was in giving feedback. I started by listing all the issues I needed to address in my comments. Then I found it was not clear which comment refers to which sentence. But later I was surprised by what one of my classmates did. She started with the specificities, but finished the feedback with some overall comments. It was a perfect practice. (S31, follow-up WeChat interview)

Apparently S31 adopted this strategy in her feedback practice, and Figure 4 gives an example how S31 ended her feedback summarizing the main issues the writer had in her literature review:

[Translation] Summary: 1. No definition is provided of the key concepts (e.g., group size, LRE) throughout the paper. 2. There is no claim or a clear explanation of the writer’s stance. 3. The author simply listed many studies and their findings without organizing them into a specific order or explicitly explaining why these studies were cited. 4. The language is not accurate and concise enough.

Students also referred to each other’s feedback for more perspectives. S26, for example, explained that she expanded the scope of her feedback by learning from her peers’ practice:

As a writer I pay a lot of attention to coherence and lexical choice, and my feedback initially focused on these two dimensions exclusively. When I read my classmates’ feedback, I found they also attended to citational practices and explanations of key concepts. I thought: “That’s nice. I didn’t think about that.” So I added these to my feedback too. (S26, interview)

# Promoting social interaction in knowledge co-construction

The fourth theme is about the enhanced social interaction that the community-based online peer feedback brought to the students in their knowledge co-construction. Most students (20/31) ascribed the comparative effectiveness of the community feedback giving practice over traditional peer feedback to the open communication of ideas among the providers. S3 stated,

We get more perspectives from the community…because we discuss the problems and share all the thoughts in this community. (S3, interview)

Another student, S5, also highlighted an advantage of community-based feedback in social effect, namely, she considered open community feedback as a way to socially and emotionally connect with the classmates and seek for group alignment. She said,

Unlike high school, we have very limited time to talk to each other in college. It is easy for us to get lost for many homework assignments, because we do not get to communicate often. I like online community feedback because I get to see how others think about and do the homework. Then I am confident about what to do. (S5, interview)

S5’s confidence in the feedback giving assignment was boosted by her sense of staying within the group, which was enabled through open access to others’ feedback.

# Self-reflection and transfer

The last theme regarding students’ perceptions is that the online community feedback encouraged the students’ deeper cognitive processing of the genre knowledge taught in the class, the work under review, and their own writing practice, which motivated them to revise their own work. First, most students (24/31) appreciated the facilitative role of open, community-based feedback giving in consolidating their genre knowledge which had been taught to them in the previous semester. For example, see S15’s following feedback:

[Translation] I am positive that this literature review on group size and LRE did not follow the CARS model. At least, you did not follow the sequential order from Move 1 [i.e., establishing the research territory] to Move 2 [i.e., establishing a niche].

The facilitative role of the community-based feedback giving exercise in knowledge consolidation is also reflected in S18’s interview:

I see looking at others’ comments as an extra opportunity to review what the teacher taught in class. I thought I understood everything we discussed in class. But when it comes to giving comments, I got stuck with what to say. They I looked at what others said. It was like: A-ha yes. He is right. (S18, interview)

Second, many students (16/31) emphasized that they ‘reflected over similar mistakes’ in their own writings (S13, interview) and suspected their peers ‘would point out the same mistakes’ (S13, interview) if their drafts aJ#, jfT\*, j# groupsize LRE X4TJ J CARS model,>##F move1 move2 #FL

Figure 5. E xcerpt of S15’s feedback.

were to be commented on openly. For example, after constantly observing several comments about creating a research space (see Figure 5), S25 said,

When the teacher taught the CARS model, I didn’t understand it thoroughly. But when I did the assignment, I found it harder than I thought. I realized I needed to go back and check if I followed the model to create a research space. (S25, interview)

Apart from deeper processing of genre knowledge, the students also mentioned observing peers’ feedback motivated them to explore the cited literature more deeply. S13 remarked,

When I saw a lot of requests for clarification or comments about the purposes of the cited studies, I went back to these studies and read them again, because I chose a similar topic and I cited these studies as well. (S13, interview)

This quote indicated that repeatedly seeing the similar comments reinforced and confirmed students’ concerns, which motivated them to deeply analyze the literature and reflect on their own work.

# 5.  Discussion and conclusion

Based on the revised Community of Inquiry (CoI) model as our analytical framework, this study set out to investigate learners’ feedback practice and their perceptions of providing peer feedback in the online community-based academic writing contexts. The data from the 31 Chinese undergraduates revealed that although students provided feedback with different focuses, most of them (30 out of 31) valued online community peer feedback over traditional peer feedback. Students appreciated this form of feedback for seeking affective appropriateness (e.g., S5, S23), maximizing social interaction (e.g., S3, S5), seeking better practice (e.g., S26, S31), finding the reviewers’ own voices (e.g., S15, S26) through different stages of reflective knowledge building processes (e.g., S26), and transferring to subsequent revisions (e.g., S25). Some students (e.g., S3, S4) also expressed concerns as observing peers’ feedback in an open environment may impede independent thinking in expressing their own voices. What CoI contributed to this study was that it allowed us to understand how providing online peer feedback can function as a community-building intervention through positive interactions between teaching presence, social presence and cognitive presence, which in turn could pave the way for effective learning of EFL academic writing. These findings can not only contribute to the literature of peer feedback by demonstrating a model for explaining learners’ perceptions of the interrelationship between cognitive and socio-cultural perspectives of learning (e.g., the relation between multiple rounds of reflections and open communities of inquiry), but also advance peer feedback research on the provider end by revealing evidence that observing peers’ feedback may enhance the learners’ own feedback giving practice in online community-based contexts.

In line with previous research on feedback focusing on L2 and EFL academic writing (e.g., Ma, 2020; Neumann & McDonough, 2014), this study found students tended to focus on content/meaning rather than form issues in providing feedback. However, a somewhat surprising finding that extends previous inconclusive results concerning peer feedback focus (either form- or meaning- focused) (Ma, 2020; Zhang et  al., 2018) was that a large amount of feedback from genre-related perspectives (e.g., function, coherence, citation) was exhibited. This result could be explained by the interactions among social presence, teaching presence and cognitive presence. The teaching presence, manifested in the teacher-provided guidelines, annotation examples, and pre-task discussions, enabled students to build their meta-cognitive awareness of academic writing feedback literacy, and students practiced feedback giving through checking with peers and comparing with teacher-taught knowledge. Taking S5 for example, she started out not knowing what the feedback would look like until she noticed many feedback comments in the community were related to the CARS model that the instructor emphasized in class. This finding highlights that the teacher-led pre-task knowledge preparations and observations of others’ work led to the students’ deeper processing of the genre knowledge, which in turn supports ‘higher levels of learning through critical discourse and reflection’ (Garrison & Kanuka, 2004, p. 98).

Genre-based feedback helps students become aware of genre knowledge and identify problems within a specific genre of academic writing (Hyland, 2003), but providing genre feedback is a challenge due to students’ insufficient expertise and knowledge of academic writing (Yu, 2021). The current study suggests that the community-based feedback can improve students’ insufficient expertise and knowledge of academic writing through different stages of reflective knowledge building processes. For instance, S15 initially thought that his feedback-giving practice was “ok”, but at the post-feedback-giving stage he found his approach inadequate and made revisions after comparing with others’ comments. Such findings shed new light on the implementation of asynchronous online community feedback through enhanced social presence, namely, the open communication among multiple feedback givers.

While it remains to be further explored the relationships between feedback effectiveness and anonymity in feedback giving both on the receiver and provider ends, this study suggests that asymmetric anonymity (single-blind on the receiver end, i.e., the identity of the receiver is hidden while all learners post feedback in real name) could benefit L2 learning by setting up a climate for honest, constructive criticism. There is no denial that ideally open communication should take place not only among the feedback providers but also between the providers and the receivers; nevertheless, we argue that asymmetric anonymity could be an effective training strategy that prepares students for this ultimate goal. When providers know whose work they comment on, they are more likely to provide positive comments which may not reflect the quality of the writing (Ma, 2020) instead of providing critical comments which are conducive for improving the quality (Cho & Cho, 2010). Thus, this study contributed to existing literature by revealing anonymity on the receiver end promotes students to provide critical feedback as the design may both reduce the face threat to the receiver while preserve the open communication among the providers. In the case of S5, she perceived the community consensus on affective appropriateness when giving critical feedback, and aligned with her peers in the community by toning up her criticalness. Not like many of the previous studies with double-blind designs for online feedback practices (e.g., Gao et  al., 2019), this finding is particularly important because learners’ cognitive development critically hinges upon an open, trusting environment that encourages genuine negotiation and collaboration (Hilliard & Stewart, 2019).

The findings of this study also indicate that community-based peer feedback enhanced the student’s self-reflection over their own academic writings and therefore may transfer to subsequent revisions. On the one hand, although previous research in L2 academic writing has demonstrated online peer feedback facilitates knowledge transformation, the current study provided evidence for the first time that the improvement in feedback providing practice can motivate reviewers to revise their own work. As manifested by S13, she downloaded the relevant articles to which other peers referred when addressing the problems, and read them more carefully to modify her own draft. Our finding also extends previous studies (e.g., Berggren, 2015) that implementing peer feedback can result in an enhancement of the feedback givers’ ability to write and revise in subsequent writing, by discovering a new perspective of community inquiry in academic feedback literacy.

In this study, we have proposed a framework for analyzing a successful online community peer feedback learning experience. We hope that our framework has provided a useful lens through which to examine interactions between teaching presence, social presence and cognitive presence in community-based peer feedback and we encourage other researchers to adapt our framework or to devise alternative analytical frameworks to examine online community peer feedback that addresses a full range of tasks. In particular, by illustrating open communication for social presence, we referred to the observations of written discourse in the reflective knowledge building process. Further research may extend this research and explore community peer feedback with an openly shared online tool that allows other forms of oral or written peer interactions. Also, the rich forms of dialogic relations among the peers as revealed in the interviews may deepen our understanding of how learners integrate multiple peers’ comments in giving peer feedback themselves.

Our study has several limitations. First, the findings could have been strengthened by arranging multiple rounds of peer feedback giving practices with different receivers to observe the longitudinal effects; due to space limitations, we did not examine transfer to the students’ subsequent revision either. Despite these limitations, our findings have yielded several insights for classroom practice. First and foremost, in an age when education is greatly empowered by digital technologies, teachers and educators could create an online community of inquiry as a way to promote learners’ feedback giving practice through multiple rounds of reflective thinking. Second, this study indicates that asymmetric anonymity (single-blind for the receiver) could be implemented to create a community of inquiry in L2 writing class where knowledge is co-constructed and openly shared by all learners. Rules may be set up so that students take turns to be blinded receivers of peer feedback to ensure more students get to play both receiver and provider roles. Third, teachers should also prepare learners for online community-based feedback giving through meta-cognitive instructions, so that students can develop their knowledge about the academic genre through comparing teacher and peer affordances.

To conclude, our study has shown learners’ feedback practice and their perceptions of providing peer feedback through creating an online community-based inquiry. It is recommended that future research on this topic adopt a longitudinal approach to investigate the long-term change in learners’ practice and perceptions of online community feedback across multiple tasks. This would provide a more comprehensive picture of how teacher presence, cognitive presence and social presence interplay in realizing the potential benefits of community-based feedback. Because the theme of ‘transfer to subsequent writing’ was identified in this study, and the development in the learners’ capability of providing feedback does not necessarily guarantee their development in L2 writing (Wu, 2019), it is also recommended that future studies look at the effects of community-based feedback practice on learners’ subsequent revisions and the quality of their future writings.

# Task Description with Examples of Comments on Student Writing

Read the following excerpt from a student’s literature review closely. You are required to post your responses, questions, and suggestions for improvement in a sentence-by-sentence way as follow-ups to my discussion thread at the learning portal X. You may use either Chinese or English in the comments. The assignment is due in one week.

For illustration, see the following examples:

Group Size and LRE

The study of LREs has found that learners working collaboratively discuss mechanical, grammatical and vocabulary problems (e.g., Storch, 2007, 2008; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2007, 2010; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009).

[The first statement addresses $" L R E "$ without addressing "group size."]

The study (Garaía Mayo & Zeitler, 2016) investigates whether learner set up in interaction, namely in pairs or small groups, influences the frequency and outcome of lexical language-relted episodes (LREs) and L2 vocabulary learning.

[Why is this study introduced? What is the claim it supports? Why should we learn about the details of this study? Is it the only study that addressed the relation between group size and LRE?]

# Sample interview questions

1. Can you give an overall evaluation of the feedback giving practice?   
2. In what ways do you like or dislike this practice? Can you give some examples?   
3. When giving feedback, which areas did you focus on? Why?   
4. What kind of feedback did you most frequently give? Why?   
5. Did you look at peers’ feedback before you started writing your own feedback? Can you give some examples?   
6. Did you refer to peers’ feedback while you gave your own feedback? Can you give examples?   
7. Did you check back on peers’ feedback after you posted your own feedback? Did you edit your feedback afterwards? Can you give some examples?   
8. How helpful do you think observing peers’ feedback was in helping with your own feedback giving? Can you give some examples?

What challenges did you have in this feedback giving practice? Can you give some examples?In what ways do you think this practice is different from the peer feedback practices you had in the past semesters? Can you give some examples?
