$1 0 \%$ The popularity of the remaining four questions ranged between 4%-8% of the candidature.

The following is a summary of candidates' general performance in each question.

Question 2: Learning English through Popular Culture

This question required candidates to write an essy disussng rasons for the popularity among Instagrammers of taking photos of Hong Kong's housing estates, and residents' opinions on this phenomenon.

The majority of candidates showed that they understood the demands of the question and were able to describe and give a range of relevant and appropriate explanations, in addition to showing an understanding of the residents viewpoints. Candidates generally addressed both parts of the question though some neglected to comment on the residents perspectives or focused too much on the popularity of Instagram.Stronger essays included varied and creative ideas with greater elaboration.Most candidates showed an awareness of the teacher as audience and appropriately wrote in a formal to semiformal tone.

Candidates showed an ability to use a range of linguistic forms to discuss the issue, including different tenses and aspects passive and active forms, and direct and indirect speech to report interviewees

It was important to write about dragon boat racing and to engage with the criteria given. Some candidates misunderstood the question and proposed other sports to be included in the Olympics, such as e-sports. Others discussed alternative criteria which could be considered, but these ideas tended to be less persuasive as they did not address the standards set by the IOC. Weaker performances also tended to use linking sufficiently to the pros. t while alcn he n      e so.

Question 8: Learning English through Short Stories

Candidates were required to write the opening chapter of a story as part of their entry to a story competition in a sci-fi magazine. The main character (journalist), setting (research station in the Arctic) and problem (people in the station mysteriously disappearing) were provided in the question.

It was important not to write a complete narrative. Stronger candidates had very creative ideas and demonstrated an ability to engage the reader and capture their interest so that they would want to continue to the next chapter.Weaker candidates struggled with understanding aspects of the context provided in the question and this impacted on the relevance of the content.

Recommendations

Language

Candidates need to balance demonstrating what they know with making their writing appropriate to the particular text type they are asked to write.Writing simple sentences accurately might be enough in some tasks but might be too limited for others requiring more linguistic flexibility. It is a good idea for candidates to read different text types and to become familiar with what is appropriate for particular purposes and audiences.

As with language choice, coherence can be achieved in different ways depending on the text type. Candidates are usually quite good at connecting ideas explicity in persuasive or argumentative essays. In some text types (e.g. blog, letter) too much logical development might actually detract from effective organisation, however. Again, familiarity with different text types is key to raising awareness of how these texts are organised effectively.

Part B tasks can be completed in around 400 words. Longer responses will not necessarily gain higher marks simply by virtue of length. If writing beyond the word guide, the length should not impede the communicative effectiveness.
