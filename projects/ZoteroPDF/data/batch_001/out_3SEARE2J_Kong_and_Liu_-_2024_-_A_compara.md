There has been growing interest in the performance and efficiency of ChatGPT in generating academic texts. However, little empirical research has been conducted on its performance in producing review article abstracts. This study adopts the genre analysis approach to investigate the rhetorical moves of review article abstracts in hard and soft science disciplines based on two self-compiled corpora, respectively including 160 scholar-written abstracts from four high-impact international journals, and 160 abstracts generated by ChatGPT, with an aim to reveal the similarities and differences between human-written and AI-generated English review article abstracts. The results show significant differences between human-written and ChatGPT-generated abstracts, first in the frequency of three out of the five moves, and then in the sequential order of moves, with each type of abstracts demonstrating a preference for move sequence patterns as well as obligatory and optional elements. The two types of abstracts differ significantly in the frequency of move embedding, but share the same embedding combination patterns. These findings may deepen our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities and limitations in generating academic texts across different disciplines, help improve the generative AI system, then highlight the complex relationship among the structure of academic abstracts, discipline cultures and genre knowledge.

# 1. Introduction

Since OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in November 2023, an increasing amount of literature has been produced to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in scientific writing (e.g. Benichou, 2023; Dergaa et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Huang & Tan, 2023; Salvagno et al., 2023). The evaluation is crucial as it might allow researchers to determine the effectiveness of the large language model in specific research practices (van Dis et al., 2023). Extant studies have indicated that ChatGPT might offer benefits for academic article writing (e.g. Benichou, 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Macdonald et al., 2023; Majovský ´ et al., 2023).

However, the performance of ChatGPT in generating review article abstracts remains unclear. Review article abstracts may be an essential subtype of academic genre (Hyland, 2000; Hyland & Diani, 2009). Some have argued that abstract writing could be complicated for human writers due to potential time constraints (El-Kassas, Salama, Rafea, & Mohamed, 2021) and difficulties faced by language learners (Al Fadda, 2012). Similarly, generating review article abstracts could pose a significant challenge for ChatGPT since the composition might be influenced by factors such as knowledge of abstract move structure and disciplinary cultures.

This study seeks to assess ChatGPT’s efficacy in composing abstracts for review articles by comparing the rhetorical moves of review article abstracts generated by ChatGPT and composed by human writers across four social and natural science disciplines, aiming to deepen our understanding of ChatGPT’s performance in academic writing and provide valuable insights for refining and optimizing the generative AI technology by illuminating the intricate associations between rhetorical moves and disciplinary cultures in academic text generation.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Review article abstract writing

An abstract is “a brief, comprehensive summary of the contents of the paper” (American Psychological Association, 2020, p. 38). Review article abstracts are an important part of review articles, which have the explicit purpose of evaluating the research and benefiting the construction of knowledge of various disciplines as well as facilitating the social cohesiveness of scholarly communities (Hyland, 2000; Hyland & Diani, 2009). High-quality abstracts should be concise, self-sufficient, unbiased, and provide complete and accurate information (Bavdekar & Gogtay, 2015).

Abstract writing is highly important, for well-written abstracts could help researchers to appeal to readers and promote their studies. Abstracts could shape readers’ decisions on whether the accompanying article merits further reading (Hyland, 2000). Abstract writing may also be challenging and time-consuming, as academic writing is a sophisticated and effortful skill, especially for language learners (Al Fadda, 2012; Al-Mukdad, 2019; Biber & Gray, 2010; Evans & Green, 2007). Abstract writing is influenced by disciplinary cultures, as Hyland (2000) argued that academic writing, the formation of knowledge, the cultures of various disciplines and social interactions are all closely interlinked.

# 2.2. Genre and move analysis

Genre is generally accepted as a rhetorical, socially contextual category of discourse in the field of discourse analysis (Bhatia, 1993; Hyland, 2015; Martin, 2009; Swales, 1990, 2004). The defining characteristic of a genre is its communicative purpose (Swales, 1990). Genres process recurrent configurations of cultural meanings with social purposes that are achieved progressively (Martin, 2009). Moreover, genres, as community-based actions, shape persuasive arguments and reinforce group identity and disciplinary practices (Hyland, 2015).

Genre analysis is generally recognized as a widely used method for examining the structure and purpose of non-literary genres. It has a set of analytic methods used for examining various genres within situated contexts (Tardy, 2011), and serves as a tool for improving educational methodologies in areas like rhetoric, composition studies, professional writing, English for specific purposes (ESP), etc. (Hyon, 1996).

John Swales has substantially contributed to genre analysis of academic discourses. In his landmark work Genre Analysis, Swales (1990) introduced the CARS (Create a Research Space) model for investigating the move structure of article introductions, and the IMRD (i.e. Introduction–Method–Results–Discussion) model for scrutinizing the move structure of full-length empirical research articles (RA). He advocated for a genre-based approach to English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and showed how research and pedagogical application can be intertwined (Aull & Swales, 2015).

Move analysis is a widely used genre analysis approach, which primarily focuses on the rhetorical moves of a genre. A move usually denotes a coherent unit of speech or writing that serves a specific communicative purpose in a conversation or discourse (Swales, 2004). Tardy and Swales (2014) pointed out that when conducting move analysis, researchers first identify general structure patterns and initial move categories from a representative corpus of texts, then determine individual rhetorical moves, distinguishing between obligatory and optional moves, and the possibilities for the sequence of moves. This analysis, either qualitative or quantitative, may extend to the analysis of the “steps” or sub-moves of each move. Also, notably, moves are basically considered rhetorical categories, not grammatical ones, and a move may vary in size and be potentially realized non-verbally.

# 2.3. Move structure of academic paper abstracts

Different move structures of academic paper abstracts have been found, such as 4-move pattern (i.e. [Introducing purpose], [Describing methodology], [Summarizing results], [Presenting conclusions]) (Bhatia, 1993), 5-move pattern (i.e. [Situating the research], [Presenting the research], [Describing the methodology], [Summarizing the results], [Discussing the research] (Santos, 1996), and 6-move pattern (i.e. [Setting the background for the study and its importance], [Mentioning gaps addressed by the study], [Stating the purpose, question, hypothesis of study], [Identifying the methodology], [Stating the findings or argument], [Offering concluding remarks]) (Tessuto, 2015). Previous studies have shown that the moves in academic article abstracts can be classified as conventional or optional (Tanko, ´ 2017), and move embedding and the reversal of the sequential order of moves are two typical characteristics of academic paper abstracts (Santos, 1996; Bhatia, 1993).

# 2.4. The application of ChatGPT in academic writing

ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is a large language model (LLM) that allows users to interact with it using prompts and is capable of generating high-quality texts. ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5, one of the most extensive large language models to date, with over 175 billion parameters (Shen et al., 2023). Its training data consist of a wide variety of internet texts, such as books, articles, websites, etc., and it utilizes reinforcement learning from human feedback for training. This method helps ChatGPT to fine-tune its responses based on human evaluators’ inputs. Consequently, ChatGPT would have the capacity to understand users’ prompts and generate human-like texts.

Previous studies have shown that ChatGPT can be used in various academic writing tasks, such as drafting research articles (e.g. Benichou, 2023; Macdonald et al., 2023; Majovský ´ et al., 2023), generating academic article and conference abstracts (e.g. Babl & Babl, 2023; Gao et al., 2023), writing peer review reports (Hosseini & Horbach, 2023), and producing scientific case reports (Buholayka et al., 2023). For instance, evaluations of article abstracts generated by ChatGPT for 50 scientific medical papers suggest that the lexicogrammatical expressions are more formulaic vis-a-vis \` those written by humans (Gao et al., 2023), and the text is more generic and less tailored to a specific context. The output from ChatGPT may not fully emulate human-like text, occasionally displaying repetitive phrases or words, along with unusual or inconsistent language usage (Cotton et al., 2023). Although ChatGPT can be used to help editors with repetitive and tedious tasks, promote the spread of new research ideas, and save time and resources by drafting findings and formatting papers according to journal standards, the ethical issues with ChatGPT cannot be ignored, including authorship ambiguity, plagiarism, and missing references in its outputs (Lund et al., 2023).

# 2.5. Existing gaps and the present study

The literature has recognized that the review article is a key genre in academic fields (Hyland, 2000; Hyland & Diani, 2009) and abstract writing is considered important (Hyland, 2000) and challenging for most writers, particularly for L2 and EFL learners (Al Fadda, 2012; Al-Mukdad, 2019; Biber & Gray, 2010; Evans & Green, 2007). Previous studies have shown that ChatGPT can be used in many academic writing tasks (e.g. Benichou, 2023; Macdonald et al., 2023; Majovský ´ et al., 2023) and be conducive to the abstract writing of research papers (Gao et al., 2023). However, what is not yet clearly understood is the actual performance of ChatGPT in generating review article abstracts.

In order to address this research gap, we conducted a comparative genre analysis using two self-compiled corpora—the Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts and the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts. The following four questions were attempted to be answered.

1) What is the overall distribution of moves across the two corpora?   
2) What is the distribution of moves across the four disciplines across the two corpora?   
3) What is the sequential order of the moves across the two corpora?   
4) What is the move embedding across the two corpora?

# 3. Theoretical framework and research methodology

# 3.1. Theoretical framework

The initial step in our research was to establish a comprehensive analytical framework, and then to use the framework to conduct reliable annotation of moves within our corpora. Since the identification of moves is one of the crucial annotation processes, it is pivotal to define the fundamental term “move”. We adhered to Swales’ (2004) definition of moves as “discoursal or rhetorical units performing coherent communicative functions in texts” (pp. 228–229), referring to moves as functional rather than formal units in our study.

To avoid the reliability and validity issues associated with the form-oriented methodology (Lu, Yoon, & Kisselev, 2021), a function-oriented approach was implemented, and the annotation was based solely on the function or content of the abstracts in this study. Santos’ (1996) five-move structure model was adopted as the base framework (as shown in Table 1).

The model has been widely acknowledged within the EAP community (Biber & Conrad, 2019; Jiang & Hyland, 2017; Omidian et al., 2018; Pho, 2008) as being adept at covering the move structure of both structured and unstructured abstracts (Hartley et al., 1996). However, we anticipated that some adjustments to this model would be necessary because of the interdisciplinary variations present in the review article abstract writing practices found in our data. The final analytical framework is provided in Table 2.

Table 1 Santos’ (1996) five-move structure model.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Move</td><td>Move structure</td></tr><tr><td>Move 1</td><td>Situating the research</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sub-move 1A: Stating current knowledge Sub-move 1B: Citing previous research</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sub-move 1C: Extended previous research</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Move 2</td><td>Sub-move 2: Stating a problem</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Presenting the research</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sub-move 1A: Indicating main features</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sub-move 1B: Indicating main purpose</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sub-move 2: Hypothesis raising</td></tr><tr><td>Move 3</td><td>Describing the methodology</td></tr><tr><td>Move 4</td><td>Summarizing the results</td></tr><tr><td> Move 5</td><td>Discussing the research</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sub-move 1: Drawing conclusions Sub-move 2: Giving recommendations</td></tr></table></body></html>

Move structure analysis is utilized to examine the significance of specific moves (whether they were obligatory or optional), the sequential positioning of these moves, and their embedding (Samraj, 2014). Tanko´ (2017) argued that the boundary between obligatory and optional moves is debatable since move stability criteria may be influenced by the characteristics of the discourse community or disciplinary conventions. The threshold between obligatory and optional moves stands at $5 0 \%$ in our study, following the approach adopted by Nwogu (1997) and Swales (1990). Specifically, a move appearing in over $5 0 \%$ of the 160 abstracts in the corpus was categorized as obligatory, while one occurring below $5 0 \%$ was considered optional. These three characteristics of moves have been integrated into our adapted framework (see Fig. 1). The entire corpus was annotated for moves and sub-moves, and then the frequency and sequential pattern of moves and move embedding were examined.

# 3.2. Data collection and corpus compilation

The data used in the current study comes from two self-complied corpora: the Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts (henceforth H) and the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts (henceforth GPT). H consists of the abstracts of 160 review articles published in major journals in the following four social and natural science disciplines: Anthropology, Education, Engineering, and Physics. These disciplines were chosen based on Becher’s (1994) argument that academic disciplines can be grouped into four categories: humanities and pure social sciences, applied social sciences, technologies and pure sciences. One journal was selected in each discipline based on the Scimago Journal Rank (SJR) indicator in 2022. Forty review articles were selected in each journal in the period of 2018–2022. GPT includes 160 review article abstracts, which were generated by ChatGPT merely based on the content (without pictures, tables and figures)1 of the 160 human-written review articles. The corpus information is provided in Table 3, which shows that the number of tokens in each discipline is largely comparable.

In the generation process, the review article was divided into several sections mainly due to the character input limit for each interaction with the ChatGPT 3.5 version. As for the abstract generation, the following prompts were fed to the 3.5 model.

(1) 我接下来要在多个对话中, 提供给你用 $^ \Gamma ( \ @ ) \lrcorner$ 编号的文章内容, 格式为 $@ \mathbf { i } = <$ <内容 $>$ , 请先记住它们, 不要提供各自的摘要, 可以 吗? (English translation: I will provide article content marked with ${ \Gamma } _ { ( \overline { { \alpha } } ) }$ numbers in the format of $@ \mathrm { i } = <$ the content> in the following conversations. Please remember them first without providing summaries for each, okay?)   
(2) 请记住@i, 不要提供摘要: (English translation: Please remember $@ \mathbf { i }$ and do not provide a summary) $( \mathbf { i } = 1$ , 2, 3, …n-1)   
(3) 请为@n到 $@ { \mathfrak { m } }$ 的内容生成一份符合期刊综述论文格式的英文摘要, 字数不要超过 … …个单词。(English translation: Please generate an English abstract for the content from $@ \mathbf { n }$ to $@ { \mathfrak { m } }$ in the format of a journal review paper, and the word count should not exceed … words.2 )

During the annotation phase, three annotators3 independently analyzed a random selection of 32 abstracts, which represented $1 0 \%$ of the total 320 abstracts collected. Inter-rater reliability at the sub-move level was assessed to determine the level of subjectivity in the annotation process. The three annotators achieved an average Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.978 (SPSS 23), indicating a high level of agreement. The remaining texts were then analyzed by one author and carefully reviewed by another author. All the samples from the physics and engineering disciplines were also initially annotated by one researcher and subsequently reviewed by another, utilizing the same framework. Both researchers confirmed that the framework was sufficiently comprehensive to encompass the samples, even though not all labels were applied.

The three annotators tried to apply Santos’ (1996) move structure model to the texts, and held several extensive meetings to discuss changes to the move structure model and to reconcile any differences in their individual analyses of the 32 abstracts. It was found that minor modifications were required for Move 1 (Contextualizing the research) and Move 2 (Introducing the research), with the removal of three sub-moves since they were not present in the corpus data. All differences identified were collaboratively resolved by the four researchers in a series of extensive team discussions.

As evident from Table 4, the Chi-square test4 showed statistically significant differences in the frequency of occurrence between Move 1, Move 3, and Move 5 across the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts (GPT) and the Corpus of HumanGenerated Review Article Abstracts (H). This finding indicates that the overall distribution of the moves in review article abstracts across the two corpora is fairly different. Specifically, Move 1 (Situating the research), Move 3 (Describing the methodology), and

Note: F(GPT) and F(H) refer to the move frequency in the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts (GPT) and the Corpus of HumanGenerated Review Article Abstracts (H). $\% ( \mathrm { G P T } )$ and $\% ( \mathrm { H } )$ represent the percentages of move usage in two different corpora, GPT and H. χ2 refers to the Chi-square test value. S(p) stands for the p value. The asterisks $( ^ { * } )$ indicate significance level: $( ^ { * } )$ means statistically significant at the 0.05 level; $( ^ { * * } )$ means statistically significant at the 0.01 level; $( ^ { \ast \ast \ast \ast } )$ means statistically significant at the 0.001 level. The $+ \gamma$ ” and “-” signs on the right side indicate “overuse” and “underuse”.

Move 5 (Discussing the research) occurred with significantly different frequencies in the two types of abstracts.

The findings suggest that there are discernible and statistically significant patterns in the ways that ChatGPT and humans write abstracts. In other words, even though both humans and ChatGPT were capable of writing review article abstracts, their respective methodologies were not identical. There existed substantial and statistically significant differences in their writing styles or strategies, as evidenced by the different frequencies of usage of Move 1, Move 3, and Move 5.

However, no significant differences were found in Move 2 (Presenting the research) and Move 4 (Summarizing the results) across the two corpora. This indicates both humans and ChatGPT are more likely to use similar move structures when presenting research and summarizing results in review articles abstracts.

Table 5 provides an overview of the distribution of sub-moves across the two corpora.

Considerable variations were found in using sub-moves to fulfill the rhetorical functions in the two corpora. Specifically, in terms of the use of sub-move 1A (Stating current knowledge), sub-move 1B (Stating a problem) and sub-move 2B (Indicating main purpose), there was a significantly lower occurrence in the ChatGPT-generated abstracts, while there was a notably higher occurrence in the human-written abstracts. Conversely, in terms of the usage of sub-move 2A (Indicating main features), sub-move 5A (Drawing conclusions) and sub-move 5B (Giving recommendations), there was a significantly higher occurrence in the ChatGPT-generated abstracts, while there was a notably lower occurrence in the human-written abstracts. For example.

(1) Since the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, the educational trajectories of children with disabilities have increasingly become the focus of public interest and the subject of empirical research … [Sub-move 1A: Stating current knowledge)] Yet a systematic overview of current research in this area is not available. [Sub-move 1B: Stating a problem)] (Education by Humans)   
(2) This comprehensive review examines the relationship between local food movements and the construction of identity. The analysis encompasses various scholarly perspectives … Additionally, the paper examines the role of local food in addressing social issues, … The conclusion emphasizes the complexity of defining local food … [Sub-move 2A: Indicating main features)] (Anthropology by ChatGPT)

This indicates that the algorithm used to generate review article abstracts by ChatGPT does not fully replicate human writing patterns. Specifically, ChatGPT failed to describe the background information of the review topic, to acknowledge knowledge gaps, or to state the aims of the study adequately. It also overstated or overstressed the summary or main content of the article, the value of the research and the potential applications and recommendations for future research.

The percentage of each move in the 160 abstracts in the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts was calculated to determine the obligatory and optional moves. As mentioned above, for a move to be classified as obligatory, it needs to be present in $5 0 \%$ of the 160 abstracts in the corpus. A move might be deemed optional if its occurrence is less than $5 0 \%$ . The results showed that the obligatory moves in ChatGPT-generated abstracts were Move 1 $( 1 0 7 . 5 0 \% )$ ) and Move 5 $( 9 6 . 2 5 \% )$ ), while the optional moves were Move 1 $( 4 5 . 6 3 \% )$ ), Move 3 $( 1 5 . 0 0 \% )$ ), and Move 4 $( 4 2 . 5 0 \% )$ . However, the obligatory moves in human-written abstracts were Move 1 $( 1 0 6 . 2 5 \% )$ and Move 2 $( 1 0 6 . 8 8 \% )$ , while the optional moves were Move 3 $( 2 8 . 1 3 \% )$ ), Move 4 $( 3 7 . 5 0 \% )$ , and Move 5 $( 3 6 . 2 5 \% )$ . This suggests that the typical order of the moves in a ChatGPT-generated or a human-written review article abstract based on the move sequence patterns identified in the corpora can be described as follows (the bracketed elements and plus signs between them describe the typical order of the functional units, the parentheses indicate optional moves):

ChatGPT-generated Abstracts: M1 [(Situating the research)] $+ \mathbf { M } \mathbf { 2 }$ [Presenting the research] + M3 [(Describing the method$\mathbf { 0 } ] \mathbf { o g y } ) ] + \mathbf { M } 4$ [(Summarizing the results) ${ \bf \Lambda } ] + { \bf M } { \bf 5 }$ [Discussing the research] Human-generated Abstracts: M1 [Situating the research] $+ \mathbf { M } \mathbf { 2 }$ [Presenting the research] $^ +$ M3 [(Describing the methodol$0 8 9 ] + \mathbf { M } 4$ [(Summarizing the results)] $+ \mathbf { M } 5$ [(Discussing the research)]

As demonstrated in Table 6, there were substantial differences in using moves and sub-moves within the discipline of anthropology. Specifically, the use of sub-move 1A (Stating current knowledge), sub-move 1B (Stating a problem), and Move 4 (Summarizing the results), was noticeably less frequent in the ChatGPT-created abstracts compared to the human-written ones, showing a substantially higher occurrence of these elements. Conversely, the utilization of sub-move 5A (Drawing conclusions) was distinctly more prevalent in the ChatGPT-produced abstracts. This implies that in generating review article abstracts in the field of anthropology, ChatGPT is not sufficient in accurately depicting the research topic’s background information, acknowledging contentious arguments or knowledge gaps, or summarizing the results, and it over-highlighted the significance of the research.

A summary of how sub-moves were distributed within the two kinds of review article abstract corpora in education is provided in Table 7.

Table 7 shows significant differences in the utilization of moves and sub-moves in the field of education. More specifically, the application of sub-move 1A (Stating current knowledge), sub-move 1B (Stating a problem), sub-move 2B (Indicating main purpose), and Move 3 (Describing the methodology) was noticeably less frequent in the abstracts generated by ChatGPT, while these elements were considerably more common in the abstracts created by humans. This suggests ChatGPT faces difficulties in offering relevant background information on the research subject, recognizing knowledge deficiencies, efficiently summarizing the results, or possibly neglecting the methodology when generating review article abstracts in education.

Table 8 provides a summary of how sub-moves were distributed within the two corpora of physics review article abstracts.

Table 8 illustrates significant disparities solely in the use of sub-moves in the field of physics. With regards to the application of submove 5A (Drawing conclusions), a significantly greater frequency was observed in the ChatGPT-generated abstracts, in contrast to a notably lesser frequency in abstracts written by humans. This implies that ChatGPT tends to focus more on drawing conclusions compared to human-written abstracts when producing physics review article abstracts. For example.

Table 9 presents an overview of the distribution of moves and sub-moves between the two kinds of engineering review article abstract corpora.

As illustrated in Table 9, there were notable differences in the use of moves and sub-moves in the field of engineering. When it comes to the application of Move 4 (Summarizing the results), sub-move 5A (Drawing conclusions), and sub-move 5B (Giving recommendations), a significantly greater frequency was observed in the ChatGPT-generated abstracts. This indicates that ChatGPTgenerated abstracts are more likely to summarize results, draw conclusions, and provide recommendations more frequently than human-written engineering review article abstracts.

In conclusion, these findings suggest that the large language model (ChatGPT) exhibits limitations when generating review article abstracts across various fields. In anthropology and education, ChatGPT did not sufficiently depict the research topic’s background or acknowledge contentious arguments or knowledge gaps. It also tended to overstate the significance of the research. In physics and engineering, ChatGPT prioritized drawing conclusions, summarizing results, and offering recommendations, and this indicates that there are stylistic or structural differences between the large language model and human writing.

4.3. The sequential order of the moves and the sub-moves across GPT and H in RA abstracts

Table 10 provides a summary of move sequences across GPT and H in review article abstracts.

It is evident that typical abstracts written by humans follow a 2-move sequence (M1-M2) or a 5-move sequence (M1-M2-M3-M4- M5). In contrast, typical abstracts generated by ChatGPT adhere to a 2-move sequence (M2-M5) or a 3-move sequence (M1-M2-M5). For example.

In other words, the machine-generated abstracts and human-authored abstracts displayed different move structure patterns. Humans were more likely to use a more elaborate sequence, incorporating all five moves in some cases. On the other hand, the large language model seemed to favor simpler, shorter move sequences, possibly omitting or overlooking certain moves or sub-moves. This indicates that ChatGPT does not fully capture the complexity and nuance often present in human-written review article abstracts. Fourteen distinct move sequence patterns were observed in the ChatGPT-generated abstracts, while the human-written abstracts exhibited 26 move sequence patterns. Accordingly, the human-written abstracts demonstrated a greater diversity in their move sequence patterns compared to the ChatGPT-generated abstracts.

Table 11 displays the results obtained from the move sequence pattern analysis in two hard science disciplines, i.e., physics and engineering in H.

Eight and eleven different move sequence patterns were identified in these two disciplines. SM1A-SM2A was the most used move sequence in these two kinds of review article abstracts, and consisted of the sub-move 1A (Stating current knowledge) and sub-move 2A (Indicating main features). In other words human scholars in those two disciplines preferred to present the background information and demonstrate the main content or the scope of their review articles. The preference of human scholars to display this information in their abstracts might be due to the influence of disciplinary cultures, or to their knowledge of the genre of the review article. In summary, in physics and engineering, human researchers tended to favor a more detailed, context-oriented approach when writing review article abstracts.

Table 12 shows the result of an analysis of move sequence patterns in H within the two soft science disciplines, specifically, anthropology and education.

We identified 21 and 29 different move sequence patterns in these two disciplines, respectively. As can be seen from Table 12, within the abstracts of review articles from anthropology and education, the most commonly employed move sequences were SM1ASM2A and SM1A-SM1B-SM2B-M3-M4-SM5A, respectively. This implies that human reviewers in anthropology are more likely to present the background or the context of the topic in question and tend to provide the summary of the content or the overview of topics dealt with in the review. When it comes to education review articles, human writers preferred to provide a more structured abstract, covering the background, the knowledge gap or the niche, the aims, the methodology, the results and the significance of the review topic.

Furthermore, as can be seen from Tables 11 and 12, there were more diversified move sequence patterns in the soft disciplines in comparison with those patterns in the hard disciplines, which indicates that human reviewers in the soft disciplines are more likely to organize the structure of the review article abstracts in a flexible way.

# 4.4. Move embedding across GPT and H in RA abstracts

Move embedding refers to the blending of moves into the same statement (Santos, 1996). We identified 5 embedded moves in ChatGPT-generated review article abstracts and 22 in human-written ones. In the ChatGPT-generated abstracts, most fully embedded moves $( \mathrm { N } \ : = \ : 5 $ ) were composed of Move 2 (Presenting the research) and Move 3 (Describing the methodology). In the human-written abstracts, most of the fully embedded moves $( \mathrm { N } = 1 0 )$ ) also consisted of Move 2 and Move 3. Moreover, Move 3 and Move 4 (Summarizing the results) were frequently embedded together $\left( \mathrm { N } = 6 \right)$ ) in the abstracts written by humans. The Chi-square test demonstrated statistically significant differences in the frequency of move embedding between the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts and the Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts $( \chi 2 = 1 0 . 3 6$ , $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 1 } \end{array}$ ). This implies that move embedding occurs significantly less frequently in review article abstracts generated by ChatGPT compared to those produced by humans. It also suggests that ChatGPT generates simpler or more straightforward sentence structures compared to human writers when producing abstracts. For example.

# 5. Discussion

Our research primarily focused on comparing the rhetorical moves in review article abstracts generated by ChatGPT versus those written by humans across four soft and hard science disciplines, attempting to identify their similarities and differences, along with an evaluation of ChatGPT’s performance and efficiency in generating these abstracts. One of the important findings reveals that the overall pattern of moves in review article abstracts varied considerably between the Corpus of ChatGPT-Generated Review Article Abstracts and the Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts. Move 1 (i.e. Situating the research), Move 3 (i.e. Describing the methodology), and Move 5 (i.e. Discussing the research) occurred with markedly different frequencies in the two kinds of abstracts. On the other hand, no notable differences were observed in Move 2 (i.e. Presenting the research) and Move 4 (i.e. Summarizing the results) across the two corpora. This indicates that both humans and the large language model demonstrate similarities when presenting research and summarizing results in review article abstracts, but might differ in presenting the background, describing the methodology, and discussing the results. Another intriguing finding was that human writers often used a more comprehensive move sequence pattern, at times including all five moves, whereas ChatGPT preferred less complicated and shorter move sequences, possibly omitting some moves or sub-moves. This finding partially supports the assumption that the writing practices in different disciplines are influenced by disciplinary cultures, social contexts, recontextualization, the authors’ partly language-dependent genre-specific knowledge and language-independent metacognitive genre awareness (Hyland, 2000, 2004; Johns, 2008; Martin & Rose, 2008; Swales, 1990). In fact, this result echoes another finding that move embedding occurs significantly less often in review article abstracts generated by ChatGPT compared to those written by humans. Since less move embedding might indicate less use of long complex sentences, the shorter move sequences in ChatGPT-generated abstracts suggest that fewer complex sentences are generated in review article abstracts generated by ChatGPT. There could be associations between specific types of syntactically complex structures and rhetorical moves within disciplinary contexts (Lu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023), which might indicate that the shorter move sequences in ChatGPT-generated texts are influenced by syntactic complexity. Therefore, it is possible that these shorter move sequences might be a consequence of the training textual data, which might contain fewer complex syntactic structures. Alternatively, they might be a consequence of ChatGPT’s lack of awareness of the relationships between particular types of complex sentence structures and rhetorical objectives in disciplinary contexts. In other words, it may be challenging for ChatGPT to combine different rhetorical moves into a single long complex sentence in a way that reflects local rhetorical aims or general context variations.

Note: SM refers to the sub-moves. F(HANT) and F(HEDU) refer to the frequency of move sequence patterns in anthropology and education of the Corpus of Human-Generated Review Article Abstracts (H). $\%$ (HANT) and $\% ( \mathrm { H E D U } )$ represent the percentages of move sequence patterns in anthropology and education of H.

Another important finding was that the ChatGPT-generated abstracts demonstrated less diversity in their move sequence patterns compared to the human-written abstracts. This result is consistent with prior findings on the performance of ChatGPT in generating academic journal articles (Gao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Specifically, abstracts produced by ChatGPT appear to be more ambiguous and standardized (Gao et al., 2023). Similarly, the abstracts generated by ChatGPT showed a high degree of uniformity and strong rationality, leaning towards academic discourse such as summaries (Wang et al., 2023). In contrast, abstracts written by human scholars displayed distinct individuality, frequently employing terms specific to certain research contexts and policy-related vocabulary. This might be due to human authors’ creative ability to adapt their writing style for different social contexts, or communicative purposes, whereas the machine-generated text might be more rigid or limited due to the programming or the sparsity of training data encountered by the large language model. Since ChatGPT is a kind of deep learning model (Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023), trained on a large dataset of text, such as books and articles, and it learns to generate text that is similar to the text it was trained on, it might suffer from some data training problems, such as limited training data, a lack of relevant data, model overfitting, and an unbalanced dataset (Bansal et al., 2022).

The most interesting finding was that the majority of fully embedded moves were comprised of Move 2 (i.e. Presenting the research) and Move 3 (i.e. Describing the methodology) in the two corpora. This finding aligns with Santos’s (1996) research, which shows that Move 3 was frequently merged with Move 2, either partially or entirely. The embedding of two or more moves was a common phenomenon across all five moves of the abstract.

# 6. Conclusion and implications

This study annotated a corpus of 320 review article abstracts generated by ChatGPT and human writers in four soft and hard science disciplines, aiming to assess the performance and efficiency of ChatGPT in generating academic texts. Our results reveal significant differences in the types of rhetorical moves, move patterns, and frequency of move embedding between abstracts generated by ChatGPT and those authored by humans. This broadens the use of move analysis to the abstracts of review articles generated by ChatGPT and human authors in both soft and hard disciplines, thereby enhancing our understanding of how abstract writing practices in various disciplines could be affected by factors such as disciplinary cultures, social contexts, the authors’ genre knowledge, etc. The insights from this research contribute to understanding the review genre in academic writing and underscore the degree to which move analysis provides a comprehensive view of the structural patterns of a review article abstract. In addition to its theoretical contributions to discourse analysis, this research has practical benefits for improving text generation capabilities of large language models and for genre-based EAP pedagogy. For instance, the pedagogical implications would be that teachers specializing in genre-based EAP pedagogy can assist novice or non-native writers in recognizing the typical features of rhetorical moves in review article abstracts. Instructing students to focus on Move 1 [Situating the Research] is particularly important, as ChatGPT may not effectively convey the research topic’s background or identify knowledge gaps. Proficient human writers are more likely to surpass ChatGPT in writing Move 1.

The present study was subject to several limitations, the principal limitation being that we only examined a limited number of review articles from the two hard and two soft disciplines. Another limitation arises from the absence of relevant prior studies directly based on the analytical framework used in this study for these two types of journal review article abstracts. This means that it is unlikely to take into account the effect size of our results. Future studies could cover more disciplines and consider the distinctions in sub-types of review articles and structured and unstructured abstracts. Grammatical metaphor and stance markers are further factors which might be used to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in generating academic texts.

Our analyses suggest that ChatGPT should not be used to generate review article abstracts, for it cannot fully demonstrate the move structure of the genre. Specifically, ChatGPT cannot generate some sub-moves, such as the sub-move: Stating a problem, and shows less diversity in move patterns and less flexibility in the sequencing of moves. This undermines ChatGPT’s capability in generating review article abstracts.
