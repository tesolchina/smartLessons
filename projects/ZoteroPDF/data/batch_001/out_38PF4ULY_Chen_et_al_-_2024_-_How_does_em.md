# ABSTRACT

It is well known that teachers’ feedback plays an important role in students’ learning, as it enhances learners’ cognitive development; yet there has been little research on how positive feedback given in the form of emojis works in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) courses. In this study, an experiment was designed to clarify how English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ emotions are affected when such feedback is presented (no feedback vs. supraliminal feedback vs. subliminal feedback) and to examine how the feedback correlates with their learning effectiveness. A within-subject experiment with 33 participants was designed and administered to examine three proposed research hypotheses. Participants’ frontal asymmetry alpha (FAA) and their recollection of the learning contents were used as the index of their emotional valence and learning effectiveness. The results revealed that positive feedback given in the form of emojis generated a positive/approach emotion when it was shown subliminally. Furthermore, a significant relationship was seen between EFL learners’ positive emotion and their learning effectiveness; such a finding was supported by the significant relationship between the modes of emoji presentation and the participants’ learning effectiveness. This study’s originality and value lies in the innovative research method that was adopted and the interesting findings that it yielded. The limitations of this study such as research design and sampling are reported. The study also has practical and theoretical implications for practitioners and scholars of CALL for praxis and future research.

# Introduction

Providing feedback to English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners is one of the critical tasks of EFL teachers (Xu et  al., 2021), and empirical evidence from an experimental study shows that learners with teachers’ feedback (vs. feedback from peers or no feedback at all) made significant improvement in L2 learners’ lexical stress perception skills (Sippel & Martin, 2022). Furthermore, teachers’ feedback can also enhance learners’ cognitive development through scaffolding (Kim & Kim, 2020; Vygotsky & Cole, 1980); therefore, lack of feedback from the teacher would eventually lead to ineffective teaching in English-medium instruction (EMI) courses ( $\mathrm { K i m } \ \&$ Tatar, 2017). Some scholars such as Lawton et  al. (2012) state that ‘instruction without embedded feedback can be disconnected and irrelevant’ (p. 104), which may not be beneficial for learning outcomes. Nevertheless, most previous research of EFL education focused on teachers’ corrective feedback in EFL/ESL output tasks, such as writing and oral assignments (Han & Hyland, 2019; Kim & Kim, 2020), pertinent research on the influence of encouraging feedback (also known as positive feedback; see Yang et  al. (2019)) from the teacher on EFL learners’ input tasks remains limited.

With the development of information communication technologies (ICTs), young learners nowadays prefer socializing and interacting with their friends, classmates, or even strangers via social media compared to traditional interactions in person, and such a tendency has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (Callender et  al., 2022; Chen, 2022). When talking about online interpersonal communication, emojis have been considered to have emotional and semantic functions in computer-mediated communication (CMC) (Yang et  al., 2022). As such, emojis can play a critical role in CMC by replacing the conventional nonverbal cues in face-to-face (FtF) communication (Bai et  al., 2019; Boutet et  al., 2021; Cohn et  al., 2018; He, 2022; Hsieh & Tseng, 2017; Maa & Taguchi, 2022; Tang & Hew, 2022; Tang et  al., 2021; Weissman & Tanner, 2018). Emojis, the pictographic unicorn characters that have become commonplace in everyday communication in the recent years (Pohl et  al., 2017), can be substitutes for nonverbal communication because they can be used to ‘depict a myriad of different facial expressions with varying levels of detail’ (Holtgraves & Robinson, 2020, p. 2). As the use of emojis for CMC has gained popularity, scholars (Boutet et  al., 2021; Holtgraves & Robinson, 2020; Weissman & Tanner, 2018) have pointed out that more empirical evidence is needed to explore how emojis can be used meaningfully in CMC. Moreover, their importance in online education cannot and should not be overlooked. As Sharef et  al. (2019) points out, ‘emoji should be integrated into educational communication because of their potential to enhance social constructivist pedagogy’ (p. 104). The effectiveness of using emojis to facilitate communication between teachers and students has been confirmed (Crombie, 2020). Nevertheless, the benefits of using emojis as feedback in the context of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) for L2 learners remain unknown. The question of how such subliminally presented feedback would work in the context of CALL also merits further investigation.

According to Webster’s dictionary, the term subliminal means ‘existing or functioning below the threshold of conscious perception’ (Shukla, 2022, p. 4359). Subliminal messages were found to be able to influence one’s emotions, decisions, and actions (Ruch et  al., 2016), whereas supraliminal stimuli refer to those that can be consciously attended by the receivers (Capa et  al., 2011). Evidence from cognitive science confirmed that one’s perception, evaluation, and motivation can be manipulated without one’s conscious awareness (Mudrik et  al., 2022; Zhu et  al., 2022). A growing body of research in various fields has reported how subliminal messages are used to influence one’s beliefs, attitudes, and behavior (Bargh, 2022). In the field of educational research, Arslan et  al. (2017) postulated that subliminal messaging can be beneficial for students’ learning if administered properly; nevertheless, the effectiveness of subliminal messages/stimuli in the field of education is still under-explored (Zdravkovska et  al., 2021). Based on this, we aimed to extend this stream of research on the influence of emoji feedback presented supraliminally and subliminally (which means consciously and unconsciously, respectively; see Meneguzzo et  al., 2014) in CALL settings.

Emotion is the human state that responds to stimuli or situations that an individual perceives (Lee et  al., 2020). It is considered to play a vital role in students’ learning (Ali & Tan, 2022; Ding & Zhao, 2020) and thus is a valid determinant of their academic performance (Tzafilkou et  al., 2021). In second language acquisition (SLA), positive emotions can contribute to language learners acquiring the target language; such a tendency is also found in the case of CALL (Kruk & Pawlak, 2022). Emotions can be measured by three approaches: self-reporting, behavior observation, and psychophysiological measures (Bastiaansen et  al., 2022). Smith et  al. (2017) stated that using electroencephalogram (hereafter, EEG) to measure one’s emotion and motivation through frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has become a norm across various fields of research (Zhao et al., 2018). The validity of using frontal alpha brainwave $( 8 - 1 3 \mathrm { H z } )$ to measure one’s emotions has been confirmed, as the left frontal hemispheric alpha oscillation indicates approach-oriented emotions while the right frontal hemispheric alpha oscillation indicates withdrawal-oriented emotions (Metzen et  al., 2022; Quaedflieg et  al., 2016; Zhao et  al., 2018).

In this study, the FAA technique was used to measure EFL learners’ emotions when they are given subliminal and supraliminal emojis as feedback and investigate the impact of emojis as feedback presented differently (supraliminal vs. subliminal vs. no feedback) on their learning effectiveness for CALL. To extend the current understanding of this topic, a within-subjects experiment was conducted. In this study, the dependent variable EFL was the learners’ learning effectiveness, i.e., the learners’ assessment of their understanding of the content (Chen et  al., 2022) from the CALL lessons, which was measured directly after each session with fill-in questions.

# Literature review

# Emojis in CALL

The use of emojis as a form of nonverbal communication to convey emotional and pragmatic information has become common practice in digital interactions (Cohn et  al., 2018). Callender et  al. (2022) investigated how the use of emojis in education promotes students’ well-being. Their research showed that positive emojis evoked positive emotions in healthcare students. Studies also found that positive emojis were beneficial in facilitating communication and expressing feelings in digital interactions (Bailey & Almusharraf, 2021; Boutet et  al., 2021; Lyu & Lai, 2022). Emojis can also be used to construe attitude (He, 2022). In the Asian context, particularly in the Japanese culture (see Sakai (2013) for review), where a high language context would require extra contextual information to increase the comprehensibility of communication, emojis are commonly used for self-expression without causing a negative effect such as losing face (Maa & Taguchi, 2022). Furthermore, Luo and Gao (2022) revealed that emojis were used by the participants of their telecollaboration project on intercultural learning to mitigate misunderstanding and to enhance intercultural communication. Similar results have been reported by Chen et  al. (2021) and Tong et  al. (2022). The former discovered that the use of emojis enabled language learners to communicate with their peers light-heartedly in an online Chinese-as-a-foreign-language (CFL) class while the latter confirmed that CFL teachers’ use of emojis can soften the tone when communicating with their nonnative Chinese students. Hence, using emojis in online communication or learning contexts holds promise in terms of building a friendly atmosphere when communicating with others in a foreign language.

# Neuroscientific research on emoji feedback

Most prior research in this field has been on the presentation of emojis in communication and how such presentations affected the brain’s neural activities as measured by event-response potentials (ERPs) (Churches et  al., 2014; Cohn et  al., 2018; Holtgraves & Robinson, 2020; Weissman & Tanner, 2018; Weiß et  al., 2020) and fMRI (Kim et  al., 2016). These neuroscientific studies indicate that the stimuli of emojis and real faces are processed similarly by our brain (Moffitt et  al., 2021); specifically, when people use emoji faces in CMC, the receivers’ neural responses are similar to those in the situation of FtF communication (Gantiva et  al., 2020). Additional information from the study by Weiß et  al. (2020), which examined participants’ neural and behavioral responses when they were in the ultimate game, revealed that although the acceptance rate was similar in both, that is, when they received feedback from human face and through emojis, the latter triggered more N170 and N2 brain potentials thus echoing the results of Churches et  al. (2014). N170 and N2 (or N200) are two components of ERPs, which refer to a negative deflection in the brain wave amplitude that occurs around $1 7 0 \mathrm { m s }$ and $2 0 0 \mathrm { m } s$ , respectively, after the presentation of a stimulus (Cashon & Holt, 2015). N170 is sensitive to faces (Rossion & Jacques, 2008), and N2 can be used as a mismatch detector (Folstein & Van Petten, 2008). Churches et  al. (2014) further revealed that when the emojis were presented in inverted form, significant differences were discovered in the participants’ N170 and N2. Furthermore, comparing the neural mechanisms triggered when encountering emojis versus words, Weissman and Tanner (2018) report that wink emojis used to express irony would generally render identical neural activities as when the same meaning was expressed in words. Through an examination of brainwave power bands, Nurhadi and Saifullah (2021) reported that an increase of alpha brainwaves and decrease of beta brainwaves can both be generated by supraliminal and subliminal stimuli. However, neuroscientific evidence is insufficient about how we process feedback received in the form of digital communication through an emoji, and not from a human face (Rúa-Hidalgo et  al., 2021), particularly when this communication or interaction is meant for EFL learning.

# Subliminal and supraliminal stimuli

When a person processes information, both the processing of information and the information content itself can be either conscious or unconscious; the first is supra-subliminal and the second subliminal (Lemnaru, 2013). Arslan et  al. (2017) claimed that the use of subliminal messages/ stimuli has been used in various fields, including education. Educational research on the effectiveness of subliminal stimuli has acknowledged that when subliminal stimuli are used to convey new information that goes beyond the learners’ explicit learning system, their implicit learning system would take over the processing of subliminal messages/stimuli (Authors, 2022). Züst et  al. (2019) posited that when people are awake, they are able to undertake rapid relational encoding extracted from subliminal stimuli. Supraliminal stimuli can activate well-known behavioral and neural responses that may differ when the stimuli are subliminally presented (Bareither et  al., 2014). Therefore, the effectiveness of subliminal stimuli has always been an appealing topic of research (Authors, 2022; Pavlevchev et  al., 2022).

Prior empirical works (Authors, 2022; Frumento et  al., 2021; Madan et  al., 2021; Mudrik et  al., 2022; Williams et  al., 2004; Winkielman & Berridge, 2004) have reported that subliminal stimuli can induce significant effects on the recipient’s behavior and brain activity. One group of researchers documented the differences in brain activity evoked by supraliminal and subliminal stimuli (Kouider et  al., 2007). Another study by Williams et  al. (2004) used ERP to unveil subliminal and supraliminal fear faces that would elicit temporal difference in ERP activity (subliminal for $3 0 0 \mathrm { m } s$ after the onset of stimuli and supraliminal for $4 0 0 \mathrm { m } s \mathrm { ) }$ ). However, Schlaghecken and Eimer (2004) argue that subliminal stimuli work only when a person is ready to perform a specific action. Research on the effects of subliminal stimuli on an individual’s learning effectiveness is still ongoing (Elgendi et  al., 2018; Kreiner et  al., 2003) even though it has been stated that learning can still be activated when the stimuli are presented subliminally (Seitz, 2021). For example, Chalfoun and Frasson (2008) posited that subliminal stimuli used in a $_ { 3 \mathrm { D } }$ virtual tutoring system enhances learning and leads to better performance among learners. Similarly, Zdravkovska et  al. (2021) used subliminal stimuli in visual cues to motivate three groups of learners (children, teenagers, and adults) in their learning. Their results indicated that subliminal stimuli play a promising role in improving learners’ memory and hence help them achieve their educational goals. Moreover, a recent study by Authors (2022) has shown that subliminal and supraliminal stimuli of feedback are equally effective in increasing the self-efficacy of EFL learners. However, the above studies used behavioral data as the dependent variable to determine how subliminal stimuli affect their participants’ learning, including memory, self-efficacy, and performance. To the best of our knowledge, research using a neuroscience approach to investigate the role of subliminal and supraliminal stimuli in EFL learners’ participation in CALL courses and/or lessons is still limited.

# Frontal alpha asymmetry theory and academic performance

The concept of frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) was advanced by Richard J. Davidson (1979) after observing that participants’ preference for a TV program was positively related to the alpha brain spectral power or activity in the left frontal lobe; likewise, their negative feelings were associated with alpha activity in the right frontal lobe. Within the realm of educational research, gaining knowledge about the neural underpinnings of learners’ responses to learning materials and instructional activities will benefit both learners and the teacher (Müller et  al., 2018). Based on these discoveries, it has been posited that a relatively greater activation of alpha brainwaves in the left frontal lobe can be triggered by approach-related emotions whereas greater brainwaves in the right frontal lobe can be activated by withdrawal-related emotions (Briesemeister et  al., 2013; Lacey & Gable, 2021; Lee et  al., 2020; Poole & Gable, 2014). Metzen et  al. (2022) suggested that ‘positive LQ (FAA) values represent higher relative right alpha power (left activity), while negative LQ values represent higher relative left alpha power (right activity)’ (p. 725). In other words, higher FAA indicates greater left hemisphere cortical activity associated with positive emotions (Cheung et  al., 2019; Choi et  al., 2016), lower anxiety (Mennella et  al., 2017), and greater achievement motivation (Müller et  al., 2018). According to Chen et  al. (2019), individuals with high FAA tend to have persistent emotional and motivational states that help them overcome obstacles and achieve planned goals. Such traits have been shown to be closely related to an individual’s performance (Beik et  al., 2022), including academic performance (Camacho-Morles et  al., 2021). Ulrich et  al. (2021) also pointed out that an individual’s academic performance is often used in educational technology research as an assessment of their learning effectiveness. In summary, this study used EFL learners’ FAA as an indicator of positive emotions and motivation to examine their academic performance in terms of learning effectiveness when using different presentations of feedback (supraliminal vs. subliminal vs. no feedback) in CALL courses.

Based on the conceptualization of the relationship between learners’ emotions and performance and learning (Chen & Sun, 2012; Chen & Wang, 2011; Immordino-Yang & Damasio, 2007), extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between a person’s FAA and the different types of stimuli they receive. Nevertheless, a person’s frontal alpha oscillation response to subliminal stimuli, especially in the specific context of CALL, remains unclear. To date, there has been a dearth of direct evidence regarding FAA to confirm the relationship between EFL learners’ emotions and learning outcomes. This study adopted an experimental method to explore this under-researched issue.

# Hypotheses development

Based on the proposed research questions, reviewed literature, and the identified research gap, the following research hypotheses are presented:

RH1: A significant difference is seen in EFL learners’ FAA when positive emoji feedback is presented differently (supraliminal vs. subliminal vs. no feedback) in the context of CALL.

RH2: EFL learners’ FAA is significantly correlated to the learning effectiveness in CALL.

RH3: Modes of emoji presentation bear a significant relationship with EFL learners’ learning effectiveness in CALL.

# Methodology

The protocol of FAA analysis proposed by Briesemeister et  al. (2013) was adopted in this study. Four steps were administered to retrieve the EEG data. First, raw EEG data were collected from electrodes placed on the prefrontal cortex, which were then transformed into spectral power by Fourier transform. Second, only alpha band power was captured because of the assumption that in alpha reverse (Allen et  al., 2004; Park et  al., 2021), a greater alpha brainwave meant decreased cortical activation. Third, natural-log transform was performed to obviate the effects of positive skewness and kurtosis. The last step was to calculate the FAA metric by estimating right-hemispheric alpha power minus left hemispheric alpha power (Fp1/Fp2 were used for further analysis, Hafeez et  al., 2019). Furthermore, current source density (CSD)-transformed data (i.e., the potential mode measured as voltage, which was captured and detected as a surface charge mode obtained by Laplacian estimates; see Dimpfel et  al. (2012) for details) were used in statistical analyses, as these data are considered more accurate for FAA (also see Smith et  al., 2017). To prevent any misinterpretation of meaning that emojis may carry, as reported by Weissman and Tanner (2018), this study adopted emojis that are widely used as positive message icons in online communication, which ‘express positive emotions such as happiness, joy, excitement, etc.,’ as suggested by Bai et  al. (2019, p. 8) (See Figure 1 for the emojis used in this experiment). More importantly, the design and implementation of this research follow the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration. Originally developed in 1964 for the medical community by the World Medical Association (WMA), the Declaration of Helsinki is a set of ethical principles that concerns the issue of research ethics when human experimentation is undertaken. The study also obtained ethical approval from the University Human Research Ethics Committee (NCKU-HREC-E-109-093-2).

# Participants

The sample size was calculated using $\mathrm { G ^ { \ast } }$ Power 3.1.9.7, which was set for a medium effect size of .25, a significance level of .05, and a statistical power of .8. The suggested minimum sample size of repeated-measures ANOVA was 30. To test the three different contexts (no stimuli vs. supraliminal stimuli vs. subliminal stimuli) randomly, 33 EFL learners from a national university in southern Taiwan were recruited as the research participants (15 male and 18 female, mean $\mathsf { a g e } = 2 1 . 4 _ { \cdot }$ $\operatorname* { m i n } { } = 1 9$ , $\mathrm { \ m a x } = 2 6 )$ . They were selected based on the following criteria: (a) as assessed by the Edinburgh inventory (Oldfield, 1971), they were right-handed, (b) had no history of any neurological illness or brain damage, and (c) were not under any psychoactive medication when the experiment was conducted. Selected participants were asked to provide their written consent on a form and were given a small cash incentive (around USD $\$ 10$ ) in return for their participation.

# Procedure

After obtaining the necessary consent from the participants, they were invited to a sound-attenuated laboratory and made to sit in front of a 21-inch computer screen, which was at their eye level and at a distance of $1 0 0 \mathrm { c m }$ . The stimuli were presented to them on the screen. Four one-minute baseline periods were administered before the lesson started. During the baseline period, they were asked to close and open their eyes for one minute each, which was confirmed as the duration required to obtain a reliable baseline measure of FAA (Chueh et  al., 2021; Smith et  al., 2017). In the session where they had to keep their eyes open, the participants were told to gaze fixedly at a black spot on the monitor against a white background, while they were asked to simply close their eyes during the eyes-closed session.

To prevent any carryover effect in this within-subject experiment designed for individuals to receive multiple stimuli (Smith et  al., 2017), the order of stimuli (i.e., supraliminal, subliminal, and no feedback) that each individual would receive was counterbalanced and the intervals of at least one week were maintained between different sessions. Regarding subliminal stimuli, which can be presented in different forms, namely ‘low intensity of a stimulus under the absolute minimum sensorial limit; the short time of representation (milliseconds); the masking of the target stimulus’ (Lemnaru, 2013, p. 965), the present study used subliminal stimuli presented in the short presentation time. As such, the presentations of emoji as feedback were either subliminal $( 1 \mathrm { m } s )$ or supraliminal $( 4 0 \mathrm { m } s )$ as suggested by Pavlevchev et  al. (2022). The proportions and contents of subliminal and supraliminal stimuli were constant, as Rúa-Hidalgo et  al. (2021) suggests that the proportion of emoji would cause different psychophysiological measures of valence about the emoji in the viewers. After all the control variables were controlled and the participants’ cortical activities were detected and captured by EEG, the online English lesson would commence, which was a preparation class for the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC). The levels of difficulty of these three sessions were identical, and all participants went through all three sessions randomly. The only difference between these three sessions was the presentation of emoji feedback (see Figure 2). Each session lasted 10 minutes, followed by an assessment of recall of the content, i.e., the material that the participants had just learned in the lessons from CALL. For example, if they learned ‘raise money for charity’ in the lesson, they were asked to fill in the word ‘raise’ in the question, such as ‘_ _ money for charity.’ There was no limitation on time for this assessment (refer to Figure 3 for details) and for each lesson, 10 questions were designed for such assessments.

Figure 2. T he Screenshots of the CALL lessons with and without emoji feedback.

After each participant completed the experiment, they were asked to guess the research hypothesis of this experiment as a manipulation check (Hauser et  al., 2018); they were specifically asked, ‘What do you think about the purpose of this experiment?’ or ‘Can you guess the reason why you were invited to participate in this study?’ None of them could give the correct answer, confirming the robustness of this experimental design (Ozkara & Dogan, 2022).

# Measurement

Each participant’s EEG was recorded using an eight-channel EEG produced by Artise Biomedical Co., Ltd., Taiwan. Signals were collected consistently at $1 0 0 \mathrm { H z }$ while being filtered $\left( 0 . 1 { - } 2 0 \mathrm { H z } \right)$ to remove excessively deviated data (Ozkara & Dogan, 2022). Only data below 5 $\mathrm { k } \Omega$ were captured to ensure high-quality EEG. Participants’ FAA was calculated by averaging all the FAAs collected in the duration of each experiment. The measurement of the participants’ learning effectiveness was done with a series of fill-in questions framed on the contents they had just studied. According to Spitzer (2005), the effectiveness of learning refers to the desired outcome of learning, and ‘learning is only effective if it contributes to improved performance and organizational value’ (p. 57). Given Spitzer’s (2005) reasoning and the fact that these CALL lessons were aimed at preparing for the TOEIC, an assessment of the participants’ ability to engage with the content of what they had just learned would be appropriate. Moreover, Erhel and Jamet (2013) also used learners’ recall of the content to evaluate their learning effectiveness; hence, this study followed the same approach and assessed the participants’ recall of the content that they had just learned from the CALL course to reflect their learning effectiveness. The number of correct responses was counted and transformed on a scale of 10 as the index of their learning effectiveness. Specifically, the learning effectiveness of the participants who finished each session was evaluated using 10 fill-in questions, and they were expected to answer as many of the questions as possible. A score was given based on the number of correct answers that they had on a scale of 10.

# Results

The FAA of participants in three different conditions showed that only the subliminal emoji triggered their positive emotions, whereas the two other emoji triggered negative emotions (see Table 1 for detailed information). The first research hypothesis was examined with one-way ANOVA $\mathrm { D V } =$ the participants’ FAA; $\mathrm { { I V } = }$ the mode of stimuli). Results of ANOVA indicated a significant difference in participants’ FAA when stimuli were presented in three different modes $\left( F \left( 2 , 9 6 \right) = 4 . 3 0 1 \right.$ , $p = . 0 1 6$ ; see Table 1). The effect size $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 }$ was .08, indicating a medium to large effect (Norouzian & Plonsky, 2018), thus supporting RH1. Since the result of ANOVA was significant, an ad-hoc test was performed. As ‘Tukey’s HSD is probably the most recommended and used procedure for controlling Type I error rate when making multiple pairwise comparisons’ (Nanda et  al., 2021, p. 60), it was adopted for multiple comparisons, which revealed significant differences between the mean values of participants’ FAA when the emoji feedback was presented subliminally and supraliminally $\left( \boldsymbol { p } ^ { \mathbf { \lambda } } \right. =$ .019, $\mathrm { C . I . } = [ . 0 0 9 , . 1 2 7 ] )$ . The results of the post-hoc pairwise comparison reported in Table 2 reveal that participants’ FAA was significantly lower when the emoji feedback was presented supraliminally. However, no significant difference was seen when no emoji was presented at all and it was shown supraliminally and subliminally (see Table 3 for details).

According to the information conveyed by abovementioned tables, when the emoji feedback was subliminal, participants’ FAA was significantly higher than for that presented supraliminally. No significant difference was found between supraliminal/subliminal emoji and no emoji at all. As such, EFL learners’ positive emotion can be activated by subliminal emoji feedback.

Regarding the second research hypothesis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient test was applied, and the results revealed a small yet significant relationship between participants’ FAA and their learning outcomes in the online English lessons (i.e., the number of correct answers for each session’s fill-in questions; $r = . 2 1 6$ , $\mathnormal { p } = \mathnormal { . } 0 3 2 )$ , thus supporting RH2 as well. The third hypothesis was examined using the nonparametric chi-squared test because the variables were nominal ( $\mathrm { { I V } = }$ the mode of stimuli) and ordinal $\mathrm { D V } =$ participants’ number of correct answers to fill-in questions) (McHugh, 2013). The results were significant $( \chi ^ { 2 }$ (18) $= 5 1 . 0 2 0$ , $p = . 0 0 0 \mathrm { \ : }$ ). RH3 was supported and the correlation coefficient between modes of emoji presentation and participants’ learning effectiveness was strong (Cramer’s $V = . 5 0 8$ ; for more details, see Akoglu, 2018).

# Discussion, limitations, and implications

The landscape of educational praxis altered drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic as all courses were delivered online during this unprecedented crisis. Teachers’ primary task involved finding ways to facilitate digital interactions with students. Emojis are widely used in CMC to convey emotions and meanings, which are usually conveyed through facial expressions in FtF interactions. This study aimed to advance understanding on how the use of emojis for feedback in online settings would benefit EFL learners’ English learning.

As Ali and Tan (2022) emphasize, emotions play a critical role in learning. The emotional signal of an emoji in virtual environments such as social media can enhance group membership; hence, emojis can also be used as bondicons (bonding icons; He, 2022). Li and Yang (2018) further asserted the pragmatic functions of positive emojis in the context of CALL. Therefore, in online settings, emojis can produce positive emotions in EFL learners. The findings of this study are somewhat counterintuitive. First, the results revealed that participants’ FAA was significantly higher when a positive emoji was used to provide feedback subliminally than supraliminally, whereas no significant difference was discovered between subliminal presentation and no presentation of emoji at all. One possible explanation is that the use of emojis should be natural and not intentional, reminiscent of the old saying, ‘overdoing is worse than undoing’ (Xu, 2015). In other words, the use of emojis in feedback can distract learners and evoke negative emotions. As Tigwell and Flatla (2016) noted, negative consequences can occur when there is no bilateral understanding of how to interpret the use of emojis in communication. This can be further proved by the findings indicating that when the same emoji is presented supraliminally, participants’ FAA is significantly lower than that in the other two situations. Such a finding is not consistent with the results of Nurhadi and Saifullah (2021), who found that the alpha oscillations are reduced in a similar way when the stimuli are supraliminally and subliminally presented. This could be attributed to the differences in the research contexts.

As for the association of EFL learners’ positive emotion and their learning effectiveness, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient of this study confirmed a significant relationship between participants’ FAA and their EFL learning effectiveness. This supports the results of Li et  al. (2020), who showed that students’ positive emotion is a salient predictor of their academic performance because positive emotions enhance attention and strengthen learning motivation. Furthermore, Hill et  al. (2014) found that cortical activity in the left frontal lobe (e.g., positive FAA) is positively related to linguistic performance, which includes fluency and verbal learning and memory (Darestani et  al., 2020) and that linguistic performance may be a predictor of later academic performance (Austerberry et  al., 2022). Accordingly, a positive relationship between FAA, oral performance, and academic performance can be established. The underlying reason may be that learners’ outperformance is caused by higher self-esteem, which is indicated by positive FAA (Dziembowska et  al., 2021). The results of this research yield new insights that support and extend our knowledge of these aspects.

Another interesting finding is that the mode of positive feedback, through emoji presentation, is significantly correlated with participants’ learning effectiveness. Such a finding posits that the mode of feedback presentation does matter when the feedback is in the form of emojis. Considering the support for RH1, one may state that positive feedback in the form of emojis works best when presented subliminally in terms of EFL learners’ emotions and learning effectiveness. The findings of this study partly corroborate the results of Albarrak et  al. (2021), who reported that subliminal stimuli were indeed able to influence participants’ performance; however, the stimuli should be peripheral rather than focal, as presented in this study. In their study, the subliminal stimuli were presented at $\pm \nobreakspace \ 6 0 \nobreakspace$ degrees of visual angle away from the foveal vision. Contrarily, this study confirmed that the subliminal feedback of emojis that were presented in the participants’ foveal vision would still be able to influence not only participants’ behavior, as proposed by Hsu and Chen (2020), but also EFL learners’ learning effectiveness in CALL contexts.

# Limitations and directions for future studies

Since this study adopted a within-subject experiment to examine three research hypotheses, there are bound to be limitations as the design and implementation occurred within a laboratory setting where the variables are well-controlled. A major limitation is that only healthy university students were tested; therefore, caution is advised in generalizing these results. Future studies are recommended to be conducted in more realistic classroom settings. Another limitation of this study is the exclusion of feedback from the teacher, as the study design only included supraliminal and subliminal emoji feedback as stimuli for the experimental groups. In contrast, the control group received no stimuli at all. It is advisable to conduct further research to include a different type of feedback stimuli involving the teacher’s facial expressions, as teacher–student interactions can be the source of emotion (Li et  al., 2020). Furthermore, the measurement of EFL learners’ learning effectiveness was conducted based on responses to questions about the learning contents of online lessons, and the duration of each CALL lesson was only 10 minutes. Such a design and evaluation of learning effectiveness focused more on participants’ short-term memory. Although phonological short-term memory is vital for the acquisition of new vocabulary (Gathercole, 1999), more evidence is needed whether such effectiveness would last longer for the construction of more complex knowledge. Future studies are advised to shed light on this issue using longitudinal methods.

# Practical implications

It has been postulated that positive emojis may be able to evoke receivers’ perception of feedback provider’s positivity (Aritajati & Rosson, 2021); accordingly, EFL teachers may also prefer to take advantage of this fact and use emojis to facilitate their digital interactions. Nevertheless, this study suggests that the use of emojis as positive feedback should be done with caution. If the feedback is given supraliminally, some negative consequences of EFL learners’ emotions may be harnessed. Therefore, when online English courses are designed, it is advised to use subliminal emojis as positive feedback to benefit EFL learners’ emotions. As recommended by Riener et  al. (2011), subliminal stimuli are only beneficial in enhancing learning and helping learners improve their reasoning skills if they are carefully and intelligently constructed before being integrated into a course. Given the ‘new normal’ of post-pandemic online education in the future, more instructor–learner interactions may take place online, forgoing the benefits that would be achieved through FtF interactions (Stevens et  al., 2021). Teachers of CALL courses may consider embedding subliminal messages of positive emojis in their courses when difficult content is to be learned by students. Moreover, the feedback should be meaningful to learners, which means that the positive subliminal feedback should be given after they have attempted or completed difficult tasks because ‘misusing subliminal priming can lead to critical disruptions of ongoing tasks’ (Chalfoun & Frasson, 2011, p.3).

# Theoretical implications

According to the evidence extracted from marketing research that proposed the use of subliminal stimuli to influence an individual’s decision-making and subsequent behavior, the findings of this study provide empirical evidence and further advance current understanding of the use of emojis as positive feedback in CALL lessons. For maximum effectiveness of positive emojis, they need to be presented subliminally, thus supporting the findings of Balconi and Ferrari (2012), who assert that stimuli are evaluated by our brain based on their valence even though they are not consciously recognized. The influence of subliminal feedback of emojis would further lead to EFL learners’ effectiveness in English language learning. Contrariwise, when the feedback is given such that EFL learners can consciously see it, it may have a negative effect. Future research can use fMRI techniques, which have superior spatial accuracy in measuring the neural activities in the frontal lobe.

# Conclusion

This study extends the current body of knowledge on how subliminally and supraliminally presented emoji feedback in CALL affects EFL learners’ learning effectiveness as well as the motivational direction of the emotion of learning. To this extent, it is an attempt to understand EFL learners’ neural responses to emoji feedback in CALL courses. Furthermore, the focus is on how the presentation of emoji feedback is associated with the learning effectiveness of EFL learners. Three research hypotheses were proposed. EFL learners’ FAA and their recollection of the learning contents were measured as the index of their emotions and learning effectiveness in the CALL course, respectively. The results show that for EFL learners, positive feedback in the form of emojis generated positive/approach emotions when shown subliminally, but when shown supraliminally, the positive emotions were significantly low via social media to FtF, even lower than when no feedback was given at all. The study reported a significant relationship between EFL learners’ positive emotion and their learning effectiveness, thus confirming how positive emotions affect learning effectiveness in CALL lessons. Further research can identify the relationship between modes of emoji presentation and participants’ learning effectiveness. The hypothetical association whereby the mode of positive feedback in the form of emojis is significantly and strongly correlated with learning effectiveness was confirmed, as its correlation coefficient was found to be strong.
