# Genetic Testing

Advances in molecular genetics have led to the increasing availability of genetic testing for a variety of inherited disorders. While this new knowledge presents many obvious health benefits to prospective individuals and their families, it also raises complex ethical and moral dilemmas for families as well as genetic professionals.

This book explores the ways in which genetic testing generates not only probabilities of potential futures, but also enjoins new forms of social, individual and professional responsibility. Concerns about confidentiality and informed consent involving children, the assessment of competence and maturity, and the ability to engage in shared decision-making through acts of disclosure and choice are just some of the issues that are examined in detail.

Michael Arribas-Ayllon is Lecturer in Biological and Cognitive Psychology at Cardiff University. His research interests include histories and futures of biological knowledge, the social shaping of genetic testing, the politics of personalised medicine and the discourse ethics of genetic counselling and risk communication.

Srikant Sarangi is Professor of Language and Communication and Director of the Health Communication Research Centre at Cardiff University. His research interests are in discourse analysis and applied linguistics, language and identity in public life, and institutional/professional discourse studies. He is author/editor of 12 books, guest-editor of five journal special issues and has published over 200 journal articles and book chapters.

Angus Clarke is Professor in Clinical Genetics at Cardiff University. He has interests in Rett syndrome and ectodermal dysplasia, as well as genetic screening, the genetic counselling process and the social and ethical issues raised by advances in human genetics. He also teaches and works as a clinician. He represents the Chief Medical Officer for Wales on the Human Genetics Commission. He has co-authored and edited six books, including Genetics, Society and Clinical Practice (jointly with Professor Peter Harper).

Of particular significance is the funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) via Cesagen (the ESRC Research Centre for Economic and Social Aspects of Genomics) which translated into the Research Fellowship of Michael Arribas-Ayllon. We are very grateful to our colleagues in Cesagen for creating and sustaining a collegial and intellectually stimulating environment for this work to come to fruition.

We would also like to acknowledge the support of The Wellcome Trust and The Leverhulme Trust, both of which through various grants in the past have enabled the data collection from which the present book draws so substantially. Some of the interview data accessed in this book were collected by Susan Hogben under the auspices of Cesagen. We are especially grateful to all those – too many to name – who have provided constructive feedback at conferences and workshops and in other fora where we have presented our early analyses of data and preliminary findings.

Special thanks go to Helen Greenslade at Cesagen, and Kate Hill and Jennifer Dodd at Routledge for their timely and practical advice throughout the manuscript production.

This book draws on previous work by the authors. In particular, Chapter 5 is a revised and condensed version of two papers: ‘Managing self-responsibility through other-oriented blame: Family accounts of genetic testing’, which appeared in Social Science and Medicine 66(7): 1521–32, and ‘Micropolitics of responsibility vis-à-vis autonomy: Parental accounts of childhood genetic testing and (non)disclosure’, which appeared in Sociology of Health and Illness, 30(2): 255–71. Some material in Chapter 8 also appears in an earlier paper, ‘Professional Ambivalence: Accounts of Ethical Practice in Childhood Genetic Testing’, Journal of Genetic Counseling, 18(2): 173–84.

More than acknowledgement, we would like dedicate this book to our better halves – Kristrun, Usha and Jane – and our families for their unspoken patience and understanding ‘writ large’ when we returned home late on evenings after our ritual book meetings.

# 1 Introduction

Remember also, that if you go into the world you will have free will; that you will be obliged to have it; that there is no escaping it; that you will be fettered to it during your whole life, and must on every occasion do that which on the whole seems best to you at any given time, no matter whether you are right or wrong in choosing it (Samuel Butler 1872/1985: 171).

# A new ethical landscape

In 1974 an edited collection of papers appeared, bearing the curious title Genetic Responsibility: On Choosing Our Children’s Genes (Lipkin and Rowley 1974). It was the publication of a symposium on ‘Genetics, Man and Society’ held two years earlier at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC. Attended by medical, legal, ethical, psychiatric and genetic professionals, the symposium explored the implications of what were, at the time, major advances in genetic knowledge. The recent availability of prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis raised fresh concerns for both clients and professionals about whether to abort affected foetuses and whether to inform relatives about actual or potential risks. It was not that new genetic technologies ‘created’ these new and difficult choices, but that choice was necessitated by risks. Within the clinical setting, the complexity of decision making and the greater need for informed consent afforded new opportunities to establish the accepted principles of genetic counselling and to outline its ‘non-directive’ approach to information-giving (Hsia 1974). The notion of free will that the Butler quote above assumes as axiomatic, is inherently entangled with notions of risk and responsibility when decisions have to be made about self and others, especially in the wake of new technologies and their impact on social lives.

The term ‘genetic responsibility’, as it was used in 1974, seems to imply not a narrowing of responsibilities but the opening up of a new field of ethical conduct. This applies more generally to social and moral responsibility in other spheres of family life. However, the peculiar qualities of genetic knowledge formed new relations of identification with the bearer of genetic risks; it formed new relations with the unborn child who embodied such risks, but it also formed new relations with relatives who might also have to face similar complex decisions. That identity, reproduction and health could be framed in terms of ‘genetics’ and that ‘responsibility’ now assumed a genetic character meant that one’s biological future was now entangled in the calculation and management of one’s freedom. As the Butler quote above illustrates, free will is more than simply a liberal ‘right’, or an ontological ‘fact’; it also confers an obligation to manage oneself in terms of freedom. Rose and Novas (2005) have described this phenomenon of managing the present in light of biomedical knowledge of one’s future as ‘genetic prudence’: the activity of responsibly engaging in ethical calculation of future hazards through acts of choice, in this case, genetic choice. The appearance of genetic responsibility in the early 1970s marked an event in which new biological knowledge for the detection and calculation of ‘genetic risk’ were shaping the values, norms and expectations of individual identity as well as contemporary citizenship.

This book is about ‘genetic testing’ from the point of view of this new landscape of ethical conduct bounded by choices and responsibilities. It examines the ways in which the testing of inherited risk enjoins new forms of social, individual and professional responsibility, and by extension, provides new resources for blame. Families and professionals, entrepreneurs and consumers, and ‘the public’ more generally, are being drawn into discussions and decisions, which are changing the ways in which we think about ourselves and our relations with others, about future risks and how these can be minimised, if not avoided altogether. Concerns about confidentiality and informed consent involving children, the assessment of competence and maturity, the ability to engage in shared decision-making through acts of disclosure and choice, the difficulties of communicating risk to close and distant relatives, are just some of the issues faced by ‘at risk’ families in the clinic. More widely, the commercialisation of genetic information for the general public – for acting on inheritable genetic disorders and lifestyle risks – signals how genetic testing is broadening its circumference. The recent emergence of the personal genomics industry, the realities of direct-to-consumer marketing, and the testing for common complex disorders are raising new concerns about access to, and communication of, genetic knowledge.

In the book we address these issues by considering first the ‘technological trajectory’ of genetic testing and its implications for genetic counselling (Chapter 2). We then take a wider historical focus, contrasting classical-liberal and neo-liberal perspectives on heredity and genetics (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4, we outline our analytical framework, what we refer to as Rhetorical Discourse Analysis, which can be utilised for dealing with different kinds of data settings covered in the book. Building on the work that has examined representations and metaphors of genetics in the media, we explore the spectacle of genetic testing for common complex disorders on television and the internet (Chapter 5). The extent to which families engage in ‘genetic responsibility’ and use genetic knowledge as resources for displaying selfresponsibility as well as allocating blame to others is also considered in detail (Chapter 6). In the final two chapters, we examine the dynamics of negotiating and communicating genetic knowledge in the clinic (Chapter 7) and the formulation of professional dilemmas arising specifically in the prenatal genetics clinic (Chapter 8). The concluding chapter brings together the various threads and speculates future directions in terms of social research in genetic testing and its relevance for clinical practice. This book explores a range of data sites – representations of genetic testing on television and on the internet, research interviews with families and professionals, transcripts of clinical consultations and professional forums – to examine how new genetic technologies are discussed and negotiated in these domains.

# Genetic technologies and society

Genetic testing is a social practice as well as a technical, laboratory procedure. In fact, how we view the relationship between ‘technology’ and ‘society’ in general has important implications for how we think about genetic testing as a phenomenon. There is already a growing field of research that has examined the impact of genetic technology on biomedicine and society. Since the mid-1980s, rapid advances in genetic technology and the events preceding the Human Genome Project (roughly 1990–2002) have attracted the attention of sociologists, bioethicists, anthropologists, etc., many of whom were concerned with the construction of genetic knowledge, the promises of cure and prevention, and the public’s understanding of such knowledge. One area that received immediate scrutiny was the communication of risk in the context of genetic counselling (Lippman 1991, 1992b, Bosk 1992, Armstrong et al. 1998, Rapp 1999). Other commentators were concerned with what appeared to be the liberalisation of eugenics (Yoxen 1986, Duster 1990, King 1995, Kevles 1995, Kerr et al. 1997, Kerr 1998, Taussig et al. 2003), while others were interested in how the gene metaphor was shaping the imaginations of both science and the public (Nelkin and Lindee 1995, Rothman 1998, van Dijck 1998, Keller 2000).

A branch of sociology is dedicated to exploring the ways in which technologies are embedded in social networks. This is an important departure from the idea that technology is deterministic and acts ‘outside’ of society (MacKenzie and Wajcman 1985). Technological determinism or the technological imperative, in its extreme form, allows proponents to argue that advances in society are mainly attributed to advances in technology. Popular accounts of genetics, for instance, exemplify a deterministic view of new genetic technologies improving humanity by ‘revolutionising’ the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease (Petersen 2001). Such accounts tend to oversimplify the social effects of technology and treat the achievements of science as primary and global events. Rethinking the effects of technology requires a more dynamic and heterogeneous conception of society. The relationship between technology and society is neither unilateral nor unambiguously causal; they interact within a complex field of entities, within political and economic conditions, and through technological systems, networks, problems, etc. (Hughes 1983, Bijker et al. 1987).

# Genetic testing and social change

While it is generally acknowledged within the social sciences that the relationship between technology and society is complex, there are competing understandings about the extent to which science and technology is changing society. Our explicit empirical focus in this book seeks to make a contribution to such debates. One of our central arguments is that genetic testing not only produces knowledge that we are ‘fettered to’, as Butler puts it, but that new genetic knowledge is continuously negotiated and contested. The laboratory procedure of a ‘genetic test’ is only one dimension that has changed our knowledge of health and disease or our expectations of prevention and treatment. We argue that responsibility for the calculation and management of genetic risk is a situated activity accomplished by local actors. This has important implications for considering how, and to what extent, advances in new genetic technologies are transforming patterns of individuality, sociality and their interface.

Such concerns about the ‘impact’ of genetic testing have encouraged scholars working within the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine the contextual, mundane and negotiated aspects of ‘sociotechnical networks’ (Martin 1999, Hedgecoe 2004). In their review of the field, Hedgecoe and Martin (2008) identify two ‘broad styles of thinking’: what they call ‘transformational’ and ‘contextual’ accounts (2008: 819). Transformational accounts are typically ‘big stories’ that describe revolutionary changes in the structure of self and society. Contextual accounts are often ‘small stories’ grounded in empirical evidence that highlight local continuities and discontinuities in social practice. These two styles of thinking are not intended to be rigid dichotomies but flexible descriptions of the way in which the effects of genomic technologies are framed as revolutionary and global, on the one hand, and interactional and local, on the other. A position that exemplifies this transformational perspective is found in Novas and Rose (2000) who have persuasively argued that genetic technologies are creating new spaces of identification and ethical orientation, which they view more positively than the repressive implications of the ‘geneticisation thesis’ (Lippman 1991, 1992a). Kerr and colleagues (Kerr and Cunningham-Burley 2000, Kerr 2003) exemplify the kind of work that might be called contextual, highlighting historical continuities and local tensions which seem to call into question the revolutionary nature of genomics. Far from disappearing, reductionism and determinism continue to underpin modern techniques of genetic screening (see our discussion of genetic testing vs. genetic screening in Chapter 2), while ambivalence towards genetic risk seems to undermine the wholesale move towards the birth of ‘somatic individuality’ and ‘genetic responsibility’ (cf. Novas and Rose 2000).

Such tensions illustrate the need to maintain flexibility between contrasting perspectives on social and technological change – they remind us that social change is rarely homogenous and complete, but often uneven and partial. The approach we adopt in this book seeks a balance between transformational and contextual accounts of new genetic technologies. Our focus on discourse and rhetoric seeks to unravel and critically examine the complex interactions between technological and social systems, the continuous negotiation of problems and controversies, and the significance of contextual resources and constraints, all of which give technologies their particular form. Our approach offers a critique of technological determinism through immersion in the local, perspectival and contingent aspects in which artefacts, like genetic tests, are embedded within complex networks of interaction. From this perspective, we can see that work on the clinical application of genetic testing reveals a more restrained picture of radical, biomedically driven social change.

# Accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame

Why discuss genetic testing in terms of autonomy, responsibility and blame? At the start of our introduction we wanted to draw attention to how notions of responsibility and genetics have become conflated in ways that seem to suggest that the impact of new genetic technologies warrants new kinds of social deliberation and individual reflection. Terms such as ‘responsibility’ and ‘autonomy’ are the kinds of vocabularies experts use to identify ethical dilemmas, to anticipate future scenarios and to prescribe codes that might otherwise avert the uncomfortable consequences of screening populations, or testing at-risk individuals. In Chapter 3, we suggest that autonomy/responsibility can be treated as a relational pair that describes two sides of the same phenomenon: the double bind of freedom. Samuel Butler expressed this point with compelling familiarity over a century ago when he described a fictitious society in which the healthy were morally superior to the unhealthy and that ‘free will’ was both a right and an unavoidable obligation. Freedom is the condition of making choices for which we are accountable. And one of the claims that we want to explore in this book is that genetic technologies provide relatively new conditions within which these old concerns are recast.

Our interest in ‘accounts’ arises from the belief that the social order is always a moral order. For instance, Kant argued that moral action arises out of duty and respect for social norms embedded in the law:

It is of the greatest importance to attend with the utmost exactness in all moral judgements to the subjective principle of all maxims, that all morality of actions may be placed in the necessity of acting from duty and from respect for the law, not from love and inclination. (Kant 2008/1788: 57)

From a more contingent and contextual perspective, other scholars such as Garfinkel (1967) and Goffman (1971) have also treated the social order as a moral order. The morality of action is not simply the condition of being-in-the-world but also of being accountable to the world. ‘Accountability’, in this sense, refers to ordinary actions that constitute the social order by making its moral codes visible, explicable and sensible to others. Thus, when discussing accounts of autonomy and responsibility, we are more concerned with the relational and discursive dimensions of normativity. We want to understand the conditions under which it becomes necessary to provide accounts that defend, assert or problematise freedom and choice of action. And these issues are particularly relevant in the case of new genetic technologies and their application for calculating ‘genetic risk’ via screening and testing. The individual and relational nature of ‘genetic risk’ is such that people are simultaneously accountable to their own embodied concerns as well as the embodied concerns of others – close or distant relatives, actual or potential offspring, members of groups to whom they express some affiliation or social bond. The chain of accountability also extends to professionals, who are themselves accountable to clients, the institutions within which they work and their professional organisations. In the context of genetic testing, individuals are more or less impelled to decide whether or not to screen an unborn child, whether to terminate if the risks are evident, whether and when they intend to inform their relatives of familial risks. The moral, technical and cascading implications of genetic risk have become embedded within political and institutional rationalities, characterised by vocabularies and practices of accountability.

Concerns about the management of accountability are evident in the way that professional communities have responded to the ethical and legal challenges emerging from new genetic technologies. Accountability has become enshrined within the principles and codes of genetic professionals. For instance, the professionalisation of genetic counselling in the 1970s embraced notions of ‘genetic responsibility’ in order to distance genetic counsellors from the old eugenic ideologies by foregrounding an ethos of non-directiveness to uphold patient autonomy. The management of genetic risk would become a shared affair, the process and product of good communication between professionals and clients (Kenen 1984). This awareness has created new spaces of moral negotiation: ‘good’ counselling relied on the construction of persuasive accounts, the ability to deflect unreasonable requests, the tactics of eliciting ethical decision-making through strategic and rhetorical interaction (Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2009).

If managing genetic risk is both a moral and a situated activity, then it follows that risk management is also linked to systems of blame. Extending on her earlier work on danger and taboo, Douglas (1992) argues that our modern preoccupation with risk is symptomatic of a moral-political system that explains misfortune by assigning responsibility to others through blame:

The theme, well known to anthropologists, is that in all places at all times the universe is moralized and politicized. Disasters that befoul the air and soil and poison the water are generally turned to political account: someone already unpopular is going to be blamed for it. (Douglas 1992: 5)

Blaming systems are symptoms of the way a society is organised; they are moral explanations of events that fulfil political purposes. In neo-liberal societies, characterised by decentralised and devolved government, systems of blame are reorganised in ways that now distribute responsibility to all ‘active’ citizens. Galvin (2002) vividly describes this phenomenon in which personal responsibility for health is inexorably linked to blame:

The healthy person is, in effect, symbolic of the ideal neoliberal citizen, autonomous, active and responsible and the person who deviates from this ideal state is, at best, lacking in value and, at worst, morally culpable. (Galvin 2002: 117)

But in the context of new genetic technologies, even the healthy person can be assigned a ‘presymptomatic’ risk status, which confers a responsibility to manage one’s health and affairs wisely.

New genetic technologies are also linked to blame in much more subtle and normative ways, especially when genetic screening services become routinised in reproductive medicine or in wider public health programmes. For instance, Duster (1990) observes that the availability of genetic screening services is enough to create their own demand. The subtle pressure to use these services is linked to systems of blame because once the technology is available and a woman chooses not to have screening then the birth of a child with a disability is no longer an act of fate but of personal irresponsibility.

Issues of blame and responsibility also arise from the consequences of what one does with genetic risk information. Within the family, disclosure of genetic information is often linked to blame, which can flow in different generational directions (Featherstone et al. 2006). Siblings, cousins and parents are blamed when the responsibility to disclose risk information does not result in reciprocated understandings or when disclosure has no impact on reproductive responsibilities (Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2008a). As we will see, the genetic basis of risk provides individuals and families as well as experts with new resources for assigning responsibility and blame. In the accounts that we explore in this book, we treat autonomy, responsibility and blame as formulations that seek to either problematise or restore a socio-moral order that has become fully enmeshed with concerns over the management of risk (Beck 1992, 2009).

# Our approach

We adopt a discursive approach which, in the broadest sense, means that genetic knowledge, such as ‘risk genes’ or ‘genetic testing’, emerges as historically variable devices for conceptualising actual and potential pathologies. This version of discourse lends itself to understanding how technical innovations in biomedicine engender corresponding transformations within systems of thought and action. However, as mentioned earlier, to give balance to such transformational views of genetic knowledge, it is necessary to consider the contextual and interactional aspects in which these technologies are locally embedded.

For the purposes of this book, we employ a less abstract and more situated definition of discourse, one that seeks to understand how categories of ‘risk’ and ‘genetic testing’ are actually problematised and negotiated in different domains. The rhetorical discourse analytic approach (elaborated in Chapter 4) draws on several traditions from sociology, social psychology and sociolinguistics. It combines the action and epistemological orientation of discourse in order to highlight that language does things, brings about effects, and constructs knowledge via modes of representation and interaction. We believe that the rhetorical aspects of discourse are essential to understanding language use and other modes of communication, which is not simply propositional or informational, but argumentative and persuasive.

Furthermore, the rhetorical nature of accounts is central to understanding how genetic knowledge is embedded in the problem of social order. This is an ‘ethical’ problem insofar as genetic technologies enjoin new relations of self-identification and self-management (i.e. the relation of the self to the self), but it is also a ‘moral’ problem insofar as genetic knowledge enjoins new relations of obligation and commitment (i.e. the relation of the self to others). By focusing on the rhetorical organisation of social action, we highlight the kind of tensions that arise in concrete situations. These are practical dilemmas faced by professionals and individuals in the making of choices and decisions over health and wellbeing, over life and death; these are practical difficulties in the communication of risk when the ‘transmission’ of genetic responsibility is suffused by stigma, ambivalence and dread; these are practical concerns over the competence of minors and the understandings of adults for whom these risks apply. In contrast to normative and principle-based ethics, we offer a method of investigating these issues that goes beyond mere justifications of codes and principles as far as professional practice is concerned. Drawing from empirical examples (see Chapter 8), we propose a kind of ‘situated communication ethics’ that shows that ethical and moral dilemmas reside not so much in knowing what code to implement when but in how to accomplish the management of genetic risk through interaction.

# The data corpus

Clearly, genetic testing is a phenomenon that has ethical, moral, legal, medical, economic and personal dimensions, the nature of which is broadly conceived as ‘social’. To capture this multidimensionality, we collected data from different domains – public, private and institutional – to provide a rich and well-rounded discussion. The data used in this book consist of five types: research interviews, clinical encounters, professional discussion groups, web-based text, and televised (reality-based) documentary. As a body of data, the corpus has been selected to reflect the relevant domains, the people working or acting within these domains, as representative of the practice of genetic testing. We have also selected forms of mediated text in which new genetic technologies are represented to the wider public as forms of knowledge and promise. And finally, the corpus has been designed with the purpose of capturing the tensions and contradictions arising from different actors as requests for, and interpretations of, genetic knowledge are negotiated in different domains.

The data corpus is the aggregation of several projects conducted between 1998 and 2007. Each project was subject to the approval of Local and Medical Research Ethics Committees. Prior to their taking part in these projects, informed consent was obtained from professionals, clients, patients and family members. All identifying information has been removed or altered to preserve anonymity. In some cases, information about genetic disorders has been suppressed or described generically to avoid identification of particular families.

With the exception of media representations, the data presented in Chapters 6, 7 and 8 represent talk between an interviewer and family members (Chapter 6), between an interviewer and a professional (Chapter 8), naturalistic recordings of professional–client talk (Chapter 7) or a group of professionals discussing clinical cases (Chapter 8). These events were audio-recorded and transcribed anonymously using a broad set of transcription conventions (see Appendix). Mediated texts, designed for public consumption, were selected in relation to a reality-based documentary televised in the UK, which provides an ideal opportunity to treat public mediation of genetic testing as a unique case study. In each of the relevant chapters we provide more detailed information about recruitment and sampling.

# Synopses of individual chapters

In Chapter 2, we give a technical account of genetic testing. We explain what counts as a genetic test and outline the development of diagnostic tests over the past 40 years. We discuss some of the different clinical contexts of genetic testing and introduce the recent genome-based approaches to research that are beginning to be applied both in the clinical setting and commercially. In the future, problems arising from ‘public health genetics’ – especially the health economic implications of genetic testing – may present difficult decisions both at the level of health service planning and also in relation to the individual patient. Future challenges are also likely to come from the generation of large quantities of genome sequence data on individuals; such sequence data will continue to have unclear or ambiguous implications for the prevention or treatment of ‘common complex’ disorders for many years to come.

In Chapter 3, we examine discourses of autonomy, responsibility and blame by exploring some historical and conceptual links between liberalism and genetics. We identify particular discourses that have significantly changed healthcare settings by not only restructuring how modern healthcare is provided but also redefining the rights and capacities of individuals as rational consumers of health. A comparison between neo-liberalism and eugenics helps to illustrate the ways in which biological knowledge has been used in the past to morally reform the health and welfare of society. This historical account provides an important context within which the language of the ‘new genetics’ can be reassessed. The increasing enrolment of client autonomy and consumer choice is symptomatic of how the logics of the market and an ethic of self-governance have replaced the desire to improve society through state coercion. Genetic counselling, for instance, not only safeguards against eugenic abuses, but seeks to promote a form of citizenship in which autonomy and responsibility are the interactive goals of genetic counselling (see Chapter 7).

In Chapter 4, we explain the methodological framework that informs our data analysis. We propose the framework of Rhetorical Discourse Analysis to understand how autonomy, responsibility and blame emerge as key themes in research interviews, in transcripts of clinical encounters and in the framing of genetic knowledge in the public domain. Rhetorical Discourse Analysis is premised upon social actions as accounts. The social accountability of language, discourse, rhetoric, text and the like are treated as descriptions that do things and construct particular versions of reality. However, not all the data we consider in this book are limited to social interaction. We also show that accounts can appear on websites, in documentaries or advertisements, through the mixing of different discourse practices. One of the aims of this book is to show how discourses of genetics are mutating at the level of intertexuality (Chapter 5).

In Chapter 5, we focus on the ways in which genetic testing is commercialised and promoted in the public domain. Many studies have examined how genetic knowledge is portrayed in the media, but few studies have examined in detail the domain of the ‘new media’ in which new genres of communication and promotion are taking shape around promises of empowerment and personalised risk management. Taking examples from the internet and from television, we examine the complex array of discourse devices used to promote genetic susceptibility testing in the newly emerging ‘personal genomics’ market. The bulk of this chapter will focus on how the UK personal genomics company, GeneticHealth, promote their services on the internet and on television.

In Chapter 6, we consolidate our previous work on family communication of genetic risk in relation to themes of parental responsibility, the child’s autonomy and familial blame. We examine family interview data to show how parents seek to balance parental responsibility with the child’s autonomy without at the same time appearing to exercise their own autonomy or concerns. Rhetorical analysis reveals the kinds of discourse devices parents frequently use in order to convey a picture of open, dialogic communication in the family. In the second part, we explore the ways in which family members seek to display and perform responsible selfhood through blaming other family members. Genetic information throws into relief a complex and discontinuous context of family relations which are implicated in accounts of (non-)disclosure or of (not) testing family members. They show that the domain of genetic responsibility is considerably more nuanced than normative accounts of open, dialogic communication. Participants use a variety of rhetorical strategies to blame others in ways that exonerate themselves from blame. Furthermore, who is blamed for what not only reflects tensions within the family but also different views of genetic knowledge and different generational life histories.

In Chapters 7 and 8, we move to the practice of genetics in the clinical setting to explore various case studies surrounding genetic testing. In Chapter 7, we outline the activity of genetic counselling, explaining its ethos, structure and process, and draw on a few case studies involving predictive testing of both children and adults across a range of conditions. The main focus is to explore complex topics that arise in relation to decisions to test or not to test and to disclose or not to disclose test results. We draw particular attention to the discourse strategies and resources used in the clinic, particularly those which assume rhetorical significance by orienting to issues of autonomy, responsibility and blame.

In Chapter 8, we focus on the kind of ethical dilemmas that arise in the prenatal genetics clinic. In particular, we consider five ‘difficult’ or ‘challenging’ cases brought up for discussion by professionals in interviews or in a practitioner forum; this material, to varying degrees, establishes certain limits of (non-)directiveness in genetic counselling and the professionally acceptable influence of third parties on client decision-making. In many respects, ethical dilemmas are justificatory accounts of professional responsibility that foreground the role of genetic counsellors as advocates and defenders of client autonomy.

It is difficult to offer firm conclusions or make predictions in a field that is changing so rapidly as human genetics. However, as we move towards an era of increased computing, genome-sequencing and data mining, our understanding of genetics and genomics will be limited only by the increasing deluge of information. There is good reason to believe that rather than producing simpler and more precise understandings of health and disease we must endure a period of increasing complexity and uncertainty (Check Hayden 2010). This suggests that interpretative flexibility of genetic information is very likely to increase for certain kinds of testing in the near future. This is especially true as companies offering genome-based testing for ‘susceptibility’ promote their services as vaguely diagnostic and unambiguously informative. The commercial promotion of genome-based testing taps into powerful fantasies and expectations about disease prevention and personal control, that routinely delete scientific complexity and uncertainty and present the genome as a ‘static’ resource fit for commercial exploitation. This is not to say that genome-based approaches cannot be used for research into the underlying pathogenesis of many common complex conditions. But on this front, the science of molecular biology has arrived at ‘the beginning of the end’.

What remains an issue for us, and a strong focus in this book, is the way that genetic knowledge is mediated and negotiated through a range of complex issues that can be expressed as concerns of autonomy, responsibility and blame. After all, these are concepts that describe this contemporary liberal game of ‘less government’ and ‘fettered freedom’ wherein individuals, families and professionals are to establish among themselves the proper uses of genetic information. In the context of the family and the clinic and in the domain of the new media, our central focus is to show the situated discourse strategies and resources actors use to establish these limits that require ongoing interpretation, ethical deliberation and forethought about the consequences of biomedical knowledge. In this way, by foregrounding a range of cases and problems that arise in different situations, we aim to show the resourcefulness of the various actors and to reveal the ways in which genetic knowledge is embedded within the socio-moral order of contemporary lives.

# 2 Genetic testing: technology in context

# Introduction

Advances in human genetics have transformed our understanding of many inherited conditions. These advances have led to major developments in diagnostic methods, improved classification of diseases and the introduction of some new, rational therapies. Some enthusiastic researchers and commentators have made excessive claims about the pace at which developments in genomic science will lead to changes in routine clinical practice. Other voices, especially those of clinicians and activist groups, have adopted a more cautious and sceptical tone. In this chapter we seek to give a modest account of genetic testing based on what has become possible over the last few decades and what may become feasible over the next 5–10 years.

In such a contested and sometimes confusing area, it is necessary for us to use key words in a clear and precise fashion. By ‘genetic testing’, we do not mean simply the application of a laboratory process to a biological sample; this would imply that genetic testing is simply the application of an artefact independent of its ‘interpretative flexibility’ (Pinch and Bijker 1984). In this book we use the phrase ‘genetic testing’ to encompass not only the application of an ‘assay’ (Zimmern and Kroese 2007) – a laboratory technique of analysing, detecting and quantifying a DNA sample – but also the interpretation of the laboratory findings within the clinical context, i.e., via genetic counselling. In this respect, ‘genetic testing’, in the way it is promoted via websites and television documentaries, falls short of our conceptualisation (see Chapter 5). This is in part a value judgement, an ideological commitment to the importance of delivering genetic counselling. It is not that genetic counselling is necessarily required before any laboratory-based genetic investigation is performed; rather, it is essential that those providing a test (including those made available via the internet) offer a unified package of the scientific investigation accompanied by sound interpretation and professional judgement. In the current climate of rational-economic efficiency and direct-to-consumer marketing, there is a danger that genetic testing will be reduced to a mere laboratory result. Attempts to develop a market for genetic tests of susceptibility to common diseases such as diabetes, cancer, coronary artery disease, hypertension and dementia are likely to gloss over the limited clinical applicability or benefits of such testing and to downplay the appropriate role for genetic counselling.

# Testing includes counselling

Where genetic counselling is required, it would be damaging for services to provide the laboratory test in isolation. This can occur all too easily if funding through an insurance scheme provides resources for only part of the package. Indeed, this has been a problem in some European countries and is especially likely to arise where the provision of genetic investigations is privately funded.1 By including discussion about genetic testing in an integrated package of genetic testing as ‘genetic counselling and laboratory analysis’, we can recognise two categories of decision: (i) the general policy decision about whether or not a particular genetic investigation should be made available as a diagnostic service for those perhaps affected by, or at risk of, the corresponding genetic disease; and (ii) the decision about testing or not testing for the individual case, made by the patient or client in conjunction with their health professionals and perhaps also with other members of their family. In this book, we do not address questions of the first category – the broader policy issues of the conditions under which genetic technologies are made available – instead this chapter will focus on the dimension of genetic counselling-plus-testing.

# Development of genetic testing procedures

We must now outline the different types of genetic testing that will be discussed throughout the rest of the book. We need to understand at least something of the technical possibilities before considering family perspectives vis-à-vis clinical practice in more detail.

One potential ambiguity or confusion about the scope of genetic testing relates to the nature of the laboratory process. If a test employs chromosomal or DNA-related technologies, does that make it a genetic test? Or, is a ‘genetic’ test one that gives results relevant to a genetic condition? DNA technology is now often used to seek evidence of bacterial or viral infection, looking for bacterial or viral DNA sequences, but we are not going to include such gene-based investigations of other organisms within the scope of ‘genetic testing’ in this volume.

The converse situation is actually generating information about a genetic condition through other types of investigation – does a person have a genetic condition or not? For example, an abdominal ultrasound scan may indicate that a person has polycystic kidney disease (PKD) whether or not it has yet caused them any symptoms, so it could generate predictive genetic information. The muscle biopsy from a young boy may be studied in the neuropathology laboratory, using antibodies against specific parts of the dystrophin protein, and a diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) may be made without direct use of DNA technology (although these distinctions are not simple: generation of the antibodies will have involved DNA technology). In this book, when we refer to genetic testing, the laboratory component of the test will usually employ DNAbased methods. If we wish to refer to non-genetic methods that generate genetic information, then we will make that explicit. In short, the default meaning of ‘genetic test’ in this book is the package of genetic counselling along with chromosome- or DNA-based laboratory investigation carried out in relation to a human genetic disorder. In the interest of space, we skip a technical description of basic molecular genetics and instead focus on the historical development of genetic technologies; however, the reader may find a brief description of ‘genes and chromosomes’ useful (see Box 2.1).

# Box 2.1 Genes and chromosomes

Genes can be defined in other ways but, for our purposes, each gene consists of a length of DNA – a short part of the length of a chromosome that is required for a particular biological function – typically specifying the sequence of amino acids along the length of a protein molecule. Genes are too small to be visible under the light microscope but they are arranged along the length of the chromosomes, structures that each consist of two intertwined DNA molecules. These constitute the double helix and are closely associated with a mass of proteins and RNA. Chromosomes become visible microscopically when they become dense and tightly compacted at the time of cell division. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in each human cell, except for the egg and the sperm that contain just one of each type of chromosome. The chromosomes carry almost all the genetic information required for an individual to develop as an embryo, to grow as a child and to function as an adult.

There is a small additional amount of genetic information carried in the mitochondria, structures within each cell that perform multiple, complex biochemical reactions especially (but not only) relating to the production and utilisation of energy. The mitochondria are of evolutionary interest, having a bacterial origin as independent organisms that cooperated with early singlecelled organisms and became incorporated into them. Tests of mitochondrial DNA variation are sometimes required as mitochondrial DNA mutations can cause a number of inherited disorders. Such mitochondrial inheritance of disease can generate difficulties of comprehension and communication within families because the transmission of mitochondria is through the maternal lineage only, but we will say no more about that here.

Leaving aside the mitochondria that we inherit in the oöcyte (egg cell), we all inherit two copies of each of our genes and chromosomes. One set of genes comes from each parent in the egg and the sperm. There are some 20,000 or so different types of genes in the human, laid out end to end along the length of the 24 different types of chromosome; there are 22 pairs of chromosomes that are the same in men and women (the autosomes) and then the pair of sex chromosomes, either XX or XY. Chromosome 1 is much the largest chromosome; the other autosomes are numbered by size down to the smallest – numbers 21 and 22.

# Recent historical trajectory of human genetics

Broadly speaking, human genetics is the study of inheritance in human beings. It has developed rapidly to become a field with many different specialist areas and applications. Before we introduce the different clinical contexts of genetic testing, or anticipate what is technologically feasible, it would be helpful to outline the major stages of technical development over the past 30 or so years. Our purpose is not to reduce human genetics to ‘technical advances’ or to promote a simplistic view of clinical developments as being technology-led. Rather, we aim to give a sense of how the rate and scale of production of genetic information creates new domains of interpretative flexibility.

Initially, laboratory genetic investigations were applied to patients seen by specialists in clinical genetics; these fell into two major groups: (i) children with malformations or problems of physical and cognitive development,2 and (ii) patients, or at-risk relatives, in families affected by Mendelian genetic disorders.3 When patients in the first group have been referred for a diagnosis, genetic testing has until recently focused largely on their chromosomes. Families in the second group are referred to discuss ‘risk’ and the possibility of predictive testing or the potential use of genetic testing to support decisions about reproduction; genetic testing for these conditions usually employs molecular (DNA-based) methods.

In the 1970s, two major types of investigation into genetic disorders were introduced into regular clinical practice: chromosome analysis (cytogenetic testing) and the Guthrie test. Cytogenetic testing involved counting chromosomes to detect differences in chromosome number in the autosomes (e.g. an additional chromosome in Down syndrome) or in the sex chromosomes (e.g. the sex chromosome aneuploidies [SCAs], especially Turner syndrome [45 XO], Klinefelter syndrome [XXY] and the XYY syndrome). After methods of staining chromosomes were developed it became possible to distinguish chromosome bands and to recognise when specific chromosome segments were deleted, duplicated or rearranged. These methods have had a major impact on the understanding of spontaneous reproductive loss and of developmental disabilities.

The Guthrie test was performed on a heelprick bloodspot taken from an infant in the first week of life. This was the first method to make feasible newborn screening for the early identification of infants affected by phenylketonuria (PKU), a relatively common ‘inborn error of metabolism’ in Western Europe and some other populations. The initial laboratory method entailed a bacterial growth assay but the name of that test has been applied to the whole process and persisted even when the assay method changed. Because of the greatly improved outlook for infants with PKU who were diagnosed early, newborn screening for metabolic disorders soon acquired an ‘acceptable face’, although the benefits of early diagnosis are not so clear for many of the long list of conditions that are becoming readily identifiable with modern biochemical techniques such as tandem mass spectrometry (TMS).

In the next decade, the 1980s, linkage studies were used to track short fragments of DNA from each chromosome (known as DNA probes) through extended families affected by Mendelian disorders. When a disease gene and a DNA probe were regularly co-inherited, it could be inferred that the two were located close together on the same chromosome. This allowed genetic testing to be developed for Mendelian diseases; it also led to the gradual accumulation of information about the genes and other DNA sequences present on each chromosome and their linear order along the chromosomes. Such studies enabled the localisation and later the isolation of several genes in which mutations cause some of the major inherited disorders, e.g., cystic fibrosis (CF) and Huntington’s disease (HD). ‘Islands’ or clusters of physically close gene probes and their corresponding disease loci were found scattered around the genome. These islands of linked genes were gradually pieced together as more markers were found, so that an outline of a ‘genetic map’ for each chromosome emerged. For a few diseases with easily detected mutations, such as the large deletions often associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the recognition of mutations led quickly to improved accuracy in diagnostic testing.

Methods of mapping genes improved from around 1990 with two major developments: (i) advanced and more stable vectors capable of carrying greater lengths of human DNA, such as Bacterial Artifical Chromosomes (BACs); and (ii) the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the rapid and highly accurate amplification of specific, short fragments of DNA. These two advances led to a huge increase in the pace of linkage analyses and DNA sequencing. For those genes already mapped and isolated, as with CF, accurate mutation detection became more readily available. The Human Genome Project (HGP), which commenced in 1990, drew upon these developments while simultaneously contributing to them. Although not all of those involved in gene mapping projects at the time saw the future practical benefits of the HGP, its systematic approach to establishing physical maps of each chromosome and the industrial-scale sequencing of chromosome segments was a major advance in efficiency. The pace of disease gene mapping accelerated as a result of these practical benefits.

In the decade commencing in 2000, a virtually complete sequence of the human genome became available, and a more comprehensive understanding of Mendelian disorders has emerged as the molecular mechanisms of disease have become better appreciated. Beginning in 2010, we are now witnessing the next phase of genomic research, the charting of human DNA sequence variation. This aims to detect all population variants at the level of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Copy Number Variants (CNVs), and permits direct comparison of the genome sequence of many individuals as well as comparisons between populations (informing studies of early human evolution and migration) and between species (informing our understanding of primate evolution). The international collaboration, ‘The 1000 Genomes Project’, has already greatly exceeded that number of individuals whose genomes have been sequenced. The rate and scale at which genetic information is being produced has created even greater challenges for interpretation. The avalanche of accumulating data presents new statistical challenges of translating massive datasets into improved understanding of disease and into practical benefits for patients and families.

# The move to common complex disorders

The techniques developed for the HGP have led to technological platforms, such as microarrays and ‘Gene Chips’, for conducting genome-wide, SNP-based studies. The targeting of ‘polymorphisms’ (variant forms present in a population) has paved the way for population-based studies which have sufficient power to detect risk alleles of small to moderate effect. Many ‘common complex disorders’ are thought to arise through the combined action of multiple genes of small to moderate effect sizes as well as gene-environment interactions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified associations between common population genetic variants and some of the common complex disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1D, juvenile, insulin-dependent diabetes) and type 2 (T2D, maturity-onset diabetes), hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid disease, dementia, schizophrenia, bowel cancer and breast cancer.

The findings of such GWAS-based research are beginning to be applied in two ways: (i) to recognise the genetic variation that contributes to disease processes; and (ii) to estimate an individual’s risk of developing complex diseases (see Chapter 5). The benefits of the first category of application are becoming apparent with the discovery of new pathogenetic mechanisms and there are grounds to hope that this will lead to the development of new, rational therapies. The benefits of the second type of ‘application’ are not yet apparent as the data have often been derived from restricted populations and the application of research results to the testing of healthy individuals may have little clinical validity or utility (Hunter et al. 2008, Janssens et al. 2008, Jakobsdottir et al. 2009, Edelman and $\mathrm { E n g ~ 2 0 0 9 }$ , Ned and Goldstein 2009). The proportion of the genetic contribution to risk of disease that can be accounted for through such GWAS is small, often no more than $1 0 \%$ .

The development of microarray technologies has also enabled diagnostic laboratories to use these methods to detect variation in the number of copies of DNA sequences around the genome, while striving to close the diagnostic gap between cytogenetic and molecular technologies. It has become apparent that CNVs, for instance, are much more common than can be demonstrated by conventional cytogenetic technology. Such rearrangements are proving to be important causes of disorders of physical and cognitive development, such as autism and schizophrenia (Walsh et al. 2008). There may also be a contribution of CNVs to some other common complex disorders but the extent of this remains to be clarified (Estivill and Armengol 2007). This field is developing so rapidly that it is difficult to predict what will emerge in even the next few years.

Microarray techniques are also being applied in research laboratories to examine genome-wide (‘global’) patterns of gene expression in different tissues at different stages of development and disease. The same technologies are being used to investigate human cancers and haematological malignancies, looking for changes in gene expression or gene copy number that may give clues to pathogenesis and possible therapeutic opportunities. For some sub-categories of malignancy, such as specific leukaemias, breast cancers and colorectal tumours, therapeutic guidance based on the genetic testing of individual tumours is indeed becoming a reality.

It is clear that there is a large reservoir of variation throughout the genome, most of which is not directly involved in causing genetic disease but is simply the result of random divergence between population groups. These regions of genomic variation have been used to track genes involved in the individually uncommon (but collectively important) Mendelian disorders. The polymorphisms (SNPs and CNVs) now detectable with genomic technologies have been used in major studies of the common complex disorders and several commercial enterprises now offer genetic testing for susceptibility to these diseases on the basis of (mostly weak) associations between a large panel of SNPs and a range of diseases. Companies marketing GWAS-based tests rely on clients’ limited understandings of such tests and what they are (in)capable of showing (Kaye 2008, Patch et al. 2009, Lachance et al. 2010, Wright and Kroese 2010). Scientists engaged in such research have contributed to discussions about how the quality of ‘personalised medicine’ may be improved. They suggest that the move to genome sequencing will be necessary, but emphasise that the interpretation of sequence data will be a major challenge (Ng et al. 2009a). If potential clients were adequately informed about the science, if they received impartial genetic counselling, or if personal genomics companies acknowledged the incompleteness of susceptibility testing, then it is doubtful whether such companies would find it worthwhile to enter the market. We will return to this topic in Chapter 5 where we examine how genetic susceptibility testing is marketed in the mass media (i.e. via the internet and television).

The hope of these SNP-based GWAS analyses has essentially harkened back to the polygenic models of disease from the 1920s and 1930s, in which Fisher (1918) and Wright (1932) showed mathematically that common diseases could in principle arise from the additive effects of a large number of the common and individually small, but cumulatively substantial, risk-related variants. There are numerous problems with the application of such models to humans, however, including the limitations on our ability to assess the effects of gene-gene $( \mathrm { G x G } )$ and geneenvironment (GxE) interactions (Moore and Williams 2009, Emily et al. 2009); the inflation of the estimated heritability of many such diseases through the strategies of measurement employed; the failure to acknowledge the possible contribution of new or recent (and therefore usually rare) mutations in contributing to some of these disorders (Dickson et al. 2010, Clarke and Cooper 2010); and the failure so far to adjust for epigenetic effects, through which the intrauterine (prenatal) and early postnatal environment can influence the incidence of later disease. One attempted solution is to pool data in larger studies of individuals from different populations but this introduces its own fresh problems of interpretation. Thus the associations between SNPs and disease predisposition as well as the $\mathrm { G x G }$ and $\mathrm { G x E }$ interactions may differ substantially between populations, especially those that have diverged in the remote past or that have experienced very different demographic histories and patterns of migration (Jobling et al. 2004), so that the search for ‘replication of results’ in different population groups may be misguided.

# Next generation sequencing technologies

The SNP-based, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded a mass of data indicating weak associations between specific variants dispersed around the genome (the SNPs) and the occurrence of disease. These associations are often reported in statements of relative risk (RR); the RR of one allele compared to the population risk of disease might typically lie between 0.7 or 0.8 (the disease is slightly less likely) and 1.2 or 1.3 (the disease is slightly more likely). Such figures are not especially helpful clinically – they could hardly allow a physician to make a diagnosis, let alone a firm prediction, and the basis of the association usually remains obscure in that a particular SNP may not be the causal factor underlying the association. Instead, the SNP may be associated with other variants nearby on the chromosome, one or more of which may play ‘the causal role’. Or the association may have arisen by chance in the pool of individuals studied and will disappear when larger samples – additional research participants or people from different populations – are recruited.

The value of GWAS research results is that they may point to areas of the genome in which genetic variation does play a biological role in explaining an individual’s susceptibility to disease; this may lead to further avenues of research. The direct application of GWAS results to clinical practice, however, is fraught with problems for the reasons outlined above. The application of test results to individuals has limited explanatory or predictive power. While individuals may benefit from genetic counselling to explain the limitations of probabilistic risk estimates, the information cannot be considered independently of medical and family history or other kinds of informative biomarkers (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.).

In contrast to the indirect hints about the genetic factors relevant to health and disease obtained from SNP testing, full sequence information of patients may be of much greater value. To the extent that genetic information is of importance for understanding, treating or preventing disease, that information will be present in each individual’s genome sequence (see Conclusion). While the interpretation of such sequence information from individuals is clearly a major challenge, we can be confident that the quality of interpretation is likely to improve steadily over the next few decades. This will not be a quick or easy task but will require a sustained programme of investment and, even then, our ability to interpret genome sequence data may remain limited by constraints on the information available about individuals’ health and their environment and constraints on generating the data required to understand gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.

Despite these difficulties, the interpretation of sequence data has commenced in earnest and can already inspire future efforts to build on the first steps. The X chromosome ‘exome’ – the coding regions of all the transcribed, protein-coding genes on the X chromosome – were sequenced in $> ~ 2 0 0$ families as part of a research study of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) (Tarpey et al. 2009). This identified a number of genes contributing to XLMR but, in the process, demonstrated that a loss of function in $1 \%$ or more of genes on the X chromosome is fully compatible with good health and normal development in males (who have only a single copy of each X chromosome gene). This gives us insight into the much greater magnitude of the task of interpreting sequence data on the other chromosomes (where two copies of each gene will be present in each individual), so that the consequences of mutation in their protein-coding sequences are likely to be more subtle.

The full exome sequencing of all chromosomes was reported on 12 individuals later the same year $\mathrm { N g }$ et al. 2009b). This study demonstrated numerous nonsense mutations (that disrupt gene function), many of which were common and not apparently associated with any phenotype; it also identified the gene in which mutations cause a rare autosomal dominant disorder. The technology required to produce full sequence information, not merely the exome, has been under development and the cost has fallen so that it is becoming available as a research tool (Pushkarev et al. 2009, for example). Such methods are already beginning to generate clinically applicable results (Ashley et al. 2010) which make it apparent that the generation of the sequence is but the first of many challenges to making effective use of the information. Not the least of these fresh challenges will be the need to introduce safeguards for the privacy and welfare of the individual citizen while still permitting research to flourish and clinical practice to incorporate the new approaches (Kaye et al. 2010).

# The clinical context of types of genetic testing

So far, we have talked about types of genetic procedures in the laboratory context, but genetics professionals and clients seeking genetic counselling deal with different types of genetic testing in the clinic setting. We will now focus on the clinical contexts in which ‘genetic testing plus counselling’ is offered for a range of different clinical purposes and for different genetic disorders. We start by considering how the testing of biological patterns of inheritance, such as dominant and recessive disorders, impact on the family in complex ways.

# Testing for dominant and recessive genetic mutations

There are important biological differences between dominant and recessive disorders. For example, mutations that disrupt the action of an enzyme are most often recessive, because an organism will often function adequately with only $5 0 \%$ of the normal activity level of many enzymes. Conversely, mutations in the genes encoding structural proteins can often result in a dominant disorder, as with fibrillin gene mutations in Marfan syndrome and collagen gene mutations in osteogenesis imperfecta.4

There are also important social differences between dominant and recessive disorders. In a family affected by a dominant genetic disorder, where each affected person has one intact copy of the relevant gene and one altered copy, there will be a $5 0 \%$ (1 in 2) chance of transmitting the disease to each child. Parents have to make decisions about whether to have a child who might be affected in the same way as one of them. Further, if they have an affected or at-risk child, they will need to consider how to talk about this inheritance with the child. In a family affected by an autosomal recessive disorder, where a couple who are both unaffected carriers of the condition have a $2 5 \%$ (1 in 4) chance of both handing on the altered gene allele to the same child, there are also difficulties of family communication but they may take a different form. The affected children are relatively unlikely to transmit the disorder to their children but there may be issues for the affected child’s parents: about whether or not to risk having another affected child and about how to disclose the condition to their own brothers and sisters, who may well be unaffected carriers of the condition. This may be especially difficult in the context of customary consanguinity and arranged marriages, as the risks of recurrence may then be greater and there is a risk of other family members becoming subject to a ‘courtesy stigma’ or ‘stigma by association’ and being unwelcome as prospective marital partners (Goffman 1968). In fact, a family history of disease may well be stigmatising in such contexts irrespective of the actual mode of inheritance or the risk of the disease in question. In Chapters 6, 7 and 8 we explore the ways in which family members and professionals discuss the obligation to transmit information about dominant or recessive disorders to other family members.

In late-onset disorders, an at-risk child may not become affected until well into adult life, depending upon the disease and the mutation. Even for those with positive (unfavourable) predictive test results, there is always an element of uncertainty about the exact onset and the severity of disease manifestation. Some individuals may be fortunate not to be affected by a mutation they carry and that causes severe problems in other members of their family. This may be a matter of chance in the case of mutations in some of the tumour suppressor genes, where a familial form of cancer is transmitted as a dominant trait through a family. Each ‘affected’ individual inherits one intact and one mutated copy of the gene, but some individuals escape without problems because a tumour will only arise when their other copy of the gene has been inactivated by a fresh ‘second-hit’ mutation in a cell in the relevant tissue. Some individuals may then escape if no second-hit mutation occurs in the intact allele.

In some dominant disorders, there is only a very restricted range of mutations found to be responsible, which is clearly the case with the triplet repeat expansion diseases, e.g., Huntington’s Disease (HD). In these conditions, it is technically simple to test any at-risk family member as long as the original diagnosis is not in doubt. For many disorders, however, each family has its own mutation and it is difficult to offer genetic testing to others in the family until that family’s particular disease-causing mutation has been identified. Determining whether an identified genetic variant is a disease-causing mutation may also be difficult and can require other approaches to resolve the uncertainty. The possibility of such ‘grey’ test results clearly has implications for genetic counselling and informed consent.

The best first step in predictive testing for such a disease is to look for a mutation in a definitely affected individual from the same family and then to test those relatives who are interested to see if they carry the same mutation. Once the family’s mutation has been found, it becomes possible for unaffected but at-risk relatives to seek predictive testing. The counselling – helping each individual to understand their situation, to recognise what the test can and cannot offer, and to weigh up the pros and cons of testing – can be challenging for the client and the professional and require very substantial time and energy. In contrast, both the formal procedure of documenting the client’s consent and the laboratory process of mutation testing is usually straightforward. The simplicity of the laboratory process could lend a misleading ‘aura’ of simplicity and straightforwardness to the whole package of ‘counselling plus testing’.

Testing one or more large and complex genes for an unknown, family-specific, disease-causing mutation is technically complex and expensive. However, one expects this to change dramatically over the next few years as the cost of sequencing continues to fall. Dependence upon access to the results of a mutation search in a relative will diminish and eventually vanish as the cost of sequencing falls and the ability to distinguish innocent variation from disease-causing mutations has improved. Even now it is often only the financial constraints within the UK’s National Health Service that leads UK practitioners to insist upon access to the mutation information in the records of their affected family member(s) before testing the at-risk relatives. This is because the cost of testing for a known mutation in one gene is very much less than the cost of full mutation searches in two large (and therefore expensive) genes (e.g., the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes or the PKD1 and PKD2 genes). The interpretation of test results within a family is often greatly improved by access to the results of the test on relatives but it will become gradually less appropriate to regard difficulties of access to these results as acceptable grounds for withholding genetic testing.

# Diagnostic testing

The most straightforward genetic testing context is diagnostic testing, performed when a patient presents with a clear and definite health problem. If the physician suspects that an illness or disorder may be caused by a genetic condition, the physician and the patient (or their parents) discuss this, the test is performed and the result is then presented to the patient (or their parents) along with any implications for treatment, further investigation or prognosis. Diagnostic testing by DNA-based, molecular genetic methods presents advantages over conventional diagnostic methods in several settings. For example, the conventional investigations for a number of neuromuscular disorders rely upon unpleasant and invasive procedures, such as muscle biopsy or electrophysiology, and molecular testing may be greatly preferable as well as cheaper once it can be relied upon to give a rapid and definitive result. If no diagnosis is made by the first line of molecular methods, however, then the decision has to be made as to whether to return to the conventional methods or to continue with molecular investigations into less frequent genetic causes for the patient’s symptoms. In any particular case, the questions of cost, convenience and the time waiting for results will be considered – often jointly by several professionals, and sometimes involving the patient too – alongside the physician’s assessment of the most probable diagnoses in determining what investigations to organise at each stage of the clinical process.

In such consultations, the patient seeks the assessment and opinion of the clinician and then chooses whether or not to accept the plan of investigation or management offered. There are of course pressures on patients to cooperate with the physician if they are anxious about their health or if they are having to accommodate to Talcott Parsons’ (1951) ‘sick role’, but they usually have the power to decline testing if only through defaulting from clinic attendance. The offer of genetic testing for diagnostic purposes will often arise in mainstream medicine and is not at all restricted to the genetics clinic. The issues that arise from the genetic nature of the disease cannot be evaded by choosing a non-genetic investigation as an alternative. The pressure to reach a diagnosis means that by one means or another the genetic basis of the patient’s problems will be revealed.

When the underlying genetic cause of a potentially inherited condition is known in one member of a family and a relative presents with similar problems, testing to see if the relative at risk has the same disease-causing mutation is often much quicker, simpler and cheaper than starting afresh to detect any mutation in a set of possibly implicated genes (as explained above). This sort of focussed molecular testing requires access to the genetic information already generated about other family members, so privacy issues may arise within the family. In such cases, there may be a need to obtain the consent of at least one other firstdegree relative in order to access the genetic test results already known and thereby to make testing available to other at-risk and anxious members of the family. At times, this clinical requirement can raise communicative challenges within the family based on existing dynamics. This can complicate the process of genetic testing, making it more prolonged than the at-risk individual had anticipated. The laboratory aspects, however, are relatively simple.5

# Predictive genetic testing

Predicting the course of an illness – its prognosis – has been part of medicine since the time of Hippocrates. Laboratory-based genetic testing can give predictive information because the genetic constitution of an individual remains more-or-less constant from conception. Age-related changes do accumulate and there are changes within tumours, especially malignant tumours, which can give information about the likely progression and response to treatment of the tumour. Otherwise, our genome is the one we were born with and is unchanged from conception. Genetic testing therefore permits ‘prediction’ even from before birth. If a person is at high risk of an inherited predisposition to cancer, and if one knows in this family what mutation is responsible in which gene, then it is feasible to look for this at any stage of life.

An individual may seek predictive testing when there is a strong family history of a condition affecting several close relatives or across several generations. Typically, this would involve a family history of neurological degeneration such as Huntington’s Disease (HD) or a strong predisposition to a type of cancer or heart disease. The family’s illness may have affected a parent, a grandparent and some uncles or aunts. The at-risk individuals may wonder, ‘Will I be next?’ If the condition is indeed genetic in their family, they may be at $5 0 \%$ (1 in 2) risk of carrying the responsible genetic mutation but their risk of disease may be somewhat less if not all those with the mutation develop the disease.

There may be very clear practical reasons for wanting to know who has the family’s disease-associated gene mutation, especially if there is something effective that can be done to prevent the disease or reduce its worst effects. In such circumstances, there may be good reason to perform testing even on the young or otherwise incompetent, who could not give consent but could directly benefit from interventions of established safety and efficacy if they were shown to carry the relevant mutation. An at-risk individual may then be expected and encouraged by professionals to make the ‘responsible’ decision and agree to the offer of testing. The question of the circumstances in which it is acceptable – or necessary – to perform genetic tests on a child at risk of inherited disease has been a topic of discussion for at least 20 years and is considered further below and in later chapters (Clarke 1994).

If there is no clearly effective medical intervention, then the decision whether to have a predictive genetic test becomes more difficult. Those individuals at high risk often feel torn between wanting to know (that they have not inherited the family’s mutation) and dreading that the result might be unfavourable; they may consider, however, that the need to plan their lives more carefully, if they have inherited the condition, justifies the test. Elsewhere, we have referred to the decision-making process in the clinical setting as weighing the ‘risks of knowing against the ‘benefits of knowing’ (Sarangi et al. 2003). While some people ‘just want to know’, others wish to use the information in making specific decisions about having their own children or planning their career, business or lifestyle (Sarangi et al. 2004). They may also wish to know whether to pass on information about the condition and their risk of developing it to any children they may already have. In this position, parents at risk of a genetic condition will often feel torn between the need to discharge their responsibility to pass on this information to their (mature) children and their personal wish not to have to do this, often experienced as the need to protect their children from such distressing knowledge (Hallowell et al. 2003). The genetic counselling provided in advance of predictive tests aims to help clients think through the implications of their decision, perhaps to reassess it, and to consider whether, or when and how, to talk about their genetic risk within the family or with others (see Sarangi et al. 2003 and Sarangi et al. 2004 with regard to counselling in the HD clinic).

The factors that may need to be considered in advance of a predictive test become still more tangled under particular circumstances. This may arise, for example, if the affected individual in the family is a grandparent and the intervening son or daughter at $5 0 \%$ (1 in 2) risk of HD does not want to be tested but their adult son or daughter (grandchild of the affected individual) does want clarification about their genetic status. How is this situation to be resolved, when a positive (unfavourable) result on the grandchild declares the genetic status of their parent as positive too, and results in the $2 5 \%$ risk faced by their brothers or sisters increasing automatically to $5 0 \%$ ? This can be seen as a conflict between the grandchild’s autonomy and that of their parent; any resolution is likely to require dialogue and communication among members of the family. Genetic counselling in the clinic setting at least provides a necessary platform to facilitate the difficult family communication trajectories by means of reflective talk (Sarangi et al. 2004).

Another difficult setting arises when predictive testing for a late-onset disorder with no useful medical intervention is requested for a child. If the child requests testing, then it will be necessary for the professionals involved to discuss the pros and cons of testing very carefully, both to enhance the child’s understanding and also to assess their ‘maturity’. If it is the child’s parents who have requested testing, then the reasoning behind that request will need to be explored. Professionals will want to preserve the child’s ability to contribute to the discussion and to the decision making. This will often entail deferring any test until the ‘child’ can make their own decision. If the parents very much wish testing to proceed immediately – perhaps to resolve their own anxiety in face of continuing uncertainty – then this may be seen as a conflict between parental autonomy and the child’s future autonomy. Under UK law, such decisions need to be made based on the ‘best interests’ of the child rather than parental rights.

# Carrier testing

In families affected by recessive diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease, it is often brothers and sisters who are affected, the parents being unaffected carriers. Both the parents and all the children of an affected person will be carriers. The brothers and sisters of affected individuals may or may not be unaffected carriers (if unaffected, the sibling of an affected person has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier). Carriers of a recessive disease will usually be perfectly healthy and show no sign of the disease; they may even be at some biological advantage as this may be why the gene is sufficiently common in the community.

While the parents of an affected child will definitely be carriers, the secondand third-degree relatives may also carry one of the two mutations present in the affected child. They can therefore be offered mutation testing, to see if any of them are also carriers. If they are carriers and wish to see if they have a chance of having an affected child, then their partners can be tested for the range of mutations found in that population. This process of offering tests by networking out through a kinship is often termed ‘family cascade testing’. While the test itself is technically simple, there may be many social complexities and obstacles, such as a reluctance to discuss the disease and its inheritance beyond the circle of the immediate nuclear family. This can be a particular problem in communities that practice arranged marriages, since unmarried adults carrying a genetic disorder (or with a family history of genetic disease) may be regarded as less attractive as potential spouses. This social dimension to genetic disease means that young couples may not be given access to the information they would need in order to make their own decisions about the risk of having an affected child. These are difficult issues that involve sometimes tense or even bitter communication (or non-communication) within extended families (see Chapter 6).

# Sex-linked inheritance and female carriers

Males have only one copy of each gene on the X chromosome: if a gene on a male’s single X chromosome contains a mutation that disrupts its function, then he will be affected by the corresponding disease. When an affected male is diagnosed, the question may arise as to whether his mother and perhaps some other female relatives could be carriers. An apparently ‘new’ case of a sex-linked disorder in a male may have arisen just in him (on the X chromosome he inherited from his mother) or may have been passed from earlier generations, so there may be a number of female relatives carrying the condition. So, is his mother a carrier? If so, are other female relatives carriers as well?

While it is usually clear if a male is affected by a sex-linked condition, the situation with the female is more complex. A woman has two X chromosomes in each cell but only one is (fully) functional while the other one is (largely) inactive. For most X chromosome genes, therefore, a woman has only one active copy in each cell. Each cell in the early female embryo inactivates (at random) one of the two $\mathrm { X }$ chromosomes. The descendants of each cell maintain inactivation of the same $\mathrm { X }$ so that a woman is in effect mosaic, with different patches of tissue making use of the two different X chromosomes. Whether or not a female carrier will manifest clinical signs of the condition is a difficult question that depends upon the chance pattern of $\mathrm { X }$ inactivation but also upon the nature of the gene and its function. For most $\mathrm { X }$ chromosome conditions, a female carrier may or may not show signs of her carrier status. If it is not apparent on clinical examination, one may have to turn to genetic testing to find out if a woman is a carrier.

Family awareness of the genetic risk of sex-linked disorders may be low, so that they are caught unawares when another affected boy is born, while in other families awareness may be high so that the young women at risk of being carriers seek testing to find out if they do indeed carry the family disorder (see Chapter 6). Of course, individuals will often respond to family pressure in their own particular ways; while some conform to the family’s expectations and seek testing, others may go ahead with pregnancies without prior testing to clarify their genetic status and without prenatal testing if they are carriers (Parsons and Clarke 1993). Preferences and dispreferences for testing can also be influenced by cultural and religious norms. These differences in the way that families and individuals approach the question of responsibility in the context of reproductive decisionmaking are important; how professionals respond to such behaviour also conveys crucial information about the way in which professionals understand their role.

# Chromosome rearrangements: diagnostic and carrier testing

The pattern of transmission of chromosome rearrangements through families is rather similar to X-linked inheritance except that they can be passed by an unaffected carrier of either sex to affect a child of either sex; they can also be passed through multiple generations of an extended family. The unaffected carriers of the rearrangement will have it in a ‘balanced’ form which may cause them no problems except that the production of normal gametes (eggs or sperm) becomes more difficult. When two different chromosomes exchange material to form a reciprocal translocation, for example, this often has no effect except in relation to reproduction: it is more difficult for such a translocation carrier to transmit the correct, single copy of every chromosome to a child. Those in the next generation who are then affected by an unbalanced form of the chromosome rearrangement are likely to have serious problems with physical and cognitive development as a result of deletions and/or duplications of chromosomal segments. If the segments involved are large, then the chromosomally unbalanced progeny are likely to miscarry rather than surviving to be born. In such a case, the clinical presentation may be with multiple miscarriages or even apparent infertility.

# Testing and screening

At this stage, it is necessary to distinguish genetic testing from ‘screening’. In this volume, screening refers to the practice of making a test available to the whole population or a specific subpopulation as opposed to testing an individual on the grounds that they may be at increased risk of a genetic disorder. In terms of technical differences, we should note that a screening test offered to many individuals may not be as specific or as sensitive as the test offered to an individual at particularly high risk of a genetically transmissible condition. However, there is also the experience of the client to consider and the monitoring or evaluation of the screening programme as a whole. Both may differ in important ways from regular medical practice, including genetic tests of individuals accompanied by counselling sessions.

Those offered population screening tests are likely to have little or no knowledge of the conditions for which screening is being made available, and will be responding to an offer made to them. Those offered testing as individuals because of a family history will often be better informed, will often have actively sought out medical attention, and will have requested testing. Screening programmes therefore need to pay attention to the ways in which the screening test is made available, so that those who accept the offer of screening have made a carefully considered decision on the basis of adequate information and are less likely to regret their choice than if they accept the offer of testing without any prior understanding.

Equally important is the need to monitor a screening programme to ensure that it operates for the benefit of the population and especially the participants. There will be some who take part in screening but who suffer great distress because of it and some who are caught up in a process of medicalisation but gain no health benefits (Raffle and Gray 2007). Some of those who should be identified are missed or overlooked. There are very real dangers if the outcomes to be measured fail to reflect the goals that the screening programme was designed to achieve. If care is not taken, a programme can be driven by artificial targets so that, for example, a process measure such as uptake of a test becomes a goal that needs to be maximised. In genetic screening programmes, there is a recurrent temptation to maximise the financial savings ‘achieved by’ the termination of pregnancies carrying foetuses affected by conditions that could be seen as ‘costly’ (Clarke 1997a). In relation to antenatal screening for Down syndrome, for example, it would be clearly unethical for the principal outcome measure to be set as the number of terminations of pregnancy in which the foetus has Down syndrome. In such programmes, eugenic incentives could systematically distort the delivery of healthcare, leading to manipulation of the participants through an ethos of pressure and coercion.

# Population genetic screening

In this section, we consider the development of population screening and explain what kind of screening services are routinely offered during and after pregnancy. The social impact of screening programmes is discussed briefly, though the ethical and eugenic implications of newborn and antenatal screening are discussed elsewhere (Chapters 3 and 8).

# Antenatal screening for chromosome disorders and malformation

Antenatal screening programmes for chromosome disorders and malformation have grown in a fairly haphazard fashion, depending upon local interests and resources and often being driven by developments in technology. In areas with a high incidence of neural tube defects, amniocentesis used to be routinely offered with an assay being performed to measure the amniotic $\mathfrak { a }$ -fetoprotein (AFP) level. This had the disadvantage at the time of causing miscarriages in about 1 in 50 pregnancies and the number of amniocenteses was cut dramatically when it was realised that high amniotic fluid AFP levels were associated with raised maternal serum AFP. Once maternal serum AFP (msAFP) was being measured frequently, accumulated data showed that msAFP was lower than average in pregnancies where the foetus had Down syndrome. As the incidence of neural tube defects fell, a new industry of maternal serum screening arose with the goal of identifying Down syndrome pregnancies and ‘giving the option’ of termination.

In parallel with these developments, foetal ultrasonography was also being developed. It has now become a highly sophisticated field of expertise. Ultrasound can be used at different stages of pregnancy, and sometimes in conjunction with maternal serum markers, to indicate pregnancies likely to be carrying a foetus with Down syndrome. It can also be used to search for malformation that may indicate a poor prognosis, or an underlying chromosomal anomaly, or circumstances in which the baby may benefit from delivery in a referral unit that is able to perform early cardiac or surgical interventions.

The relevance of these programmes to genetic testing more generally is substantial because antenatal screening is often regarded as ‘genetic’ although the technologies routinely employed are biochemical and ultrasonic and the professionals engaged in this are midwives and obstetricians (neither being part of genetic services in the UK). Three points need to be raised. First, the offer of antenatal screening to every pregnant woman has changed the experience of those wanting to be pregnant so that there is now a quality of being provisional or tentative about a pregnancy until it has ‘passed’ the screening tests (Rothman 1986, Rapp 1999). One is cautious about welcoming an early pregnancy not only in case a miscarriage might occur but also in case antenatal screening indicated a problem and one chose to terminate the pregnancy, despite its having been planned and wanted. Second, it is clear that, when screening programmes are routinised, they are difficult to decline and the possible disadvantages of screening are neither well researched nor adequately discussed with women before they enter the programme. Efforts have been made to improve these points but they do not seem to have yet been fully effective. Both those points carry important lessons for any extension to current screening programmes. Third, there are broader social implications of screening ‘for’ (or is it ‘against’?) disability in general (Shakespeare 2006, Parens and Asch 2000). One can consider whether those currently affected by Down syndrome, achondroplasia, Turner syndrome or cystic fibrosis would be justified in taking offence at the apparent collective decision of society to identify ‘their’ conditions before birth, with the entirely foreseeable result that this will reduce the incidence of these and other kinds of conditions.

Such issues are not about to fade from public attention. Indeed, new technologies are being developed that are likely to present even more of us with difficult choices that we might prefer not to face during a pregnancy to which we might prefer to feel an unreserved commitment. It is becoming possible to isolate and analyse foetal DNA from maternal blood, so that any woman accounting for her reluctance to have an invasive procedure (that would put the pregnancy at risk) as their reason for declining foetal diagnostic tests will no longer be able to hide behind that shield: it will take even more moral and emotional strength than it does now for a woman to decline a non-invasive foetal test because it will be a simple blood test performed on the mother.

# Carrier screening programmes

Screening to identify unaffected carriers of some autosomal recessive disorders have been introduced within some countries and communities over the past few decades. Population carrier screening for the haemoglobin disorders has been technically feasible for many years but the ability to offer prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester is more recent.6 The availability of testing (and termination) before ‘quickening’ (the onset of easily felt foetal movements), has been important in that an early termination of pregnancy is more acceptable to many individuals and also to some communities and faith traditions.

While the active promotion of carrier screening for sickle cell disease among Afro-Americans in the USA during the 1970s proved unsuccessful because of the context of institutional racism within which it operated, screening for $\beta$ -thalassaemia was implemented in Cyprus in 1973 with the active support of the Greek Orthodox Church, which requires proof of carrier testing before marriage.

The first systematic carrier screening programme to be made available within a specific ethnic community in Britain was screening for Tay-Sachs disease among the Ashkenazi Jewish community, where the disease incidence is comparable to that of cystic fibrosis in the UK overall. This screening was introduced by and through the community itself and there has been no sense of the community being stigmatised or oppressed by screening although there may be minor psychological sequelae among those identified as carriers (Marteau et al. 1992). Small groups within the community that reject abortion have accepted screening but on their own terms (e.g., the Dor Yeshorim system of genetic screening before arranged marriage ensures that marriages in which both members of the couple would carry the same disorders are avoided; see Ekstein and Katsenstein 2001).

Screening to identify carriers of cystic fibrosis among the white British majority was piloted in a series of initiatives in the early 1990s. These demonstrated that many will comply with an active offer of screening but that few are motivated to seek it if much effort is required to do so, such as attending an additional clinic appointment. The disease incidence is 1 in $\sim 2 { , } 5 0 0$ and the carrier frequency is $\sim 1$ in 25 so that many carriers are identified for whom the information will never be of any relevance. With the development of microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies, it is already a technically simple matter to determine carrier status for a large number of autosomal recessive (and sex-linked) disorders. This may change public attitudes to testing and interest in the results because so many individuals will be identified as carriers once the test is comprehensive; the question shifts from being ‘Am I a carrier of disease X?’ to ‘For what conditions am I a carrier?’

If identified before they conceive a child, carrier couples will in the future be able to find out that they carry a mutation in the same gene and would therefore be at high $( 2 5 \% )$ risk of having an affected child. Carrier couples could then be given the option of prenatal diagnosis (PND) or other reproductive interventions before having an affected child, whereas at present this is usually only feasible for those couples (or their close family members) who already have an affected child. Whether or not this is seen as a boon or as a burden is, of course, still open for discussion.

# Newborn screening programmes

Most of the conditions identified through newborn screening programmes are genetic, except for congenital hypothyroidism (CH), which is usually the result of malformation of the thyroid gland (or, in some impoverished parts of the globe, iodine deficiency).7 Affected infants are not identified through genetic tests, however, but through the assay of the levels of an increasingly wide range of metabolites in the infant’s blood. While testing for each disease used to be a separate process, testing for most is now carried out simultaneously with high-throughput tandem mass spectroscopy (TMS). It is the ready availability and the high capacity of this equipment that is lengthening the list of diseases for which screening is now being provided in many developed countries. There are discussions to be had about the criteria that should be satisfied before a population screening programme should be introduced, and indeed whether ‘newborn screening’ should be considered as a single item, as whatever can be delivered by the technology in a take-it-or-leave-it offer, or whether a separate decision should be made about screening for each disease that could be detected, according to a stricter set of criteria.

Newborn screening was introduced in many countries around 1970 for phenylketonuria (PKU) because the outlook for infants diagnosed early and given the appropriate diet is excellent, while children identified later because of problems with growth and development have severe and irreversible cognitive damage. The case for screening for CH is similarly strong but the benefit of screening for some other disorders is less overwhelming or even weak. Professionals and families support screening for CF but the long-term health benefits have yet to be established. Where the benefits may accrue to the family as a whole, rather than the affected child, it may be important to emphasise this in the ‘information and consent’ process leading up to the screening test. If there is no specific treatment available before the onset of symptoms, parents may wish to decide whether they would want to know about the condition in advance of a clinical diagnosis. This applies, for example, to screening for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (currently available as an optional screening test for male infants in Wales), fragile $\mathrm { X }$ syndrome and some of the organic acidaemias.

# Conclusion

We have presented an overview of the historical development of genetic tests and genetic screening programmes. For the most part, genetic tests in the context of Mendelian disorders and chromosome anomalies deliver what is expected of them. The principal form of testing established in everyday medical practice and of proven utility is testing to identify the concealed Mendelian subgroups of conditions, which manifest in families where the risk of disease is indeed high. The clarification of risk status of individuals within these families can be helpful clinically and psychosocially. The clinical benefits include the ability to make appropriate decisions about surveillance for complications of the disorder or guidance as to appropriate treatments and approaches to prevention including prophylactic surgery. For those without a strong family history of disease, however, there is little to recommend surveying a selection of SNPs to determine the relative risk of disorders such as coronary artery disease, stroke and cancer. The ‘healthy living advice given to all risk groups is essentially the same and the limited evidence available does not suggest that knowledge of genetic risk has much effect on compliance with advice about lifestyle and diet except to a limited extent in the context of those affected by Mendelian genetic conditions (McBride et al. 2010,

Claassen et al. 2010). This is no surprise given the persistence of smoking in the face of medical evidence and public health campaigns and financial disincentives imposed through taxation. The differences in risk between individuals will usually only be modest, especially if one looks at the overall pattern of risk across the diseases and if one acknowledges that the (often inflated) estimates of heritability accounted for by GWAS-based genetic profile testing is at best modest. There is no reason to think that these risk assessments currently have anything to offer healthcare that is not already provided by measures of simpler intermediate phenotypes such as blood pressure, serum cholesterol and apolipoproteins (McQueen et al. 2008, Edelman and Eng 2009, van der Net et al. 2009).

The consequence of this for genetic counselling is that the major issues arising in ‘traditional’ genetic counselling – that relate to the adjustment of genetic disease in the family, to predictive and prenatal genetic testing and to family communication – simply do not arise in the context of the complex disorders. The skills required to help individuals adjust to their risk of such disorders have more to do with behaviour change, such as smoking cessation and lifestyle coaching, than with genetic counselling as conventionally practised.

In subsequent chapters, we look in detail at the way in which some of these professional perspectives on ‘conventional’ genetic testing are played out when they come up against the reality of specific families with their own personal concerns and their own ways of making decisions and taking responsibility for their actions. The various actors each have only a partial view of the events in which they are participating and we dwell at length on the accounts given by family members and professionals of how they understand their actions and decisions. We consider how family members respond to and make sense of their experiences of genetic counselling and testing; we relate these accounts to the process of genetic counselling as understood from the professional’s perspective. In addition, we look at some of the more recent, commercial offers of genome-based testing for susceptibility to complex diseases and discuss the extent to which promotional rhetoric blurs the distinction between diagnosis and prediction.

Turning to the new sequencing technologies, it is clear that we have arrived at ‘the beginning of the end’. While the human genome sequence was hyped as the Holy Grail, genetic information could be applied to patients but only one gene at a time. Genetic information has been diagnostically useful for more than 40 years in relation to chromosome disorders and for more than 20 years for Mendelian diseases, but we will soon have full genome sequences on patients which will allow us to look simultaneously across all genes. This information about an individual is the one (more or less) constant item in their biological constitution: everything else is dynamic, fluctuating and continuously renewed. However, to what extent it will give scope to understand the biology of disease in each individual is uncertain; even less certain is the future scope for therapeutic interventions in individual patients based upon knowledge of their personal genetic information, or even their complete genome sequence.

# 3 Neo-liberalism and the new genetics

# Introduction

In this chapter, we explore the key notions of responsibility, autonomy and blame in relation to the changing political, economic and social context of health and genetics. The idea of ‘neo-liberalism’ provides an important perspective with which to compare contemporary genetics with earlier eugenic programmes. Since the 1970s and 1980s, the positioning of the individual within advanced liberal democracies has changed significantly. The expansion and production of choice in the market economy (Hayek 1944, Polanyi 1957, Klein 2007) has not only redefined the rights and obligations of citizen-consumers, but it has significantly altered the relationship between health professionals and patients (Maynard 1991, Herzlinger 1996, Rose 1999). We argue that the impact of genetic testing on health professionals, individuals and families can be characterised by a shift in the relationship between autonomy and responsibility. One way of coming to grips with the neo-liberal context of new genetic technologies is to understand how these changes are reflected in discourse as outlined in the introductory and methodological chapters (see Chapters 1 and 4).

We shall proceed by defining the key discursive features of neo-liberalism. What is distinctive about the language of neo-liberalism and how does it construct new ways of relating to health and genetic technologies? We then examine classic examples of eugenic language to understand how notions of autonomy and responsibility have been constructed in the past. This is followed by a similar analysis of the new genetics: what is ‘new’ about the new genetics and how is the relationship between autonomy and responsibility rearranged? We will argue that increasing health consumerism and personalisation of risk have become pervasive features of the new genetics.

# Principles of neo-liberalism

What has become variously known as ‘advanced liberalism’ or ‘neo-liberalism’ describes a marked shift from state-centred approaches to government. Though the finer points are debatable, most would agree that neo-liberalism embraces notions of ‘less government’ by transferring responsibilities to individuals in the name of freedom and choice. Many commentators argue that neo-liberalism is a project that seeks to foster individual and communal self-governance (Tribe 1981, Dean 1991, Rose 1993, 1996, Burchell 1993). Within the framework of neo-liberal homo economicus, individuals are conceptualised as ‘rational’, ‘autonomous’, ‘selfinterested’ and ‘competitive’, all of which describe the qualities of a kind of behaviourist model of economic theory (Gordon 1991). This argument radically suggests that individuals are literally ‘made up’ to meet the particular objectives of a given society – in this case, a capitalist, market-driven society sustained by an isolated and self-motivated individual. This particular version of individuality is contrasted with the default assumption that people have no intrinsic nature but have a nature ascribed to them by the society they live in.

According to Bourdieu (1998), neo-liberalism is a political programme for the reconstruction of society in the name of global capitalism. It is not so much an ideology embraced by any one political party; both conservatives and social democrats draw from the logics of the market and the presumed inevitability of ‘globalisation’ (Fairclough 2000, Rose 1999, Klein 2007). Some argue that it represents a weakening of democracy because the reduction of government no longer guarantees the security of its citizens (Fairclough 2001, 2003). Rather than protecting people from the negative effects of the market, it drastically reduces social welfare and encourages self-sufficiency. As a philosophy or rationality of government, neo-liberalism encompasses a very broad field of policy-related domains such as industry (post-Fordism, Amin 1994), economics (fiscal conservatism, Barber 1985), welfare (welfare-to-work reform, Murray 1984), politics (the Third Way, Giddens 1994, 1998) and healthcare (privatisation and consumerism, Maynard 1986).

Despite its various forms, most commentators would agree that neo-liberalism embraces a twofold programme: (i) it seeks to reconstruct the geography of political power to increase the flow of global capitalism and to extend the logics of the ‘free market’; and (ii) it seeks to reshape the rights and responsibilities of individuals to increase the role of economic self-sufficiency and self-governance. In the context of healthcare reform, neo-liberalism has been described as a mentality comprising three central principles: individualism, privatisation, and decentralisation (McGregor 2001). These principles have had the intended effect of producing a ‘consumer citizen’ who is expected to purchase healthcare in the marketplace. This extends to knowing one’s genetic risk and accepting self-responsibility to change one’s behaviour to minimise future risk (see Chapter 5). Patients have been transformed into consumers with rights and responsibilities, expected to voice their experiences in the consulting room, and to reduce their burden on the system by privately managing their health. In the next section, we briefly examine some of the main strategies that have transformed techniques of governing healthcare.

# Neo-liberalism and healthcare in Britain

Let us consider the extent to which a transformation in rationalities of government has profoundly altered the relation between expertise and political authority. This provides an important historical context to understand how our central themes in this book – autonomy, responsibility and blame – have emerged as a specific set of solutions to a broader crisis of governance within liberal democracies. Adapting the observations of others working in ‘governmentality studies’ (Dean 1991, Rose and Miller 1992, Rose 1993, 1999), we identify three interlinking strategies of rule (‘economic efficiency’, ‘accountability and autonomy’, ‘privatisation of risk management’) that describe the neo-liberal transformation of healthcare in Britain. This transformation in techniques of governing healthcare ‘at arms length’ has an important bearing for understanding the context in which genetic testing and counselling services are presently organised.

# Economic efficiency

The notion that good government is based on principles of ‘economic efficiency’ is not a new idea. The innovation of neo-liberalism does not lie with the rediscovery of a new set of ‘ideas’, but rather with an effective means of implementing strategies that were based on a critique of governance itself. During the 1970s, various attempts to reorganise the NHS in Britain had failed to resolve the poor and inequitable provision of services, the spiralling costs of its infrastructure and the implementation of an effective management structure (BMJ, 1978). By the 1980s, these failures were increasingly framed as problems of rational planning, the centralisation of authority, and the paternalism of professionals and administrators who remained largely unaccountable for their actions (Rose 1993). What powerfully illustrated the shortcomings of the NHS was not the disorganisation of authority, but that professional authority itself had become an obstacle to the delivery of an efficient and effective health service (Rivett 1998).

By 1986, the NHS was in crisis and regularly criticised in the media. One despairing article in the BMJ described it as becoming:

a political, statistical, and managerial battleground … The answers lie in the massive complexity of the NHS, the largest organisation in Europe outside the Red Army. (BMJ 1986: 1623)

The most dramatic change in its history came after the Conservative victory in 1987, when the bipartisan approach between politicians and medical professionals ended. Economic efficiency was now founded on principles of competition, marketisation, consumer empowerment, financial accountability and quality assurance. The status of the professions was reduced to merely another lobby rather than carrying ‘a special imprimatur’ based on the values of clinical freedom and medical paternalism (Rivett 1998). As Rose argues, the versatility of neo-liberalism was the capacity to penetrate the enclosures of professional authority by creating the technical means for exercising ‘perpetual scrutiny over the authority of authority’ without explicit interference from policy makers (Rose 1993: 295). Economic efficiency was best achieved not by acts of planning and compulsion but through acts of choice in the ‘free market’.

Perhaps one of the most distinctive shifts in the liberalisation of health services in Britain was the shift in focus from sickness to health (Petersen and Lupton, 1996). Health promotion and illness prevention became a routine part of medical care, which emphasised more targeted screening for disease. The release in 1992 of the white paper, The Health of the Nation, signalled a major shift in British health policy that combined techniques of target setting and health promotion with principles of marketisation. The best way to improve the efficiency of medical services was to reduce the burden of illness through education. Health promotion would encourage the public to reduce lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, raised blood pressure, misuse of alcohol, diet, etc. The routine availability of genetic screening programmes, such as prenatal testing, would play a greater role in terms of the preventive benefits for future populations and the expected cost savings in the longer term. This combination of economic efficiency, disease prevention and marketisation would lead to further screening of the population, often framing justifications for such programmes in terms of ‘cost–benefit analysis’ (Duster 1990, Shakespeare 1998).

# Accountability and autonomy

One way of increasing the efficiency of the health service while at the same time resolving the crisis of governing authority was to implement systems of accountability. During the 1980s and 1990s, a range of devices were employed to create a distance between formal political decisions and medical professionals (Rose 1993). The once antagonistic relationship between administrators and clinicians was replaced by techniques of accounting, financial management, budget disciplines and medical audit. A new kind of professional appeared in the 1980s – the health economist – charged with developing principles for the efficient use of scare resources. The health economist became instrumental in designing incentive mechanisms and budgetary constraints to channel clinicians into ‘more efficient behaviour’ (Mooney and Drummond 1982: 1330).

Other forms of measurement and calculation were designed to increase efficiency by making professionals accountable to the ‘cost–utility’ of medical intervention. Borrowing from techniques devised in the USA, Williams and Maynard popularised the notion of ‘quality-adjusted life-years’ (QALYs), which attempted to measure life expectancy and quality of life (Maxwell 1984, Williams 1985). Healthcare resources were allocated on the basis of whether an intervention had a lower cost to QALY ratio. Essentially utilitarian in character, this method of calculation operated under the assumption that health resources were scarce and that the cost of interventions were justified in terms of the approximate benefit to the largest proportion of patients. The introduction of population screening, notably antenatal and newborn screening, can be seen as programmes that reduce the burden of genetic disorders on healthcare. Another method of improving patient care was devised around medical audit, a process of systematically reviewing care against explicit criteria of standards and definitions of good practice. Although used on a largely voluntary basis in the 1970s, by 1993 the medical audit was formally implemented as a process for monitoring the quality of care, establishing accountability, and allocating and managing resources efficiently (Swage 2000).

But if systems of accountability were techniques for disciplining professionals by means of targets, standards, measurements and review processes, they also enjoined new responsibilities for ‘consumer-patients’. While the rhetoric of choice represented a real increase in consumer power, it meant that patients were to some degree now accountable for their own health: one must choose wisely, rationally and responsibly. Part of the devolved responsibilities of market-based approaches to healthcare also meant that medical practitioners assumed a more collaborative role between parties. New terminologies and practices such as ‘patient-centredness’, ‘active’ patienthood, and later, ‘shared decision-making’, were designed to recruit patient autonomy in decisions over treatment (Armstrong 1984, Charles et al. 1997, Elwyn et al. 1999).

In the context of genetic counselling explicit efforts were made to promote a particular version of autonomy. While in the 1970s and 1980s emphasis was given to accurate information-giving and principles of non-directiveness (Bosk 1992), by the 1990s emphasis was placed on issues of communication (Kenen and Smith 1995). Good counselling was increasingly seen as a process in which clients were assisted to make competent decisions. In fact, the term ‘client’ emphasised the capacities of a knowledgeable and sophisticated consumer, capable of engaging in independent decision-making (Brock 1995). However, efforts to enrol client autonomy were not without their difficulties. Non-directiveness, whether or not attainable in practice, appeared to be in conflict with broader policy goals of measuring efficiency in medical genetics (Royal College of Physicians 1989). Measuring ‘success’ in genetic counselling was based on the number of terminations performed as a result of counselling (Clarke 1990). How can outcome measures designed to increase the efficiency and accountability of the profession square itself with the apparent autonomy of clients (for an empirical analysis see Sarangi 2010a)?

Responding to Clarke’s (1990) concerns about the use of such measures in genetic counselling, Chadwick (1993: 44) argues that medical audit exemplifies ‘a political ideology [that] distorts the concept of autonomy’. This distortion becomes evident if we consider that outcome measures do not in fact contradict a belief in autonomy. Rather ‘[t]he drive towards what is described as a more efficient health service goes hand in hand with the purported upholding of consumer choice, underpinned by an expressed belief in the value of autonomy’ (1993: 44). In genetic counselling, systems of accountability induce not only professional autonomy as being less dependent upon public funding for scarce resources, but also a version of client autonomy based on the political value of ‘self-reliance’ rather than self-determination. Chadwick claims that pursuing objectives by means ‘compatible with autonomy’ is not the same as saying that autonomy is itself the objective. In subtle ways, women might be ‘pressurised’ to consider a termination in the name of autonomy when in fact there are constraints on the choices on offer. Thus, the restriction of choice is in itself a new form of professional control and authority within neo-liberal audit culture.

# Privatisation of risk management

The idea that one had to take active steps to secure one’s future by joining voluntary insurance schemes has existed since the nineteenth century. By the twentieth century, such schemes were nationalised in the form of compulsory social insurance. The creation of the NHS in Britain embodied this kind of thinking – that universal health insurance would provide security for citizens by pooling risks across a lifetime. It was this legacy of the welfare state that emphasised universal rights and principles of solidarity which addressed citizens as members of a collective (Marshall 1983). By the 1980s and 1990s, a strategic shift in the politics of security meant that social insurance was no longer seen as universal and collective, but conditional and participatory.

A distinct feature of neo-liberal rationalities of government is the way in which the logics of economic efficiency, accountability and autonomy have become embedded in the calculation of future harms. The autonomous subject of neoliberalism is characterised by what O’Malley (1992, 1996) calls ‘prudentalism’: the capacity to sustain one’s autonomy by assembling information, materials and practices into personalised strategies that identify and minimise one’s exposure to risk (this is the focus of our discussion of commercialisation of genetic testing in Chapter 5). Others (Beck 1992, Giddens 1990) have claimed more generally that the growing awareness of global risks is a symptom of ‘modernisation’ and ‘risk society’.

In the medical context, a profound shift in the distribution of rights and responsibilities required that ‘[i]ndividuals and families should insure against the costs of ill health through private medical insurance, should make provisions for their future through private pensions, should take an active role in securing themselves against all that could possibly threaten the security of their chosen style of life’ (Rose 1999: 159). Armstrong (1995: 400) argues that the medical concept of risk became integral to a new kind of ‘surveillance medicine’ in which symptom, sign and disease were subsumed ‘under a more general category of ‘‘factor’’ that points to, though does not necessarily produce, some future illness’. This provided new ways of mapping illness by calculating probabilities of risk and by devising strategies of prevention. By the late 1980s, screening programmes for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer as well as high blood cholesterol and diabetes were routinely used to monitor populations and promote healthy lifestyles. The ‘new prudentialism’ of healthcare employed techniques of counselling, communication, advertising and marketing to encourage people to privately master their fate by engaging in responsible forms of risk management (Rose 1999).

Genetic testing is one context that explicitly encourages individuals, couples or families to reflect upon the consequences of genetic information. Being ‘genetically at risk’ no longer embodies the kind of fatalism associated with genetic determinism. Instead, genetic risk has become visible within ‘a political and ethical field in which individuals are increasingly obligated to formulate life strategies, to seek to maximise their life chances, to take actions, and to act prudently in relation to themselves and to others’ (Rose 2007: 107). The complex choices arising from prenatal testing and preimplantation diagnosis meant that the autonomy and responsibility of clients played a more prominent role in genetic consultations. Techniques of shared decision-making, ethical reflection and risk communication about the actual or possible dynamics of disclosing genetic information to at-risk relatives formed a routine part of ‘facilitating the autonomy’ of clients (Petersen and Bunton 2002).

Having considered how genetic services are organised and embedded within a distinct rationality of self-government and private risk management, the task is to revisit earlier ideas of heritability to understand how biological knowledge became entangled within classical liberal thought. In the next section, we contrast this neo-liberal formula of autonomy/responsibility with a nineteenth century discourse on eugenics.

# The language of eugenics

It might seem unusual that one could draw parallels between neo-liberalism and eugenics. And yet both share a utopian view of improving the health and welfare of society through moral reform; both have been used to justify laissez-faire economic policies; and both share similar origins within classical political economy. In what follows, we describe and illustrate some of the main themes within the political discourse of eugenics. Our purpose is to uncover the links between eugenic and economic utopias, to understand the broader historical context in which experts and professionals have actively sought to promote autonomy and responsibility as virtues of early liberal society. The ‘old genetics’ provides an important comparison for assessing the ways in which the eugenic implications of new genetic technologies are filtered through a rhetoric of scientific neutrality and personal autonomy.

Public imagination lends itself to a number of distortions about the impact and meaning of eugenics. It is often characterised as a monolithic programme of totalitarian state intervention, as a specific ideology of the professional middle classes and a powerful influence over social policy. These beliefs have become standard because we are used to thinking of eugenics as a uniform ‘movement’. In fact, Searle (1998) argues that eugenics was a diffuse set of ideas and practices that was much less influential on social policy in Britain than it was in America, Germany and Scandinavia. Given the diversity of theories, programmes and policies that are routinely grouped under the name of ‘eugenics’, we will only concentrate on those aspects relevant to Britain. What follows is not an exhaustive analysis, but an examination of three key features that characterise the discourse of eugenics in Britain: ‘evolution’, ‘quality’ and ‘competition’.

# Evolution

The idea that human progress obeyed ‘laws of nature’ predates Darwin’s (1859) theory of ‘natural selection’ as well as Galton’s (1883) invention of ‘eugenics’. Writers such as Joseph Townsend (1786) and Thomas Malthus (1798) had already established that laws designed to relieve the poor should mirror the laws of nature, and that any law that disturbs the progress of ‘population’ will have disastrous consequences. Malthus’ immensely popular book, An Essay on the Principle of Population, triggered a moral panic after arguing that increasing population would outstrip food supply unless the growing numbers of the poor were ‘checked’. The Malthusian crisis provided a powerful argument against charitable relief of the poor and influenced other evolutionary theorists such as Darwin and Spencer. Indeed, Herbert Spencer (1857) envisioned the progressive development of ‘society’ in terms of biological principles:

Now, we propose in the first place to show, that this law of organic progress is the law of all progress. Whether it be in the development of the earth, in the development of life upon its surface, in the development of society, of government, of manufactures, of commerce, of language, literature, science, art, this same evolution of the simple into the complex, through successive differentiations, holds throughout. (Spencer 1857: 234)

Evolution and progress were the same unfolding process of progressive complexity and differentiation, ending in a state of human perfection. If Spencer’s vision of progress was simplistic and utopian, Darwin’s theory of evolution was dispassionate and sophisticated: natural selection was an open-ended process based on random variations that prospered or failed depending on their adaptation to environmental conditions.

Darwin deliberately avoided the topic of ‘man’ in The Origin of Species but later, in The Descent of Man, he touched upon the implications of evolution to social theory:

We civilised men … do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poorlaws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment … Thus the weak members of civilised society propagate their kind. No one who has attended the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of men. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed. (Darwin 1871: 151–52)

For Darwin, the peculiar dilemma of ‘civilised society’ is the practice of artificial selection (‘to check the process of elimination’) that interferes with the laws of nature. As a result of the sympathy of ‘civilised men’, the ‘weak members … propagate their kind’ (note how the language of ‘kind’ denotes a physically different class of ‘man’). Darwin does not explicitly claim a social policy or theory based on the failure of natural selection, but implies by way of analogy (‘the breeding of domestic animals’) that ‘this must be highly injurious to the race of men’. The efficacy of a biological discourse is precisely its objectivity, evading political and moral judgements about social reform by appealing scientifically to the iron clad laws of nature. In this pre-eugenic account, Darwin implies that weakness and infirmity are hereditary and that the existing poor laws encourage the ‘degeneration of a domestic race’.

Even before Darwin had published The Descent of Man, a discourse of middle-class radicalism (Parkin 1968) was proposing social reform by combining the evolutionary ideas of Malthus, Darwin and Spencer. A clear example is found in Greg’s (1874) disdainful account of the ‘non-survival of the fittest’. He argued that misguided legislation had restricted natural selection by discouraging the middle class from having large families and allowing the poor to multiply recklessly. Greg went on to propose an alternative vision of society where eugenic policy seeks to maximise evolutionary progress:

A republic is conceivable in which paupers should be forbidden to propagate; in which all candidates for the proud and solemn privilege of continuing an untainted and perfecting race should be subjected to a pass or a competitive examination, and those only be suffered to transmit their names and families to future generations who had a pure, vigorous, and well-developed constitution to transmit; so that paternity should be the right and function exclusively of the elite of the nation, and humanity be thus enabled to march on securely and without drawback to its ultimate possibilities of progress. (Greg 1874: 112)

Greg imagines a ‘republic’ where citizenship is conditional upon fitness. Nameless authorities conduct ‘a competitive examination’ of candidates with ‘a pure, vigorous and well-developed constitution’. There are two aspects of this account that are routinely found within a discourse of eugenics. The first imagines a ‘negative’ programme of prohibiting the reproductive rights of the unfit (i.e. the pauper). The second endorses a ‘positive’ programme of encouraging the breeding of ‘the elite of the nation’. Negative eugenics was by far the more energetic and salient application of Darwinism, while positive eugenic programmes would seek expression through relief and subsidies directed at middle-class families. The irony of Greg’s evolutionary utopia is the cruel use of authority to emulate the laws of natural selection. Others would later criticise the distinction between natural and artificial, suggesting that eugenic polices proposed their own form of artificial selection based on radical individualism and elitism (Ritchie 1891).

# Quality

At the heart of Darwinian natural selection is the idea of individual heredity. According to Darwin, the gradual and cumulative modification of race and species occurred via the selection of individual variations. The improvement or decline of race is therefore dependent on how these selections occur and the quality of the trait selected. The most distinguishing feature of eugenics is the belief that science could improve the quality of race. This is precisely what Galton had envisioned when he first defined ‘eugenics’ as:

the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognizance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. (Galton 1883: 24–25)

Despite the awkward definition, it is clear that science offers the ‘judicious’ advantage of discriminating ‘the more suitable races or strains of blood’. The term ‘stock’ is routinely used to denote the quality of the line of descent, a term that was already familiar to breeders of horses and dogs. The task of transforming ordinary notions of quality into a heritable entity required a novel explanation of its properties in terms of ‘energy’. It was the transmission of vigour, ‘the fullness of life’, that was amenable to measurement and normal distribution (Galton 1883: 25). However, it was not the principle of vigour itself that formed the proper target of concern, but rather the lack of it. Notions of ‘bad’ and ‘inferior’ stock offered new and imaginative explanations for prevailing ‘social’ concerns regarding urban deterioration. Many precursors to eugenic thinking as well as those who actively spoke in the name of eugenics argued that this ‘mingling of good and bad stock’ would lead to an irreversible state of degeneration. Already a popular idea in Europe, proponents of this theory, such as Morel (1857) and Lombroso (1899), argued that inferior traits such as criminality, alcoholism and feeble-mindedness were innate characteristics passed from one generation to another.

By the 1890s, the tension between Darwinian and Lamarckian theories of heredity had provided further justification for eugenic policies. Lamarckism held that an organism can transmit acquired characteristics to its offspring. Darwin himself retained aspects of Lamarckian mechanisms to explain how useful variations could survive from one generation to another without being dominated by the blending effects of natural selection (i.e. pangenesis). Galton had objected to the Lamarckian elements within Darwin’s theory and set out to disprove this. However, it was not until August Weismann (1892) had published his anti-Lamarckian germ-plasm theory that eugenics explanations were given a significant boost. The implications of Weismann’s theory placed greater emphasis on inter-breeding as a population phenomenon. It also allowed eugenicists to make even stronger claims about the irrelevance of social institutions and the need to improve the ‘stock’ of society. This view is articulated clearly in Pearson’s influential Grammar of Science:

If the views of Weismann be correct—if the bad man can by the influence of education and surroundings be made good, but the bad stock can never be converted into good stock—then we see how grave a responsibility is cast at the present day upon every citizen, who directly or indirectly has to consider problems relating to the state endowment of education, the revision and administration of the Poor Law, and, above all, the conduct of public and private charities. (Pearson 1892/1900: 26–27)

Pearson explains the implications of heredity in stark moral terms: while the social environment can improve the ‘bad’ individual, no amount of education, charity or reform can improve the quality of inheritable traits. It is implied that stock is not only the quality of constitution and intelligence, but also a physical sign of the moral character of individuals. Eugenic discourse offered a compellingly natural explanation for the redistribution of responsibility and blame. The future of society depended upon the selective inter-breeding of the population, which casts a ‘grave … responsibility … upon every citizen’. The linking of heredity to a political discourse of citizenship and responsibility is an appeal to the educated public that only selective reproduction will determine what kind of society the next generation will be. The underside of moral duty is of course the failure to observe it, in which case a eugenic discourse offers a systematic account of blame.

# Competition

As we have seen, a common eugenic appeal is the removal of laws that interfere with ‘the survival of the fittest’ and that hinder ‘individual advantage’. Both natural selection and individual heredity often coalesce into ideas of individual or national ‘competition’. Indeed Spencer and many American writers were keen to draw parallels between Darwinism and industrial-economic competition. Political theorists and social reformers appealed to Darwinian theory to justify laissez faire economic policies and to criticise collectivist politics (Farrall 1969). Concerned that ‘open competition’ would be regarded as a panacea for all social ills, one political commentator of the period, Ritchie (1891: 10), notes: ‘there can be no doubt that the formulae of Evolution do supply an apparent justification to the defenders of unrestricted laissez faire and to the champions … of existing inequalities of race, class and sex’.

According to Searle (1976), the topic of race improvement was popular in Edwardian Britain because of a ‘deep-seated anxiety’ that urban industrialisation had caused a degeneration of the national physique. The physiologist, John Berry Haycraft (1895), wrote that ‘racial deterioration’ was the result of not allowing competition ‘to bring forward the most capable competitors’. In the following passage, we see how the qualities that embody ‘the most capable competitor’ are synonymous with economic individualism:

Does it not appear that the present tendency is rather to give an advantage to the man who is capable, pushing and diplomatic; are we not selecting men with qualities of value in a struggle, qualities which savour still rather of talons and claws, while we are careless of qualities which we have learned already to value as those of a higher order? … Do not these impressions force us to believe that the man who most invariably gets on best is he who untiringly follows out his own advantage, who has one end and aim in life, which he pursues regardless of everything else; and that a course of life like this necessarily implies selfishness and want of regard for the wellbeing of others? (Haycraft 1895/1900: 133–34)

Haycraft asks whether the process of natural selection favours those who can gain their own advantage through struggle, perseverance and self-interest. The style of rhetorical questioning casts a belligerent tone, which does not so much suggest but ‘force us to believe’ that the pursuit of individual advantage belongs to ‘those of a higher order’.

Semmel (1968) has noted the versatility of ‘social Darwinism’ that could justify not only a radical economic individualism but also collectivist and socialist forms of government. Towards the close of the nineteenth century there were growing concerns over the decline of British imperialism. Britain’s leading eugenicist, Karl Pearson, advocated the role of science to advise the nation on how to increase its ‘efficiency’:

I fancy science will ultimately balance the individualistic and socialistic tendencies in evolution … The power of the individualistic formula to describe human growth has been overrated, and the evolutionary origin of the socialistic instinct has been too frequently overlooked. In the face of the severe struggle, physical and commercial, the fight for land, for food, and for mineral wealth between existing nations, we have every need to strengthen by training the partially dormant socialistic spirit, if we as a nation are to be among the surviving fit. The importance of organising society, of making the individual subservient to the whole, grows with the intensity of the struggle. We shall need all our clearness of vision, all our reasoned insight into human growth and social efficiency in order to discipline the powers of labour, to train and educate the powers of mind. (Pearson 1892/1900: 367)

Pearson appeals to science rather than politics or social theory to restore the perceived imbalance between individualism and socialism. The usual evolutionary emphasis on individual improvement is contrasted with programmes for ‘organising society’ and ‘training the partially dormant socialistic spirit’. The need to strengthen the nation is rendered all the more urgent by the ‘severe struggle’ taking place between nations over limited resources. Pearson demonstrates the flexibility of a discourse that can attribute the same organic qualities to a society as one would to an individual organism. The ‘socialistic instinct’ operates according to the same principles of natural selection in which nations struggle for survival. A eugenic account of biological improvement can justify seemingly contradictory extremes: it can argue for less government to promote individual advantage on the one hand, and argue for more government to promote a competitive society on the other (Farrall, 1969). The motif of efficiency is a distinctly British account of nation building via eugenic means, i.e., to encourage the better stock to have larger families while preventing its degenerate stock from multiplying.

# Uncovering the links between neo-liberalism and eugenics

We can draw a number of parallels between the discursive politics of eugenics and neo-liberalism. Both are essentially utopian discourses arguing for the reconstruction of liberal society. While eugenics utilises the prestige of science to justify the inherent superiority of one social class over another, neo-liberalism espouses an economic utopia that disavows social class inasmuch as all individuals are thought to have access to consumption and wealth-creation. Both discourses rely on ideas of progress as a key rhetorical trope. Eugenics draws upon an imaginary of powerful external forces and immutable individual qualities, the survival of which determines the quality of future generations of society. Neo-liberalism draws upon a similar imaginary of powerful global forces engaged in economic competition, but the language of determinism has taken on a new meaning within the language of contemporary liberal politics. A key difference is that while eugenics employs an essentialising language to frame the relationship between autonomy, responsibility and blame, neo-liberalism employs a discourse of openended flexibility. Individuals are constituted in terms of their ‘identities’, ‘potentials’ and self-regulating ‘capacities’ as opposed to having their nature fixed by principles of heredity. These profoundly different biopolitical utopias exemplify the contrast between discourses of determinism and discourses of self-determination.

One could identify a number of tensions that characterise the liberal politics of nineteenth century utopia: sympathy versus intolerance, equality versus elitism, socialism versus individualism, biology versus environment. Eugenics was ostensibly a professional and middle-class discourse that posed its own radical solutions to social reform and expressed a particularly intolerant attitude towards the emergence of the welfare state. Freedom was reserved to those who were economically independent and physically fit to carry the nation forward. But as Samuel Butler reminds us (see Chapter 1), freedom was also a natural order of moral and economic responsibility. Eugenic discourse attacked the reforms that seem to interfere with the natural emergence of a free-market economy.1

Contemporary liberal politics also resembles an intolerant view towards the welfare state and signals a return to economic individualism (hence the prefix ‘neo’). In the present context of increasing marketisation and privatisation, concepts such as autonomy and responsibility are being increasingly defined by virtues of self-interest, self-reliance, and flexibility. Rather than excluding those who fail to qualify as citizens of a ‘race’, neo-liberalism seeks to ‘include the socially excluded’ within circuits of flexible wage labour and within micro-moral ties of ‘community’. Rather than degeneration, we now talk about ‘cultures of dependency’ in which individuals suffer from various pathologies of will. Unlike the moral/biological language of the nineteenth century, today a moral/psychological language locates autonomy and responsibility within a new system of blame.

So far, we have argued that classical liberalism and neo-liberalism are two different kinds of ‘blame societies’ in which autonomy and responsibility emerge as specific kinds of historical problems. In order to show how our central themes in this book are relevant to contemporary practices of genetic testing, we need to consider an additional concept: the dimension of power.

Eugenics was the invention of nineteenth century ‘disciplinary society’ in which a moral-economic utopia could be fashioned out of direct and immediate forms of institutional punishment, coercion, regulation, etc. In contemporary liberal politics, methods of control are described as ‘post-disciplinary’ in that they seek to prevent conduct or pathology before it occurs (Deleuze 1995). Strategies of control are increasingly characterised by acting on flows of information for the calculation and prevention of risk. Risk management is now routinely incorporated within practices of psychiatry, medicine, genetics, criminology, social work and welfare. In the post-disciplinary society, risk management is not only a professional responsibility but also the personal responsibility of individuals – clients, patients, consumers, etc. Beyond the institutional walls of the hospital, the prison and the workhouse, the proliferation of modern systems of electronic marketing, record keeping, monitoring, profiling and data mining continuously ‘modulate’ the behaviour of the most risky (Rose 1999). As we will see in the next section, the emerging concept of ‘genetic risk’ manages to blur this distinction between control and freedom, between eugenics and individual choice.

# The meaning of the new genetics

One of the striking qualities of ‘the new genetics’ is the way it has been readily taken up by different groups to describe novel developments within genetic knowledge. Petersen and Bunton (2002: 36) have rightfully observed that in many cases the meaning of the new genetics is ‘left undefined by those who use it as though its meaning is transparent and generally agreed upon’. Here we want to consider the origins of the term and the different modalities of its meaning.

The origin of the term ‘new genetics’ is often attributed to David Comings (1980), editor of the American Journal of Human Genetics, who was describing a more efficient approach to identifying ‘linkage of polymorphisms to a given disorder’. In his description he provides a sense of not only a leap in ‘technical capability’ but also an immense scale of ‘departure from previous approaches’. The new genetics represents a significant step change in the production of genetic knowledge:

we now have the ironic situation of being able to jump right to the bottom line without reading the rest of the page, that is, without needing to identify the primary gene product or the basic biochemical mechanism of the disease. Since the degree of departure from our previous approaches and the potential of this procedure are so great, one will not be guilty of hyperbole in calling it the “New Genetics”. (Comings, 1980: 453)

The analogy of ‘jumping to the bottom line of the page’ describes a quantitative shift in the ability to ‘read’ information. This kind of account bears a strong resemblance to more recent descriptions of genotyping and sequencing technologies, the increasing scale of which allows scientists and professionals to raise expectations about the future of medicine. Here, Comings’ is describing a technical phenomenon that will improve ‘prenatal diagnosis’ and eventually target ‘dominant diseases’.

Weatherall, who also cites Comings’ prescient remarks, defines the new genetics using the now familiar tropes of molecule, map and promise:

Essentially, it is a change in emphasis from the analysis of human genetic disease at the clinical, cellular, and biochemical levels to the molecular level. It defines genetic disease in terms of molecular pathology. In particular, it promises to provide us with a map of the whole of the human genome which we can use to develop a highly sophisticated approach to antenatal diagnosis and to determine the molecular basis for many human diseases, the causes of which are currently unknown. Finally, in the long-term it offers us the potential for replacing defective genes. (Weatherall, 1982: 3)

This definition places a new emphasis on ‘the molecular level’ whereby human genetic disease is now defined in terms of ‘molecular pathology’. The map metaphor also provides a powerful illustration of the potential benefits of scanning molecular genetic information about ‘the human genome’. A distinguishing feature of this version of the new genetics is that mapping the human genome explicitly ‘promises’ a very broad application of benefits from medical diagnosis to understanding ‘the molecular basis of many human diseases’. The field of genetics is no longer confined to the study of rare diseases but promises a more sophisticated understanding of common diseases (see Chapter 2).

The defining features of the new genetics are the shift to a ‘molecular level’ of analysis, the efficiency of ‘procedures’ and the broader clinical applications arising from these technical developments. However, science writers were claiming the newness of molecular genetics decades earlier. For instance, we can trace further references of the ‘new genetics’ to Hamilton (1972) and Engel (1967). Since the mid-1940s, numerous scientific texts were describing ‘new’ developments within the field of molecular genetics and biology (e.g., Johnson et al. 1954, Ford and Harris 1969). When Leonard Engels’ The New Genetics was published posthumously in 1967, he seemed to be describing the shift from the ‘science of heredity’ to the ‘chemistry of heredity’. He places the origins of the new genetics at the 1940s when geneticists and biochemists were discovering specific genes functions that controlled cell chemistry. Historically, it seems that these repeated formulations of the new genetics were attempts to raise awareness about the rapid advances within the field of molecular genetics. However, by the 1980s, technical developments within the field begin to emphasise more strongly the practical consequences for preventative medicine. As laboratory science became more efficient at identifying the molecular basis of common diseases, its impact on clinical medicine became increasingly characterised by the language of promise and potential (see Chapter 5).

In the 1990s, the new genetics attracted the attention of social scientists and bioethicists who were expressing both interest and concern about the ‘social aspects’ of genetic knowledge. In reviewing the field, Richards (1993: 567) addresses a sociology audience in the hope that ‘it will both encourage geneticists to consider wider social aspects of their work and social scientists to become engaged in research related to the influence of the new genetics’. Here the language of ‘potential implications’ and ‘consequences’ are attributed to the effects of genetic knowledge upon families rather than specific individuals. Richards’ position paper explicitly outlines a research agenda ranging from family communication and kinship to the effects of genetic knowledge upon individual identity and reproductive choices. We can contrast this relatively benign account of the new genetics with the ‘menacing overtones’ found in an editorial of the first issue of New Genetics and Society:

The new genetics (including genetic engineering, the mapping of the human genome and those of other species, and their application in medicine, industry and the law) appears to directly affect us at a deeply personal level, posing a threat to the boundaries which conventionally define selfhood and distinguish humans from other animals. It generates potentially novel risks and dangers, with possible unforeseen and often unknowable or irreversible outcomes. Through these processes, it is seen by some to threaten the very basis of accepted understandings of culture and society, especially since it develops in a complex political, economic and organizational milieu. (Glasner and Rothman 1999: 5)

Here genetic knowledge is significantly broadened to include not only scientific and medical but also commercial and legal applications. The language of consequence is also more immediately imposing on the individual (‘directly affect’, ‘deeply personal’, ‘posing a threat’) suggesting that the new genetics will radically transform self and society in ways that are potentially dangerous and ‘irreversible’. The possibility of such a dystopia is conveyed by referring to other kinds of ‘processes’ which are usually backgrounded by scientists and medical professionals. In other words, a critical account of the new genetics is one that foregrounds this ‘complex … milieu’ to raise awareness and concern about the commercial exploitation of genetic knowledge. However, there is another sense in which the ‘new’ genetics is not simply a reference to the molecular revolution in the biological sciences; it is also a rhetorical strategy of distancing genetic knowledge from the old eugenics.

# Uncovering the links between neo-liberalism and the new eugenics

A number of authors have argued that the presumed distinction between the new genetics and the old eugenics is misleading. The continuation of genetic screening programmes, prenatal testing and genetic engineering suggests that there is no difference between the old eugenics and the new genetics. Authors such as Kevles (1995), Duster (1990), King (1995), and Rifkin (1998) have provocatively claimed that new genetic technologies might as well be called ‘the new eugenics’. Instead of class elimination and racial purity, the new eugenics is increasingly defined in terms of economic efficiency and quality of life. If the old eugenics was a discourse motivated by intolerance and radical social reform, the new eugenics is driven by commercial exploitation and consumer choice. The logics of the market and an ethic of self-governance have replaced the desire to improve society through state coercion.

In a critical review of the public debate, Paul (1994) argues that the promise of the new genetics also seeks to manage an ‘approved’ anxiety about the reincarnation of eugenics. This dual focus on ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ science reproduces a kind of collective fiction in which the assumptions of eugenics often remain unexplored. For instance, contemporary meanings of ‘eugenics’ are notoriously indeterminate despite their clearly nasty connotations: ‘indeed it often reveals more about its user’s attitudes than it does about the policies, practices, intentions, or consequences labeled’ (1994: 143). The source of confusion, as Paul notes, partly lies within the multiple and contradictory meanings of eugenics. Arguments that claim eugenic practices vary in terms of whether they specify intentions or effects. For instance, the practice of abortion after prenatal screening could be described as a eugenic effect, but it makes little sense to describe it as an intention: ‘Few if any women choose abortion with the aim of improving the gene pool’ (1994: 144). Some definitions are distinguished in terms of science rather than social policy while others are so broad as to be unhelpful (e.g. ‘the concern with genetic improvement of mankind’ would define all medical genetics as eugenic). Other rhetorical strategies commonly single out a powerful agent who seeks to ‘improve’, ‘promote’, ‘encourage’ or ‘interfere’ with processes on a population level. But culpability is diffused and no longer relevant when it applies to ordinary individuals making reproductive decisions; in this sense, eugenics is the ‘unintended result’ of individual choices. Paul also shows that eugenics is often characterised by contrasting coercion with individual freedom, a dualism that obscures the subtle constraints on individual choice (1994: 147–48).

Following the work of Paul and others (e.g., Nelkin 1994, Nelkin and Lindee 1995) who critically review geneticists’ accounts of eugenics in the media, Kerr et al. (1998) examine the use of rhetorical strategies by professionals in the UK. In the context of research interviews, they show how discursive practices seek to distance the new genetics from eugenics, while at the same time maintain professional authority. We consider a couple of examples from their study to give a flavour of the kind of ethical boundary work conducted by scientists and clinicians (contextual information was removed in their study for reasons of anonymity). The following respondent shows how a contrast between eugenics and the new genetics is maintained by invoking popular notions of authoritianism:

# Extract 1

As the new genetics is practiced now it is clearly not eugenic, because it’s being applied in the context of individuals’ … families’ decisions … and the other major difference is that there isn’t either government or societal interference to a huge extent, giving pressures, not in this country at any rate … but if you had a situation of widespread population screening plus an authoritarian government then I don’t think there would be any difference. That would clearly be eugenic. (Kerr et al. 1998: 183)

Here the boundary between the new genetics and eugenics is ‘clearly’ maintained by invoking the present context of individual-familial ‘decisions’, which implies freedom and capability to choose. Representations of self-government are contrasted with a kind of politically distorted bad science. The familiar imaginary of ‘authoritarian government’ combines intention and coercion to describe an alternative context in which the state intrudes upon the freedom of individuals. However, the same existing application of technology (‘widespread population screening’) can be used to describe opposing views. Consider the following extract from a different respondent:

# Extract 2

No, I think what the new genetics actually teaches you is that you’ve got to have both [nature and nurture]. I mean this is what is interesting about it, that we’ve all got the same genes and the way they show themselves and the way that happens [differs] … it’s like baking a cake. What ingredient is more important? One shapes the other continually and changes with time and it’s enormously difficult to disentangle them. Most things are actually multifactorial. And the new genetics is probably going to show that more and more, and in fact … all of us are going to be shown to have more and more of these [defective] genes. (Kerr et al. 1998: 188)

A distinct characteristic of this language is the ability to frame a balance or an interaction between biology and environment. If eugenic thinking was characterised by biological essentialism and reductionism, the new genetics is instructive in showing (‘actually teaches’) that biology responds to environmental influences. While this account retains some aspects of genetic essentialism (‘we’ve all got the same genes’), genes are also regulated by complex processes of gene expression. The mundane analogy of ‘baking a cake’ is effective in demonstrating the multiple factors implicated in the new biology, which elude any straightforward reductionism. It is worth noting, however, that the formulation ‘enormously difficult to disentangle’ does not rule out that some kind of reduction of complexity is desirable. Nevertheless, the most distinctive aspect of the new genetics is its ubiquitous application. Rather than the study of rare diseases or the targeting of particular social classes, everybody (‘all of us’) are bearers of genetic risk.

The views of scientists and clinicians that appear in Kerr et al.’s study can be contrasted with a sociological account of eugenics which, rather than focusing on coercion and intention, explores the indirect consequences of the new genetics. In Backdoor to Eugenics, Troy Duster, who writes about genetic screening of the American population, suggests that the distinction between the old and the new genetics is ‘far more subtle … because health, science and medicine are banners of the new molecular genetic technology’ (1990: 18). For him, genetic screening programmes are the reincarnation of eugenics insofar as they are unintended consequences of individual choices that occur in the guise of ‘neutral, scientific and health-beneficial’ outcomes. The availability of genetic screening services is enough to create its own demand since the choice of eliminating the ‘defective fetus’ is an implicit reason for providing such services.

According to Duster, the front end of the new genetics is moderated by the professional ideology of genetic counselling. The rhetoric of patient autonomy and individual choice figures strongly within a professional ethos of ‘neutrality’. The role of genetic counsellors as sympathetic, non-directive purveyors of information emphasises the shift towards risk communication rather than disease prevention (Kenen 1984). And while this seeks to shore up the capacity of individuals as an informed decision-makers, the very existence of genetic screening can convey the unconscious meaning that the screened-for characteristic is undesirable. Duster observes that ‘the mere existence of the new technology, and the social distribution of knowledge about its availability act together as twin pressures on a potential client’ (1990: 79). He quotes the work of Hubbard (1986) who describes the obligation to use genetic screening in Germany: ‘once a test is available and a woman decides not to use it, if her baby is born with a disability that could have been diagnosed, it is no longer an act of fate but has become her fault’ (1990: 79). This scenario illustrates the conceptual/thematic focus of our book: that autonomy – the obligation to choose in relation to preventable or calculable risks – shifts the burden of responsibility and blame to the bearer of choices and to their ability to make wise decisions.

In the context of the clinic, we can see how notions of autonomy, responsibility and blame are interlocking themes within the micropolitics of the new genetics (see Chapter 7). To demonstrate the subtle relation between these themes, let us briefly examine an empirical example. The following data is a genetic counselling session taken from Duster’s study. The data was collected in California between 1976 and 1978. In the extract below, the counsellor (C) and a couple $\mathbf { M } =$ male partner and $\mathrm { F } =$ female partner) are discussing the test procedure and risk information prior to amniocentesis. The couple are both middle-class white professionals; the woman about to undergo amniocentesis is 36 years of age:

# Extract 3

1 F: I would think that if women are going to have a baby, they ought to be able to take a shot [local anesthetic].   
2 C: [Laughs] Well, people often don’t think in those terms. But you are right, it’s fairly minor outpatient procedure. The only risk that we know can happen is that about 1 woman in 200 will have a miscarriage. The danger of miscarriage is over in four to six days. We don’t think it is elevated over what the danger is just by being pregnant at this stage, but since you have had the test, we can’t say that it would have happened anyway, because we don’t know what would have happened. That’s what you trade for the information that we can give you. At your age there is a 1-in-100 chance of

having a child with the Down Syndrome. I don’t know if you think that is big or little.

3 M: The odds of having a Down’s child is 100-to-1 and the odds of miscarrying   
200-to-1?   
4 C: Yes.   
5 F: It sounds like a very small chance to me, 1 in 100.   
6 C: When you were in your 20s, it was 1 in 1200.   
7 F: Yet, it’s much more likely than I would care to risk.   
8 C: OK, then, that’s why you have chosen to have a test.   
9 F: Yes, that’s why I did it. (Duster 1990: 142–43)

In what follows, we complement Duster’s original analysis. The counsellor plays down the seriousness of the test (‘it’s a fairly minor outpatient procedure’, ‘the only risk that we know can happen’) while presenting risk information as an objective probability ratio (‘1 woman in $2 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ , ‘1-in-100 chance’). In turn 2, C gives the floor to the couple, inviting them to comment on whether they think the risk is ‘big or small’. Simplifying the information as a descriptive binary (‘big or small’) is designed to elicit a response. The husband responds by contrasting the two risk estimates which can be heard as sense-making while also seeking clarification. The wife responds with the commonsense observation that the 1-in-100 risk estimate for Down Syndrome is ‘very small’. At this point, C could have chosen a non-directive stance by saying nothing or by exploring the couple’s feelings about the risks involved. As Duster notes, the counsellor’s response in $\tan 6$ is ‘clear and decisive’ (1990: 143). The statement: ‘When you were in your 20s, it was 1 in $1 2 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ introduces new risk information that alters the original meaning of 1-in-100 as low risk. The contrast between 1-in-100 and 1-in-1200 foregrounds the pregnant woman’s age – and hence, the immediacy of the present case – as an issue involving much higher risk. Her response in turn 7 is confirmation that she perceives the risk of miscarriage as ‘much more likely’. The subtlety of the counsellor’s response in turn 8 warrants closer examination. First, the comment ‘OK then’ rounds-off the discussion, signalling that a resolution has been reached and that no further probing is required. Second, the statement ‘that’s why you have chosen to have a test’ is an explanation, underscoring that what has transpired is a responsible action (implicitly contrasting it with the blameworthiness of those who choose not to undertake the test), and it also construes the woman’s previous turn as a ‘decision’ rather than an opportunity for further discussion. The counsellor is informing the woman that a ‘choice’ has been made. F’s reply is indication of passive agreement: ‘Yes, that’s why I did it’.

We have chosen this extract because it highlights a number of tensions associated with the new genetic technologies. It presents an early example of sociological data where the eugenic implications of prenatal testing are moderated by an ethos of self-governance and consumer choice. Facilitating autonomy is not only a safeguard against the old eugenics, it seeks to promote a form of citizenship in which autonomy and responsibility are the interactive goals of genetic counselling. In this sense, autonomy is not a natural given but an interactional accomplishment of the clinic. It presupposes a view of the individual as a rational and independent decision-maker who can logically process value-free information. But as we have seen in the extract above, the subtle framing of risk information and the rhetorical strategies used to elicit interaction are implicitly linked to what is socially valued as responsible or blameworthy conduct, the basis of which actually shape client responses as individual choices.

As suggested by Duster and others (Clarke 1991, Lippman 1992b, Shakespeare 1998, Rapp, 1999), the pressures on women to undergo genetic testing or to abort an abnormal foetus cast doubt over the capacity to make free or rational choices. The problem is that there are two conflicting versions of autonomy often surreptitiously conflated: autonomy as the right to choose and autonomy as selfreliance (e.g. Chadwick 1993). While the former is perhaps an expedient solution to the old eugenics, it does not engage in the context of how choices are shaped and performed; it cannot tell us how the locus of control for making such decisions resides not so much within the person, but within the clinic, within the horizon of expectations and the implicit demands to maintain a socio-moral order. We will return to these issues and explore the tensions and dynamics of genetic counselling more closely in Chapter 7.

# Conclusion

At the beginning of this chapter, we argued that ‘neo-liberalism’ provides an important conceptual frame in which to consider the availability of new genetic technologies. We have seen that neo-liberalism is a sociopolitical discourse that constructs a particular version of the world order based on the inevitability of global competition, the need for economies of scale, and the transformation of rights and responsibilities. Within this frame of global capitalism, individuals are obliged to be free through the calculated management of decisions and choices. An ethos of self-governance has, in many ways, replaced the language of state paternalism which figures prominently in discussions about new genetic technologies.

In the context of healthcare, we have seen that the rise of patient and consumer autonomy in Britain emerged as a solution to a wider crisis in the government of professional authorities. The problem of reforming the NHS was not the disorganisation of authority but that professional authority itself had become an obstacle to delivering an efficient and effective health service. Between the 1970s and 1990s, three broad strategies were identified as transforming techniques of governing healthcare professionals: maximising ‘economic efficiency’, installing systems of ‘accountability and autonomy’, and promoting ‘privatisation of risk management’. This historical analysis of neo-liberal reforms of healthcare illustrate the present environment in which new genetic technologies are politically and socially embedded. The rise of genetic counselling as a profession needs to be considered alongside these developments. Facilitating autonomy of the client is a solution to past abuses and forms part of the new landscape of distributed and collaborative accountability.

In revisiting the language of eugenics we have shown that ideas of heredity formed part of a political discourse of responsibility and blame within early liberal society. Notions of ‘evolution’, ‘quality’, and ‘competition’ expressed new justifications for moral reform. It makes little sense to describe the eugenics ‘movement’ in Britain as a repressive ideology. Rather, eugenics thinking was far more diffused throughout British society and far less influential on social policy. Nevertheless, the imagination of eugenics today bears all the hallmarks of bad science, brutal authoritarianism and extreme biological reductionism. The accounting strategies of professionals show how such extreme formulations of eugenics seek to rhetorically distance new genetic technologies from the old meanings of biological exclusion and elimination. The boundary between the ‘new’ genetics and the ‘old’ eugenics works to conceal the implications that new genetic technologies are used for eugenic purposes. Rather than focussing on the intentions of governments and individuals, it is possible to view eugenics as the unintended consequence of numerous individual choices made under the guise of technical neutrality and economic efficiency. Modern forms of population screening, prenatal testing and genetic engineering may indeed be subtle and indirect forms of ‘liberal eugenics’, but the goals of genetic services are framed so as to distance and moderate these claims by fostering rational self-governance.

The language of autonomy and responsibility creates new tensions regarding the practical difficulties of facilitating autonomy. These are partly issues about communication, representation and interaction as experts seek to educate publics about new genetic technologies, to impart ‘neutral’ information about risk, and to elicit rational decisions from clients. Many have expressed reservations over whether the neo-liberal project of fostering rational autonomy in the form of selfreliance is a realistic possibility, especially when risk communication is anything but neutral and when risk management is suffused with feelings of ambivalence, uncertainty and dread. Following from Chapter 4, we will explore these tensions further as they manifest in the domain of the media, the clinic and family.

# 4 Rhetorical discourse analysis

# Introduction

As outlined in Chapter 1, our interest is in understanding the various practices surrounding genetic testing, including representations of genomic knowledge, descriptions of professionals’ and clients’ everyday practice, opinions and reflections about genetic risk. Such practices cannot be separated from moral underpinnings of which autonomy, responsibility and blame play a decisive role. Our analytic focus attends to discourse at the micro-level (including not only spoken and written language but also the visual media and multimodal representations), while remaining attentive to the broader socio-historical context of discourse. We first begin with a brief overview of what is meant by discourse and the different traditions of discourse analysis. We then outline the key assumptions underpinning what we call ‘rhetorical discourse analysis’ which selectively and strategically draws upon different traditions of discourse analysis to enable us to engage with our data ranging from social interaction in clinical and research interview settings to other discourse genres such as internet advertising, media representations, and scientific writing that engages in persuasion and fact construction. One of the tasks of this chapter is to review the various discourse devices routinely used in talk and text to construct and negotiate genetic knowledge.

# Discourse and discourse analysis: an overview

Human activities and practices are mainly constituted in discourse, i.e., language use in a broad sense. In this respect, discourse is regarded as both a resource and a topic of investigation in social and human sciences (Sarangi and Coulthard 2000). Gee (2005: 27) suggests a distinction between ‘big’ and ‘little’ discourse – ‘D/discourse’:

The Discourses we enact existed before each of us came on the scene and most of them will exist long after we have left the scene. Discourses, through our words and deeds, have talked to each other through history, and, in doing so, form human history.

Big ‘Discourse’ involves a more abstract conceptualisation of the performative and constitutive role of language as exemplified by Foucauldian histories of the human and natural sciences. In this sense, ‘Discourse’ is more explicitly linked to the materiality of knowledge/power relations. The historical emergence of ‘genetic’ and ‘genomic’ knowledge can be seen in terms of a big ‘Discourse’ with socio-political, scientific-technological ramifications. However, the practices surrounding genetic testing can be examined at a micro-level to include aspects of autonomy, responsibility and blame. At a micro-level, Schiffrin (1990: 98) summarises the twofold focus of discourse – structure and function:

Discourse itself has often been viewed as both structure, i.e. a unit of language that is larger than the sentence, and as the realisation of functions, i.e. as the use of language for social, expressive, and referential purposes $[ \dots ]$ These two different definitions of discourse can lead to radically different descriptions and analyses of the same text because they define the task in such different ways.

In the early 1950s discourse analysis emerged as a disciplinary activity within linguistics. Harris’ (1952: 1) seminal article ‘Discourse analysis’ emphasised the need for an upward extension of linguistics with the claim that ‘language does not occur in stray words or sentences, but in connected discourse’:

One can approach discourse analysis from two types of problem, which turn out to be related. The first is the problem of continuing descriptive linguistics beyond the limits of a single sentence at a time. The other is the question of correlating ‘culture’ and language (i.e. non-linguistic and linguistic behaviour).

Over the last five decades, we find different traditions of discourse analysis, some more vigorously pursued than others. The different strands of discourse analysis as we recognise them today – e.g., frame analysis, narrative analysis, critical discourse analysis, conversation analysis, genre analysis, etc. – are practised with different assumptions and goals. However, despite their differential orientation to what counts as data, categorisation, unit of analysis, evidence, claim etc., at a deeper level, they do share some family resemblance with one another, given their ontological and epistemological foundations. It is possible to limit the disciplinary paradigms which underpin these tribes and sub-tribes, but not in a one-to-one relationship, namely, ethnomethodology, ethnography, phenomenology, hermeneutics, symbolic interactionism, rhetoric, literary/practical criticism, structuralism and post-structuralism.

What unites these disparate traditions of analysis is the action- and epistemologicalorientation of discourse. In other words, discourse is a practical, social activity that does things and brings about effects; it constructs knowledge and constitutes factual versions of reality. Central to our undertaking is a view of discourse as action/activity (including representation, intertextuality, coherence) and discourse as accounts (including persuasion, fact construction). Following Roberts and Sarangi (2005), there are two selective procedures for analysis: (i) identifying ‘focal themes’ for attention such as normality, responsibility, autonomy, choice, decision making, patient-centredness, professional neutrality, quality of life, risk, etc.; and (ii) mapping such focal themes to ‘discourse devices’ such as frames and footing, contextualisation cues, face and facework and other rhetorical strategies.

In the rest of this chapter we outline the basic tenets of what we call ‘rhetorical discourse analysis’ which is premised on the moral, practical and rhetorical aspects of social action. In viewing social actions as accounts, we gain access to the processes of social accountability in different contexts – professional–client encounters, research interviews with families and professionals, media representations of genetic knowledge – showing that discussions relating to genetic testing often give rise to competing versions of autonomy and different ways of claiming responsibility.

# Rhetorical discourse analysis

What distinguishes rhetorical discourse analysis from other cognate traditions is the characterisation of talk, text and other multimodal forms as accounts embedded within a sphere of social accountability. The reason for focusing on accounts and social accountability is the extraordinary range of everyday activities they cover, whether it is mending interaction, saving face, or constructing persuasive arguments. Accounts are not just something that we do with language but they are oriented to others and have a moral underpinning. In their seminal paper titled ‘Accounts’, Scott and Lyman (1968: 46) draw specific attention to the social function of language:

Our concern here is with one feature of talk: its ability to shore up the timbers of fractured sociation, its ability to throw bridges between the promised and the performed, its ability to repair the broken and restore the estranged. This feature of talk involves the giving and receiving of what we shall call accounts. (original emphasis)

Here Scott and Lyman draw attention to the social repair function of talk-in-interaction, particularly the way that actors are required to explain their own or someone else’s ‘unanticipated or untoward behaviour’.

The social role of discourse is closely related to the rhetorical organisation of descriptions: they help to ‘regulate that complex of human ambitions and frustrations that Goffman calls the ‘moral order” (Antaki 1994: 115). Indeed, it is the persuasive dimension of language-use, the construction of preferred meanings and the disagreement over descriptions that encompass the range of activities that we include under ‘accounts’. The social theory that underpins our notion of accounts is that people’s knowledge of how to act in certain occasions is not simply the product of internalising rules or a common stock of knowledge (i.e. via socialisation or cognition). Rather, people seem to experience problematic situations that routinely require negotiation. As Stokes and Hewitt (1976: 840) put it, the:

[s]ocial order is seen primarily in terms of the process of joint action: situations are defined, people mutually align their conduct, identities are created or transformed and objects and events are given meaning as they become incorporated in ongoing interaction.

By extension, accounts are part of the restorative function of ‘aligning’ actions or ‘repairing’ interactions to maintain the social order. Accounts are also forms of ‘particularisation’ whereby people may be defending or disputing the consequences arising from descriptions or categorisations (Billig 1985). In other words, accounts themselves are intrinsically rhetorical and perform both normative and problematising functions in social interaction as well as in other forms of social representation.

# Rhetorical construction of scientific knowledge

Historically, a good place to start is to show how the Anglophone version of discourse analysis developed in relation to accounting practices surrounding scientific knowledge. Gilbert and Mulkay’s (1984) classic study of scientists’ accounts revealed something both troubling and interesting about a controversy in biochemistry. The dispute was over two theoretical explanations for a complex molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Given that the leader of the prevailing theory was awarded a Nobel prize meant that this was no minor disputable. However, it occurred to Gilbert and Mulkay that they were facing a significant methodological problem. Scientists’ accounts varied in terms of those who took different sides in the debate as well as competing loyalties and allegiances. But scientists also had contrasting styles of accounts: some used formal language to describe scientific processes while others gave informal descriptions of persons and groups. More significantly, Gilbert and Mulkay found that these variations not only occurred across research interviews but also within the same interview. A further problem was that existing sociological methods had no way of dealing with these variations in any meaningful way. The legacy of realism in qualitative sociology meant that variability was treated as a distortion, a mere background ‘noise’. This tendency to privilege similarity over variability meant that analysis was constrained by theories of representation, which assumed that accounts were merely re-presentations of an underlying reality. Gilbert and Mulkay (1984: 14) acknowledge the limitations and strengths of discourse analysis as follows:

[The study of scientific discourse] does not seek to go beyond scientists’ accounts in order to describe and explain actions and beliefs as such. It focuses rather on describing how scientists’ accounts are organised to portray their actions and beliefs in contextually appropriate ways. Thus, discourse analysis does not answer traditional questions about the nature of scientific action and belief. What it may be able to do instead is to provide closely documented descriptions of the recurrent interpretative practices employed by scientists and embodied in their discourse; and show how these interpretative procedures vary in accordance with variations in social context.

Gilbert and Mulkay noticed that the variability of scientists’ accounts appeared to be organised in ways other than literal descriptions of ‘what really happened’. Drawing on Halliday’s (1978) work on the relational and contextual functions of language, they argued that the scientists’ accounts revealed the circumstances of their production; their variable descriptions were contextually grounded and strategically oriented. For instance, they showed that biochemists would use different ‘interpretive repertoires’ in research interviews to account for truth and error. They defined these repertoires as contrasting vocabularies and grammatical styles of description and explanation. The ‘empiricist repertoire’ exemplified the impersonal, method-based accounts of scientific discovery; the formal rules and procedures governing the production of factual knowledge in the public domain. The ‘contingent repertoire’ appealed to personal motives, insights, and biases whereby speculation and intuition could operate privately and informally. However, the contrast between the two repertoires was not organised in terms of formal vs. informal or public vs. private accounting practices. Rather, most of the variation occurred when accounting for error – something other than an empiricist explanation was needed to account for error. Explanations of contingency had a strategic purpose of deflecting attention to human frailties – interests, rivalries, stubbornness, ignorance, etc. – rather than criticising science itself. Gilbert and Mulkay’s ‘account’ shows that variations in the accounting of scientific error are cultural strategies that exonerate and preserve the belief in science as a respectable and rational activity. Despite its official absence from scientific publications, informal and subjective accounts are an essential part of everyday scientific practice. Keeping with the theme of scientific discourse and life sciences, Myers (1985, 1990) has focused on the social construction of scientific texts across different genres – experimental reports, review articles, proposals, popularisations and monographs. Extending the work of Latour and Woolgar (1979) and Pinch (1985) who show that high-level and low-level knowledge claims can be arranged within a hierarchy of ‘modalisation’ (i.e. degrees of facticity) or ‘externality’ (degrees of out-there-ness),1 Myers shows that a similar hierarchy can be arranged in terms of ‘the distance between the author’s claims and the claims of the particular part of the scientific literature in which they are to be placed’ (1985: 602). The process of writing and revision of scientific articles is one of negotiation that preserves the homogeneity of the scientific literature – this negotiation ‘has an important consensusbuilding function’ (1985: 627). He goes on to argue that separating scientific discourse into repertoires is a ‘cumbersome analytical tool’, preferring instead to focus on ‘the generation or reception of the text’ (Myers 1990: 29). His own style of rhetorical analysis is not concerned with exposing ideology or unmasking rhetoric, but tracing the production of scientific knowledge as a social process.

# Accounts as argumentative strategies: bridging actions and attitudes

The rhetorical analysis of the social construction of scientific knowledge was an early precursor to its uptake in other areas of the social sciences. Before taking up a firm position within ‘discourse analysis’, the study of rhetoric needed respecification based not on principles of formal logic and argumentation, but ordinary explanations. Traditional studies of rhetoric would usually dissect ordinary explanations to reveal an underlying structure of rational thought. The reappearance of rhetoric as part of the linguistic turn, however, focused on the persuasive dimension of language-use (Nelson et al. 1987, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca 1969, Simons 1989). The work of Billig (1985, 1996) has had a significant impact on this renewed interest in rhetoric. In Arguing and Thinking (1996), Billig proposes that rhetoric should not be confined to argumentative or persuasive communication but seen as a pervasive social activity in which various forms of commonsense such as proverbs, idioms, clichés, etc. are essentially contradictory. Drawing on Protagoras’ maxim that every position in an argument is necessarily two-sided, Billig builds a case that human thinking and speaking is essentially argumentative: to hold an opinion or to assert an argument is to implicitly acknowledge and counter an alternative viewpoint.

This relational/oppositional image of thought mounts a serious challenge to the belief that people’s actions are caused by mental events such as ‘attitudes’. In social psychological research, attitudes are essentially statistical correlations of thoughts and actions, which imply a long-standing belief about consistency: that attitudes are an underlying cause of consistency in human conduct. The problem with psychological theories of consistency, according to Billig, is that ‘inconsistency’ – or ‘variation’ in the sense of Gilbert and Mulkay – is treated as a delay or interruption in the process of assigning an attitude. Inconsistencies are contradictions that await or resist categorisation. In social psychology, it is widely acknowledged that attitudes are poor predictors of action. However, Billig argues that ‘accounts’ exemplify the kind of activities where arguments are provided to explain the inconsistency between attitudes and actions. To give an account of oneself is not to prevent controversy but to actively engage in controversy through a strategy of ‘particularisation’. These are arguments that justify the separation between an action and a general category by persuading others that the inconsistency should be categorised differently.

We can admit that a particular sort of action runs counter to our attitudes, but, for reasons which must be given, we argue that the present act is very different: its essence suggests that it should not be categorized under the forbidding attitude, but it should be classed very differently. (1996: 213)

Here, the emphasis is on characterising ‘particulars’ that do not fit general categories, where much of the activity of accounting is about contesting categories. From a rhetorical perspective, Billig suggests that accounts are argumentative strategies that persuade, defend, and dispute the meaning and consequences of categorisation.

Billig’s reassessment of rhetoric raises important implications for the study of discourse. The argumentative nature of discourse seems to challenge the normative foundation of the ‘interaction order’ (Goffman 1983). Goffman’s (1971)

studies of remedial action and the repair function of accounts, for example, over-emphasise consensus by treating contradictions as departures rather than regular activities of social interaction. For Billig, everyday reasoning is rhetorically organised: ‘we cannot understand the meaning of a piece of reasoned discourse, unless we know what counter positions are being implicitly or explicitly rejected’ (Billig 1991: 44). This requires a shift from analyses that privilege social order to one that can explicate the rhetorical and social organization of ideology and power (Billig 1991). While approaches such as conversation analysis (CA) are useful inasmuch as they analyse the construction of participants’ understandings in their own terms, they ‘convey an essentially non-critical view of the social world … implicitly depicted as a world of equality and participation in which ‘members’ share systems of social order’ (Billig 1999: 552). Asymmetries in power and advantage are material relations that structure and perpetuate particular forms of social organization. They are, according to Billig, ‘intrinsically rhetorical’, and provide many rich resources for argumentation.

# Accounting for accounts

The idea that accounts are activities in which we are somehow ‘accountable’ to others for our actions/behaviours (Garfinkel 1956) needs further elaboration. Primarily, accounts are ‘descriptions’, ‘ordinary explanations’ or ‘self-reports’ about everyday activities (Antaki 1988). More specifically, accounts can also be viewed as ‘the use of language to interactionally construct preferred meanings for problematic events’ (Buttny 1993: 21). Drawing upon Goffman’s (1959) notion of self-presentation, Scott and Lyman (1968: 46) see an account as ‘a linguistic device employed whenever an action is subjected to evaluative inquiry’ – ‘a statement made by a social actor to explain unanticipated or untoward behaviour’. Beyond individual actions, accounts reflect culturally embedded normative explanations. Following Goffman’s (1981) extensive work on repair, excuses and justifications are the kinds of accounts we give in ‘times of trouble’, usually when someone has committed an offence or if they face an accusation. Scott and Lyman develop their notion of accounts from three intellectual trajectories.

One line of development coming from rhetoric, philosophy and sociology was the work on ‘motives’. In contrast to the psychological view that language is the expression of prior elements within the individual, Mills (1940) argued that human motivation is something to be described and explained in the course of situated social consequences. Drawing on Burke (1936), he argued that motives ‘are imputed or avowed as answers to questions interrupting acts or programs … They stand for anticipated situational consequences of questioned conduct’ (1940: 905). This laid the foundations for a research programme that would later explore the kinds of reasons people give for their actions or, more subtly, the reasons they give for anticipated consequences. In this sense, motives are ‘accepted justifications for present, future, or past programs or acts’ (1940: 907). This goes beyond viewing accounts as occasioned by problematic, untoward events and behaviour.

Sykes and Matza (1957) also explored the justificatory nature of people’s explanations in their theory of delinquency. What they called ‘techniques of neutralisation’ referred to the various kinds of rationalisation offered by delinquents as ‘definitions favourable to the violation of law’, to borrow a phrase from Sutherland (1955). Various kinds of ‘denials’, ‘pleas’ and ‘appeals’ served the justificatory function of ‘protecting the individual from self-blame and the blame of others after the act’, but they also ‘precede deviant behaviour and make deviant behaviour possible’ (1957: 666). Thus to become a member of that sub-culture, delinquents behave in ways that are justified according to criteria different from that of the dominant culture (Becker 1963).2 An interesting aspect of their theory is that justifications are not merely post hoc explanations of past actions but are constitutive of future actions, such as delinquency.

Another parallel development was Goffman’s work on ‘embarrassment’ (1956), ‘self-presentation’ (1959), ‘corrective process’ (1967) and ‘remedial interchanges’ (1971). A common thread running through Goffman’s micro-studies of transient and ritual encounters is the maintenance of orderly interaction and the protection of selves. The presentation of self is a basic organising principle of social interaction – individuals project a version of self that emulates or upholds the norms and competencies of a given society. However, when problematic events occur that give rise to embarrassment, criticism or offence, then ‘remedial work’ is required. According to Goffman (1971), the three most basic remedial strategies are ‘accounts’, ‘apologies’ and ‘requests’.3 More generally, social interaction is structured by rules protective of one’s own ‘face’ or the face of others. As Buttny (1993) observes, accounts are ways of saving face when the ceremonial order of face-to-face interaction becomes disrupted. Thus, a strong feature of Goffman’s study of interactional repair is ‘exoneration’, which does not equate with individual action or ego defence but ‘orchestrated ensemble performances … which fills in the breach and moves the interactional sequence back onto firmer ground’ (Antaki 1994: 45).

Scott and Lyman’s formulation of accounts was also influenced by ethnomethodology (Garfinkel 1967). According to Garfinkel, ‘the activities whereby members produce and manage settings of organised everyday affairs are identical with members’ procedures for making those settings “account-able”’ (1967: 1). By ‘account-able’ Garfinkel means that actions and descriptions are produced and oriented to by participants as mutually recognisable and intelligible within a factual and moral order (Heritage 1984). Rather than an external cause that governs human action from a distance, the factual and moral order is one that is continuously produced and maintained in the course of interactional and situational contexts. People ‘account’ for themselves when they want others to recognise and understand what they are doing. In this wide sense of the term accounts are conceived as sense-making practices. But they can also be understood as forms of repair when commonsense or normative rules are disrupted, as Goffman argued. Garfinkel’s (1963) famous breaching experiments demonstrate that when people challenge conventional understandings or act ‘out of place’, an account is usually required (or even demanded) to restore order. What makes an account recognisable is what Garfinkel calls ‘background expectancy’ – the inferential and taken-for-granted knowledge that permits individuals to understand an account when one is given. Consider the following example in which a man (B) has called a helpline to report ‘some marital troubles’ (Sacks 1992: 411):

Example 1: [A $=$ Counsellor; B = Male Caller]

1 A: Yeah, then what happened?   
2 B: Okay, in the meantime she [wife of B] says, “Don’t ask the child nothing.” Well, she stepped between me and the child, and I got up to walk out the door. When she stepped between me and the child, I went to move her out of the way. And then about that time her sister called the police. I don’t know how she … what she …   
3 A: Didn’t you smack her one?   
4 B: No.   
5 A: You are not telling me the story, Mr B.   
6 B: Well, you see when you say smack you mean hit.   
7 A: Yeah, you shoved her. Is that it?   
8 B: Yeah, I shoved her.

What is immediately striking is how A was capable of recognising that there was more to B’s story than he was saying. B’s account of walk-out-the-door is evidently disputable, partly because the description is produced to counter an alternative scenario, but also because certain inferences or ‘cultural expectations’ can be made about why the wife’s sister ‘called the police’. It is on the basis of such inferences about domestic violence and the defensiveness of B’s descriptions that A successfully challenges the adequacy of ‘I went to move her out of the way’. The fact that people’s descriptions attend to so many things – constructing factual events, implicating motives and intentions, assigning responsibility and blame, offering or countering alternatives, managing credibility – indicates that accounts are ‘designed’ with reference to how it will be recognised and understood by others (Heritage 1984). The example above clearly demonstrates that accounts are interactionally designed to construct preferred meanings for problematic events. Returning to Scott and Lyman (1968) we can see that their own formulation of accounts is rather narrowly conceived in terms of managing these problematic events.

# Excuses and justifications

Scott and Lyman (1968) propose a classic distinction between excuses and justifications that are constitutive of accounts. For them, justifications are ‘accounts in which one accepts responsibility for the act in question, but denies the pejorative quality associated with it’; excuses are ‘accounts in which one admits that the act in question is bad, wrong, or inappropriate but denies full responsibility’ (1968: 47). Scott and Lyman’s idea of formulating a split between excuses and justifications can be traced to the linguistic philosopher, John Austin. In ‘A Plea for Excuses’, Austin (1961) distinguishes excuses from justifications as different kinds of defences for ‘untoward’ conduct. This distinction, he argues, does not hold purely for conceptual or definitional reasons but in terms of ordinary language use.4 While Austin seems to be interested in foregrounding aspects of action and context to distinguish conceptually similar meanings, Scott and Lyman are more concerned with shoring up definitional rules for enforcing this distinction.

Reconsidering Scott and Lyman’s work, we can see that they were more concerned with differentiating excuses and justifications as constitutive of accounts independent of their situational or interactional context. As Antaki (1994) notes, this ‘puzzling restriction’ has meant that only exonerations achieved by explanation are considered, excluding most of Goffman’s work on repair. It also excludes a wider range of accounts as everyday descriptions and sensing-making practices, which do not fall neatly into either justification or excuse.

Whether the proposed distinction is watertight is dependent on interactional circumstances rather than hard and fast rules. In interaction, a justification proffered by one participant may be considered an excuse by the co-participant. Nevertheless, the central concern of accounts appears to be the evaluation of human conduct in terms of responsibility (cf. Austin 1961, Goffman 1971, Buttny 1993). For instance, excuses are understood as accounts that offer explanations about the conditions of an offensive action which can mitigate the actor’s responsibility, while justifications are accounts where responsibility is accepted but the characterisation of the incident is challenged.

In their critical review of the accounts literature, Semin and Manstead (1983) take up the problem with this taxonomic approach. In the 15-year period since the original Scott and Lyman publication, the list of subtypes of excuses and justifications had grown significantly (see Hewitt and Stokes 1975, Schönbach 1980, Tedesche and Reiss 1981). As Antaki (1994) observes, the accounts literature appeared to be drifting from its original emphasis on situated actions and becoming instead an abstract enterprise. Despite various attempts to prune and reorganise the categories, Semin and Manstead appear to do the best job of keeping the categories faithful to Austin’s original distinction and, more importantly, redirecting the field back to sequences of action. They suggest that more research was needed to consider naturalistic data and to examine the relations between the offense and the account.

In a similar vein, Buttny (1993) argues that much of the research glosses how accounts are actually produced: ‘typically it is assumed that one is merely reacting to an accusation, rather than actively construing and formulating the problematic to use in producing an account’ (1993: 32). In his own work, Buttny combines ethnomethodology (Garfinkel 1967) and conversation analysis (Sacks et al. 1974) with social constructionism (Gergen 1982, Shotter 1985, Harré 1986) to develop what he calls a ‘conversation analytic constructionist approach’. Accounts are analysed by attending to: (i) how the prior construction of blame creates the ‘conditional relevancies’ for an account as a response; and (ii) how people actively describe ‘relevant aspects of the prior problematic event’ to produce their account (1993: 51). The first attends to the sequential organization of accounts as talk, while the second addresses accounts as a discursive practice.

Antaki (1994) also turns to conversation analysis to treat accounts as a situated, ongoing activity. He draws on the work of Atkinson and Drew (1979) and Cody and McLaughlin (1988) to show how exonerations are actually managed in courtroom proceedings. These context-enriched analyses show that accounts are not reducible to a single speech act but are often ‘doing a cocktail of different things at once’ (1994: 62). Identifying the account depends on knowing its place within the sequential organization of interaction. Antaki concludes that we cannot do away with the taxonomic approach since it provides ‘a rough approximation of the kinds of things one will encounter’ (1994: 67).

Having stressed the central role of accounts vis-à-vis everyday human conduct, in the remainder of the chapter we examine the ‘three pillars’ on which Rhetorical Discourse Analysis stands – ‘categorisation’, ‘modalisation’, ‘intertextuality/ interdiscursivity’ – after which we consider the various ‘rhetorical devices’ routinely used in accounting practices. First, we turn our attention to the role of categorisation in accounts.

# Accounts as categorisation work

Categorisation has long been considered a fundamental activity of human thought. The dominant realist view describes it as a private, mental process of grouping and sorting objects according to similar properties; language is relegated to a banal process of naming. Following the controversial hypothesis of Sapir and Whorf in the 1920s, the realist formula was turned on its head by suggesting that categories are the product of language use. Further work exploring the social nature of categorisation was developed by Schutz (1964), Garfinkel (1967) and Cicourel (1974). In linguistics, categorisation has been associated with practices of description (Hodge and Kress 1993, Lakoff, 1987), while a constructionist perspective argues that any form of description involves categorisation in that persons, groups, objects or events are said to be constituted through categorisation. Similarly, social representation theory claims that categorisation is a process of ascribing meaning to new phenomena (Moscovici, 1961). However, categorisation is more than just descriptions of the world; they are also resources with which speakers perform discursive actions (Edwards 1997, see also Billig’s notion of ‘particularisation’ as discussed earlier).

Sacks’ (1992) notions of ‘membership category’ and ‘membership categorisation devices’ are examples of how categories are associated with attributes, activities and obligations. Following the rules of economy and consistency, categories are routinely applied by members of society for the classification of persons. For example, ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘son’, ‘grandmother’, etc. are said to belong to the membership categorisation device ‘family’. Membership categories are not only activities and obligations in their own right, they also serve an inferential function – they enable people to judge what is going on in everyday interactions. Sacks’ (1974) classic example – ‘The baby cried. The mommy picked it up’ – appeals to the hearer’s maxim that the ‘baby’ and the ‘mommy’ belong to the category of ‘family’: ‘if two or more categories are used to categorise two or more members of some population, and those categories can be heard as categories from the same collection, then: hear them that way’ (Sacks 1974: 219–20).

Categories are often constructed and negotiated in subtle ways rather than directly formulated. For example, Watson (1978) has shown how speakers calling a helpline imply entitlements or obligations on the basis of their membership to certain categories such as class, race and religion. Blame can be allocated where such entitlements and obligations are not fulfilled or by transforming membership categories into devices in their own right. For example, inferences about the conduct or attributes of ‘welfare recipients’ can be used to imply laziness or undeservingness. Smith (1978) has also shown in her classic paper, ‘K is mentally ill’, how constructions of mental illness are subtly implied by contrasting the deviant behaviour of the target (‘K’) with the apparently normal behaviour of the narrator. Other researchers have employed membership categorisation in a variety of everyday settings to show that more than forms of characterisation and description, ‘category-bound’ activities are complex affairs involving social sorting, rights and obligations as well as the negotiation of identities and resources (Cuff 1980, Jayyusi 1984, Silverman 1987, Hester and Eglin 1997, Antaki and Widdicombe 1998, Housley 2000).

In the context of genetic testing, category-bound activities can impute irresponsibility of family members. In the following example, descriptions of the cousin’s ‘odd’ behaviour appear to warrant moral categorisation:

Example 2: [R $=$ Researcher; M = Mother]

1 R: but there seems to be a kind of issue about responsibility   
$2 \ \mathrm { ~ M } .$ : yeah   
3 R: about knowing before?   
$4  { \mathrm { ~ \textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }  { \mathrm { M } }$ : it’s not like gran said (.) if she didn’t know before then if she’d gone ahead and got pregnant then that’s okay you know we wouldn’t have gone on at her (.) that was her decision but then to get pregnant and then go and have the test done to see if there’s fragile X then she knew this before she started to (.) decided to start a family (.) she wasn’t pregnant (.) told members of the family it just seemed an odd thing to do   
5 R: has she explained why she did it in that order if you like?   
6 M: no she’s not (.) she’s the sort of person who is ignorant of things

Both R and M are jointly constructing an explanation for why the cousin chose to have testing after she fell pregnant when she knew that Fragile X was ‘in the family’. Notice how M establishes a period ‘before’ the pregnancy to suggest that she knew about the inheritable risk before she ‘decided to start a family’. Establishing intentionality allows M to frame the cousin’s behaviour as ‘odd’. The success of the attribution is confirmed by R’s question in the next turn. The cousin’s lack of accountability, i.e., not offering an explanation for the peculiar ‘order’ of events, warrants the category of ignorance. The construction, argumentation and negotiation of categories are therefore important aspects of managing and attributing accountability in everyday settings.

Another form of categorisation is where certain elements are selected to be foregrounded while others are backgrounded, thus providing a basis for how what is said is to be interpreted. We refer to this as the figure-ground relations (Duranti and Goodwin, 1992) of an account in context. Originally developed from phenomenology and Gestalt psychology, the figure-ground relational trope was later incorporated into narrative analysis (Labov and Waletzky 1967) and linguistics (Wallace 1982, Reinhart 1984). Labov (1972), for instance, observed that certain grammatical forms tend to relegate descriptions to a static background, while other grammatical forms tend to ‘foreground’ the action of the narrative, which is construed as the perceptual figure. Rather than emphasising the narrator’s choice of perspective and/or event construction as simply referential devices, we want to adapt the figure/ground distinction as a rhetorical act drawing attention to the position taking of the participant (Harré and Langenhove 1999). Figure-ground relations are a useful apparatus for understanding how participants foreground characters and events to justify claims of responsibility while positioning themselves as acting appropriately within a socio-moral order.

For the purposes of our analysis, we also take an interest in ‘categorisation work’ in professional settings (cf. Hall et al. 2006). This refers to ‘the process of negotiating professional categories on occasions specifically organised to categorise people, relationships and situations’ (2006: 29). These are occasions where professional categories are both a feature and an anticipated outcome of institutional interactions. How do parents negotiate or resist attempts by professionals to employ the category of ‘the child’ to defer childhood genetic testing? How do clients resist professional frames of interaction by normalising genetic ‘risk’? How are obligations to ‘communicate’ or ‘disclose’ risk information to other relatives negotiated or resisted? In the next section, we consider the role of modalisation in the strategic accounting of facticity and commitment.

# Modalisation

Closely related to ‘category work’ is modalisation. According to Halliday, modality is ‘the speaker’s judgement of the probabilities, or the obligations, involved in what he is saying’ (1985: 75). In any propositional utterance, the producer must indicate a degree of ‘affinity’ with the proposition (Hodge and Kress 1988), which is often realised by differences of ‘commitment’ (Hacking 1990, Fairclough 2003). As Toulmin observes:

Our probability-terms come to serve as, therefore, not only to qualify assertions, promises and evaluations themselves, but also as an indication of the strength of the backing which we have for the assertion, evaluation or whatever. It is the quality of the evidence or argument at the speaker’s disposal which determines what sort of qualifier he is entitled to include in his statements:

whether he ought to say, ‘This must be the case’, ‘This may be the case’, or ‘This cannot be the case’: whether to say ‘Certainly so-and-so’, ‘Probably so-and-so’ or ‘Possibly so-and-so’. (Toulmin 1958: 90)

Modalisation has important consequences for the construction of facticity; for example, the proposition ‘the Earth is flat’ is significantly transformed by adding the modal adverb: ‘the Earth is probably/possibly/obviously flat’. Modal verbs are common forms of modalisation (‘can, will, may, must, would, should’, etc.); however, Hodge and Kress (1988) have identified many different species of modality. They include ‘hedges’ such as ‘sort of’, ‘kind of’ (e.g. ‘the Earth is kind of round’). The speaker’s commitment can also be modulated by intonation and oral delivery – whether the speaker’s tone or delivery is hesitant, confident, tentative or assertive. Other ways of differentiating commitment are through the use of subjectively marked modalities such as ‘I think the Earth is flat’ or strengthening truth claims by using a mental process such as ‘I strongly believe the earth is flat’.

Another kind of modalisation explicitly marked as a rhetorical device is what Pomerantz (1986) calls ‘extreme case’ formulation. This refers to a common descriptive practice that involves making extreme points to bolster and legitimise the speaker’s claim. Here is an example of how it is used as part of justification on the part of a mother (M) for not disclosing genetic risk within the family:

# Example 3:

M: so I just think it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie that’s the way I see it but no my mother would love it she really wants it $( \spadesuit )$ and I’ve said no (.) no

M has just explained that further genetic testing in the family might expose her father’s questionable paternity (earlier in the interview she states ‘my dad was a bit of a mix’). She believes the test results would expose to the family the grandmother’s presumed infidelity. On these grounds she uses the proverbial metaphor ‘it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie’; its formulation as an extreme case (‘best’) asserts that no possible good can come from exposing the family’s genetic history, but this assertion is qualified by ‘I just think’. This is contrasted with modalising the mother’s perspective who ‘really wants’ the disclosure to get back at her mother-in-law.

Pomerantz (1986) identifies three kinds of extreme case formulations for analysis: (i) countering challenges to the legitimacy of complaints, accusations, justifications and defences; (ii) proposing a phenomenon as objective rather than the product of circumstance; (iii) proposing the validity or praiseworthiness of behaviour by virtue of its frequency or commonality. One way of enhancing the legitimacy of a complaint is to present it as the strongest case (‘all day’, ‘all the time’). In order to justify a course of action the speaker may want to portray the precipitating circumstances as an extreme case that warranted action (‘every time’, ‘no one’, ‘the worst’). When neutralising or deflecting responsibility speakers may invoke the frequency of behaviour as an extreme case (‘everyone’, ‘all’) to establish its normality. Pomerantz draws on Garfinkel’s (1967) assertion that the social order is fundamentally a moral order, in which case speakers formulate extreme cases to establish what is acceptable and right. We now turn to the third pillar on which Rhetorical Discourse Analysis rests: intertextuality/interdiscursivity.

# Intertextuality/interdiscursivity

The rhetorical organization of accounts cuts across public/private and commercial/ governmental domains of discourse practice. Accounts are not just restricted to situated social interaction, but they also appear on websites, in documentaries or advertisements, by mixing different discourse practices. Indeed, the presence of other texts within a text or prior talk in ongoing talk is an important feature of how the new genetics is communicated and promoted in contemporary society.

Fairclough (1992) argues that the work of Bakhtin, Kristeva, and Foucault have all made important contributions to the development of discourse practices as an intertextual phenomenon within and across institutions and societies. A less abstract way of putting this is to underscore the ‘dialogicality’ of text in a broader sense. Bakhtin (1981), for example, suggests that texts (whether they be a conversation, a scientific paper, or a novel) are oriented retrospectively in response ‘to’, or oriented prospectively to anticipate a response ‘from’, other texts. Texts are therefore dialogical and polyvocal, containing many elements of other texts or ‘voices’ which can be used for accounting purposes. A good example of the intertextual/dialogical organization of text is the use of ‘reported speech’. Encoding the voice of others in an account can be a persuasive way of representing what-was-actually-said, especially when reconstructing problematic events. For example, when a genetic counsellor in the research interview says ‘And the parents said to me ‘‘we want HD testing done,” ’ we know that the parent’s request anticipates a problem or dilemma about childhood testing; it also anticipates an account of how that dilemma was resolved by the professional. Hall et al. (1999b), in the social work context of child neglect, demonstrate how reported speech can be deployed strategically to endorse institutionally sanctioned actions. Here, the decision of testing is attributed to the parents via the reported speech. But there is always an ambivalence about this kind of intertextuality in accounts: we can never be sure, as Fairclough puts it, ‘whether the actual wording is attributable to the person whose speech is represented’ (1992: 105).

According to Fairclough, critical discourse analysis (CDA) seeks to show how the concept of intertextuality points to the productivity of texts. However, this productivity is not ‘a limitless space for textual innovation and play’, but limited and constrained by relations of power: ‘The theory of intertextuality cannot itself account for these social limitations, so it needs to be combined with a theory of power relations and how they shape and are shaped by social structures and practices’ (1992: 103). A distinctive feature of Fairclough’s analytic approach is making intertextuality explicit to the reader by exposing the power relations implicated in its production. For example, he distinguishes between ‘manifest’ and ‘constitutive’ intertextuality to describe how a given text may incorporate other texts either explicitly or implicitly. Intertexuality is said to be ‘manifest’ when different texts are marked or cued by the surface features of the text (i.e., reported speech, presupposition, negation, metadiscourse, and irony). By contrast, intertextuality is ‘constitutive’ when other texts are incorporated without being explicitly cued. Fairclough uses a different label, interdiscursivity, to refer to ‘constitutive intertextuality’. One of the aims of CDA is to make the heterogeneity of texts explicit to the reader in order to reveal its preferences, values and ideological assumptions. While interdiscursivity distinguishes implicit elements and combinations of discourse, for us intertextuality is more relevant to our focus on Rhetorical Discourse Analysis. For us, intertextuality is a form of re-categorisation, with elements of modalisation.

# Rhetorical devices

What we call ‘rhetorical devices’ are the building blocks of rhetorical discourse analysis. Roberts and Sarangi (2005) refer to these devices as ‘analytic themes’ which may include, for example, frames and footing, contextualisation cues and inferences, face and facework, and other linguistic features such as contrast, constructed dialogue, repetition, lists, metaphor, pronoun, analogy, extreme case formulation, character and event work, etc. In what follows we elaborate (with illustrative examples) some of these devices that are directly relevant for our purposes (for further details, see Roberts and Sarangi 2005).

# Character work

Developed from literary theory (Chatman 1978, Rimmon-Kenan 1983) and narrative analysis (Labov and Waletzky 1967), techniques of characterisation are important and pervasive aspects of description. For instance, it is common for professionals to depict people as self-standing, autonomous agents acting on the basis of internal desires and motivations. Such descriptions serve the rhetorical move of dealing with accountability, especially in problematic scenarios. Dingwall et al. (1983) consider the importance of assessing the moral character of parents in the context of professional decision-making about child abuse cases, while Silverman (1987) attends to the sensitivity of character work in consultations between doctors and parents in out-patient clinics for adolescent diabetes. Character work provides justification for professional intervention, and can have a major bearing on how cases are handled. However, character work is not confined to professional ways of seeing. Family members characterise children, siblings, parents, etc. as part of their accounting practices in allocating blame/responsibility.

Let us consider an example where a genetic counsellor (GC) is describing a ‘difficult case’ involving a father who was demanding genetic testing for his two children:

Example 4: $[ \mathrm { G C } =$ Genetic Counsellor]

GC: [ … ] and the father is adamant that these two children should be tested, have carrier testing performed (.) and in that he’s a very aggressive pushy, difficult man and who’s- and what he’s done is (.) he’s in an extreme state of anxiety himself (.) mainly because someone said no-not (.) they haven’t said no to him (.) we’ve just said (.) well you know (.) how about the principles of this thing?

It is worth noting that character work appears at the beginning of GC’s account. Describing the father as ‘adamant’, ‘aggressive’, ‘pushy’, ‘difficult’, etc. is a way of framing the father, which subsequently influences the range of inferences that can be drawn from the remainder of the account. The father’s conduct is furthermore explained in terms of his ‘extreme state of anxiety’, implying that non-compliance with ethical protocols is irrational. Categorising parental requests for childhood testing as irrational are ways of justifying professional guidelines that aim to protect the autonomy of minors.

# Event work

Just as methods of foregrounding character are effective in managing accountability, so too are methods of describing events (Labov and Waletzky 1967, Reissman 1993). Pomerantz (1978) has shown that attribution of responsibility is often occasioned by reporting an ‘unhappy incident’. In everyday explanations, the temporal ordering of events allows speakers to allocate responsibility via antecedent actions of the blameworthy target. Edwards (1994) argues that ‘script formulations’ can achieve the opposite: ‘to make [ways of formulating actions] perfectly normal, what everybody or anybody would do, as routine, not needing any special account’ (1994: 217). Script formulation employs contrast structures or generalisations of specific actions to normalise events. However, Edwards shows that they can be used rhetorically to pathologise as well. In Smith’s (1978) “K is mentally ill”, script formulations are pervasively used to contrast what others do as routine and normal with what K does as exceptional and abnormal: ‘K was unable to put on a teapot cover correctly, she would not reverse its position to make it fit, but would simply keep slamming it down on the pot’ (1978: 46).

In the context of childhood genetic testing, Sarangi and Clarke (2002a) have demonstrated how the categorisation of events can be used strategically to contrast the parent’s right to know with the child’s present and past life events. This strategy of categorising events in terms of what is in the best interests of the child versus the parents’ rights is common in social work (Hall et al. 1997). In the following example, a paediatrician $( \mathrm { P } )$ is narrating a case in which a father has insisted that all three of his children be tested for adrenal hyperplasia (hirsutism). One way of subtly undermining the father’s request is to imply that the testing is ‘unnecessary’:

# Example 5: $[ \mathrm { P } =$ Paediatrician]

P: it’s very mild in the form that he [the eldest boy] has it $[ \dots ]$ but there are probably thousands-well (.) there are certainly thousands of women walking around with it who don’t know they have it (.) and you don’t need to treat it usually (.) there’s a very high incidence of it in [country] (.) and they quite aggressively treat it in [country] (.) we don’t in this country (.) anyway so he wanted treatment.

Event work or script formulation establishes that the genetic condition is common (‘thousands of women walking around with it’) and remains virtually undetected. $\mathrm { P }$ is setting up a subtle contrast between two scenarios: the testing practices in the country where the family normally live and the testing practices in the UK. Given that the eldest boy’s condition is ‘very mild’ and that UK practitioners do not usually treat the condition (let alone test children), $\mathrm { P }$ categorises this case as an example of unnecessary testing of children.

# Framing and footing

The notion of frame is borrowed from Goffman (1974) who refers to it as the ‘schemata of interpretation’ or ‘definition of the situation’ by means of conceptual or linguistic criteria that organise our meaning and perception of events. Frames enable members of a culture to identify and locate phenomena in ways that are socially organised and individually meaningful. They also operate at a metalevel to signal how particular sequences of interactions should be interpreted and therefore function at a different level to the kind of categorisation work we have examined so far. Frames are themselves examples of categories that organise and structure segments of interaction, which can include position taking or perspective taking. In the context of genetic testing, we can identify competing frames: child’s best interest frame, parental rights to know frame, child’s future autonomy frame, etc. Frames are often realised by shifts in ‘footing’. This is another term employed by Goffman to describe:

a change in the alignment we take up to ourselves and the others present as expressed in the way we manage the production or reception of an utterance. A change in our footing is another way of talking about a change in our frame for events. (Goffman 1974: 5)

In the context of genetic counselling, we find regular shifts in footing as the content and implications of genetic knowledge are exchanged and negotiated in the course of clinical interactions. Counsellors often initiate a shift in footing to offer genetic explanations, to elicit information about family pedigrees and to initiate ‘reflective frames’ (Sarangi 2000; Sarangi et al. 2003, 2004). Initiation of reflective frames are signalled when ‘counsellors move into the interactional role of active listener and relinquish the primary speaker slot to clients, inviting the latter to reflect on the decision-making process’ (Sarangi et al. 2004: 137). As a discourse strategy, reflective frames are ways of exploring the psychosocial or relational dimension of decision making and are similar to the therapeutic talk in psychotherapy. The following example demonstrates the difficulty of initiating a reflective frame in the context of predictive testing for Huntington’s Disease.

Example 6: [GC $=$ Genetic Counsellor; $\mathrm { A F = }$ Affected Female; MP $=$ Male Partner]

1 GC: how have you been?   
2 AF: okay? …   
3 GC: okay okay or sort of-(^^^^^^^^)?   
4 AF: no I’ve been okay (fine)   
5 GC: is it ((having the test)) something that (.) you’ve chatted about just since   
we last met?   
6 AF: (.) [no]   
7 MP: [not (really)]   
8 GC: right

This is the last meeting before the giving of the result. Here the counsellor (GC) is attempting to initiate the reflective frame with a woman in her early twenties (AF) who attends the clinic with her partner (MP) and her mother-in-law. In the first turn, ‘how have you been?’ is interpreted as a conventional greeting rather than as an inquiry into AF’s emotional well-being. The counsellor initiates a more indirect attempt of framing the interaction in terms of whether ‘it’ (the practical/ emotional implications of a positive test result) has been a topic of conversation. As we can see, the counsellor has to work hard, interactionally speaking, to encourage clients to offer a display of their understanding.

# Metaphor

Metaphors are pervasive forms of cultural and social framing which are particularly relevant to issues of facticity and categorisation. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) conceive a fluid relationship between cultural and ordinary aspects of language use. They argue that ‘human thought processes are largely metaphorical’ (1980: 6) and develop the idea of ‘conceptual metaphors’ as culturally derived structures that organise everyday activities and experience. Take, for example, the metaphorical concept ‘time is money’. In contemporary English language there is a staggering variety of ways in which time is expressed as a valuable commodity:

# Example 7:

I don’t have the time to give you   
How do you spend your time these days   
I’ve invested a lot of time in her   
You’re running out of time   
Do you have much time left   
Thank you for your time (Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 8).

Lakoff and Johnson argue that such expressions are a reflection of how the concept of work has been organised in modern Western culture whereby the value of work is measured hourly, weekly, monthly or annually. The concept of time is understood and experienced as a ‘thing’ that can be bought, sold, invested or wasted. Metaphorical concepts are thus cultural frames that provide systematicity and coherence to cultural values. In fact, the more deeply entrenched these values, the more likely that they will conform to a coherent metaphorical system (e.g. ‘time is money’, ‘more is up’, ‘bigger is better’). The metaphorical uses of language are so historically and culturally pervasive that they often acquire an increasingly literal and invisible status (Cooper 1986). This is particularly the case with respect to how metaphors are used to represent genetics in the media. The use of metaphors such as ‘map’ and ‘code’ have become so ingrained in representations of genetics that they have begun to lose their figurative meaning, becoming literal descriptions of the apparent qualities of genes (Nelkin and Lindee 1995, van Dijck 1998, Petersen 2001).

# Contrast devices

The notion of linguistic contrast has long been recognised as a fundamental aspect of differentiation within human language. According to Saussure (1959), language is a system of differences (in sounds, signs and ideas) that underpin the relational nature of semiosis (cultural signification). This suggests that contrast, as an analytic resource, is a powerful way of explaining processes of categorisation and particularisation. As we saw earlier, the idea behind Sacks’ ‘membership categorisation devices’ is an implicit or explicit contrasting of self-other categorisations in situated encounters. More generally, Garfinkel (1981) observes that within a model of contrastive accounts, what gets explained is not simply ‘why this’, but ‘why this rather than that’. In a way, this links up with what is foregrounded and what is backgrounded (see earlier discussion on figure-ground relations). In various domains the use of contrast has been integral to the construction of social membership (Erickson and Shultz 1982), the construction of social deviance (Becker 1963), educational failure (Mehan 1986) and professional judgement in social work (Hall et al. 1997, 1999).

By revisiting Smith’s (1978) influential study, ‘K is mentally ill’, we find that contrast structures play an important role in constructing the category of ‘mental illness’. This is because the concept of normality is indexical; it is not enough to describe an action as normal, it must be built up through the discursive organisation of descriptive devices. For example:

(i) when asked casually to help in a friend’s garden, (ii) she went at it for hours, never stopping, barely looking up (Smith 1978: 29).

Smith argues that it would not be hard to redescribe K’s behaviour by establishing rules and contexts which provide for them adequately. However, in the above sequence there are subtle cues that ‘orientates’ us to find the action peculiar rather than conscientious. The contrast in proportion between the ‘casual’ request to help and the excessive compliance infers obsession. In the following sequence, it is difficult to see anything abnormal about each of the propositions in isolation; however, as a contrast structure abnormality is implied:

(i) we would go to the beach or pool on a hot day, (ii) I would sort of dip in and just lie in the sun, (iii) while $\mathrm { K }$ insisted that she had to swim 30 laps (Smith 1978: 29).

Both normality and abnormality are constructed simultaneously by establishing a contrast with regard to the activity of ‘going to the beach or pool on a hot day’. The use of pronouns ‘we’, ‘I’, and $\mathbf { \hat { K } } ^ { \prime }$ are used distinctively to bring about an opposition which is syntactically marked by the ‘while-clause’. Each of the three statements is factual and does not offer explicit evaluation. However, modalised cues such as ‘sort of dip in’ and ‘just lie in the sun’ encode the background expectancies for this kind of participation. As Wooffitt (1992) has noted, there is more than contrastive work that is needed to bring off the inference ‘K is mentally ill’; note the use of mental processes $^ \mathrm { { \ell _ { K } } }$ insisted’ and ‘she had to swim 30 laps’ to imply compulsive behaviour, which are also in a contrastive relation to ‘sort of dip in’ and ‘just lie in the sun’. That $\mathrm { \Delta ^ { \circ } 3 0 ~ l a p s ^ { \circ } }$ is construed as an obsessional target is contrasted against the normal expectation that going to the beach ought to be a leisurely activity.

In genetic counselling and in media representation of genomic knowledge, contrast devices play an important role in endorsing or contesting different states-of-affairs, particularly in relation to future characters and events. Our analysis will aim to show how contrasting dimensions of character and event work feature prominently in the management of accountability and ‘genetic responsibility’. Thus, how future actions, scenarios and characters are described in the clinic are important justifications for present and future actions.

# Reported speech and constructed dialogue

Earlier we explained that a fundamental feature of discourse practice is its external relations with other texts. The intertextuality of discourse also has a strong rhetorical dimension: the recruiting of other voices and subject-positions can bolster and legitimise claims; it can also contextualise phenomena by initiating changes in framing and footing. In our analysis, we examine three kinds of rhetorical devices that are inherently dialogic in function: constructed dialogue, reported speech and pronominal reference.

Constructed dialogue, or what is commonly regarded as ‘reported speech’, is an important discourse device in any accounting practice. Tannen (1989) prefers the term ‘constructed dialogue’ to ‘reported speech’ as the so-called reported speech is usually not an exact repetition or ‘report’ of a prior utterance. Also, constructed dialogue can account for hypothetical reports, or what Myers (1999) calls ‘unspoken speech’: ‘words that were not, might not be, or could not be spoken or thought’ (1999: 571). Articulations such as ‘he said, she said’ (Goodwin 1990) not only demonstrate versions of events (Clark and Gerrig 1990), they also offer a rhetorical contrast in favour of preferred options at strategic moments (Hall et al. 1999b), while encouraging desired audience interpretation (Buttny 1998). By claiming to authentically capture events ‘as they occurred’, constructed dialogue enhances the credibility of the speaker who appears to be bearing evidence about matters that are free of interpretation. Constructing or reporting another person’s perspective is also a typical feature of many institutional encounters (Holt and Clift 2007), including research interviews (Schiffrin 1993). Consider the following example from an interview with a mother (M) who is discussing the possibility of testing her two older children:

Example 8: $[ \mathrm { M } =$ Mother; R = Researcher]

1 M: it’s a family choice   
2 R: right.   
3 M: I don’t think-I mean if John stood there-he’s 16 he’s got his own opinions and he tells me his own opinions (.) I don’t think at 16 should turn round to me and say no I don’t want it done, I think it should be a family decision   
4 R: okay.

M is foregrounding elements of constructed dialogue to convey a family apparently engaged in negotiation. The autonomous son (John) is recruited as a participant engaged in hypothetical dialogue with his mother. The use of direct reported speech (‘and he tells me’) allows the mother to establish the authenticity of events by recruiting voices engaged in real time conversation. The implicit charge of imposing limitations on John’s autonomy (‘I don’t think at 16 he should turn round to me and say no I don’t want it done’) is counterbalanced by the dialogical activity encoded in the reported speech.

# Pronominal reference

Another aspect of intertextuality is the focus on subject-positions – the position of author, of character and of the pronouns (e.g., ‘I’, ‘we’, ‘they’, etc.) – by which self-other relations are represented. Brown and Gilman demonstrate in their classic study that pronoun choice derives from ‘two dimensions fundamental to the analysis of all social life – the dimensions of power and solidarity’ (1960: 253). The concept of solidarity can be mapped onto inclusion/exclusion. The study of discourse features such as ‘pronominal reference’ draws attention to how intersubjectivity is represented to index shared or non-shared perspectives in exclusive and inclusive terms (Mühlhäusler and Harré 1990). Choice of pronouns foregrounds relational frames, as illustrated by Coupland and Coupland (2000) in the context of geriatric clinics. Furthermore, the use of third person references for a co-present participant can have strategic implications for the allocation of blame and the construction of fact in social work (Hall et al. 1999a).

# Conclusion

In this chapter, we have outlined an analytical framework to study genetic testing as a mediated and situated phenomenon. The embedding of genomic knowledge in medical practice, in genetic counselling, and its representation in the media, exemplify the ways in which genetic testing creates relatively new tensions and concerns about the management of genetic risk. What we have called Rhetorical Discourse Analysis proposes to investigate these tensions in terms of ‘accounts’. In re-examining the origins of accounts, we have argued for a two-sided definition that treats text and talk as action-oriented and sense-making procedures. Rather than confining ourselves to accounts as occasioned in problematic settings, we take the view that accounting practices are more pervasive. Our approach foregrounds the various ways in which genetic testing is negotiated in both clinical and family settings; the intertextuality of accounts extends our analysis to the domain of public mediation and commercialisation of genomic knowledge. A central theme in this book, and the explicit focus of our analysis, is to illustrate how genetic testing can be understood as tensions arising from, and in relation to, autonomy, responsibility and blame.

# 5 Personal genomics and the media

# Introduction

This chapter focuses on the ways in which genetic testing is commercialised and marketed in the public domain. Studies have already begun to focus on the portrayal of the new genetics in the media as a major source of information about the benefits and concerns of genetic knowledge for the future of the public’s health. The media provide an important interface between scientists and lay publics, occupying an intermediary role of interpreting and disseminating information that forms part of the collective imagination of genomic knowledge. Research has established that mediation and mass communication are far from a neutral process of reporting objective discoveries. Genomics is framed and performed in ways that often reduce the complexity and uncertainty of science, while at the same time aligning new genetic discoveries with certain hopes and anxieties about future health and well-being. This chapter begins by exploring how themes of personalisation combine the promise of greater flexibility and control with consumption of health information. Personalisation provides a frame for understanding the rapid growth of direct-to-consumer advertising in the health sector and the recent emergence of the ‘personal genomics format’ as a distinct web phenomenon. In particular, we focus on how the UK personal genomics company, GeneticHealth, have promoted their services in the public domain. Our analysis draws on a selection of excerpts from the reality TV show The Killer in Me and their company website to examine the persuasive strategies used to create expectations about direct-to-consumer genetic testing.

# Personalisation and genomics

Perhaps, it is no coincidence that the origins of ‘personalisation’ are derived from the field of information technology and personal computing. Personalisation was the invention of the commercial sector, enabling companies to establish more intimate relationships with customers by creating personal profiles, online questionnaires and harvesting private information about consumer habits and desires (Poster 2005). Amazon, for example, has been successful in marketing new products based on ‘personalised recommendations’ and ‘frequently bought’ items (Bonnet

2001). In the last decade, there has been a steady migration of ‘information services’ from the private to the public sector, whereby personalisation now carries the specific meaning of improved and customised service-delivery. In Britain, the numerous calls and initiatives to ‘personalise services’ in health and social care usually focus on end-user autonomy with regard to government services. As with the closely related themes of ‘participation’ and ‘partnership’, ‘personalisation’ appears persuasively benign but ill-defined. We argue that personalisation is strongly linked to the neo-liberal theme of privatisation of risk management (see Chapter 3).

The concept of personalisation can be seen as promising greater flexibility and fluidity in the distribution, speed and specificity of digital information. Flexibility and fluidity are not simply metaphorical descriptions of economic discourse but a characteristic of discourse itself. Fairclough (2003) argues that, with the restructuring and rescaling of neo-liberal capitalism, different families of discourse (or genre) have become ‘disembedded’ from particular networks of social practice and have become redistributed as ‘social technologies’. An example of this mixing of genres is the emergence of ‘formats’. These are texts that are themselves ‘assemblies of different texts involving different genres’ (Fairclough 2003: 69). Websites are a particularly good example of how formats are used by different groups (e.g. corporations, activists, P2P social networks) to create and build a network of consumers, users, informed citizens, etc. According to Fairclough, hybridity and intertextuality are salient features of contemporary discursive practice (see Chapter 4 for a discussion). As we shall see, the genre of ‘personal genomics’ relies on new combinations of languages, rhetorics, genres and discourses to portray genetic testing as objective and authoritative instruments for personal well-being and behaviour-change.

Personalisation is not only a language project, but also an ethical project in the sense that there has been a profound redistribution of responsibilities. In the absence of any stable identity project, Bauman (2000) argues that individuals are now expected to undergo numerous and profound changes when the future course is neither fixed nor self-evident.1 The personal management of risk is a case in point. While risk and contradiction continue to be socially produced, it is the duty and the necessity to cope with them that has become thoroughly individualised. This is particularly relevant in the case of ‘genetic risk’. The commercialisation of genomics has come at a time when selfresponsibility and personal empowerment have become dominant tropes in the marketing of disease prevention. Bauman (2000) has noted that counselling talk and interview techniques are devices employed to access private experience. Risk management is frequently a matter of universal comparison: what others have said and done, what others feel and do, are object lessons that, for the consumer of health, provide a reassuring message of redemption, empowerment and hope. If disease was once a clearly circumscribed event, in the present context of increased flexibility/fluidity, the distinction between health and disease is blurred. Genetic risk guarantees that we are all potential carriers of an undisclosed disorder, rendering our current state of health provisional and calling for constant vigilance.

Personal genomics exemplifies a growing trend of consuming health and wellbeing via digital information. Access to genetic information relating to health and the risk of disease promises greater self-control and self-knowledge, while ancestry and ‘genetic genealogy’ websites promise new opportunities to redefine identity and community. In the information age, the idea of personal and social change has emerged as a key trope and commodity. The value of digital information is defined not by its improved quality or quantity but its ‘granularity’ – the fine grained details that encode more accurate information about a person’s biological potential. The granular aspect of genetic information has become a commodity for personal and social transformation. It is precisely this ‘informatisation’ of knowledge as a commodity – its increasingly granular/digital character – that explains why the internet has become an ideal medium for the commercialisation of genetic testing.

In the case of personal genomics websites, we find a relatively stable format that brings together genres of exposition, personal narratives, spoken and written language, but also various forms of ‘interactivity’ through hyperlinks, email and telephone. Companies that offer ancestry testing, for example, encourage individuals to store and share biological and personal information via sophisticated formats. The ‘community’ metaphor is often used to encourage customers to be ‘active users’ of information and to network with other users. The Californian company 23andMe is an example of a business model that seeks to utilise the social networking opportunities of web 2.0 to inform future genetic research. A distinct feature of these websites is their ‘multimodality’ (Kress and van Leeuwen 2001) – the combination of different semiotic modalities such as photographs, visual imagery, logos, multimedia exposition and personal narratives. The sophistication of these new forms of genre mixing incorporates choice to encourage end-user design in the shaping of services. It is precisely this unique combination of genre and multimodality that is facilitating the current trend towards the personalisation of healthcare service.2 Advances in communication technologies are employing genres in innovative ways – combining a consumerist model with an ethic of participation – to allow consumers to be co-designers and co-producers of services.

The remainder of this chapter will explore how themes of personalisation blur the distinction between health and disease, while offering specific ‘lifestyle solutions’ for the continuous management of genetic risk. In the public domain of television and the internet, we will show that the personalisation of genomic knowledge is mobilised by a complex genre of promotion that promises personal transformation and empowerment. We begin by examining the regulatory background of direct-to-consumer genetic testing before analysing how personal genomics is portrayed and sold to the British public.

# Direct-to-consumer genetic testing

In the UK, there are concerns that direct-to-consumer genetic testing will bypass ethical guidelines designed to protect individuals from the complex effects of genetic knowledge. Research shows that people can react to genetic information in very different ways, ranging from relief and resolution to denial and self-blame (Tibben et al. 1992, Chapple et al. 1995, Michie et al. 2001, Murakami et al. 2001, Featherstone et al. 2006, Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2008a, Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2011). Furthermore, people’s understandings of genetic risk can change over time (Parsons and Atkinson 1992). Given that genetic services have explicitly developed their own ethical frameworks for testing and counselling, the commercial model of ‘direct access’ may be harmful and misleading. More recently, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics have published a report that discusses many of the troubling issues raised by direct-to-consumer genetic testing and medical profiling (see Conclusion for a fuller discussion).

Research in direct-to-consumer healthcare has identified a range of problems that include not only issues of access and equality, but also the potential for being misinformed and misdiagnosed. The very real concern is that direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) is more profitable when it is misleading (Mansfield and Mintzes 2003). A small number of studies have explored public perceptions of DTCA for prescription medicines (Marks 2003, Murray et al. 2004) and the techniques of argumentation and persuasion used to promote prescription drugs (Rubinelli 2005, Rubinelli et al. 2006, 2008). Promotional discourse draws on a variety of rhetorical strategies and tactics, often creating fallacies and inferences through distraction and suggestion. With respect to genetic disorders, there are similar concerns that personalised medicine will generate further ‘genohype’, making promises and creating expectations about diagnosis, treatment and prevention which are, at least as yet, scientifically undeliverable.

As it stands, definitions of direct-to-consumer genetic testing as an instrument remain unclear and contradictory (Melzer et al. 2008). The most serious concern is that misleading consumers is actually harmful: targeting the wrong health advice at the wrong people, leading to over-treatment of healthy people and undermining public health approaches by diverting attention from social, environmental and economic (GeneWatch UK 2009). Those who oppose regulation use the following arguments: that gatekeeping will stifle progress and investment in technologies that can potentially deliver genomic medicine; that dependence on traditional gatekeeping will burden the medical profession with excessive requests to interpret genomic information; and that regulation will artificially distinguish genetic information from other kinds of health and lifestyle services (Zimmern 2009).

Since late 2007, the personal genomics industry has emerged as a rapidly growing field fuelled by the equally rapid drop in the cost of sequencing the human genome. As advances in DNA sequencing technologies, continue to produce faster and cheaper sequencing of DNA (see Chapter 2), there are expectations that companies will be able to sequence an individual’s entire genome. However, the personal genomics industry has attracted a great deal of controversy. The main problem revolves around the issue of clinical validity. Whether or not the entire genome of an individual can be sequenced at an affordable price, there still remains the issue of associating genetic material with specific diseases. Current methods of statistical ‘interpretation’ rely on scientific studies that publish associations between specific genetic variants (SNPs) and diseases. These genome-wide ssociation studies (GWAS)

are carried out on a tremendous scale, requiring large international collaborations involving thousands of biological samples. And while these studies have successfully identified hundreds of sites of genetic variation associated with ‘risk of disease’ nearly of all these lack the large effect sizes needed to make clinically-relevant predictions.

In Britain, there is no pre-market assessment of the clinical validity or utility of genetic tests offered outside the NHS. This means that companies offering so-called ‘home brew’ tests can market genetic information without providing sufficient guarantees that the genes targeted in their analysis actually play a role in the claimed disease (e.g. Alzheimer’s, heart disease, breast cancer, etc.) or serve any useful purpose in terms of medical intervention or health advice. The only assurances that the prospective consumer has are the promotional claims made by the companies themselves.

Internationally, the environment within which these companies operate has recently become less favourable. With the 2009 recession and especially the collapse of the Icelandic economy, the personal genomics arm of deCODE – deCODEme – filed for bankruptcy. Furthermore, the US Food and Drugs Administration has challenged the status of personal genomics testing by requiring Navigenics, 23andMe and others to comply with the requirements of legislation on medical devices, instead of treating it as purely ‘informational’ (see Conclusion for a discussion). There are several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies operating in the UK, the more prominent being G-nostics, Medi-Checks and GeneticHealth.

In the following sections, we have selected discourse samples from the two related sources: the London-based company GeneticHealth and the ITV realitybased documentary The Killer in Me. We have chosen these sources to conduct a case study of a unique event involving a curious partnership between GeneticHealth and ITV. Mediated texts, designed for public consumption and promotion, were selected opportunistically to illustrate the ways in which genetic testing is represented as a novel form of risk assessment. In the first part, we examine the GeneticHealth website as an example of the ‘personal genomics format’ and illustrate some of the rhetorical strategies they use to promote their genetic testing services. In the second part, we explore aspects of the reality television genre and closely analyse key events in The Killer in Me. In our analysis, we foreground the connection between genetic testing and themes of scientific authority, risk perception and risk communication.

# Genetic testing on Harley Street

GeneticHealth is the UK partner of the Austrian company Genosense Diagnostics. Their Harley Street clinic, described on the website as ‘a state of the art diagnostic centre’, represents prestige in the UK personal genomics market. It has also attracted controversy over its services and promotional claims, making it a suitable candidate for analysis. In 2007, the not-for-profit policy research group, GeneWatch UK, wrote a report to the Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Agency claiming that GeneticHealth ‘do not accurately describe the characteristics and limitations of the tests offered.’ GeneWatch based their assessment on the description of the genes and SNPs used by Genosense to conduct their test. In most cases, they found insufficient scientific evidence to establish clinical validity and utility. While this kind of scientific assessment is clearly important, we examine the ways in which promotional language may create misleading expectations and inferences about genetic testing.

The GeneticHealth website is a typical example of the personal genomics ‘format’. The layout of the main page combines text, visual imagery, email, telephone and hyperlinks. A distinct feature of computer-mediated advertising and promotion is the use of different genres of promotion, each with their own rhetorical style. A closer inspection of the main index page reveals a central commentary ‘greeting’ the reader, surrounded by different reading and communication (email and telephone) choices. For example, there are three kinds of reading choices presented: the promotional commentary introducing the service (Welcome), various media endorsements (‘What the media is saying about us’), and traditional methods of advertising (‘Download Our Brochure’). Let us consider the rhetorical style of the central commentary (Figure 5.1):

![](img/a523319ab7fe6bee2863566525ed11960b17f27e693f3cf915edc62f7402c6e7.jpg)  
Figure 5.1 The GeneticHealth website.

The commentary begins with an account of scientific progress and discovery, i.e. ‘Medical research is increasingly clarifying’. Notions of discovery are commonly employed by the media to suggest two things: genes will yield powerful information about the causal factors of disease, and science will objectively reveal an underlying reality. The explicit framing of progress and discovery in terms of ‘Medical research’, however, suggests that the relationship between ‘genetic makeup’ and ‘risk’ is diagnostic. Expectations of diagnosis are worked up by casting genes and environment as causally ‘determining your health’, which is then mitigated by ‘can play a crucial role’. The modal verb scales down commitment to an extreme formulation, with ‘crucial role’ producing an inference of ‘strong possibility’. It is interesting that ‘the way you lead your life’ is simplistically equated with ‘your environment’. This glossing over of many of the external environmental factors adds to the implicit geneticisation of the company’s message, inflating the role of genetics and downplaying those external factors that can only be tackled by collective political action.

Having established this background narrative of progress, GeneticHealth positions itself as providing ‘state of the art’ technology to the consumer. The description of the testing process itself combines informal language with scientificity: ‘specifically look at … selected genes’, ‘have been shown by medical research’. These descriptions attend to the construction of detail and fact, implying that genetic testing is not only objective and accurate but its validity is guaranteed by impersonal processes, i.e., ‘medical research’. Again, the framing of ‘medical’ strategically implies that susceptibility testing is diagnostic while cautiously mitigating commitment and certainty ‘to be implicated with’. In the next sentence, the impersonality of science is contrasted with the pronominal ‘We’ of the company to construct an account of agency and responsibility. It also provides a concise account of what GeneticHealth offers: a service that combines genetic, medical and lifestyle information. This is framed as part of a ‘detailed medical consultation’, suggesting that susceptibility testing forms part of the normal activities of medical practice. Further positioning of the service is accomplished by the description ‘a preventative health company’, which is also framed as medical.

The first three paragraphs of the text establish the company voice as both medical and scientific, which provides category entitlements to make its key promotional claims: ‘provide you with sufficient information’, ‘make informed lifestyle choices’, ‘reduce risk of disease’, ‘live a longer, healthier and more active life’, while accountability is managed by modalising author commitment: ‘aim to provide’, ‘allow you to make’, ‘may reduce’ and ‘potentially allow’. The last two lines of the text are concerned with issues of stake and interest. ‘Genetic analysis’ is invoked as an impersonal process by means of which ‘this mission’ of preventative health is achieved. The term ‘mission’ orients the reader to infer a humanitarian cause rather than a business enterprise, while ‘genetic analysis can assist’, again, implies reduced obligation. The last line is an explicit reformulation of category entitlement: ‘We are a medical company run by doctors and have an active interest in preventative health’, which discounts inferences of commercial deployment.

As we can see, the rhetorical organisation of the web commentary is concerned with building certain category entitlements to make promotional claims which are reduced in terms of commitment to facticity. The explicit and recurrent framing of genetic testing as a medical service appears to be countering the potential objection that it is not a medical service. It also appears to build the expectation that susceptibility testing is in fact diagnostic. This rather strong framing of medical legitimacy and diagnostic capability is unusual for personal genomics companies. On the US websites of companies such as 23andMe, deCODEme, and Navigenics, inferences of diagnosis are more subtle and even explicitly disavowed given the regulatory environment within which these companies operate. Until 2010, these companies have avoided the regulatory hurdles they would have faced if providing a medical service, although the strategy of claiming that they provide not medical but ‘lifestyle’ information is now being challenged. In the very different legal environment in Britain, however, there is no medical regulation regarding the clinical validity of such genetic testing. Here we see a much stronger association between medical and preventative health information. Given the context of debate about the genetic complexity of common diseases, locating susceptibility testing firmly within a medical discourse can produce misleading inferences about the validity of genetic testing.3

Returning to the main web page, we notice an inset in the middle of the commentary titled The Killer in Me. The inset represents another genre of promotion frequently used in advertising: the endorsement. In fact, endorsements are routinely used on personal genomics websites as genres that perform a kind of double promotion: they promote those who are promoting their service. Evidence of this can be seen in the inset: the header displays the title of the show, and the text on the right describes a ‘relationship’ between GeneticHealth and ITV. The stock expression ‘proudly partnered’ is commonly used to describe a contractual or temporary alliance between parties. The image is a still-frame depicting two of the male celebrities who featured in the documentary. Our interest is to investigate how this ‘partnership’ represents the interests of both parties, i.e., promoting a television documentary on genetic screening and promoting genetic screening. How do these different interests combine to produce different or competing claims about genetic testing? How do the promotional claims of a documentary differ from those found on the website?

# The Killer in Me

On 8th November 2007 the reality-based programme The Killer in Me was broadcast on ITV in the UK. The show followed the experience of four celebrities who agreed to undergo DNA testing in 11 disease areas including cancer, Alzheimer’s and heart disease. There is no mention of who conducts the testing, only that the ‘swabs are sent off for analysis’. It is also unclear where the genetic analysis was conducted. The consultations were carried out in two locations: at the Harley Street clinic and at the Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Queen Mary University of London. Our interest is to investigate how promotional claims are worked up and portrayed within the genre of reality television.

The genre of programming known as documentaries is generally considered distinct from reality television. However, in The Killer in Me, we argue that these two styles of programming are conflated. The Killer in $M e$ is an example of hybrid programming that aims to document and sensationalise as well as advertise and promote genetic screening services. The programme combines narrative (presenter’s voice), interviewing and conversation (documenting ‘reality’), and intensifying affect to create fears and expectations about genetic testing. An indication of this hybrid programming is clearly illustrated in the opening scenes of the show.

# Extract 1

[Tense, pulsating music; darkened warehouse; pan to celebrities standing side by side] Four celebrities. About to embark on a journey of discovery.   
[Pan to each celebrity; streaming DNA code superimposed over their faces] They will each take a pioneering genetic test that will unlock the biological secrets hidden within their cells.   
[Pan to celebrities; jerking handheld movement focuses on each] Cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s. Which of these common killers are lurking in their genes? They’ve all agreed to find out the risks they face. Opening a window not just on their lives, but potentially, their deaths.   
[Title of the show appears over matrix-style computer animation of streaming DNA code] [Tranquil music; shot of clouds covering the sun; time lapse photography of human traffic in the city of London] Human beings. Haunted by the spectre of disease. But which diseases and when will they strike?   
[Four celebrities; streaming DNA superimposed over their bodies] These four celebrities have the chance to find out their risk of disease, and to do something about it. But just how much knowledge can they handle?

The opening format combines contrasting imagery, sound and techniques of computer animation to create a foreboding, post-industrial milieu. The obvious allusion to The Matrix is suggestive of a dystopian future in which DNA is represented as a fateful ‘window’ to an uncertain future. The four celebrities are recruited to participate in a reality-based experiment about the effects of undergoing DNA testing. Arguably, the role of the celebrity performs a double function: the celebrity is a vehicle for the public consumption of private experience (Bauman 2000) and a device for the promotion of genetic technologies. The reality-based genre is therefore informational and entertaining: it explores in ‘real time’ the technical and experiential aspects of having a genetic test and promotes general awareness of a novel technology.

The commentary is informal, highly metaphorical and truncated for dramatic effect: ‘Four celebrities: About to embark on a journey of discovery’. The cliché ‘journey of discovery’ suggests that genetic testing will objectively reveal an underlying reality of disease. The diagnostic implications of testing are made more explicit in the next clause: ‘Pioneering genetic tests will unlock the secrets hidden within their cells’. ‘Pioneering’ does the work of framing advances at the frontiers of scientific knowledge, a spatial metaphor which draws on notions of progress and continuity. The clause is active (e.g., ‘will unlock’) representing science as the principal agent responsible for uncovering esoteric knowledge (e.g., ‘the secrets hidden’). Others (Petersen 2001, van Dijck 1998) have commented that media descriptions of ‘secrets’ and ‘mysteries’ serve the rhetorical function of framing the authority of science, that is, legitimising its capacity to discover special knowledge by revealing (e.g., ‘opening a window’) an underlying reality that has predictive health implications.

Usually the discovery trope implies or directly claims that science has found, or is about to find, a universal public good. References to this are routinely cited in the media as in the case when the Human Genome Project is framed as the ‘Holy Grail’ (e.g., the quest metaphor). In the context of genetic testing, public good is framed as ‘testing will prevent and eliminate common disease’. However, this is not exactly conveyed in the commentary above. For the sake of dramatic tension, the presumed benefits of testing are conflicted and unresolved. There is a sense of foreboding that genetic knowledge may have adverse effects. How is this framing accomplished? In the first part of the commentary, the diseases selected for genetic testing are framed as ‘evil’ agents (e.g., ‘common killers’, ‘lurking in … genes’, ‘diseases … strike’). Personification dramatises the relationship between genes and disease by suggesting, through a process of substitution (e.g., disease $=$ killer), that diseases are concrete entities that have a direct and immediate relationship with genes. Interestingly, it does not convey a causal or complex bodily process but a simple relationship of interiority/exteriority. It is the container metaphor (X is in Y) and a further substitution (gene $= { \mathrm { m e } }$ ) that gives the programme its catchy and dramatic title: The Killer in Me. This technique of reduction not only reinforces the perception that our health problems originate from inside us, but that diseases are ‘contained’ within genes.

In the second part of the commentary, the truncated clauses, ‘Human beings’, ‘Haunted by the spectre of disease’, convey a universal state of dread. Diseases are personified as future apparitions (e.g., ‘spectre’) acting on humans in the present. The audience is addressed as members of the universal category: ‘Human beings who worry about their future health’. The framing of universality and personification also implies that disease is inevitable. It is not a question of ‘whether’ disease will occur ‘But which disease and when will they strike’. Scientific knowledge is brought back into the frame by providing our celebrities with an opportunity ‘to find out their risk of disease’, while also affording a degree of agency and choice ‘to do something about it’. However, there is also an implicit contradiction in this message: the promise of personal autonomy seems at odds with the implied fatalism of knowing one’s genetic risk. If ‘common killers’ reside within genes then perhaps there is nothing we can do. The tension between fatalism, scientific objectivism and human agency is dramatised in the final clause. The rhetorical question, ‘But just how much knowledge can they handle?’, implies an acute psychological/emotional dilemma: does genetic knowledge increase or decrease personal autonomy?

As we will see, this tension between ‘more’ or ‘less’ autonomy reflects the sometimes competing interests of the GeneticHealth–ITV partnership. On one side, we have the promotion of genetic screening as a legitimate medical service that empowers consumers to change their lifestyle, on the other, we have the promotion of affect – ambivalence, anxiety and dread – generated by the testing process and the implication of a predetermined fate. In the next section, we examine how accountability of genetic testing is managed in relation to constructions of scientific authority.

# Scientificity

A common strategy of public mediation of science is the genre of science education. Educating the consumer about the science of genetic testing is a necessary part of facilitating a neo-liberal culture of informed choice. Moreover, emphasising the objectivity of testing seeks to manage a range of potential concerns about accuracy, scientific credibility and clinical validity. As we will see, the promotional strategy of The Killer in Me is a reflection of the GeneticHealth–ITV partnership. The hybrid programming of ‘documentary’ and ‘reality’ shuttles between information and entertainment, between medical exposition and celebrity experience.

An example of how this partnership is portrayed is nicely illustrated by the technique of ‘double promotion’. In the following sequence, two voices are sequentially organised: the narrator is heard introducing both the science and the consultant physician, Dr Paul Jenkins, while Dr Jenkins is heard explaining the genetics underpinning the technology:

# Extract 1

Presenter: our genes and our lifestyle are both crucial when it comes to disease (.) but until recently our genetic risks were shrouded in mystery (.) Dr Paul Jenkins (.) senior clinical researcher at Queen Mary School of Medicine (.) is beginning to unravel that mystery.   
Dr Jenkins: we know (.) the environmental influence that can predispose us to disease (.) now we are able for the first time (.) to start to: determine your genetic predisposition um to those diseases.   
Presenter: together with founder Brian Whitley (.) he runs GeneticHealth (.) a company offering a ground breaking new test (.) using the very latest scientific research (.) they claim they can reveal an individual’s susceptibility to a whole host of common diseases.   
Dr Jenkins: well knowing what your genetic component is (.) whether that’s a low risk or high risk (.) allows you to make those informed choices about your (.) lifestyle.   
Presenter: Dr Jenkins says that the test will expose the celebrities’ known genetic risks for eleven disease areas (.) including heart disease (.) prostate and breast cancer (.) osteoporosis and (.) Alzheimer’s.

The presenter introduces the central proposition that ‘Our genes and our lifestyle’ are both crucial factors in disease aetiology. This is contrasted by the temporal scenario in which aspects of this relationship ‘were shrouded in mystery’. Representations of science ‘unravelling’ and ‘solving mysteries’ are effective devices for imputing agency and authority. Dr Jenkins is heard contrasting previous environmental understandings of risk with present understandings of genetic risk (‘now we are able for the first time …’). Contrast structures are particularly effective in emphasising states of change, namely, scientific progress: what we could not do or know before is contrasted with what we can do or know now. Explicit promotional talk is managed by the presenter’s extreme formulations of progress: ‘a ground-breaking new test’, ‘the very latest scientific research’, and ‘a whole host of common diseases’. The enabling effects of genetic information are described by Dr Jenkins in consumerist language (‘allows you to make those informed choices about your (.) lifestyle’). Speaking on behalf of Dr Jenkins, the presenter describes the test as an active agent (‘the test will expose … genetic risks’), which confers attributes similar to diagnosis. Both the layering and sequential organization of voices are effective in accomplishing this effect of double promotion.

Other examples of scientificity on the programme are characterised by more formal descriptions of genetic processes. In addition to the use of a scientific and statistical lexicon, these descriptions are highly metaphorical and analogical, which are intended admittedly to help viewers visualise complex molecular processes. In the following extract, the voice of the presenter is accompanied by computer animation where DNA particles are represented as cell-like structures shimmering in a fluid state. Metaphorical language and imagery are combined to orient the viewer’s attention to the significance of minute individual differences within the human genome:

# Extract 2

Presenter: human beings are made up of around a hundred trillion cells almost all of which contain our complete genetic blueprint (.) our DNA (.) the code that makes us who we are (.) DNA is $9 9 . 9 \%$ the same in all people (.) but the remaining $0 . 1 \%$ can be crucial (.) this is where our genetic difference lie (.) differences that scientists have started to link to a whole host of common diseases (.) if your bad genes increase your risk of life threatening illness (.) the effects of a bad lifestyle could be the final straw.

Metaphors such as ‘blueprint’ and ‘code’ are routinely used by science writers and journalists to convey the difficult concepts of ‘DNA’ and ‘genes’. As van Dijck observes these kinds of metaphors are crucial tools in the popularisation of genetic knowledge which, over a period of time, lose their figurative meaning and become ‘conceptual archetypes’ (1998: 22). The literal properties of scientific models and the figurative properties of metaphors become blurred and delete complexity and uncertainty (Saferstein and Sarangi 2010). For instance, the metaphors of the blueprint and the code imply a surface that is more amenable to interpretation than the models actually allow. Also, they tend to overemphasise the causal influence of genes. In the discourse of the ‘new genetics’, it is customary to include within ‘lifestyle’ a bundle of factors that modify genetic risk, especially in the context of susceptibility for complex conditions. Petersen (2001) observes, however, that even descriptions that recognise the interaction between genes and environment do not account for other kinds of multifactorial interaction. The above description, for instance, does not account for complex genegene interactions nor the small to moderate effect sizes of multiple genes. Cranor (1994) has argued that there is also a concern of ascribing too much causal influence to genes vis-à-vis polygenic conditions. Metaphorical descriptions of causal processes that overemphasise ‘bad’ genes are often part of a persuasive strategy of justifying intervention, in this case, genetic testing. However, the therapeutic target here is not the bad genes themselves but changing a bad (unhealthy) lifestyle. Exposing ‘bad genes’ becomes a warrant for moralising the habits of individuals.

We can interpret ‘scientificity’ broadly to include descriptions of not only genetic and medical research but also other kinds of expert knowledge for which there is a scientific foundation. Epidemiology, for example, is a discourse frequently used in the programme to provide a wider context of genetic risk. This comprises factual information about frequencies of morbidity and mortality for the UK population. It not only serves to educate both the viewer and celebrities about current facts of population risk, but it also establishes a compelling justification for genetic testing. Consider the following examples of epidemiological information:

# Extract 3

Presenter: coronary heart disease is the UK’s biggest killer (.) around half of people who have a heart attack die within twenty eight days (.) three quarters of those die within twenty four hours.   
Dr Jenkins: the last um (.) disease area that we (.) um: n-need to cover is that of Alzheimer’s (.) disease (.) um Alzheimer’s dementia is ah (.) a very large ah problem in the country (.) there’s ah seven hundred thousand people have um: dementia of which Alzheimer’s is the most common (.) cause and th-there is a strong (.) genetic (.) um predisposition to: to Alzheimer’s.

Both examples illustrate that GeneticHealth and ITV have a stake in communicating population risk, though the two styles of description are noticeably different. The first is a written genre of journalistic reporting in which risk information is constructed to maximise affective impact. This is accomplished through the use of analogy ‘the UK’s biggest killer’, compressed risk information, and extreme characterisation of numerical language – i.e. the maximum proportion of mortality (‘three quarters of those die within twenty four hours’). This can be contrasted with the conversational genre of reporting in the second example, where Dr Jenkins is heard communicating risk information to the celebrity footballer, John Barnes. The rhetorical style is much less compressed in terms of information but there are similar devices of maximising risk categories (‘a very large ah problem’, ‘the most common’, ‘there is a strong (.) genetic predisposition’). This descriptive practice of formulating extremes attempts to justify the extent to which a disease would benefit from preventative diagnosis, i.e. genetic testing. In the next section, we examine the ways in which celebrity perspectives are recruited to create a climate of risk awareness and concern.

# Intensifying risk

Programmes like The Killer in Me create a climate of concern to foster what O’Malley (1992, 1996) calls the ‘new prudentialism’ (see Chapter 2 for a discussion of risk). Risk thinking has become a way of bringing the future into the present to make it calculable, and it has become a symptom of modern governance that individuals are increasingly called upon to manage their risk responsibly. The individualisation of risk is intensified via media reporting of crime, but in another way the media also promise what Rose (1999: 247) calls ‘a life of untroubled lifestyle maximisation’. Personal genomics companies can be seen as providing ‘lifestyle solutions’ for the management and prevention of genetic risk. However, in order to create demand for such a market consumers must be made aware that such risks are thinkable and manageable, that future health, for instance, is contingent upon certain genetic and lifestyle factors.

In The Killer in Me, celebrity concerns about risk and the duty or desire to manage it responsibly are worked up as justifications for genetic testing. This method of promotion is set out in the first half of the programme as each of the four celebrities are introduced. The celebrity footballer, John Barnes, offers a particularly good example of how the omnipresence of risk is a good reason for regarding one’s health with suspicion. After confessing to eating junk food and putting on weight, the retired footballer is building up a case for testing:

# Extract 4

Presenter: combined with his eating habits (.) John’s family medical history gives serious cause for concern (.) his father and his father before him (.) both suffered from heart disease and prostate cancer.   
John: we’ve got a history of it-but like anything els:e (.) you believe that it will bypass you or it won’t affect you.   
Presenter: John’s wife Andrea is the driving force behind his decision to take the test.   
Andrea: I’m (.) very worried about John’s health (.) heart disease prostate cancer (.) it’s just-it’s too much of a big risk you know if (.) I think, you know,

if you’re on your own then its fine (.) but having children (.) then you can’t just think of yourself anymore you’ve got to think of your children.

chances are that I’m (.) I’m not as-as I should be (.) and more importantly because I feel ok (.) which is (.) dangerous because you feel ok and maybe there are things going on inside that you don’t know about and as long as you feel ok you tell yourself you are fine (.) nothing’s wrong.

The presenter is an intermediary voice who threads together different genres and segments of the programme – interviewing, reporting, conversation and exposition – to create a coherent and efficient narrative. Here, he is heard linking John’s unhealthy lifestyle with a ‘family medical history of heart disease and prostate cancer’. The narration is not, however, neutral but persuasively oriented to raising concern (‘gives serious cause for concern’). This idiomatic expression is suggestive that, even from a lay perspective, an unhealthy lifestyle and family medical history is a dangerous combination. John contrasts this danger with another: that one might complacently assume that inheritable diseases are remote risks that may fortunately ‘skip’ a generation (‘bypass you’). This fallacy is framed in terms of a denial and orients to issues of responsibility: that a person is irresponsible if they fail to take their risk seriously. John’s wife is introduced as the responsible agent: the driving force behind John’s decision. She describes being ‘very worried about John’s health’, which is formulated as an extreme case (‘it’s too much of a big risk’). Moreover, risk management is not simply an individual responsibility but a familial one. Being ‘on your own’ is contrasted with ‘having children’ as a different kind of scenario in which one might be considered selfish or negligent for not managing genetic risk. The remarkable power of risk thinking is that even the absence of illness is to be regarded suspiciously. John is heard speculating, ‘Chances are that I’m (.) I’m not as-as I should be’, suggesting the likely presence of some undetectable pathology. Health is described as a ‘presymptomatic’ state of disease, which is ‘dangerous’ because one is unaware of ‘things going on inside’. In the age of genetic risk, one can no longer assume there is ‘nothing wrong simply because you feel ok’.

The celebrity DJ, 37-year-old Toby Anstis, is also concerned about risk, but not because there is an established family history of disease. Rather, it is the lack of a complete history that drives both his and his sister’s concern:

# Extract 5

Toby: we have only a fragmented medical history (.) there’s a lot of the unknown (.) and there’s stuff-there’s so much that we don’t know (.) an: that makes us I think worry more than other people might (.) and I certainly worry ((nodding)).   
Presenter: Toby has become a fitness fanatic (.) swimming up to four times a week (.) because there’s one thing he does know about his family medical history (.) that haunts him.

Toby: I’m aware that my natural uncle had (.) ah-a heart attack (.) when he was around forty years of age (.) s: that’s not a lot of information $( . )$ is it to have (.) but certainly to have that little (.) that one piece (.) that whole heart thing you know (.) in the back of your head heart problems heart problems ((waving his hands)) you know (.) I think that makes me worry more (.) and it makes me want to do more to (.) reduce the risk of (.) anything potentially affecting my heart.

A fragmented medical history is a cause for concern because Toby and his twin sister were adopted. Adoption provides certain category entitlements for requesting a genetic test. In the absence of a family medical history, it is reasonable to worry more than other people. Though Toby is entitled to worry ‘in principle’, he also signals strong personal concern (‘and I certainly worry’). The presenter’s description of Toby as a fitness fanatic suggests an excessive concern about risk, a situation brought about by his family medical history that ‘haunts him’. Here, history is enrolled as an actor projecting an onerous future. In what follows, Toby has to do some ‘event work’ to make the scenario of an uncle having a heart attack in his early forties sound like a reasonable justification for concern. Genetic risk is implied via the biological connection with the uncle. The tagged question about lack of information attempts to elicit support, while further rhetorical work is invested in magnifying the importance of that one piece of information about a family medical history that is mostly unknown. The risk of heart disease becomes magnified (‘that whole heart thing’) and repeated (‘heart problems heart problems’) as a disquieting justification for worry.

The next scene is in Toby’s home where the presenter is heard explaining that Toby has taken ‘special measures’ to monitor his risk by buying a blood pressure machine. The interviewer can be heard asking him whether taking his blood pressure ‘is a bit extreme’. Toby looks clearly uncomfortable as he tries to convince the interviewer that ‘a lot people have these now [ … ] they do sell (..) quite (.) quite a bit’. Cutting back to an interview sequence, he continues:

# Extract 6

Toby: for me it’s all about knowing (.) it’s all about the knowledge (.) knowing that if there’s a problem and going off and sorting it out and doing something about it (.) I’d far rather be up front about that than ignorant and just (.) you know assume that everything is fine (.) and this DNA test may well throw up a higher possibility than normal of having some kind of heart risk.

The viewer is already oriented to think that Toby is unusually concerned about the risk of heart disease, and the purchase of a blood pressure machine appears to confirm excessive vigilance. Nevertheless, Toby’s justification is a familiar one. His orientation to preference (‘for me’) locates himself within the category of persons who want knowledge to prevent disease rather than those who prefer to be ignorant. To assume everything is fine resonates with John’s previous account that one can no longer assume a state of health from the absence of disease. The last line indicates that Toby expects genetic testing to confirm his fears of risk. On the whole, these descriptions of uncertainty, anxiety and the desire to manage one’s risk proactively are exemplary statements of promotion. They represent an ideal, risk-averse market to whom GeneticHealth can target their genetic testing services. In the next section, we see how both these techniques of intensifying risk and performing scientificity are combined when the test results are finally revealed to our four celebrities.

# Risk communication

The first half of The Killer in Me sets out to familiarise the audience with each of the celebrities and to ascertain their reasons for wanting a genetic test. In nearly all the cases, family histories of risk are cited as reasons for testing. In the second half of the programme the celebrities’ test results are revealed in a ‘private’ medical consultation. The performance of risk communication is staged by combining the strategies we examined earlier. Genetic testing is promoted by intensifying risk and performing scientificity in the plush surroundings of the Institute of Cell and Molecular Science in London. It also highlights the different and competing investments of the GeneticHealth–ITV partnership. For GeneticHealth, this provides an opportunity to perform medical authority and to demonstrate the ‘empowering’ effects of genetic information. For ITV, these moments provide an opportunity to exploit the real-time tension of delivering good or bad news.

In the following interaction, Dr Jenkins has just informed Toby that he has a reduced risk of venous thrombosis and ‘quite a high risk’ of general cancer. Given that Toby is particularly concerned about his risk of heart disease, our interest is how the communication unfolds with regard to his results:

# Extract 7

1 Dr. Jenkins: um (.) and so (.) really the-the last couple of areas that we-we need to cover are that of the heart (.)   
2 Toby: yup.   
3 Dr. Jenkins: disease (.) and I know this is a concern (.) um of yours (.) um: and heart disease (.) is the country’s-still the country’s biggest killer (.) you know over a one hundred thousand people a year (.) um have a heart attack (.) and a significant proportion (.) um: you know th-they die very acutely they have no warning death is the only s-symptom (.) um and again there are great steps one can take (.) to: minimise and to try and prevent that (.) if you know of your-of your risk um: for that   
4 Toby: ff: ((fanning his face with his hands))   
5 Dr. Jenkins: um so we have looked at a number of the genes that have been shown in the (.) most (.) prestigious scientific journals with the most scientific validity (.) to be associated with (.) um heart disease (.) um and your results um do show that you are at a low (.) risk (.) of heart disease.   
6 Toby: oh gh:od   
7 Dr. Jenkins: which is um: I think reassuring I hope to you (.) um (.) so (.) on the (.) on the traffic light system (.) you are (.) you know at the (.) the low end of this (.) um (.) I can tell that’s um that’s some relief to you (.)   
8 Toby: ((nods and crying))   
9 Dr. Jenkins: so: and you know there’s a number of genes that we have looked at (.) which are all all reassuring.   
10 Toby: ((crying)) excuse me sorry … ff: I was very worried about (.) that one.   
11 Dr. Jenkins: I know you-I know you are (.) I got that from when we first met that it was a major concern   
12 Toby: for a long time ((sniff))   
$1 3 ~ \mathrm { D r }$ . Jenkins: yeah (.) from a genetic point of view (.) you you have a very reassuring (.) profile

A notable feature of the interaction is that risk information is delayed to maximise dramatic effect. This is an unusual practice, and frankly unethical, since the protocols of genetic counselling are intended to minimise the client’s avoidable anxiety and stress. The fact that Dr Jenkins is aware of Toby’s concerns (‘I know this is a concern (.) um of yours’) is also mystifying. He proceeds to engage in the kind of risk intensification we examined earlier by citing epidemiological information on heart disease in turn 3. The information is modalised to maximise severity and personal commitment: ‘the country’s biggest killer’, ‘over one hundred thousand’, ‘a significant proportion’, ‘they die very acutely’; and extreme formulation is particularly effective in describing sudden mortality: ‘they have no warning death is the only symptom’. This is contrasted with ‘the great steps one can take’ to prevent this situation. It appears that Dr Jenkins is taking the opportunity to educate Toby and the overhearing audience about the benefits of knowing one’s genetic risk. A moral tale of prevention is told before risk is communicated.

Delaying information and increasing tension is clearly having an effect on Toby who begins fanning his face (turn 4). At this point, it would take no special training in counselling to detect the signs of stress and communicate the risk without further ado. Dr Jenkins, however, gives another preamble about the credibility of the genetic analysis: ‘we have looked at a number of the genes … in the (.) most (.) prestigious scientific journals with the most scientific validity’. When the information is finally revealed Toby’s shock and relief is palpable. He attempts to show Toby a diagram of his risk probability – a coloured spectrum indicating green on the far left (low risk) and red on the far right (high risk) with a pointer indicating his probability somewhere near the middle in the yellow region. It is unclear whether Toby is taking in this information as he wipes tears from his eyes and tries to compose himself (turns 7–9). It is not until Dr Jenkins acknowledges his emotional state (‘I can tell that’s um that’s some relief to you’) that Toby displays stronger signs of emotional relief. In many ways, the performance of risk communication reflects the overall narrative of the show (i.e. synecdoche).

Let us consider another example of risk communication on the show. Fiona Philips is a 47-year-old presenter who describes herself as healthy, which she wants genetic testing to confirm. However, she is also very concerned about the possibility of developing breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the show we are told that her mother had both these conditions at a relatively early age. The story of her mother’s deterioration with Alzheimer’s is painfully revisited. Fiona is clearly ambivalent about her ‘choice’ – torn between curiosity and fear – and discusses with her two brothers whether she should have genetic testing. They are reticent about the psychological impact of knowing one’s future health and advise her not to go through with it. Later in the programme she has a meeting with Dr Jenkins and Brian Whitley, the founders of GeneticHealth. Naturally, they advise her that testing can have a number of benefits. Dr Jenkins states that ‘probably – more than ninety percent of people have chosen to take the test’; their reason for knowing being: ‘I’d have time to put my affairs in order’. Fiona’s fears of developing the same condition as her mother are addressed by Brian Whitley who states: ‘you are going to continue in that frame of mind, aren’t you $[ \dots ]$ that’s a horrible feeling isn’t it (.) the not knowing’. Genetic testing will presumably eliminate these concerns and allow one to prepare oneself for the future. Given that Fiona was the most reticent of the four celebrities to have the test, her test results are saved for the end:

# Extract 8

1 Dr Jenkins: I think (.) the first point I want to make before we start is that (.) the genetic (.) f-factors well-that are your genes are just one risk (.) part of the overall (.) overall risk package (.)   
2 Fiona: mm hmm ((nodding))   
3 Dr Jenkins: and just even if you are genetically (.) at um: risk (.) for one of these diseases (.) it cat-categorically does not definitely mean you will get (.) that disease (.) perhaps one of the biggest (.) areas ah: of concern (.) is that of: of heart disease (.)   
4 Fiona: mm ((nodding))   
5 Dr Jenkins: heart disease remains the biggest (.) you know killer in this country (.) um: around three hundred thousand people a year (.) have a heart attack (.) um and a hundred thousand of them die (.)   
6 Fiona: mm ((nodding))   
7 Dr Jenkins: sadly from it so it accounts for about one in three of all deaths (.) and we’ve looked at a number of genes (.) um and your results show um that you are at quite high risk (.) genetically of (.) developing heart disease. 8 Fiona: gosh (.) that’s a shock (.) I thought that would be one of my least … 9 Dr Jenkins: no $( . )$ a h   
10 Fiona: $=$ kind of risks actually   
11 Dr Jenkins: $=$ and on our you know risks (.) it does put you (.) you know ((shows on the chart))   
12 Fiona: oh crikey   
$1 3 ~ \mathrm { D r }$ Jenkins: coming up into the (.) the red zone (.) so   
14 Fiona: I am gonna get-I’ve been-I’ve had a real dull pain in my chest for a long long time (.) and I’ve never got it seen to so (.)   
15 Dr Jenkins: and when does-when does that (.) come on (.) the pain   
16 Fiona: um: it’s coming on now (.) funnily enough ((nervous giggle)).

Dr Jenkins begins by emphasising that genetic risk is not predictive or diagnostic. However, as the interaction reveals, Fiona’s reaction is such that she might as well have been told that her results are predictive. Again, risk information is delayed while an epidemiological preamble is given, casting heart disease as the biggest ‘killer in this country’. The same techniques of modalisation and extreme case formulation are used to intensify the severity of risk and commitment to testing. When the information is finally revealed Fiona is genuinely shocked and surprised: ‘I thought that would be one of my least … kind of risks actually’ (turns 8 and 10). Again Dr Jenkins pulls out the chart indicating that Fiona’s risk is ‘coming up into the (.) the red zone’ (turn 13). The visualisation of probability provides evidence of risk. Fiona responds nervously with a defensive explanation providing material support for her genetic predisposition: ‘I’ve had a real dull pain in my chest for a long long time (.) and I’ve never got it seen to so’ (turn 14). We could read this response as evidence of the material symptoms of which susceptibility testing is purportedly predicting or we could read it as searching for an alignment between genetics and experience. Either way Fiona has interpreted the risk information as not only diagnostic (it will happen) but as immediately pathologising (it is happening): ‘it’s coming on now (.) funnily enough’.

# Conclusion

In this chapter, we have seen that genetic susceptibility testing forms part of a public spectacle that trades on the tension between fatalism and empowerment. The preventative hope of personal genomics seeks to transform healthcare by extracting more individualising data about a person’s biological potential. However, the limited application of personal genomics suggests an industry that exploits the deterministic fantasy of DNA to scale up the production of consumable health information. This ‘informatisation’ of DNA transcends pre-existing categories of medical and professional authority. Direct-to-consumer marketing can be seen as converting parts of an individual genome (i.e. SNPs) into digital information – analysed by algorithms and bioinformaticians – to deliver specific ‘lifestyle solutions’. These solutions have, in the Foucauldian sense, major consequences for ‘subjectification’: genomic knowledge will reveal secrets of the soma from which certain life strategies can be adapted to improve one’s health, to live a longer and happier life.

The Killer in Me is an example of a hybrid genre of programming that combines a reality-based format with medical documentary, blending personal experience with bioscientific exposition. This assemblage of information, promotion and entertainment is a product of the GeneticHealth–ITV partnership which, at times, seems to pull in two different directions. On the one hand, the partnership accomplishes a kind of ‘double promotion’ where ITV are endorsing GeneticHealth who are in turn endorsing their own services. On the other hand, ITV have a stake in amplifying the effects of genetic knowledge as a clearly awkward experience for the celebrities. Unlike the commercial website, where personal genomics makes ‘mitigated promises’ of empowerment, the TV format focuses more on the tension between genetic reductionism and personal autonomy.

We have seen how this tension is sustained through various genres of communication – media commentary, medical exposition, personal narratives, conversation, interviews – which are strategically marshalled to inform, entertain and persuade. We identified two overlapping strategies, the first locating a market of concern for genetic risk, and the second, establishing the authority of a science of prevention. What we called ‘intensifying risk’ was a particular descriptive practice of recruiting the celebrity perspective to justify genetic testing. Rhetorical devices such as modalisation, extreme case formulation and contrast structures, were routinely used to problematise health, articulate concerns of risk and inflate perceptions of disease. The strategy we called ‘scientificity’ combined media commentary and medical exposition to portray genetic knowledge as authoritative, objective and deterministic. The use of analogy and metaphor, contrast and extreme formulation, were key devices for promoting genetic testing as a product of scientific mastery and progress. In the critical moments of the programme, these strategies mutually reinforce the validity and authority of interpersonal risk communication. These strategies suggest that the ‘reality’ of DNA testing is a story that is told by building and releasing tension: creating a climate of risk awareness, explaining bioscience, delaying risk information and contrasting the extreme reality of disease with the hope of prevention. We believe that manufacturing this tension may mislead the public into believing that susceptibility testing is unproblematically informative and clinically relevant.

Both on the website and in The Killer in Me there is ambiguity in the relationship between medical knowledge and health information. Whether susceptibility testing is distinct from, or similar to, diagnostic testing remains unclear. On the GeneticHealth website, this distinction is blurred, permitting the expectation that susceptibility testing may have diagnostic consequences, while in the ITV programme the distinction is much clearer. However, even after hearing it explained that genetic testing is not diagnostic, our celebrities still reacted as if the results were predictive. This seems to confirm that, when health information is treated as medical information and framed as ‘genetic’, there are residual perceptions and lingering expectations of determinism. The programme reinforces Bauman’s observation that the pursuit of health, like fitness, is ‘the state of perpetual self-scrutiny, self-reproach and self-deprecation, and so also of continuous anxiety’ (2000: 78). A symptom of what he describes as ‘liquid modernity’ is the blurring of health and disease and the constant suspicion that beneath a state of health lies a lurking pathology. The commercialisation of genetic testing is a logical extension of the fluidity of health and well-being, and The Killer in Me is plain evidence of the manipulation of the anxiety felt by the public, motivating people to participate in a life of continuous risk management.

Personal genomics offers a re-specification of the ancient Delphic maxim, ‘Know thyself’, which holds the client in a tense uncertainty between good-old-fashioned medical advice and doubtful-genetic-horoscope. It is ultimately the user who decides. For instance, there is a revealing moment on the show when John Barnes is explaining the results of his test to his anxious wife, who has previously warned him to cut down on junk food and to eat less salt. When he explains that his increased risk of heart disease means that he should change his diet, exercise regularly and cut down on salt, Andrea Barnes shoots him a glance as if to say, ‘I told you so’. Without a hint of irony, John defensively replies: ‘I knew that babe (.) I knew that $[ \dots ]$ he hasn’t really told me anything I didn’t know’. Even information powered by genomics is a repackaging of old health advice. Nevertheless, the writing is on the wall: change your life or face the consequences. If you fail to act, you will only have yourself (or your genes) to blame.

# 6 Family accounts of genetic responsibility

# Introduction

The term ‘genetic responsibility’ has been used to describe the ways in which new genetic technologies interact with human networks, locating identity within a web of obligations and within new patterns of communication. The practice of genetic counselling has played an important part in facilitating the management of genetic risk in the family context. Psychology would provide key tools through which the principles of autonomy and choice could be communicated, allowing clients and their families to engage in acts of disclosure and to become competent decision-makers. As we will see, the tension of balancing rights and responsibilities are central to accounts of how genetic risk has reshaped family networks.

In this chapter, we examine the literature on family communication of genetic risk in relation to themes of parental responsibility, the child’s autonomy and familial blame. We then draw on interview data with families who have attended genetic counselling and have considered or undergone genetic testing. In the first part, we discuss how families seek to balance parental responsibility with the child’s autonomy in accounts where genetic responsibility is apparently ‘transmitted’ to the child. We will show that, while accounts appear to have a reporting function, they also display responsible forms of parenthood and selfhood in the context of research interviews. In the second part, we explore the ways in which family members seek to display and perform responsible selfhood through blaming other family members. Genetic information throws into relief a complex and discontinuous context of family relations which are implicated in accounts of (non-)disclosure or (not) testing family members. Family accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame show that the domain of genetic responsibility is considerably nuanced and may not comply with professional expectations.

# Genetic responsibility

Issues of responsibility are commonplace in the management of health and illness. In the genetic context, however, responsibility is accentuated by the heritable nature of risk and disease. A characteristic of the new genetics is that responsibility for the management and prevention of risk is not simply an individual realisation but a familial obligation. The rise of ‘genetic responsibility’ is discussed in relation to four different, but overlapping, accounts that describe the impact of genetic knowledge on social life: geneticisation/medicalisation, somatic individuality, genetic networks and family communication.

The increasing awareness and availability of genetic services (i.e. testing, screening and counselling) are said to be symptoms of an ongoing process of ‘geneticisation’ (Lippman 1991). The proliferation of genetic explanations, even as sub-causal mechanisms in disease action, is evidence of a determinism that perpetually strives to reduce health and disease to ‘genetic factors’. In a similar vein, Finkler argues that the new genetics has medicalised family and kinship through the increasing uptake of genetic explanations. Speaking for the American context, she believes that folk understandings increasingly draw from a ‘biogenetic template’ because they imitate ‘cultural conceptualizations of the biogenetic foundations of kinship’ (Finkler 2001: 247, original emphasis). Both Lippman and Finkler seem to imply that there is something repressive in the way that these discourses act upon people’s lives. Genetic narratives are described as powerful agents which constrain and objectify individuals and groups. Whilst it is true that contemporary discourses on genetics (and ‘post-genomics’) retain elements of determinism, the problem with this argument is that it presumes there is something essential to human subjectivity that is denied. Rather than subscribe to the view that there is something necessarily repressive about the new genetics, we believe that genetic explanations and technologies are both productive and constraining. The new genetics not only alters the relations through which subjectivity is constituted but genetic discourses and technologies are themselves modified by these relations and by their domains of application.

Novas and Rose (2000) provide a more nuanced account of the impact of genetic knowledge. They contrast this view of geneticisation with a Foucauldian perspective whereby individuals are neither repressed by dominant genetic explanations nor duped by the illusion of genetic determinism. Rather, the relationship between genetic knowledge and human subjectivity is performative and productive. The impact of new molecular technologies and understandings is said to provide new possibilities for thinking about ourselves as biological subjects. They argue that increasing emphasis upon ‘active citizenship’ has led to expectations and obligations to take greater responsibility for the management of risk. Far from repressing individuals via the ‘medical gaze’, clinical medicine has constituted the patient as an ally of the doctor. Novas and Rose argue that medicine, including medical genetics, is a key site for constituting a particular kind of liberal individuality: ‘free yet responsible, enterprising, prudent, encouraging the conduct of life in a calculative manner by acts of choice with an eye to the future and to increasing self well-being and that of the family’ (2000: 490). The geneticisation of identity must be located within a wider and more complex field of practices that act upon individuals in bodily terms, creating what they call ‘somatic individuality’.

Critics of genetic determinism also tend to focus on the individualising effects of genetic medicine, ignoring the way that genetic knowledge respecifies identity within a network of relations. Armstrong et al. (1998) have shown how the process of genetic counselling locates clients within a genetic space of biological connectedness. Genetic counsellors engage in a two-part activity of constructing family trees around the patient and superimposing this onto a map of illness. The clinical consultation is a ‘technical procedure’ in which the genetic linkages of family connections are added to a diagram of illness. Together these phases form a coherent pattern of entangling individuals within lines of inheritance while searching for origins of genetic risk. Genetic identity is said to be ‘revealed’ within this web of genetic connectedness. Armstrong et al. argue that, unlike other kinds of pathology that may, to varying degrees, stigmatise the patient, ‘genetic disease differs in as much as it promises to reveal who the individual always has been, not a new addition but a revelation about an underlying identity that had been concealed’ (1998: 1658). Genetic medicine forms part of a process of revealing a matrix of genetic risk in which responsibility is dispersed throughout the network of familial obligations and commitments. How these novel networks are brought into relation with each other, how they interact and manage the ethical dilemmas they raise is matter of family communication.

# Family communication of genetic risk

In this section, we will briefly explore two major themes that have emerged from studies of family communication: balancing autonomy and responsibility and performing genetic responsibility through blame.

Despite its radical implications, responsibility within the new genetics is still reliant on old structures of kinship. In Western society, responsibility for family health and the maintenance of family ties falls disproportionately on women (d’Agincourt-Canning 2001). Women are traditionally viewed as ‘gatekeepers’ and ‘transmitters’ of family information (Richards 1993). In the context of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, responsibility for disclosing bad news to family members may be experienced as an awkward dilemma, especially if it is at odds with relatives’ rights ‘not to know’ (Adelswärd and Sachs 2003, Hallowell et al. 2003). While themes of autonomy and responsibility may not be unique to the new genetics $( \mathrm { K e r r ~ 2 0 0 3 } )$ ), they have emerged as conceptually important ways of posing the tensions between rights and responsibilities with regard to family risk communication. This is acutely evident in the case of transmitting genetic responsibility to children.

The concept of ‘autonomy’ has emerged as a central tenet for protecting the child’s right to ‘self-determination’ against parental requests for genetic testing. Genetic counsellors have argued that, if there is no immediate medical benefit, then testing should be deferred until children are sufficiently autonomous to make their own competent decisions (Harper and Clarke 1990). In Skirton’s (1998) study of families affected by Huntington’s Disease (HD) there was no uniform agreement that autonomy was a condition for responsible disclosure. Even though children who are informed about their risk status earlier (i.e. between 8 and 18 years of age) seem to cope better, parental responsibility was generally prioritised over the child’s autonomy. In another study of family communication, themes of responsibility are framed as a public health problem since barriers to disclosing genetic information prevent relatives ‘making autonomous decisions about their health’ (Forrest et al. 2003: 317). Here, parental responsibility is problematised in terms of the ‘disclosure dilemma’, i.e., managing the contradiction between telling children at the ‘right time’ and protecting them from harmful information. Downing’s (2005) study of reproductive decision-making in families facing HD emphasises parental responsibility as displays of responsible selfhood when signalling the potential autonomy of children who should decide for themselves whether to seek genetic testing. In a more general vein, Featherstone et al. (2006) challenge the simplistic view that disclosure of genetic information in the family context is a straightforward and open process. A recurring theme in their study of different genetic disorders is the moral, emotional and practical burden of genetic information, which occasions feelings of anxiety, guilt and ambivalence. Furthermore, moral representations of family responsibility may seek to counter implicit blamings about whether family decisions actually or potentially recognise the autonomy of the child (Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2008b).

Many studies report feelings of guilt and self-blame among parents whose children are affected by, or who tested positive for, a genetic condition (Chapple et al. 1995), while other studies describe the phenomenon of ‘survivor guilt’ expressed by kin who have escaped a positive mutation (Murakami et al. 2001, Tibben et al. 1992). Though accounts of self-blame and guilt are significant in their own right, our specific interest is to understand how other family relations are accounted for in terms of genetic responsibility. For instance, accounts of blaming reveal strategies for presenting the self as responsible and praiseworthy in Downing’s (2005) study of families facing Huntington’s disease (HD). Themes of responsibility are also evident among men’s accounts of genetic testing. Hallowell et al. (2006) show how male carriers and non-carriers of BRCA1/2 engage in different forms of narrative reconstruction vis-à-vis identity and family. While carriers accepted biological responsibility for the part they played in potentially passing on a mutation to their children, they invoked fatalistic explanations to exonerate themselves from moral responsibility. Konrad’s (2007) ethnography of families at risk of Huntington’s Disease illustrates the complex forms of moral navigation around (non-)disclosure found within families. Local negotiations of (not) telling the truth to offspring and children convey the partial, muddled and creative dimensions of individual families’ attempts at balancing responsibility and deflecting blame. Accounts of blame are also oriented to the presentation of responsible selfhood in the context of family decisions to (not) test or (not) disclose genetic information (Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2008a, 2011).

The emerging literature on genetic risk and the family confirms that open, dialogic communication is, in many ways, the default option. In the domain of genetic responsibility, the ethico-moral ideal of effective family communication is modelled on interactional alignment, i.e., when genetic risk is unproblematically disclosed and discussed between family members. But what are the implications for genetic responsibility when family communication is disrupted? Here, we employ the analytic category of ‘misalignment’ as the construction of accounts in which family communication is shown to be problematic and contested. Evidence of problematic situations and events reveals different versions of genetic responsibility.

The participants in our study consisted of families recruited through the All Wales Medical Genetic Service, based in Cardiff, to which they had been referred for genetic counselling. Only adults were recruited whose genetic conditions could have hereditary consequences for their children and other family members. Our rationale was to incorporate as much variability in the sample as possible to understand what kinds of accounting practices emerged across a range of genetic conditions. Families were contacted via their clinical genetic consultant and were invited to be interviewed in their homes about matters relating to family histories of genetic disease, events surrounding clinical diagnosis, family processes of decision making and risk management. Specific information about the genetic conditions has been suppressed since the uniqueness of the family structure and the demographic range of the sample may potentially identify participants. In total, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 44 participants: 33 parents (20 mothers and 13 fathers or partners) and 11 children/adolescents (7 males and 4 females). The ages ranged from 27–55 years for parents and 12–17 years for children/adolescents. In what follows, we show some of the normative and counter-normative practices through which genetic responsibility is managed and performed in the family sphere.

# Balancing parental responsibility with the child’s autonomy

In each of the following extracts we will show that accomplishing genetic responsibility in the family is marked by tensions between competing versions of autonomy and responsibility. We will also see that accounts of transmitting genetic responsibility are rhetorically organised in terms of moral and temporal factors. We use the analytic theme of ‘alignment’ (Stokes and Hewitt 1976) to show how parental talk engages in various kinds of moral presentation: the two that we will consider are aligned responsibility (the joint construction of the ‘dialogic family’ in which genetic responsibility is passed down the generation smoothly) and misaligned responsibility (the foregrounding of blameworthy characters and problematic events). In the event that genetic responsibility has not yet occurred, parents also engage in promissory accounts of deferred responsibility – projecting responsibility towards future characters and events.

# Aligned responsibility

Accounts of this kind are normative displays of communication in which the autonomous child is recognised as a competent decision-maker and included within family discussions regarding the management of genetic responsibility. Our first case concerns a mother (M, 37 years), an affected father/ex-husband (AF, 35 years), the affected son (AS, 14 years), and the daughter (D, 16 years) who, prior to the interview, tested negative for a rare disorder. In the extract below, Mary recounts being contacted by the genetic consultant about the availability of a test that would accurately identify the mutation causing the condition in this family.

$$
1 \ [ \mathrm { M = M o t h e r ; R = R e s e a r c h e r ; A F = A f f e c t e d ~ F a t h e r ; D = D a u g h t e r } ]
$$

1 M: Professor ((name)) yes, sent us a letter this year to say that er, they could now do it ((the test)).   
$2 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : yeah now the technology has got better.   
$3 \ \mathrm { M }$ : yeah and er (.) would we go in and have a talk about it to see if it-we did want to know (.) and we did.   
4 AF: which we all sort of did didn’t we because.   
$5 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : and when you say you did want to know (.) just to-it would re-confirm your diagnosis and give you a very precise  
6 AF: hmm (.) well I-obviously I was diagnosed and I was much much further down the line but (.) the children especially ((daughter)) they were getting to the age now that (.) we’d been told if they didn’t know they would have to have yearly MRIs ((magnetic resonance imaging)).   
7 M: yeah.   
8 AF: to see if they did and obviously knowing (.) a) prepares you but ((daughter)) is-doesn’t have to have them now because she hasn’t got it so.   
9 R: hmm.   
$1 0 \ \mathrm { M } ;$ : it’s-it’s a lot of-yeah unnecessary tests and things.   
11 AF: I think (.) you-you-you’re better off knowing (.) because even if you dwell on it and worry about it you are still going to dwell about it and worry about it with a-have I or haven’t I scenario.   
12 M: yeah.   
13 R: uhuh.   
14 AF: at least you could- and I know it sounds stupid, if you’re going to worry you might as well worry about something that’s there rather than worry about (.)   
15 R: uhuh.   
16 AF: something you know ((daughter)) could worry her head off- and she hasn’t got it.   
17 R: hmm.   
18 AF: so.   
19 R: ((to D)) is that something that you (.) I mean how do you feel about going for the tests and   
20 D: oh I wanted know.   
21 R: yeah.   
$2 2 ~ \mathrm { D }$ definitely.   
$2 3 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : yeah we gave them both the choice.

In turns 1–3, M recruits the voice of the genetic consultant to signal the possibility of taking the genetic test. At first it is unclear if ‘we’ specifies the mother and father or whether the whole family attended the counselling session. A clarification comes in turn 4 when AF signals the family’s involvement. The tagged question ‘didn’t we’ seeks confirmation, inviting M to jointly establish that the children were included in ‘a talk’ about testing. The pronoun ‘we’ in turns 3–4 also helps to convey a dialogical family who agreed ‘to know’ their genetic status, and establishes alignment between M and AF who jointly manage an account of shared, familial responsibility.

In turn 6, AF indicates that because his condition is ‘much further down the line’ he would benefit little from the newly available test. ‘The children’, by contrast, would benefit from the test and, given their age, are considered competent enough to decide for themselves whether they wish to know or not to know their genetic status, which means undergoing yearly MRI scans. The idea that testing ‘prepares’ the child indicates its presumed psychosocial benefits and may actually facilitate autonomy in the maturing child. But it is not immediately evident how or why the children reached a decision to have the test. An explanation is offered in turn 10 where M signals that yearly surveillance for the condition is ‘unnecessary’.

While the relational categories of parental responsibility and autonomous child are so far balanced, the authenticity of the children’s autonomy may be queried. Is the mother speaking on behalf of her children when she mentions the superfluity of medical surveillance or is she speaking for herself? An important clarification appears in turn 11 when AF explains the benefit of knowing in terms of his own autonomy. Speaking from the position of someone who is affected, he recounts his own experience as marked by anxiety (‘even if you dwell on it and worry about it’) and ambivalence (‘have $\Gamma$ or ‘haven’t $\Gamma$ scenario). Here, the construction of psychological events works to justify why regular surveillance is indeed ‘unnecessary’. He explains that, if the anxiety of not knowing were a constant and enduring concern, then performing the test would eliminate doubt. However, AF’s account is also exposed to the implicit charge that the decision to test was not based on the children’s autonomy but his own autonomy (note the ambivalence in the impersonalised expression ‘you’re better off knowing’). In what follows, M and AF rhetorically manage this implicit breach of responsibility by foregrounding the autonomy of the children.

In turn 16, a psychological version of the anxious daughter (‘[daughter] could worry her head off’) forms the centre of AF’s account, which enables a justification of genetic testing in terms of D’s autonomy: it would be irresponsible not to use testing to remove the daughter’s doubt and anxiety. But there is also ambiguity about the authenticity of this psychological account regarding the potential or actual anxiety of the child. If the family agreed that it was better not to know their genetic status before the test was made available, at what point did anxiety actually become an issue for the children and, therefore, a reason for testing? The researcher, perhaps sensing this ambiguity, directs a question to D. In turn 20, D speaks for the first time as an autonomous subject, confirming her decision to have the test on the grounds that she ‘wanted to know’. Any ambiguity about knowing and not knowing, about AF’s autonomy or that of D’s, is subsequently dissolved. In the final turn, M signals alignment with the daughter’s claim: ‘Yeah we gave them both the choice’. Family consensus is reaffirmed in the voice of ‘we’ while the language of ‘choice’ legitimises the balance between parental responsibility and the child’s autonomy. This display of family consensus resonates with Skirton’s (1998) findings that parental responsibility for the disclosure of genetic risk affords greater autonomy to make informed choices about testing.

# Deferred responsibility

Our next case involves another couple: the mother (M, 38 years) and the father (F, 40 years). Their one-year-old daughter was diagnosed prenatally as an unaffected carrier of a relatively common autosomal recessive disease. The extract follows on from a discussion about their reaction to amniocentesis, when it was first revealed that their daughter carried the condition. They discuss the benefits of knowing their daughter’s genetic status, and how they might eventually disclose this information to her. We focus on how the parents foreground the character of the child as a figure onto whom an account of responsibility is projected. Because the child is yet to develop an autonomous identity, much of the rhetorical work is oriented towards the calculation of future events.

$$
\mathrm { M } = \mathrm { M o t h e r ; ~ F } = \mathrm { F a t h e r ; ~ R } = \mathrm { R e s e a r c h e r } ]
$$

$1 \textbf { M }$ : but er- $\cdot ( . )$ I mean it’s nice to know and- and you know (.) we can tell [daughter] when she’s older   
$2 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : yeah (.) but I mean-have you-have you sort of-have you actually envisaged how you might tell her  
$3 \ \mathrm { M }$ : no.   
$4 \mathrm { \textrm { R } }$ : or what you might say?   
$5 \ \mathrm { M }$ : no.   
6 F: no, not really (.) we haven’t come to that yet ((laughs)) no ((several people talking at once))   
$7 \ \mathrm { M }$ : but when you (^^^)   
8 F: er, yeah.   
${ \bf 9 1 M }$ : or when, exactly and  
[6 turns omitted]   
16 F: the thing is, you know, if she-I-I suppose (.) I don’t know when you would tell her (.) would you tell her before she finds a partner or when she’s found a partner and she’s married because it-no matter what (.) if she loves somebody you can’t  
17 R: change, no.   
18 F: change it from loving somebody (.) whether she-she wants, if she wants to marry somebody I don’t think it’s going to change her mind from marrying somebody.   
19 R: yeah.   
20 F: it might just make them think whether they’re going to have-children I suppose so I don’t know what time of her-her life you tell her really-er, I suppose you’d have to just-see as it comes really  
21 R: and-it wouldn’t cross your mind perhaps to not to tell her, that it’s-not- or a necessary piece of information? Do you think it  
$2 2 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : I don’t know.   
23 F: well-I don’t-well, don’t know really er  
$2 4 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : hmm (.) they’ve got a-kind of what the assumption that of  
25 F: yeah (.) I suppose until she’s developed   
$2 6 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : $=$ you ought to tell her but.   
$2 7 ~ \mathrm { F }$ : $=$ into a person-person and she’s got her own character and her own views on things-I suppose it’s a job to-to say-which way it would affect her.   
$2 8 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : yeah if she did marry somebody (.)   
$2 9 \ \mathrm { F }$ : yeah.   
$3 0 ~ \mathrm { M }$ : that was a carrier and-she-she did have a child and then it came back you know, that oh we knew or something.   
31 R: hmm.   
$3 2 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : but-but it-as you say (.) you can’t prevent it then but because-who’s to know the man she’s ever going to meet-is the real thing?   
33 F: yeah (.) I think as we do, as we know (.) and er (.) as we are her parents I think it’s only for us to-to pass that knowledge on to her (.) you know er.

At the outset M makes an unsolicited comment about the benefit of knowing her daughter’s carrier status. She mentions, almost in passing, ‘we can tell [daughter] when she’s older’ (turn 1). The researcher responds by asking, in a reflective frame (Sarangi et al. 2004), whether she has considered ‘how’ they might pass this information to the daughter (turn 2). M responds with an unqualified ‘no’ in turns 3–5, exposing herself to the implicit charge that she is either unable to provide a responsible account or she has not yet considered the ethical consequences of the daughter’s carrier status. F rebuts this charge when he says: ‘We haven’t come to that yet’, taking joint responsibility for an event that is now temporally located in the future.

In turn 16, F formulates uncertainty about the temporal conditions of disclosure and recruits an autonomous version of the daughter at reproductive age. Framing the daughter in this way allows $\mathrm { F }$ to engage in further ethical speculation: should the daughter be informed about her carrier status ‘before’ she meets her future partner or ‘when’ she meets her partner? In turn 20, the autonomous daughter and prospective partner now form the centre of F’s account; if both are informed about the reproductive risks they will have to decide for themselves whether they are prepared to have children. The difficulty of specifying a clear event of disclosure stems from the unforeseeable circumstances of a daughter who is approaching reproductive age. F frames this difficulty with the ambivalent formulation: ‘so I don’t know what time of her-her life you tell her really’.

The ambivalence of M’s and F’s account is probed further in turn 21, with the researcher orienting to the possibility of non-disclosure. Their indecisive responses in turns 22–23 allude to the fact that parents are indeed responsible for disclosing genetic information to the child. F counters their ambivalent position in two ways: firstly, foregrounding the figure of the autonomous child signals respect for the daughter’s future autonomy, and secondly, it draws the discussion away from engaging in further moral calculation about their own responsibility. In turns 25–27, F constitutes the daughter as a self-determining subject who has ‘her own character and her own views on things’. In building the character of the daughter this way, $\mathrm { F }$ can now orient the discussion to how knowledge of her carrier status might affect her psychosocially. This move is interesting because it forms an alignment with the researcher’s ethical position in turn 26, and it displays the circumstantial and psychological factors that might impair the child’s future autonomy.

The theme of ‘telling’ the daughter becomes the focus of the remaining discussion. In turn 28, M signals agreement with F and jointly constructs a hypothetical scenario where disclosure could occur after the daughter marries and produces an affected child. The formulation ‘oh we knew something’ is an interesting temporal device that anticipates the blameworthy scenario of not disclosing information that may have prevented the birth. It is worth noting that the absence of constructed dialogue in this discussion is explained by its temporal framing, in which case the object of moral calculation is not so much how to disclose but when to disclose.

F joins the discussion in turn 33, signalling agreement with M, but does not contribute to the problem raised in the previous turn. Instead, he orients the discussion to present roles and responsibilities, which is immediately realised by a change in participation structure. The coding of ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘her parents’ frames the display of parental responsibility as a joint activity and a normative moral obligation. This account of deferring responsibility resonates with the problem of timing disclosure (Forrest et al. 2003, Skirton 1998) and the kind of ambivalence surrounding family communication (Featherstone et al. 2006). At the local level, the frequent use of mitigations (e.g. ‘I suppose’), hesitations and F’s explicitly ambivalent assertions not only encode a high degree of uncertainty, but also signal difficulty in forming an account of responsibility.

# Misaligned responsibility

So far, we have examined two accounting practices which are linked temporally and relationally. That is to say, ‘aligned’ responsibility and ‘deferred’ responsibility are both joint performances which can be placed on either end of a temporal continuum (retrospective versus prospective accounting). The third pattern, ‘misaligned responsibility’, is markedly different for reasons that are mostly relational rather than temporal. Data Extract 4 concerns a woman (Mary, 39 years) whose seven-year-old daughter is affected with an inherited disorder. Her current partner (Paul, 41 years) is still married to a woman (Wendy) with a different inherited disorder, an early-onset dementia (EOD). Paul’s 19-year-old son (Steve) lives with Paul and Mary. The extract begins with Mary providing an account of Paul’s wife; the deterioration of her condition, and the effect this has had on Paul and Steve in relation to Steve considering testing for EOD. We focus on how Mary frames her responsibility towards her own daughter’s condition by contrasting it to how Steve and Paul struggle to accept responsibility for Wendy’s condition.

Extract 3 [ R: researcher; M: Mary]

1 M: and she’s ((Wendy)) in the last stages now she can’t speak, she’s incontinent, she can’t swallow, she just lies there (.) she’d had it about four years when I’d met him and she was having care-taking care of her then and it took a long time for the family to accept me because his side of the family could see that he was still young enough to have a life and he couldn’t handle-she was having care to the house he couldn’t handle her and then there was her side of the family that thought it was absolutely horrific that he should have another woman and I was the other woman but she’s deteriorated and as I say has been in a nursing home (.) his son lives with us as well his son is 19 and he doesn’t know whether he’s got it or not so this is why I’m saying he’s got a girlfriend at the moment which is quite serious, its his first love I suppose and he does know about his mum.

2 R: does he know about the sort of inheritance?

$3 \ \mathrm { M }$ : oh yes but I don’t think he really understands.

[6 turns omitted]

10 R: yeah, and have they talked about testing?

11 M: no (.) if I say to Paul about it you know Steve’s obviously sleeping with ((girlfriend)) because she-he won’t let them sleep here together but her mum lets them sleep together.   
12 R: yes.

$1 3 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : so obviously he stays over there and I’m quite-Paul’s quite-I’m quite open I’ve been with my son I’ve got a son of 17 so I’m quite open with him and I can say to Steve I hope you’re using precautions.

14 R: yeah.

$1 5 \ \mathrm { M } ; $ : you know you be careful now, you make sure you’ve got a hat on it and I can joke with him like that and he says, oh sure yeah I’m not stupid and I said well look you don’t want any accidents son you’re only young so you know what can happen but Paul will say, well you know I hope you’re taking precautions because you know what with your mum’s illness you don’t want this to happen, you know does she know about your mum’s illness, he won’t-he’ll talk about it but from a distance.

16 R: yeah, yeah, yeah.

$1 7 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : so when I was first with Paul-Steve and I had a lot of-we used to sit up and talk about his mum because I knew his mum from school because she’s only a year older than me so I was saying, you know I remember your mum from school, she’s very attractive and he was getting upset saying I don’t remember my mum ever not being ill and the youngest time I remember was 8 so I always remember my mum being ill which I thought that was really sad.

$1 8 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : its such (^^^) isn’t it?

19 M: so I mean he’s got to go through all that so I can understand what that other families are going through and Paul says he’ll-it’s up to Steve to want to be tested but unfortunately he’s doing an apprenticeship and as you know as soon as you get tested everything changes, all your insurance, everything so we just-I don’t know and I think Paul’s afraid what if it comes back positive, he doesn’t even want to think about that he’s only got the one son so its difficult (.) as for me I can accept ((daughter’s))- ((daughter’s)) is different, you know I can accept her’s but Paul can’t but then we all have to deal with it in different ways.

Mary’s description of the deterioration of her partner’s wife serves a number of rhetorical purposes: it provides a preliminary account of the circumstances of when she met Paul; it invokes the complex moral circumstances of how Paul’s and Wendy’s families reacted to their relationship; and, in view of these circumstances, it allows Mary to position herself as ‘the other woman’. But these events also provide the discursive resources for framing Paul as a diminished figure – as someone who could not ‘handle’ caring for his wife, and who was ‘still young enough’ to form a relationship with another woman. This skilful reversal of responsibility is also extended to Steve. Towards the end of turn 1, Mary frames Steve’s sexual conduct as irresponsible, which could result in his ‘girlfriend’ falling pregnant with an affected child. The rhetorical function of ‘and this is why I am saying’ allows Mary to position herself as the responsible participant who foregrounds the impending risk of Steve’s actions.

In turn 10, the researcher asks whether Paul and Steve have discussed genetic testing. Mary’s negative response is accompanied by a contrast and the use of hypothetically constructed dialogue (‘If I say to Paul’), suggesting she has drawn attention to Steve’s risky behaviour in the past. Because Paul does not allow Steve and his girlfriend to sleep together in the house there is an implied distance between father and son, with the suggestion that they are not inclined to discuss genetic testing. This distance is contrasted by how Mary engages in friendly communication about safe sex: ‘I’m quite open with him and I can say to Steve I hope you’re using precautions’. A contrast is invoked to express a difference in communication between father and son. In Mary’s communication, Steve is heard to respond by indicating he is indeed taking precautions. In Paul’s communication, there is no dialogue and no reply to the direct question: ‘does she ((the girlfriend)) know about your mum’s illness’. So while there is apparently no discussion about testing, Mary ascribes partial responsibility to the father who engages in risk communication with the son, but only ‘from a distance’. By foregrounding father–son relations where it is evidently difficult to discuss matters of risk, Mary is able to display herself as someone who can engage in effective risk communication with Steve, thus implying that the problem lies with Paul.

In turn 17, Mary skilfully constructs a temporal (past) account of intimate talk with Steve about his mother, W. A sense of intimate dialogue is encoded (‘and he was getting upset saying’), which might explain Steve’s difficulties in seeking a genetic test. In turn 19, Mary positions herself as someone who recognises the burden of responsibility that comes with managing risk, which is offset by the father who can only appeal to the boy’s autonomy. By recruiting Paul’s voice (‘Paul says he’ll-it’s up to Steve to want to be tested’) she is able to convey the practical and ethical contradictions that come with individual responsibility. If Steve is tested positive then ‘everything changes’, but there is also a sense that Paul appeals to his son’s autonomy because he is unwilling to take responsibility for a test that ‘comes back positive’. Again, this scenario forms the basis of a relational comparison whereby Mary positions herself as the responsible agent: ‘As for me I can accept ((daughter’s)) … but Paul can’t but then we all have to deal with it in different ways’. Here, a prominent feature of enacting genetic responsibility is the use of character work as a contrast device.

So far, we have shown three patterns in which performing genetic responsibility is temporally and relationally organised. Accounts of alignment and misalignment, of past and future characters and events, are ways of orienting to affairs in which genetic knowledge is (not) passed to the next generation. In many cases this involves strategically enrolling the voice of the child to convey a ‘dialogic family’. However, not all families exemplify this moral ideal of open and inclusive communication. Decisions about testing and/or disclosing to children or young people are complex relational phenomena, which pose practical and moral dilemmas for families. In the next section, we turn to the notion of blame, which is inextricably linked with responsibility.

# Responsibility and blame

In the following examples, we will see how family accounts of genetic responsibility often locate an ‘other’ against whom blame is labelled. Beyond its reporting function, we argue that blaming others are ways of signalling self-responsibility. This is particularly evident in the context of disclosing genetic risk to other family members. For instance, the formulation ‘So I told Paul but he was in denial’ is a clear example of other-oriented blame, which also signals responsibility for disclosing genetic information. Such formulations are realised by contrasting the self/other dimension, often modulated to signal implicit and/or explicit accounts of blame/responsibility. Other framings distinguish between character work and event work (see Chapter 4) whereby speakers invoke internal/external categories to intensify or mitigate blameworthy persons. For example, blameworthiness is more explicitly formulated in ‘my mother is a very selfish person’ compared with ‘my mother doesn’t understand she’s old-fashioned’.

In our next example, M (32 years) is an affected woman with an inherited tumour whose five-year-old son recently tested negative for carrier status. In Extract 4, it has been established that the genetic consultant wanted to test M’s Uncle (father’s brother) for the hereditable disorder, which M advised against, as it would expose her father’s questionable paternity (‘my dad was a bit of a mix’). She believes the test results would expose the grandmother’s presumed infidelity to the family and would ‘destroy both my dad and his little [brother]’. In the sequence below, M responds to the researcher’s probe as to whether she desires to know her ‘genetic history’.

Extract 4 [ $\textrm { R } =$ Researcher; M = Mother]

1 R: is it something that you think is important knowing that kind of $( . )$ because he’s still your grandfather like lets say a social way but is there a sort of genetic kind of urgency like I ought to know who my genetic kind of history is.   
$2 \ \mathrm { ~ M }$ : no.   
$3 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : that kind of thing.   
$4 \ \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ : no because I just feel if I did $( \spadesuit )$ gone into looking $( \spadesuit )$ its just going to hurt (^^^^^^) which is why I’m quite happy $( \wedge \wedge \wedge )$ because I’ve got three cousins (.) my uncle’s got three (children) and it could upset them as well knowing that (.) I mean they idolise their grandmother and I just don’t want those memories ruined for them as well so I just think its best to let sleeping dogs lie that’s the way I see it but no my mother would love it she really wants it (^^) and I’ve said no (.) no.   
5 R: and what’s in it for your mum then do you reckon or has she said?   
6 M: just sort of bitch off at my grandmother who’s dead because they didn’t get on so I just think it would be an opportunity for her to turn around and say see I told you so (.) that’s all it is a revenge type of thing (.) so its like I said no chance.   
7 R: umm.   
8 M: I might not get on with my dad so I couldn’t put my dad through that I couldn’t put my brother through it and I certainly couldn’t put my three cousins through it but there’s no chance she wouldn’t see it like that it’s a vendetta against my nan and against my dad.

Our interest here is how M offers a justification for not disclosing genetic risk to other family members. The explanation ‘it’s just going to hurt’ suggests that such enquiries would expose doubts about her father’s paternity, affecting not only her uncle but also his children’s relationship with their grandmother. Non-disclosure is justified because it would prevent further misalignment in family relations. She develops this account by recruiting the ‘three cousins’ as figures of potential misalignment. If a ‘genetic history’ revealed its secrets ‘it could upset them’ or damage the ‘memories’ of their deceased grandmother.

Having established the grounds for avoiding misalignment, M restates her justification with the proverbial metaphor ‘it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie’ (turn 1). Two aspects of this statement warrant attention. Firstly, the proverbial meaning carries with it the received wisdom that one should not exacerbate old problems. Secondly, its formulation as an extreme case (‘best’) asserts the maximum proportion of what is right or just. The reader/listener is invited to hear this as a persuasive justification that no possible good could come from exposing the family’s genetic history. Such circumstances legitimate the unorthodox view that prevention of testing/disclosure is actually consistent with genetic responsibility. This is offset by the blameworthy figure of ‘my mother’ whose motive to endorse a genetic history foregrounds the unorthodox view. M counters this viewpoint with an emphatic rejection of the mother’s request for genetic testing (‘and I’ve said no’). In response to R’s probe regarding motive and intentionality, M recruits the hypothetical voice of the mother (‘see I told you so’) and establishes motive (‘a revenge type thing’) to cast the qualities of a character whose motivations are entirely personal and vindictive. This unorthodox view of genetic responsibility is sustained when testing is thought likely to expose the ‘truth’ of paternity and therefore uncover family secrets. Blame/responsibility is dramatised by contrasting the personal and the familial, and by illustrating that ‘appeal to family loyalties’ is sufficient justification for avoiding circumstances where genetic testing may lead to blaming.

In addition to contrasting views of genetic responsibility, blame work is also oriented to characters (parents, siblings and cousins) whose understanding of genetics is posed as an obstacle to risk communication (especially after disclosure has occurred). In Data Extract 5 we have a couple (FP, 36 years; MP, 34 years) whose one-year-old child has been diagnosed as a carrier of cystic fibrosis (CF). FP was identified prenatally as a carrier of the disorder; she briefly describes her reaction to diagnosis and her attempt to disclose carrier status to her parents. In particular, we examine how an account of ‘not blaming’ is jointly managed.

# Extract 5 [ $\mathrm { F P = }$ Female Partner; $\mathrm { M P } = \mathrm { M a l } \mathrm { \Omega }$ e Partner; R = Researcher]

1 FP: it’s just a funny thing to think I’ve gone thirty six years (.) having been a carrier but I can’t speak to my parents about it I’ve tried to mention it but it’s like ignorance is bliss they just I wouldn’t even st$2 \ \mathrm { ~ M P ~ }$ : well they don’t understand they don’t. $3 \ \mathrm { F P }$ : they don’t understand. $4 \ \mathrm { ~ M P ~ }$ : you know we don’t understand that much but. $5 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : hmmm. $6 \ \mathrm { \ M P }$ : we’ve been told by.

$1 0 \mathrm { \textrm { F P } }$ : because my mother doesn’t fully understand amniocentesis or anything.   
11 MP: yeah.   
12 FP: I mean she’s had four of us and she had a rough time with all of us but (.) but there was none-none of this going on at her (.) time of life.   
$1 3 \ \mathrm { \ R }$ : yeah I know.   
14 FP: really (.) so I’ve mentioned it once or twice but they just my mum just changes the subject.   
15 R: right so it’s not  
16 FP: no.   
17 R: doesn’t want to know or isn’t  
18 FP: no I don’t think so so some-my mum and dad-well.   
19 MP: it’s something they don’t understand.   
20 FP: yeah.

21 MP: they don’t wanna know.   
22 R: yeah.   
23 MP: you know it’s just a (.)   
24 FP: and that’s-yeah.   
25 MP: the old fashioned way they are.   
26 FP: and it’s not affecting anybody (.)   
27 MP: yeah.   
$2 8 \mathrm { \textrm { F P } }$ : as far as they’re concerned so.

FP describes the phenomenon of having an old identity revealed as a genetic identity via medical disclosure (cf. Armstrong et al. 1998), the hereditary basis of which is attributed to ‘my parents’. The formulation ‘I can’t speak to my parents about it’ signals misalignment between her parents and the new identity. Also ‘I’ve tried to mention it’ foregrounds self-responsibility, in which case the problem lies with the parents. The proverbial ‘it’s like ignorance is bliss’ performs at least two important rhetorical functions: the suggestion of ‘ignorance’ is constitutive of character while at the same time justifying FP’s inability to disclose.

The potential blameworthiness of the parents is mitigated by their lack of ‘understanding’. Both FP and MP jointly construct this as an excuse in turns 2–3. MP even admits their own lack of understanding, thus suggesting that it might be unfair to blame the parents. In turn 12, MP provides additional resources for excusing her mother: the reference to ‘rough time’ and the expression ‘but none-none of this was going on at her time of life’ invoke exonerating historical circumstances. In turn 14, FP returns to the theme of misaligned disclosure, this time imputing intentionality to the mother: ‘my mum just changes the subject’. The researcher, perhaps sensing this shift, orients to the mother’s ‘intentionality’ rather than ‘ignorance’. This results in a situation where blaming is sustained and mitigated in turns 19 and 21. While MP imputes intentionality and agency to both parents (‘They don’t wanna know’), reference to the ‘old fashioned way they are’ $\left( \mathrm { t u r n ~ } 2 5 \right)$ ) subtly mitigates responsibility. In what follows, a position of not understanding or not wanting to understand is sustained as an excuse since, from the perspective of the parents, carrier status is literally interpreted as a condition whereby no-one is actually affected. But the potential risk, though something worthy of disclosing, remains unaccounted for and misaligned.

In our analysis so far, blame work underpins a scenario where disclosure of carrier status fails to result in open communication. Self-responsibility is claimed for disclosure, but other-oriented blame is withheld on the pretext that nonunderstanding of genetics counts as a legitimate excuse for not blaming the parents. This ‘not blaming’ of the parents produces a complex position where blame/ responsibility is both mitigated and sustained.

While blaming or not blaming parents is a subtle and elaborate exercise, blaming siblings involves noticeably less duty to exonerate. In the interaction below, which is an extension of Extract 5, FP is discussing issues of disclosure/testing in relation to her siblings.

Extract 6 [ $\textrm { R } =$ Researcher; $\mathrm { F P = }$ Female Partner; MP $=$ Male Partner]

$1 \ \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : so well none of your-your sisters or brother have test, have had a test  
2 FP: no. $3 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : to see if they’re carrier status. $4 \ \mathrm { F P }$ : no no. $5 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : is it something that you6 FP: I’ve told them all. 7 MP: hmm but-yeah (.) you  
8 FP: I think my eldest sister (.) only because you know she’s she’s more she’s got a PhD in biology so she ((chuckles)) thinks along (.) she’s the only one that’s taken sort of a bit of interest in what I said to her (.) 9 R: hmm.   
10 FP: by the way I’m a carrier (.) she said ahh, you know and I think they would (.)   
11 MP: Hmm yeah.   
12 FP: I think my sister in [place] ((chuckles)) it went in one ear and out the other.   
13 MP: yeah (.) she didn’t-went through her head I think.   
14 FP: yeah.   
15 MP: ((laughs))   
16 FP: and then my brother and-well I told my brother and his wife well (.) when she was pregnant but she hadn’t told any of us.   
17 R: hmm.   
18 FP: so I said oh (.) you know (.) you know if you feel you ever need one to test or (.) and [brother] (.) you know (.) my brother (.)   
19 R: hmm.   
20 FP: I am a carrier (.) ohh right (.) you know.   
21 R: but no-one sort of  
22 FP: no.   
23 R: taken the-given the  
24 FP: no.   
$2 5 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : whatever curiosity they’ve got to  
26 MP: no.   
27 FP: (.) no just my eldest sister really which I think she would-she-she’s the one who had the amnio as well (.) I think if she was think-planning to have a second-I think she would now think oh (.) let-let’s go and have some blood taken.

In turns 1–4, FP establishes that none of her siblings has pursued carrier testing for cystic fibrosis. After providing confirmation (‘I’ve told them all’), FP points to the contrastive character of the ‘eldest sister’ whose ‘PhD in biology’ counts as justification for responding positively. In turns 10–11, the disclosure of carrier status (‘By the way, I’m a carrier’) and its receipt (‘ahh’) are framed as a dialogue between the sisters. Blame is implicit in turn 12 as the eldest sister’s action is contrasted with that of the youngest. The formulation ‘it went in one ear and out the other’ carries the suggestion that FP’s disclosure made no impact. This is cast as irresponsible, unlike the mother’s apparently genuine ignorance/non-understanding in Extract 5. Blame work is also jointly managed as MP alludes to the implied fatuity (note laughter) of the youngest sister (turn 13).

Continuing the theme of disclosure, FP orients to the brother and ‘his wife’ in turn 16. The passing remark ‘when she was pregnant but she hadn’t told any of us’ is a subtle index to misalignment. Responsibility for disclosure is signalled via reported speech (‘So I said’) as FP offers support to the sister-in-law (turn 18), followed by the act of disclosure to her brother (‘I am a carrier’). His reply, reported in turn 20 (‘ohh right’), conveys feigned interest and/or non-understanding. This is contrasted with FP’s alignment with the eldest sister who has undergone ‘amnio’. In the hypothetical event of ‘planning’ another child, the eldest sister is heard to consider having a genetic test: ‘oh, let-let’s go and have some blood taken’. An interesting aspect of the blame work performed here is the way disclosure is (not) reciprocated by siblings. In the case of the older sister, knowledge of biology explains why she responds in a positive and praiseworthy manner while lack of understanding is posed as an obstacle to risk communication in relation to the other siblings.

In the final extract, three participants are present in the interview: the mother (M, 36 years), the father (F, 39 years) and the researcher (R). M was identified as a carrier of Fragile X after her son was diagnosed with developmental delay and behavioural difficulties. The couple are currently waiting for carrier testing of their six-year-old daughter. M’s cousin (Heather) also has a son with Fragile X. Blaming occurs in relation to Heather who fell pregnant before testing positive as a carrier.

Extract 7 $[ \mathrm { R } = \mathrm { R e s e a r c h e r ; M } = \mathrm { M o t h e r ; F } = \mathrm { F a t h e r } ]$

$1 \textrm { R }$ : and have the rest of the family been tested?   
$2 ~ \mathrm { M } .$ : my aunty Jen got tested and her two children are grown up but the son’s got children and it came back negative with her (.) erm (.) obviously Terry has got it because both daughters were then tested and then Jane was tested and Melissa’s recently been tested and it was positive on her so there wasn’t any doubt (^^^^^) so for him there is no reason for him to have the test because he’s got (^^^^^^^^) so there was no point going down that road with her (.) my mum is the eldest (^^) but the daughters are aware (^)   
$3 \mathrm { \textrm { R } }$ . and they haven’t decided to (^^^^)

5 F: it was $( \spadesuit )$ by us wasn’t it (^^)

6 M: so she’d got pregnant first had the baby and then got tested and it’s come back positive and baby is showing and the baby is showing problems but it may have nothing to do with you (.) you don’t know.   
$7 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : but there seems to be a kind of issue about responsibility (.)   
$8 \ \mathrm { M }$ : yeah.   
$^ { \textrm { \scriptsize 9 R } }$ : about knowing before?   
$1 0 ~ \mathrm { M }$ : it’s not like gran said (.) if she didn’t know before then if she’d gone ahead and got pregnant then that’s okay you know we wouldn’t have gone on at her (.) that was her decision but then to get pregnant and then go and have the test done to see if there’s fragile X when she knew this before she started to (.) decided to start a family (.) she wasn’t pregnant (.) told members of the family it just seemed an odd thing to do.   
11 R: has she explained why she did it in that order if you like?   
$1 2 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : no she’s not (.) she’s the sort of person who is ignorant of things.   
$1 3 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : umm.   
$1 4 \ \mathrm { M }$ : I wouldn’t say she doesn’t care but (.)   
$1 5 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : but then it’s kind of intriguing that she decided to have the test at all do you know what I mean.   
$1 6 \ \mathrm { M } .$ : that’s what me and Jane ((M’s cousin)) were puzzled with.

As we can see, an account of family testing is offset by the cousin, Heather, who, despite ‘knowing’ the hereditary risks, tested positive after pregnancy (turn 4). It is worth noting how blame allocation is accomplished through the figure of the grandmother who ‘crossed her words’ and ‘was very upset’. The resources for establishing blame are also encoded in the temporal reporting of events (‘so she’d got pregnant first had the baby and then got tested’), from which M can impute agency and intention, casting Heather as careless and irresponsible (turn 6). The formulation ‘the baby is showing problems’ provides further evidence of blame, which is promptly mitigated to soften the charge: ‘it may have nothing to do with you (.) you don’t know’.

The grandmother, reportedly, contrasts the hypothetical scenario of not knowing with the actual state-of-affairs of Heather’s culpability. Here, the voice of a third party is an effective distancing strategy to justify the family’s position on blaming (‘we wouldn’t have gone on at her’). Again, the temporal ordering of events is crucial in constructing an account of Heather’s blameworthiness. The reflexive statement ‘it just seemed an odd thing to do’ effectively suspends her conduct as anomalous, warranting an account of character. The formulation – Heather is ‘the sort of person who is ignorant of things’ – is a useful strategy to mitigate blame so as to appear concessive rather than overly judgemental. M performs both, firstly, by framing her ‘ignorance’ as an excuse; and, secondly, by implying that Heather is not apathetic or careless (turn 14). However, her anomalous conduct becomes the object of further speculation in the remaining turns. Her ‘intriguing decision’ to have a test forms the basis of alignment with another cousin (Jane), which allows M to subtly index her own responsibility as someone who cannot comprehend Heather’s actions.

# Conclusion

In light of our above discussion we can only attest preliminary observations of how families manage what Novas and Rose (2000) call ‘genetic responsibility’. We have taken genetic responsibility to mean the explanatory frameworks and devices through which other family members figure as participants in the ethico-moral management of genetic information. For us, genetic responsibility is no doubt a macro-political construct, but such a construct has its discoursal articulation in the research interview setting, which has been our focus of attention. It highlights not only the normative dimension in which accounts of risk communication flow smoothly down or across kinship networks, but it also foregrounds alternative, marginal and unorthodox practices of practical ethics. And while this may present a very good case of how misaligned responsibility may not be in the best interests of family members, it also shows how participants produce accounts of self/otherresponsibility that perform, in quite complex ways, what is culturally or ethically appropriate. Stokes and Hewitt (1976) remind us that it is not exclusively the normative dimension of conduct that sustains the moral-political order. Rather it is how problems are repaired or restored (in the sense of offering justifications or excuses, to use Scott and Lyman’s terminology) in the context of everyday situations that provides a more nuanced view of genetic responsibility.

This chapter identifies a number of important points about the patterns of family communication that genetic technologies give rise to. In the case of transmitting genetic responsibility from parents to children, we have seen how parents employ a number of subtle rhetorical devices to confirm a balance between autonomy and responsibility. The use of discourse devices such as character work, event work, constructed dialogue, pronominal reference and contrast allows participants to frame their accounts temporally and relationally, to select events and characterise people and their actions, which serve as means of authentication and comparison in the display of moral versions of parenthood and other familial positions. Strategic recruitment of the voice of the child, for instance, enables participants to convey a ‘dialogic family’ wherein issues are equitably discussed and negotiated. The extracts we selected for analysis are indicative of how the child’s autonomy forms the basis of a coherent moral account of parenthood. Patterns of aligned or deferred responsibility confirm this normative dimension where, at least in the context of research interviews, open communication is either promised or performed. But not all families exemplify the moral ideal of open and inclusive communication. Decisions about testing and/or disclosing test results to children or young people are complex relational phenomena, which pose practical and moral dilemmas for families.

In the case of misaligned responsibility, family members appear to engage in blame for two main reasons: over competing versions of genetic responsibility or over incongruent or disparate understandings of genetics. For example, when disclosure is misaligned between offspring and parents, blaming the parents is a subtle and elaborate activity. The presumed complexity of genetic information/ technology exonerates the parents from having to engage in open discussion about risk. The repeated formulations of (non-)assignment of blame and the proverbial ‘it’s like ignorance is bliss’ are some of the mitigation strategies that excuse parents from genetic responsibilities. A generational aspect to blame allocation is evident here with regard to levels of genetic understanding, in which event work takes the upper hand in comparison to character work. Thus, ignorance on the part of parents constitutes a legitimate excuse. In contrast, lack of genetic understanding as far as the siblings are concerned is dealt with differently as they are held to account for not disclosing carrier status to siblings. Contrasting accounts of disclosure index knowledge as a precondition for reciprocating and exchanging understandings of risk. Formulations of ignorance or indifference on the part of siblings suggest that attributions of character, rather than events, are significant explanatory resources in accounts of failed disclosure.

The moral loading of these competing or discrepant views of genetic responsibility and genetic understandings often entails claiming responsibility for open disclosure while blaming others who fall short in practice. At another level, more subtle rhetorical work is needed not just in terms of the content or the manner in which blame is attributed but how it is exonerated in mitigated and sensitive ways. Our relatively limited corpus does not allow us to claim that there are clear generational circumstances whereby parents are subject to more salient and elaborate attempts to exonerate on the grounds of not understanding genetic risk. Nonetheless, when siblings, cousins and partners are blamed for their ‘ignorance’ and/or indifference, there is noticeably less duty to exonerate. This uneven use of exoneration towards family members is a potentially important finding, suggesting that those who are still active in their reproductive responsibilities are likely to be differentially accountable to managing genetic risk, including open disclosure. By extension, it may also indicate that there is nothing to be gained by explicitly blaming those who have finished their reproductive years and whose life histories cannot be changed.

# 7 Accounts of genetic testing in the clinic

# Introduction

In this chapter, we move to the genetic clinic which families attend when referred by a health professional or through self-referral, in order to discuss issues surrounding genetic testing. As already indicated in Chapter 2, different kinds of tests would give rise to different issues, as would different conditions, patterns of inheritance, family relations, etc. In Chapter 6, our discussion of family accounts involving childhood and adult testing experiences has revealed the nuanced nature of family preferences and expectations, including tensions with regard to individual autonomy and familial responsibilities. In this chapter, we remain interested in issues of autonomy and responsibility from the family perspective, while adding the professional perspective on parental requests for predictive testing of their (young) children. Themes of autonomy and responsibility are always discernible in any genetic counselling session but assume particular significance in the context of childhood testing where there are tensions between parents seeking genetic information about their child and the child’s future right to make his or her own decisions about testing, especially when the child is not present in the clinic. The professional dilemmas surrounding genetic testing and the debates about (non-)directiveness will be addressed in Chapter 8.

We proceed as follows. Beginning with a brief outline of genetic counselling provision in the UK, we provide a summary of relevant studies focusing on communication in genetic counselling. We then draw on a few case studies concerning predictive genetic testing of both children and adults across a range of disease contexts – PKD, familial breast cancer and Huntington’s Disease.1 Using transcribed data extracts (based on audio-recordings of actual clinic sessions) we examine how specific issues of autonomy and responsibility are initiated and responded to by clients and genetic counsellors. As in Chapter 6, we suggest that clients’ and counsellors’ utterances constitute accounts with rhetorical import, coming across as justifications and excuses. In other words, our analytic focus is on how professionals and family members accomplish decisions about genetic testing and (non-)disclosure of test results in a situated manner.

# The ethos of genetic counselling

Since the professionalisation of genetic counselling in the 1970s, there has been an increasing emphasis on conveying not only accurate risk information, but communicating that information in ways that promote competent decisionmaking (Kenen and Smith 1995, Petersen and Bunton 2002). This has occurred against the background of events whereby genetic counselling had shifted from the prevention of genetic disease to the communication of genetic risk (Kenen 1984). Genetic counselling has drawn largely on a psychological model of communication to enhance individual autonomy and encourage risk communication within families.

The phrase ‘genetic counselling’ is employed in many ways and in many different contexts, but comprises two essential components: providing sufficient information about a genetic condition and exploring the personal and emotional consequences of being affected or being at risk. The exploration of personal and emotional issues will often be led by the client but the counsellor may consider it necessary to raise for discussion some possible consequences of the disease or of a decision being made by the client that they may not have already considered. Raising difficult issues in this way may be challenging and uncomfortable for both the client and for the professional, but is essential if the client is to make their decision ‘well’; after all, they may have to live with the consequences of their decision for many years. The focus of genetic counselling, then, is on the client’s process of decision making and not its conclusion: only exceptionally is there an objectively or impartially ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ outcome.

The communicative process of genetic counselling entails first listening to the client to discover their concerns and gain a sense of their level of understanding, their previous experience and background. Then there may be technical aspects to attend to in order to address their concerns, such as ‘What is the diagnosis of the condition in the affected individual(s) in the family?’. If genetic testing is feasible, there may be a process of discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of testing. There may also be practical decisions to be made by the client(s): ‘Should we have any more children?’, ‘Should I have a colonoscopy?’, ‘Should I have prophylactic surgery to remove my colon/breasts/ovaries/thyroid gland?’.

It is standard policy among genetic health professionals not to offer guidance in relation to difficult personal questions but instead to be ‘non-directive’. This enables clients to make decisions in line with their personal wishes and their social circumstances. It has a number of advantages also for the professionals: it gives them a sense of personal distance as well as distancing the profession from the eugenic malpractices and abuses of the past. One rather narrow sense of ‘nondirectiveness’ recommends a largely information-giving role for the genetic counsellor, who steps back to let clients make their own decisions. This simplistic version of non-directiveness fits rather comfortably with a ‘thin’ conception of autonomy as rational decision-making as opposed to ‘thick’ conceptions of autonomy based on a person’s experience, life or values. There are times when adherence to this sense of ‘non-directiveness’ would be inadequate. Not only may clients feel abandoned by this excessive detachment (Bosk 1992) but they may need to be given information that they do not actively seek out, or consider questions that they do not actively raise, in order to help clients ‘to reach a decision wisely, rather than reach a wise decision’ (Shiloh 1996: 87). This ambiguity about facilitating client autonomy may underlie the dissatisfaction of some with the genetic counselling profession’s long-standing and perhaps excessive reverence for non-directiveness (Weil 2003). There is more than one way in which to express the complicated and demanding role of the genetic counsellor.

Kessler (1997, 2000) has made notable contributions to thinking through the relationship between appropriate or inappropriate challenging and influence. Wolff and Jung (1995) have also addressed these questions with great insight in relation to client autonomy (discussed in Clarke 1997b), explaining how a more nuanced sense of non-directiveness leads professionals to help clients to reflect more thoroughly upon difficult decisions. Practitioners may regard this approach to non-directiveness as a more ‘complicated’ or ‘complicating’ attempt to facilitate the client’s autonomy.

Non-directiveness has been especially important in allowing clients to make their own decisions about very sensitive and personal topics – especially predictive genetic testing for incurable disorders and decisions around reproduction. Even in these areas, however, it may be appropriate to challenge individuals to help them think or feel their way through difficult decisions. In other areas it may still be important to do this, as with decisions that health professionals would wish to promote or to discourage. While recognising that the decision is for the client to make, it can be appropriate for a professional to encourage open communication within a family and to encourage genetic testing that may usefully guide practical decisions about medical care (Elwyn et al. 2000). Equally, professionals may feel it is important to discourage predictive or carrier status genetic testing of young children if this could be left until the child is sufficiently mature to participate in the decision. And there may be some requests from a client with which professionals would not comply, such as supporting them in prenatal testing for foetal sex selection. These are some of the hard limits around the sometimes too soft notion of non-directiveness.

Parts of this process have been examined in our earlier study of genetic counselling in relation to predictive testing for Huntington Disease (HD), where we report the efforts of genetic counsellors to engage their clients in a process of reflection upon the possible outcome scenarios of genetic testing (Sarangi et al. 2004; 2005). While some clients do engage readily in this process, others do not – they resist this invitation to enter a ‘reflective frame’, perhaps preferring not to consider an unfavourable result unless or until it arises. Being confronted with such challenges may be difficult for the clients, and at times challenging and uncomfortable for the clinician or counsellor too, but not to raise the difficult facts and questions would be a failure on the part of the professional.

# The structure and process of genetic counselling

Delivery of genetic counselling differs considerably across and within countries (for an overview of the UK setting, see Clarke 1997b). In the UK, the term genetic counsellor is used broadly to include a variety of professional practitioners, ranging from specialist nurses to medical geneticists. Unlike many other counselling/therapeutic settings where clients take centre stage in troubles-telling, in genetic counselling the counsellor spends a considerable amount of time explaining the causes and consequences of a genetic condition, the risks associated with knowing one’s genetic status, the psychological and moral issues concerning decisions to undergo predictive tests and decisions about disclosing one’s test results. The exact remit and duration of sessions vary considerably.

Given the complex nature of topics covered and the ensuing consequences for individual clients and their families, the genetic counselling protocol in the UK for predictive testing of healthy adults at risk of a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, such as Huntington’s disease (HD), is often an elaborate one. Clients are offered a series of sessions over a time period leading up to actual testing, thus allowing them necessary time to reflect on the conditions and consequences of their decision to test or not to test and to disclose or not to disclose their test results. The protocol which has been developed in the context of HD predictive testing underscores this need for adequate reflection before proceeding with a test (see Figure 7.1).

![](img/8a0c0cb940059bd951c8b9a0526a36f031b1f79a4d024c21b9558fded6a27512.jpg)  
Figure 7.1 The process of genetic counselling.

Generally during the preliminary interview, the genetic counsellor articulates the testing process in detail. Here is a typical example (see Appendix for transcription conventions):

# Extract 1

G5: For the testing process we need to see you three three more times (twice) twice to chat about things and once for the results (.) and the whole $[ \dots ]$ process would take about (.) two and a half months (.) to see you first and check through various issues and then (.) we’ll give you a break for around six weeks to think about those issues and any other questions (.) and then I see you for a second time (.) um and then you get the result within two weeks $[ \dots ]$ SO there would be three more visits for you.

As far as the first three sessions are concerned, there are inevitable overlaps with regard to coverage of topics. The protocol usually includes a home visit by a specialist genetics nurse or genetic counsellor prior to the preliminary interview, which is mainly targeted at clarifying the agenda and expectations surrounding genetic counselling. Although regarded as time-consuming and costly in terms of human and financial resources, the home visit serves as a useful platform for the genetic counsellor to provide information about the genetic testing protocol, especially by drawing attention to how genetic counselling fundamentally differs from other mainstream healthcare encounters that the clients are familiar with. The same specialist nurse attends the clinic sessions regularly. The clients are free to decide which of their family members and/or friends choose to accompany them to the clinic sessions.

There is a general concern within the profession that many families and individuals ‘at risk’ do not necessarily access the genetic counselling service. One could say that those who do access the service may come with a consumerist mind set:

‘Since the test is available, let’s have it’; ‘it’s good to know what can be known’. The counsellor’s job then is to make clients aware of the benefits of knowing, while also underscoring the risks of knowing one’s genetic status, both for the individual and for the family as a whole (Sarangi et al. 2003).

With regard to requests for childhood testing, an experienced counsellor (GC10) says the following in an interview:

# Extract 2

GC10: requests for testing of the children, like a lot of other requests for testing, weren’t necessarily requests for testing at all, they were the only way perhaps where people had, it was the way they first, so to speak, phrased their request, but when you went through it in detail you realised that, and they realised that, well they weren’t actually wanting that, they were wanting to go through the issues and as far as possible resolve things and so the great majority never actually got any further, because the people involved realised, yeah, no, it’s not very sensible and were very happy to have had information and realised no, it’s something probably the children will have to make up their own mind about, but there were a few who were very persistent but only a tiny number and, which we didn’t go along.

The low uptake of tests after counselling is often regarded as a good indicator of successful counselling. The counsellor uses both direct and indirect speech to underscore his assessment from the clients’ perspective, epitomised in ‘it’s [genetic testing] not very sensible’; ‘it’s something probably the children will have to make up their own mind about’. The parental responsibility underpinning the decision to test gives way to a recognition of children’s present and future autonomous status. It highlights the fact that genetic counselling is a communication-rich environment, focused on risk explanations and reflections about hypothetical scenarios, which can potentially influence decisional outcomes. In a different interview, another counsellor (GC11) reflects:

# Extract 3

GC11: I know I’ve done this for years and I sort of think, or just anecdotally in my head that actually people need to come to terms with the fact they’re at risk before they think about having a test $[ \dots ]$ and actually one way of not coming to terms with your risk is to say have a test and hope that it’s going to be okay.

For this counsellor, a fuller appreciation of being ‘at risk’ thus becomes a precondition for undertaking tests, especially as many clients tend to anticipate a clear result when requesting testing. This suggests, more generally, that a certain professional agenda exists with regard to what clients need to know, which is likely to guide the counselling process. One can even anticipate a clash of perspectives between clients’ and counsellors’ agendas, especially when clients approach genetic counselling with the expectation that they are not at risk or do not wish to know an adverse result. The same counsellor recounts vividly such a scenario in the interview $\textrm { R } =$ Researcher):

# Extract 4

GC11: when I got him in the room he actually couldn’t sit down either, he was pacing and pacing and banging his head against the wall.   
R: banging his head against the wall?   
GC11: mmm.   
R: okay.   
GC11: and you know I said, well you know (.) and he had his wife with him, and he sat down and he said, do you know the result? or no, I have to remember how this went (.) do you know the result? and we said- and I said (.) well yes, you know (.) sit down and I’ll give it to you (.) and, oh I don’t know whether I want it (.) something, oooh ooh (.) right okay (.) so I was thinking well this is silly now because actually I haven’t told him it’s good news so if I don’t tell him the result he’s going to go away I think maybe assuming that it’s bad news.

The reconstructed dialogue foregrounds the unpreparedness of this particular client to confront the test result, whether positive or negative. Although it may be regarded as an extreme case scenario, this is indicative of people deciding on testing prematurely without thinking through the possible implications. For this counsellor, turning away from the test result can be consequential: ‘he’s going to go away I think maybe assuming that it’s bad news’.

It is rather commonplace for clients to approach genetic counselling with a sense of moral responsibility (i.e., wanting to know one’s genetic status for the benefit of the family), while hoping for a favourable test result. For example, one client (AF) considering predictive testing for Huntington’s Disease, says in a counselling session:

# Extract 5

AF: I mean if it [test result] came back and it was er everything was clear and positive well I mean we could shout it from the hill tops couldn’t we to them ((laughing)) you know (.) but what if it’s the other way (1.0) which I’m well aware of (1.0) quite well aware of that the that there is a possibility (1.0) because I’m fine I’m I’m not that (.) sure of myself that I can go into it and think it’s going to come out that way (.) ‘cause I’m not (2.0) I’m not (3.0) but I’m hh (.) I myself want to know and I’m trying to get around it (1.0).

Here the client admits that a negative test result is not something she is expecting when deciding to come forward for predictive testing. There is, however, ambivalence concerning her ‘wanting to know’, marked by the long pauses and false starts. Once again, this underscores the fact that clients do not reflect fully on the potential consequences of genetic testing, which makes it incumbent on counsellors to explore all possible outcomes, including an inconclusive test result, during the counselling process. In the case of predictive testing for incurable late onset conditions such as HD, even a positive test result is shrouded in mystery with regard to the timing and manner of onset and the course of the illness, while the impact on family relations and other lifeworld issues reveal further complexity.

In the context of genetic counselling more generally, we are dealing with asymptomatic individuals, that is, people who are currently well but may develop an illness in the future or people who are simply carriers, that is, people who may pass on the faulty gene to the next generation without themselves becoming ill. Decisions about testing can be motivated by a number of factors, such as future reproductive options to protect children and grandchildren from inheriting the genetic condition or knowing one’s genetic status per se. A positive test result can raise questions about how to disclose the information to at-risk family members. Even an all-clear, negative test result can have unintended consequences that the client has to deal with. It can pose certain problems for the future, ranging from feeling a sense of guilt to the planning of future tests (Michie et al. 2003). There is also the possibility of an inconclusive result, one that is neither positive nor negative, with its own share of uncertainties. In other words, genetic tests, especially predictive ones, can potentially raise as many questions as the uncertainties they resolve.

Likewise, childhood testing scenarios pose tensions. The parents are likely to portray themselves as responsible selves acting in the best interests of the child, even when deciding to test the child when s/he is not capable of consenting and when deciding to withhold the test result for as long as possible or never to reveal it (Sarangi and Clarke 2002a). As one genetic counsellor acknowledged in an interview, parents are used to taking on a decision-maker role in everyday settings, so it is natural for them to extend this role when it comes to genetic testing of children. It then becomes the responsibility of the genetic counsellor to stress that genetic testing is not like other kinds of decision-making, not even what transpires in a typical paediatric setting. In the case of the genetic testing of children, any possible medical benefits to the child will have to be weighed against a host of other factors, especially concerning the child’s present and future autonomy.

# Overview of communication research in genetic counselling

Genetic counselling is a hybrid activity type (Sarangi 2000, 2006) with elements of information giving, gatekeeping, conventional medical interview, therapeutic/ counselling interaction and service encounter. While it is difficult to impose a rigid structure on a given counselling session, the following components may be taken as indicative (Sarangi 2010c: 405):

Purpose of visit and agenda setting

![](img/509082eb7096049fd09c4765e68be5b0966d0645aea49eade9ab22354342969d.jpg)  
Figure 7.2 Structural map of a typical genetic counselling session.

In thematic terms, a given session may cover a range of topics such as: the natural history of a genetic disorder; levels of genetic awareness of the clients and families, and relationships within family networks; potential advantages/disadvantages of genetic testing; discerning an individual client’s carrier status versus at-risk status versus affected status; (non-)disclosure of one’s genetic status; the (un)treatability of specific conditions; decisions surrounding reproduction; the ethical and legal consequences of decisions made; and privacy issues concerning the circulation of genetic information. Genetic conditions are familial, so a carrier or affected status has consequences for other family members, including future children and grandchildren.

There are rather few studies dealing with the analysis of actual genetic counselling sessions. One of the early attempts is the empirical study by Michie et al. (1997) exploring the theme of non-directiveness in genetic counselling. This study is based on naturally occurring data but the results and findings are presented by using a coding system rather than actual micro-level analysis of extended data extracts. Benkendorf et al. (2001), adopting an interactional sociolinguistic approach, examine in detail linguistic formulations of indirectness, rather than non-directiveness. Sarangi (2010a), based on a close discourse analysis, argues that the issue of non-directiveness is intricately tied up with client-centredness and other-orientedness. Directiveness at the level of interaction and procedure does not necessarily compromise non-directiveness as far as decisional outcomes are concerned. Pilnick (2002a, 2002b) has drawn attention to the ethical nuances of genetic counselling at the interactional level. Empirical studies by Adelswärd and Sachs (1998, 2003), Sarangi and Clarke (2002a, 2002b), Sarangi et al. (2003), Lehtinen (2005, 2007), Lehtinen and Kääriäinen (2005) have explored topics such as expertise, risk communication, information/advice delivery, etc. in genetic counselling interaction.

In reporting the findings of a major discourse analytic study of genetic counselling for predictive testing, funded by The Wellcome Trust (2001–4), Sarangi et al. (2004, 2005) have identified six types of reflective questions in genetic counselling: non-specific invitations; awareness and anxiety; decision about testing; impact of result; dissemination; and other. Decisions about testing and disclosure of test results constitute two main component topics of genetic counselling. A genetic counsellor alerts the client in the following way:

# Extract 6

G5: I think the issues of (0.3) who you tell when you tell (0.4) what you do with the children when you tell your children grandchildren and think they are they are a recurring theme because the nature of the condition $[ \dots ]$ because by its very nature it it’s inherited it affects generations $[ \dots ]$ it’s the most painful area of decision-making \*for anyone\*

Here the counsellor draws attention to the complex nature of decision making by listing a series of wh-questions, which is rhetorically persuasive. This complexity is also stressed by giving it a generic character (‘it’s the most painful area of decision making for \*anyone\*’) the last two words delivered at a slow pace.

As already suggested genetic counselling is normally conducted in an ethos of non-directiveness, which means that counsellors rely heavily on reflective questions (Sarangi et al. 2004) as a way of ensuring clients’ autonomy while assisting clients to make their own decisions and preparing them for potential consequences of any decisions they make at the present time. One can expect misalignments as far as clients’ and counsellors’ agendas are concerned (Sarangi et al. 2005; see also Chapter 6). When it concerns children, we are in the throes of what might be called a discourse of layered autonomy, which is linked to the issue of who constitutes the client of genetic counselling: the autonomy of the parent-as-client may clash with the autonomy of the child-as-client.

Sarangi and Clarke (2002a) present a case study which involves a clinician and a parent discussing childhood testing. The child’s future autonomy is juxtaposed against the parent’s current rights through the use of contrast devices. While the parent generally uses contrast to justify her preference for testing the child, the professional uses it to offer ‘recommended options’ without appearing to explicitly counter the parent’s concerns. Such cases may seem one-sided with parents coming across as self-motivated in seeking reassurance and their peace of mind (see Chapters 6 and 8). But as we will demonstrate in our data analysis section, the family dimension does surface as a key component of decision making when it concerns predictive testing for incurable conditions such as Huntington’s Disease.

In another study, Sarangi et al. (2011) focus on the interplay of biomedical, psychological and sociomoral frames in genetic counselling. The term ‘sociomoral’ draws specific attention to the familial role-relational responsibilities with regard to reasons for testing or reasons for (non-)disclosure of test results, formulated as ‘I think I’d rather know before I decide to have children’; ‘this is done for our family’; ‘the daughter is the first thing I think about’; ‘I would be able to stop the gene and not sort of carry it on through the family’, etc. The case study involves a middle-aged woman at risk of familial breast cancer, who positions herself both psychologically and sociomorally as able to benefit from additional screening, even though the medical evidence and the family inheritance pattern suggest that her risk is no different from that of the general population (which constitutes the biomedical framing by the counsellor). However, towards the end of the session both parties negotiate and agree on additional screening on psychological and sociomoral grounds. The analysis centres on the familial roles and responsibilities that go with individual actions and their consequences (see also Sarangi et al. (in press) on how clients formulate accounts of causal and moral responsibility). A role-relational perspective – how self- and other-oriented responsibilities are framed situationally – helps uncover the nuances surrounding clients’ display of responsibility and autonomy.

One of the dominant themes that has emerged from our previous work on reasons for testing is that knowing is better than not knowing. This line of justification suggests that knowledge is a commodity to be owned and when it involves knowledge about the future, it should impact on decisions at the present time (both for self-governance and for governance of others). Accounts of responsibility and autonomy (see Chapter 4 for a discussion of accounts as consisting of justifications and excuses) come to the fore in the context of decision making.

Our data corpus consists of more than 60 genetic consultations2 held in a clinical genetics service located within the UK, between 1998 and 2004. These consultations were selected for study as part of a broader programme of research in genetic counselling, which was granted ethics approval by the Health Authority’s Local Research Ethics Committee. Eight consultations were held as a joint clinical genetics/paediatric nephrology clinic (on one occasion the nephrologist was not present). Present in the consultations were (usually) the parents of the at-risk children, the two medical consultants and, occasionally, a genetic nurse counsellor. Fifty consultations involved adults at risk of HD who had been referred to genetic counselling services by their general practitioners, or in some cases by selfreferral. Our analysis in this chapter is based on 24 sessions involving 12 clients, selected purposively to consist of 8 pre-result sessions (preliminary, first appointment and second appointment sessions). The findings presented in this chapter are based on the analysis of audio transcripts of counselling sessions. As with the interviews, all identifying information has been removed or altered to preserve anonymity.

# Childhood testing: the case of PKD

Our first extended example is taken from a PKD clinic (jointly managed by a kidney specialist, K1, and a medical geneticist, G1) which concerns childhood testing (for a fuller discussion see Clarke et al. 2010). Immediately after birth, the male child (CM) was scanned but showed no signs of cysts. Following the grandmother’s diagnosis, the mother (PF) was scanned and tested positive. The family has been referred to the genetics clinic by the paediatrician.

# Extract 7a

1 G1 what has anyone said or what do you know about the chances that he might have (.) this kidney problem in the future. 2 PF I don’t think anybody really knows do they (.) is there (.) I d-I say I don’t know nothing (.) nothing about this problem at all (.) I know it like uh (.) like my mother gets back pain $\left[ ( . ) \right]$ and high blood $=$ 3 G1 $[ ^ { * } \mathrm { m m } ^ { * } ]$ $4 \ : \mathrm { P F } \ : = \ :$ pressure things like that but I mean that’s as mu-that’s as much as I know.   
5 G1 right (.) yeah (2.0) so (.) try-there’s several things we probably ough- $\cdot ( . )$ ought to think about then is is the ways in which it can show $( . )$ and also the chances (.) that ((CM)) might have it. 6 PF yeah.   
7 G1 yeah so you’d like to like us to go over both of those.   
8 PF mm.   
9 G1 \*okay yeah\*   
10 PF ‘cause um in when I went to the clinic (.) with ((CM)) they were going to discharge him but when they knew I had polycystic kidneys they didn’t want to discharge him just in case (.) he had it and they did say oh there’s um a blood test that you can have (.) so this is what I want to find out you know do I need to have it done or is it $( . )$ is it not worth it I I dunno.   
11 G1 right (.) okay.   
$1 2 \ \mathrm { P F }$ obviously if it’s going to ‘cause him pain and it’s not (.) ‘cause like it’s not the end of the world $[ ( . ) ]$ polycystic kidneys and I think is it $=$   
$1 3 ~ \mathrm { K 1 }$ [mm]   
14 PF $=$ worth (.) do I really want to know (.) you know will it stop me having any more children if I want any more (.) you know $\left[ \left( . \right) \right] =$   
15 G1 [right]   
16 PF $=$ ‘cause if like ((CM)) hasn’t got it there’s nothing to say that $( . )$ if I have another child (1.0) they won’t have it ‘cause (1.0) you know some might have it you know.

This episode opens with G1 first checking what the parent might already know about the child’s inheritance risk in the future. In turn 2, interestingly, PF first adopts a position of utter ignorance, which she also attributes to others more generally through a rhetorical question: ‘I don’t think anybody knows really knows do they’. In the same turn and in turn 4, PF then begins to display her ‘lay knowledge’ about symptoms based on her experience of her mother’s PKD condition. In turn 5, G1 delineates two interrelated topics to pursue further: the identification of symptoms and CM’s risk of inheritance. In turn 7, G1 creates the interactional space to provide information/explanation. However, in turn 10, PF provides an account in the form of a justification of her decision to come to the clinic and explains what triggered her concerns about CM’s risk status. When narrating the hospital stay, PF uses direct reported speech to characterise the doctors’ offer of blood test (‘oh there’s a blood test that you can have’). This then becomes the reason to find out the blood test is something worth having (see especially the extreme case formulation in turn 12 that PKD is ‘not the end of the world’, which downplays the severity of the condition, assuming the child already has it or develops it in future). PF thus displays her parental responsibility as far as CM is concerned, implicitly suggesting that the test can wait, which is a way of upholding the child’s autonomy. However, there is then a shift in footing as PF voices her concerns about risks associated with future pregnancies, which is part self- and part other-oriented, while acknowledging the uncertainty. In turn 14, she turns the issue on herself – whether the test outcome will influence her own reproductive decision in the future (‘will it stop me having any more children’) – although she quickly admits that the risk remains the same for any future child. What we have here is a genuine inclination on PF’s part to know what can be known before embarking on a testing protocol (see Sarangi (in press) for a discussion of the interplay of moral and causal responsibility). It draws attention to the value of genetic counselling prior to making decisions about testing, including the possibility of not testing (see the earlier quote GC10, Extract 2).

Over several turns that follow, G1 explains the patterns of genetic inheritance and the chance element, possible symptoms, late onset, etc. The discussion then moves to advantages and disadvantages of knowing.

10 PF [mm]   
$1 1 \mathrm { ~ G 1 ~ } = ( . )$ \*yeah\* uh but we wouldn’t say there’s any great rush to do it $\left[ ( . ) \right]$ you know in a child of ((CM’s)) age as long as he’s well (.) $\mathrm { u m } =$   
$1 2 \ \mathrm { P F }$ [yeah]

G1 first outlines the advantages, especially in terms of noticing of symptoms, which is further elaborated in turn 5. Noticing of symptoms can help to seek available treatment, which will enable prevention of further risks. The example offered is high blood pressure as affecting the heart, ultimately leading to the dysfunctional kidneys (turns 3–5). As can be seen, the explanation is formulated more generically (marked by the use of impersonal ‘you’, indefinite articles (‘a child (.) or an adult’), third person reference (‘they’) and vague reference (‘someone’)). The generic style of explanation may explain why PF takes a minimalist participant role. In turn 7, we are offered a contrast structure: no obvious problem at present vs. developing obvious problems in the future. G1 summarises the advantages in turn 9 and explicitly states a stance: ‘it’d be worth someone knowing by the time they’re in their late teens or early adult life’. This amounts to a display of preference for delayed knowing, given the temporal trajectory of PKD, while acknowledging implicitly the future autonomy of the child. As with many other genetic conditions, the tendency may be there, but the onset is far from clear, even through testing. In turns 11 and 13, G1 seems to be more specific in discouraging a test now, but suggesting that the child be followed to check for disease onset with a ‘low-intensity’ surveillance regimen to include occasional monitoring of blood pressure. In turn 14, we have an indication of PF’s display of parental responsibility, which amounts to avoiding potential blame (‘I just wanted to make sure I was doing right by him’).

In the next example, taken from another PKD session, the parents report a history of kidney disease in the family. The father (PF) is already affected as established through a scan when he was in his early twenties following a diagnosis of the condition in his father. Their little daughter (CF) was already scanned after birth and was found to be alright, although this is no guarantee that the girl has not inherited the condition. In the previous extract, the future autonomy of the child is only implied rather than explicated. As we will see below, the child’s perspective is foregrounded. The kidney specialist (K1) dominates the interaction as he spells out the advantages and disadvantages of testing.

This extract shows the predominantly informative character of genetic counselling sessions. Much of the explanation is offered in a generic tone (‘people’, ‘they’) as in the previous extract. The present extract, however, begins with a contraindication as K1 draws attention to the specific disadvantages if the child is tested positive – how ‘it puts barriers up’ and ‘closes doors’ on certain future careers (turns 3–5). These are extreme case formulations indexing professional dispreference about ‘testing very young children’ in a generic sense. K1 then shifts footing in turn 7 to consider the case in hand. He uses the contrast device to stress that CF’s ‘normal’ ultrasound scan result in the past is no guarantee that she does not have PKD or that she will not develop cysts when older (note the formulation ‘it doesn’t (.) absolutely prove that she doesn’t have it because there $i s \left( . \right)$ a possibility that cysts can develop as she gets bigger and [older], turn 7). This formulation then prepares the ground for discussing the advantages and disadvantages of testing vis-à-vis management and surveillance routines. In turn 11, K1 once again uses the contrast structure to juxtapose how a discovery of cysts via ultrasound scan can establish a child’s PKD status giving ‘peace of mind’ (presumably for parents) with how ‘it’s quite important to have a sort of balanced view towards the child’s health and fitness’. Note that K1 continues his explanation in a generic tone which leads to announcing the collective professional stance against testing: ‘we wouldn’t want (.) a child to be (.) prevented from doing normal things because of some (1.0) worry about the kidneys at a stage when the kidneys weren’t causing the child any bother’ $( \mathrm { t u r n ~ l } 1 )$ ). We can see that, although the child’s autonomy is not foregrounded, in K1’s view the child’s perspective outweighs the parent’s unwarranted anxiety. This is an instance of what Silverman (1987) considers to be demedicalisation when the focus shifts to the social constitution of a condition. Again, during such extended generic information-giving sequences the parental contributions are minimal.

A little later, the mother voices her concerns about her daughter’s future reproductive status: ‘I was just worried in case you know if she were ever to want children how that would affect things I mean’ and this leads to further risk explanation and reassurance by K1 that ‘patients with polycystic kidneys appear to be normally fertile … because they are having their families before the cysts are causing them much in the way of symptoms’. This amounts to suggesting a deferral of the decision to test on grounds of reproduction. As far as PF is concerned, however, such a projection to future anxieties on behalf of the daughter underscores the wish to do all she can in discharging her parental role-responsibility, while implicitly absolving herself of potential blame of indifference and/or acting irresponsibly. Here and elsewhere in the session, the professional stance is the dispreference for childhood testing especially as the test results can be inconclusive and the cysts will not develop until much later. Monitoring or constant surveillance (to control blood pressure and urinary infections) might be the way forward as far as children with a family history of PKD are concerned. The explanation constantly shifts between the specific case and the general scenario concerning PKD, which is perhaps meant to reassure the parents that, on balance, not testing is better than testing. These considerations need to provide the necessary conditions for actual decisions about testing or not testing. Parental responsibility and their right to know are acknowledged as normal, while underplaying blameworthiness.

The discussion of the above two families shows that parents account for their preference for testing their children in various ways, while the medical professionals are eager to foreground the limits to what can be known and in what ways a child’s future autonomy can be compromised by childhood testing. In other cases, parents come with a more determined attitude and demand testing in the best interests of the child: ‘we were wondering whether or not he could be diagnosed now so that we know and we can, you know, look towards his future’. It seems the ‘best interests of child’ justification can be used both as a basis for testing and for delaying testing. What is often implied in such a position is of course the parental right to know and to seek a sense of reassurance. It is up to the counsellors to underscore the lack of medical benefit for the child, in addition to ethical concerns surrounding the child’s future autonomy. The counsellors foreground the risks involved in testing a child, especially in terms of lost autonomy and the right not to know, including the possibility of differential treatment accorded to the child with a positive test result (see Clarke et al. 2010 for a fuller discussion of childhood PKD testing). Given the young age of the child, the communication process between parents and children does not assume topical salience.

# Adult predictive testing: breast cancer and Huntington’s Disease

In this section, we consider the adult predictive testing scenario, including at-risk parents, to see if issues of responsibility, autonomy and blame feature in the same way as in the case of childhood testing. In choosing to focus on breast cancer and Huntington’s Disease (HD) our aim is to see if notions of responsibility and autonomy are played out differently given that medical intervention is possible in the case of the former while the latter is incurable with the only possibility of management of symptoms.

In the following example, the client (AF) attends the clinic for a preliminary interview with the genetic counsellor (G4) and the specialist nurse (N3) (as it happens her partner chooses to wait outside). AF already has breast cancer but is worried about it spreading to ovarian cancer, while also being concerned about transmitting the risk to her children.

2 AF: [yeah]

19 AF: yeah.   
$2 0 ~ \mathrm { G 4 }$ : yep (.) and outside of that (.) any other peripheral issues or.

$3 2 \ \mathrm { G 4 }$ : $=$ to be at risk of breast cancer so much.   
33 AF: mm.

In the opening sequence, G4 passes the floor to AF to set the agenda for the session, which AF readily accepts. In turns 4–6, she explicitly confirms that her daughter is the reason for her to undertake the test. This is followed, in turns 10–12, with a voicing of her concerns that the cancer might be familial (‘it’s gone right down through’) while putting her case aside from the general population risk. AF supports her anxiety by talking about her aunt and cousin. In turn 14, we see her formulating a strong position on behalf of her daughter: ‘I think my daughter has a right to know and take precautions when she’s about forty’. AF has undergone chemotherapy and continues her screening protocol following her own diagnosis. As a responsible parent, she wants the same provision for her daughter. It is interesting that action on the part of the daughter is delayed until she is forty, which has implications about disclosure of AF’s genetic status. However, given that this is a preliminary interview, the issue of disclosure is shelved. In the following turns (16–18), G4 offers an interpretive summary reinforcing that CF’s risk status is the main reason for AF’s undertaking testing at the present time. When asked for any other peripheral issues, AF mentions her concerns about her son’s future children – again assuming parental and grandparental responsibility – while displaying her awareness of breast cancer in men. Once again, G4 summarises this concern.

This is followed by a long discussion of the family tree, patterns of risk inheritance and the issue of uncertainties surrounding test results, with G4 emphasising that ‘even having a negative result doesn’t completely remove the possibility of CF having a genetic predisposition’ although ‘it would still be good news’. In response, AF repeats her earlier stance: ‘in hindsight she [CF] should really start going for screening when she’s about forty’. Nearly 27 minutes into the session, G4 asks N3 to raise any further issues.

31 N3: [it is it is] :um and in a way (.)

What we have in the above extract is a fine line between parental responsibility and the possible sense of guilt if the results were to prove positive. N3 initiates the topic of guilt and prefaces it with what happens in other cases (turn 5). AF’s position is a firm one, as evident in turns 06–10: that her genetic status is not her fault and that she will not feel guilty whatever the test results, which is reinforced again in turns 12–14 by aligning her daughter with her own thinking (‘my mind doesn’t work like that neither does my daughter’s’). In terms of character work, both mother and daughter have shared traits. In turns 16–18, this unwarranted sense of guilt is contrasted with the pragmatics of knowing, the latter leading to responsible action (‘if she does develop something it can be picked up very very early’). In what follows, N3 again draws parallels to how other people feel guilty about the outcome if it is not favourable, which only receives further rebuttal from AF (24–28).

Towards the end of the session, G4 extends the topic to include AF’s husband’s (MP’s) perspective. As indicated earlier, MP chose to stay in the waiting area than join the clinic.

33 G4: yeah? yes.

$4 3 \ \mathrm { G 4 }$ : fine [‘cause] I mean it would be nice just to know that (.) 44 AF: [yeah] yeah.

Throughout this session, AF has presented herself as a ‘fairly strong minded’ decisive person, as G4 suggests in turn 1 and as we have seen from the previous extracts. This is explicit character work, which contrasts starkly with the mother in the PKD case who is inherently ambivalent (see extract 7a). It is possible that parents may display ambivalence when it concerns childhood testing as opposed to testing themselves for the benefit of the child (see also the HD case below). It is noteworthy that genetic professionals such as G4 here feel the urge to explore every possible dimension surrounding a decision to test. Here MP’s absence in the clinic does not go unnoticed; rather, it becomes a topic of focus (an observation rather than a criticism, turn 5) against the normal expectation (turn 7) that clinic sessions are attended by partners and family members. This triggers an account, in the form of a justification from AF, that MP ‘hates hospitals’ and even challenges G4 to verify this. In turns 13–17, G4 stresses that the issue under discussion would affect them as a couple. In what follows, AF successfully infers the potential accusation that they may not be discussing the issues as a family and reports the extensive nature of communication that has taken place between herself and MP (see Chapter 6 on dialogic families and aligned responsibility). In turn 23, G4 feels a disjuncture which is not voiced so explicitly: if MP is so involved in the discussion it is odd that he does not actively participate in the clinic session. This prompts G4 to draw parallels with other people (‘sometimes people staying out there in the waiting room is actually because they find it so difficult to come to terms with’). AF is quick to dismiss this inference and affirms that her husband has come to terms with the current testing scenario. As we can see, G4 continues to display a sense of doubt $( \mathrm { t u r n ~ } 3 1 $ ), especially with regard to how MP would respond to a positive test result, i.e., if CF had inherited the faulty gene. In turn 32, AF switches the topic slightly to focus on the daughter and the distant future with the promise of a cure, which amounts to saying that MP is firmly behind the decision to test and has come to terms with a possible positive test result. The discussion then concentrates on how a positive test result can only be a good thing in terms of future screening provision. At the end, G4 wants to be reassured that MP is kept informed about both the reasons and consequences of testing.

In the case of adult predictive testing for Huntington’s Disease (HD), even where a cure is no more than a remote possibility, the right to know prevails, again for the sake of one’s (future) children rather than for self-monitoring/ surveillance and management of symptoms, as is the case with breast cancer above. Doing something for the children’s sake becomes both a psychological necessity and a moral duty. The genetic professionals, however, would like to hear that clients come forward for predictive testing, especially for incurable conditions such as HD, for their own sake rather than solely to fulfil their parental/familial role-responsibility.

The case below concerns a woman in her twenties (AF) who has grown up with HD in the family. First her grandmother, and now her mother have been affected. She is the youngest of four siblings, and the other three have had their tests (two positive, one negative). As AF and her husband (MP) are considering having children, she wants to find out her HD status and, if found positive, make use of pre-implantation diagnosis. AF also has other medical problems, including depression for which she is under treatment. Extract 10a is taken from the beginning of the First Appointment clinic.

29 AF: um ((MP)) was a friend of my brother’s for years er before we got together (.) and he knew all about Huntington’s you know um (0.5) but it’s (.) I’ve had long talks with people you know and they’ve said it must be really hard not knowing and everything else (0.5) but it’s (0.5) you know it (.) all the years of (.) sitting there thinking well this is what it would be like if I’ve got it this is what it would be like if I haven’t and everything else you know I I would like to know.   
30 G5: mm.   
31 AF: you know (.) probably make me feel a lot better in myself whatever the result is.   
32 G5: mm.   
33 AF: knowing that I’ve got the test out of the way.   
34 G5: yeah.   
35 AF: and I don’t have to think about it (.) popping up in the future or wherever else you know.   
36 G5: mm.   
37 AF: even though you know depending on the result (.) knowing I’ve got the test over and done with probably make me feel a lot better.   
38 G5: so the actual thought of (.) the test and the process is in itself (.) that’s an issue aside from having the result.   
39 AF: yeah.   
40 G5: yeah?   
41 AF: yeah (.) er (.) I’m probably more more scared of like (.) the testing than the results.   
42 G5: what this part.   
43 AF: yeah ((laughs)) ((all laugh))   
44 AF: yeah yeah alright if I’ve got it you know fine I can handle that but um (1.0) it’s it’s sort of like sitting there going through all this probably the scariest part to be honest.   
45 G5: yeah (.) \*yeah\* (1.0) BUT ODDLY enough actually in one sense that’s that’s part of the reason for it isn’t it.   
46 AF: yeah.   
47 G5: ‘cause it’s if you think (.) it has this slight effect of sort of inoculating you know bit by given you the thought (.) it’s trying to prepare you \*for

coping afterwards\* (.) and there is something about experiencing some of the anxiety at this stage that actually makes it easier to deal with later um (.) (it may sound very) bizarre but um.

$4 8 ~ \mathrm { M P }$ : (^^^) most of the fear before it actually comes.

$4 9 \ \mathrm { G 5 }$ : that’s right it’s sort of facing it all before you actually have to face it in reality but er (.) there is that rehearsal which is why we do it.

G5’s opening turn with the preface ‘in the midst of all this’ refers to AF’s current treatment regime concerning depression following discharge and her progress with the pain management clinic. In response to G5’s question about her thinking on undertaking HD predictive testing, in the following turns (2–6) AF expresses a positive attitude on behalf of both herself and her co-present husband, expressed through a blending of personal and collective pronouns. She affirms that a lot of discussion has happened and that the timing is right, despite the other medical problems she has been encountering recently. In turn 8, there is shift from the preparedness for undertaking testing to the reasons underlying such a decision, which is formulated as wanting to know now on the pretext of having children, summarised in turn 10 as ‘so it would be good to know which way to plan our future’. At this stage AF, and perhaps G5, are expecting a kind of endorsement from MP, which is not forthcoming. MP’s laughter in turn 14 is a bit unsettling, which leads to a question seeking confirmation from AF (‘it’s true though isn’t it’) that receives a soft acknowledgement. In turn 17, AF reiterates the joint thinking that underlies this timely decision to go ahead with testing. In turn 20, G5 recalls the reasons for testing from the previous session, which happens to align with what AF has said here. G5, however, ends this turn by fishing for other reasons (‘is it more than just the children’), which is an indirect way of looking for a more preferred reason, at least from the professional perspective.

In turn 21, AF latches on to this invitation and offers a different reason (‘I would like to know just for me’), repeated also in turns 23 and 25, as a way of putting a stop to the uncertainties, effectively captured in ‘have I haven’t I what if I have what if I haven’t’. Given that her three siblings have had their tests done, it seems there is a family expectation that she should also follow suit. Indeed, as we can see in turn 23, AF has lied to her mother that she already had a test and the test results were negative. She now wishes to set the record straight and is prepared to confront her mother and family with the real test result. In what follows, AF provides a further basis for her decision to test by recruiting the views of friends and others – to know now what can be known is a far better option than not knowing or knowing in the future. Thus the temporality dimension of knowing overrides the outcome of the test result itself.

In turns 37–49, a contrast is drawn between going through the testing process and coping with the test results. AF’s formulation, ‘I’m probably more more scared of like the testing than the results’, comes as a counterpoint as far as G5 is concerned, given that most clients embark on testing without much thought and without much knowledge about the testing process. Against this backdrop, the genetic professionals invite clients to reflect on different possible results. As far as

AF is concerned, she seems confident that she can ‘handle’ the result, but finds the decision to test the ‘scariest part’. This could partly be explained by the fact that she has been exposed to HD all her life, with so many family members already affected. As we have seen in turn 23, she has lied to her mother about having undergone the test, which is further testimony to her fear of testing. In turns 45–47, G5 characterises the testing protocol as an ‘inoculation’ in preparation for what is to come, including the experiencing of anxiety. It is interesting to note that this stage of the process is considered a ‘rehearsal’, which is juxtaposed to the coping of test results as being ‘real’.

Until now, the discussion has centred around AF’s wanting to know and having to cope with the testing protocol. The earlier reason for testing for the sake of future children emerges again, first in relation to her affected sister, in the final extract below.

# Extract 10b

1 AF: (.) um but I wish my sister ((sister name)) had done it before her kids (1.0) that’s going to be I know that’s going to be very hard to sit and watch her go through that with her kids you know (.) knowing that she’s got the gene and knowing that (.) you know she can’t do anything until they’re eighteen so (.) that’s going to be very hard but I you know said to my sister (.) that if in that respect (.) um (.) and I’ve seen how ((brother 2 his partner)) have done it with the pregnancies (.) and at first it sort of really (1.0) disgusted me you know that (.) they were doing it and then when I (.) we actually sat and talked about it (.) and it was me who said when we look at it from the the other point of view (.) and we sat and talked about it and we saw and made me realise the sense in it all (.) um so yeah (.) I am (.) sort of glad in a way that I’m the last one to (.) go through it.

2 G5: mm.

3 AF: ‘cause I have seen (.) how they’ve all done it and how they’ve all coped er (.) and I know (.) whether I’m the first relative to go through it or the last relative I know (.) you know ((brother 1)) and ((sister)) will be there so if I ever need to sit and chat (.) \*so\*

4 G5: .hhhh what about the issue of of children (.) is it that you’ve sort of (.) thought it through in a stepwise progression (.) now I’m going to have my test and then we’ll do this and then we’ll do this or is it that it is an issue of both wanting to have children and we’d want to know first so I’m going to have the test and then we’ll take it from there.

5 AF: (both of us really) because we want to have children er (.) w-as far as we’re concerned it’s for the better um (.) but we’re both very much (.) adamant that we would like to know the result before we have children.

6 G5: mm.

7 AF: um (.) because I don’t think.

8 G5: mm.

9 AF: I’d want to go through what my sister and my mother have gone through (.) you know knowing.

10 G5: yeah.   
11 AF: that that your kids (.) will have it ‘cause when my mum found out that ((brother 2)) had it (.) er really (.) you know (.) took her apart.   
12 G5: mm.   
13 AF: um so (.) I can imagine (.) in a way what ((sister’s name)) going to be like with her kids.   
14 G5: mm.   
15 AF: (I don’t think) I’d (.) I’d want to go through that.   
16 G5: mm.   
17 AF: so (.) yeah we we would like to find out the result and.   
18 G5: and then come back and talk about options when you’ve had the test (.) if it turns out.   
19 AF: well if (.) if I’m positive then we would still have children but we would (.) um have the the test done same as ((brother 2)) ((brother 2 and his partner)) (.) said (just out there) (.) I’d like to know a bit more about that.   
20 G5: right.   
21 AF: and how that all works.   
22 G5: right (.).hhhh in one sense all of that can (.) be the other side of the testing rather than muddy the waters with more information than (.) than we need at this point in ‘cause in a sense your decision to have testing’s made anyway.   
23 AF: yeah.   
24 G5: and we can still talk about that if we need to (^^^).   
25 AF: okay.   
26 G5: giving time to let the ripples subside if it turns out.   
27 AF: yeah.

Both AF and G5 use constructed dialogue and contrast devices throughout to talk through some of the sensitive matters surrounding testing before or after pregnancies. Earlier (see the breast cancer case) we have noticed how genetic professionals draw on other people’s experiences in a generic way to inform the decision-making process. In this case, AF chooses to draw on the experience of her familial others (sister, brother and mother, all of whom have affected status), especially in relation to timing of the decision to test and the testing of embryos as is the case with her brother’s family.

In turn 1, AF offers a negative evaluation, expressing her dispreference, of her sister’s decision not to test before having children and how this oversight is going to prove hard to bear until the children attain the age of eighteen. AF then contrasts her sister’s scenario with that of her brother and his partner who are planning pregnancies by testing each embryo. At first, AF regards it as ‘disgusting’ but after a series of talks comes to realise the reasoning behind such decisions. She now has the benefit of familial others’ experiences and coping strategies, and this has no doubt put her in a better position to deal with her own situation.

In turn 4, G5 enquires more specifically about AF’s strategy, using constructed dialogue, to see if there is a sense of logic to their current and future actions. This is followed by AF, as at the outset of the session, that both she and MP want to have children ‘but we are both very much adamant that we would like to know the result before we have children’, unlike her sister and mother (turns 9–11) but like her brother. This will help to avoid the consequences her mother had to endure and what awaits her sister. A positive test result would not deter AF from having children (19), and in that case she would explore the various options at a later time, which G5 acknowledges.

# Conclusion

Although participants in a genetic counselling session could be thought of as partners progressing together through a shared agenda and process towards an agreed end, this may not always be true; misalignments and tensions are then likely to emerge. Clients may approach the counselling service expecting a smooth sailing through the testing process, especially when they may have spent a considerable amount of time thinking through the reasons for and consequences of their testing decisions. We have evidence from the family accounts in this chapter and also in Chapter 6 that at-risk clients behave responsibly when seeking genetic testing. In the case of childhood testing and prenatal testing, they justify their action as being undertaken for the sake of their children. The genetic professionals, however, may be generally cautious as they want to make sure, and make visible, that clients have a deeper understanding of the circumstances and implications of testing and the likely test results.

Knowing one’s genetic status ‘here and now’ so as to be able to prepare for the future emerges as a reason frequently employed by clients to justify testing in these clinic encounters. This shows that most parents, and clients more generally, emphasise the benefits of knowing at the expense of the risks of knowing – the latter becoming a key point for the counsellors to foreground during the consultation. It is also commonplace that genetic test results may be understood as conveying certainty, and that clients expect a clear-cut result, even when testing is only able to suggest likelihood, with a risk figure cast in terms of probabilities. Thus, as evidenced by one parent’s formulation: ‘if you could turn around and tell me one way or the other or whether or not he has polycystic kidneys or not’. Generally, clients request testing in the anticipation of a negative test result, which can lead to obtaining ‘reassurance’ and ‘peace of mind’. The counsellors deliberately place some emphasis upon the possibility of a positive test result, which needs to be entered into the decision-making equation. The fact that there is always at least a third possibility – the possibility of no result or a grey zone, indeterminate result – is usually not entertained by clients prior to making a decision about testing. The precision of a predictive test will often vary between diseases, with the precision of testing for HD, for example, being greater than in the case of PKD or breast cancer, but still not 100 percent in that an intermediate zone of uncertainty does occasionally arise between favourable and unfavourable results.

In conclusion, it seems that the default stance for parents is to know what can be known, especially when regular check-ups and treatments are available or for the sake of possible treatment in the distant future, in preference to not knowing. They seem to be able to provide compelling accounts of coping with knowing – whatever the test result – than not knowing. In family terms, it seems a dialogic family configuration can be advanced as a reason for testing as well as the ‘need to know’; in turn, knowing what is there to be known would facilitate openness of communication, although this is not generally true of all family accounts. Parents appeal to what they authoritatively know about their children and it is through such character work that they provide justifications for knowing. Blameworthiness is implicit – to do otherwise, that is to choose not to know, amounts to indifference, bordering on irresponsibility. Individual responsibility is variously enmeshed with parental and other familial responsibilities, both with regard to the decision to test and decisions about disclosure (compare for instance the ambivalent parent in the PKD case with the determined parent in the breast cancer case). The best interest of the child assumes rhetorical significance, although children can be used as a shield in parental accounts of predictive testing. There is allusion to dialogic families, with open communication within the family, as seen in our discussion of family interview data in Chapter 6.

The genetic professionals see it as their responsibility to explain all possible scenarios, including aspects of uncertainty following testing and, as we have seen, a possible sense of guilt if the test results were to be positive. With regard to childhood testing, the professionals routinely construct prospective versions of autonomous children to engage in delicate negotiation of how best to protect the child’s autonomy in the case of future surveillance (as in the case of PKD). When adults are seeking predictive testing for HD, the professional preference is to make clients reflect and reassess their reasons for testing by suggesting that the consequences of testing for one’s self must not be glossed over and forgotten, even if the primary reason for testing is for the sake of one’s children.

While professional explanations about patterns of inheritance and risk status are formulated more objectively, albeit with mitigation, decisions about testing and the disclosure of test results are typically framed generically, with comparisons made to other cases. In addition, the genetic professionals see it as an imperative that they explore the perspectives of absent others, including the children for whom testing decisions have direct consequences, and spouses and siblings. Professional preferences and dispreferences are signalled with adequate warrant and the portrayal of other scenarios, including hypothetical events, facilitate this process. Family circumstances are bound to differ and the scope of the clinic consultation is restricted severely with regard to how thoroughly it is possible to weigh up all possible perspectives to arrive at a consensual and preferred option. In the case of the breast cancer consultation we have discussed here, the counsellor admits: ‘sometimes people say one thing before they have the gene test and then actually have a different thought after the gene test and it can go either way again’. This comment at once reflects the ever-fluctuating motivation surrounding clients’ decisions to test and the ambivalence that characterises the professional stance within the constraints of the genetic counselling process.

# 8 Professional accounts of ethical challenges in the prenatal genetics clinic

# Introduction

Health professionals have always discussed ‘difficult’ or ‘challenging’ cases that arise in the course of their work. For genetic counsellors, these will often include cases where difficult ethical issues are raised in relation to genetic testing. In this chapter, we look at difficult cases that have arisen in the prenatal genetics clinic. While some of the issues are specific to the prenatal context – decisions about continuing or terminating a pregnancy – the prenatal clinic presents a wide range of other ethical problems involving emotional tensions and interpersonal conflicts for families and sometimes professionals. For instance, the question of whether to continue with or to terminate a pregnancy itself entails implicitly expressing a view on what constitutes a worthwhile life and what degree of personal, parental commitment to the foetus is appropriate.

The chapter is structured as follows. First, we provide a conceptual framework for examining professional ambivalence concerning difficult cases in genetic counselling. We then consider five cases brought up for discussion by professionals in interviews or in a practitioner forum that raise ‘ethical challenges’. All of these challenges revolve around the question of influence: what degree of influence is legitimate for a professional to exert over a client, or for others (e.g., partner, family or friend, etc.) to exert over a pregnant woman? Should a professional intervene when their client appears vulnerable to the influence of those around her, or is that beyond the scope of the professional’s so-called neutral role?

# Ambivalence surrounding professional ethics in practice

Broadly speaking, difficult issues arise in the prenatal genetics clinic for two reasons: when establishing the appropriate grounds for seeking a termination of pregnancy and when considering the impact of genetic testing on relationships within the family system (Sobel and Cowan 2000). Weighing up whether or not to pass on unwelcome information to other members of the family can be extremely difficult for genetic counselling clients (Forrest et al. 2003, Hallowell et al. 2003, Featherstone et al. 2006), but clients’ decisions can also generate dilemmas for genetics professionals. For instance, professionals may seek to persuade their clients to disclose important information to their family members, while only very rarely forcing disclosure themselves (Clarke et al. 2005). Indeed, the way in which information is given and how the issues are framed to the client can be challenging even when competence is not in doubt and there is no reason to question the validity of a client’s consent. We have to recognise that the way information or questions are framed will often convey implicit values and expectations as to how the listener should respond to information or questions (Tversky and Kahneman 1981). In the context of counselling for HIV/AIDS, this has prompted a discussion about information being intended and/or understood as advice (Silverman 1997). Such difficulties often arise for genetic counsellors when discussing predictive genetic testing with older teenagers and young adults (Gaff et al. 2006). Difficult cases are often framed as ‘communication problems’, ‘ethical issues’, and difficulties in the ‘interpretation of policies’ or even questions about clinical ‘professional judgement’.

We have previously discussed the challenges faced by paediatric and genetics professionals when parents request predictive or carrier status genetic testing for their (young) children (Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2009). We have used the same approach in this volume to examine the ways in which professionals formulate cases in the prenatal genetics clinic. In that paper, we argued that case formulation is a display activity that reconstructs characters and events in ways that seek to justify decisions in clinical practice. Family members, for instance, may be cast as praiseworthy if their behaviour complies with professional expectations or as blameworthy if their behaviour appears misaligned with the practitioner’s expectations. This highlights how professionals interpret and apply ethical guidelines in situ, and how ethical guidelines are themselves recruited as rhetorical devices for justifying ‘good practice’. While acknowledging their ambivalence, our analysis pointed to the fact that the operation of professional judgement is not a simple matter of implementing ethical principles but also managing their interactions with parents and children.

Studies in North America have reported on the types of problems causing concern among genetic counsellors there (McCarthy Veach et al. 2001, Wade and Wilfond 2006). Less has been published in the UK on these matters,1 but the value of ethics discussions in maternity services has been reported (Alderson et al. 2002). It is also important to recognise that professional difficulties will be seen through the lens of professional expectations of what their role entails. The definition and scope of genetic counselling are of central importance in setting these expectations, and hence in recognising the perceived difficulties arising in practice, i.e., distinguishing the ‘routine’ and anticipated problems from those that are not routine and are more difficult to manage. The recent redefinition of genetic counselling in North America is highly relevant to this, with the balance between ‘education’ and ‘counselling’ being a crucial issue (McCarthy Veach et al. 2007).

Another relevant concern among professionals is the centrality of the ethos of non-directiveness, which some regard as too passive or as a distraction from the ‘neutral’ orientation of genetic counsellors to the psychosocial dimension (Weil 2003). While non-directiveness certainly includes the judgement that professionals should not lead clients to make specific, predetermined decisions, its scope can be much broader. A more sophisticated form of non-directiveness can be seen to remain central to the ethos of genetic services as being more active in character than the negative framing of the concept itself. Non-directiveness can involve challenging clients with uncomfortable thoughts so as to engage the complexity of decision making (Wolff and Jung 1995, Clarke 1997b, Sarangi et al. 2004). Also relevant to the ethos of a genetics service is its willingness to develop personal relationships with its clients. The building of relationships with the genetics professionals is central to the concerns of clients (Skirton 2001, McAllister et al. 2008) but is not always valued adequately by managers. The inability of professionals to establish the relationships they value with their clients then becomes a problem for the professionals who may become dissatisfied with the standard of care they are providing.

Finally, and more generally, there is the issue of balancing the ‘wide’ and ‘narrow’ range of responsibilities that clinical geneticists and counsellors have towards their clients. In the course of being confronted with ethical tensions between their responsibilities to individual patients and to other family members, genetics professionals are required to make important moral judgements (Parker and Lucassen 2003). Rather than appealing to formal ethical guidelines or prescriptive policy, it may be better for geneticists and genetics teams to develop their own ethical reasoning in ethics committees or forums. In the UK, Clinical Ethics Committees (CECs) are not widely used by genetics health professionals;2 more often they use the ‘Genethics Club’ as a forum for discussion (the first case we present in this chapter was discussed in such a forum).

# Accounting for cases

The practice of discussing difficult cases with professional colleagues is a particular form of storytelling and accounting widely used among medical professions. Sociological accounts of ‘case presentation’ have explored these forms of talk as serving a broad range of moral and social purposes, in addition to monitoring professional judgement. For instance, Dingwall (1977) has described the practice of telling ‘atrocity stories’ as ways of asserting and defending the rational character of health professionals. Anspach (1988: 358) has shown how the presentational aspects of case talk among trainee physicians are not merely activities of objective reporting, but forms of professional socialisation that can reveal scepticism towards patients. Case presentations frequently eliminate judgement from medical decision-making and employ rhetorical devices to enhance the credibility of their findings. Hunter (1991) has drawn attention to the narrative organisation of doctor’s accounts of patients whereby patients’ stories are often reconstructed as vehicles of medical education and understanding. Atkinson (1995) has argued that for stories to count as cases, they have to be presented in a highly specific framework of episodic and temporal markings.

The practice of case presentation is also a moral activity in which professional competence and responsibility is displayed (Atkinson 2004). While research interviews constitute a kind of ‘confessional space’ for ethical reflection and moral reasoning, the rhetorical work of case presentation is constructed with the expectation of defending one’s position from potential criticism. This is strongly related to the interpersonal distance between interviewer and professional in the research interview, and the speaker and audience in case presentation; one would not expect an interviewer to directly challenge the competence or authority of the participant in a research interview. Of course, one of the purposes of case presentation is to debate and discuss challenging cases with a view to improving professional knowledge and practice.

# An example of ethical accounts in childhood genetic testing

We now give a short example of a problematic case from our previous work, to illustrate how cases are discussed in research interviews (Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2009). In the following example, a genetic counsellor (GC) is discussing a difficult case involving a ‘very aggressive, pushy’ father who ‘presented himself at clinic demanding that [his] children have carrier testing’ for cystic fibrosis.

Extract 1 $[ \mathrm { G C } = 0$ Genetics Professional; R = Researcher]

R: simply because he’s demanding it (.) it makes it awkward for you or?   
GC: I think not that he’s demanding it so much (.) that’s apparent (.) maybe it’s because he’s not doing what we think he should.   
R: right.   
GC: maybe it is as simple as that.   
R: right.   
GC: but it’s-I don’t think he’s taken time to recognize (.) looked at himself and his need for doing it.   
R: yes.   
GC: It’s a huge control issue.   
R: I see.   
GC: and why is that important to me? And I don’t know because it is a bit of a struggle (.) there’s part of me that wants him to recognise that what he’s doing actually is about control (.) it’s about his own anxiety and it actually isn’t about the benefit of the children (.) is my belief (.) now I might be wrong. (Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2009: 180)

It is worth noting that GC uses the ambivalent formulation (‘maybe it’s because he’s not doing what we think he should’) not only to display reflection about a difficult case, but to signal a tension between professional judgement and clients’ everyday practice. For GC, it is not the ambiguity of forming a moral judgement that is the problem but convincing the father to comply with ethical protocols of genetic counselling. This shows her awareness of the possible conflation of ethical issues with difficulties in the interactional sphere. This is an issue of power rather than moral reasoning, one that is aggravated when professionals are pressured to endorse family decisions or disclosures or when dissuading anxious and persistent families from seeking ‘inappropriate’ genetic tests.

Case exemplars such as the above highlight tensions between professional judgement/responsibility and parental rights/autonomy. In difficult cases involving the testing of children, parental right/autonomy is often foregrounded to justify decisions which comply with particular ethical guidelines. However, there are other tensions that emerge in which the line between professional responsibility and individual or family responsibility remains blurred and unresolved. The ‘case study’ – often reducing the complexities of family relationships and professionalclient interactions to a mere paragraph – is the preferred format for reporting such cases in bioethics (Chambers 1999). Oral presentations are more widely used among practitioners and may allow a more nuanced account to be given through interaction between the speaker and the listeners. Whatever the medium employed, however, exemplars serve to display professional uncertainty and ambivalence about cases in which the ‘best interests’ of competing parties are difficult to discern.

# Cases from the prenatal genetics clinic

Professionals were recruited from paediatric and genetic services in the United Kingdom. Both convenience and snowball sampling were used to contact professionals who, by either academic reputation or clinical experience, had worked on cases involving family and childhood testing. Senior professionals were selected who had a long-standing experience of cases involving genetic testing and/or genetic counselling. The sample included paediatricians $( \mathbf { n } = 1 0$ ), clinical geneticists $( \mathbf { n } = 2 )$ ), and genetic counsellors $( \mathrm { n } ~ { } = ~ 8 )$ ). Professionals were asked to provide retrospective accounts of difficult or challenging cases along the following lines: explanations of their ethical reasoning and orientation about matters relating to the competence and maturity of children; the problems of disclosing risk in families, the practical and ethical differences surrounding predictive and carrier testing; and the difficulties of practising non-directive counselling. In total, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted to capture sufficient variation and complexity of ethical cases.

In addition to research interviews, we also recorded a preliminary meeting involving a group of professionals gathered to discuss ethical issues in clinical genetics. The meeting was held at Oxford in November 2001 to examine the difficulties that arise in genetic counselling practice in the UK and to consider how such difficult cases could be dealt with. This meeting led to the establishment of the UK’s ‘Genethics Club’, a forum held three times a year. The benefits of including professional group discussions demonstrate how professionals construct ethical issues in their own terms and according to their own occasioned social practice (similar to case presentations in medical settings as discussed above). Permission to include material from the transcript of the meeting was obtained from the organiser and from the individuals who raised specific topics or cases.

Ethics committee approval was sought prior to the recruitment phase, and in the case of professional interviews multi-centre approval was obtained.

We now present five cases for analysis and discussion. It is important to remember that these cases have been raised because they are difficult and unusual; they do not represent standard practice, although they might be extreme or otherwise unusual variations on a common theme.

# Case one: foetal sex selection and cultural difference

The first case is drawn from the practitioners’ forum. It reports discussions that had occurred among the clinical and laboratory professionals in a UK clinical genetics centre when it was feared that a couple from a minority ethnic community might be ‘taking advantage’ of prenatal diagnostic testing. The specific case deals with prenatal diagnosis in respect of a serious sex-linked disorder, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), that is usually diagnosed in boys at around 4–5 years of age and results in the inability to walk by 8–12 years and then death typically in the late teenage years or twenties. At prenatal diagnosis, the sample would usually be tested first to determine the foetal sex and, if the foetus is male, a specific test would be performed to determine whether the boy would be affected. The carrier status of a female foetus would not usually be determined.

the case which presented particular challenges to our department was of a Muslim couple from south Asia who had a son with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (.) came to the department (.) requested prenatal diagnosis in the next pregnancy and said that if the pregnancy was female they wanted to know whether or not the daughter was a carrier as they would only wish to continue pregnancy (.) if it was a female (.) if the daughter would (be) known not to be a carrier because they were concerned about the marriage-ability (.) of a daughter who was a carrier with Duchenne (.) and clearly that raised all sorts of (.) problems for (.) us (.) and after a lot of discussion we decided that (.) whereas our normal practice with prenatal diagnosis for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is to let people know the sex of the pregnancy very quickly because that information becomes available within 24 hours and then only to con-proceed with molecular tests if the pregnancy is known to be male and therefore (with) the risk of being affected with Duchenne (.) we decided to consider the possibility for this couple we would not reveal the sex of the pregnancy (.) we would simply say the pregnancy was affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or it was not (.) and within the category of it not being affected there were three possibilities (.) it might be an unaffected male (.) it might be a carrier female it might be a non-carrier female (.) now the people in the laboratory had some concerns about holding information in the lab and not giving it to us because as it was one of my cases but the consultant genetic counsellor had been talking to this couple about that (and) they would not be able to cope if they knew more information than was to be passed on to the patient (.) and so they asked the laboratory to keep the sex of the pregnancy confidential (.) the alternative seem to be that we might say (.) the department might say (.) to the couple that we don’t feel to able to offer prenatal diagnosis to you because of the restrictions and because of the use we fear you might put the information to (.) leaving them to find someone else (.) in fact the discussion with the couple was always complicated by the fact that the woman was bilingual speaking both Urdu and English (.) whereas her husband and his family and she they lived with her husband’s parents only spoke Urdu (.) one of our consultants is also bilingual and so she saw the family but what would happen from time to time during the consultation (.) was the woman would deliberately swap from Urdu to English so that she could make her comments that her husband (.) and her parents-in-law would not understand (.) and she felt speaking to a Pakistani consultant that therefore the consultant should be able to understand the pressure she was under to have a son (.) and that therefore was hoping to elicit some sympathy for her dual aim: one to have a child who didn’t have eh Duchenne muscular dystrophy and secondly to have a son (.) and as time went by it became apparent that she didn’t really want to just avoid having a carrier daughter (.) she actually didn’t want to have a daughter at all (.) the offer that was made to the family was the more limited provision of information simply that the pregnancy would-they would be told whether the pregnancy was affected or not (.) and they accepted that and went ahead with pre-prenatal testing on that basis however (.) shortly after the result came out which was that the pregnancy was not affected with Duchenne (.) they went on holiday and and it would appear whilst in Pakistan had an ultrasound scan establishing that the pregnancy was female and had a termination.

The family is presented by GC as ‘a Muslim couple from South Asia’, which establishes category membership with a society that often prefers sons to daughters and often practises arranged marriages. The couple would like to know whether the foetus, if female, carries the family’s DMD gene mutation. GC engages in further category work by imputing concern about the eugenic aspects of arranged marriage: ‘they were concerned about the marriage-ability (.) of a daughter who was a carrier with Duchenne’. This allows GC to present the ethical dilemma at hand as perfectly natural and self-evident: ‘clearly that raised all sorts of (.) problems for (.) us’. The inference is that termination of a female foetus who is a carrier of DMD is too close to the termination of female pregnancies on social grounds because of a preference for sons, which runs contrary to the guidance of the General Medical Council. A joint solution between the laboratory and the clinical team is worked out to ‘not reveal the sex of the pregnancy’. However, this requires convincing ‘the people in the laboratory’ that the clinical team ‘would not be able to cope if they knew more information than was passed on to the patient’. GC is claiming that the clinical team would not feel comfortable withholding information that they knew, presumably out of a sense of loyalty or responsibility to the family.

GC justifies the decision to withhold information from the family by showing that the ‘alternative’ of refusing prenatal diagnosis might lead them to ‘find someone else’. Event work establishes that the consultation with the couple was ‘always complicated’ by the fact that her husband and her husband’s parents, who were also involved, only spoke Urdu. The combination of character and event work allows GC to construct a scenario in which ‘the woman would deliberately swap from Urdu to English’ to surreptitiously communicate ‘the pressure she was under to have a son’, thus positioning the clinic team as an ally. Establishing that the pregnant woman was being coerced by the family justifies the decision to provide limited information. Furthermore, the reconstruction of events also establishes that the ‘offer’ to withhold information of foetal sex was consensual: ‘and they accepted that and went ahead with pre-prenatal testing on that basis’. Thus, a temporal account of (past) characters and events seeks to justify the professional ethical stance, while mitigating the blameworthiness of the clinical team.

A number of commentators (not all included here) refer back to this case during the forum, drawing attention to different issues and strategies to criticise the decision presented by GC. The first commentator draws attention to the evident lack of ethical guidelines in forming a professional judgement.

# Extract 2b

1: I thought your case is very interesting and I thought-sort of a comment and a question (.) a comment coming from your first case with the Muslim couple (.) was that it seems to me whatever you think the rights and wrongs are (.) surely can’t be right that it’s up to whether that couple gets the can or cannot be tested (.) or their child tested for whether she’s a carrier like you said for muscular dystrophy (.) shouldn’t be up to just your individual ethical feelings out of context from everywhere else (.) especially from outside the clinical genetics world there should be some consistency across the country rather than it being up to that (.) it also seems to me that there’s potentially a big gap between the kind of restriction that you give to couple’s ability to have a termination of pregnancy compare them with the social terminations of pregnancies that are absolutely part of normal obstetrics practice (.) so it seems me there’s a huge gap there which from sitting on the outside seems very bizarre (.) and I suppose looking to the future where I imagine that couples will be able to get as ((Chair)) was saying internationally but even locally one would be able to find out all the information that you now hold of this couple and their pregnancy (.) in twenty years time I could imagine this discussion will look very strange that we considered withholding information that people can get by self tests.

The response from C1 refers to the case not in terms of the events or characters that were so important in justifying the decision, but by foregrounding the role of professional judgement. This is explicitly marked by pronominal reference (‘you think’, ‘your individual ethical feelings’, ‘you now hold’), which reconstructs the case in terms of an individual decision based on local circumstances and emotions. By contrasting the decision with an unspecified superordinate category (‘everywhere else’), C1 is claiming that individual decisions are disorganised and contingent as opposed to ‘some consistency across the country’. This allows C1 to develop the claim that there is no consistency (‘there’s potentially a big gap’) between judgements about ‘normal’ terminations based on social reasons (i.e., unwanted pregnancies) and abnormal terminations based on cross-cultural reasons (i.e., sex selection and marriage-ability). This comparison is effective in showing the arbitrary nature of in situ decisions that operate ‘outside’ of broader ethical frameworks.

The other criticism we have included here focuses less on the normative grounds of professional judgement and more on the exceptional limits of professional responsibility:

# Extract 2c

listening to both your (^^^) and your presentation (.) interesting how you view as clinical geneticists your professional limits and that is on what you’re responsible for (.) cos ((it)) seems to me you consider yourself responsible for an awful lot down the line (.) and I wonder where that comes from (.) for example (.) I mean if I went to my financial advisor to find out what pension I would have if I retired now (.) I wouldn’t expect the financial advisor say well (.) I must think that if I told you that information he might go and commit suicide because his financial status isn’t as in (.) good-in as good position as he might think (.) you think that’s not for the financial advisor to double guess (.) the financial advisor is to tell me honestly what my financial state is (.) similarly if I went to a lawyer to find out if I had a case for something or other (.) I wouldn’t expect the lawyer to double guess what I might do with the information (.) again (.) the lawyer is to give me the unbiased correct truthful information about my legal position (^^^) based position (.) now it seems to me one potential (interpretation) (.) one description of the clinical geneticist is (.) if I come (.) or if my partner comes pregnant and wants information about the foetus (.) the sex of the foetus (.) or any of this other information (.) then that information is for you as clinical geneticists to give (^^^) whether it’s in the National Health Service or wherever (.) but (.) but then the question about whether I then seek a termination of pregnancy (.) or my partner seeks termination of pregnancy (.) could be seen as (.) well that’s up to the obstetrician and the grounds of the Abortion Act ((to)) give for termination of pregnancy (.) it’s not for you as clinical geneticists to say (.) I’m not going to tell this information about the (.) about the foetus or I am (.) but that’s clearly not how you see it and I’m intrigued by why does that enormous (.) how you dec-(.) how you come to where you are in terms of professional responsibilities?

In order to highlight the unusual responsibility of clinical geneticists, C2 uses both character and event work to contrast two familiar professional roles: the financial adviser and the lawyer. The presumed similarity of these roles is based on the transaction of information between professional and client. In the first example, C2 constructs the extreme case of the financial advisor who withholds financial information on the grounds that it might cause possible harm (i.e., suicide). In fact, the unlikelihood of such a scenario indicates that professionals should not ‘double guess’ what is in the best interests of the client. More importantly, however, whether or not the information causes distress, the professional has no (legal) right to withhold such information. In the case of the lawyer, emphasis is placed on objectivity and fulldisclosure, which are normative expectations of the professional-client relationship. Having defined the professional role via analogy, C2 shows that withholding information about the sex of the child is in violation of this contractual relationship. Clinical geneticists have an obligation to disclose all the information, and not to ‘double guess’ what the client might do with that information: ‘that’s up to the obstetrician and the grounds of the Abortion Act give for termination of pregnancy’.

Both criticisms take up a position outside the clinical genetics profession to highlight the unusual practices of gatekeeping that appear to encroach on individual rights. The exceptional range of powers and responsibilities of the genetics profession is partly related to the belief that genetic information is itself exceptional, and therefore unlike financial or legal information. Yet, with respect to withholding information from clients, one ‘technical’ response has to be that a woman who has undergone prenatal diagnosis has the legal right to be given the full set of results, whether or not they have all been placed in her Clinical Genetics file. So she has the right to them even if they are only present in a laboratory scientist’s notebook. This point was not made in the discussion but is clearly central to developing policy for dealing with such issues.

Given that Extract 2a exemplifies a case in which a decision to withhold information from a couple regarding the sex of the foetus is clearly a directive one, from a rhetorical point of view it is worth asking what kind of account can persuade the audience of an ethics forum that the right decision has been made. What resources do they use to convince the audience? Broadly speaking, there are five kinds of justification work embedded in the account: (i) to raise suspicion of sex discrimination by establishing ethnic category membership; (ii) to use such inferences to convince those present in the forum that the laboratory team had grave concerns about both the potential misuse of information about foetal sex and the withholding of information from the clinical team; (iii) to meticulously reconstruct characters and events to establish the coercion of the mother; (iv) to recruit the couple’s consent that information would be withheld; and (v) to provide confirmatory evidence that justifies their initial concerns about sex selection (i.e., the pregnancy was later terminated in another country).

Despite the elaborate defensive work, the criticisms we included here clearly show that the decision to withhold information is a difficult one to defend. By invoking categories outside the genetics profession (i.e., other professional roles and expectations), it is possible for commentators to show that inferences about ethnicity and sex selection are biased and may not be legally sustainable. On the other hand, the collusion of UK health professionals with foetal sex selection would raise the question of serious professional misconduct. There is no easy solution to this quandary.

# Case two: professional expectations in prenatal diagnosis for Huntington’s Disease

The second case we present for analysis was raised in the course of a research interview with a clinical geneticist. This case looks at the sole context in which genetic counsellors will regularly seek to persuade a couple not to proceed with prenatal diagnosis unless they are fully committed to terminate the pregnancy if the test result is unfavourable. This would happen when a foetus at risk of Huntington’s disease (HD) is shown to have inherited the mutation. In the extract below, the clinical geneticist is giving a strong account of the expectations and responsibilities of both professionals and clients.

# Extract 3 [CG $=$ Clinical Geneticist]

CG: before you organise a test for Huntington’s prenatally you really go through with the couple that it is expected that if this foetus is affected you will be terminating (.) that is the difference between pre-natal testing for Huntington’s and most other genetic disorders (.) that is because if you do not terminate you are doing a pre-symptomatic test on a child if you continue (.) it’s very important that the couple realise what they are getting into (.) it’s not saying (.) I haven’t considered that until the test is done (.) you can’t do that (.) it’s not fair (.) certainly not fair on the couple (.) you can’t be paternalistic about it (.) they have got to hold their responsibility and they have got to hold their uncertainty (.) I know that sounds really strong but they can’t consent (.) they can’t give informed consent (.) if you haven’t gone through these things and it is hard for couples (.) when I am teaching I have got one of those cartoons with two doors and the devil saying damned if you do and damned if you don’t because they are wanting these pregnancies (.) they are not unwanted pregnancies (.) they are much desired and wanted you know and it’s just really hard for them but they need to be responsible and they can’t hand that responsibility over to a health professional (.) that’s very dangerous opportunistic if a health professional wants to do that.

There are several assumptions that frame this clinician’s ‘strong’ account of professional and client responsibilities. The first is that if a couple seek a prenatal test for HD then they are effectively asking for a pre-symptomatic test on a child. The guidelines in the UK are clear – no such testing should be offered until the child is mature enough to make their own informed decisions. In order for the unborn child to make such an autonomous decision, the couple would have to defer testing and relinquish their right to know whether the foetus is affected or not. This relates to the second assumption: the genetics profession does not endorse a pregnancy if the test reveals that the foetus is affected; however, they do endorse, and indeed insist upon, the right of the couple to make their own informed decision. This brings us to the third assumption: that couples may not understand the practical or moral consequences of what they are requesting in this situation.

From a rhetorical perspective, CG softens the expectation to terminate the affected foetus by obscuring the agent in the statement: $\cdot _ { i t }$ is expected that if the foetus is affected you will be terminating’. It is not clear who is making this expectation, though it is implied that it comes from the genetics profession, and probably will be marked as such in the clinic setting. The justification for termination is based on existing guidelines about testing children. This is a strategically interesting move: CG is able to construct an effective justification for professional practice based not on complex moral reasons of what constitutes a worthwhile life, but in terms of existing principles that protect the future autonomy of the unborn child. In other words, it is the principle of autonomy that provides the injunction or ‘expectation’ for termination. Deflecting explanations for termination to existing guidelines spares genetics professionals from having to give complex and potentially controversial arguments to justify professional practice.

For CG, the central issue is how to elicit informed consent (‘it’s very important that the couple realise what they are getting into’), which is not about simply communicating information to the couple, but eliciting responsibility in relation to the complex issues outlined above. She recruits the hypothetical voice of the client to show that consent to a test that was not informed (‘I haven’t considered that’) is professionally irresponsible (‘you can’t do that (.) it’s not fair, certainly not fair on the couple’). The claim ‘you can’t be paternalistic about it, they have got to hold their responsibility and they have got to hold their uncertainty’ captures the central tension in this account. The practitioner is describing ownership of (‘hold their’) responsibility and uncertainty as an imperative (‘they have got to’). The task of professional responsibility is to actively instil this obligation/uncertainty in the couple. CG engages in hedging to mitigate what might otherwise be construed as directive counselling (‘I know that sounds really strong’) to justify that informed consent is not simply the state of knowing something, but owning or experiencing the ambivalence that comes with making complex decisions. In the context of predictive testing for HD, some clients will resist the invitation to engage in this type of reflection (Sarangi et al. 2005), but as CG points out: ‘they need to be responsible’. This is strongly contrasted with handing responsibility over to the ‘health professional’, which seems to imply that other professionals engage in ‘dangerous [and] opportunistic’ practices of counselling. Here, the directiveness of the counsellor and the non-directive ethos of genetic counselling would seem to be compatible with what Clarke (1997b) calls ‘appropriate directiveness’. This is partly because the complexity of the case demands informed consent (‘it’s very important that the couple realise what they are getting into’), and partly because counsellors will not make decisions for their clients (‘they can’t hand that responsibility over to a health professional’).

# Case three: concealing non-paternity

Problems can arise in the course of prenatal diagnosis when the diagnostic test generates information about both biological parents of the foetus. There can be a mismatch between the genetic test result of the foetus and that of the putative father. The usual reason for such discrepancies is false paternity. There have been debates among professionals about how this situation should be handled. While some have argued that professionals should be ‘straightforward’ with both ‘parents’ (Lucassen and Parker 2001), in practice professionals usually collude with the mother.3 They will (usually) ensure that the woman knows the true situation but will then conceal the truth from the woman’s husband or social partner, although this means that they are complicit in his deception and the partner may be left with false beliefs in relation to whether (or not) he carries a particular autosomal recessive disorder.

The case presented in Extract 4 is an example in which the professional colluded with a woman to conceal the fact that her partner was not the father of her child. This is not an especially unusual case as most genetics practitioners do not see it as their role to introduce ‘truth’ and ‘clarity’ into personal relationships, especially if it is likely to jeopardise those relationships and make less secure the upbringing of current or future children. One of the key points to appreciate in this case is that men affected by cystic fibrosis (CF) are almost always infertile as, in male patients with CF, the vas deferens fails to develop properly.

# Extract 4 [GC $=$ Genetic Counsellor; R = Researcher]

1 GC: we do actually inadvertently do paternity testing (.) it’s happened to me twice now.   
$2 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : hm mm (.) hm mm.   
3 GC: where we had a gentleman who had CF himself (.) his wife was a CF carrier.   
$4 \mathrm { \textrm { R } }$ : yeah.   
5 GC: so (.) and the baby didn’t have any mutations.   
6 R: hm.   
7 GC: therefore clearly it couldn’t be his child (.) I mean (.) it was really quite unlikely.   
$^ \textrm { \scriptsize 8 R }$ : oh (.) I see.   
9 GC: that it was his child (.) anyway (.) yeah-so he had one (.) but (.)   
$1 0 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : so what do you do in that situation?   
11 GC: well (.) he was so excited about the pregnancy.   
$1 2 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : yeah.   
$1 3 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : he really was and er (.) his wife was like- and she (.) I gave her opportunity to talk to me separately.   
$1 4 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : $\mathrm { { h m } \ h m \ m m m }$ .   
$1 5 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : and she didn’t (.) she still maintained he would be the father.   
$1 6 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : stuck to the story (.) yeah.   
$1 7 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : exactly (.) and so when I gave the results (.) I just said (.) I’m delighted to inform the baby hasn’t (.) has not got-is not affected.   
$1 8 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : okay.   
$1 9 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : and he assumed therefore it would be a carrier (.) ‘cos that was the only good news that he could have had in their scenario and I (.) and she looked at me and she knew.   
$2 0 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : she knew.   
21 GC: she knew but (.) er (.) we managed (.) you know (.) but she was prepared to put that baby through a CVS which is a-mm (.) you know (.) an early test with at least a (.) with about a two percent miscarriage rate.   
22 R: that’s right.   
$2 3 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : one in fifty (.) she was prepared to do that even though she probably knew that baby was not at risk.   
$2 4 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : for goodness sake.   
$2 5 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : but that maintained her family unit.

In response to R’s question in turn 10, GC signals sympathy with the husband and implies that it would be difficult to disclose probable non-paternity (‘well (.) he was so excited about the pregnancy’). This is contrasted with ‘his wife’ who is cast as deliberately avoiding the ‘opportunity to talk to me separately’ (turn 13). The inference that the wife is prepared to conceal this fact from the husband is confirmed in turns 15 and 16. The practitioner is implicated in the deceit through her silence, by not explaining to the partner that the foetus was neither affected nor even a carrier of the condition. Aside from moral concerns about non-paternity or professional concerns about collusion, it also raises more serious consequences for the unborn child. Turn 19 is the critical moment of the account whereby the husband is allowed to assume that the child ‘would be a carrier’, while the genetic counsellor and the wife exchange ‘knowing’ glances: ‘and she looked at me and she knew’. While we are already oriented to find the wife blameworthy for numerous reasons, in turn 21 it is developed more strongly in relation to the welfare of the child. The claim ‘but she was prepared to put that baby through CVS’ (with the associated 1–2 percent risk of miscarriage) imputes culpability and negligence; that she would risk the pregnancy to ‘maintain her family unit’.

This case demonstrates that non-directiveness is sometimes an ‘unsatisfactory’ situation in the case of non-paternity – not because of the presumed infidelity of the wife, but because the counsellor was placed in a position of (implicitly) colluding to withhold information from the husband. Blame is apportioned indirectly by describing events (‘I gave her opportunity to talk to me separately … but she didn’t’) in which the wife appears to be ‘taking advantage’ of the counsellor’s role. Further blame work establishes that the consequences of collusion are more serious for the child and more uncomfortable for the counsellor. Thus, establishing blameworthiness through character and event work is central to identifying the limits of non-directiveness where ‘doing nothing’ might result in collusion and jeopardising a pregnancy.

# Case four: persuasion by the husband

This case concerns a reciprocal chromosomal translocation. Such a translocation involves a physical exchange between two chromosomes, with a part of one chromosome being exchanged for a part of another.4 This may then complicate the production of gametes and lead either to miscarriage or to the birth of a child with serious problems of physical and/or cognitive growth and development.

Extract 5 [GC $=$ Genetic Counsellor; R = Researcher]

1 GC: and they are more likely to miscarry $( . )$ and they feel very guilty that they’re putting this on the partner.   
$2 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : yeah.   
3 GC: and everything else (.) and it leads to a lot of problems and it led to a lot of problems where we had a trans(location carrier) (.) you know (.) they’d gone through infertility (.) that’s where they found the translocation in the first place (.) so.   
4 R: right.   
5 GC: the precious pregnancies (.) they came and we discussed it all and in the first pregnancy it was an immense amount of counselling (.) I must have seen them every few weeks (.) but we-they decided they just couldn’t put this pregnancy at risk and fortunately that child was born with a balanced translocation.   
6 R: okay.   
7 GC: next pregnancy (.) the mother said no I was (.) she’d really appreciated that she was lucky.   
$^ \textrm { \scriptsize 8 R }$ : yeah.   
9 GC: so she wanted an amnio (.) but the father who is the translocation carrier absolutely didn’t want it (.) and put so much pressure (.)   
10 R: didn’t want the amnio?   
11 GC: no.   
$1 2 \mathrm { ~ R ~ }$ : why?   
13 GC: because he didn’t want to chance (.) the risk of miscarriage (.) and put huge pressure on the mother not to have it.   
$1 4 ~ \mathrm { R }$ : right.   
$1 5 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : and eventually she succumbed and said no (.) we won’t have an amnio and that child was born with an unbalanced rearrangement and had severe problems.   
16 R: oh God.   
$1 7 \ \mathrm { G C }$ : and at that of course (.) the mother had a nervous break-a breakdown (.) so it doesn’t work now (.) and it was just so sad and I even wrote in my

letter which is unusual for me (.) quite strongly saying (.) this decision (.) you know (.) you have persuaded your wife to ((laughs)) to not have (.) something (.) you know (.) something quite strong (.) you know (.) but if you change your mind I will be delighted to organise it ((laughs)) and not (^^^^^) because I knew it was not her decision and she was very uncomfortable and that has then rebounded now so she (.) she really resents him have-(.) stopping her having the amnio when she asked.

18 R: and how does he feel?

19 GC: guilty (.) yes (.) he is guilty (.) yeah (.) but you know so much so that mm (.) the (.) you know (.) there was talk about him giving up work and looking after the child.

GC has been explaining the genetics of translocation carriers and how pregnancies are ‘more likely to miscarry’, which leaves women ‘feeling very guilty’ about the uncertainty this puts on the partner. In this extract, she narrates an ironic morality tale where the guilt is reversed. She begins by describing a case where the couple had ‘gone through infertility’, underscoring not only the ‘precious pregnancies’, but also the amount of professional work involved: ‘an immense amount of counselling’. The intense investment (‘I must have seen them every few weeks’) may explain the slippage of pronominal agency for the decision to decline prenatal testing: ‘but we-they decided they just couldn’t put this pregnancy at risk’. This subtle formulation of interest not only implies that the counsellor played an active part in supporting the decision making, but that her involvement had paid off: ‘and fortunately that child was born with a balanced translocation’.

The experience of the first pregnancy is used as a frame of reference for the mother’s preference for testing in the second pregnancy: ‘she’d really appreciated that she was lucky’. In the first pregnancy the risk was worth taking, and the same would be considered a responsible action in the second pregnancy. However, the casting of characters and events in turn 9 apportions blame; for instance, we hear the mother’s decision to have ‘amnio’ as manifestly responsible, which is contrasted with ‘the father’ who is cast as biologically ‘responsible’ (‘who is the translocation carrier’) and coercive (‘and he put so much pressure’). The apportioning of blame to the father warrants an account, which R seeks in turns 10 and 12. GC’s explanation provides opportunity to intensify blame: ‘and put huge pressure on the mother not to have it’. The decision not to have prenatal testing proves to be a bad one (‘and the child was born with an unbalanced rearrangement and had severe problems’), the sadness of which is confirmed by R’s exclamatory reply in turn 16.

In turn 17, GC describes the unfortunate effect of the pregnancy on the family but also her rather unusual attempt to avoid this situation. Her description of writing a summary letter after the consultation reveals starkly directive language (by her own admission) about the husband’s persuasion of his wife. The use of reported speech (‘but if you change your mind I will be delighted to organise it’) adds real-time emphasis to her unsuccessful intervention. She attempts to exonerate herself from the potential charge of being ‘directive’ in her counselling by claiming knowledge that the mother was indeed coerced, and was feeling ‘very uncomfortable’. She also marshals further knowledge of the mother resenting her husband for ‘stopping her having amnio’, which intensifies blame and vindicates GC’s decision for seeking to persuade the husband. Thus, directiveness in genetic counselling is permissible when character work is used as a contrast device to establish the blameworthiness of ‘the father’ and the vulnerability of ‘the mother’.

This episode demonstrates how a genetics professional may wish to influence the client to help her make her own decision; this amounts to a very active attempt to facilitate the client’s autonomy. It also raises the question of whether or how a practitioner should police the persuasive activities of family members: it would be unreasonable to expect family members to behave as if they were practitioners bound by the constraints of non-directiveness, but what standards of fairness should family members observe? And, should professionals support their clients against undue pressurising from family members or others? While it would clearly be improper – contrary to professional codes – for a practitioner to seek to persuade the woman in such a personal matter, is it any more legitimate for the woman’s partner to do so? And should the professional simply accept such an intervention by the partner or should they intervene to support the woman?

# Case five: persuasion by medical professionals

Finally, we turn to a complex case where paediatricians have requested that a woman carrying twins have an amniocentesis to see if one foetus, which had multiple malformations apparent on ultrasound scan, had a chromosome anomaly that would warrant a decision not to resuscitate at birth. Where the previous example was concerned with disagreements within the family, in what follows we explore disagreements among professionals. The genetic counsellor gives an account of other health professionals attempting to persuade the pregnant woman to agree to prenatal diagnostic tests:

# Extract 6 $[ \mathrm { G C } = \mathrm { C }$ enetic Counsellor; R = Researcher]

1 GC: $\mathrm { m m } \left( . \right)$ we once had a case of a twin pregnancy where one of the babies had anomalies (.) very serious anomalies (.) and one didn’t.   
2 R: right.   
3 GC: and the paediatricians said they wanted the woman to have pre-natal testing to look for ((a chromosome anomaly)) (.) they thought this was what the affected twin was likely to have (.) and we said well (.) there’s no point (.) why have (.) we’re putting the other twin at risk (.) it’s norm-it looks (.) appears normal.   
4 R: yeah.   
5 GC: you know for the genetic (.) for the genetic advice (.) we weren’t referred the patient (.) we just didn’t (.) you know (.) in a joint MDT ((multidisciplinary team meeting)) (.)   
6 R: $=$ sure.

From the genetic counsellor’s perspective, how should the conscientious professional behave in these circumstances? At what point should the professional intervene to prevent a colleague from another specialty behaving in a manner that contravenes professional standards within genetic services? To what extent does the genetic counsellor’s code apply to others? It appears that the paediatricians were arguing the case for an invasive diagnostic procedure that could jeopardise the chances of survival of the other twin, on the grounds that only a confirmed genetic diagnosis in the twin with malformations would ensure that a decision not to resuscitate was a ‘legally safe’ position. Our interest here is the accounting practices GC employs to foreground the paediatricians’ disputable motivations for testing, which appear more concerned with potential litigation than maintaining the best interests of the mother and the healthy twin.

In turn 7, GC frames the dilemma in terms of inappropriate testing. The pronominal ‘we’ speaks on behalf of the genetic counselling unit, orienting to contrasting views of appropriate testing across professional boundaries. Furthermore, the use of reported speech and modalisation (‘we said well $[ \dots ]$ this baby is highly unlikely to survive anyway’) establishes that there would be no point testing if the child’s survival is unlikely in any case. The rhetorical question in turn 8 (‘why are we putting the second twin at risk?’) persuasively restates their position as a challenge that demands an equally persuasive explanation. In turn 9, GC marshals further resources to undermine the paediatricians’ ‘inappropriate’ request. First, she establishes that ‘we’ (the genetic counselling unit) were actually supporting the mother (‘this was the mother’s feelings as well’), which rules out the suggestion that the dispute was motivated by inter-professional differences. Second, and more effectively, she gives a detailed description of the reasons why the paediatricians were seeking a test: ‘they were going to have to resuscitate and try to save this baby (.) they wanted the information prior to delivery’. The formulation ‘were going to have to resuscitate’ already implies that this was not what the paediatricians wanted to do. She describes ‘the sort of er (.) fear of (.) investigation’ as a vague motivation for testing. The paediatricians were seeking information that would remove the burden they experienced of an obligation to resuscitate the child contrary to the wishes of the parents.

R seeks confirmation that the reason why the paediatricians were requesting amniocentesis was to avoid criticism, or even prosecution, over the failure to resuscitate the child (turn 10). GC’s extreme formulation (‘well there was no reason (.) honestly’) conveys strong commitment to the belief that there was no adequate justification for pressuring the mother and for placing the life of the healthy twin at risk. Just how an underlying genetic diagnosis would provide stronger grounds for a decision not to resuscitate an infant against the wishes of the parents is unclear. In presenting something of a non-reason (‘but I think there must have been something in their back of their minds … ’) that could underlie an otherwise incomprehensible decision, GC imputes a powerful criticism that implies a self-serving interest to avoid controversies over professional competence rather than supporting the mother.

In response to R’s question about ‘the outcome’ of events, GC explains that the baby’s death raised further problems regarding ‘the recurrence [of] risk’. Because a post-mortem was not performed, it was not possible to establish a precise genetic explanation for death: ‘so we’ve got nothing’. She blames this unsatisfactory situation on ‘the breakdown in communication with Paeds and [the mother]’, which is an implicit contrast to the ethos of genetic counselling, which had always ‘supported the mother’. In this way, we can see that ethical problems in professional practice are recast as morality tales. We, the listener or observer, are oriented to hear this tale as a preventable situation whereby professional concerns about accountability and blame (i.e., legal reprisals) interfere with establishing good communication and trust with the client. Here, the blameworthiness of ‘the paediatricians’ is established by orienting to the contrasting motivations for genetic testing: the paediatricians are concerned about legal accountability, while the genetic counsellors are concerned about the mother’s autonomy. The use of character work and extreme formulation by the genetic counsellor must establish that there is ‘no reason’ for persuading the mother to have a test.

# Conclusion

Professional ambivalence about cases that involve genetic testing is not so much the ambiguity that arises from competing ethical concepts such as ‘autonomy’ and ‘beneficence’. Rather, ambivalence arises from the domain of practice, from the practical difficulties of negotiating competing interests and relationships that complicate the counselling process. The limits placed upon professional judgement are rarely about the pure undecidability of such cases, but the difficulty of managing power relations in which the knowledge of genetic testing has different implications or ‘effects’ for each of the parties involved. The difficult task for the genetics professional is to ensure that the person for whom the outcome of a test is an embodied concern (i.e. the mother) is making a decision free of coercion and based on knowledge about the complexities of what they are asking for, even if such knowledge is complicated and uncomfortable.

The cases we presented in this chapter take us on a tour of some of the most difficult but recurrent problems that arise in relation to genetic testing. These include issues of (non-)directiveness, professional and familial pressure, respect for cultural and religious differences and decisions about when it may be legitimate for a professional to withhold information from a client. We have shown that professionals often use case-based accounts to develop an ethical position that they can adopt and defend, and that pure reflection upon the relevant principles is not as useful as the preferred approach to thinking through ethical decisions and challenges.

The cases we have presented and analysed in this chapter are inevitably atypical. While they are not representative of the everyday practice of prenatal testing, they do expose some of the limits and variations of professional responsibility among genetics practitioners. A dominant theme that runs through all these cases is the problem of maintaining an ethical boundary between directive and non-directive approaches to counselling. As we have seen, genetics professionals maintain this boundary by strategically employing accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame. But the cases we have examined also show that genetics professionals are not the only people to exert an influence in the prenatal clinic. Other characters – the husband, the husband’s family, allied health professionals – play a complicating role in the decision-making process. Often the figure of ‘the mother’ is placed at the centre of these accounts, while other characters play a prominent role in persuading her to have or not to have genetic testing. In such accounts, extreme formulations are used to upgrade inferences of persuasion to that of coercion so as to justify the protective role of the genetic counsellor. A distinct characteristic of these kinds of accounts is the use of blame to undercut the reasons or intentions of characters who influence decisions in the prenatal clinic. Establishing the husband who uses ‘unreasonable force’ and the paediatricians who use ‘unreasonable reasons’ as blameworthy are just some of the rhetorical strategies we have seen used to advocate and protect the mother’s autonomy. Of course, complementary to blaming the directiveness of others is to affirm the non-directiveness of oneself. One effective way of showing the lengths that a practitioner will go to, to uphold the ethos of genetic counselling, is to give an account in which one might be tempted, or have good moral reason, to be directive but refrains from doing so.

Finally, there is the case where the boundary between directiveness and non-directiveness is blurred and indistinct. The directiveness of the counsellor arises out of a determination to challenge their clients in a sustained manner to ensure that informed consent is based on an understanding of complexity rather than simple information-giving. Ironically, a directive approach to counselling actually seeks to avoid the paternalistic scenario of making decisions for their clients or abandoning their autonomy for the sake of non-directiveness (Bosk 1992, Wolff and Jung 1995, Clarke 1997b, Kessler 1997). This ‘tough love’ approach to counselling is justified by ethical principles and moral expectations that guide professional practice in the extreme circumstances of HD testing. As we have seen, ethical principles provide economical ways of formulating professional judgements about cases without having to engage in complex ethical debates and moral reasoning.

# 9 Conclusion

# Introduction

As a coincidence to this book going to press, in November 2010, the Nuffield Council of Bioethics published a report on new developments in the so-called era of ‘personalised healthcare’, the focus of our Chapter 5. Titled ‘Medical profiling and online medicine: the ethics of ‘personalised healthcare’ in a consumer age’, the Nuffield Report examined several case studies of new public/private services offering direct-to-consumer body imaging, genetic profiling, online health information and online purchasing of pharmaceuticals. Of interest to us is the way in which the report points to a context of social change extending beyond healthcare that shapes these developments, especially with regard to the autonomy of the ‘consumer-citizen’:

Technological change on its own does not necessarily change social relationships in any particular direction. The effects and implications of such change depend on culture and attitudes. When it comes to the developments in medical profiling and online medicine with which we are concerned here, we discuss … some of the ways in which those developments are shaped by, and have an impact on, social attitudes, public policy and economic changes. Some of those social factors include: (1) the development of a more globalised healthcare industry; (2) the common claim that services such as healthcare were previously domains where professionals exercised authority over clients but now involve more ‘consumerist’ attitudes; (3) changing attitudes to information technology in general (mainly through mainstream use of the internet in daily life); and (4) a common claim that there are pressures for the adoption of greater individual responsibility for the management of various personal risks, including those concerned with health. (2010: 26)

The task of ethical evaluation is not to assess the ‘effects’ of new technologies on society, but to understand, historically, the domain of changing values and social relationships. The Nuffield Report considers three overlapping factors that highlight economic, social and political changes in healthcare. For instance, a consumerist approach to healthcare criticises the bureaucracy of professional authority that fosters a state of paternalism and dependency; the widespread use of the internet facilitates globalisation of the healthcare industry; and consumers actively seek to manage their health wisely by demanding greater autonomy and choice.

The last sentence above drives home the theme most relevant to our own inquiry: ‘greater individual responsibility for the management of various personal risks’. In the genetics context, this extends to family risks, but note the expression ‘consumerist attitudes’ which implies that client autonomy is sovereign while professional authority is presumably muted. Not so recently, the movement known as ‘responsibilisation’ (O’Malley 1992) had alluded to this tension with regard to new developments in healthcare. Consider the following formulation in the Nuffield Report regarding ‘ethical pressures’ of personalised healthcare:

[T]he development of more ‘personalised’ healthcare in the sense of more individually specific diagnosis and prediction thus has a potentially doubleedged character. On the one hand, the doctrine of ‘responsibilisation’ seems to stress the value of allowing people to act as educated and empowered individuals, knowing more and able to increase their capacities to make informed decisions about the management of their health and illness. But on the other hand it may involve increased obligations and expectations on individuals to take this active role, requiring increasing skills in terms of selfeducation, and the need to make trade-offs between different options in terms of their relative costs and benefits. Sanctions or other consequences may flow from individuals not taking responsibility, either by not acting on the results of predictive tests, or perhaps, even by not informing themselves about their health risks. It also may mean that people come to feel guilt and anxiety if they do not fulfil these expectations – perhaps even a sense that they themselves, by acts of omission or commission, bear some blame for the illnesses that they or their family may suffer. Those who prefer not to know about the future and instead to live for the day may feel that position is condemned as irresponsible … Such ethical pressures on individuals are of course far from new, but the developments discussed in this report may well intensify them. (2010: 40–41)

The ‘potentially double-edged character’ of personalised healthcare is not a new theme, but one that resonates with the opening quote of this book. Butler’s ‘fettered freedom’ reminds us that even before the liberalisation of health services in the twentieth century, the relationship between ‘freedom’ and ‘obligation’ has always expressed an uneasy tension. The enhanced autonomy and choice of the consumer comes with the ‘increased obligations and expectations’ to make informed decisions about healthcare. Personalised technologies create greater demands for ‘self-education’ and greater pressure to make better choices. With responsibilisation comes the increased vulnerability to ‘sanctions or other consequences’ for ‘not taking responsibility’, for not managing one’s risk or personal affairs wisely. In other words, the underside of increased freedoms is the weight of obligations imposed and the ‘guilt and anxiety’ of not meeting these expectations, that failure to manage the double bind of autonomy/responsibility is blameworthy.

The Nuffield Report anticipates many of the themes and tensions covered in this book insofar as new genetic technologies are likely to intensify the micropolitics of autonomy, responsibility and blame.

# Themes and methods in this book

In Chapter 3, we argued that autonomy, responsibility and blame are deeply engrained in the ethos of liberal societies. This ethos has important implications for understanding the public and private provisions of healthcare systems and the kinds of policy and values that shape the rights and responsibilities of patients, consumers, families and professionals. These themes are not so much descriptions of actual states-of-affair; they explicate encounters and sites of tension between different social actors. In many ways, autonomy, responsibility and blame expose the contours of a ‘moral order’ in which new technologies of healthcare are negotiated in complex and subtle ways.

One of the main arguments we have developed in this book is that ‘genetic testing’ is not reducible to a laboratory procedure or a technological artefact. What distinguishes an ‘assay’ from a ‘test’, for instance, is the context in which DNA material is analysed, detected and quantified (Zimmern and Kroese 2007). But ‘context’ refers to more than just the application of an assay; it also refers to the conditions under which genetic knowledge about an assay is communicated to at-risk individuals and families. In Chapter 2, we explained that genetic testing includes counselling: this amounts to an ideological commitment to genetic counselling, but it is also an empirical commitment to an encounter that has its own logic and sensibility. From this point of view, it does not make sense to examine impacts of genetic testing in a decontexualised manner. The task is to examine empirically the complex interactions between technological and social systems, between artefacts and social problems, between professional and lay knowledges that give genetic testing its particular form.

If genetic testing is more than a laboratory result, then an empirically informed evaluation attends to something approximating the ‘context of communication’. However, ‘communication’ is a potentially elusive term that still implies a legacy of information processing. It implies that somehow knowledge is exchanged in a linear fashion independent of the pragmatic, symbolic and material conditions of knowledge-making. In this book, we have been committed to using an approach that directly acknowledges the practical, material and social dimensions of knowledge-production vis-à-vis the positioning of social actors. It does not assume a linear model of information transfer but a relational encounter of signification, of meaning-making. To put it simply, we have adopted a discursive approach to explore the variety of domains in which genetic knowledge is ‘mediated’ through language and social interaction.

In Chapter 4, what we have called Rhetorical Discourse Analysis is premised on the moral, practical and rhetorical aspects of social action/interaction. It immediately attends to the moral order in which social actions are situated; it attends to the practical and material dimension of social actions in which language plays a significant role; and it attends to the persuasive and argumentative nature of language use. However, what distinguishes rhetorical discourse analysis from other cognate analytic traditions is the characterisation of discourse as accounts embedded within a sphere of social accountability. As we have explained, accountability refers to ordinary actions that constitute the moral order by making its codes visible, explicable and sensible to others. In the context of genetic testing, we have sought to understand the conditions under which it becomes necessary to provide accounts that defend, assert or problematise freedom and choice of action.

One of the themes that has motivated our research is that ‘genetic responsibility’ has come to describe a phenomenon in which biological knowledge of one’s future has entered the field of calculation and management of one’s freedom. We describe this phenomenon in Chapter 1 using spatial metaphors such as ‘field’, ‘domain’ and ‘landscape’ whereby the task is to understand the specific locations in which genetic knowledge creates new relationships and reconfigures old ones. In terms of their relevance to new genetic technologies, let us reconsider the domains in which accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame have relational and temporal consequences for others.

# The public domain

The domain of public mediation is central to understanding the collective imagination of genomic knowledge. The mass communication of recent scientific discoveries, the marketing of various kinds of genetic testing for paternity, ancestry and disease susceptibility, exemplify new patterns of consumption in which genomic knowledge promises greater self-knowledge and identity. In Chapter 5, we argued that the discourse on personalisation is a powerful way of framing the future of healthcare around the central promise that the human genome contains unique biological information about a person’s future health. The rise of directto-consumer companies represents a potential market of those who are willing to take genetic responsibility and to pay for biological information to ‘empower prevention’. Indeed, decoding biological material into digital information creates an ideal medium for web-based services to ‘customise’ preventative health information.

The case study we presented in Chapter 5 illustrates a peculiar genre of documentary and promotional advertising. Using celebrity experience as a vehicle for consumption, The Killer in Me seeks to shock as well as entertain and inform the public about developments in genetic susceptibility testing for common complex diseases. We identified the ways in which media commentary, medical exposition and personal experience are combined to create an ‘economy of hope’ by first alluding to a pervasive climate of fear. Rhetorical devices routinely inflate perceptions of disease and problematise conventional understandings of health as a state of non-disease. The ‘reality’ of DNA testing is a story told by building and releasing tension: fabricating a reality of genetic risk, portraying genetic knowledge as authoritative and objective, and contrasting the extreme reality of disease with the hope of prevention. Our concern is that manufacturing such tensions may mislead the public into believing that susceptibility testing is unproblematically informative and clinically valid, without the benefit of pre- or post-test counselling.

In many ways, this performance of genomic knowledge in the public domain evokes two dominant emotional reactions or ‘affects’. On the one hand, it strongly appeals to a locus of self-control and self-knowledge by ‘empowering’ the consumer with the choice of prevention. On the other, it exposes the dreadful reality of a lurking pathology that threatens to undermine personal autonomy. The dominant affections of knowing or not knowing and whether knowing can actually alter one’s destiny are themes which reinforce powerful assumptions of genetic essentialism and determinism. It also confirms that marketisation of genetic testing is more persuasive when it routinely deletes the complexity and uncertainty of science (Saferstein and Sarangi 2010, Arribas-Ayllon et al. 2011). The commercialisation of genetic testing is a logical extension of the increasingly fluid relationship between health and disease, and The Killer in $M e$ is plain evidence of the manipulation of public anxieties to motivate potential customers to participate in a life of continuous risk management and disease prevention.

# The family domain

Often, there is a temptation to pronounce that new genetic technologies create choices and responsibilities that in turn forge new identities and networks of kinship. However, the impact of new technologies does not mark a radical break with the past. In Chapter 1, we discussed the tension between two styles of thought described as ‘transformational’ and ‘contextual’ (Hedgecoe and Martin 2008). These distinctions are analytic and heuristic categories rather than rigid divisions of thought styles. Nevertheless, they express a tension about the extent to which technologies facilitate social change. Some approaches are more inclined to emphasise discontinuity, while others prefer to show how new knowledge maintains continuities with the past. Even Novas and Rose are cautious in acknowledging that: ‘Ideas about biological, biomedical and genetic identity will certainly infuse, interact, combine and contest with other identity claims; we doubt that they will supplant them’ (2000: 491). In this book, we have sought to maintain a balance between these styles of thinking, which comes out strongly within the family domain.

In the context of genetic testing of children, parental accounts often acknowledge the child’s autonomy and the right of the child to make their own autonomous decisions about genetic risk. The autonomy of the child is, after all, a recent historical invention. The Children Act of 1989 reinforced the view that children were now legally separate entities, while parents were contractually bound to promote their ‘best interests’ (Buchanan and Brock 1989, King and Piper 1990). In family interviews, parents engage in various kinds of moral presentation that endorse this view of autonomy. In many cases, this involves strategically enrolling the voice of the child to convey a dialogic family whereby genetic responsibility is passed smoothly down (or across) the generations. In the event that disclosure of genetic risk is yet to occur, parents will engage in promissory accounts of hypothetical disclosure whereby genetic responsibility is deferred and oriented to future characters and events. Not all families, however, exemplify this moral ideal of open and inclusive communication, although committed to upholding the ‘best interests’ of the child. Families often account for genetic responsibility by locating an ‘other’ against whom blame is attributed. Beyond its obvious reporting function, blaming others is an effective way of signalling selfresponsibility in accounts of disclosing genetic risk to other family members. Families appear to engage in blame for two main reasons: over competing versions of genetic responsibility or over incongruent or disparate understandings of genetics. The uneven use of exoneration towards family members also suggests that those who are still active in their reproductive responsibilities are likely to be differentially accountable to managing genetic risk, including open disclosure.

The moral economy of the family is not always aligned with the normative obligations of genetic responsibility. Though it is tempting to suggest that genetic responsibility installs new patterns of identification and obligation, the phenomenon of blame and of not disclosing genetic risk to extended family members points to a domain of diverse ethical and practical moral reasoning. Genetic knowledge is modulated by existing structures of kinship, understandings of inheritance and the burden of knowing or disclosing genetic risk (Arribas-Ayllon, Featherstone and Atkinson 2011). Complex formulations of character sometimes justify the deferral of knowledge so as to define, limit and draw boundaries around the family. In this sense, practical ethics is the everyday manifestation of local, moral and even risky practices of obligation, surveillance and protectionism. Thus, it is not the normative dimension of conduct that exclusively sustains the micromoral politics of genetic risk. Rather, it is how these problematic events are restored or repaired in everyday situations that provide a more nuanced view of genetic responsibility and, by extension, ‘genetic blameworthiness’.

# The clinical domain

The clinical domain of genetic counselling, which cuts across the public and family domains, is a communication-rich environment that often focuses on risk explanations and reflections about future hypothetical scenarios, which can potentially influence decisional outcomes. It is a domain in which the future is folded into the present, where future characters and events are enrolled as devices for reflection and understanding; it is a site where different versions of professional and clients’ responsibility and autonomy meet. While the goal of counselling is to progress through a shared agenda and process towards an agreed end, in reality competing versions of autonomy and responsibility can lead to misalignments and tensions. For instance, it is commonplace for clients to attend counselling with the consumerist expectation of ‘wanting to know’ their risks, while the counsellor’s role is to make clients aware of the benefits of knowing, while also underscoring the risks of knowing their genetic status, both for the individual and for the family as a whole (Sarangi et al. 2003). Counselling is also complicated by the commonly held belief by clients that genetic test results convey certainty, even when testing is only able to suggest probabilities of risk. Thus, counsellors deliberately place some emphasis upon the possibility of a positive test result or an inconclusive test result, which needs to be included in the decision-making process.

In clinic consultations surrounding genetic testing of children, parents employ a wide variety of resources to advance their case for knowing what can be known. Often this entails accounts of moral responsibility while at the same time hoping for a favourable result. They seem to be able to provide compelling accounts of coping with (unwelcome) knowledge and often foreground their capacity to engage in dialogic family communication as a reason for testing; that knowing the test result would facilitate openness of communication, although this is not generally true of all family accounts. Parents appeal to what they authoritatively know about their children through devices such as character work to justify for knowing. Parental requests can result in complex encounters where the counsellor may seek to discourage surreptitious or inappropriate testing. In such cases, the child’s future autonomy is juxtaposed against the parent’s current rights through the use of rhetorical devices such as contrast. While parents may generally use contrast to justify their preference for testing the child, the professional may use it to offer ‘recommended options’ without appearing to explicitly counter the parent’s concerns (Sarangi and Clarke 2002a). Thus, the best interests of the child will assume rhetorical significance in parental accounts, while allusions to the dialogic family may also seek to gain leverage in the negotiation of childhood genetic testing.

Although the boundary between directiveness and non-directiveness in genetic counselling is sometimes unclear, genetic professionals often seek to address all possible scenarios and to facilitate client reflection about the uncertainties following a test result. They see it as an imperative to explore the perspectives of absent others, including the children for whom testing decisions have direct consequences, and spouses and siblings. The values of the professional are often signalled, albeit subtly, through preferences and dispreferences and through the portrayal of other scenarios, including hypothetical events, to steer the process towards a preferred outcome (Sarangi 2010a). Family circumstances are bound to differ and the scope of the clinic consultation is restricted severely as to how thoroughly it is possible to weigh up all possible perspectives to arrive at a consensual and preferred decision. Nevertheless, there is always an element of contingency concerning how clients account for themselves before a test and how they may account for their circumstances after test results are known. Although the micropolitics of genetic counselling is oriented to facilitating the autonomy of clients in ways that adequately consider the complexities of genetic risk, the ambivalence and differential motivations of clients strongly indicate that rational autonomy does not guarantee how people understand and experience genetic risk.

In Chapter 8, we showed that a dominant theme in professional accounts of genetic testing in the prenatal clinic is the problem of maintaining an ethical boundary between directive and non-directive approaches to counselling. Dilemmas often occur when the intricate entanglements of family relationships and misalignments in professional–client interactions map on to this boundary. We have seen that professionals often use case-based accounts to develop a situated ethical position that they can adopt and defend and that reflection upon ‘grand’ principles is not a prominent feature of their accounts. When ethical principles are used, they provide economical ways of formulating professional judgements about cases without having to engage in complex ethical and moral reasoning. The limits placed upon professional judgement are rarely about the pure undecidability of such cases, but usually the practical difficulty of managing asymmetries within the clinic.

Genetics professionals maintain this boundary of directiveness and non-directiveness by strategically employing accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame. For instance, they describe cases in which third parties play a complicating role in the decision-making process. In the context of prenatal genetics, the figure of ‘the mother’ is often placed at the centre of these accounts, while other characters play a prominent role in persuading her to have or not have genetic testing. In such accounts, extreme case formulations are used to upgrade inferences of persuasion to that of coercion to justify the protective role of the genetic counsellor. A distinct characteristic of these kinds of accounts is the use of blame to undercut the reasons or intentions of characters who use ‘unreasonable’ force to influence decisions in the clinic.

We have also seen that explicit accounts of directiveness, with regard to the counselling process, arise out of a determination to challenge clients in a sustained manner to generate complex relational understandings surrounding the social and ethical implications of prenatal testing. Rather than seeking to elicit informed consent through information-giving, the counsellor performs a stronger role in facilitating the client’s autonomy by sharing the burden of differential responsibilities between professionals and clients. Whilst acknowledging that it may not be realistic to expect that value-neutrality and non-directiveness can be fully achieved, the ethos of genetic counselling must, for ideological reasons, retain its commitment to non-directiveness in a weaker sense. But the acknowledgement of ‘appropriate directiveness’ (Clarke 1991) in genetic counselling in at least some areas of practice is not to endorse a return to paternalism. The difficulty that faces genetics professionals in the future is balancing the need to avoid making decisions for their clients without at the same time abandoning their autonomy in the name of non-directiveness.

# ‘Thick’ versus ‘thin’ accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame

The method we have used in this book is one that seeks to make the public, family and clinical domains visible and their practices explicable. It seeks to bring these relationships to life by means of real-life data that produce a description of these domains. We have used concepts such as autonomy, responsibility and blame to describe the contours of these relationships in which choices and obligations are created, negotiated and sometimes contested. However, the method of description we have used also has implications for how we might reformulate the adequacy and meaning of these concepts.

Indeed, the work of describing domains in which autonomy, responsibility and blame appear to play an explanatory role can be recontextualised by means of another metaphor. When Geertz (1973) and Ryle (1971) applied the term ‘thick description’, each to their own concerns about the impoverished language of hidden motivations and intentions, they were both attending to the complicated nature in which human action is shaped by ‘context’ or by ‘external circumstances’. ‘Thin’ versions of autonomy seem plausible when we focus on the agency of technology and the self-evidence of information-giving, simply articulated as Your result is $X .$ This seems natural when the focus is on the solitary individual pondering a choice, digesting information or making a decision of which they appear to be the author. In thin accounts of autonomy, context melts into the background, the presence of other actors and relations become absent or at least peripheral to the concerns of the autonomous subject. Furthermore, the role of language takes on a translucent, functional quality of merely assisting the transmission of mental states. As the vehicle of intentions, language is emptied of all its cultural, symbolic and rhetorical force. So too, responsibility is reduced to either a functional biological norm or an immutable rule, which serve as preconditions for the exercise of autonomy. Of course, the counterpart of moral obligation to immutable laws or biological functions is the error or dysfunction of the individual who fails to observe or embody them. In the moral order of thin accounts, the individual is rendered faulty, ignorant and blameworthy.

Thick accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame differ from thin accounts in the sense that they include more information about the practice and setting to which they refer. To be sure, accounts of autonomy, responsibility and blame are not referring to self-contained individuals, though there may be occasions in which the actions of individuals occupy our attention. Rather, they refer to spaces and events in which these concepts emerge in relation to social activities and interactions. In bioethics, Harris (1985) has argued that ‘thin’ conceptions of autonomy refer to the commonsense belief that people are capable of making choices and fashioning their destiny through acts of self-determination; i.e., autonomy $=$ independence. In contrast, Husted (1997) has argued that ‘thick’ autonomy is an extension of the capacities of the self-determining subject whereby individuals are capable of reflecting critically upon differential motivations; i.e., autonomy $=$ reflexive independence. Both versions are rhetorically motivated accounts that abstract the capacities of persons from ethical problems, as in the case of the ‘right to know’ or the ‘right not to know’ in the disclosure of genetic information (Chadwick et al. 1997).

We have proposed a different account of autonomy. We do not use the term ‘autonomy’ to describe an ontological fact but to rehearse a historical problem. If, in liberal western society, our freedom obliges us to govern ourselves, then autonomy is not about describing this or that quality of being, but understanding how people manage and negotiate the problem of freedom in the context of genetic knowledge. A thick account of autonomy and responsibility is one that attends to what happens in these domains. If we have pointed to these concepts in this book and said, ‘Look! Here it is’, we are not suggesting that we have discovered autonomy and responsibility in this or that person. Rather, we are historically obliged to use these terms to make sense of problems in which activities and relations, problems and spaces, resemble autonomy, responsibility and blame.

For example, when clients have made a decision to test or not to test after a long process of genetic counselling, we do not separate the clients’ autonomous decision from the counsellor who had facilitated that decision. We do not separate the decision from the presence or absence of third parties who also have an investment in genetic testing. And we do not abstract a single act of rational calculation from the experience of making decisions suffused with fluctuating ambivalence and affect. In this sense, what we are more or less obliged to call ‘autonomy’ or ‘responsibility’ emerges from the context of thick description. Within the moral order of thick accounts, it becomes less relevant to ask ‘Who is blameworthy?’ than to understand how blame becomes a manifestation or a performance of what participants do in order to signal self-responsibility or distance themselves socially and morally from others.

# The future of genetic testing

We have presented the view above that, for the most part, genetic tests are being applied appropriately and helpfully in the context of Mendelian disorders and chromosome anomalies, both in diagnostic and predictive settings and in the context of decisions about reproduction. Testing for risk of the common complex disorders is for now most appropriately carried out with non-DNA-based methods (such as assessments of BMI, blood pressure and fasting blood glucose and cholesterol). While genome wide association studies (GWAS) have not established a role in this area, they may be helpful for research into underlying pathogenic mechanisms; however, the way in which genome sequencing will be applied to the clinical challenges of the common complex diseases remains uncertain. The new, high-throughput sequencing technologies will certainly transform clinical genetics practice and are likely to transform some areas of general, clinical medicine too – but the new shape that will be taken by medical care remains unclear.

The genetic testing for common diseases that is available now and which can provide clinically useful and validated information is limited. The principal category of such testing available in practice is the identification of the small number of families affected by Mendelian forms of the common disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD), breast and bowel cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Around 2–5 percent of those affected by such conditions have a strongly inherited, Mendelian or single-gene basis for their condition. The clarification of the risk status of individuals within these families can be helpful clinically and psychosocially. Those at high risk of CAD because of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) can be usually treated with highly effective drugs that lower both serum cholesterol and coronary risk. Those at high risk of cancer of the bowel or breastand-ovaries can have enhanced surveillance (colonoscopy, mammography) and/ or prophylactic surgery. The medical management of the rare Mendelian forms of diabetes, often known rather awkwardly as ‘maturity-onset diabetes of the young’ (MODY), may be optimised more readily if the particular genetic basis has been recognised at an early stage.

For other individuals, however, who are at low risk of disease, there is little to recommend surveying a selection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine the relative risk of disorders such as CAD, stroke and cancer. The ‘healthy living’ advice given to all risk groups is essentially the same and the limited evidence available does not suggest that knowledge of genetic risk has much effect on compliance with advice about lifestyle and diet (Marteau et al. 2010). The differences in risk between individuals will usually only be modest, especially if one looks at the overall pattern of risk across the diseases and if one acknowledges that the estimates of heritability accounted for by GWAS-based genetic profile testing is at best modest. There is no reason to think that these risk assessments currently have anything to offer healthcare that is not provided by measures of simpler intermediate phenotypes such as blood pressure, serum cholesterol and apolipoproteins (McQueen et al. 2008, Edelman and Eng 2009, van der Net et al. 2009).

The consequence of this for genetic counselling is that the major issues arising in ‘traditional’ genetic counselling – that relate to the adjustment of genetic disease in the family, to predictive and prenatal genetic testing and to family communication – simply do not arise in the context of the complex disorders. The skills required to help individuals adjust to their risk of such disorders have more to do with behaviour change, such as smoking cessation and lifestyle coaching, than with genetic counselling as conventionally practised.

Recent events in the USA have sharpened the debate about the benefits of personalised medicine and have provided a disturbing glimpse of the problems with the commercial model. In July 2010, companies such as 23andMe, Navigenics and Pathway Genomics were forced to defend their services in Congress after being issued device notification letters by the FDA. Perhaps the most damning evidence was heard from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). An undercover investigation revealed that company call centres engaged in ‘deceptive marketing’, in which ‘consumers’ from the investigation team were told that genetic testing could predict what sports a child will excel in; that supplements could ‘repair damaged DNA’, that it was possible to surreptitiously test one’s partner and ‘surprise’ him with the results; and that a ‘high risk’ of breast cancer was equivalent to a diagnosis (Kutz 2010). Furthermore, direct-to-consumer companies failed to notify ethnic and racial minorities that genetic research is mainly conducted in Caucasian populations, thus undermining the accuracy of their test results. The outcomes of the Congressional hearings are likely to lead to substantial regulations of the personal genomics industry, but there is also reason to believe that regulators in the USA may be reluctant to resort to the lengths taken by Germany, which effectively banned DTC genetic testing. In a thoughtful account of these developments, Vorhaus (2010) argues that on either side of the consumer/corporate divide, there is a huge demand for personalised medicine which, in itself, provides considerable incentive for companies, consumers and regulators to find a way of working together to provide individuals access to their genomic data.

In Britain, regulators have been slow to move on DTC profiling and testing for susceptibility to multifactorial diseases. However, the recent Nuffield Report, introduced at the beginning of this chapter, provides a comprehensive outline of the relevant social, ethical and legal issues. The central concern is the limited and ambiguous predictive value of the risk estimates offered by these companies, and the Report recommends ‘independent research on the impact and effects of multifactiorial genetic testing on individuals so the harms can be quantified’ (2010: 158). The Report frames the problem of genetic susceptibility testing in terms of two competing developments. Increased ‘consumerisation’ has risen from global access to genetic tests through online providers without having to go through professional gatekeepers such as a genetic counsellor. In the global market of healthcare, the trade-off for more choice and access is increased ‘responsibilisation’; that responsibility for the interpretation of complex risk and for recognition of the limited predictive value of these tests falls upon the consumer. The Nuffield Report is reluctant to propose any sanctions that would prevent individuals from buying these tests without good evidence of actual harm to the consumer. On this basis, intervention is justified in terms of the ‘proportionality principle’: that given the high value accorded to individual liberty, ‘the coerciveness of intervention should be appropriate to the risks or harms involved and the costs should be proportioned to likely benefits’ (2010: 56).

If the future of healthcare continues to follow this path of increasing consumerisation and responsibilisation, then terms such as ‘genetic’ and ‘biological’ citizenship will become more rather than less relevant (Petersen and Bunton 2002, Heath et al. 2003, Rose and Novas 2005). The centrality accorded to individual liberty combined with the reluctance of regulators to intervene in the healthcare market (unless of course actual harms can be attributed) means that cultivating ‘consumer citizenship’ is very likely to be the proposed solution. Indeed, this is what the Nuffield Report recommends: that provision of information and support should be made available so that consumers can make informed choices appropriate for their needs. This requires that both consumers and nongenetics professionals be more discerning and cognisant of the benefits and risks of new genetic technologies. However, the Report does not endorse caveat emptor (‘let the buyer beware’) as a justification for non-intervention: ‘companies should not be offering these services if they are not able to offer an integrated, fully supported service’ (2010: 229). This leaves open a space for discussing the questions about the burden of making additional decisions that many citizens do not have the time, energy, opportunity or capacity to consider.1

# Back to the future

Turning to the new sequencing technologies, it is clear that we have arrived ‘back to the future’. While the human genome sequence was hyped as the ‘Holy Grail’, genetic information could be applied to patients but only one gene at a time. Genetic information has been diagnostically useful for more than 40 years in relation to chromosome disorders and for more than 20 years for Mendelian diseases but we will soon have full genome sequences on patients, which allow us to look simultaneously across all genes and the non-gene regions of the genome too. This information about an individual is a more-or-less constant item in their biological constitution: everything else is dynamic and fluctuating. The serum cholesterol changes hour to hour, the glucose and insulin change minute to minute and differ in different parts of the body. The volume of the heart’s left ventricle changes during the heart beat and the bulk of the quadriceps femoris or biceps brachii muscles changes with use or disuse over weeks or months. But the genome stays, almost completely, the same. Is this information of any use to physicians in treating a patient? Or in preventing the development of disease? The answer is going to be a cautious ‘Yes’, but it will depend upon on whether a specific DNA result gives a useful guide to action; this may take years, perhaps decades, to determine. At the same time, the availability of patients’ sequence data opens up new possibilities for investigating and understanding the whole range of dynamic variables of crucial importance in understanding metabolism and physiology through a ‘systems biology’ approach (Auffray et al. 2009).

Do we live in exciting times? The future of healthcare will be very different once genomics has had time to impact on medicine over the next several decades. We cannot predict where and in what ways genomic knowledge is going to alter healthcare because the evidence is still being gathered; there has been altogether too much hype and premature prediction in the past. Nevertheless, the arrival of personal genome sequences in the clinic will mean that the important questions can now begin to be asked. The unique nature of genetic information means that we are on the point of taking a major step towards an improved understanding of the workings of the body in health and disease. However, despite these grounds for optimism, we end with a note of caution. Foucault (1980) reminds us that it is not the domain of health and disease that will decide the future politics of life, but the domain of optimisation. Whatever life will be in the future, it will be fashioned out of a responsibility to our own biology and out of the political organisation of problems, practices and technologies that will seek to increase its value.

# Notes

# Chapter 2

1 In Germany, for example, insurance schemes used to reimburse the costs of the genetic test only, so it was unattractive for a genetics unit to provide genetic counselling that might help clients to rethink a request for testing and then decide not to go ahead. Such a scheme of unhelpful and rather perverse incentives still operates in Japan, so that the development of genetic counselling is happening there despite financial disincentives; the provision of genetic counselling increases costs (through employing more staff) while reducing income (because some clients may choose not to be tested, who would have gone ahead with testing if genetic counselling had not been available).   
2 These may be accompanied by unusual physical features, such as a dysmorphic ‘syndrome’.   
3 These are often rare and unusual disorders caused by changes in a single gene and that can affect multiple members of a family, being transmitted in one of the three major patterns of inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and sex-linked).   
4 Fibrillin or collagen protein molecules are the building blocks that assemble into long multimeric chains that are easily disrupted in the presence of some components with altered amino acid sequence. In such settings, an apparently minor change in amino-acid sequence causes more serious disease than a complete absence of gene product from the mutated allele (the altered version or copy of the gene). This is an example of a dominant negative effect, where the mutation of one allele effectively disrupts the functioning of the other allele as well.   
5 As an aside, it can be argued that the information that should be treated as private and fully confidential is the clinical diagnosis rather than the precise mutation underlying that diagnosis, so once an affected individual has told others at risk that s/he has a given condition then they should be able to access testing for that same mutation without necessarily requiring the formal consent of the first individual in the family to have undergone genetic testing. The precise mutation can be regarded as the genetic laboratory’s information rather than belonging to whichever member of the family it was, in whom the mutation was first found (see discussion in Lucassen and Clarke 2007).   
6 Whereas it used to be illegal to induce an abortion in many countries, legislation permitting an abortion under defined circumstances has changed so that an early prenatal diagnosis can now be linked to the selective termination of the pregnancy if the test result indicates that the child would be affected.   
7 Newborn screening for hearing impairment also identifies those with deafness of

non-genetic aetiology.

# Chapter 3

1 Both Polanyi (1957) and Dean (1991) have argued that Malthus’ ‘bioeconomic’ argument had a significant impact on British Poor Law reform. The Poor Law Amendment Act

of 1834 signalled a new alignment between the laws of biology and the laws of political economy to replicate a ‘natural’ order based on independence, self-discipline and private economic responsibility.

# Chapter 4

1 See Potter (1996) on constructions of ‘out-there-ness’ as a way of understanding how facticity is constructed in the media.   
2 See also other relevant studies dealing with marginalised groups such as homosexuals (Humphreys 1970), heroin users (Stoddart 1974) and convicts (Wieder 1974).   
3 Unlike Goffman who sees ‘remediation’ as the higher concept under which accounts, apologies and requests are available to the accused, Scott and Lyman place ‘accounts’ as the higher concept of repair under which apologies are a subcategory.   
4 Austin gives a witty example of a distinction between the phrases ‘by mistake’ or ‘by accident’. Both terms have confusingly similar meanings, but can be teased apart by foregrounding the appropriate action. The use of illustrative narratives is one such method: ‘You have a donkey, so have I, and they graze in the same field. The day comes when I conceive a dislike for mine. I go to shoot it, draw a bead on it, fire: the brute falls in its tracks. I inspect the victim, and find to my horror that it is your donkey. I appear on your doorstep with the remains and say – what? ‘I say, old sport, I’m awfully sorry, &c, I’ve shot your donkey by accident’? Or ‘by mistake’? Then again, I go to shoot my donkey as before, draw a bead on it, fire – but as I do so, the beasts move, and to my horror yours falls. Again the scene on the doorstep – what do I say? ‘By mistake’? Or ‘by accident’?’ (Austin 1961: xx)

# Chapter 5

1 Taking the category of ‘modernity’ as a description of global change, Bauman (2000) argues that there has been a fundamental change in the relationship between time and space. Previous forms of modernity were characterised by rigidity of order – centralisation of power, empire building, nationalisation, etc. – while late modernity is now characterised by fluidity of order – deregulation, liberalisation, flexibilisation, etc. He calls this state of perpetual flux within structures of sociality and social identity ‘liquid modernity’.

2 In the UK, there are growing tensions between ‘personalised medicine’ and public healthcare. This reflects the differences between consumer-based approaches emphasising greater choice and the provision of a National Health Service based on principles of universality and equality. There are, broadly speaking, two models of personalisation each promising different things. The commercial model promises consumer empowerment through more choice and ‘direct’ access to services, while the public model of personalisation promises highly tailored care and greater participation of clients in their healthcare alongside professionals. In the commercial version, autonomy is contrasted with paternalism, while in the public version autonomy and paternalism are combined in an optimal relationship.

3 It is important to note that the genetic testing offered by GeneticHealth is largely irrelevant to the client’s risk of disease where their concern is based on a strong family history. Instead of SNP-based testing for common genes, what is required in those circumstances is the search for mutations in genes of major effect, such as (among others) the presenilin genes for Alzheimer’s disease, BRCA1 or BRCA2 for breast cancer and the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene, LDLR, for coronary artery disease.

# Chapter 7

1 PKD is normally diagnosed by the presence of multiple cysts in both kidneys seen on ultrasound scan but these will often not be present in infancy; the cysts may develop over many years. Familial breast cancer accounts for some $5 - 1 0 \%$ of breast cancer and is sometimes associated with ovarian and other malignancies. The tumours often develop at somewhat earlier ages than usual. Genetic testing is available for mutations at two of the loci that particularly contribute to the increased risk of malignancy found in some families. This can inform decisions about surveillance programmes for breast and ovarian cancer, drug treatments that might reduce the risk of breast cancer and prophylactic surgery (the removal of ovaries and/or breast tissue). Huntington’s Disease is a late-onset degenerative neuropsychiatric disorder, with no effective treatment. Predictive tests are, however, available, which can attest that there is a 50 percent chance that the child of an affected parent will have inherited the disease-associated mutation.

2 A majority of the genetic consultations were drawn from two funded projects: the Leverhulme Trust (1998–99) and the Wellcome Trust (2001–4). We are also grateful to Dr. Kate Brain for additional breast cancer cases.

# Chapter 8

1 One should note that the work of genetic counsellors in the USA includes activities that would be undertaken by midwives in the UK. However, there are very few studies that examine the professional practice of midwives in the UK, let alone the kinds of ethical problems they face (Skirton et al. 2010).   
2 There are several channels or mechanisms employed by genetics health professionals in the UK to deal with these recurrent problems. One is simply to discuss the problems as they arise with colleagues or to raise them at professional team meetings within the genetics service. There should also be access to clinical supervision with a counsellor or psychologist, which is a need much better recognised by genetic counsellors than clinical geneticists (Clarke et al. 2007).   
3 The policy implications of non-paternity cases are mixed with different countries adopting slightly different approaches. Lucassen and Parker (2001) suggest that the possibility of finding non-paternity should be raised in advance with a couple on every occasion when it might be revealed by genetic testing. This approach is recommended in some countries (e.g., Australia), but many UK practitioners feel that it would be difficult to do this in practice on every occasion.   
4 When a translocation occurs in balanced form there may be no adverse consequences because there is no net loss or gain of chromosomal material but the production of ‘balanced’ gametes (with the correct set of chromosome material) may be compromised and rendered less likely.

# Chapter 9

1 What may not be fully evident from the Report, however, is that any society will include many citizens whose abilities or circumstances make it difficult for them to fulfil the expected obligations. When a society moves in the direction of imposing more responsibility on its members – when the state retreats from the direct provision of services to the less able and the disadvantaged – then it is not only the poor, the sick and the disabled who are burdened, but many others with heavy commitments to other people or to other goals. This may lead to unintended consequences that undermine any ‘efficiency savings’ that the proponents of responsibilisation may claim as its justification. This will be true if the state’s involvement is being ‘rolled back’ in order to replace it with the values of consumerist citizenship.
