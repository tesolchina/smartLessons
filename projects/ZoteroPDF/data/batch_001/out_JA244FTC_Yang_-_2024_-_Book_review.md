English writing is widely acknowledged as one of the most challenging skill for language learners. t involves navigating complex grammar and synta, requiring active and creative language production. Unlike speaking and listening, writing tass ofer limited and delayed fedback, making eror corrction more difficult for leaners. Therfore, writing has always been amajor difficulty faced by students in English language learning (Moses & Mohamad, 2019). English language teachers, especially those in second or foreign language contexts, face numerous challenges in teaching writing effectively (Zhao & Zhang, 2022).Consequently, English writing receives considerable attention as a fundamental language skil for second language learners. While significant amount of literature exists on teaching and learning English writing, few books cater to early career eachers in a cler, practical, jrgon-free manner. As a teacher and researcher with over 15 years of experience in second language acquisition, I believe that the book Insights into Teaching and Learning Writing offr n exciting opportunit to enhance readers understanding of teaching and learning writig. By highlighting recent studies and providing a comprehensive review of diverse topics in second language writing research, particularly for new and pre-service teachers, this book avoids technical jargon, making it ccessble to a wide audience. Therfore, the publication of Inights into Teaching and Learning Writing is poised to be a significant addition to the existing litrature. In this sense, this book is a timely contribution that is expected to bridge the gaps by presenting conceptual and theoretical frameworks of second language writing research and pedagogical implications of the latest studies in a reader-friendly and practical style. It is a very useful companion for language teachers who give substantial attention to teaching writing in their courses, particularly for new teachers and pre-service teachers.

This book comprises 14 chapters, covering a wide array of topics, including teaching writing for academic and specific purposes, complexit, accuracy, and fluency in witing, asmet literacy, teting issues in writing techer cogntion, indiual diffees, learner autonomy, collaborative writing, technology-assisted writing, written corrective feback, and future directions in writing research. Each chapter follows a clear and easy-to-follow structure, commencing with the introduction of the topics, theoretical frameworks, and literature review, and then presenting practical implications for early-carer teachers. Finall, each chapter concludes with suggestions for action research or case studies and recommendations for further reading.

Chapter 1 by Helen Basturkmen provides an overview of teaching writing for academic and specific purposes, particularly within the domain of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL). It highlights the importance of teaching English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and English for Specific Purposes (ESP) due to the increasing demand for writing courses for workplace or professional needs. This advocates for a transition among ESL teachers from teaching general English to teaching EAP and ESP, which requires a shift in teaching pedagogy towards raising awareness of linguistic features, genre analysis and needs of learners in diffrent discilines and stages of study. Consequently, the author posits a case study approach as a means for novice teachers to observe and learn from experienced practitioners.

In Chapter 2, Mahmoud Altalouli and Mary Jane Curry provide valuable insights into integrating academic reading into writing instruction for students using English as an additional language (EAL) in higher education contexts. The authors delve into the intrcate relationship between academic reading and writing and argue that teaching writing without teaching reading is inadequate drawing upon cognitive and social perspectives on reading for writing. Then the practical implications especially the useful approaches to explicit reading for writing (RFW) instruction are proposed to help EAL students navigate the literacy demands of academic contexts. These approaches include focusing on reading-writing practices on the syllabus, using exemplars and personal corpus, and analyzing exemplary papers, peer texts and a personal corpus. This chapter primarily focuses on the instructor's role in providing explicit instruction, but it would be valuable to explore the role of students in actively engaging with reading and writing tasks.

The third chapter authored by Lee McCallum and NillCurry offers a comprehensive review and analysis of the concept of complexity, accuracy and fluency (CAF) in second and foreign language writing proficiency. It examines the theoretical framework of

CAF in L2 writing and its origins in defining language proficiency and sheds light on the importance of evaluating learners' language proficiency, the creation of proficiency frameworks, and the role of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) in articulating and measuring language proficiency. Furthermore, the authors elucidate the operationalization of CAF in grading scales and proficiency examinations by using CEFR and Cambridge English Asessment exams as examples. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the significance of understanding and interpreting the CAF dimensions for teacher training.

Chapter 4, written by Deborah Crusan, Ali Panahi, and HassanMohebbi, discussesthe important role of edagogical knowledge and assessment literacy for L2 writing teachers. Given the inseparability of assessment from the dynamics of learning and teaching, the authors believe that teachers should possessa range of asessment competencie, including knowledge of assessment paradigms, language pedagogy,technical oncepts, and contextual variables. They explicitly emphasize the profound rol of formative assessment in the realm of L2 writing education, the integration of asessment with the curriculum, and the specific components of L2 writing assesment literacy. The concluding remarks further elaborate on the impact f asessment in shaping teachers' philosophies, peda gogical approaches, and interactions with students writing. However, the article could benefit from more concrete examples and case studies to illustrate the practical application of assessment literacy in the classroom.

In the following chapter, Chengyuan Yu investigates the relationship between asessment and learning in the context of English language ucatio with a particular mphsis on the testing of wriig kill. The author presents different tems and practies used to denote the relationship between learning and asessment, such as assessment f learning (AoL), assessment for learning (AfLl), and assesment as learning (Aal). The exploration then extends further to encompass the historical development and pedagogicalvalue of standardized tests for writing, and a practical guide for integrating standardized tests into English language teacher education, which includes four steps: design, explain, coordinate, and reinforce. Finall, the author furnishes principles and recommended practices for designing learning-oriented assessment tasks using standardized tests.

Chapter 6 by K. James Hartshorn gives an account of studies on teacher cognition in the context of second language writing. The author defines teacher cognition as the psychological constructs related to a teacher's knowledge, beliefs, and thinking that inform their classrom practices. Existing ach identifie thr interrelated as hat ted to sha tchr cogntion i ana teching and learning. These include prior language learning experience, teacher education, and classoom practice. The author further explores the complexities and discrepancies between teacher beliefs and behaviors in L2 writing istruction, contending that an in-depth investigation into teacher cognition is crucial for teacher prearation and professional deelopment. In essence, this chapter sugests that a comprehensive understanding of teacher belief, the educational context, and the specific needs of students is paramount for the facilitation of effective L2 writing instruction.

Olena Vasylets and Rosa M. Manchon, in Chapter 7, undertake a comprehensive review of recent research focusing on the role of individual difference (Ds) in second language acquistion (A) stde, spficll in rlation to writing, and discus the thretical, empirical, and pedagogical significance of these studies. The theoretical framework of IDs in writing mainly includes language aptitude, working memory, motivation, belifs, sef-fficacy, self-rlation, and axiety. The authors critically exmine the empirical research findings concerning these IDs factors and their relationship with L2 writing and underscore the pragmatic implications of these findings for writing instruction, including the consideration of task complexit, learner proficiency, and the nature of feedback provided.

Chapter 8 by Rachael Ruegg attempts to show the significance of developing learner autonomy in writing and its benefits for students' motivation, engagement, and academic achievement. The author argues that autonomy-supportive teaching practices not only yield benefits for students but also enhance teachers' enjoyment of teaching. However, there are obstacles to implementing autonomy-supportive teaching, such as institutional reporting and standardization. Despite these challenges, the author believes that autonomy-supportive teaching provides students with choices and enables them to self-regulate their learning, which leads to increased competence, motivation, and engagement. The chapter concludes by advocating the implication of pedagogical trategies to foster learner autonomy in L2 writing..

Chapter 9 reviews the theory, research, and implications surounding collaborative writing in second/foreign language learning contexts. Tomohito Hiromori highlights the importance of collaboration in developing communication abilites and emphasizes the significance of collaborative writing in supporting second language acquisition through interaction and output activities. Therefore, collaborative writing is in line with communication-oriented teaching methods and the focus on form approach. Additionall, empirical studies on collaborative writing demonstrate that the nature and outcomes of collaborative writing are inluenced by factors such as task variables, learner variables, and the mode of communication inluence. In conclusion, the author proposes the pedagogical implications of collaborative writing, including enhancement of learner engagement and consideration of learner motivation and proficiency levels.

The next three chapters center on the vital role fedback in second language writing. In Chapter 10, Minh Thi Thuy Nguyen and Willy Renandya emphasize the importance of feedback in learning specificall focusing on written correctivefeedback (wCF) in L2 writing classrooms. The authors criticlly examine the efectivenessof WCF in improving L2 writing accuracy and explore different theoretical pesptives onthe value fWCF and differt type fWCF, such as direct, indirect and metlingustic fack, as well as focused and unfocused feedback. This study has practical implications for teachers, which include the considerations regarding the amount and type of correction, strategie for delivering WCF, and the benefits f allowing students o revise their work. Furthermore, teachers are encouraged to reflect on their feedback practices and undertak smallcale action rerch to identif the most ffective feedback approaches for ther students, but there is limited discsion on th mpact ofWCF on ther asect of writing, such as fluency and coherence.

In the subsequent chapter titled \*Insights into Dynamic Written Corrctive Feedback" by Kendon Kurzer, the proposition of using Dynamic Written Corrective Feedback (DwCF) emerges s a promising method to improve grammaticalaccuracy in L2 writing. DWCF focuses on manageable, meaningful, timely, and constant feedback practices and helps students transfer procedural knowledge, scaffold grammar feedback, and prioritize comprehensible input. The author examines the effectiveness of DwcF in addressing different types f rors, the role of indirect fdack, the use f explicit coing systems, and the tratment f untreatable grammatical features. Previous studies reveal positive outcomes of DwcF in terms of improving students' accuracy in writing. Additionall, the author provides several practical strategies for delivering DwCF, such as using a sample coding system for error correction and providing clear guidelines for students to submit edited draft. However, this chapter does not extensively discuss potential limitations or challenges associated with the implementation of DwCF.

Grant Eckstein in Chapter 12 analyses the efectivenessof feedback on student writing for L2 writers and examines three sources of feedback, i. teacher feedback, peer feedack, and self-feedback. The chapter discusses the theoretcl framework of L2 feedback practices within the field of composition studies and the shft from the product approach to the proces approach in writing instruction, which emphasizes planning, drafting, revising, and publishing. In adition, practical implications and recommendations regarding making effective feedback on L2 student writing are provided to early carer teachers. These recommendations include establishing feedback criteria, designing clear feedback, choosing when to comment on what, giving the right amount of feedback, selecting the right location for feedback, providing feedback in effctive forms, considering oral/audio feedback, and using peer feedback.

Chapter 13 investigates the impact of technology on teaching and learning writing. Yijen Wang and Ali Panahi claim that tech. nology has transformed the writing process with some positive apects, such as providing students with aces to a wide range of resource, facilitating collaboration and feedback, offerig real-time support and guidance, increasing publishing opportunities, and delivering efficient evaluation of writing outcomes. However, there are some concerns regarding ethical isues, over-reliance on AI tools and fairness of accessbilit. The authors further explore the integration of technology into writing istruction and the effectivenessof technology-supported writing instruction, revealing is role as a tutor for self-directed leaning and as a too to enhance the writing process.

In the concluding chapter, Ronald P. Leow and Rosa M. Manchon present an overview of recent shifs in second/foreign language writing reearch, focusing on the perspective f writing as a potentil for lening, proces-oriented approaches to the study of writing, and the integration of writing research within the language currculum. They review the theoretical framework concerning the language learning potential of L2 writing, the role of written corrctive feedback in L2 development, and studies on task-modality A search of current literature reveals a need for further investigation into language leaning outcomes, individual difference, and the role of task-related factors in writing processes.

Overall, Insights into Teaching and Leaning Writing is meritorious by virtue of its several distinctive features. Firstly, the book impresses with its clear organizational structure and reader-friendly writing style. Each chapter follows a consistent organizational pattern, beginning with the theoretical framework and literature review, followed by practical implications, and cloing with suggestions for action resarch or case studies, along with recommendations for further reading. This writig pattern facilitates readers quick understanding of the theoretical framework and empirical studies in diffrent domains of second language writing research. Moreover, the inlusio of aurther reding list at the end f each haptr rovides compelling aenues for redersto delve deer into research topics. Additionall, the book avoids the use of technical jargon, and the language used is easy to understand, making it accesibl to a wide audience. Secondly, the book is very comprehensive and timely, encapsulating the most rcent empirical studies on second language writing across a broad range of relevant research topics. The authors of each chapter are experts in different research topics and possessdiverse 2 educational backgrounds, thus providing varied perspectives on teaching and learning writing. Lastly, the book seamlessy integrates theory with practice and is renowned for it practice-oriented style. Each chapter includes a section on action research or case studies as examples, encouraging teachers t follow suit and conduct thir own action research. Ths approach allows educators to gain insights from existing theories and studies, bridge theory with practice, and identify and address challenges in their teaching practice through action research.

While this book serves as a valuable reference in the SLA literature and offers insights into second language writing, some areas could be improved upon despite is strengths. pecificall, the authors could enhance the pedagogical suggestions and potential action research by providing more concrete examples, especially in Chapters 4, 5, 11, and 12 where information about action research is limited or missing. This lack of clarity may make it challenging for readers to implement thesestrategie in their classrooms. Besides, adding a chapter dedicated to action research with specific examples related to writing would greatly benefit early career teachers seeking guidance on designing and conducting their own action research. Additionall, organizing the chapters into more systematic sections, such as teaching aproaches, writing assessments, and corrective feeback, would improve the book's readabilit and help readers navigat the content more efectively. Furthermore, the book overlooks important topics such as rhetorical paterns in writing. Including discussions on these overlooked aspects would provide a more comprehensive understanding of second language writing.

Despite the aforementioned limitations, this book remains a significant contribution to the field of second language writing and to the readership of Assesing Writing journal. It provides an up-to-date review of existing studies from theoretical, empiricl, and pedagogical pespectives. Therfore, langag teacher, ecially erl care tchrs, rerchrs, stdents, and reders interested in second language writing, can benefit substantially from this timely contribution.
