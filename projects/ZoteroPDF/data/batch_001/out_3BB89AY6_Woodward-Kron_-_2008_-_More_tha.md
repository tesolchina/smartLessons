# Abstract

Teachers of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and academic language and learning advisors have long recognised the importance of developing students’ academic vocabulary for successful writing and learning at university. There is little, however, in the EAP literature on the place of teaching and learning discipline specific vocabulary, despite the growing attention paid to differences in disciplinary discourses in the EAP field. This paper aims to raise awareness of the role of the specialist language of academic disciplines in learning disciplinary knowledge. It identifies the nature of specialist language in a learner discourse of one academic discipline as well as examines how students incorporate this specialist language in their writing as their disciplinary knowledge increases. The data are drawn from a longitudinal study of undergraduate Education students’ writing. The students’ incorporation of specialist language in their writing is explored through the concepts of technicality and abstraction as they have been developed within systemic functional linguistics.

The findings from this study show that learning specialist knowledge in pre-service teacher education involves adopting technical terms as well as coming to terms with the abstract dimension of the discourse. This paper also provides an analytical tool which can be adapted for examining the ways in which language represents experience in academic discourses. This analytical tool can assist academic language researchers and teachers to investigate variation in disciplinary discourses beyond the level of text organization and purpose so as to inform the teaching of specialist language.

# 1. Introduction

A long recognised component of teaching English for Academic Purposes (EAP) is developing students’ academic vocabulary. Vocabulary development tasks in EAP textbooks include exercises on formal language choices as opposed to everyday language, phrases to refer to the literature and to paraphrase or quote, Latin affixes and Greek and Latin roots, vocabulary to organise text (e.g. Nation 1990, 2001; Swales & Feak 1994) as well as exercises informed by concordance software and corpora (e.g. Thurston & Candlin 1997). Many EAP teacher reference books and textbooks which address teaching academic vocabulary emphasise the role of academic vocabulary for learning (e.g. Nation

2001); however, there appears to be little or no discussion of the role of the specialist language of students’ chosen discipline for learning nor any guidelines for teachers to understand the nature of the specialist language of different academic disciplines. While it can be argued that learning the specialist language of any discipline is more in the realm of English for English for Special/Specific Purposes (ESP) than EAP, all EAP students will encounter specialist disciplinary language once they commence their university studies. Furthermore, many EAP teachers and language and learning advisors have backgrounds in education and applied linguistics, yet in their work with students they regularly encounter unfamiliar disciplines and need to engage with the specialist language of those disciplines in their language advising role (Woodward-Kron & Jamieson 2007).

Another consideration is the cognitive load of specialist disciplinary language for students, particularly for students whose first language is not English. For science and biomedical students, a striking feature of scientific discourse is the presence of Graeco-Latinate affixes and roots in the technical terms, a feature which can create a barrier to comprehension. Specialist texts in the humanities, on the other hand, generally contain fewer unfamiliar technical terms than scientific discourse, yet they can be equally as difficult to comprehend due to the abstract way in which concepts and events are represented (Martin 1993a, 2002). The distinct specialist language of the disciplines and their different areas of difficulty are aspects of learning specialist knowledge which students need to come to terms with if they are to be successful in their studies. The different nature of the difficulty of these discourses for secondary students has been the focus of educational linguists working within a systemic functional linguistic framework (Coffin 1997; Derewianka 1995; Martin 1991, 1993a, 1993b, 1993c; Schleppergrell 2004a, 2004b; Wignell 1998, Wignell et al. 1993). In this body of work, the technical dimension of science discourses is referred to as ‘technicality’ and the abstract nature of humanities discourses as ‘abstraction’.

This paper’s aim is twofold: it aims to identify the nature of specialist language in one academic discipline, and to examine the role of the specialist language for learning disciplinary knowledge. This involves examining how undergraduate education students incorporated the specialist language of child development and learning in their assignment writing over a three year period. The concepts of technicality and abstraction from systemic functional linguistics were adopted to develop a framework for examining the nature of this discipline’s specialist language. This framework was used to examine how six students over a three year period incorporated this specialist language in their writing as their disciplinary knowledge increased. In this paper, the phrase ‘specialist language of the disciplines’ is used as a super-ordinate term to refer to distinctive disciplinary language. The term ‘specialist language’ is used instead of ‘terminology’ and ‘technical’ in order to avoid confusion with ‘technicality’, since technicality is used in a technical (defined) sense in the paper.

# 2. Context of the study and the student texts

This investigation of specialist language and its role for students’ disciplinary learning was part of a longitudinal study into students’ learning through writing in a Faculty of Education at one regional Australian university (Woodward-Kron 2002a). The data for the larger study were mainly students’ assignments collected over a three year period in an undergraduate primary teacher education degree course. The volunteer students were all English speaking background students. The assignment data were supplemented with student and tutor interviews as well as other contextual data such as course outlines and assessment criteria. The supplementary data contributed to a ‘thick’ description of the valued disciplinary discursive practices for undergraduate education students in the study context (Woodward-Kron 2002b, 2004, 2006). As examples from the student texts will be used in the description of the analytical framework in the following section, the student texts will be introduced first.

The assignments of six students from their first year and third year studies were selected (twelve assignments in total). The assignment selection sought to incorporate lower scoring texts as well as higher scoring as one of the research questions for the larger study was to examine differences in lexicogrammatical grammatical choices between higher scoring and lower scoring texts from a longitudinal perspective. The first year texts were written in response to an essay assignment asking students to consider the nature nurture debate on the course of child development (1000e1500 words). The third year essay assignment required students to decide which theories of children’s thinking and learning were most defensible for the students’ future role as primary teachers (2000 words). The assignments were initially analysed for generic structure and clause boundaries. Table 1 summarises the textual data.

The selected students’ grades ranged from Pass $( 5 0 \% - 6 4 \% )$ to High Distinction $( 8 5 \% - 1 0 0 \% )$ . In the discussion of the results, ‘lower scoring students’ is used to refer to the grades Pass and Credit while ‘higher scoring’ refers to the

# 3. Theoretical framework and analytical tools

The theoretical framework for this exploration of specialist language in student disciplinary writing is systemic functional linguistics as developed by Halliday (1985/1994 1979) and colleagues. One principle of systemic functional linguistics is that language performs a number of functions, including representing what is happening (or what did or will happen), interacting, and organising language into a coherent whole. As this paper is concerned with the names and labels of phenomena, theory, and how these are utilised in a learner educational discourse, the language function examined here is the way in which happenings or experience are represented through language. This section introduces the theoretical framework and analytical tools used to examine the ways in which the education students represent experience through language. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 introduce the concepts of the Participant in a clause and repackaging experience while Sections 3.3 and 3.4 focus on the concepts of technicality and abstraction, concepts which provide the framework for the analysis. The examples are from the trainee teachers’ texts.

# 3.1. Participants: the ‘things’ in the texts

The starting point for elaborating the ways in which language represents experience is the clause. From a functional perspective, the clause consists of a process, the participants in the process, and the circumstances associated with the process. For example:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Children</td><td>engage</td><td>in the classroom</td></tr><tr><td>Participant</td><td>Process</td><td>Circumstance</td></tr></table></body></html>

For the purposes of this paper, the focus of analysis is the participant - the ‘Thing1 ’ in the clause. Participants can be a person, place or an object2 . Grammatically speaking, the participant is mostly realised by a nominal group (i.e. children). In the above example, the Participant is a generic human participant, children; participants can also be abstract entities or things such as competence or intelligence. In the example, the Participant is a single word, but if more specificity is required, additional information can be added to the nominal group structure, e.g. the noisy children in the classroom. The nucleus of the nominal group is referred to as the Head. In the noisy children in the classroom example, the pre-modifying information in front of the Head, children, specifies ‘which children’ via the Deictic the, while the Epithet noisy provides information on a quality. Qualifying information can follow the Head in the form of a prepositional phrase (e.g. in the classroom) or clause (e.g. who were actively engaged in the task). Jones (1988) points out that much of the complexity in academic writing is built up in the nominal group, whose structure often includes a head noun with pre-modifying as well as post-modifying information. The modifying elements can consist of embedded clauses (finite and non-finite) and phrases, which add to the complexity. For example:

<html><body><table><tr><td>the child&#x27;s</td><td>attempt</td><td>[[to understand</td></tr><tr><td>Premodifier</td><td>Head</td><td>the world]] Postmodifier</td></tr></table></body></html>

# 3.2. Repackaging experience and incongruence in the grammar

Experience can be represented or packaged in the clause in a number of ways. For example, children engage in the classroom, consists of the doing process engage. However, the process of ‘engaging’ can also be presented as a Participant (engagement): for example, children’s engagement in the classroom is the goal of many teachers. In this example, the previous clause has been repackaged with the Circumstance and Process becoming the Participant while the Process is one of being/relating rather than doing. This repackaging of processes and events as participants is referred to as nominalisation (e.g. Butt, D., Fahey, R., Feez, S., Spinks, S. & Yallop C., 2000). Halliday (1978) points out that nominalisation can expand meaning potential; that is, processes can be condensed into entities and related to other things or entities in the environment of the clause. For example in clause i) below, the Participant and Process Piaget argued has been ‘repackaged’ in clause ii) as a nominal group, Piaget’s argument, through the process of nominalisation.

i) Piaget argued that learning came about through the child’s individual attempts to either assimilate or accommodate information.   
ii) Piaget’s argument that learning comes about through the child’s individual attempts to assimilate or accommodate information is.

Although the meaning in clause i) and the nominalised Participant in clause ii) is similar, Halliday and Martin (1993) point out that the change in rank in the grammar has implications for the ‘‘texture of the discourse’’ (p.39), particularly the textual development. The nominalisation opens up possibilities for distributing information in the clause. For example, ‘Piaget’s argument that learning.’ can be the point of departure for the clause (Theme). Experientially, the nominal group ‘Piaget’s argument that learning.’ can function as a Participant in a range of relational processes, thereby expanding the meaning potential of the clause. For example:

[to contrast] Piaget’s argument that learning comes about through the child’s individual attempts to assimilate or accommodate information contrasts with Vygotsky’s view that social interactions are crucial for development.

[to explain/to show causation] Piaget’s argument that learning comes about through the child’s individual attempts to assimilate or accommodate information has resulted in the development of teaching strategies to promote autonomous thinking.

# [to identify]

Piaget’s argument that learning comes about through the child’s individual attempts to assimilate or accommodate information is one of the most influential theories in child development.

[to evaluate]

Piaget’s argument that learning comes about through the child’s individual attempts to assimilate or accommodate information is a valid one.

Several researchers (e.g. Jones 1988, Schleppergrell 2004a, 2004b) into academic writing in English have pointed out the presence of nominalisation in successful student writing as well as commented on the challenge this ‘repackaging’ can be to students for non-English speaking backgrounds who may not have the linguistic repertoire for this kind of writing. As processes are repackaged as participants, academic texts become more abstract and complex, and much of the complexity is due to the nominal group structure (Jones 1988). Due to this feature of academic discourse, it is necessary to briefly elaborate on the relationship between the semantics and lexicogrammar from a systemic perspective as this has implications for the description and application of the analytical tools.

In systemic theory, language is a semiotic system (Halliday 1978) with three levels or strata of language. These subsystems are semantics, lexicogrammar and phonology or graphology. The discourse semantics (meanings) are realised through the lexicogrammar (wordings), which in turn is realised through the phonology or graphology (soundings or letters). The notion of language as a semantic system provides an important tool for investigating the ways in which language is used in particular contexts. For this study, the tri-stratal organisation of the model and the relation between the different strata is relevant as many of the meanings in academic discourses are incongruently realised through the grammar (e.g. Schleppergrell 2004a). That is, the relationship between the grammar and the semantics is not a natural one. Verbs are realised as Participants rather than Processes in the clause, causal relations are realised inside the clause rather than between the clause in the form of conjunction (e.g. The students improved because they were motivated), and so on. In systemic linguistics the reconstrual of congruent meanings in the grammar into more incongruent grammatical categories is referred to as grammatical metaphor. Educational linguistics have argued that the presence of grammatical metaphor in student writing at the secondary level (Coffin 1997; Derewianka 1995; Halliday & Martin 1993; Martin 1991, 1997, 2002; NSW Department of School Education 1996; Veel 1997, 1998) and in writing at university (Colombi 2002; Drury 1991; Jones 1988; Ravelli 2000; Schleppergrell 2004a, 2004b; Ventola 1997) is a key component of educational success. The presence of grammatical metaphor in the student texts, how it was realised, and its association with abstraction was important to identify and investigate to determine: i) whether it featured in the successful students’ writing as the literature suggests, and ii) whether it played a role in the specialist language of the learner educational discourse.

# 3.3. Technicality

Technicality is the use of terms with a specialised, field specific meaning (Wignell, P., Martin, J. R. & Eggins, S. 1993). Derewianka (1995) and Wignell et al. (1993) suggest that technicality is built up in a text through the defining of the phenomenon in question, in which the technical term acquires a precise, field specific meaning. Another function of technicality is to distil or compress meanings. Definitions are particularly important in fields such as education, which uses everyday, commonsense terms in technical, field-specific ways. The process of defining relates the commonsense terms to new technical ones (Martin 1993b) as in the examples from the education students’ texts below.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Nature</td><td>is understood to be</td><td>&quot;the hereditary information [we receive from our parents... [[that signals the body to grow and affects all our characteristics and skills&quot;ll Il (citation)..</td></tr><tr><td>Participant thing being defined.</td><td>Process</td><td>Participant definition</td></tr><tr><td>Whereas nurture</td><td>represents</td><td>&quot;the complex forces of the physical and social world [[that children encounter in their homes, neighbourhoods, schools, and communities&quot;&#x27;]] (citation)</td></tr><tr><td>Participant thing being defined</td><td>Process</td><td>Participant definition</td></tr></table></body></html>

In these examples, the Participants, the everyday concepts of nature and nurture, are assigned field-specific meanings associated with influences on child development. Another aspect of technicality is that technical terms imply specialist taxonomies, in which phenomena are not only given specialist meanings but are also systematically related to other phenomena (Wignell et al. 1993; Martin 1993a). For example:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Composition Taxonomy: (a is a part of b)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The triarchic theory of intelligence relies on three sub-theories:</td><td>Triarchic theorye</td><td>Componential theory</td></tr><tr><td>the componential, experiential and contextual.</td><td>of intelligence</td><td>Experiential theory</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Contextual theory</td></tr></table></body></html>

Therefore two means of identifying technical terms in the students’ texts were i) if the terms were defined and ii) if they were in a taxonomic relationship with other terms. Additionally, technical terms were sometimes indicated through orthographic means such as initial upper case letters (Nature, Nurture) and inverted commas (‘‘classical conditioning’’). The students also used acronyms (e.g. SCAMPER mnemonic, KLA’s, ZPD) to refer to technical concepts. Following White (1998), acronyms such as ZPD were considered as technical terms in this study. An initial analysis suggested that the majority of technical language in the students’ writing was specialist terms for concepts, processes as phenomena, teaching strategies, and theories. For example:

i) Concepts Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Ego-centric speech   
ii) Processes as phenomena Social learning Adaptation Maturation   
iii) Teaching strategies Scaffolding Divergent questioning Peer learning   
iv) Theories Ecological system theory Triarchic theory of intelligence Multiple intelligence theories

From a lexicogrammatical perspective, the technical terms listed for i) concepts, ii) processes as phenomena, and iii) teaching strategies have as their constituent structure a nominalised process as the Thing (i.e. the head noun in the nominal group). Although these reconstruals of processes could be interpreted as grammatical metaphor according to the discussion of grammatical metaphor in the previous section, they are viewed instead as abstract technical terms as they have a field specific meaning. As Derewianka (1995) points out, ‘‘grammatical metaphor may be implicated in the evolutionary phase of certain types of technical terms’’ (p. 230); however, such terms lose their metaphorical status once they become established within a particular field.

As well as the abstract dimension of these terms, it was noticeable from the initial analysis that a number of the nominalised Things included classifying information, for example, divergent questioning, ego-centric speech, dramatic play, and extrinsic motivation. In this study terms which had classifying elements in the nominal group structure were considered technical if the terms were unambiguously defined either in the text or inter-textually and exist in taxonomic relations to other phenomena (Wignell 1998).

The final point on technicality is to do with the presence of what will be referred to as semi-technical terms in the students’ texts. For the purposes of this study, semi-technical terms are concepts or phenomena that are central to the concerns of the discipline, yet which were not sufficiently defined or classified in a taxonomic relationship in the students’ writing to qualify as a technical term. Examples include creativity, teaching, learning, and development. As with the technical terms, semi-technical terms were not considered as examples of grammatical metaphor.

In summary, the criteria used for identifying technicality in the student were as follows:

i) technical term: defined   
ii) technical term: in a taxonomic relationship to other terms   
iii) semi technical term: not defined/classified but central to the concerns of the discipline

To measure technicality, the full texts of the students were used in order to gain an accurate measure of the extent of technicality in the students’ writing and to assess whether technicality increased as students’ disciplinary knowledge increased. Technical terms were counted once.

# 3.4. Abstraction

The previous section on technicality has established a framework for examining the specialist language of teacher education and child education, yet the focus on technicality tells only part of the story. Participants in this educational discourse are both human as well as abstract entities. A focus only on defined terms and taxonomies would not reveal the role of theorists and researchers in shaping and constructing disciplinary knowledge nor would it reveal the ways in which the students transfer this knowledge to the classroom in their roles as future teachers. Furthermore, it would neglect the critical and analytical dimension of the learner discourse: that is, how students synthesise knowledge and engage with the issues, ideas and controversies in the discipline (Woodward-Kron 2002b). For these reasons, the concept of abstraction is examined.

‘Abstractness’ has traditionally been considered in a contrastive relationship to concreteness. Corson (1985), however, argues against simplistic descriptions of abstractness:

‘Abstract’ is not an absolute notion; the traditional concrete-abstract dichotomy is better regarded as a continuum along which there are different kinds of abstractness. (Corson 1985: 104)

In the students’ texts, initial analysis showed that the same term can signify a concrete entity in one instance, and a more abstract entity or concept in another instance. For example:

When I asked the child to repeat what I had said (he was now facing the back of the room), he repeated everything I had said word for word.

A supportive classroom is one where students are recognised and valued as individuals with different strengths and weaknesses, different abilities, and different talents.

For this reason when analysing the type of technical term, it was necessary to consider the term in the context of the clause.

The criteria to identify abstraction in the students’ texts were adopted from Martin’s (1997: 30) network of Thing types (Fig. 1). This network provides a means of distinguishing between concrete items (both specific and generic), abstractions, technical terms (including technical abstractions), and grammatical metaphor in the students’ texts. The categories of abstract semiotic and abstract generic Thing types are important inclusions as they allow for the identification of students’ engagement with concepts and concerns or issues in the discipline. Abstract semiotic refers to terms to do with meanings and thinking such as idea, concept, theory, while abstract generic refers to non-specific abstract concepts such as problem. The metaphoric branch of the network allows for the identification of grammatical metaphor in terms of Thing types in the student texts. Metaphoric: Processual refers to reconstruals of Processes (e.g. to approach) through nominalisation to Things (e.g. the approach) while Metaphoric: Quality refers to qualities or attributes (e.g. strong) which have been reconstrued as Things (e.g. strength). The addition to Martin’s network is the branch of abstract semi-technical Thing types. Another modification is the arrows, which indicate the continuum dimension between some concrete and abstract concepts such as classroom.

While the whole texts were used to measure technicality, to measure abstraction an extract was taken from the Argument stage of the students’ expository texts. In the students’ texts, the Argument stage was identified as including sub-stages of Point, Elaboration (Woodward-Kron 2006). Frequently, the Point, Elaboration structure corresponded to the orthographic division of a paragraph. An example of a Point, Elaboration excerpt with analysis for Thing types is provided in the Appendix. Only the Thing in each nominal group was included; however, the expanded nominal group was included for technical terms in order to distinguish between technical and semi-technical terms. Each Thing type was considered in context as the same term could represent different Thing types. For example, (the Thing in each example is in bold script):

Thing type: abstract generic: the social and cultural nature of development

Thing type: abstract technical: Nature is the type of development that .

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Technicality

The results for technicality are discussed in terms of the function of technicality in the students’ texts, that is, defining and ordering (classifying), as well as in terms of frequency.

The students’ defining of technical terms in the discipline of child development contributes to their understanding of the factors that influence a child’s social, physical and cognitive development and their implications for learning. The technical terms which were defined in the students’ texts are shown in Table 2. The results for technicality and defining show that while definitions are present in the students’ texts, they are not a predominant feature. As Table 2 shows, five of the twelve texts include three or fewer definitions per text while two of the higher scoring texts have no definitions (Annie 1st year, Alice, 3rd year).

Definitions can be viewed as having a ‘knowledge telling’ function: they demonstrate to the tutor that the student can explain the concept. In some student texts, however, definitions also functioned for the student as a means of clarifying or reminding. In i) below, the definition, was provided as an additional nominal group which elaborated on or ‘glossed’ the term being defined. In ii), the definition was provided in the non-defining relative clauses. These definitions can be seen as explanations, functioning as a gloss or reminder to the student of the term’s meaning.

Self-directed learning where students help control the pace and content of their learning is a principle I would employ to achieve both these goals.

Not all students managed to define technical terms adequately, for example:

Albert Bandura introduced observational learning the most influential study was devised by Bandura (citation) on how children imitate and model. Bandura (citation) conducted an experiment with two groups of children one group showed a woman hitting a life size plastic doll. The other group was shown a woman playing quietly with a doll. When the woman left both groups played with the dolls in the same manner that was shown to them by copying the women’s behaviour. The theory being that the behaviour was learnt through watching the woman and imitating her behaviour (citation). $[ 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ year, Alice, $\mathrm { P } { + } ]$

Alice uses an instant of a phenomenon to define a technical concept rather than generalising from the instant: that is, The theory [observational learning] being that the behaviour was learnt through watching the woman and imitating her behaviour. The mechanism of grammatical metaphor would have assisted Alice to shift from the instant to the general. For example:

<html><body><table><tr><td>the student&#x27;s definition:</td><td>alternative realisation:</td></tr><tr><td>[[that the behaviour</td><td>the learning</td></tr><tr><td>was learnt through watching the woman and imitating her behaviour]</td><td>of behaviours through</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>observation and imitation</td></tr><tr><td>RANK-SHIFTED PROCESSES WITH SPECIFIC PARTICIPANTS</td><td>NOMINAL GROUP WITH NOMINALISED ABSTRACTIONS</td></tr></table></body></html>

An alternative textualisation adopting a relating process to define and grammatical metaphor to distill information is as follows.

DEFINING

Observational learning refers to the learning of behaviours through observation and imitation.

The extract from Alice’s text shows a number of grammatical infelicities, including non-finite clauses punctuated as sentences. Correcting these problems in her text, however, would neither greatly improve the text, nor make the text more authoritative. In Alice’s text, greater awareness of how grammar construes definitions would have assisted the development of the text, as well as helped to clarify the students’ thinking. Grammatical metaphor would help to assist Alice to distil information in order to move from specific instances to generalisations.

The results for technicality and ordering (classifying) show that the students’ incorporation of technical terms enabled them to order and classify the experiential world of child development. In the student texts taxonomic relations were realised at clause level as well as through the unfolding of the text (Woodward-Kron 2006). The students also established taxonomic relations in their texts by utilising the potential of the nominal group, usually in a Classifier^Thing configuration.

For example:

Classifier^Thing constructivist education reciprocal teaching cooperative learning intrinsic motivation extrinsic motivation

An overview of the frequency of technicality in the students’ texts is provided in Table 3. The most striking feature of this result is the increase in technicality between the first year and the third year texts. While the third year texts were approximately 500e1000 words longer than the third year texts, all the students at least doubled the amount of technical items in their texts. This finding is by no means a surprising one, as the first year texts were written within the students first weeks of study and the third year texts were written after two and a half years of learning about child development theories and implications of those theories for teaching and learning. The findings, however, provide quantitative evidence that learning specialist knowledge involves learning technical terms and necessitates adopting those terms in the students’ assignments.

There was little difference between the amount of technicality in the lower scoring texts and the higher scoring texts. The average number of technical items in the first year lower and high scoring texts was 3.3. The average number of technical items in the third year texts was 14.5 for the two lower scoring texts (Kay and Jean), and 15 for the remaining four higher scoring texts. One noticeable finding, however, was the absence of any technical terms Annie’s text, the highest scoring first year text. This text however is prominent in the following discussion of abstraction.

# 4.2. Abstraction

The results of the Thing type analysis showing the amount and type of abstraction is shown in Fig. 2 (1999) and Fig. 3 (2001). These figures also show the number of concrete items and amount of grammatical metaphor in the students’ texts. In contrast to the results for technicality which showed the results for individual students, the results for abstraction are collated into averages for the lower scoring texts and the higher scoring texts for each branch of network. The lower scoring spectrum refers to grades within the Pass and Credit range while higher scoring are Distinction and High Distinction grades. A sample analysis of a student’s text using the Thing type network is provided as an Appendix.

The results of the analysis of Thing types show that while the discourse of child development and teaching and learning is predominantly abstract, it has a distinct concrete dimension. This is due to the presence of specific human participants in the text as well as generic human participants. The specific human participants were theorists and researchers in the field as well as the first person I, which functioned to construe the student/writer as a future teacher in the text and to allow the student to make explicit, subjective judgements on the saliency of theories for classroom practice. Specific human participants appeared in all of the first year texts as well as the third year texts. In first year, there were an average of 4.6 occurrences of specific human participants in the lower scoring texts and 4.0 in the higher scoring texts (Fig. 2). In third year, this increased slightly to 6.0 per text for lower scoring and 6.2 for higher scoring texts (Fig. 3).

Generic human participants were another significant concrete aspect of the texts. Generic participants representing the institutional roles of the participants, such as teachers, learners, students and educators, were a distinctive feature of the both the first and third year texts. In first year, lower scoring texts had an average of 10.3 generic human participants and 7.3 in the higher scoring texts. In third year, this increased to 12.0 in the lower scoring and 12.2 in the higher scoring texts. Other generic human participants were ‘knowledge makers’, such as theorists and researchers, and human participants who influenced children’s learning and development such as peers and parents. Concrete generic objects were rare in the texts and featured either as figures of speech, such as in the simile as a window to development; as tabula rasa, or as lexical metaphors such as tools, goals. One exception was classroom, which featured in several of the third year texts. In particular, ‘types of classrooms’, for example a classroom that is social, a classroom that challenges students etc. were sub-headings in Annie’s High Distinction scoring third year text. In other words, classroom functioned as a means of organising the student’s text.

While concrete Thing types were an intrinsic feature of the students’ texts, abstract Thing types occurred with a higher frequency. Semiotic abstract Thing types, that is, terms for generic dimensions of meanings such as idea and knowledge, occurred in the first year and third year lower scoring as well as higher scoring texts. The category of generic abstract Thing types contained the highest averages of the four sub-categories of abstract Thing types. This category included a number of terms to do with research activities such as studies, method, findings, evidence, results, as well as terms to do with classroom activities such as activities and tasks. It also included terms which can be broadly described as to do with analysis: that is, terms that refer to part-whole relations such as type, aspect, element, component and terms with an explanatory function such as purpose, reason and way. These abstract generic terms featured with greater frequency in the higher scoring first year texts compared to the lower scoring texts (Fig. 2), that is, 15.3 in the higher scoring texts and 8.6 in the lower scoring texts, but in the third year texts (Fig. 3) there was little difference between the two averages.

Technical Thing types were not prominent in either the first or the third year texts, scoring the lowest average for any of the Thing types. Also, there was little difference between the results for technical Thing types between the

higher and lower scoring texts. Semi-technical Thing types featured more frequently than technical s in the first and third year texts. There was little difference between the averages scored for the higher and lower ranking texts. The results for the metaphoric Thing types show a slightly higher average for the higher scoring texts in both first year and third year. There is also an increase in occurrences of metaphoric Thing types in the third year texts.

The total average number of specific and generic concrete Things in the students’ texts was considerably lower than the total number of abstract and metaphoric Things in the texts. That is, the total average number of concrete Things for the first year texts was 14.9 for the lower scoring texts, and 11.3 for the higher scoring texts (Fig. 2 e total). In contrast, the total average number of abstract and metaphoric Things was 22.5 for the lower scoring texts, and 30.5 for the higher scoring texts (Fig. 3 e total). A similar contrast between concrete and abstract was evident in the third year texts. That is, the lower scoring concrete average was 18.0 with 18.4 for the higher scoring average, while the total average number for abstract and metaphoric items for the lower scoring texts was 29.0 and 35.0 for the higher scoring texts. In other words, in the first and third year texts abstract and metaphoric Things were more predominant than concrete Things, with both the lower and higher scoring third year texts showing an increase in the number of abstract and metaphoric items.

The results for the analysis of Thing types allow several observations about the discourse of child development and teaching and learning to be made. Firstly, the discourse has a distinct concrete dimension. This concrete dimension is in part due to reference to specific theorists and researchers who have contributed to disciplinary knowledge. Key disciplinary theorists such as Vygotsky and Piaget are referred to in all the students’ texts. This concrete ‘human’ element of the discourse of child development makes visible the constructed dimension of much disciplinary knowledge. Another feature that adds to the concrete dimension of the students’ texts is the use of the first person pronoun. I functioned in the students’ texts to construe the student/writer as a future teacher. This feature of the learner texts suggests that the students construe themselves as participants in the field, engaging with theories and transferring theories to classroom contexts. This finding has implications for the ways in which instructors, tutors and learning skills lecturers advise students on interpersonal aspects of their assignment writing. That is, advisors need to recognise that not all disciplines value an impersonal authorial stance when the implications of theory for practice are discussed.

A further comment on the concrete and abstract dimension of this learner disciplinary discourse as it was realised in the students’ texts has to do with transfer. It was evident that several terms such as classroom and nature had both concrete and abstract realisations. This dual dimension of many of the abstract concepts in child development and learning is also an important factor in the trainee teachers’ learning. Students need to transfer abstract concepts such as scaffolding and peer learning to classroom situations so that the abstract concepts are instantiated as processes and become part of the trainees’ teaching practices. This transferral involves shunting from abstract to concrete concepts, and from abstract concepts to concrete and abstract processes. Wignell (1998) refers to abstraction as ‘‘moving from an instance or collection of instances, through generalisation to abstract interpretation’’ (p.301).

# 5. Conclusion

Lay people may dismiss the specialist language of a discipline or profession as jargon. However, the specialist language of a discipline is intrinsic to students’ learning of disciplinary knowledge; students need to show their understanding of concepts, phenomena, relations between phenomena etc. by incorporating the specialist language and terminology of their discipline into their writing accurately. They also need to adopt the specialist language in order to make meaning and engage with disciplinary knowledge. This paper has demonstrated that adopting the specialist language of the discipline is intrinsic to learning disciplinary knowledge.

In terms of the nature of the educational discourse as instantiated in the trainee teachers’ texts, the findings suggest that the discourse of child development and teaching and learning is both technical and abstract. The findings also suggest that abstractions are implicated in the technical terms of the discourse of child development as was the case in sociology (Wignell 1998). One function of technicality in the students’ texts was to incorporate definitions; these definitions had both a knowledge telling function as well as the function of clarifying or reminding students about new disciplinary concepts, a function which can also occur at the textual level of generic stages in learner discourses (Woodward-Kron 2006). For some of the lower scoring students in this study, greater awareness of the ways in which grammar construes definitions would have assisted the development of the students’ text as well as clarified their thinking.

Grammatical metaphor was implicated in assisting the students to distil information in order to move from specific instances to generalisations. Technicality was also shown to have an ordering function, enabling the students to order and classify the experiential world of child development through language. The findings for abstraction showed that learning disciplinary knowledge also involves coming to terms with the abstract dimension of the discourse. It was in the findings for Thing types that differences between experiential meanings in the lower scoring and the higher scoring texts began to emerge. In general, the higher scoring students incorporated more abstract generic Thing types than their lower scoring colleagues.

The analytical tool described in this paper developed within the theoretical framework of systemic functional linguistics can be adapted to disciplinary contexts. This tool can assist academic language researchers to investigate variation in disciplinary discourses beyond the level of text organization and contextual purpose. As well as examining abstraction and technicality, this framework for analysing technicality and abstraction allows researchers and practitioners to examine in detail how different academic disciplines represent and interpret experience. Such findings would provide useful insights to language and learning practitioners who regularly negotiate meanings in unfamiliar disciplinary territory in their work supporting students’ writing.
