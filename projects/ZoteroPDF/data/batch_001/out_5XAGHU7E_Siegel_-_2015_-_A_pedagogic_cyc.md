# A pedagogic cycle for EFL note-taking

Joseph Siegel

More attention has been given to note-taking in EFL classrooms in recent years, probably due to growing numbers of EFL students who attend lectures given in English and the importance of note-taking during language proficiency tests. While textbooks and materials for note-taking practice are readily available, classroom techniques for teaching EFL note-taking abilities are far less abundant. To address the gap in EFL pedagogy, this study investigated a scaffolded, step-by-step instructional cycle for EFL note-taking, beginning with decisions about what, when, and how to record information in conjunction with a formal outline format during lecture listening. Eighty-seven intermediate-level Japanese university EFL learners completed pre- and post-instruction notetaking tasks and a questionnaire related to the instruction. Findings showed that learners recorded more information units and adopted a more visually accessible note-taking format following the instruction. Moreover, they viewed the pedagogical cycle as practical and beneficial.

The importance of note-taking skills for EFL students and teachers is increasing, with the attraction of attending English lectures while studying abroad, the increase of English-medium courses offered in EFL contexts, and the importance of note-taking on internationally recognized tests like TOEFL and IELTS. As such, courses with titles like ‘Academic listening’, ‘Lecture listening’, and ‘Listening and note-taking’ have become popular, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels. From a teacher’s point of view, notes provide visual representations of aural comprehension and are a tool to monitor student ability and uptake. Learners also benefit from taking notes, not only because the act engages them with the incoming speech of the lecturer/speaker (i.e. the encoding effect) but also because it generates an external record that they can use for future tasks and review (i.e. the storage effect) (for example Dunkel 1988; Piolat, Olive, and Kellogg 2005). To meet the current demand for EFL note-taking, materials creators and textbook publishers have been producing coursebooks accompanied by semi-authentic (or even authentic) audio and video lectures.

Despite the popularity of EFL note-taking, few descriptions of corresponding instructional practices exist in the literature, and guidance from teacher manuals or teacher training programmes is in short supply.

Classroom practice that asks students to ‘write what you hear’ or ‘note key words’ seems too general and simplistic. Approaches like these fail to recognize the complexity of taking notes and to present the skill in suitably sized tasks that instructors consider teachable and that learners find achievable and useful. While the importance of note-taking practice cannot be denied, as Hamp-Lyons (1983) observes, to be effective a notetaking programme needs to first teach effective and appropriate ways of taking notes. In the more than 30 years since Hamp-Lyons (ibid.) made this observation, ample note-taking materials have been produced, but pedagogical methods have lagged far behind. Taking notes involves coordinating multiple mental and physical processes under severe time constraints (Piolat et al. op.cit.). Therefore, it is little wonder that EFL learners struggle to do it successfully in their L2.

In an effort to address the need for pedagogy that focuses on the stages of note-taking, this article reports findings of a study that introduced explicit, scaffolded note-taking instruction in one-way (i.e. lecture) listening using a formal outline format. It investigates whether the skill of note-taking for EFL learners can be separated into its constituent parts, practised, developed, and recombined. This article describes the notetaking instruction, discusses research findings, and uses examples of student work to illustrate changes in note-taking behaviour stimulated by the instruction, with the hope of encouraging further investigations and discussion for EFL note-taking preparation.

The act of taking notes consists of a complex and (near) simultaneous sequence of mental and physical actions that occur under time pressure. These include comprehending aural input, identifying important information, and recording that information in some way (Piolat et al. op.cit.). Working memory (Piolat et al. op.cit.) also plays a crucial role. Other individual factors that impact on note-taking include attitude, mood, background knowledge, and cognitive ability (for example Dunkel op.cit.). However, the listener first needs to successfully unpack the series of fast incoming acoustic sounds and, from those sounds, interpret meaning. As expressed by students, teachers, and researchers alike, the ability to listen in a second or foreign language is one of the most daunting tasks learners face (for example Field 2008). Only after successful listening occurs can attention be turned to the next stages of the note-taking process. Thus, notetaking presents a unique challenge for EFL learners as well as their teachers.

In theoretical terms, taking notes serves two functions. First, the encoding aspect may contribute to learning and idea retention by activating and stimulating a listener’s attention (for example Kobayashi 2005). The encoding of information in written form represents the process of note-taking. The second function is to create an external repository of information for future study and review, which forms the product of note-taking. While the product of note-taking is certainly crucial, the process of note-taking (i.e. the complex sequence of cognitive and physical operations) may be underdeveloped in terms of classroom pedagogy. That is, teachers may assume that learners have already acquired the processes for EFL note-taking, and therefore neglect their development. They may focus solely on the finished product, but not how to produce it.

Note-taking is a cognitively demanding activity, even when doing so in the L1. In a meta-analysis of 57 note-taking studies, Kobayashi (ibid.) found that positive instructional interventions (for example pre-training in note-taking skills or use of framework notes) did not lead to consistent benefits. Furthermore, his review found that use of multimedia input (for example from a lecturer speaking and using visual material) can interfere with the quality and quantity of notes by distracting listeners or dividing their attention between aural and visual information (Kobayashi ibid.). Regarding the outline format specifically, Bui and McDaniel (2015) note that results are mixed, although they found a quantitative advantage for participants who used outlines. Song (2011) summarizes previous research involving L1 note-taking, stating that the outline format may be more effective than a blank format. Given these conflicting accounts from L1 research, the lack of pedagogy for L2 classrooms regarding note-taking is far from surprising.

Previous studies of note-taking abilities have shown, unsurprisingly, that EFL learners often struggle to record the same types and amount of information that L1 users do. In Clerehan’s (1995) comparison of L1 and L2 note-takers, the L2 group recorded noticeably fewer main headings, subheadings, and examples than did the L1 users. Another study found that L2 note-takers were only able to record approximately 30 per cent of propositions in lectures (Kiewra, Benton, Kim, Risch, and Christensen 1995). These studies indicate deficiencies in L2 note-taking. Yet the skill is closely linked to learner proficiency and progress. For example, Song’s (op.cit.) study demonstrated a strong indication that L2 students’ ability to differentiate between main topics, sub-topics, and details and subsequently organize their notes according to these categories corresponds to strong performances on listening tests.

While these studies highlight differences between L1 and L2 note-takers and suggest the important role note-taking ability has for L2 learners, they do not address the consequential issue of how to help learners develop note-taking skills in an L2. Classroom pedagogy for note-taking in the EFL classroom has long been overlooked. This is particularly the case in Japan, the context of the present study, as many Japanese students may not receive explicit note-taking instruction in either their L1 or in English before entering university (Crawford 2015).

Many teachers of EFL listening and note-taking classes may typically follow the course plans laid out by textbooks, covering various formats for taking notes along with strategies like employing abbreviations and symbols. Textbook publishers have invested time and effort in developing courses that are straightforward to teach, with the aim of improving both listening and note-taking. Well-planned materials and teaching mark a positive end to the spectrum of note-taking instruction. At the other end lies a much more alarming option: the hollow, negligent instruction of simply ‘take notes’, an approach that assumes learners implicitly know, or will eventually pick up, note-taking abilities in their L2. Therefore, an important distinction must be made between ‘teaching’ and ‘practising note-taking. The latter often occupies more class time than the former. While practice is clearly important to a learner’s success, one may wonder whether any instruction of note-taking is taking place. Therefore, this study introduced a pedagogic cycle for taking notes that focused on the individual stages of the note-taking procedure (for example deciding what and when to record).

The participants were $8 7$ intermediate-level Japanese university EFL students in three classes who received note-taking instruction once a week (approximately 30 minutes per session) for six weeks during the 15-week semester. Students at this university take EFL courses in preparation for English-medium classes in their majors. As such, the majority of learners are highly motivated to develop their English abilities. The note-taking instruction was added to an EFL lecture listening and discussion course that focused on different topics each week (for example ‘Education’ and ‘Leadership’). Course materials consisted of authentic video content, such as television programmes and documentaries, which were split into 1–2 minute segments with accompanying listening and discussion activities. For research purposes, students completed note-taking activities before and after the instruction, and a questionnaire. These data were used to address the following research questions:

1 Does explicit scaffolded note-taking instruction affect the quantity of information units (IUs) contained in notes taken by Japanese university EFL learners?   
2 Does explicit scaffolded note-taking instruction affect the format of notes taken by Japanese university EFL learners?   
3 What are the views of Japanese EFL university learners regarding explicit scaffolded note-taking instruction for the outline format?

For instructional purposes, I created six semi-authentic lectures based on course topics (for example ‘Leadership’ and ‘Education’). This allowed me to match lecture content to the themes of the course, keep rate of speech relatively consistent, and deliver information in a manner suitable for taking notes using an outline format (i.e. with clear main heading, sub-topics, and examples). Regarding lecture content, I researched related topics online (for example a biography of US senator John McCain for the Leadership topic, and differences between German and US education systems for the Education topic) and noted key words from my reading. In an effort to make each of the five-minute recordings more natural, I spoke using only my key word notes, as suggested by Flowerdew and Miller (1997). Thus, each recording included features of spontaneous speech, such as repetitions and hesitations. I also transcribed the lectures for in-class use and created ‘skeleton notes’ (i.e. note outlines), a pedagogic practice recommended by Dunkel (op.cit.).

The outline format was chosen because it aids the formation of internal connections between superordinate and subordinate or supporting information (for example Kiewra et al. op.cit.). In addition, I felt comfortable demonstrating the format in class and believe that the outline format is transferable and applicable to a number of different situations and content types, whereas other forms, such as illustrative diagrams, may be limited to certain topics (for example Bui and McDaniel op.cit.). Therefore, it would potentially benefit learners both in this and other classes and situations. The outlines consisted of three levels (main headings, subheadings, and examples) in order to help learners distinguish between levels of generalization, which, according to Piolat et al. (op.cit.), is the most crucial skill in taking notes. Each outline had a number of anchor points that helped learners follow the lectures and enabled them to reorient if they got lost. Each week, the skeleton notes got barer and the anchor points fewer (see Appendix for examples of skeleton notes from Weeks 2 and 6). In other words, the scaffolding was slowly retracted and learners were challenged to do more of the note-taking themselves.

The scaffolded instruction focused on the various stages of note-taking as displayed in Table 1, which also includes other activities learners did in class apart from completing note templates.

The purpose of separating the note-taking task into constituent parts was to present the focus as an achievable and scaffolded activity. Rather than continually practise the entire note-taking operation at once, this approach was meant to explore the extent to which the underlying stages can be developed in the EFL context. The focus was not to just simply ‘take notes’. Instead, I wanted to emphasize that taking notes (literally the writing of information) is the last part of a procedure that begins with listening (for pedagogic approaches to EFL listening, see, for example, Siegel 2015a; Field op.cit.). The procedure then moves on to cognitive decision-making at various levels and concludes with recording information in writing. Each time a new stage was introduced as the focus, learners were encouraged to add it to the previous stages.

For the pre- and post-instruction note-taking activities, I created semi-authentic audio lectures on two African countries (Namibia and Mozambique) in the same way as the lectures used in the instructional phase. These topics were intentionally chosen to offset any potential influence of background knowledge. In other words, it was felt that all Japanese learners in this context would have little previous knowledge about these countries, and thus would need to take notes on the unknown information. Students listened to these lectures once and were instructed to take notes. As motivation, they received ‘participation points’ based on the level of note completeness.

Notes were collected and analysed in three ways:

total number of IUs completeness format adoption.

An IU represents the smallest detached item of information that can, on its own, be judged as true or false (for example Dunkel op.cit.) and is a term commonly used in studies of note-taking. Examples included ‘14 weeks of summer vacation’ and ‘school day finishes at 1 pm’. The pre- and postinstruction lecture texts each included 57 IUs. Completeness was determined by dividing the number of IUs in student notes by the total number of possible IUs. Format adoption was measured by a qualitative visual inspection of the notes. The number of students who used the outline format before and after the instruction was compared. Data for these calculations are displayed in Table 2. Following the instruction period, learners also completed a survey asking about the usefulness of such pedagogy.

Findings Quantitative findings

Data regarding the total number of IUs, completeness, and format adoption are displayed in Table 2.

A $t$ -test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the number of IUs recorded on the pre- and post-instruction notes $( t = - 8 . 0 \mathrm { I } )$ . These data suggest that the increase in IUs was not by chance, although this study cannot claim that this increase resulted from the notetaking instruction, improvements in listening comprehension over the six-week period, or a combination of both.

Qualitative findings

A general format comparison of the pre- and post-instruction notes indicated that a majority of students adopted the outline format on the post-task. Whereas only 8 per cent of learners used an outline format on their pre-instruction notes, that number increased to 69 per cent on the post-task. Samples from two learners who adopted the outline format are shown in Figures $_ { \mathrm { I } - 4 }$ . In both cases, the outline format seems to have allowed both Student A and Student B to record more information and to do so in an arguably more accessible arrangement. As evident in these examples, students recorded information mostly in English with some low frequency words (such as African countries and geographic features) written in katakana (the Japanese phonetic alphabet for foreign words). Some, like Student A, attempted to write whole sentences or even every single word from the lecture on the pre-task, which can be viewed as an unattainable goal that may detract from listening comprehension resources. Moreover, this example demonstrates improved decisionmaking about what to record (i.e. more content words and fewer function words), resulting in higher information density. Student B was also able to record more IUs when the outline format was adopted in the post-task in a format that suggests superordinate and subordinate relationships.

# Questionnaire

On a post-instruction questionnaire, learners responded to eight items about their confidence when taking notes, the usefulness of the note-taking instruction, and their opinions about using the outline style in the future. More than half (62 per cent) responded that they were more comfortable taking notes after the instruction described above. A total of 71 per cent found the instruction either ‘useful’ or ‘very useful’. Students felt that the note-taking practice would help them when listening to lectures (83 per cent), writing essays or reports (37 per cent), organizing ideas (34 per cent), and preparing for presentations (19 per cent). When asked if they thought this note-taking instruction would help them in English-medium courses and lectures, 71 per cent responded ‘yes’. These survey results suggest that the note-taking instruction involved more than simply practising learners’ existing listening and note-taking abilities, as the majority reported that they would be able to apply the targeted skills in the future.

# Discussion

Findings from this study can begin to address the research questions related to quantity and format of notes, and student views of the pedagogy. The quantity of notes on the post-instruction task was significantly higher than that on the pre-task, suggesting that the staged pedagogic cycle had some positive effect. A total of 69 per cent of post-task notes were in outline format, which these learners chose to employ without instructions to do so. As such, there seems to be an instructional effect that caused a notable number of learners to adopt the outline format that had been practised in class. Based on this preliminary analysis, the step-by-step teaching of note-taking sub-skills (i.e. decision-making, using scaffolded ‘skeleton notes’) helped learners record more information and do so in what may be considered a more organized and accessible fashion, although this later claim is debatable. Through questionnaire responses, learners also stated that the instruction was practical and that they would be able to adopt it in other English note-taking situations. As this instructional sequence drew on learners’ cognitive decision-making skills more deeply than simple instructions to ‘take notes’, learners’ ability to distinguish between important and less important information in English probably increased.

Therefore, this pedagogic cycle indicates that note-taking instruction can consist of scaffolded attention to specific stages of the process. Such instruction goes beyond general directions to ‘take notes’ and engages L2 learners with the same processes they probably go through when taking notes in their L1. In other words, it is possible to teach note-taking skills rather than merely provide practice opportunities. Due to the differences in language processing ability, guidance and discussion with the teacher about appropriate decisions, in conjunction with skeleton notes, can lead to positive outcomes.

This manner of instruction may make note-taking in a foreign language seem more manageable, even to lower ability learners, as the skeleton notes can lead to task achievability and motivation. It also reinforces the notion that not all parts of a lecture are equally important and that verbatim comprehension and recording is not essential. Rather than beginning note-taking instruction with a daunting task, such as listening to a lecture and recording on a blank piece of paper, the cycle suggested in this article starts with the more manageable tasks of following a transcript and making decisions about what should and should not be noted. In doing so, it starts with the first stage of note-taking and builds upon this in subsequent sessions.

Despite these promising results, some issues need to be addressed beyond this present study. First, recording notes from aural input is inextricably linked to listening comprehension. During the semester, learners’ listening comprehension most likely improved through accessing course audio and video materials, listening to the teacher and fellow students in an English-only environment, and exposure to English outside the classroom (for example via the internet, English-speaking friends, etc.). Researchers undertaking studies involving listening invariably face the challenge of separating language exposure in and beyond the classroom (Siegel 2015b). Therefore, it remains unclear whether it was students’ improving listening skills, or the note-taking instruction, or both, that contributed to the results of this study.

Furthermore, it must be remembered that notes are meant to be, first and foremost, meaningful to the note-taker, rather than an outside observer. Thus, some parts of the notes may have meaning for the individuals concerned but were not scored as complete IUs. Moreover, it can be difficult to define ‘correct’ or ‘appropriate’ notes. Learners

in this study were given credit for misspellings, as was done in Crawford’s (op.cit.) study. Examples included ‘red’ for ‘lead’, ‘eizu’ for ‘AIDS’, and ‘vantu’ for ‘Bantu’, when these approximations appeared in conjunction with other IU content. Finally, implications related to language choice (i.e. in the L1 or L2) in note-taking need to be explored further.

Another consideration is that this study focused solely on pen-andpaper note-taking completed while listening to audio recordings. The research design did not account for the impact of technology on notetaking practices. Information delivery methods are changing through the use of multiple modes of input (for example speech, slides, and video). These multiple streams of information may be supportive for learners but could also interfere with note-taking. In addition, the use of laptop computers, cell phones, and tablets may help note-takers record more information than the traditional handwritten method (Bui, Myerson, and Hale 2013). Roy, Brine, and Murasawa (2014: 23) investigated ways EFL users interacted with various note-taking software programs and suggest that note-taking applications could lead to higher ‘proficiency in notetaking, listening and selective exposure to details’. Given the increasing influence of technology in language teaching, these alternatives to standard methods should be explored.

Many EFL educators appreciate seeing their students take notes. It feels satisfying to see learners engaged in aural decoding of the speech stream, and the notes provide teachers with visual evidence that comprehension has occurred. In doing so, the learner has exercised multiple language skills in a complex, time-bound sequence. While taking notes occupies an increasingly large part of EFL instruction, this article encourages practitioners to consider the value of teaching, rather than only practising, EFL note-taking skills. I found myself asking how I could teach EFL note-taking skills rather than assume that learners had already acquired them. Thus, the motivation for this study was to investigate whether a step-by-step pedagogic cycle for taking notes could help learners. Following the instruction, the number of IUs increased, as did the number of learners opting for the outline format. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that learners found value in the focus on the various stages of note-taking.

To build on these findings, future research could incorporate an experimental design to determine whether the pedagogic note-taking cycle has any effect compared to a control group. This development in research design could determine differences between staged notetaking instruction and traditional approaches (i.e. merely providing practice opportunities). Specific tasks for learners to complete after their note-taking, such as quizzes, may be added to make the notes more consequential. In addition, the pedagogic cycle described here was used with the outline format and could be applied to other notetaking systems. Further, while this study involved intermediate learners, the pedagogic cycle should be examined and possibly adapted for use with other proficiency levels. More generally, whereas a majority of research has focused on lecture listening, the field

could expand to include taking notes in other situations (for example discussion classes or business meetings). While most educators agree that note-taking is a crucial skill, far fewer are as certain about how to address it through a scaffolded, developmental methodology in the EFL classroom.
