L2 academic writing

This study investigates the extent to which second language (L2) graduate students’ collocation use in academic writing improves with the independent use of a corpus tool, by analyzing the writing assignments of 115 Chinese EFL graduate students from an academic English course. The experimental group $\left( \mathrm { N } = 7 3 \right)$ received brief in-class training on the use of a corpus tool developed for collocation use (Linggle) and was required to use it for their two homework assignments, whereas the control group $\left( \mathrm { N } = 4 2 \right)$ ) was not made aware of the tool before their homework submission. The mean mutual information (MI) scores of the collocations used in the two writing assignments were compared between the experimental and control groups to evaluate the effect of independent corpus consultation (ICC). Overall, the results showed a marginally higher mean MI score for the experimental group, and the differences varied by collocation type. Survey results further revealed that fewer than $4 0 \%$ of the participants frequently used the tool, and the par ticipants reported difficulties in using the query syntax, understanding corpus results, and maintaining technical access to the tool. Our findings have useful pedagogical implications for considering independent corpus consultation as a supplementary tool for academic English instruction.

# 1. Introduction

Corpus consultation lies at the core of data-driven learning (DDL) (Cotos, Link, & Huffman, 2017), encouraging second language (L2) learners to explore large-scale authentic language data to identify various linguistic patterns, including collocation, grammatical, and generic move-and-step patterns (Cotos et al., 2017; Crosthwaite & Steeples, 2022). For L2 graduate students, corpus consultation holds significant potential to help them independently address linguistic challenges during the academic writing and revision process (Chang, 2014; Charles, 2014, 2018a; C. Yoon, 2016), enabling them to “reduce reliance on outside agencies, whether native-speakers, supervisors or proofreading services” (Charles, 2012, p. 94).

Existing studies on L2 graduate students’ corpus consultation in teacher-led, in-class settings indicate that they generally perceive guided corpus consultation favorably (e.g., H. Yoon & Hirvela, 2004), can successfully compile personal academic writing corpora with teacher guidance (e.g., Charles, 2012; Therova & McKay, 2023), and exhibit self-driven corpus consultation behaviors in corpus-integrated courses or programs (e.g., Crosthwaite et al., 2019). Building on these positive reactions, some researchers have further explored L2 graduate students’ independent corpus consultation (ICC), where reliance on teachers’ guidance is minimal. They found that L2 graduate students’ ICC generally helps to reduce lexical, lexico-grammatical, meta-linguistic, and register-related errors (e.g., Bridle, 2019; Dolgova & Mueller, 2019; Todd, 2001).

However, to date, little attention has been paid to L2 graduate students’ ICC for collocation use. Shifting the focus from general linguistic issues, such as word form and spelling (e.g., Alsehibany & Abdelhalim, 2023), to collocation use allows for a deeper un derstanding of how learners independently solve collocation problems using specialized corpus tools. This focus is crucial because appropriate collocation use is key to successful communication in academic writing (Gledhill, 2000), yet inappropriate use persists even among advanced L2 writers (Nesselhauf, 2003). Furthermore, increasingly user-friendly and intuitive corpus tools that require minimal training have been developed specifically to address collocation issues in recent years (e.g., Boisson et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2023; Frankenberg-Garcia et al., 2019).

Our study aims to build on ICC research in two key areas. First, while prior studies have mainly examined the effectiveness and perceptions of corpus consultation for collocation use in teacher-led, classroom-based settings (e.g., Chan & Liou, 2005; Nurmukhamedov, 2017; Reynolds, 2016), we investigate its effectiveness and learner perceptions during independent consultation outside the classroom following a brief in-class training session. This provides evidence of the feasibility of ICC for collocation use in graduate-level EAP writing courses, helping instructors determine how much control of corpus consultation to pass on to students. Second, we extend earlier research that focused on the frequency of L2 graduate students’ LCC for general linguistic purposes (Charles, 2012, 2014; Charles & Hadley, 2022), narrowing the scope to collocation use. This provides evidence on whether L2 graduate students frequently consult corpora to resolve collocation issues. The findings will offer valuable insights to researchers and educators who aim to promote corpus consultation as a tool for improving L2 learners’ collocation use. Ultimately, this study adds to the data-driven learning (DDL) literature by contributing pedagogically relevant insights into L2 graduate students’ ICC for collocation use in academic writing. Specifically, we seek to address the following two research questions:

(1) Does independent corpus consultation for collocation use affect the association strength of the collocations produced by L2 graduate students in their academic writing assignments? If so, to what extent?   
(2) What are L2 graduate students’ frequency and perceptions of independent corpus consultation for collocation use in their academic writing assignments?

# 2.1. Independent corpus consultation for L2 graduate students

Researchers have highlighted the importance of ICC in L2 academic contexts and have called for promoting L2 learners’ inde pendent use of corpora for personal language-related purposes (Templeton & Timmis, 2023). “Popularising” corpus use among L2 learners allows them to leverage vast amounts of authentic language data, a process that necessitates transferring the control of corpus consultation from experts in the classroom to learners in independent, out-of-class settings (Chambers, 2007, p. 3). For L2 graduate students, minimally controlled corpus use helps them address issues instantly and verify or extend their lexico-grammatical knowledge during the drafting and revision stages of academic writing (H. Yoon, 2008). It also helps them better align their writing with target genre conventions (Chang, 2014). Over time, ICC can foster L2 graduate students’ learner autonomy and facilitate their development as independent scholars and writers (Chang, 2014).

However, several challenges remain for L2 learners to fully exploit corpora autonomously after transitioning from teacher-led consultation (O’Sullivan, 2007). One such challenge is the linguistic expertise required to navigate corpora, which is believed to have been alleviated to some extent by the development of user-friendly corpus tools (Charles, 2018b) designed specifically for L2 learners. These tools offer “clearer and simpler” user interfaces (Chen et al., 2023, p. 641) and visually highlight language patterns in the query results (Liu & Gablasova, 2023), requiring “little or no instruction” on their use (Frankenberg-Garcia, 2020, p.29) and overcoming a common issue faced by L2 writers—overload from corpus data (e.g., Varley, 2009).

Other factors influencing successful independent corpus exploration include cognitive and metacognitive skills (O’Sullivan, 2007), vocabulary knowledge, overall language proficiency (Lee et al., 2019), corpus skills (Chung et al., 2024), and motivation to conduct language research with corpora (Kennedy & Miceli, 2001). L2 graduate students are particularly well-suited for ICC for several reasons. First, many have prior experience using corpora (Charles & Hadley, 2022) and demonstrate flexibility with corpus query patterns (Crosthwaite et al., 2019). Second, their cognitive and metacognitive skills in data analysis, a routine aspect of academic research, facilitate corpus use. Third, they tend to have a broader knowledge of collocations that is more “effortlessly available” than their less experienced counterparts (Frankenberg-Garcia, 2018, p. 93). Finally, since the production of English research writing is “more urgent” for L2 graduate students than L2 learners at lower academic levels (Belcher, 2012, p. 136), they are likely more motivated to consult corpora to resolve language issues in their writing. These characteristics help explain why ICC is considered “more appropriate for advanced-level adults” (Charles, 2022, p. 408) and why L2 graduate students have been the primary focus of ICC research.

Several studies have reported positive impacts of ICC on L2 graduate students’ error correction, although not all attempts were successful. For example, Todd (2001) found that L2 graduate students successfully corrected many single-word misuses after inducing the regularities of word usage from corpus results with minimal instructor guidance. Similarly, Bridle (2019) observed that L2 students enrolled in a preparatory course for graduate study achieved over $8 0 \%$ accuracy in error corrections with corpus consultation across three revised drafts. Conversely, Dolgova and Mueller (2019) found instances of inappropriate corrections of lexico-grammatical and register-related errors after corpus consultation.

Another group of empirical studies has focused on the frequency of ICC among L2 graduate students, indicating enthusiastic uptake outside of the classroom (Charles, 2012, 2014; Charles & Hadley, 2022). For instance, Charles (2012) found that over half $( 5 8 \% )$ of L2 graduate students enrolled in a corpus-integrated course used corpora at least once a week outside the classroom, while Charles (2014) reported that $7 0 \%$ of these students continued corpus consultation a year after the course.

Despite these positive findings, few studies have examined the effectiveness and frequency of L2 graduate students’ ICC specifically for collocation use. Insights into these issues can offer important implications for researchers developing collocation-targeted corpus tools and instructors looking to promote corpus consultation for resolving collocation-related issues. The following section will focus on corpus consultation for collocation use, particularly in the context of L2 graduate students’ academic writing.

# 2.2. Corpus consultation for collocation use

A number of user-friendly corpus tools that require minimal training have been developed to assist L2 learners in improving their English collocation use (Frankenberg-Garcia, 2020). Tools such as ColloCaid, embedded in text editors, provide real-time suggestions of collocations drawn from academic corpora, helping writers select more appropriate collocations to enhance idiomaticity (Frankenberg-Garcia et al., 2019). These tools also raise L2 writers’ awareness of unknown or forgotten collocations through prompted suggestions (Frankenberg-Garcia, 2020). Other corpus tools allow users to query collocation patterns via concordancer interfaces, filtering relevant collocations and organizing them in clear formats (e.g., Chen et al., 2023; Lai & Chang, 2020). These specialized corpus tools promote noticing and discovery of collocation patterns during corpus consultation.

Studies have generally reported positive effects of corpus consultation on L2 learners’ collocation use (e.g., Chan & Liou, 2005; Li, 2017; Nurmukhamedov, 2017; Reynolds, 2016). However, the focus has predominantly been on in-classroom corpus consultation with continuous scaffolding but rarely on the out-of-classroom context. Furthermore, existing studies commonly employed what Henriksen (2013, p. 43) referred to as “off-line elicitation” tasks along with guided corpus activities, such as gap-filling (e.g., Chan & Liou, 2005), error correction (e.g., Nurmukhamedov, 2017), and translation (e.g., Gao, 2011). These elicitation tasks appear less pertinent than authentic academic writing tasks for evaluating L2 graduate students’ collocation use in academic writing. For one thing, a key rationale for graduate-level writing courses is “writing for scholarly and professional publication” (Golding & Mascaro, 1985, p. 172), and academic writing performance tends to be more consequential for graduate students than for undergraduate students (Lavelle & Bushrow, 2007). For another, for L2 graduate students, corpus consultation is often employed for resolving immediate language problems rather than for language learning (C. Yoon, 2016). Therefore, authentic writing tasks would offer more relevant insights into the effectiveness of corpus tools in improving L2 graduate students’ collocation use in academic writing.

While assessing the appropriateness of collocation use in written texts, some studies employ a binary judgment approach (e.g., correct vs incorrect collocations) (e.g., Li, 2017), while others adopt a frequency-based approach. The former has raised concerns for ignoring collocations that fall between the two poles of correct and incorrect usage (H. J. Yoon, 2016) and for inconsistency in acceptability judgments across human raters (Nesselhauf, 2003). In contrast, the frequency-based approach treats collocation appropriateness as a continuum, measured through usage statistics such as frequency and association strength (e.g., Eguchi & Kyle, 2023; Garner, 2022; H. J. Yoon, 2016).

A common practice in the frequency-based approach involves extracting word pairs within a specified window size or with specific syntactic relations (e.g., the adverbial-modifier relation) and gauging their association strength using indices such as the mutual information (MI) score (e.g., Eguchi & Kyle, 2023; Evert, 2007). The MI score is often calculated as log2 (Observed frequency/Expected frequency), where observed frequency refers to the actual frequency of the target word pair in a reference corpus, and expected frequency represents the theoretical frequency of the pair if both words appeared randomly in the corpus (Evert, 2007). Collocations with negative MI scores indicate an undesirable deviation from typical language use (Evert, 2007), while those with higher positive MI scores suggest a greater degree of idiomaticity (Eguchi & Kyle, 2023). The MI score has been used as a proxy for phraseological competence demonstrated in written texts (H. J. Yoon, 2016), and it has been found to be positively correlated with vocabulary proficiency (Eguchi & Kyle, 2023), writing proficiency (e.g., Paquot, 2018, 2019), and overall language proficiency of L2 writers (e.g., Paquot et al., 2021). This correlation can be attributed to the MI score’s representation of “semantic specialization” (Paquot, 2019, p. 126) and the rarity of “exclusivity” of co-occurring words (Gablasova et al., 2017, p. 164). To date, studies that analyze collocation use through the frequency-based approach in the context of L2 graduate students’ ICC remain rare.

In addition to examining the effectiveness of corpus consultation on collocation use, studies have also investigated factors such as perceived usefulness and difficulties related to corpus consultation in teacher-led classroom contexts. Findings suggest that L2 learners believe corpus consultation improves collocation use and overall English writing (Chan & Liou, 2005; Liu & Gablasova, 2023; Reynolds, 2016) and appreciate corpus tools for their easy navigation (Nurmukhamedov, 2017). However, challenges have also been reported, including unfamiliarity with the parts of speech and meanings of the words in the corpus results (Nurmukhamedov, 2017), confusion regarding query input (Reynolds, 2016), the time-consuming nature of searching (Chan & Liou, 2005), and technical problems when using corpus tools on personal computers (Liu & Gablasova, 2023). Despite these insights, it remains unclear how L2 learners perceive the usefulness and challenges of corpus consultation in the absence of continuous teacher guidance. Investigating the effectiveness of ICC on L2 graduate students’ collocation use and exploring their frequency and perceptions of ICC for collocation use can contribute to a deeper understanding of L2 learners’ late-stage corpus consultation, particularly in relation to the important linguistic aspect of collocation.

The present study evaluates the effect of using a specialized corpus tool on L2 graduate students’ collocation use in academic writing, building on studies that measure collocation appropriateness using the frequency-based approach. We compared the mean MI scores of the collocations used by two groups of L2 graduate students in two academic writing assignments, one assigned ICC after receiving training and the other not assigned ICC. To further explore factors that may influence the effectiveness of ICC, we also examined students’ reported frequency of corpus tool use, their perceived usefulness, difficulties, and strategies for utilizing the corpus tool in their L2 academic writing.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Participants

A total of 115 doctoral students (L1 Chinese) from an academic English course at a large public university in mainland China gave informed consent to participate in this study. The participants included 33 females and 82 males, ranging in age from 21 to 45 years $( M e a n = 2 4$ , $S D = 3$ ). Their average score on the College English Test Band-4 (CET-4) was 549 $\boldsymbol { S D } = 5 3$ , out of a maximum possible score of 710.1 The majority of the participants $( 9 7 \% )$ were first-year doctoral students, and only three were in their second, third, or fourth year. They represented a variety of disciplines, with $8 5 \%$ coming from the hard sciences.2

At the time of the study, all participants were enrolled in a compulsory academic English course during the spring term of 2020, designed for non-English major doctoral students. According to university policy, students could be exempted from the course if they demonstrated language proficiency equivalent to the course level, such as by achieving a high score on an internationally recognized language proficiency test. The participants were drawn from four classes, two of which were assigned to the experimental group, and the other two to the control group. The demographic characteristics of the two groups were generally well-balanced, with the exception of the average number of academic conferences participants had attended prior to the study, as shown in Table 1.

# 3.2. Corpus tool for collocation use: Linggle

The corpus tool adopted in the present study was a web-based collocation tool, Linggle (https://search.linggle.com), developed by Boisson et al. (2013).3 This tool was chosen for three main reasons. First, it is considered user-friendly, offering free access without requiring user registration, making it “fast and convenient” for corpus consultation (Lai & Chang, 2020, p. 275). Second, it allows users to specify the part of speech (POS) of the collocates in their queries, saving users time and effort in determining the correct parts of speech of the collocates in the search results, a step often required in other corpus tools such as SKELL (Lai & Chang, 2020) (see Fig. 1 for examples of Linggle queries used in tool demonstration and training). Third, Linggle’s large corpus enables users to query a wide range of English collocations using various search patterns. It retrieves candidate collocations (or longer word combinations) from the Google Web 1T n-grams, a 1-trillion-token dataset composed of n-grams ranging from one to five words. In addition, search results include example sentences extracted from the New York Times Corpus (Chang, 2013). The collocations returned are ranked by fre quency, allowing users to quickly compare the frequency counts of candidate collocations (see Fig. 2 for sample corpus results). Collapsed example sentences can be expanded with a click, and they are presented as anchor texts linked to their original web sources.

# 3.3. Frequency and perceptions of ICC: A questionnaire

Questionnaire in Chinese was administered to collect data on the frequency of use and their perceptions of the corpus tool. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: the first gathered background information as described in Section 3.1, and the second focused on the participants’ frequency and perceptions of the tool use for collocation. Frequency of use was assessed through a multiple-choice question with options ranging from “seldom,” “sometimes,” “often,” to “almost always.” For perceptions of ICC, we adapted ques tionnaire items from H. Yoon and Hirvela (2004) on the perceived usefulness and difficulties of corpus consultation, adding two items on participants’ tendency to follow frequency rankings and example usage of collocations in the corpus results. Responses were collected using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” The questionnaire was administered digitally via an online platform (https://www.wjx.cn), and the frequency question was programmed to appear only for those who reported using the tool in at least one writing assignment (see the Results section for the questionnaire items).

# 3.4. Data collection procedure

Students from four classes, all taught by the same professor, learned how to write the introduction section of a research article based on its typical generic moves during week 7 of a 16-week course. At the end of the lesson, an approximately 5-min in-class training module on using the corpus tool for collocation use was conducted for two classes (i.e., the experimental group). The training consisted of a presentation introducing the tool, demonstrating how to access it, explaining the query syntax, and illustrating result interpre tation. This training was considered an appropriate guide for the participants’ subsequent ICC, as 67 out of the 73 participants $( 9 2 \% )$ in the experimental group agreed or strongly agreed in the questionnaire that the training had helped improve their tool-use skills. After the training, students were asked to complete a homework assignment that involved writing the introduction section of a research article in their own discipline. They were also required to use the corpus tool during their writing, although the instructions did not explicitly mention any penalty for non-use. The other two classes (i.e., the control group) were taught how to write the introduction section in the same way and given the same assignment, but they were not informed about the corpus tool until the study concluded. Both the experimental and control groups were given two weeks to complete the first writing assignment and submit it via the course website by week 9 (see Fig. 3 for the timeline). Once their first drafts were submitted, feedback was provided by course as sistants, who were unaware of the research, and the course professor. This feedback process lasted an additional two weeks. From weeks 11–13, students were asked to revise their drafts and resubmit them as the second writing assignment. As in Bridle (2019), students could use any resources (e.g., their own knowledge, feedback, and corpus tools) during the revision process. However, only the experimental group was required to use the corpus tool for collocation use during both the initial writing and the revision.

After the submission of the second writing assignment, the online questionnaire was distributed to all willing participants. The questionnaire gathered information about whether students used the tool, considering the possibility of crossover between the experimental and control groups outside of class. For example, some students in the experiment group might not have used the tool, while some in the control group may have learned about it through discussions with their peers in the experimental group and used it during their assignments. The reported use and non-use, along with the treatment assignment (i.e., experimental or control group), were used for statistical analysis, as will be discussed in Section 3.6. Altogether, we collected 115 questionnaires and 230 written texts (hereafter referred to as “the learner corpus”) from the participants.

# 3.5. Collocation measurement

To measure the association strength of collocations in the learner corpus, we first selected a reference corpus for calculating MI scores, following the procedures outlined by Paquot (2018, 2019) and Eguchi and Kyle (2023). A reference corpus is “a large, general corpus of the target language” (Gablasova et al., 2017, p. 171), and differences in collocation use between an appropriate reference corpus and L2 learners’ texts often signal deviations from conventional language use. Although previous studies have frequently used the Corpus of Contemporary American English (e.g., Eguchi & Kyle, 2023) or the British National Corpus (e.g., Durrant & Schmitt, 2009) as the reference corpus, we selected the Elsevier OA CC-BY4 corpus (Kershaw & Koeling, 2020) for two key reasons. First, the genre of texts in this corpus (i.e., research articles) aligns with the genre of the learner corpus in the present study, making the two corpora more comparable. Second, this Elsevier corpus is both large and discipline-balanced, with 40,001 research articles evenly extracted from 27 disciplines (Kershaw & Koeling, 2020), making it an ideal source for representing collocation use in research articles from diverse fields of study. We removed abstracts, author highlights, bibliographies, and meta-information from the reference corpus to focus solely on the main body of the research articles.

Next, for the learner corpus, we manually removed meta-information, in-text citations, and obvious spelling errors to ensure consistency between the two corpora. This was followed by a preprocessing procedure for both corpora, which included format conversion, expanding contractions, identifying and skipping non-natural language, adding spaces where needed, merging hyphen ated words, and lowercasing all tokens to improve the accuracy of collocation extraction in subsequent analyses (see Table 2 for examples).

After the corpus cleaning procedures, tokenization, POS tagging, dependency relation parsing, and collocation extraction were subsequently carried out (see Table 3 for the pipeline). Collocations forming three types of dependency relations, namely, adjectival modifier (adjmod), adverbial modifier (advmod), and direct object (dobj), were extracted from the reference corpus using the spaCy package (Honnibal & Montani, 2017). These dependency relations were chosen due to their frequent use in studies investigating L2 phraseological competence (Paquot, 2018, 2019) or profiling L2 collocation use (Eguchi & Kyle, 2023). At this stage, a total of 187, 489,074 tokens were automatically generated after excluding tokens with the following POS tags: “x” (i.e., unknown token), space, symbol, and punctuation. Ultimately, 6,612,072 collocations were extracted from the reference corpus.

For each collocation extracted from the reference corpus, an MI score was calculated and assigned to the corresponding collocation in the learner corpus. However, MI scores could not be calculated for collocations that occurred exclusively in the learner corpus, as they lacked frequency information in the reference corpus. A manual review of the extracted collocations was performed to remove those collocations containing tokens tagged as “NUM” (e.g., “10.4”) or “X” (e.g., “i.e.”), non-English words (e.g., “гантиМров”), or incorrectly tagged words (e.g., “boundary” incorrectly tagged as “adj”). After this refinement, a total of 18,345 collocations in the dobj, advmod, and amod relations from the learner corpus were assigned MI scores (see Table 4 for the three types of collocations). No threshold was set for MI scores or observed frequency to allow for a more granular analysis of collocation use by the L2 graduate students.

# 3.6. Data analysis

RQ1 investigates the extent to which ICC affects the mean MI score of the collocations produced by L2 graduate students. To account for some participants’ non-compliance with the treatment assignment, instrumental variable estimation was employed to provide a more accurate assessment of the treatment effects (Huang, 2018). A practical example of this approach in education research involves identifying students who did not comply with the treatment assignment, such as failing to submit their homework, and then using the treatment assignment as an instrumental variable to estimate the effect of homework completion on exam scores (Grodner & Rupp, 2013). In this study, similar non-compliance with the treatment assignment (i.e., training in corpus consultation and the requirement to use the tool for writing assignments) was observed in the questionnaire data. Specifically, one participant who was assigned the treatment reported never using the corpus tool for either writing assignment, while 18 participants in the control group reported using the tool. Consequently, we treated the original treatment assignment as the instrumental variable for the actual use of the corpus tool, allowing for a more accurate analysis of its effect on the association strength of collocations. We conducted both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions and Instrumental Variable (IV) estimations, utilizing R Statistical Software (v4.2.3; R Core Team, 2023) and the ivreg package (v0.6-2; Fox et al., 2023). To answer RQ2, we present percentages of participants’ reported frequency of tool use, as well as their responses to 25 questionnaire items regarding their perceptions of their tool use.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Effectiveness of L2 graduate students’ independent corpus consultation

The OLS regressions served as benchmark specifications to assess the effect of treatment assignment on collocation use. The estimated coefficients for Required_ICC (i.e., whether participants were assigned to the experimental or control group) revealed that participants assigned with the treatment outperformed those not assigned, with differences of 0.1 points for direct-object collocations, 0.3 points for adverbial-modifier collocations, and 0.1 points for adjectival-modifier collocations, after controlling for gender (Fe male0), age (Age), CET-4 score (CET-4), and the length of their first draft (Txt_length) (see Table 5). Among these, only the effect on adverbial-modifier collocations reached statistical significance. The OLS regression results indicated that training in corpus consul tation and requiring students to use the corpus led to modest improvements in collocation use. However, it is important to note that treatment assignment primarily motivated students to use the corpus tool, rather than directly causing significant changes in collocation use in their academic writing and revisions.

To further understand the impact of participants’ actual engagement with ICC on their collocation use, we conducted IV estimations with two-stage least squared regressions. The estimated results for Reported_ICC (i.e., self-reported tool use based on the questionnaire) across all three collocation types showed that students who reported using the tool for at least one writing assignment had mean MI scores that were 0.1–0.4 points higher than those who reported not using the tool, in models without control variables (see Table 6). The effect for reported corpus consultation was unsurprisingly larger than that indicated by the OLS results, which showed a 0.1 to 0.2 point increase in mean MI scores for assigned treatment without control variables. Treatment assignment does not always align with actual compliance, and ignoring this difference can bias the estimated treatment effect. Notably, the IV estimates showed that the higher mean MI scores were statistically significant only for adverbial-modifier collocations, regardless of the inclusion of control variables. For the other two dependency types, the differences between users and non-users were not statistically significant. Overall, these results suggest marginally higher average association strength of the collocations produced by students who reported using the tool during their academic writing assignments.

To illustrate this advantage, two pairs of example advmod collocations (1a–1b; 2a–2b) were extracted from the writing assignments of students who reported using Linggle (Con) and those who reported not using the tool (No_Con). In both sets (1a–1b and 2a–2b), the collocations used by the corpus consultation group show higher co-occurrence frequency, as indicated by Linggle. The use of such collocations helped increase the mean MI score of the collocations.

1a. The research on the magnetic properties of the quartz flexible accelerometer is basically based on the combination of physical test and simulation (No_Con). 1b. On the other hand, study of sequential hypothesis testing with FC are mainly based on SPRT proposed by Wald (Con). 2a. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively study the error influence of the quartz flexible accelerometer from the aspects of thermal field, magnetic field and pendulum deformation, which has practical engineering significance for improving the working stability and working degree of the quartz flexible accelerometer (No_Con). 2b. In addition, it is worth noting that [Russia] А. В. СолоМин “Князья гантиМров” comprehensively analyzes and introduces a series of problems such as the origin of Ghentmur’s family, the status of his family and the situation of his descendants (Con).

# 4.2. Frequency and perceptions of independent corpus consultatio

The questionnaire survey results revealed a high take-up of the corpus tool, with 72 out of 73 participants $( 9 9 \% )$ in the experi mental group reporting using Linggle for at least one writing assignment. However, among the 90 participants from both the experimental and control groups who reported using the tool, only 35 (or $3 9 \%$ ) used it “almost always” or “often”. Among the remaining participants, 48 (or $5 3 \%$ ) used it “sometimes,” and 7 (or $8 \%$ ) “seldom” used it, as shown in Fig. 4. The results suggest that while most participants initiated ICC during their academic writing and revision tasks, their use of the tool was not consistently frequent.

The questionnaire survey results also reflected a largely positive attitude toward the usefulness of ICC among the 90 tool users (see Table 7). At least $9 0 \%$ of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with 12 of the 15 positive statements regarding their experience using the tool. The three items with the highest agreement were the perceived helpfulness of Linggle in academic writing $( 9 9 \% )$ , their fondness for using the tool $( 9 8 \% )$ , and their trust in the accuracy of the vocabulary usage demonstrated by Linggle $( 9 7 \% )$ .

Meanwhile, an average of $4 0 \%$ of respondents either agreed with or were unsure about the challenges associated with ICC. Spe cifically, $2 4 \%$ reported difficulty with searching techniques, and $1 8 \%$ noted technical issues such as internet connectivity, browser compatibility, insufficient example sentences in corpus results, unfamiliar vocabulary in examples, and incomprehensible example sentences. Regarding their strategies for utilizing corpus results, respondents showed a strong tendency $( 9 4 \% )$ to follow the usage of vocabulary in example sentences and the rank order of co-occurrence frequency provided by Linggle.

# 5. Discussion

The overall marginal effect of ICC on the association strength of collocations observed in the present study appears to be weaker than the improvement reported in studies on L2 learners’ collocation task performance in teacher-led contexts, where continuous guidance is provided (Chan & Liou, 2005; Li, 2017; Nurmukhamedov, 2017; Reynolds, 2016). Several factors could explain this seemingly weaker effect. First, there is the difference in task difficulty. The written tasks used in this study to assess collocations for L2 graduate students are generally more demanding than the offline elicitation tasks used in most previous studies, as they involve multiple cognitive processes (Ong, 2014). The challenge is heightened when collocations must be used in highly specialized scholarly writing, where adherence to conventionalized collocations within specific research domains also needs to be considered during writing and revision (Green & Lambert, 2018). Given the complexity of these tasks, even a small improvement in phraseological competence supports the plausibility of transferring the control of corpus consultation to L2 learners at later stages of DDL, as advocated by Chambers (2007).

Another explanation for the modest effect could be the difficulties L2 graduate students encountered with corpus consultation during academic writing and revisions, which may have discouraged them from regularly seeking help from the corpus tool. The questionnaire results on perceived difficulties suggest that L2 graduate students may still need support with query syntax and vo cabulary knowledge to enhance their corpus consultation skills and improve their ability to interpret results. For tool developers, optimizing the interface to make it more accessible and minimize the linguistic knowledge required for searches may also help L2 graduate students benefit more from ICC in their academic writing.

The high proportion of participants in the experimental group who used the tool for their writing assignments is consistent with the high uptake of corpus consultation in corpus-integrated classrooms reported by Charles & Hadley, 2022. However, this initiation does not necessarily ensure sustained use, as $6 1 \%$ of all tool users, including those from the control group, used the tool less than often for their academic writing assignments. This percentage of low use is close to the $6 2 \%$ of respondents who used corpus tools less than once a week in Charles, (2014) . According to Charles (2012), the low frequency of use does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest. Rather, academic writing unfolds in stages, and students’ frequency of use of corpus tools may vary across different stages (Charles, 2014). This may have been the case in the present study. As the course encouraged academic writing with the ultimate of publication, some students may not have needed to use the corpus tool intensively at the time of the study but may postpone their corpus consultation until later revision stages.

Participants’ generally positive attitudes toward ICC are consistent with the favorable perceptions of corpus consultation reported by L2 students in classroom settings (e.g., Charles, 2012; H. Yoon & Hirvela, 2004). However, some difficulties were also acknowl edged, and the most and least difficult aspects reported by our participants differed from those reported by respondents in classroom contexts (H. Yoon & Hirvela, 2004). Specifically, compared to the results reported by H. Yoon and Hirvela (2004), the use of query syntax was a bigger challenge for our participants, while the time and energy involved in data analysis were less of a concern. This difference suggests that, when independently using the corpus tool, L2 graduate students may struggle more with search techniques such as using wildcards, regular expressions, and POS tags. The less time and energy needed for corpus result analysis, on the other hand, may be attributed to the simple and clear formatting of Linggle’s corpus results. Two additional challenges were notable: technical issues related to using the tool via a computer or internet, and difficulties understanding vocabulary and sentences in corpus results. These findings indicate that even L2 graduate students, who are generally high-intermediate to advanced language users with some corpus consultation experience, may still face technical issues and linguistic obstables during ICC.

# 6. Conclusion

Drawing on 115 Chinese EFL graduate students’ academic writing assignments and their questionnaire responses, this study explored the effect of ICC on the association strength of collocations in L2 graduate students’ academic writing assignments, as well as their frequency and perceptions of ICC. The findings show that, while the majority of participants initiated ICC after receiving training and being required to use the tool, fewer than half reported frequent use during writing and revision. Although the majority of in dependent tool users expressed generally positive attitudes toward ICC, especially regarding its helpfulness in academic writing, several difficulties were identified. These challenges included problems with query syntax, technical issues in accessing the corpus tool, and difficulties understanding vocabulary and sentences in corpus results. The study also found that ICC had a small effect on the association strength of the collocations in L2 graduates’ academic writing, and the effect varied among different types of dependency relations, with adverbial-modifier collocations showing more significantly improvements than direct-object and adjectival-modifier collocations.

The results of the current study provide evidence for the feasibility of incorporating and promoting ICC outside of the classroom among L2 graduate students. However, additional guidance on query syntax, vocabulary knowledge, and sentence comprehension is needed to help L2 graduate students fully benefit from ICC. Additionally, the study highlights the potential for tool developers to improve corpus tools by making them more user-friendly, requiring less linguistic knowledge, and providing more example sentences.

Several limitations of this study should be considered for future research. First, the results of the present study should be gener alized with caution, as the participants were from a top university in China, and results may differ in other contexts. Second, future studies could complement the current self-report method with log analysis of tool use, as proposed by P´erez-Paredes et al., (2011), which could provide more detailed data on how learners engage with corpus tools. Finally, the effectiveness of ICC might vary across different corpus tools, and future research could explore the use of other tools, such as text editor-embedded corpus tools for collo cation use (e.g., Frankenberg-Garcia et al., 2019), to gain deeper insights into the potential of ICC for improving L2 academic writing.
