# Abstract

Our study explores the similarities and differences between a discourse completion task (DCT) and corpus data and discusses potential implications for using the two in a pedagogic context. The DCT has traditionally been used an instrument for the study of interlanguage pragmatics while both spoken and written corpora have mainly been used to facilitate language description. Corpora also have a place in the language-teaching context as they can provide the learner with patterns of language use in social interactions some of which are not open to intuition. By contrasting native speakers’ expressions of gratitude elicited by a DCT with those found in a five million word corpus of spoken English, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of both data sets with regard to the language-teaching context. The results suggest that a combined use of both instruments might aid the teaching of formulaic sequences in the classroom.

# 1. Background

Over the past two decades there have been a number of studies which have highlighted the considerable inconsistencies between the English that we find in textbooks and that which is recorded in multi-million word corpora of spoken and written English (McCarthy and Carter, 1995; Williams, 1988). While the former is often based on one author’s intuition the latter includes a range of spoken and written discourse produced by a wide range of authors. It has therefore been argued that a corpus might be a better basis from which we can derive language-teaching materials than the judgments made about a language by a single author. In addition the corpus provides us with information which is not easily accessible by intuition, such as frequency information (see for example Sinclair, 1991).

However, since the aim of a corpus as a linguistic research resource is to capture language used by as wide a range of speakers as possible (e.g., members of different age groups, educational and social backgrounds) and in a wide variety of different contexts and social relationships, corpus data may at times not be able to reflect fully all of the different ways in which a specific speech act is executed by parts of the native speaker population in a closely defined context.

Thus, while the aim of corpus research is to provide evidence of patterns in the language use of a population, the aim of discourse completion task (DCT) research is to investigate a linguistic act within highly predefined parameters. One area that has so far been relatively under-explored is the comparison between data that has been elicited via a DCT and that found in a corpus. This is maybe not surprising since the DCT has not traditionally been used to inform teaching materials. The arguments surrounding the use of intuition versus naturally occurring data still hold for this instrument; however, the use of a DCT allows researchers to examine what speakers would say in specific contexts that are controlled for a variety of factors, such as relationship to other interlocutors or the imposition on the interlocutor for which the gratitude is expressed. In addition, the completion of the DCT by multiple participants means that it reflects the intuition of more than one author. As such it would seem to share some of the properties of the native-speaker intuition approach to designing language-teaching materials, and indeed to language description, and some of the properties of a corpus-based approach.

Of course, eliciting language data from a number of native speakers is not a new methodology but so far there has been little attempt to compare such responses with a corpus of spoken English. Our study sets out to compare the responses of a DCT to the distribution and realization of the same responses in a corpus of spoken English. DCTs have traditionally been used to assess the participants’ performance of a particular speech act function such as issuing a request for example (e.g., House and Kasper, 1987; Blum-Kulka et al., 1989; Barron, 2003).

One of the discourse functions that learners are likely to encounter in a variety of situations are expressions of gratitude (Coulmas, 1981). It seems therefore only prudent that learners should be equipped with the lexical means necessary to communicate effectively in situations where conventionalized phrases facilitate them both in their roles as speakers and listeners (Nattinger and DeCarrico, 1992; Lewis, 1993). Expressions of gratitude often occur as functional lexical chunks such as thank you and we will focus in this paper in particular on the comparison of the use of such units in the corpus and the DCT. The aim of our paper is to examine: (a) to what degree both instruments yield similar results with regard to formulaic sequences used by native speakers and (b) how variations in the findings of both data sets can provide justifications for using both instruments in conjunction to inform teaching materials.

# 2. Multi-word units, discourse functions and language learning

Ellis (1997, p. 129) argues that ‘‘speaking natively is speaking idiomatically using frequent and familiar collocations, and the job of the language learner is to learn these familiar word sequences.’’ Recent research has illustrated that learners’ incorrect use of multiword expressions that entail particular socio-interactional purposes (Wray, 2000, 2002) can cause disruption in their conversations with native speakers (Swan, 1997). As Schmitt and Carter (2004) point out, the appropriate use of formulaic sequences is important since ‘‘interlocutors expect them, and they are the preferred choice. Thus, formulaic sequences are not only useful for efficient language usage; they are essential for appropriate language use.’’(p. 10). Automatizing linguistic performance by learning and employing formulaic sequences has a number of advantages. Gatbonton and Segalowitz (1988) suggest that using routinized utterances frees up attentional resources of the learners so that these can be allocated to where they are most needed. In addition, the use of formulaic sequences in conversations with native speakers2 can make the learner appear more fluent and therefore lead to more input of the target language as ‘‘listeners are more likely to continue interactions with someone whose speech is relatively smooth than with someone who falters or hesitates’’ (Gatbonton and Segalowitz, 1988, p. 475).

In their seminal paper, Pawley and Syder (1983) argue that the fluent and idiomatic speech of native speakers is based on several hundred thousand lexicalized sentence stems. These stems are quickly retrieved and processed, thereby enabling the speakers to focus their attention on other important interactional issues, a point that is also stressed by Gatbonton and Segalowitz (1988). The high number of different terms that are being used by researchers for what we will call formulaic sequences in this paper are also an indication for the multitude of linguistic traditions that have addressed such sequences (see Nattinger and DeCarrico, 1992; Moon, 1997 for an overview of the different subcategories of sequences).

Words used to express gratitude have been classified as social interactional markers ‘‘carrying functional meaning relating to conversational purpose’’ (Nattinger and DeCarrico, 1992, p. 60). Making the right lexical decisions involving this particular type of formulaic sequences is therefore closely linked with possessing the pragmatic ability to select the appropriate words. As Ooi and Kim-Seoh (1996) and Melka (1997) emphasize, merely knowing the meaning or a definition of a word is not enough; a key component of learners’ lexical competence is also the appropriateness of the lexical choice.

It is therefore hardly surprising that studies focusing on expressions of gratitude have predominantly been pragmatic in nature (Aijmer, 1996; Bodman and Eisenstein, 1988; Coulmas, 1981; Eisenstein and Bodman, 1986, 1993; Hinkel, 1994; House, 1979; Kasper, 1981; Kotani, 2002; Nakai and Watanabe, 2000; Okamoto and Robinson, 1997). Some of these bear particular relevance to our study. Eisenstein and Bodman (1986) found that their ‘‘native speaker participants were remarkably consistent in their choice of language – almost as if there was a finite number of options from which one selected – in other words, a shared manuscript’’ (1986, p. 172), which supports Nattinger and DeCarrico’s (1992) and Wray’s (2000) classification of expressions of gratitude as socio-interactional formulaic sequences.

Bodman and Eisenstein’s (1988) and Eisenstein and Bodman’s (1993) investigations further show that even advanced learners are often unable to produce correct idioms and routines and this applies also to those expressions that are consistently automatized in native speaker English. One reason why language learners displayed these difficulties in choosing formulaic replies when expressing their gratitude might be that thanking and responding to being thanked are reactive speech acts (Coulmas, 1981). This means that compared to requests, suggestions or compliments, the speaker does not have time to plan the utterance in advance, but is instead forced to react quickly to the action or utterance that prompts the necessity for an expression of gratitude.

# 3. Formulaic sequences expressing gratitude and teaching materials

Since expressions of gratitude are reactive linguistic actions as discussed above, it does seem appropriate that teaching materials should equip language learners with a repertoire of formulaic sequences and expressions of gratitude that allows learners to convey their thanks in an appropriate manner even at a relatively early learning stage. Our investigation of expressions of gratitude in four randomly selected textbooks for beginner and intermediate learners, however, showed that coursebooks seem to differ considerably in that regard. The beginner level coursebook by Soars and Soars (2000) contained the single expression thanks, the simple formulaic sequence thank you, two varieties of thank you $^ +$ adverbial and thank you $^ +$ acceptance of compliment. Cunningham et al.’s (2002) beginner level coursebook included thanks, thanks/thank you $^ +$ adverbial and two instances of thanks $^ +$ reciprocating good wishes. Thus, the two textbooks provide learners with some basic expressions and formulaic sequences, but fall short of introducing the preposition ‘for’ that would be needed to add the construction explaining the reason for the expression of gratitude.

Kay et al.’s (2000) intermediate coursebook contains formulaic sequences stating the reason for the speaker’s thanking and even gives the learners two options for it (i.e., thanks you for verb $^ +$ ing/possessive pronoun $^ +$ noun). Unfortunately, additional expressions of gratitude or formulaic sequences are rather limited in their variety, since the book only includes thanks $^ +$ name, thank you and thank you $^ +$ adverbials. A much broader variety of formulaic sequences expressing gratitude can be found in Cunningham and Moor’s (2005) intermediate level textbook. Their coursebook contains the single expression thanks, the simple formulaic sequence thanks/thank you $^ +$ adverbial as well as the more specific categories thanking $^ +$ complimenting interlocutor, thanking $^ +$ stating intent to reciprocate and thanking $^ +$ stating reason.

The formulaic sequences and single expressions employed to express gratitude in the four textbooks has shown that the number of sequences included in the coursebooks differs and that the beginner level books did not contain the rather important formulaic sequence of thanking $^ +$ stating reason. While Cunningham and Moor’s very recently published intermediate level coursebook provides learners with some good formulaic sequences, Kay et al.’s (2000) intermediate textbook merely adds thanking $^ +$ stating reason to the basic thanking formulae. Thus, it seems that learners will probably acquire the basic formulaic sequence of thanks/thank you $^ +$ adverbial and thanks $^ +$ stating reasons in the early stages of their language learning career. Whether they will be presented additional options seems to be very much at the discretion of the textbooks’ authors and their teachers. It is also interesting to note that none of the four coursebooks contained the single expressions cheers or ta as casual synonyms for thanks. Our investigation will show whether corpus and DCT data can provide learners with a wider variety of formulaic sequences of expressions of gratitude than the teaching material investigated.

# 4. The discourse completion task and corpus data

The discourse completion task was first used to examine pragmatic speech act realizations by Blum-Kulka (1982). Since then it has become one of the most frequently used data elicitation instruments in interlanguage pragmatic research (Kasper, 1998; BardoviHarlig, 1999; Kasper and Rose, 2002). Although they are one of the most popular instruments in interlanguage pragmatics, DCTs have also been criticized for not providing the same variety of linguistic elements, such as repetitions, inversions and omissions that can be observed in naturally occurring data (Yuan, 2001). In addition, studies comparing naturally occurring compliments (Golato, 2003) and rejections (Hartford and Bardovi-Harlig, 1992) with DCT data, have shown that the utterance length and the participants’ preference for certain strategies can vary. Researchers investigating the strategies and lexical items gathered by DCTs and other data collection methods found, however, that the same words and expressions were used in written DCTs, role-plays and naturally occurring data (Bodman and Eisenstein, 1988; Eisenstein and Bodman, 1993; Sasaki, 1998).

The corpus data in the aforementioned studies that were based on naturally occurring speech is limited in size and contextual variation compared to the CANCODE corpus that we are using for this study. Golato’s (2003) study is based on $2 5 \mathrm { h }$ face to face conversations $+ 6 \mathrm { h }$ telephone conversations while Bardovi-Harlig and Hartford (1993) study 39 advising sessions. Yuan’s (2001) study is unspecific about the exact size of the corpus. The access to multi-million word corpora of naturally occurring spoken English allows for a large scale study of expressions of gratitude that may highlight patterns of usage.

# 5. Methodology

# 5.1. Data collection

For the purpose of this study, we carried out a discourse completion task of eight scenarios with 16 native speakers. As discussed above the scenarios focus on expressions of gratitude. The design of the DCT used in this study is based on the discourse completion tasks developed in the area of cross-cultural pragmatic studies (e.g., House and Kasper, 1987; Blum-Kulka et al., 1989). We used the data collected via the DCT as a basis for a corpus analysis. This means that we ran concordance searches of individual expressions of gratitude and responders used by the participants in a corpus of spoken English. Since the aim of our study was to compare DCT and corpus data for the purpose of a possible combined application of the data sets in the classroom, we chose the DCT as our starting point and carried out a subsequent corpus search. This meant that we were unable to control the context of the scenarios in the corpus.

This approach was taken deliberately, as we wanted to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the two data sets. For our investigation we were particularly interested in the expressions of gratitude made by a broad sample of British English native speakers as well as in the expressions of gratitude formulated by a very specific group of native speakers. The corpus data would provide detailed insights into expressions of gratitude employed by a wide part of the population in casual conversations between friends and family, while the DCT scenarios were designed to represent situations that a specific group (in this case university students) were likely to come across during a sojourn in the target environment. Similar to the corpus data, the DCT contains primarily interactions in informal, everyday contexts, although one scenario also explores a formal student-lecturer interaction (A3 ‘lecturer’).

The corpus used for our study is the Cambridge and Nottingham Corpus of Discourse in English (CANCODE), a five million word database that was collected between 1994 and 2001. CANCODE is a collaborative project between the University of Nottingham and Cambridge University Press with whom sole copyright resides. The corpus data represent a wide socio-economic and demographic spread of British English usage and are thus a valuable resource for the teaching of general spoken English (see McCarthy, 1998 for a description of this corpus).

The DCT contained eight scenarios designed to elicit expressions of gratitude (items A1–A8). Four of the scenarios (A1 ‘bus’, A5 ‘birthday’, A6 ‘salt’, B7 ‘face’) were items used in Eisenstein and Bodman’s (1986) questionnaire and were slightly altered so that the students could identify with them better (e.g., a ‘blue sweater’ becomes a more neutral and less expensive ‘nicely wrapped present’ in scenario A5). The other scenarios were based on situations that one of us either experienced herself or observed as a student and thus follow Bardovi-Harlig’s (1999) call for the contextual relevance of DCT scenarios. Consequently, interactants in the eight situations are friends/flatmates, strangers and lecturers.

# 5.2. Participants in the DCT investigation

The 16 British English native speakers who completed the discourse completion task were students enrolled at the University of Nottingham. While the number of participants in other DCT studies vary, the accepted cut-off point for statistical analysis is 15 and we used this as a guideline for our sample design (Field, 2000). Six of the participants were male and 10 female. They had been brought up in various different parts of England, such as Buckinghamshire, Lincolnshire and the West Midlands. Their average age was 21 years. The participants completed the eight scenarios and answered additional personal questions in less than $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ in the presence of one of the authors.

# 6. Analysis of expressions of gratitude

# 6.1. Turns consisting of single lexical items or basic formulaic sequences

Table 1 shows the frequency of single lexical items and basic formulaic sequences that were employed by the participants in this study to express gratitude. It also shows the frequencies of the same items in the CANCODE corpus. Note that these figures only reflect lexical items and sequences that are used to make up a complete turn based on the results in the DCT data. The figures in brackets represent the overall frequency of the individual items in the CANCODE corpus.

Since the main focus of our paper is on formulaic sequences in expressions of gratitude, our discussion here will centre mainly on the stem ‘thank’ and cheers. The two most frequently used expressions to convey gratitude in the DCT are those containing the aforementioned stem ‘thank’. This is not surprising since constructions around this particular stem are traditionally referred to in teaching materials on the expression of gratitude.

Table 1 Frequency of lexical items and basic formulaic sequences expressing gratitude   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Expression of gratitude</td><td>DCT</td><td>CANCODE</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks</td><td>20</td><td>136 (of 1239)</td></tr><tr><td>Cheers</td><td>14</td><td>212 (of 338)</td></tr><tr><td>Ta</td><td>2</td><td>24 (of 166)</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you</td><td>16</td><td>440 (of 2021)</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks a lot</td><td>3</td><td>47 (of 137)</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you very much</td><td>2</td><td>79 (of 328)</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you so much</td><td>2</td><td>2 (of 6)</td></tr><tr><td>Nice one</td><td>1</td><td>10 (of 78)</td></tr><tr><td>Cheers sweetie</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>

The use of cheers as an expression of gratitude, however, has in the past not been considered to be employed by native speakers of English with as high a frequency as would be necessary to warrant the teaching of this particular meaning in EFL countries. Instead, cheers is commonly taught in the context of dinner parties and other festivities that involve the raising of glasses (Christie, 2005; Haeublein and Jenkins, 2000; Hoffmann and Hoffmann, 2003; Potts and Ramsey, 1993).

The latter use of this lexical item only occurred 29 times in the corpus data out of an overall frequency of 338. In 133 instances cheers is used not as an expression of gratitude but as a responder to an expression of gratitude as in the example below. Where cheers is used in this way it is difficult to determine whether it actually marks gratitude or whether it functions as a discourse marker that signals the end of an encounter or discourse episode.

${ \bf < S 4 > }$ So there might I don’t know whether there might be some mileage in that with from Paul Paul Rowley or from David Grossman or somebody like that.   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ Mm. Yeah. Good point. Okay Alice. No.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S 6 } } >$ Er no sorry.   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ All right.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S } } 3 >$ Okay.   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ Okay thanks.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S } } { \bf { 5 } } { \bf { > } }$ Cheers.   
${ \bf < S 4 > }$ Cheers. Bye.   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ Bye.

The overall breakdown of the different uses of cheers is shown in Table 2.

The high occurrence of cheers as a responder to expressions of gratitude and as a general discourse marker in the corpus data reflects the interactive nature of the corpus which we do not find in the DCT. Since cheers is used first and foremost as an expression of gratitude in both the corpus and the DCT it is very likely that students visiting Great Britain will encounter this lexical item in the function of a marker of gratitude. The diverse use of cheers in the contexts examined in the corpus and the DCT indicate that both instruments together provide a good overview of how this lexical item is used in British English. We therefore suggest that it is worth making EFL students aware of the different discourse functions of cheers.

Table 2 The different uses of cheers   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Cheers as single turn.</td><td>Preceded by expression of gratitude</td><td>Not preceded by expression of gratitude</td><td>Cheers as extended turn</td><td>Preceded by expression of gratitude</td><td>Not preceded by expression of gratitude</td></tr><tr><td>As toast</td><td>17</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>As expression of gratitude</td><td>55</td><td>157</td><td></td><td>56</td><td>23</td></tr></table></body></html>

The main difference between the DCT data and the corpus data lies in the length of the turn in which gratitude is being expressed. Since the DCT focuses on utterances in highly controlled, predetermined conditions and does not, in contrast to authentic or role play conversations, involve a human interlocutor, it cannot provide insights into conversation analytical issues. This clearly is one of the weaknesses of DCT data. Instead, the use of thanking expressions over several conversational turns can be observed very well in the corpus data. The corpus results suggest that one way of expressing gratitude takes the form of ‘gratitude clusters’, i.e., sequences and lexical items of gratitude linked and often repeated in a single turn, as well as across turns. As such, in 353 concordance lines of the word ‘thanks’ we find a repetition either of thanks or thank within five words to the left or the right from the search word, often as part of another speaker’s turn. This type of nonreferential, pragmatic meaning of thanks is often found in ‘gate-keeping’ encounters where the person who is providing a service uses the lexical item thanks to indicate gratitude for the interlocutor’s co-operation. The following example of a service encounter illustrates this point:

${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ The grapes please.   
${ \bf < S 2 > }$ Seventy P.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ Thanks very much. Ta very much.   
${ \bf < S 2 > }$ Four twenty two.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ Thanks.   
${ \bf < S 2 > }$ Thank you.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ Thanks. Thanks a lot.

Looking at the corpus data we can see that longer formulaic expressions such as thank you very much and thanks a lot tend to be used as complete turns more frequently than any of the single lexical items that we investigated. It is also worth noting that the second speaker often employs thank you as a response to their interlocutors’ expression of gratitude. The use of an expression of gratitude as a responder is interesting, since it does not follow typical text book conversations in which a repetition or slight paraphrasing of the preceding thanking formula is not commonly mentioned as a possible responder to an expression of gratitude.

# 6.2. Extended turns and formulaic sequences

Due to the considerable amount of lexico-grammatical variation the task of comparing extended turns in the DCT data and the corpus data are slightly more complicated. We have therefore assigned the more elaborate socio-interactional sequences and formulaic expressions that were used to express gratitude by the native speakers in the DCT to six categories. Table 3 contains the titles of the categories and their frequencies in the DCT and CANCODE data. Each of the categories will be discussed in turn.

The analysis of the corpus data were carried out by searching a tagged corpus for the relevant part of speech information of the sequence identified in the DCT data. A subsequent manual edit of the concordance data were undertaken to eliminate any structures that are not related to the expression of gratitude. The starting point of the sequence was defined as a specific lexical item such as thanks, cheers, etc. and the remainder of the structure was added as a combination of lexical items and tags.

Category 1: Thanking $^ +$ complimenting interlocutor/positive evaluation of previous speaker’s utterance

The native speakers who completed the DCT employed two different sequence structures in this category. The first can be represented as thank[s]2 /cheers [you] [adverbial] that verb [adverbial] adjective. Formulaic sequences formed in this structure were for instance, thanks very much that would be wicked and cheers, that’s really sweet.

The first corpus sequence that we investigated in comparison with the DCT data were cheers [adverbial] that verb [adverbial] adjective and there were no instances of this sequence in the corpus. The second corpus sequence we looked at was Thank you [adverbial] that verb [adverbial] of which there were 16 instances. The concordance output below shows some of these instances:

${ } < \mathbf { S } 1 > { }$ Yes. $< \mathbf { S } 2 >$ Thank you that’s smashing. $< \mathrm { S } 1 > ~ < \mathrm { S } 2 >$ And she n le’s home. ${ } < \mathbf { S } 1 >$ Thank you. That’s very good of you. ${ < } \mathbf { S } { \boldsymbol { 5 } } >$ And I’m sending ${ } < \mathbf { S } 1 > { }$ Thank you. That’s fine that’s lovely. Mhm. Mm. $< \mathbf { S } 2 >$ Is it all That’s brilliant. Thank you very much. That’s much appreciated.

The utterance Thanks very much. That’s great was the only corpus sequence that followed the structure thanks [adverbial] that verb [adverbial]. There are two further instances, which show appreciation of the other speaker, but they do not follow the same structure. These are:Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate all that. and Thanks very much. You’ve been helpful.

The second subcategory to compliment the interlocutor varied more in its form, [that +verb] [adjective], you verb definite article/possessive pronoun noun. It seems remarkable that the four formulaic sequences following this schema in the DCT data centre on very similar concepts and words, namely the adjective wicked and exaggerated noun or verb phrase. It is also interesting to point out that none of the expressions of gratitude in this subcategory contain the form of the stem ‘thank’ or one of the other single lexical items listed in table one such as cheers or ta. The four formulaic sequences are: wicked, mate, you are a legend; wicked, you are a star; mate, you are a lifesaver and that’s great, you saved my life. There were no instances of this structure in the corpus data that carried the function of expressing gratitude.

Table 3 Frequency of sequence categories used to express gratitude   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category type</td><td>DCT</td><td>CANCODE</td></tr><tr><td>(1) Thanking + complimenting interlocutor</td><td>11</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>(2) Thanking + stating reason</td><td>9</td><td>168</td></tr><tr><td>(3) Thanking + confirming interlocutor&#x27;s commitment</td><td>9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>(4) Thanking + stating intent to reciprocate</td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>(5) Thanking + stating interlocutor&#x27;s non-existent obligation</td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>(6) Thanking + refusing</td><td>2</td><td>271</td></tr></table></body></html>

Undoubtedly, the first structure in this category seems to be the less marked and therefore more universally applicable one. The use of wicked with a positive meaning struck us as important, since this word is often taught with a negative meaning, for instance in collocations with attack and evil. Thus, raising EFL students’ awareness regarding the different meanings of this word seems to be worthwhile to avoid misunderstandings. However, there are no instances in the corpus data of this usage. Instead wicked tends to be used mainly as an evaluation of a state of affairs rather than as an expression of gratitude in the corpus.

Category 2: Thanking $^ +$ stating reason

Expressions of gratitude in this category begin with thank[s] [you] [adverbial] for and are then either followed by (a) definite article/possessive pronoun noun structure or by (b) verb+ing [pronoun] in the DCT data. Examples for the two structures are thank you very much for your time (a), thanks for the help (a) and thanks for coming (b). The majority of the expressions in this category were used in scenario A3 in which the students are asked to thank a lecturer for an extensive explanation. Teaching the two forms of this structure can be very useful for students as it enables them to select either form based on their vocabulary proficiency. In addition, this formulaic sequence structure can also be used for word mapping exercises that further expand the students’ vocabulary. The teacher could for instance ask which other nouns or verbs can be employed in the structure, such as assistance, patience and calling. A comparison with corpus data shows that this structure is the one most frequently used by native speakers. There are 68 instances of thank you for and 100 instances of thanks for.

# Category 3: Thanking $^ +$ confirming interlocutor’s commitment

Structures in this category vary considerably, but they have one thing in common, either at the end or the beginning of the utterance, followed by or preceding the expression of gratitude, they contain the sequence are you sure [you] [don’t] [verb] [pronoun] or, in one case the word really. Examples of these structures found in the DCT data are: Are you sure you don’t mind? Great, thanks.; Really? Thanks. and Are you sure? Ok, thanks. The majority of native speakers used these formulaic sequences to confirm their interlocutor’s willingness in scenario A8 in which a friend invites them to a coffee. Other instances were found in situations A2 (‘book’) and A7 (‘handout’). From a methodological point of view, the aforementioned examples are also very interesting as they show that discourse completion tasks can also generate utterances that would normally be realized in two consecutive turns, broken up by the interlocutor’s positive confirmation of intent. An investigation of this structure in the corpus reveals, however, that there are no instances of confirming interlocutor’s commitment following the lexical item ‘thanks’ or the structure ‘thank you’.

Category 4: Thanking $^ +$ stating intent to reciprocate

All formulaic sequences in this category were found in scenario A8 (‘coffee’) in the DCT data and therefore seem to indicate a strong contextual connection to the buying of beverages. In contrast to category 3, the linguistic realization of expressing gratitude and stating one’s intent to reciprocate appears to be much more standardized: thanks I’ll get/buy pronoun adverbial of time, for example thanks very much I’ll get it next time. Two native speakers also used more than one formulaic sequence, namely Are you sure? Thanks, I’ll buy yours tomorrow. While the use of two or more formulaic sequences to express gratitude is quite common in the corpus data there are no instances of the particular structure thanking $^ +$ stating intent to reciprocate in the corpus. This is interesting, since this formulaic sequence was also observed by Eisenstein and Bodman (1986, p. 182) in their DCT data, e.g., Thanks for the lunch. I’ll take you out next week or Thank you for lunch. Next time it’s my treat. In their 1988 follow-up study they compared expressions of gratitude gathered with their DCT and in role-plays to field notes taken of naturally occurring data. They found that all three data sets contained ‘‘the same words and expressions that were elicited by the written questionnaire’’ (p. 3). One possible explanation for the absence of the category in the CANCODE corpus data might be that the use of this structure depends very much on the specific situational conditions and the interlocutors’ relationship that might not be covered in the same way in the corpus as it is in the DCT. Another possible explanation is that this discrepancy may be due to the fact that the participants in the discourse completion task had more time to think about their response and have therefore opted to produce an additional politeness strategy. Naturally occurring discourse on the other hand tends to require faster processing of information and speech which may be the reason why we tend to find more repetitive gratitude formulae in preference to an accumulation of different types of politeness strategies.

Category 5: Thanking $^ +$ stating interlocutor’s non-existent obligation

Similar to category 4, formulaic sequences in this category are also used by the native speaker in only one DCT scenario, situation A5 in which the participants are asked to thank a friend who has bought them a birthday present. The expression of gratitude either precedes or follows the statement of the interlocutor’s non-existent obligation and is realized by either (a) a form based on the stem ‘thank’ or (b) a positive exclamation. The formulaic sequence concerning the gift giver’s obligation is then structure as follows: you shouldn’t/didn’t have [to do that]. Examples found in the DCT data are: thank you, but you shouldn’t have (a); you didn’t have to do that, thanks (a) and wow, you shouldn’t have (b). This is another category for which there is no evidence in the corpus data.

The formulaic sequence You shouldn’t have/didn’t have to do that was also found by Bodman and Eisenstein (1988) and Eisenstein and Bodman (1986, 1993). In contrast to category 4, however, the examples in their studies do not clearly indicate that this expression was either preceded or followed by a form of thanks. Instead, one of their examples resembles our DCT example (b) above in that it conveys positive emotions followed by the formulaic sequence, namely Oh, that’s really nice! You didn’t have to do that! (1986, p. 183). One of the explanations for the non-existence of this category in the CANCODE data might therefore be a result of the way in which we searched for the strategy, which inevitably has to involve a particular lexical item (in this case thanks or thank you). However, this category may not include those particular lexical items but other structures of expressing gratitude.

# Category 6: Thanking $^ +$ refusing

Knowing the right words to politely reject an offer is essential in every language. Unfortunately, the DCT data only contains two instances for this important category that were used in scenario A8 (‘coffee’), Ah, no, it’s ok thanks and No, honestly, that’s fine. But thank you anyway. This last category is by far the most common as far as the corpus data are concerned. There are 136 instances where the lexical item ‘no’ is used in the vicinity of the item ‘thanks’ (within a span of two to either side of the node) and 135 instances where ‘no’ occurs in the vicinity of thank you. These results seem to suggest that the ability to express gratitude and at the same time to refuse a proposition is one of the main skills that students may need to possess in a native speaker context.

However, it is the lowest category in the DCT data. Thus, this finding again seems to indicate that using a combination of both corpus and DCT data to inform teaching material would provide learners with a good repertoire of different formulaic sequences in expressions of gratitude.

# 6.3. Pedagogical implications

The results of our investigation thus suggest that one strength of data elicited via a DCT is the wide range of interactional formulaic sequences that it provides. Thus, DCTs could be exchanged in school and university cooperation programmes in which institutions in two countries work together to provide their students with more insights into the language and culture of each other’s countries. DCTs tailored for the specific purposes and contexts of the educational institutions could be used in the language classroom to provide learners with a wide variety of possible formulaic sequences in a number of controlled situations.

Another advantage of exchanging DCTs is that learners would be given the opportunity to observe very recent changes in word meanings and use of formulaic sequences, such as wicked in a positive sense. One of the questions that arises in this context is, whether EFL learners really need to be taught the different, rather casual ways in which formulaic sequences such as That’s wicked or single expressions such as cheers are used. It is questionable whether it is useful to include these examples in learners’ core vocabulary since (a) they are rather specific to certain varieties of English and (b) less marked forms such as That’s great or thanks provide learners with sufficient means to achieve their communicative goals. However, raising awareness of such forms may be beneficial to students who are likely to encounter English native speaking peers, especially if these are not covered by traditional teaching materials.

A combined use of both data types, DCT and corpus data, would seem particularly helpful in the teaching context since it would enable the learners to look at pre-determined highly controlled contexts and the much broader picture. One of the advantages of examining the broader picture provided by the corpus data are that this data type offers insights into the procedural aspects of expressing gratitude which the DCT is unable to provide. These include repeated patterns of collaborative negotiation of the expression of gratitude with one speaker repeating and/or re-lexicalising the utterance of the other as the following example of the end of a service encounter illustrates:

${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ Yeah. ${ \mathrm { < S E > } }$ laughs $\mathrm { < } \backslash \mathrm { S E > }$ Thank you.   
${ \bf < S 2 > }$ Thank you.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ That’s lovely.   
${ \bf < S 2 > }$ All right. And your balance is sixty nine thirty six then.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ Right. ${ \mathrm { < S E > } }$ pause $\angle \mathrm { S E } >$ Thank you. Sixty-nine? ${ \bf < S 2 > }$ Er thirty six.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf S } 1 >$ Thirty six. Right.   
${ \bf < S 2 > }$ Thank you.

This kind of discourse structure is extremely common in the corpus data especially in contexts where there is a high degree of convergence between the speakers. The encounter also gives additional information about the consistency of the discourse (e.g., laughter and pauses). Such features represent important interpersonal information, which is, along with false starts and hesitations, impossible to capture through DCTs.

Another issue that was only partly covered in the DCT results is the predominance of extended turns used to express gratitude. In the majority of utterances including the lexical item ‘thanks’ in the corpus, we find additional sequences or lexical items that express gratitude. As such this observation becomes a general rule in the corpus data rather than an exception as it is in the DCT data. The following example illustrates this tendency:

${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S } } 2 { \bf { > } }$ It was on the trolley.   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ Yeah.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S } } 2 { \bf { > } }$ [unintelligible]   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ Was it Sally?   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S } } 2 { \bf { > } }$ Er yeah   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ another trolley.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S } } 2 { \bf { > } }$ [unintelligible]   
${ \bf { < S l > } }$ Oh right. Oh great stuff. That’s brilliant. Thank you very much. That’s much appreciated.   
${ \bf \mathrm { < } } { \bf { S } } 2 { \bf { > } }$ Where you gonna put it?

# 7. Conclusion

Our study has generated some preliminary results derived from a comparison of expressions of gratitude between DCT data and corpus data. We acknowledge that too much should not be claimed for the results until larger data sets, especially in terms of the DCT data, are examined. However, our main aim has been to investigate whether DCT and corpus data can supply language teachers with a good selection of possible formulaic sequences that are used by native speakers.

It should be noted that the original purpose of the DCT has traditionally been to create a controlled setting and to gather cross-linguistic data for analysis. The corpus as a resource stands in stark contrast to the DCT as the individual interactions in a corpus do not occur in a controlled environment. The aim of most corpus linguists is to describe patterns of general language use rather than to analyse individual utterances in a highly controlled context. And while the DCT may go a long way in providing data that is controlled for speaker relationship, language proficiency or nationality of the subjects it can never provide the same variety of discourse contexts as the corpus. The main difference between the two resources lies in the point at which categorization takes place. In the case of the DCT the categories inform the instrument while in the case of the corpus the data often tends to inform the categories. Both have their distinct place in current research but we have attempted here to discuss whether the two can be consolidated in any way in the language-teaching context.

Our investigation of expressions of gratitude in the DCT and corpus data has revealed that the data elicited with the discourse completion task contained a great variety of interactional formulaic sequence categories that can be linked to a controlled contextual environment, while the corpus data provided detailed insights into additional situational thanking contexts and the use of expressions of gratitude over several conversational turns. Based on our findings we suggest that a combination of both data sets could be a useful addition to existing English language teaching resources.

You:

(A2) You have to read a chapter in a certain book for one of your assignments which is due in one week. All the copies of the book in the library are on loan and it would take too long to order it from a bookshop. You meet a friend in front of the union shop and tell her about it.

You: It’s really awful! I just can’t get hold of this book and I have to read it for Dr. X’s assignment!

She: It’s Chapter 8, isn’t it? The article by this Australian woman?

You: Yes, that’s right! Do you have it?

She: Yes, I had to read it for Dr. X’s class last semester. I’ll bring it in for you tomorrow.

You:

(A3) You were not able to attend the last seminar and have difficulties understanding one of the central points of this seminar. After the seminar is over, you approach the lecturer, who has a very good relationship with all of his students. You tell him that you did not understand one of the central points and ask him whether he could explain it to you. He explains the point in detail and even draws a diagram.

Lecturer: Well, I hope that it’s clear now.

You:

(A4) You are in a corridor in the university walking towards a door. Just before you reach it, it is pushed open from the other side. Another students steps through. He sees you and holds the door open for you. You pass by him.
