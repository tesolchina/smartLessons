‘Writing one's own paper but   
including passages copied exactly   
from the work of another’

Possible 2 factors associated with academic infractions in Japanese coursework writing

Accuracy

GT’s ‘accuracy was patchy and at times   
led to a breakdown of clarity’ (Groves   
& Mundt, 2015, 117). COHERENCE A piece of writing is coherence if it is   
Coherence clearly organised and has a logical sequence of ideas.

# When breakdown of accuracy occurs

Stage 1   
Choose the correct words   
Stage 2   
Construct well-formed sentences

# When breakdown of coherence

occurs

Paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph.

Stage 3

Paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph.

Paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph.

Link these sentence together into clear coherent and cohesive paragraph

Stage 4 Aligning the writing to the expectation of   
the readership   
e.g. incomplete sentences repetition of the same information or words

# Accuracy vs. Creativity

Value accuracy

Higher marks are given to the students who produced writing with accurate vocabulary and grammar use

Value creativity

![](img/6154b6d42053bba69ebc3fc1bd7e93f3934d8ab999b109b753748855c7f4faff.jpg)

Higher marks are given to the students who use more advanced vocabulary and grammar which is beyond their level in spite of students’ errors

# Method

Participants:

3 second year undergraduate students who studied Absolute Beginners’ Japanese in the previous year, but with no basic understanding or knowledge of the Japanese language. This study was conducted in autumn term of 2017.

GT is not always reliable, but it is still considered a better option for lower track students

# The coursework assignment

# Visitor Guide

Your tutor will set a task around designing a guide or brochure for a group of student visitors.

Choose an interesting location near your home town or university Write a brochure for a group of university students who are planning a visit to your home town or university. The guide will be written in the language you are learning, and include the following:

0 some background history a map / plan places to visit   
0 reasons to visit them   
0 information about transport   
0 local event/s   
0 seasonal information   
0 prices pictures

Findings 1) Illogical and unclear link between sentences in a paragraph

The MTR (subway) is the fastest transportation in Hong Kong many people use it every day. The railroad, bus, minibus and ferry in the region are mostly part of the octopus card (Echinetsu–electronic payment method that can be used in public transportation, etc.). Four Seasons Hotel is a 5 star hotel. It is located in the center of Hong Kong. It has a swimming pool, conference room, spa and restaurant. In the Spring Festival this is the most important holiday in Greater China. For the history of the Spring Festival, private folklore has spread to the private sector for ten years. Paste every year's paintings, etc. at the entrance of the house, and paste paper on windows, etc.’

# 2) Repetition

# Paragraph 1

‘I am an international student who came from China and is studying at a University in the UK. My hometown is Wuhan in the middle of China. Wuhan has a long history, famous tourist spots are known in the world. There are delicious foods that are characteristic there, and there are also enthusiastic Wuhan people.

# Paragraph 2

The transportation of Wuhan is convenient, there are airports and four high-speed railroads, which are located in each district. Since Wuhan is located in the middle of China, it is close to other towns. Geographical location makes it convenient for travel and work.

# Paragraph 3

Economic cities in central China are mainly in Wuhan. There is the biggest department store in Wuhan. The design of this department store is unique, there are various items in it, if you get tired when shopping, there is also a movie theatre in the department store, if you see a movie there.’

# 3)incomplete sentence

中国中部の経済都市は武漢を中心に（shouldaddあります）。

Economic cities in central China _ mainly in Wuhan.

This Japanese sentence is incomplete and あり ますshould have been added.

# 4) Inconsistency: mixed forms of polite and dictionary forms at the end of sentences

中華人民共和国香港特別行政区1997年7月1日イギリスから中華人民共和国への返還, 中華人民共和国の南部にある特別行政区である香港は、九龍半島、新界香港島235以上 $\oslash$ 島が漂っています。 . DictionPolite form aryform

Hong Kong Special   
Administrative Region of China July 1, 1997 was returned from the UK to the People’s Republic of China, is a special   
administrative district in the   
southern part of the People's Republic of China. Hong Kong consists of 235 islands including the Kowloon Peninsula, New   
Territories.

# Student 1

‘I am a student. I am from China and I am studying at a University in the UK.

# Student 2

‘I am an international student who came from China and is studying at the University in the UK. My hometown is Wuhan in the middle of China.

# Institutions

# ‘Students’ page

‘If your tutor thinks you have plagiarised, they will refer it to an Investigating Officer who will determine whether there is a case to be answered for or not. If it is your first offence of plagiarism you will be referred to an Academic Practice Workshop, rather than being questioned by your Head of School (for a minor case) or being brought in front of a Misconduct Panel (for a major case)’.

# School and Services’ page

‘Concerns regarding academic misconduct must be considered seriously and referred to the Module Convenor. Where a concern has been raised, the student will be given an opportunity to present their case. For cases of academic misconduct which are proven, a penalty will be applied. Penalties that can be applied are detailed in section 2.9.13 of the Examination and Assessment Regulations Handbook’.

# Teachers

In setting essay assignment, don’t make questions which require students to use beyond what they were taught.

Inform students the focus is on accuracy or creativity.

![](img/cffba815b03cebe3de7ec85bcf6198cd6862aa8d9c888bfda5f51e3aa9dd44c4.jpg)

Familiarise yourself with institution’s specific regulations regarding plagiarism and impart them to the students

# Students

Students are not expected to rely on GT to do their language coursework.   
Students should take responsibilities in their own learning and their action which includes facing the consequences of their actions and getting   
information about plagiarism and academic   
infractions.
