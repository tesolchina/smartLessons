A majority of research in the field of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) occurs within an English language program. Indeed, EAP would most likely not exist as an area of academic inqury without such programs, and each program requires an administrative structure that ensures successful operations. The administration of English language programs is an inherent and necessary area of professinal engagement for EAP, as program administrators are responsible for managing the primary contexts of reearch in the field.

English Language Program Administration: Leadership and Management in the 21st Century is the most recent edited volume by MaryAnn Christison and Fredricka Stoler. It follows their previous respected volumes of A Handbook for Language Program Administrators (1997, 2012), as well as numerous other colaborative and independent publications on the subject. They re also coauthors on several chapters of the present volume. The book is number 59 of Springer's Educational Linguistics series, which seeks to support \*research that crosses traditional disciplinary, theoretical, and/or methodological boundaries in ways that advance knowledge about language (in) education" and \*focuses on critical and contextualized work that ofers altenatives to current aproaches as well as practical, substantive ways forward front matter). The theoretical nuance applied to the range of activities that Language Program Administrators (LPAs) encounter throughout their careers (e.g., crisis management, personnel matters, decision-making, ethical finance practices, and so forth) makes this volume ideall suited for English language teaching practitioners actively working as administrators, instructors with administrative duties, or professionals moving into administration, although educator f preservice teachers may nevertheless find several chapters relevant to their syllabi.

The volume is divided into four sections, which are differently useful to LPAs and other active practitioners, depending upon where they are in their careers and their context of engagement. Epigraphs at the start of each chapter as well as bibliographic references frequently extend beyond ELT and EAP to areas such as business and human resources, highlighting the cross disciplinary nature of program administration. Each chapter ends with a set f reflection questions and suggested readings; comprehensive cros-referencing throughout the chapters integrates and juxtaposes concepts across the contributions.

The first section following the introduction contains three chapters that are primarily oriented toward new LPAs. The initial chapter, for instance, inroduces fundamental concepts of program management to teachers who are transitioning into administrative roles, followed by achapter that summarizes the results of an empirical study that considers the most important responsibilities of program admnistration according to LPAs - namely, program mssion, vision, and goal statements; program effectiveness curriculum, student proficiency asessments; and teacher supervision. This pair of chapters emphasizes the dynamic nature of program admin istration (as, of course, do other chapters throughout the volume), reminding new LPAs to expect the unexpected, prepare for change, anticipatesignificant on-the-job learning, and be willing to tolerate competing pressures within a program. The final chapter of this section offers an overview of various types of language programs (e.g., adult education programs, binational centers, international schools primary and secondary schools, private language schools, refugee-resettlement programs, and university-based English language programs), demonstrating the diverst of contexts in which EAP reearch occurs. While each context requires aunique set f skills, advice provided throughout the volume highlights the similarities within diversty - that i, diffrent contexts require not so much completely different skill sets but rather shifting priorities depending on program missions and goals.

The second section of eight chapters comprises the majority of the volume. For readers with LPA experience, the themes covered in this section will be famliar (., inovation, stratc planing, qualit assurance, inecural competence, and so forth), but at the same time even experienced LPAs will find reason to pause and reflect. In the first chapter of this section, Kleckova, Murray, and Christison encourage LPAs to conduct aself-audit in which they reflect upon their personal values and belief and consider how these attitudes are realized within their own programs and how they impact the wider field. In a subsequent chapter, Hiler similarl describes self-awareness as one of the 'key" qualities t increased sensitivity, a heightened awareness of one's environment, and enhanced communication and social sils" (p. 132). Overall the contributions i thsection recommend that LPAs be ableto discuss sophisticated understandings of language learning through active engagement with professional associations and familiarity with publications centered on language and language pedagogy. LPAs also must recognize the various types of advocacy and the importance of each type in order to support both their students and programs. As Brisow & Soppelsa state, LPAs must be able to "engage, energize, and empower language program faculty through consultative management, participatory decision making, and ongoing professional development" (p. 168).

Contributors throughout the volume acknowledge that language programs, regardlessof context, are labor-intensive operations, and change is an inherent part of any program. In providing LPAs advice for dealing with typical change, the five chapters in section three often come across as a type of "self-help manual. Sgestions for dealing with isues such as difficult personnel matters, new technologies, finances, and time management are valuable not only for LPAs but also for other professionals in academia or most any business-oriented feld, and, i fact, citations throughout this section tend to be more cros dsciplinary than elsewhere. Ths section accurately portrays change as a fundamental part of an LPA's professional experience, but at times also gives the impression that change is predictable and perhaps even something distributed over longer time periods. Practicing LPAs, however, will most likely attest that regardles of preventative measures undertaken, change frequently occurs in unexpected ways, and it often takes place much more quickly than one can control.

The self-help approach continues into the final section of the volume, which consiss of a single chapter whimsicall titld "Best Practices Based on $^ { 3 6 0 + }$ Years of Administrative Experience.' Compiled from 18 professionals with over 360 years of combined administrative experience, this last chapter presents 66 suggestions for best practices. While severa sugestions inevitably overlap, a surprising number of the suggestions are unique, again reinforcing recognition of the diversity of LPA work, the importance of context, and need to acknowledge the possibilities and limitations of one's own abilities.

The inspirational content and encouragement toward reflexivity in one's practice, however, is at times unintentionally offet through the bald accetance of neoliberal deals of quality, succes, and business. Several contributions use the concept of \*customer" to describe students, and the concept of language programs as "business' is prevalent throughout. Kiddle and Wigglesworth, for example, rightly lament that \*the term high qualit' is used so often that it has become meaningles" (p. 103). Yet their ttempts to provide meaning to "quality" repeatedly orient toward the "customer, and while the authors do acknowledge that their customers are also students (the true marker of qualit . is determined by how consumers (i.e., students) respond to and sses a language program' [p. 109) students are positioned more for their value as sources of revenue than as communicatie partners. The pressures of maintaining rogram solvency present aprecarious balance between business and education with which LPAs must constantly engage, and this tension is evident throughout the volume as contributors shift from discussing well-being and pedagogy to more neoliberally oriented issues such as stakeholder satisfaction. In a contribution on financial management, Murray introduces the concept of fduciary responsibilit, r \*duty of care," which she defines as a language program's responsibility for the welfaref students, student learning and \*their socio-psychological/emotional and physical health (p. 249). According to Murray, the management of financial resources isa student service and the responsibility of the LPA, yet she never really unpacks how duty of care should impact finances and financial decision-making. To this end, the volume lacks criticality toward the neoliberal orientations that tend to dominate much of the positioning of language programs within the field.

While a majority of ontributions in the volume originate from North American contexts, the content itself is usually presented in a manner that is sfficiently general to be pplicable t other places around the world, especily if one kees in mind that program tye and administrative structure vary immensely even within a single region. Readers must understand their own language programs well enough to be able to select the contributions most relevant for their own contexts. Novice LPAs should be cautioned that adminstrators do not always have as much control over some aspects of their programs as these contributions occasionally suggest. Student enrollments in a program, for example, are impacted by global politics and educational trends, and the design of learning outcomes and curricula are influncey crrn trends within the wider arf aplied inguistics and it subields. verall, howeer, this volume is a highly valuable contribution to the literature on language programs and language program management, and it is a recommended resource for novice as well as more experienced professionals. The volume acutely portrays the necessary knowledge base for LPAs, demonstrates the diversity of programmatic and administrative contexts, and advances theorization of language program management through empirical and practical experience.
