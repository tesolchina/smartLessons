# ABSTRACT

The objective of this study was twofold: (a) to determine the extent to which three types of instruction could improve writing performance of railway engineering students and (b) to explore students’ perceptions of flipped classroom, Edmodo, and Google Docs for improving their academic writing performance. The participants were 61 undergraduate students of railway engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), who were divided into integrated flipped, conventional flipped, and traditional non-flipped groups. For the integrated flipped group, the inquiry-based learning was conducted in terms of five phases of orientation, conceptualization, investigation, data interpretation, and conclusion. They also used Edmodo and Google Docs as the two collaborative platforms for promoting writing skills. The conventional group only watched the instructional videos before the class, while for the traditional group neither the instructional videos nor the technological tools were used for improving their writing skills. The results of ANOVA revealed significant differences among the three groups in that learners in the integrated flipped group significantly outperformed those in the other groups, particularly in terms of the components of grammar and fluency. In addition, this approach made the learners more engaged, motivated, satisfied, and less anxious. The results also showed learners’ positive attitudes toward the pedagogical values of Edmodo and Google Docs.

# Introduction

English for Academic Purposes (EAP) students need writing to share their scientific findings with the world outside (Soodmand Afshar &

Movassagh, 2016). However, writing is considered the most challenging skill among the other language skills by language learners (Fathi & Rahimi, 2020; Xu & Qi, 2017). According to Ebadi and Rahimi (2018), writing is a complex process, which demands several linguistic proficiencies, including grammar, organization, vocabulary range, coherence, and cohesion. Therefore, it can cause potential challenges, such as writing anxiety (Fareed et  al., 2016) and frustration and difficulty in writing (Xu & Qi, 2017). Chen (2002) notes that learners have problems with writing due to their unawareness of the adequate grammatical and lexical knowledge, various genres of writing, and their relevant organizational structures. As indicated by Sharples (1993), the nature and complexity of writing in an EFL context may cause a demotivating learning environment, which ends in learners’ negative attitudes. Moreover, Buitrago and Diaz (2018) assert that traditional and teacher-centered writing classrooms cannot maintain or enhance learners’ motivation. Hence, to help them improve their writing, foreign language teachers, educators, and researchers have been looking for new methods to improve their styles of instruction delivery to enhance learners’ writing skills and to create more enjoyable learning environments (Ekmekci, 2017).

It is argued that flipped classroom is an effective approach to teaching writing skill, as it can efficiently address the challenges of learning writing due to its beneficial characteristics, such as its flexibility which allows learners to study before the class at their own pace to become fully prepared for in-class activities without stress and frustration (Fathi & Rahimi, 2020; Leis et  al., 2015). Su Ping et  al. (2020) note that in the flipped writing classrooms learners prepare themselves before the class to create a basic knowledge of academic writing, while inside the class they have sufficient time to boost the knowledge through discussing about the subject of writing with their peers and instructor, sharing ideas with each other, writing together, and receiving feedback. Ekmekci (2017) states that flipped classroom leads to change in the negative attitudes toward writing skill and enhancing learners’ motivation for writing paragraphs. However, traditional approaches to teaching are still implemented in the EFL writing contexts, including Iranian higher education (Naghdipour, 2016).

Although implementing flipped classroom approach to teaching is interesting, and a growing number of studies (e.g. Adnan, 2017; Hung, 2017; Koroglu & Cakir, 2017; Lin & Hwang, 2018; Shyr & Chen, 2018; Sun et  al., 2016; Turan & Goktas, 2018) have been conducted on its impact on language learning, this approach is still at its early stage, and there is an insufficient literature on the good quality of in-class and out-of-class materials, detailed and specific techniques for flipped practice, teaching theories and strategies, sufficient support, and appropriate designs (Jiang et  al., 2020). Zou et  al. (2020) similarly argue that researchers are still not certain about the best way to implement the flipped model and are still theorizing about this concept, indicating that flipped classroom is in its initial development and should be more investigated. Moreover, Yang et  al. (2018) note that there should be an effective way for teachers to support students in accomplishing their out-of-class activities in a flipped classroom. Flipped classroom has become a hot pedagogical approach in the field of EFL (Jiang et  al., 2020; Koroglu & Cakir, 2017; Mehring, 2016; Wang et  al., 2018); however, there are still numerous calls in the literature for further research to probe into the impact of flipped classroom on the EFL learners’ writing skill development (e.g. Ekmekci, 2017; Wu et  al., 2019).

Moreover, it is found that integrating online tools into writing practice is an effective pedagogical approach to reducing learners’ negative attitudes and anxiety for learning writing skills (Chen, Chuah et  al., 2015; Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Sun & Qiu, 2014; Yang, 2011). Tsiakyroudi (2018) argues that implementing online writing tools can promote learners’ writing motivation. Wu et  al. (2019) note that using flipped approach and online tools in writing classes has a positive impact on learners’ writing proficiency, particularly on improving word choice, coherent ideas, and grammatical rules. According to Egbert et  al. (2014), through using flipped classroom in computer supported language learning environments, learners are provided with grammatical rules, lexical items, and other linguistic features before the class through online tools and instructional materials. Ayres (2002) asserts that learners’ individual and collective perceptions must be investigated in the technology-based language classrooms. In the same vein, Jaramillo (2019) states that learners’ perceptions should be evaluated when the innovative technology-based teaching approaches, including flipped classroom are used in language classes to allow instructors to know how learners feel or react to these approaches.

It has also been suggested that one of the most favorable ways to cover content, provide more guidance and support, and enhance benefits of flipped classroom may be the combination of this approach with the inquiry-based learning (Chen & Chang, 2017; Huang & Lin, 2017). Kreber (2006) notes that this approach provides sufficient support for learners; improves development of mental processes; and enhances problem solving, argumentation, and reasoning skills. Furthermore, Dellatola et  al. (2020) found that the combination of inquiry-based learning, flipped classroom, and collaborative learning in a computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is beneficial for language learning and teaching. However, there has been little research (e.g. Dellatola et al., 2020; Hung, 2015) on the integration of these approaches, particularly the impact of such integration on EAP students’ writing performance. To this end, to enhance the academic writing performance of students of railway engineering, flipped classroom was used. However, to provide sufficient support to learners, the inquiry-based learning approach was combined with the flipped classroom. In addition to implementing the integrated flipped classroom, online tools were used for providing the instructional materials and enhancing collaboration among learners. The two collaborative writing platforms chosen for this study were Edmodo and Google Docs. Through Edmodo, the instructors could present instructional materials, and learners had the opportunity to share their ideas and materials with their peers during the inquiry-based learning stages. Furthermore, Google Docs provides a collaborative learning environment due to useful elements, such as edit option, simultaneous feedback, chatting with instructor and other students, saving changes and retrieving previous versions, and offering clear online tutorials and help sections (Ragupathi, 2013). To further explore the experiences, preferences, and challenges of using Edmodo and Google Docs, learners’ perceptions of these two platforms were examined.

# Review of the related literature

# Flipped classroom

Historically, the term ‘flipped classroom’ or ‘inverted classroom’ has been used to describe a recent model in which activities, including content presentation traditionally performed in the class become home activities, while activities and homework become classroom tasks (Bergmann & Sams, 2012; Karabulut-Ilgu et  al., 2018; Sohrabi & Iraj, 2016). Hughes (2012) asserts that flipped classroom is an approach, providing interaction between students and teachers through inverting inside and outside of classroom events with the support of digital technologies. According to Betihavas et  al. (2016), unlike traditional classroom learning where teachers are considered the transmitters of knowledge and learners as the passive individuals, a flipped classroom approach is student-centered, requiring learners to be active and responsible participants in their own learning. As a consequence of receiving the instructional materials before the class, there would be more time inside the class to work on problems, advanced concepts, and learning misconceptions, having the opportunity to be engaged with collaborative learning under the teachers’ guidance (Chen Hsieh et  al., 2017).

# Advantages of flipped classroom

Some researchers (e.g. McDonald & Smith, 2013; Nguyen et  al., 2016) have stated that flexibility of flipped classroom model in delivering the instructional materials before the class time enables learners to learn anytime and anywhere. According to Hsu et  al. (2019), learners’ control over their learning pace and process in flipped classrooms enhances their autonomy and learning motivation. Moreover, this instructional model can provide an interactive learning environment (Chuang et  al., 2018). Learners’ collaboration, interaction, and engagement are also found the key elements in this theory of learning (Neo & Neo, 2009). As indicated by Webb and Doman (2019), in a flipped classroom, learners are provided with more opportunities for practicing writing and speaking and receiving more feedback from their peers and instructors. In addition, flipped writing classrooms can promote learners’ grammatical knowledge (Webb & Doman, 2016). Su Ping et  al. (2020) maintain that due to the process of scaffolding learning, through preparation before the class time and the immediate feedback provided by the peers and instructors in the flipped classroom, even the low-proficient learners are motivated to write in the EFL classes. Some other advantages of flipped classroom include:

enhancing opportunities to carry out higher order thinking tasks (Alsowat, 2016),   
increasing levels of self-regulation (Lai & Hwang, 2016),   
improving confidence (Sockalingam et  al., 2016; Su Ping et  al., 2020),   
promoting creativity (Al-Zahrani, 2015),   
improving ICT skills (Huang & Hong, 2016),   
providing flexible learning environment (McDonald & Smith, 2013; Nguyen et  al., 2016),   
fostering motivation (Boyraz & Ocak, 2017; Su Ping et  al., 2020), reducing anxiety (Teo et  al., 2014),   
increasing students’ engagement (Amiryousefi, 2017; Chen Hsieh et  al., 2017; Su Ping et  al., 2020),   
developing problem solving skills (Chen, Chen et  al., 2015), being time efficient (Davies et  al., 2013),   
increasing student-centeredness and success (Amiryousefi, 2017; Baepler et  al., 2014; Davies et  al., 2013; O’Flaherty & Phillips, 2015; Webb & Doman, 2016),   
enhancing understanding of content (Roux & Nagel, 2018), improving learning performance (Bhagat et  al., 2016; Cheng et  al., 2018; Ishikawa et  al., 2015; Van Alten et  al., 2019),

enhancing learner satisfaction (Turan & Goktas, 2016), and providing sufficient time for automatizing the declarative knowledge (Moranski & Kim, 2016).

# Challenges of flipped classroom

In spite of all the above-mentioned advantages, some challenges are suggested for flipping instruction, which include being time-consuming in terms of implementation due to providing materials and designing in-class and out-class activities (Wanner & Palmer, 2015), experience of failure by learners who are not able to schedule their time to study out-of-class learning materials (Lai & Hwang, 2016), being less effective for learners with low self-regulatory behavior (Sun et  al., 2016), and instructors’ inability to know if students have watched the instructional videos or not (Fautch, 2015). Sayeski et  al. (2015) also found that learners’ limited preparation before the class time diminishes the advantages of flipped classroom.

According to Kim et  al. (2014), while flipped classroom is an effective pedagogical learning approach, one problem for implementing this approach is that most instructors limit the concept of flipped classroom to replacement of in-class instruction with videos prior to the class time and using the class time for homework. Similarly, Webb and Doman (2019) state that more choices of technology can be used in flipped classrooms rather than videos as the instructional materials. Kim et  al. (2014) also argue that efficient learning outcomes are achieved as long as proper learning contents and suitable guidance are provided. A number of researchers (e.g. Akçayir & Akçayir, 2018; Kim et  al., 2014; Sun et  al., 2016) have argued that the method of self-learning before the class is not sufficient in flipped classrooms, since there would be more beneficial outcomes if instructors could provide learners with more interactional tools to help them receive feedback and perform the activities outside the class. Jaramillo (2019) also claims that flipping a classroom should not be limited to only connecting the online content with the class activities; rather, it should consider the innovative pedagogical approaches and appropriate technology.

# Related studies on flipped classroom

In a quasi-experimental research, Hung (2015) examined the impact of flipped classroom on 75 first-year Taiwanese language learners’ academic performance and learning perception with a specific emphasis on engaging them in the class through a WebQuest as an active learning strategy, using three models of structured flipped classroom using WebQuest, semi-structured flipped classroom using Ted-Ed videos, and non-flipped classroom using traditional lecture delivery. The findings revealed that the structured and semi-structured flipped classrooms were more effective in improving students’ perceptions and performance compared with the non-flipped classroom. While significant group differences were not identified among the three groups, structured flipped classroom was shown to be more effective, since learners achieved the highest mean score compared to the other groups. The structured and semi-structured groups also reported higher levels of satisfaction compared to the non-flipped group. However, there was not a significant difference between the structured and semi-structured groups in their overall satisfaction. In another study by Leis et  al. (2015), the impact of flipped classroom on improving English composition writing of 22 Japanese university students was investigated. Leis et  al. compared a traditional English composition course and a flipped model for composition writing. The results showed that the learners receiving flipped instruction generated a significantly higher number of words in their essays, showed improvement in their linguistic knowledge, and revealed significantly greater improvements in their writing performance.

Ekmekci (2017) investigated the impact of flipped classroom on 43 EFL learners’ writing skill. A mixed-methods research design was employed by using a semi-structured interview after the treatment. The findings showed that learners in the experimental group outperformed those in the control group after receiving treatment. Learners in the experimental group also showed positive attitudes toward the flipped model and held the view that flipped classroom was more enjoyable, as it was flexible, allowing learners to learn anywhere and anytime. In another study, Soltanpour and Valizadeh (2018) explored the effect of flipped approach on 55 Iranian EFL learners’ argumentative essay writing. The results indicated that the learners in the flipped group significantly outperformed those in the traditional group. The results also revealed that the success emerged in the flipped group was not only because of the inverted delivery of instruction, but also because of the learners’ higher engagement in the learning process and using the collaborative writing.

# Inquiry-based learning

In inquiry-based learning, according to Deboer (2006), learners are engaged in searching for activities to acquire knowledge the same way scientists perform research. Inquiry-based learning is considered a set of strategies employed to improve learning through learners’ active and independent exploration of questions, problems, and issues (Lee et  al.,

2004). Pedaste et  al. (2012) note that this pedagogical approach is the process of testing a hypothesis and analyzing the findings of the experiments or observations. Bybee et  al. (2006) also suggest an inquiry cycle consisting of five inquiry phases, namely engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation, which enable students to construct their understanding of a concept across time.

Inquiry-based approach refers to a student-centered method of teaching in which learners raise questions, explore situations, and develop their own solutions to problems (Justice et  al., 2007; Kim & Chin, 2011). Inquiry-based learning is deemed as a learner-centered approach, focusing on problem solving, critical thinking, and questioning in which learners are highly engaged with formulating a problem (Harada & Yoshina, 2004). According to Wale and Bishaw (2020), it is considered a beneficial pedagogical approach to enhancing learners’ academic writing since it engages learners in prewriting tasks by requiring them to generate ideas, clarify the writing topic, investigate information on the topic through numerous sources, explain their achievements during the exploration stage, and transfer their discoveries practically into the real world. Wale and Bogale (2021) also state that traditional methods of teaching writing is not as beneficial as inquiry-based learning in enhancing learners’ academic writing skill since the latter approach is inherently a discovery approach whereby learners are provided with the opportunity to produce their own academic writings independently.

In implementing inquiry-based learning in classrooms, there are however some obstacles, including time restrictions for doing activities, stimulating motivation, gathering and interpreting data, and following the phases of this approach (Kuhn et  al., 2000; Ucar & Trundle, 2011). Some researchers (Hwang et  al., 2012; Kuhn et  al., 2000; Ucar & Trundle, 2011) have indicated that integrating technology can be beneficial for overcoming some of these obstacles, resulting in positive impacts on the learning outcomes. For example, Arauz (2013) asserts that technology use in inquiry-based learning has a positive impact on both motivation and learners’ construction of knowledge. Ikpeze and Boyd (2007) also note that with the help of technology, inquiry-based learning can increase learners’ involvement in meaningful activities and reinforce their critical thinking skills.

There is a relatively small body of literature (e.g. Nabhan, 2017; Palupi et  al., 2020; Wale & Bogale, 2021) on the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning in the writing skill. For instance, Nabhan (2017) investigated the impact of integrating inquiry-based learning and ongoing assessment on French students’ essay writing skill. The participants were divided into the experimental and control groups, who were taught the same essay writing genres. While the experimental group was experiencing the integration of inquiry-based learning consisting of questioning, planning, investigating, reporting, and reflecting phases along with the ongoing assessment, the control group was taught through the conventional techniques. The results revealed that integrating ongoing assessment and the inquiry-based learning resulted in better scores and improvement in essay writing skills.

In a recent quasi-experimental study, Wale and Bogale (2021) also explored the impact of inquiry-based writing instruction on the EAP learners’ academic writing. The study was conducted with 62 first-year undergraduate Pharmacy students enrolled in the academic writing course. The participants were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received the inquiry-based writing instruction, while the control group received traditional method of teaching writing skill. The results revealed that the students in the experimental group outperformed those in the control group in producing the academic texts. Moreover, those in the experimental group produced better essays in terms of coherence, content, accuracy, grammatical and lexical range.

# Computer supported collaborative writing

Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), according to Stahl et  al. (2006), is the process of providing the new software and applications with the goal of bringing learners together and investigating how they learn together with the help of computer. It is argued that CSCL is a learner-centered approach, since it allows learners to take control over their own learning progress by enabling them to participate actively in constructing their knowledge (Hoppe et  al., 2007; Onrubia & Engel, 2009). Tsai (2019) also states that multiple enriched resources, various learning tasks, and increased learners’ interest are the advantages of incorporating the CSCL into language learning classes. In the same vein, Dooly and Sadler (2016) note that the CSCL provides learners with more leaning opportunities and rich resources.

Resta and Laferriere (2007) also state that CSCL is rooted strongly in a number of learning theories, which highlight the role of interaction, knowledge sharing, negotiation, and knowledge construction. According to Li (2018), with the help of Web 2.0 tools, including Wikis, blogs, and Google Docs which enhance engagement and collaboration at an unparalleled level, computer supported collaborative writing (CSCW) has gained significant attention in the second and foreign language learning contexts. A number of researchers (e.g. Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Hsieh, 2017; Lan et  al., 2015; Wang, 2015) have found that this approach can improve learners’ writing proficiency. Li (2018) defines CSCW as a collaborative writing activity performed online, where learners interact and construct meaning and then produce an online text through collaboration with others using technological tools. Blake (2008) also argues that with the help of synchronous and asynchronous collaborative learning environments, formal and informal writing tasks and peer feedback are provided, eliminating the boundaries of learners’ limitations in performing a writing task and changing their conceptions of collaborative writing. Furthermore, Dizon (2016) notes that by the integration of technology into writing classes, cooperation and collaboration are enhanced, leading to an interactive environment and writing skill improvement. Similarly, Goldberg et  al. (2003) state that when computers are employed in writing classrooms, a social environment is created in which learners can share their works with each other to receive feedback.

According to Hewitt and Scardamalia (1998), learners may not have much time to read and make comments on each other’s writings in face-to-face (F2F) classrooms, while the collaborative online environments do not restrict learners’ collaboration to the in-class communication. In addition, Baker (2009) states that by integrating technology into language classrooms, learners can make meaning and build new knowledge with their peers and instructor. Moreover, Bikowski and Vithanage (2016) note that CSCW is a new approach to language learning, which provides the opportunity for sharing information, constructing knowledge, and enhancing collaboration and interaction among students and between the instructor and students.

It is found that integrating CSCL in writing classes can improve the mechanics and syntactic elements of learners’ writing performance (Li, 2018), grammatical and lexical accuracy (Hsieh, 2017), content development (Kost, 2011), and meaning making skills (Aydin & Yildiz, 2014). Additionally, Kurt and Bensen (2017) state that the CSCL could enhance learners’ positive attitudes to writing classrooms. Moreover, Su and Zou (2020) recommend using the cloud-based tools, including Google Docs for more improvements in the CSCW-integrated classes. Wu et  al. (2019) also assert that the integration of online tools into flipped writing classrooms can foster learners’ performance in the macro and micro levels of writing, leading to more improvement in the learners’ idea organization, grammatical accuracy, and word choice. Dellatola et  al. (2020) investigated EFL learners’ engagement and writing skill by using the CSCL and inquiry-based language learning activities in a flipped classroom. The learners were divided into the experimental group following the CSCL and inquiry-based learning approaches in a flipped classroom, while the control group experienced only a collaborative approach in a traditional classroom. Findings revealed that the experimental group accomplished higher learning outcomes, particularly in grammar, fluency, and vocabulary range. In addition, learners’ behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional engagement was significantly improved in the experimental group compared to those in the control group.

Although, the above-reviewed research literature indicates that flipped classroom, inquiry-based learning, and CSCW are the effective pedagogical approaches to enhancing EFL learners’ academic writing, it points to the gap that the impact of integrating inquiry-based and flipped classroom has remained unexplored. It is hypothesized that the inquiry-based learning can compensate for the lack of sufficient support for outside the flipped classroom. It is also argued that the CSCL can provide instructors with great opportunities to present instructional materials and enhance learners’ collaboration with their peers to help them develop deeper knowledge of writing skill. Therefore, it is worth further investigating the impact of these approaches all together when they are integrated. There is also the lack of research on EAP learners’ perceptions of the impact of integrated and conventional flipped classrooms and collaborative writing platforms, including Google Docs and Edmodo. This study thus aimed to investigate the extent to which the integrated flipped classroom in a computer supported collaborative writing, conventional flipped classroom, and traditional non-flipped classroom could improve the writing performance of undergraduate students of railway engineering, their perceptions of the integrated and conventional flipped approaches, and their perceptions of Edmodo and Google Docs as the two platforms of learning writing. To this end, the following research questions were addressed.

1. To what extent do three models of instruction (i.e. traditional, conventional flipped, and integrated flipped) affect the writing performance of undergraduate students of railway engineering?   
2. What are learners’ perceptions of the integrated and conventional flipped classrooms?   
3. What are learners’ perceptions of Edmodo and Google Docs as the online platforms of learning writing?

# Methodology

# Context and participants

The study was conducted in the department of foreign languages at IUST, where engineering students were required to pass two English language courses. Detailed information about the content of these courses is provided in Taghizadeh and Saadatju (2021). The participants were 61 undergraduate students of railway engineering with the same first language (Persian), who were recruited based on the intact group procedures. They already passed the course of English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP) and were attending the course of English for Academic Purposes at the department of foreign languages to develop their knowledge of language for railway engineering. At the same time, in the railway engineering department, courses related to three sub-branches of track, transportation, and rolling stock were being offered to railway engineering students. To examine students’ homogeneity in terms of English language, Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency containing questions on reading, grammar, and vocabulary was administered to participants and the results indicated that their writing skills were at B1 level. It is worth noting that before university, they had studied English for 6 years in Iranian schools.

The participants were divided into three groups of a hybrid of flipped classroom and inquiry-based learning within a CSCL environment ${ \mathit { n } } = 2 1 { \mathit { \Omega } }$ ), conventional flipped group ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf n } = 2 0 ,$ , and the traditional non-flipped group $\left( n = 2 0 \right)$ . They were 40 $( 8 0 \% )$ male and 20 $( 2 0 \% )$ female students with their age ranged from 18 to 25 years. This research was conducted during the two semesters of the academic year 2019–2020 in which the first semester was allocated to instructing learners of the traditional and conventional groups in two separate classes for about 11 weeks, while the second semester was devoted to instructing learners in the integrated group for 11 weeks.

The second researcher was the instructor of the three groups, while the first researcher was the teacher assistant in this study and both provided students with instruction on academic writing.

# Data collection

The data collection instruments included Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency, a pretest and a posttest of writing, Writing Assessment Rubric, Edpuzzle, Bubble.us, Edmodo, Google Docs, a Learning Experience Questionnaire (LEQ), and the Technology Acceptance questionnaire (see Table 1). Two open-ended questions were also added to further investigate learners’ perceptions of the integrated instructional approach. As a pretest of writing, learners were asked to write a paragraph on describing local railway station. The purpose of the pretest was to determine the extent to which they were familiar with the descriptive paragraph and its requirements. To rate learners’ pre and posttests of writing, a writing assessment rubric with five criteria of grammar, fluency, cohesion, vocabulary range, and content was used by two expert raters. Inter-rater reliability was also conducted, indicating an acceptable consistency between the scores given by the raters $( r =$ .90). The full score for each of the five components was 9 points; hence, the minimum score that could be gained from the rubric was 0 point, while the maximum score was 45 points.

To upload the instructional videos before the class time, Edpuzzle was used, enabling instructors to create, edit, and crop the videos and to add comments and questions to produce an interactive video. It also allowed instructors to track the learners’ progress of watching the video and answering the questions. Buuble.us was also used to help learners write their paragraphs through planning, sharing their ideas, and creating colorful mind maps. Edmodo was another instrument used by the instructor to upload the instructional PowerPoint files before the class time. Learners were also required to post their mind maps created on Bubble.us, share their ideas, and give comments on their peers’ writing on Edmodo before coming to the class. Google Docs, a word processing and web-based application provided by Google, was also used as a platform for group writing tasks. It helped learners write their paragraphs, edit them simultaneously multiple times, and store them online.

LEQ consisted of 20 questions in a 5-point Likert scale developed by Haghighi et  al. (2018). It was administered to explore learning experience and perceptions of learners in the conventional and integrated flipped classrooms. This questionnaire consisted of six categories of motivation, usefulness, engagement, autonomy, anxiety, and satisfaction. To further investigate the perceptions of learners in the integrated flipped group about the two online platforms of Edmodo and Google Docs, two versions of the questionnaire on the technology acceptance developed by Davis et  al. (1989) was used. It included 16 items for each platform in a 5-point Likert scale with four categories, namely perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitudes to usage of the system, and behavioral intention.

# Procedure

Initially, language proficiency test was administered to homogenize the students. The pretest of writing was then administered and marked by two expert raters. In the treatment phase, six descriptive writing tasks on the history of railway development in Iran, rail production, UIC and its roles, how to keep animals out of track, and pros and cons of electrifying trains were performed. To differentiate instruction, railway engineering students were divided into three groups. The integrated flipped group received a hybrid of flipped classroom and inquiry-based learning within a CSCL environment; the other group received the conventional flipped instruction; and the third group experienced the traditional instruction with neither instructional videos nor technological tools. Using the inquiry model proposed by Pedaste et  al. (2015), the researchers initiated the instruction with the orientation phase before the class time, where learners’ curiosity was raised by watching the instructional videos on Edpuzzle and studying relevant PowerPoint files on Edmodo to gain more insights into the topic. Learners were then asked to generate hypotheses about the proposed topic by brainstorming, sharing their files and ideas with their peers on Edmodo, and then creating their own online mind maps through Bubbl.us. They were also asked to give feedback on their peers’ activities and write a descriptive paragraph on Google Docs using their mind maps and what they learnt from the collaboration with their classmates in the five-member groups. After that, they were requested to give comments on their group members’ writing tasks and receive feedback from the instructors and peers on their wittings.

Given the inquiry-based learning, in the orientation step, the emphasis was to arouse learners’ interest and curiosity through introducing them to the topic of writing. In the conceptualization step, the learners were asked to think of some relevant concepts to the topics as well as generate hypothesis by creating mind maps and sharing them with their peers to get more ideas for their writing. In the investigation step, the hypotheses were responded by taking the required actions. Experimentation and data interpretation were the two subcategories of this step in which the experimentation was defined as the process of designing and implementing a plan for writing the paragraphs. In other words, learners were asked to find texts, videos, and pictures related to the topic of writing, make annotations on their findings, and share them with their peers to receive feedback and to become familiar with their works. The next step was interpretation of data and making meaning from the collected date for which the learners were asked to write a descriptive paragraph on the suggested topic, using Google Docs. In the conclusion step, learners gave feedback to their peers’ writing, asked their questions, and revised their own writings (Figure 1).

In the conventional flipped classroom, however, neither the inquiry-based learning nor the CSCL environment was used. Learners were provided with the instructional videos on Edpuzzle, and the instructional materials were the same as those in the integrated group. Before coming to the class, they were asked to watch the videos, having the opportunity to take notes and review the videos at their own pace. Inside the class, they were asked to write a descriptive paragraph based on what they already learnt on a paper in five-member groups. They could also discuss about their misconceptions and receive feedback from the instructor on their writing tasks. In the traditional group, however, the instructor offered the same instruction as the other groups on how to write the descriptive paragraphs, and the learners were asked to write their paragraphs on the proposed topics in five-member groups. They were also required to give feedback on their group members’ writings. In general, all learners were asked to perform six writing tasks during the weeks of two to ten. For each writing task, 70 minutes were allocated; however, all groups had 30 minutes to write their paragraphs and the rest of 40 minutes were divided differently in each group. The detailed time allocation is provided in Figure 2.

At the end of the treatment, the learning experience questionnaire was administrated to learners of both integrated and conventional flipped classes to investigate their perceptions of the flipped classroom. Before administering the questionnaire, LEQ items were first translated into Persian and then checked in terms of form and content by experienced English-Persian translators. The reliability of the questionnaire was calculated, indicating the acceptable Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .93. Moreover, the technology acceptance questionnaire was adapted to probe into the perceptions of the learners in the integrated flipped group about using Edmodo and Google Docs. The items were then translated into Persian and were checked for form and content. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha was used to compute the reliability of the questionnaire, resulting in an internal consistency of .90 for the questionnaire on Edmodo and .93 for that on Google Docs. Finally, two open-ended questions were administered to the learners in the integrated flipped group to further explore their perceptions of this model (see Figures 2 and 3).

# Data analysis

Paired samples $t$ test was run to compare the pre and posttests of the integrated flipped, conventional flipped, and traditional non-flipped groups. In addition, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the learners’ pre and posttests of writing scores after receiving the instruction. To determine their perceptions of the two models of flipped classroom and the two online platforms, descriptive statistics were employed. Furthermore, to analyze the qualitative data, conventional content analysis was used. In other words, the most frequent patterns in the participants’ responses were identified and then analyzed quantitatively using percentages.

# Results

# Answer to research question 1: to what extent do three models of instruction (i.e. traditional, conventional flipped, and integrated flipped) affect the writing performance of undergraduate students of railway engineering?

The first research question investigated the impact of three instructional approaches on the descriptive writing performance of railway engineering students. Initially, the normality of learners’ pre and posttest scores was examined. Shapiro-Wilk statistic for both pre and posttests in all three groups was not significant $\left( p > . 0 5 \right)$ , indicating that the distribution of the scores was normal. Hence, a paired samples $t$ test was run to compare the impact of three approaches on the learners’ writing performance. The descriptive statistics of the three groups on the pre and posttests were computed, and the results are presented in Table 2.

As Table 2 indicates, learners in all three groups indicated improvement in their writing mean score from the pre to posttests. In other words, the mean gained in the posttests was greater than that of the pretests in all instructional models $\langle M _ { \mathrm { p r e } } = 2 3 . 7 5$ , 23.90, 23.57; $M _ { \mathrm { p o s t } } { = }$ 24.80, 28.55, 35.14). However, the scores were more heterogeneous in the posttests $\cdot S D _ { \mathrm { p r e } } { = 2 . 9 7 }$ , 3.02, 2.71; $S D _ { \mathrm { p o s t } } = 3 . 0 7$ , 3.22, 3.55). In order to determine whether these changes were statistically significant, the paired-samples $t$ test was conducted for each group. Results are provided in Table 3.

As Table 3 shows, there was a statistically significant difference in the writing performance of traditional group from the pretest to posttest, $t ( 1 9 ) = 4 . 7 0 2$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 0$ . The eta squared statistic (0.53) for this group indicated a large effect size. Table 3 also shows a statistically significant difference in the conventional flipped group from the pretest to posttest, $t ( 1 9 ) = 1 9 . 9 9 6$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ with the eta squared statistic of 0.95. Table 3 also shows that there was a statistically significant difference in the writing performance of the integrated flipped group from the pretest to posttest, $t ( 2 0 ) ~ = ~ 1 6 . 9 7 6$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 0$ . The eta squared statistic (0.93) for this group indicated a large effect size. The results highlighted that the integrated, conventional, and traditional non-flipped instruction was effective in improving the railway engineering students’ descriptive writing skills.

To compare the three groups’ performance on the pretest of writing, ANOVA was conducted. The results revealed no significant difference in the pretest scores of the three groups: $F ( 2 , 5 8 0 ) = . 0 6$ , $ { p }  { = }  { \mathrm { ~ \ . 9 3 ~ } }$ , indicating that all learners showed similar performance on the descriptive writing task. The results also revealed that there was not any significant difference among the three groups in their scores for the components of fluency, grammar, cohesion, content, and vocabulary range. In addition, to compare their performance in the posttest of writing, one-way ANOVA was employed, and the statistically significant differences were found in the posttest mean scores for the three groups: $F ( 2 , \ 5 8 ) \ =$ 52.031, $p = . 0 0 0$ with the large effect size of .64. To exactly determine the differences among the groups, the post-hoc test was used. The result of this test is provided in Table 4.

Given the Tukey HSD test, the post-hoc comparisons showed that the mean score for the traditional group $\mathit { M } = 2 4 . 8 0$ , $S D = 3 . 0 7 1$ ) was significantly different from that of the conventional flipped group ( $M = 2 8 . 5 5$ , $S D = 3 . 2 2 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and the integrated flipped group $( M = 3 5 . 1 4 $ , $S D = 3 . 5 5 4 ) $ ). The mean score for the conventional flipped group was also significantly different from that of the integrated flipped group, indicating that the significant differences were found across all three groups, and that learners in the integrated flipped classroom achieved the highest mean scores and significantly outperformed those in the other groups. With regard to aspects of writing, there was statistically significant difference among the three groups in grammar and fluency $( p < . 0 5 )$ , indicating that grammar and fluency could be improved more through the integrated flipped model.

# Answer to research question 2: what are learners’ perceptions of the integrated and conventional flipped classrooms?

Learners’ perceptions of the conventional and integrated flipped classrooms were investigated by administering the learning experience questionnaire. The median and percentage of learners’ responses to the options of each item were calculated. In the integrated flipped classroom, all 20 items on the learners’ perceptions of the flipped instruction received the same median (Median $= 4 \dot { }$ ), whereas in the conventional flipped classroom only 13 items received this median. The results revealed that compared to the conventional group, learners in the integrated flipped classroom showed more positive perceptions and motivation for learning writing skill as they felt less fear and tension due to their prior preparation. They also held the opinion that this method was more engaging than the conventional instruction, had more opportunities to communicate with their classmates, participated in the class activities more than before, made more effort, and spent more time than usual. The questionnaire was classified into the categories of autonomy, usefulness, engagement, motivation, satisfaction, and anxiety and the descriptive statistics of the two groups on these categories were computed and the results are presented in Table 5.

As indicated in Table 5, in the conventional flipped group, the highest mean score was obtained by satisfaction $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 3 . 7 1 \mathbf { \mathit { \Omega } }$ ), closely followed by usefulness $\stackrel { \prime } { M } = 3 . 6 6 )$ and autonomy $\mathrm { \mathit { M } } = 3 . 6 6 \mathrm { \mathit { \Omega } }$ ), while that in the integrated flipped group was achieved by autonomy $\mathit { M } = 4 . 1 1 $ ), followed by anxiety $\left( M = 4 . 0 4 \right)$ and usefulness $( M = 4 . 0 0 )$ ). However, the lowest mean score in the conventional flipped group was related to engagement ( $\mathit { M } = 3 . 0 2 $ ), whereas in the integrated flipped group, it belonged to motivation $\cdot M { = } 3 . 8 4 )$ . An independent samples $t$ test was performed to compare the mean scores for subscales of learning experience questionnaire, and the results revealed significant differences in the mean scores for the usefulness in the conventional flipped group $\stackrel { \prime } { M } = 3 . 6 6$ , $S D =$ .60) and that in the integrated flipped group $( M = 4 . 0 0$ , $S D = . 4 1$ ; t(39) $= 2 . 0 7$ , $ { p } = . 0 4 )$ ; engagement in the conventional flipped group $\scriptstyle \cdot M = 3 . 0 2$ , $S D { = } 1 . 1 1 )$ and that in the integrated flipped group $\mathrm { \prime } M = 3 . 9 6$ , $S D = . 5 3$ ; $t ( 2 6 . 8 9 ) ~ = ~ 3 . 4 0 $ , $ { p } = \ . 0 0 )$ ; anxiety in the conventional flipped group ( $\cdot M { = } 3 . 3 0$ , $S D = . 8 6 )$ and that in the integrated flipped group $( M = 4 . 0 4$ , $S D = . 5 8$ ; $t ( 3 3 . 3 4 ) = 3 . 2 2$ , $p = . 0 0 )$ . Furthermore, two open-ended questions were only administrated to learners in the integrated flipped group $\left( n = 2 1 \right)$ to further explore their perceptions of this type of instruction. Their responses to the first question about the pros and cons of the integrated flipped classroom are provided in Table 6.

However, learners suggested two disadvantages for this method, which are presented in Table 7.

Considering the second open-ended question on students’ favorite experience with the integrated flipped instruction, their preferences are provided in Table 8.

# Answer to research question 3: what are learners’ perceptions of edmodo and google docs as the online platforms of learning writing?

The last research question explored the perceptions of the learners in the integrated flipped group about the two online platforms of writing. Accordingly, the questionnaire on the technology acceptance consisting of four categories of attitude towards use, perceived usefulness, behavioral intention, and perceived ease of use was employed. Regarding the items of the questionnaire on Edmodo, learners found using Edmodo for class activities easy and not time-consuming. They also held the view that Edmodo provided clear guidance about the activities, the comments and feedback it provided were useful, and it could improve the quality and appropriateness of their writing. Considering their perceptions of Google Docs, all items received the same median (Median $= 4 )$ ). In other words, they found using the Google Docs for class activities useful, convenient, time-saving, and stress-free. They also had positive attitudes to using Google Docs as learning Google Docs for writing activities was an easy task; and it improved their willingness to use it to learn, write, and post their messages in English in future. They also held the view that the comments and feedback received via Google Docs were useful for improving their writing skill. In order to explore their perceptions of Edmodo and Google Docs in terms of the four categories of the questionnaire, descriptive statistics were calculated, and the results are presented in Table 9.

As Table 9 highlights, the highest mean score for Edmodo belonged to perceived ease of use $\langle M = 3 . 3 5 )$ , while the lowest one was obtained by behavioral intention $\ M = 3 . 0 9 )$ ). Table 9 also shows that regarding learners’ views of Google Docs, the highest mean was related to behavioral intention $( M = 3 . 9 8 )$ , closely followed by perceived ease of use $\langle M = 3 . 9 5 )$ , while the lowest one was obtained by attitude toward use $\langle M = 3 . 7 7 \rangle$ .

# Discussions

The results revealed that even though the three approaches could enhance learners’ descriptive writing, the integrated flipped model resulted in better learning outcomes. It is argued that the factors contributing to writing improvement of the integrated and conventional flipped groups over the traditional non-flipped one include the time spent and preparation made before the class, availability of the instructional materials before the class, and better use of in-class time. These results are in line with those of Amiryousefi (2017), Chen Hsieh et  al. (2017), and Egbert et  al. (2015), indicating that flipped classroom could provide flexible instructional time, offer more efficient time inside the class and for practice, and allow learners to learn without any time limitations, which is very important when it comes to EFL contexts, where learners have the opportunity to practice language only during the class time.

Another explanation for the improvement in the integrated group’s descriptive writing skill might be that by using the inquiry-based learning, learners are provided with ample authentic materials, participation, and collaboration, enhancing the opportunity to use language more collaboratively through scaffolding each other for improving their writing performance. This is broadly supported by the finding of Justice et  al. (2007) who highlighted the role of inquiry-based learning in the development of collaborative learning skills and written communication. The results also support those of Arauz (2013), Danker (2015), Lee (2014), and Zafra-Gómez et  al. (2014) who indicated that integrating inquiry-based learning into language teaching could promote learners’ academic performance and learning outcomes. More specifically, the findings confirmed those of Nabhan (2017) and Palupi et  al. (2020) who found that the inquiry-based learning approach had a positive impact on learners’ writing skills.

The findings revealed that the components of grammar and fluency were improved more through inquiry-based flipped model. This improvement may be due to watching instructional videos and receiving feedback on their writing tasks form their peers and instructors. The findings are similar to those of Wu et  al. who reported writing improvement in grammatical use in a flipped writing class in which online tools were used. Webb and Doman (2016) also found that flipped writing class could improve learners’ grammatical knowledge. Wale and Bogale (2021) similarly reported that EAP learners could produce better texts in terms of grammar in an inquiry-based writing class.

Learners acknowledged that the integrated flipped model was more useful, engaging, and less anxiety-provoking. This might be due to the fact that the integration of inquiry-based learning and CSCL into a flipped classroom requires students to have a more active role before and inside the class, conduct research projects, and work together on learning activities. In addition, their feeling of less anxiety might be due to more pre-class preparation in the flipped instruction. The findings corroborate those of previous studies (Ekmekci, 2017; Haghighi et  al., 2018; Lee & Wallace, 2017), indicating learners’ positive attitudes to flipped classroom. Moreover, the findings also align with Zainuddin and Attaran (2016) who showed that most higher education students had more positive perceptions of flipped classroom and tended to register in more classes offering this model. Furthermore, the positive attitudinal findings about the integrated flipped model overlap those of Danker (2015) and Zafra-Gómez et  al. (2014) who found that following the inquiry-based approach, learners became more engaged in the learning procedure. Additionally, these findings support Dooly’s (2007) and Hurd’s (2007) results, emphasizing that incorporating the CSCL in learning programs could reduce learners’ anxiety, enhance their confidence, and encourage them to engage in the active learning.

Regarding learners’ perceptions of the integrated flipped classroom, responses to the open-ended questions indicated that they found that this class could enhance their self-regulatory skills, provide a supportive learning environment with multiple sources, improve their topic-specific knowledge, and promote the collaborative learning with a high degree of flexibility. Their views may be based on the fact that the inquiry-based learning is a student-centered approach, encouraging learners to conduct research and get engaged in searching activities to acquire knowledge, which results in higher self-regulatory skills. This finding lends support to much of the literature, highlighting that inquiry-based learning is an efficient pedagogical approach to developing learners’ self-directed skills and making learning more meaningful (Benson & Bruce, 2001; Hwang et  al., 2012; Lim, 2004; Oliver, 2008) and enhancing learners’ active participation (Arauz, 2013). Moreover, the results substantiate those of Zafra-Gómez et  al. (2014) who found that with the help of inquiry-based learning, learners could achieve the increased knowledge of the subject. Results also showed that the CSCL provides supportive learning tools, such as videos, web pages, articles, or technological tools in Google Docs, Wikis, or Edmodo to promote collaboration to solve their problems in groups with the help of technology. This result is in line with that of Kreijns et  al. (2003) who indicated that the vital role of CSCL was to provide an environment, promoting collaboration among learners to boost their learning process. Additionally, the results confirmed those of Jeong et  al. (2014) who found that the CSCL could provide a supportive and flexible environment in F2F, online, or blended classes.

Given the challenges learners encountered in the integrated flipped classroom, it was highlighted that their concerns were mostly related to time and high degree of workload. Their concerns may refer to the fact that this model required a high degree of engagement before and inside the class. In addition, there were some research activities before the class, resulting in the extra workload for learners. These findings are in line with those of Wanner and Palmer (2015) who reported that one important challenge of flipped classroom was the required time for implementing this approach due to provision of appropriate materials and designing in-class and out-class activities. This study also yielded similar results with those of Kuhn et  al. (2000), Lee and Butler (2003), and Ucar and Trundle (2011) who stated that applying the learning activities, fostering learners’ motivation, gathering and interpreting data, and following the phases of inquiry-based learning could cause time restrictions.

Moreover, the finding revealed that using Edmodo and Google Docs could improve students’ writing skill. This may partly be explained by the fact that Edmodo and Google Docs are the appropriate tools in creating effective, engaging, and convenient environments for discussion, sharing, interaction, and doing assignments. This finding is in line with that of Abrams (2016), Bikowski and Vithanage (2016), and Chu et  al. (2017) who found that learners experiencing the computer-supported collaborative tools produced the higher-quality writings. This finding is also in agreement with that of Dellatola et  al. (2020) who indicated that using collaborative, inquiry-based writing activities in a flipped classroom resulted in writing skill enhancement, particularly in terms of vocabulary range, grammar, and fluency.

# Limitations and implications

Considering limitations of this study, apart from lack of time and access to smart devices, the small sample size in each group was another shortcoming, which was due to the policies of the department to limit the students of the EAP classes for their better achievement. Other data collection instruments, including interview and group discussions could have also been used to get more insight into the pedagogical potentials of the approaches and the platforms used in this study. The instructors of this study could have also been interviewed to investigate their perceptions and challenges of the experiment.

It is argued that the EAP instructors need to take time to reconsider their methods of teaching and integrate technology and innovative methods into their instruction to meet the instructional needs of their students. They are also recommended to use the technological tools, including Edmodo and Google Docs to enhance collaborative learning in the EAP classes to present learners with the instructional materials before the class and to provide them with authentic and collaborative learning activities. It is also highly recommended that they implement the inquiry-based learning approach in their writing classes to engage learners in searching, gathering, analyzing, idea creation, and problem solving through collaboration with peers, which can end up in their academic writing improvement.

However, one important tip for instructors who are willing to change their methods from the lecture-based instruction to the flipped one is that they should take time and put careful thought on how to implement the flipped instruction, as it may put extra time and workload on learners and instructors. In addition, they need to adequately guide learners through the stages of flipped classroom, particularly before the class by implementing the inquiry-based learning and peer collaboration. Materials and curriculum developers can also redesign and apply the appropriate materials, tasks, and activities for the EAP classes. For example, they can use collaborative online tools and inquiry-based instruction to improve learners’ academic writing skill. Policy makers also need to select and design more efficient training programs for language teachers and develop effective materials and pedagogical approaches for language learners.

# Conclusions

This study was conducted to offer an integrated approach, combining the inquiry-based learning with the flipped classroom within a computer supported collaborative learning with the purpose of investigating Engineering students’ writing skills development and perceptions of flipped classroom, Edmodo and Google Docs for improving writing performance. The results revealed that learners’ writing performance in all three groups was improved. However, the impact of integrated flipped model on descriptive writing skills was greater than that of the traditional and conventional flipped instruction, particularly in terms of grammar and fluency. The results also showed that both flipped models were useful, satisfactory, engaging, and motivating; enhanced learners’ autonomy; and reduced their anxiety. Nevertheless, it was proved that the integrated flipped model was significantly more useful and effective in reducing learners’ anxiety. In addition, learners held the view that this model could provide multiple sources and improve content knowledge and self-regulation skills. It also provided a collaborative learning environment with a high degree of flexibility for self-paced learning outside the class. Learners also reported that this model provided a better use of class time and emphasized its effectiveness in engaging them, as they were no longer passive recipients of knowledge. Although their preference for using the Google Docs outweighed Edmodo, using both of these platforms was found effective in creating a convenient environment for pre- and in-class activities, discussion, teamwork, sharing, commenting, evaluation, and interaction among learners. It can be concluded that the integrated flipped model can be more effective in improving engineering students’ descriptive writing skills.

The contribution of inquiry-based learning to flipped classroom was that this approach could engage learners in the process of learning writing and enhance their self-regulation by implementing various phases of inquiry. This approach could also improve learners’ knowledge of issues related to their discipline by requiring them to search about the topic through finding various sources and sharing them with their peers. In addition, the online tools showed positive effects on promoting collaboration among learners, as through using Edmodo, learners could share their views and instructional materials with their classmates, resulting in the promotion of their learning and interaction with their classmates. Google Docs was also found to be an effective online platform for improving the writing skill by providing learners with the opportunity to give comments, evaluate, and revise their classmates’ writings.

More research is required to investigate the advantages and challenges of flipped instruction, its use in various courses, and its impact on learners’ satisfaction, confidence, self-regulation, engagement, motivation, and attitudes. In addition, it is critical to conduct more research on the flipped model in various EAP courses to explore whether this model could also be effective for other disciplines. Future researchers can also determine the impact of integrated flipped model on the development of other language skills and components. Further research can also explore the effect of flipped model on other genres of writing, including process, comparison/contrast, and problem/solution. Another study can probe into the effect of technological devices and online platforms on English language learners’ writing performance.
