Recent studies from sociocultural perspectives have explored the effects of Concept-based Language Instruction (C-BLI) on L2 development through the explicit teaching of scientific concepts. However, there has been little research into the effects of C-BLI on the development of L2 academic literacy. This article reports on a case study of how C-BLI mediated a Chinese doctoral student's development of conceptual knowledge of context and subsequent context-specific performance in academic writing. Drawing on data from writing tutorials and interviews, the learner's drafts and invited comments, and think-aloud protocols, the study revealed that the C-BLI interventions that integrated symbolic and dialogic mediation helped the learner attain and enhance awareness of contextual components. The learner appropriated the concept as a tool for thinking in judging appropriateness of rules of thumb and choices of exclusive discourse features in specific contexts of use, which consequently mediated his planning for writing and resulted in the development of performance. The study demonstrates the potential of C-BLI as a driving force for the development of conceptual knowledge and context-specific performance in the academic literacy of L2 learners. It has pedagogical implications for curriculum design, C-BLIinformed literacy and concept-based materials, and teacher development to stimulate teacher awareness in C-BLI.

# 1. Introduction

Academic writing across disciplines has been documented as a major difficulty for learners of English as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) at the tertiary level (Cheng, 2016; Hyland, 2006; Hyland & Shaw, 2016), particularly for graduate students writing for publication in specialist journals (Cargill, Gao, Wang, & O’Connor, 2018; Castello, I  nesta, \~ & Corcelles, 2013; Huang, 2014). Difficulties mainly arise from students’ limited grasp and use of some “conceptual tools” needed for successful writing (Lei & Hu, 2019, p. 73), including English language skills, conventions in relation to writing and publishing, knowledge for presenting new findings in research, and skills for disciplinary knowledge construction in writing. Notwithstanding these difficulties, mainstream L2 writing pedagogy treats academic literacy as a set of discrete, value-free rules of language and technical skills universally applicable in any situation, putting students at risk of underachievement in successful communication in international disciplinary contexts (Hyland & Shaw, 2016). Swales (2019) suggests utilizing methods to describe and explain “how academic discourses take the shapes that they do, and how we might assist students in mastering these discourses” (p.81). This proposal aligns with the call for an effective writing pedagogy with an explicit focus on teaching features of academic language, how the features work to create meaning in texts in relation to specific contexts, and strategies for promoting literacy engagement and identity affirmation (Cummins, 2014).

According to sociocultural theory (SCT), human mental development in higher forms largely lies within the sociocultural domain (Vygotsky, 1978). When extended to formal education, the sociocultural domain is the primary source and principal driver of mental development (van Compernolle, 2014). This type of formal education entails promoting “artificial development” of the individual through the intentional and systematic organization of scientifically grounded conceptual knowledge (Vygotsky, 1997, p. 88), which helps restructure what the person learns through everyday experiences. Different from everyday empirical concepts that the learner acquires based on an observable property of things (Kozulin, 1995), either in everyday ordinary life or in educational contexts, scientific concepts are not empirical instantiations, but entail abstract understanding that includes all (or most) possible instantiations. They represent the generalization of human experience. Despite the high relevance of scientific concepts to substantial human development, this type of knowledge is generally unavailable in everyday life but is optimally afforded in educational settings (Lantolf & Zhang, 2017). These sociocultural perspectives on the role of scientific conceptual knowledge in the field of second language acquisition (SLA) and language teaching have inspired Concept-based Language Instruction (C-BLI) (Lantolf, Xi, & Minakova, 2020). Concomitantly, C-BLI of L2 academic writing has the objective to promote adult learners’ high-order mental development through explicit teaching of scientific concepts (Paradis, 2009) that are connected to practical activity. During their context-specific writing activities, learners “not only internalize the conceptual knowledge but also come to understand how they can deploy the knowledge to meet their own goals” (Lantolf & Zhang, 2017, p. 149).

The study profiled in this paper originated from a larger study that sought to develop L2 academic literacy through C-BLI within a sociocultural framework for academic writing. Academic literacy in this study refers to learners' competence to understand and use a variety of discourse features to engage in meaningful and purposeful yet discipline-varied communication. As cognitive processing at the discourse level involves basic language skills (Vangara, 2017), the teaching paradigm centers on assisting learners in composing texts at the discourse level. Academic discourse, therefore, serves as the leading concept in framing the pedagogy. Three subconcepts are conceptualized from three interrelated aspects that illustrate how learners draw on empirical rules and conventions for creating meanings (e.g., formality, context of use, identity construction): 1. linguistic resources for formality d knowledge about linguistic resources to be used for academic purposes; 2. context or contextual components d a clear perception of what to employ as appropriate for context of use; and 3. relation or relational parameters d strategic self-presentation employed when one relates oneself properly to a special discourse community due to one's own status. These subconcepts serve to guide learners through a quasi-investigation (Davydov, 2004) of the leading concept. As successful academic writing means projecting “a shared context” (Hyland, 2006, p. 40), context is considered to be a primary component of academic discourse. Context entails the use of some discourse features in writing relating to the established conventions of a discourse community (e.g., a disciplinary community, the community of a particular journal). These features usually include but are not confined to the established global article organization, strategies for knowledge construction in articles from various disciplines, the move structure of each article part, prescribed formatting and mechanics, and conformity to unwritten but well-received rules of writing. Drawing on data from a longitudinal case study, this article presents the development of conceptual knowledge of context of a Chinese doctoral student, who participated in C-BLI tutorials for instructed academic writing. This study aims at assisting learners to look beyond a set of discrete, value-free rules of thumb and technical skills, and to develop awareness and knowledge of holistic theoretical concepts, which can then serve as an orienting basis for the use of particular language forms and features (Gal'perin, 1992).

# 2. A sociocultural approach to academic writing

# 2.1. Writing as a mediated activity

The mediated mind is a central tenet of SCT on developmental education, because higher-order mental development is achieved most essentially in thinking and communicative activity that are mediated by socially and culturally constructed means (Vygotsky, 1978). Writing is not a final product (Markova, 1992  ) but a process of activity entailed by the motive to achieve an object defined as “problem space” (Engestrom, 1993 € , p. 67) d for example, to compose a research article in English for publication in an SCI/SSCI-indexed journal1 or equivalent. Meanwhile, as writing serves communicative intentionsd for example, to present new research findings, to construct new disciplinary knowledge, or even to promote the writers’ position in academia, academic writing for publication is also a socially networked activity (Lei & Hu, 2019). The attainment of the object is never a one-off production, but the result of a reciprocating process between thinking (orientation) and writing performance (execution) in the activity. When writing performance is constantly enhanced until a desirable article is composed with the help of physical and symbolic, external and internal tools (Lantolf & Thorne, 2006), the object is attained and then molded or transformed into “outcome” (Engestrom, 1993€ , p. 67) d academic-literacy development. Within this object-directed activity, learners create meanings in discourse for their communicative purposes. The meanings are not referential ones prescribed in language forms, but new meanings or “meaning potential” emergent in dialogic activity (Lantolf & Thorne, 2006, p. 9). The meanings, which are better represented and categorized as conceptual knowledge, mediate thinking and help learners plan the use of discourse features in their writing activity (orientation) before acting (execution). Thus, the pedagogical interventions in this study center on mapping meanings onto features, which is the reverse of traditional practices in instructed SLA in general (van Compernolle, 2013) and L2 writing instruction in particular, which teach learners how to map acquired features onto meanings.

On this basis, one of the central tenets of the current framework is that academic-literacy learning and development is mediated by a dialectical unity achieved via proper instruction in internalizing conceptual knowledge (Mansouri & Mantero, 2020). The rationale for the framework is that the mediated development is afforded by the C-BLI interventions that involve the visual/material presentation of language concepts provided to learners as “a meaningful whole” (Haenen, 2001, p. 162) (i.e., the schema for a complete orienting basis of action, SCOBA, Gal'perin, 1989, to be elaborated in the later section), organized practical activity whereby learners link the conceptual categories to their use, and dialogic interaction with the instructor, who assumes responsibility for formulating the aforementioned two types of instructional activities. Hence, learners can incorporate those meaning-based mediational tools into their cognition, develop a systematic basis for using language, and use written language with greater flexibility across a wide array of contexts. Fig. 1 illustrates how pedagogical interventions fuel writing as a mediated activity.

# 2.2. Conceptual knowledge and concept-based Language Instruction

Another central tenet of the current framework is the development of conceptual knowledge of academic literacy. As a largely conceptual process (Negueruela, 2008), L2 development is about more than acquiring language features and rules of thumb that are valid for all instantiations. Instead, it entails “acquiring new conceptual knowledge and/or modifying already existing knowledge as a way of re-mediating one's interaction with the world and with one's own psychological functioning” (Lantolf & Thorne, 2006, p. 5). Although concept-based pedagogies are inspired by Vygotsky's proposal that scientific concepts should be the focal component of educational development, it was Vygotsky's student Gal'perin who formulated the approach known as Systemic Theoretical Instruction (STI) which has been particularly influential in establishing the phases implemented in C-BLI (Lantolf et al., 2020). C-BLI is grounded in three principles d language concepts as coherent and theoretical units of instruction, concept materialization and verbalization (Mansouri & Mantero, 2020). The instructional units entail holistic explanation of abstract scientific knowledge which is understandable and facilitates the orienting function for learners' action. It is made possible through the materialization of concepts, the visual, graphic representations (e.g., pedagogical diagrams), best captured in Gal'perin's (1989) proposal for the schema for a complete orienting basis of action (SCOBA). As an external form of mediation, a SCOBA assists learners in gaining control over verbalizing conceptual knowledge as they engage in communicative activities, until they can gradually appropriate the concepts to regulate their performance. Accordingly, C-BLI follows the six phases of Gal'perin's STI model, namely orientation to generate preunderstanding, a high-quality explanation of the concept, materialization in the form of SCOBA, communicative activities, verbalization, and concept internalization (see Lantolf et al., 2020; Lantolf & Zhang, 2017).

Recent L2 research from sociocultural perspectives has explored the effectiveness of C-BLI. Empirical studies have investigated different aspects of L2 pedagogy, such as the teaching of grammatical features for the development of grammar competence (Negueruela, 2003; Serrano-Lopez  & Poehner, 2008; Swain, Lapkin, Knouzi, Suzuki, & Brooks, 2009; Ganem-  Gutierrez  & Harun, 2011; Zhang & Lantolf, 2015; Johnson & Lyddon, 2016; García, 2017; Tsai, 2020), pragmatic and sociopragmatic development through instructional pragmatics (Henery, 2015; Ohta, 2017; van Compernolle, 2013; van Compernolle & Henery, 2014; van Compernolle, Webber, & Gomez-Laich, 2016), and the instruction-mediated L2 development of language skills and competence (e.g., writing) (Ferreira, 2005; Fogal, 2015; Kao, 2017). These studies have mostly taken advantage of ready-made concepts about the language under study, investigating how meanings are created through context-specific linguistic practices that are mediated in the presence of the SCOBA during pedagogical interventions.

# 2.3. Concepts appropriation in academic writing instruction

Academic writing is the object-directed collective (i.e., socially networked) activity that is mediated both by the corresponding instruction and the relevant scientific concepts, among which academic discourse is the most significant. Lillis (2001) argued that academic literacy practiced through academic discourse is an institutionalized reference to a distinct way of constructing knowledge within established academic communities. In the discourse practices (i.e., the communicative activities of writing or speaking), an individual gradually gains control of knowledge about how to compose communityaccepted discourse; this is referred to by literacy theorists as “a schema” (Hyland, 2006, p. 42), which functions to orient the individual's participation. Academic discourse, therefore, serves a powerful mediational role in the development of academic literacy in an L2. The determination of the subconcepts which facilitate the quasi-investigation of academic discourse is subject to three factors: their relevance to meaning-making with particular discourse features, their abstractness that allows them to encompass the majority of possible instances of these features, and the feasibility of materializing them as SCOBAs. The C-BLI that centers on the above-mentioned concept and subconcepts is designed to provide mediating interventions to move learner-writers through object-directed discursive activities that involve the community, the rules and the division of labor (Engestrom, 1999 € ), resulting in the learners' incorporation of these cultural tools, appropriation of the new concepts and self-regulation in their writing performance.

There have only been a few C-BLI investigations of the development of ESL learners' literacy, among which Ferreira (2005) and Fogal (2015) are the two most important studies that endorse C-BLI-driven knowledge construction and competence in writing. Ferreira investigated how students appropriated genre-based awareness to guide the process of meaning-making and problem-solving when writing three types of texts, i.e., announcements, cover letters and argumentations. Fogal examined the influence of C-BLI-mediated construction of authorial voice in high-stakes essay writing and found that the pedagogical endeavours promoted the learners’ overall writing quality. Hence, based on the promise of C-BLI in L2 writing, this study tries to extend this line of inquiry to explore how L2 competence at the discourse level is transformed via mediated interventions that integrate symbolic mediation (i.e., SCOBAs) and dialogic mediation leading to the internalization of new concepts (Poehner & Infante, 2019).

This study was guided by the following questions:

(1) How did C-BLI help the learner foster conceptual understanding of academic discourse features? (2) How did C-BLI help the learner develop his performance in academic writing?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Context

The present article draws on data collected from a larger study which incorporates concept-based tutorials and off-tutorial activities with the focus on developing the conceptual knowledge of discourse features and the academic literacy of ESL graduate students in China. Three students voluntarily participated in the program. All participants followed the same schedule of tasks and activities to promote their research article writing over a period of seven weekly sessions which integrated the six phases of Gal'perin's STI model. The sessions were conducted one-on-one with a Chinese teacher of English who is also one of the researchers. As is noted in the Introduction, the present focus concerns only conceptual knowledge of context through the synergic effect of SCOBAs and dialogical mediation. To this end, we follow a case study approach focused on one learner in the study, CP (a pseudonym). The idea underpinning this case study research is using “the peculiarities” of the single case to “illuminate the phenomenon and magnify the understanding of the research topic” (Roller & Lavrakas, 2015, p. 296). It enables us to offer “an in-depth examination” (Poehner & Infante, 2019, p. 5) of the mediated learning process leading to the mediated L2 development of academic literacy in the learner through these peculiarities.

The whole program was divided into three stages. The first stage included a diagnostic profile and the reading of sample research articles. The diagnostic profile included a biodata questionnaire for investigating the learner’ educational experience in academic literacy and scholarly writing, and a pre-tutorial discourse awareness interview (DAI) that sought to diagnose learner knowledge of the three subconcepts, i.e., linguistic resources, context, and relation. The second stage included the tutorials proper from Session 2 to 6 and off-tutorial tasks. The tutorials involved a sequence of tasks through tutor-learner dialogue dealing with concept extraction from materials reading (extraction of linguistic resources in Session 2, context and relation in Session 3), presentation of SCOBAs (Session 4), review of (sub)concepts and the co-reviewing of article drafts and revisions. The dialogical mediation during the joint review and revision process aimed at promoting symbolic tool use through modeling its relevance and reflecting on choices of discourse features in the writing drafts (Poehner & Infante, 2019). Meanwhile, the learner was asked to explain his understanding and appropriation of the subconcepts in relation to his writing orientation and execution, and also required to “think aloud” his reflections when left alone in the room. The offtutorial tasks included reading relevant materials, and revising drafts. The final stage included a post-tutorial DAI parallel to the pre-tutorial DAI to determine learner conceptual understanding after the interventions. Both L1 and L2 were allowed in dialogues, think-aloud protocols and interviews in order to facilitate understanding and internalization of abstract (sub) concepts. The tutor also switched between L1 and L2 in light of learner response.

# 3.2. Participant

CP was a Ph.D. candidate in aeronautical and astronautical science and technology at a major university in mainland China, and was required to publish research articles in SCI-indexed journals or equivalent. CP was an English learner of (upper-) intermediate level, in that he had passed College English Text Band 6, a national standardized test. This guaranteed that the research focus could be on learners’ discourse awareness and conceptual knowledge, without the need to teach the grammar of concrete and discrete linguistic forms and structures. Additionally, CP had an immediate plan for research article submission, writing a research paper for international publication, therefore served as the definite object of his academic writing activity. This ensured that the SCOBAs used in the tutorials were relatively stable, because tools should be functional and available for appropriation only in the activity in which they play a mediating role (Kozulin, 2003).

# 3.3. Materials

The C-BLI materials included five pedagogical diagrams and accompanying explanation cards, fifteen sample research articles and a pre-study report on their discourse features, and handouts of chapters concerning the target aspects from academic writing textbooks, all in English. Among these materials, one diagram depicting the subconcept of context/ contextual components (Fig. 2) and the explanation cards of discourse features under it were of particular relevance to the present study. This diagram is designed to visualize the conceptualization of academic writing for publication as a contextualized activity. The holistic image is intended to enhance memory and prompt application of the relevant information in the practical activity, such as English academic writing conventions, academic or disciplinary community and its support and contribution to writing, and discourse features (e.g., established global organization/structure, move structure, APA format). The explanation cards focus on context and conventions, research article structure, move structure, and discourse circuit.

# 3.4. Data collection and analysis

The data of CP was collected from two semi-structured interviews (about $2 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ ), five weekly C-BLI tutorial sessions ( $1 5 \mathrm { h }$ in total, each session lasting for about 3 h), off-tutorial tasks, different drafts and invited comments from his supervisor or fellow students. The tutor-learner dialogue and the learner's think-aloud protocols in tutorials, as well as interviews, were videoand audio-recorded in a reserved research site. All protocols were transcribed and annotated (see Transcription Conventions in Appendix). The transcription and translation of Chinese into English were conducted by the two authors. For the focus in this paper, the selected data only included source information concerning the subconcept of context from CP's data set.

The data were analyzed through “detailed study of small phenomena” in the learner's cognition and writings (Sacks, 1984, p.24). Particularly, verbalized protocols were analyzed through microgenesis, which was deployed both as “the methodological tool to investigate learning instances as observed in short periods of time” and as “the object of study” observed from those language learning instances (Gutierrez, 2008  , p. 120), in order to reveal the origins and processes of development. To wit, the construct of microgenesis allows for fine-grained examination of the mental activity of knowledge construction in relation to meaning, discourse features and rhetorical functions. When the “moment-by-moment analyses of discourse”

Fig. 2. Pedagogical diagram depicting contextual components.

(Wertsch, 1985, p. 262) are mapped onto the learner's writings, the construct also enables investigation into any development of writing performance in context-specific use.

# 4. Findings and discussion

This section presents findings arranged in light of the two research questions.

4.1. RQ1: how did C-BLI help the learner foster conceptual understanding of academic discourse features?

CP's responses to pre- and post-tutorial DAIs respectively shed light on his prior understanding of academic discourse context and subsequent changes in his knowledge. His prior context-related understanding was limited to everyday concepts in the form of some rules and skills of written discourse, as he could only list some instances of discourse features without clear perceptions of when and where to apply them. The C-BLI treatment then played a role in the “stage-by-stage formation” (Gal’perin, 1992, p.60) of conceptual knowledge in CP. Therefore, after the tutorials he demonstrated some systematic conceptual knowledge that would orient his plan for writing actions.

# 4.1.1. Rule-of-thumb-bound knowledge before tutorials

As evidenced in the pre-tutorial DAI, CP only had vague, discrete, unsystematic knowledge of academic writing context, akin to rules of thumb he acquired from his learning and publishing experiences. CP mentioned in his biodata questionnaire that he recalled the writing course about “logical structure in writing”, which “started with Introduction, went on with Modelling and Methods, and ended with Results and Discussion”. However, he could not recall many useful details, as he admitted rare application of what he learned from the classroom due to “much difficulty in applying these general rules to every situation of writing in his area”.

In Excerpt 1, CP displayed some confusion about applying acquired knowledge about logical organization.

Excerpt 1. CP: ((gasping)) […] I found what was learned ((the logical organization of writing)) in class a far cry from the reality in our discipline. […] The articles on numerical simulation have a fixed organization ((like the way mentioned)). But for the article of theoretical modeling I am on now, it is like developing from nothing. So, I develop my own way of writing, merely following my own logic for model building. I never, or only rarely consult other materials. (pre-tutorial DAI)

In Excerpt 1, CP's current knowledge about the organization pattern of a research article was limited to some empirical rules, explained by his English teacher, which CP did not find applicable to his own writing practice. This everyday concept could not provide an orienting basis for him to take reasonable actions in writing. Consequently, he had devised a personal way to organize his articles, which were often criticized as, in his advisor's word, “unintelligible” (CP, pre-tutorial DAI & session 6), meaning hard to read or understand.

As revealed in his answers concerning the aspects of context, CP had little awareness of disciplinary or academic community, affordances for writing that could be found by referring to related materials and literature, distinctive ways of constructing knowledge (i.e., text organization and move structures) shared among all insiders, writing support from other insiders and their comments, or the established writing conventions within a certain community. All of these largely constitute the field for contextualizing the academic writing activity. Excerpt 2, for instance, reveals this deficiency in his systematic understanding of academic English writing conventions.

Excerpt 2.CP: What do they ((the conventions)) refer to? $+ + 1$ I know some unwritten rules $= +$ ACTA for example. An article submitted to it has to cite other papers from it, better from its latest volume. $+ S \mathrm { i } \mathbf { x }$ or more citations. Does it count? (pretutorial DAI)

Excerpt 2 shows that the convention-bound rules he mentions were just everyday concepts from CP's learning experiences or other sources. If he decided to comply with them, it was not because he understood the underlying rationale, but in the hope that his compliance would increase the probability of his article submission being accepted.

Regarding the crucial factors that mediate his writing, what he could think of are some forms of visible assistance, for example, editorial services for improving language quality and discussion conducive to the formation of insightful ideas in his article. Thus, he denied that his article writing was solo work (Excerpt 3).

Excerpt 3.CP: Definitely no. I mean, […] discussion with my advisor. Without it,[…]I might not have developed the proposition of my article.[…]and help from fellow students, seniors[…]and juniors.[…]their contributions in the discussion, were helpful to my work. (pre-tutorial DAI)

Excerpt 3 shows that the denial originated from the substantial help CP received from members of his immediate local research community, instead of from his awareness of the intangible influence exerted by other tools and cultural artefacts (e.g., literature, model texts, insiders' comments, the journal's Guide for Authors) on knowledge co-construction in writing.

In sum, CP's responses to the pre-tutorial DAI suggested that he had rule-of-thumb bound knowledge of academic writing that might inform his action of writing (van Compernolle, 2011). This knowledge was conducive to developing only partial perception of the writing context, as it was either too general or too empirical to be applied in a changed context of use. Growing out of this limiting knowledge was CP's confusion about whether to apply what was learned, when to apply it and what to do as appropriate in new situations. As such, he demonstrated little voluntary control over the use of context-related discourse features, as evidenced in his creation of a personal logical text organization in his current new article. He did not consider as significant “textual mentorship” (Li, 2007, p. 67), referees' preferences or reviewers' comments, nor did he intend to borrow useful tools, such as the received rhetorical structure for writing within certain areas, as described in the literature. He rarely considered the expectations of the target journal, nor did he ever give thought to its readership. In short, his prior knowledge is of little help for him to understand the role of these aforementioned cultural artefacts in shaping a desirable and contextually appropriate academic text. An overarching knowledge, which encompasses all instantiations and which is not subject to variation of context of use, is then needed for orienting writing activities.

# 4.1.2. C-BLI-mediated formation of conceptual knowledge

The C-BLI interventions that incorporated the symbolic mediation and dialogic mediation have afforded the process of L2 change in CP's thinking, from discrete everyday concepts to systematic scientific concepts. This change has been observed in many language learning instances where co-construction of knowledge and learning opportunities occur (Gutierrez, 2008  ).

For example, in Session 3 in which writing contextual components were introduced, the tutor first elicited CP's impression of the sample research articles provided before the tutorials (including five articles from 1998 and five articles from more recent years, from 2016 to 2018, randomly chosen from the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering), then led him to connect the global text organization or the logical way of presenting ideas in the articles to the subconcept of context.

Excerpt 4.Tutor: Have you ever considered why the five authors basically adopted the same organization pattern?, CP: ((resulting from)) cognitive development.[…]Writing according to these ((same)) lines of organization, facilitates reviewing. Tutor: Yes. What's more, we just mentioned context,[…]We cannot separate our own discourse, writing, OK, from the context. When you decide to write an article, what will you choose to read from the target journal? CP: Some good article Tutor: And its guidelines, submission guidelines, do you?[…]So, in those authors, the cognitive development might CP: AH, arise from the journal. Tutor: You mentioned, your target journal requires several citations of articles from it in your own article. CP: A rule. Tutor: Apart from learning the latest disciplinary developments ((from the cited articles)), you as a reader, learn to follow their way of presenting ideas while reading, do you. […] And then in your own writing, you imitate their way. CP: That is to say, this journal requirement is $^ +$ very reasonable.

As shown in Excerpt 4, tutor intervention assisted CP in attaining an “AH” moment. A discourse marker such as “AH” brackets stages of cognitive development where L2 change is occurring or adjusting, and overtly marks “the transitional stage” to “the regulatory state of the novice in relation to the developing item or structure” (Gutierrez, 2008  , pp. 131e132). To wit, this “AH” moment indicated a conceptual connection captured in CP's thinking between context and a property of language (i.e., the discourse feature of global text organization) to which research article writing is applied. At this point, journal context was not merely a technical term to CP any more. Instead, it became developed understanding, which was related to the rule of thumb but transcended the specifications of the rule. CP became aware that for him to make meaningful and smooth communication through his research article, he was obliged to look to the journal context for orientation in writing activity. In addition, the tutor directed CP's consciousness to another rule d to cite the latest articles from the target journal, enabling him to reflect on its link to journal context. Before the tutorials, CP followed this rule without knowing the rationale, merely because it applied to action. At this moment, assisted by the tutor, CP figured out the “reasonable” justification that was endorsed by the conceptual knowledge. As such, CP's citing of the latest articles and his reading of them in order to borrow a received organization pattern for use in his own writing would be mediated and oriented by his consciousness of journal context (which is further discussed in 4.2).

After session 3, CP was more sensitive than before to the role of other context-related artefacts during his writing, e.g., insiders' comments. CP invited comments from several competent senior fellow students in his discipline. Samples of those comments are shown in Fig. 3. Comment 1 explicates the purpose of the referred part to be identifying research gaps between CP's work and that of others for referees and readers, and therefore suggests that CP should explain the possible adverse effects of leaving out the models in addition to describing the insufficiencies in others' work. Comment 2 suggests that in the following part CP should highlight his contribution by illustrating the advantages of his own work in relation to the aforementioned insufficiencies. The tutor and CP discussed CP's reflection on these comments in Session 5 (Excerpts 5 and 6).

Excerpt 5. Tutor: Do you think his comments are of constructive help to you? To which aspect ((subconcept)) do you think it relates? CP: Yeah. I think it is about logicality of ((required by)) context. It means if I don't clarify the adverse effects of missing out those models, the research significance of our work seems unclear […]It is important $^ +$ context $^ +$ or say, it is an issue of the large academic context, the way of thinking shared by this((academic))community.

In Excerpt 5, CP was able to direct the empirical rule instructed by an insider to the knowledge of context, and quickly verbalized his understanding of the link “in the physical absence of SCOBA” (Lantolf & Zhang, 2017, p. 150). This verbalization was not an imitative explication learned from the tutorials, but manifested his transformative knowledge. The learned explanation of the concept from SCOBAs and the tutor mediation served as tools for CP's thinking. Thus, when the tutor suggested that he diagnose the situated rationality of the empirical rule, he judged it as “important”. He was aware that the subconcept, or “the large academic context” to be more specific, applied to this empirical rule as it directed to an illustrative feature of context d “the way of thinking shared by this community”. In a sense, CP's mapping of context onto this empirical rule is indicative of CP's developing ability in concept appropriation.

Excerpt 6.Tutor: What about this ((comment 2)), $^ +$ Which ((subconcept)) do you think applies to it?, CP: It $\operatorname { i s } \mathrm { + m h m } +$ about logicality $+ \left[ \ldots \right]$ Does context or linguistic aspect apply? Let me think. […] I think context applies. It is similar to, say, the discourse circuit we talked about previously $^ +$ that the conclusion is to answer the questions raised in the introduction.

In Excerpt 6, the tutor alerted CP to the concept application in Comment 2. After reflection, CP found that context still applied. In this instance, his verbalization of metalinguistic terms such as “logicality” and “discourse circuit” marked his developing transformative knowledge. It was also demonstrated by the analogy that CP made between two different situations. One was about “discourse circuit”d how “so-what” questions proposed in the introduction are answered in the conclusion, which was introduced in Session 4 as well as in instructional materials. The other was illustrated in Comment 2, calling for two separate parts in the Introduction section to show how a gap in the aforementioned literature has been filled. This analogy, together with CP's metalinguistic knowledge, points to CP's development in internalizing the subconcept.

# 4.1.3. Concept-bound knowledge after tutorials

After five weekly C-BLI tutorials, CP developed new understandings of academic literacy competence and its impact on composing research articles. For example, he updated his understanding of the significance of contextual components and of how they mediate an object-directed writing activity (Excerpt 7).

Excerpt 7. CP: The most important, now I think is context ((grinning)) […]NO article would be a good piece, without considering the contextual components of the journal. What's more, $^ +$ to comply with $[ \ldots ] +$ erh, writing conventions, $^ { 0 \mathrm { f } + }$ say, the large academic community, then of one's own disciplinary community and that of one's own area $^ +$ ((To organize writing)) in a way readily accepted by readers. In addition, more specifically speaking $^ +$ is to follow move structure of, mhm $+$ every part((as in published articles)), to make the writing sound logical. This maybe is the most important $^ +$ basis for writing a good piece.

In Excerpt 7, CP developed his awareness of writing from treating it as a way of expressing personal arguments to a clear consciousness of its situatedness, requiring the writer's presentation to be in line with the discourse style accepted by readers as insiders. He began to bracket together his everyday knowledge of writing conventions, academic community, disciplinary community, move structure and the like under the general category of context/contextual components. This categorization marked a shift in CP's thinking from the rule-of-thumb-bound type to the concept-bound type (van Compernolle, 2011), which meant that he began to ponder his conscious choices of specific discourse features in terms of this subconcept.

In Excerpt 8, when asked about the influence of conventions on writing, CP displayed an emergent coherent and systematic understanding of the contextuality of a writing activity, and how this understanding mediated action or a plan for action.

Excerpt 8. CP: ((I)) Know to what to do ((in writing)). This is direct influence. For the article I am on, I feel there is a sequence of to-do list. I should first decide on the target journal […], rather than complete the article first and then make adaption according to journal requirements. It is wrong. ((laughing))

Before C-BLI tutorials, CP's rule-of-thumb-bound understanding of some contextual components merely influenced his decision about whether or not to follow suit. As evidenced in his pre-tutorial DAI, when an empirical rule applied to a specific situation (i.e., in case of submission to ACTA), he followed suit; when it did not apply, he was then at a loss as to what to do (i.e., when developing the global organization for his new article). At this point after tutorials, however, he was able to link this subconcept to the rules of thumb, then developed an action orientation from the link that guided him to map out “a sequence of to-do list”. He was aware that determining a target journal was a priority rule and mediator of his writing action, because it is crucial to contextualize the writing activity and choices of appropriate discourse features.

Excerpt 9. CP: I wil $^ +$ ((learn))its expectations, including requirements for citations, conventions concerning writing organization, move structures and so on. I will write in light of these rules. The writing may be clearer[…]In addition, the academic community, the disciplinary community, and advisors and fellow students included, have indirect effect, I mean from our meetings, other literature or reviewers’ comments, I can also learn some, $^ +$ what to ${ \mathrm { d } } 0 { \mathrm { = } } 1$ ((while writing)).

In Excerpt 9, as CP continued, he appeared to have integrated his previous rules-of-thumb-bound knowledge into his developing conceptual understanding. In other words, he was capable of generalizing actions of writing by singling out those

properties of language (in terms of forms and features, e.g., “citations, writing organization, move structures”) to which the action was to be applied. As such, he developed a conceptual connection between these properties and the material mediational tools of action (e.g., journal guidance, “meetings” with “advisors and fellow students”, “other literature” and “reviewers’ comments”), and would be able to steer action on the basis of the reflection in consciousness of the generalized properties and the connection.

In sum, those modifications between CP's pre- and post-tutorial responses, and the language learning instances during the C-BLI treatment all instantiate significant changes in his understanding of the context for academic writing. At the outset, CP could only name some specific rules, the knowledge of which was particularly limited and limiting in steering action in new situations, since confusion and difficulty arose from applying them to new writing practices. By contrast, in the post-tutorial DAI, he introduced “journal context”, “conventions of disciplinary community”, “community of one's own area”, indicating development in knowledge from concrete and discrete everyday concepts to abstract and systematic scientific concepts, or from rule-of-thumb-bound thinking to concept-bound thinking. Secondly, by identifying shared properties of language at discourse level to which writing actions are to be applied, e.g., “a way readily accepted by readers”, “move structure”, “logical writing”, CP established a link between the subconcept and his everyday knowledge, and then the use of these properties. In so doing, and most crucially, CP developed his perception of the use of the conceptualization as an orienting basis for “what to do” in new actions/activities, suggesting a unity of cognition and action.

The C-BLI treatment has to some extent developed the learner's conceptual understanding. There is evidence of the C-BLI treatment assisting CP in moving from merely naming some context-related empirical rules provided by his teachers and other sources, to generalizing shared properties of language use with the knowledge of the overarching subconcept, and in turn in using the subconcept to orient action in new object-directed writing activities.

4.2. RQ2: how did C-BLI help the learner develop his performance in academic writing?

This section shows how the pedagogical treatment and developing knowledge of context assisted CP to map the conceptualization onto his use of discourse features to make meaningful communication in the writing activity. This was captured through the analysis of changes in CP's article drafts before, during and immediately after the C-BLI treatment, and his verbalized reflections on the changes.

# 4.2.1. Changes in global and local organization patterns

As demonstrated earlier, knowledge of context was co-constructed and gradually emerged in CP's thinking after Session 3. Thereafter, he actively looked to some sociocultural artefacts (e.g., the journal Guide for Authors, articles from the journal, etc.) as mediators for successful writing and as essential factors that helped contextualize his writing. He changed his preparatory action for writing from “rarely consult[ing] other materials” to earnestly reading $\bullet _ { 2 0 }$ papers or so from Acta” and “the journal guidelines” (CP, Session 4). Subsequently, he learned that the article structure specified in the Guide generally “follows the common IMRD format”, with variations (Excerpt 10).

Excerpt 10. CP: It ((the article structure)) should go like this, the ubiquitous Introduction […] Material and methods. Tutor: Material and methods?, CP: I hardly noticed the Material before. […] I have considered that $^ +$ this actually $^ +$ contains […] things like experiments $^ +$ experimental facilities. As for my current article, the system components can be put under it. For my next revision, I will make some changes here.

Accordingly, CP's incorporation of this context-related artefact mediated his action in making revisions in the following drafts (see Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, CP added “Material” as a subtitle for the second part of his article, and made other

# B.Discussion

Based on the distributions of the state and structural parameters, the influences of different parameters on the system scheme were analyzed. These parameters included the material type of the LOX tank and the battery type. In addition, the pump power and the subsystem mass ratio were selected as the evaluation index to analyze the performance of the system. Some suggestions about the system scheme design could be provided based on the above analysis

system. However, in the above studies, the whole system components were not given. The valve model, the pipe model and the chamber mass model were also not consideredtaken into consideration. The state and structure parameter distributions of the systems were not given, which made the understanding not deep. Above questions may lead to a lagre computation error and an incomplete understangding about this kind of engine. parameters of the subassemblies were calculated based on the input parameters. Especially Our study highlighted the pressure-drop models of the pipe and the cooling channels, and the mass model of the chamber were taken into aecount.These models may lead to a smaller computation error. In the design. Fthe state and structural parameter distributions were firstly initilly proposed for investigating the system performance. Further, the influences of the corresponding alterations. Following the Guide, he also changed the title of section III from “Computation method and input parameters” into “Calculation method”, and the name of Part An under Section III from “Computation method” to “Calculation models”. CP seemingly only made nuanced changes. But those revisions were valuable in that they represented CP's voluntarily controlled action. He mentioned in the pre-tutorial DAI that given the inapplicability of the organization pattern introduced in his English writing class, he developed a pattern on his own. By contrast, he became aware that “the journal regulates the writing by recommending a normative organization mode” and that “I should revise my article according to it” “to meet the requirement” and “to make the writing more logical” (CP's monologic verbalized reflections by referring to the pedagogical diagram only, Session 6). In this instance, he was conscious of the object-regulation and readily began to assume responsibility to correct the gap between his own language production and the desired one, which means he was at a relatively high level of “transition from intermental to intramental” regulatory functioning (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994, p.470, cited in Gutierrez, 2008  ).

Additionally, this awareness of context mediated CP's plan for writing each part in the article, i.e., to “follow move structure” extracted from relevant model articles. This is particularly visible in the change in how CP organized the “Results and Discussion” section between the drafts before and after the C-BLI treatment (see Fig. 5). As is shown on the left column of Fig. 5, in the draft before the treatment, CP presented the results in the order of his calculational procedures and described them abruptly to readers by putting them directly under the subtitle without a transition. He then moved on to discuss them one by one in the following discussion subsection. The right column of Fig. 5 shows overt revisions made to this section in the draft after C-BLI. He arranged the results and the accompanying discussion in two subsections, “Investigation on pump power performance” and “Investigation on system dry mass”, to echo the two highlights of his engine system design (i.e., “the pressure-drop models” and “the mass model”) proposed in the Abstract and the Introduction. The source for this change can be traced back to the dialogic interaction in Session 4, which is illustrated in Excerpt 11.

Excerpt 11. CP: Some articles ((among the 20 articles)) I read from Acta $^ +$ have a very simple structure, containing only three ((four)) sections[…] the introduction, […]methods $^ +$ results, $^ +$ and also conclusion. […]Tutor: That means, they might have merged the results and the discussion into one section $^ +$ and analyzed the data directly after presenting them? CP: mhmþ((thinking)) some do in this way $^ +$ some deal with them in two subsections.[…] Sometimes I could not distinguish clearly these two parts.[…] I am going to read more articles from Acta.

In this instance, the microgenesis affordance (Gutierrez, 2008  ) occurred when the tutor alerted CP to the possible structures employed by authors of Acta articles. This affordance allowed CP's further planned action of “borrowing” (Li, 2007, p. 68), which marked his beginning to incorporate sociocultural artefacts from another communicative activity (i.e., literature reading) into his own thinking and communicative activity (i.e., research article writing). In so doing, he gradually gained more conscious control over his writing performance with the presence of these mediational tools.

# 4.2.2. Changes in the logic of language

In addition to the context-mediated changes in organization patterns, CP made many modifications to the logic of language within and between sentences and in each part because he deemed reader approval “a most important determiner” (CP, posttutorial DAI) for a successful research article and thought that his article “must be intended for the readership” (CP, session 5). He consciously drew on some linguistic resources for the research article genre (e.g., high lexical density and cohesive devices, which is another focus of the entire study), and corrected the omissions in content as well.

For example, in the draft following Session 5, when the tutor and CP discussed the comments that CP received (see Excerpts $5 \& 6$ ), CP added “Above questions may lead to a large computation error and an incomplete understanding about this kind of engine” to express “adverse effects”, and then in the following part added “These models may lead to a smaller computation error”, both to answer how the “adverse effects” are resolved and to show the “research significance” of the work (see Fig. 6). In so doing, he “increased the logicality” (CP's monologic verbalized reflections, Session 6) by achieving a discourse circuit at a micro level in the Introduction, accommodating his writing by packing the constructed knowledge in the discourse in a way that was both more logical and more persuasive to the readers. This change did not arise from CP's obedience to reviewers' words (see Fig. 3), but from his reasoning about their appropriacy in this situation “in light of the corresponding (sub)concept” (CP, post-tutorial DAI). This can be justified by CP's unguided but voluntary action of adding the sentence, “These models may improve the computation precision” in the Abstract of the same draft to align with the change in the Introduction. Specifically, the improved performance in writing is an encouraging result from CP's effort to achieve this meaning potential as well as from his conscious appropriation of concepts into his thinking (i.e., planning for writing) and his writing activity.

In summary, the C-BLI treatment has to some extent promoted learner performance in the writing activity. There is evidence that concept materialization and dialogic verbalization in the treatment provides the learner with the metalanguage for explaining action in relation to the subconcept. The pedagogical interventions enable concept externalization, thus bringing the subconcept-related knowledge under conscious inspection and modifying already existing knowledge (e.g., a rule of thumb). When an empirical rule does not apply to a changed context of use, the learner then knows to look to the context-related mediational tools (e.g., journal articles, journal guidelines, insiders' comments) to guide his choice of appropriate discourse features. Moreover, during the reciprocating writing process of thinking and performing writing, the treatment assists the learner by providing repeated access to the (sub)concept and facilitates the process of concept appropriation/internalization. In a word, the regulating power is gradually transferred from material objects and the “other”, i.e., the tutor, to the learner's higher-order mental functioning, conducive to self-regulation in actions relating to the writing activity.

# 5. Conclusion

This study proposed a sociocultural framework for the L2 academic literacy development of Chinese postgraduate students when learning academic writing across disciplines. The theoretical grounds d academic writing as a mediated objectdirected activity and the development of conceptual knowledge in terms of academic literacy d are two important instructional foci in praxis. The findings have shown that the learner's awareness of contextual components, and the accordingly “useful rhetorical consciousness” (Swales, 2019, p. 76) which influence purposeful communication in writing, were emergent and then increased through C-BLI interventions as he learned to appropriate the SCOBAs and the conceptual knowledge they depict for understanding pertinent rules of thumb, relevant discourse features, related sociocultural artefacts and their relation to contexts of use. Notably, the study documented a shift from rule-of-thumb-bound thinking to a clear perception of concept as a complete and systematic orienting basis for action (performance). A concept encompasses a large majority of instantiations of use of discourse features; it is therefore not subject to variation according to contexts of use. The findings also revealed the learner's orientation to academic discourse context as a thinking tool for judging the appropriateness of rules and choices of specific discourse features in specific contexts of use, which in turn mediated his planning for writing, leading to increasing voluntary control over his choice of appropriate features for subsequent textual realization in the writing activity (i.e., development in academic literacy).

The study has both theoretical and pedagogical implications, although it only generated preliminary findings on the subconcept of context or contextual components in the development of L2 academic literacy through C-BLI. Theoretically, it expands the paradigm of sociocultural theory applying to the praxis of L2 writing education by implementing C-BLI in a mediated academic writing activity and affording higher-order thinking for learners' L2 use, resulting in the development of academic literacy. Unlike the common practices of research on academic literacy which always concentrate on the general textual analysis of “big (corpus) data” (Junnier, 2020, p. 2), it adopts microgenesis to track the trajectory of change in the learner's metalinguistic knowledge (i.e., scientific conceptual knowledge) and examines how this knowledge orients the learner to improve writing performance through subsequent textual realization. To wit, this study adds to the currently limited empirical literature of applying SCT framework to L2 academic literacy education. Pedagogically, the study offers insights into C-BLI curriculum design-informed literacy and concept-based materials, and teacher development to stimulate teacher awareness. Teachers should be cognizant of their critical role as human mediators to support learning and the internalization of concepts, and to regulate learners' use of L2 forms and features, while at the same time not forcing or dictating their “own will to them” (van Compernolle, 2014, p. 83). Teachers can be trained in C-BLI-related pedagogical content knowledge to implement systematic explicit teaching of pertinent concepts in academic writing instruction.

The study shows that C-BLI is a promising approach to operationalize SCT principles in L2 academic literacy educational praxis. Further research should explore the effectiveness of C-BLI in a classroom-based context, focusing on learners’ development in the teacher-led, peer-to-peer, and/or group-based in-class discussion of relevant concepts and writing activities. Such a program would have great potential to inform the accessibility and extension of the sociocultural framework in L2 educational praxis.
