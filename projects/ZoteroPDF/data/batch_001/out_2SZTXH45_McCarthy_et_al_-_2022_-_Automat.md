The benefits of writing strategy feedback are well established. This study examined the extent to which adding spelling and grammar checkers support writing and revision in comparison to providing writing strategy feedback alone. High school students $( n = 1 1 9 )$ wrote and revised six persuasive essays in Writing Pal, an automated writing evaluation and tutoring system. All participants received automated strategy feedback after writing the first draft of their essays. Half of the participants were also given access to spelling and grammar checkers while writing. Spelling and grammar feedback on its own had no effect on the quality of students' first draft. Linear mixed effects models revealed improvements from initial draft to revision on most subscales. The addition of spelling and grammar feedback contributed small but significant gains after revision on five subscales (i.e., mechanics, word choice, voice, conclusion, and organization) but no other aspects of the students' essays. Qualitative exploration of exemplar students' revision moves revealed how students incorporated both strategy and spelling and grammar feedback into their revisions. Findings from this study demonstrate that strategy feedback with an opportunity to revise contributed to improved essay quality, but that spelling and grammar feedback provided modest, complementary benefits.

# 1. Introduction

The widespread use of word processors has made instantaneous feedback on spelling and grammar a common part of the writing experience (e.g., Morphy & Graham, 2012). Modern automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems are often expected to include spelling and grammar checking tols, and services such as Grammarly promise that the use of their checkers will make \*everyone a great writer' (Grammarly, 2019). However, despite the growing lit of spelling and grammar checkers available in a variety of languages, as well as theassumption that pelling and grmar feack is nesary for goodwritin, there is itle emprical work that asseses whether these tools improve overall writing quality. High-quality writing emerges not only from mastery of pelling and mechanics, but from a cer structure and coherence of the content (see Graham & Harris, 2016). Across a number of age groups, the most effective means of improving writing is through instruction on writingstrategies for planning, drafin, and revising essays for content coupled with opportunities for writing practice with formative feedack (Gillespie & Graham, 2014; Graham & Perin, 2007; Graham, 2006; Graham, Capizz et al., 2014; Graham, Hars, & Chambers, 2015; Graham, MacArthur, & Fitzgerald, 2013; Kiuhara, Graham, & Hawken, 2009). However,this does not exclude the need for supporting spelling and grammar improvements alongside formative strategy feedback.

Indeed, recent work aimed at supporting students' writing growth has emphasized the need for comprehensive, integrated writing support (Graham et al., 2012; Graham, Bruch et al., 2016). Efctive writing clearly conveys the author's intended meaning and is appropriate for the given audience and context. Expert on writig instruction emphasize that effective essays are marked by specific feates that inlude organization and stucture, a clear voice, correct use f genre conventions, as well a grmmar, unctuation, and spelling (Graham, Bruch et al., 2016, pg. 36). These panel recommendations argue that the most efecive way of supporting writing growth is through iterative model-practice-reflect cycles that encourage instruction, practice, and formative fedback along allkey features of writing (Graham, 2021). Thus, the goal of writing instruction and feedback research should not be to determine which type of feedback is best, but rather to develop a more nuanced understanding of how to best implement integrative writing support.

Although spelling and grammar feedback tools are essentiall omnipresent during most writing experiences, prior research on writing instruction and asssment does not provide clear answers regarding the potential ffects of providing spelig and grammar feedback in concert with formative trategy feedback. Speling and grammar feedback on their own are unlikely to yield substantial increases in overall writing quality, yet i is unknown how such targeted feedback may help or hinder writing when provided alongside strategy feedback known to support better writing. To address this gap in the iterature, ths study examines the effects of providing spelling and grammar checkers above and beyond writing strategy feedback on the quality of initil essays and revisions. Specificall, we contrast the effcts of receiving (a) formative strategy feedback alone, versus (b) formative strtegy fedback along with feedback on spelling and grammar. The efect of feedback are examined for six esas composed by 119 high school students in terms of holistic scores as well as nine subscales: (1) grammar, stle, and mechanics, (2) word choice (3) voce, (4) sentence structue, (5) intoduction paragraph quality, (6) body paragraph qualit, (7) concusion paragraph quality, (8) organization, and (9) unity. Asuch, this study assesses which aspects of essay revisions are afected by online feedback regarding mechanics, and the extent of strategy feedback uptake on essay revisions.

# 1.1. Improving writing via strategies and feedback

Less skilled and developing writers tend to knowledge-tell (e.g., Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986) in stream-of-consciousness, tran scribing each idea linearly as it comes to them with ittle regard to the writing goal or the intended audience. By contrast, skilled writers tend to be more strategic, intentional, and recursive. Successful writers engage in (at least) three overarching strategic activities a) planning, (b) drafting, and (c) revising (e.g., Flower & Hayes, 1981; Hayes, 2012). Coordinating these processes, enacting underlying sills, and drawing upon relevant knowledge are often challenging to developing writers (McNamara & Allen, 2017) and ofen lead students to struggle on writing asessments (NAEP, 2012). The central aim of writing instruction is thus to prepare students to understand and navigate these challenges (Harris et al., 2011).

The most successul writing strategy interventions involve providing developing writers with actionable and intentional procedures and "tols" that they can apply to a variety of writing tasks (e.g., Gillspie & Graham, 2014; Graham & Perin, 2007; Graham et l., 2013; Gram, itken, et al., 2020; Graham, Capizz t al., 2014; Graham, Banales et al., 2020). Deeoping writers must also have the opportunity to engage in deliberate practice with the strategies and receie fedback. That is they must be offered ample time to compose their essays and receive formative fedback that helps them to understand how to beter plan, draft, and revise their essays. Strategy instruction that targets key writing processes (e.g., planning and revising) leads to strong and positive effects on writing performance (e.g., $E S = 0 . 8 2 $ ; Graham & Perin, 2007). Further, engaging in iterative drafting and revision cycles with formative feedback ls t improved essa qualit and writing kill(eg., Mcamara  Allen, 2017; Bter  Brt, 2011; Graham & Perin, 2007; Hillocks, 1984; Kellogg & Raulerson, 2007; Midgette, Haria, & MacArthur, 2008, Par & Timperley, 2010; Proske et al., 2012; Santangelo, Harris, & Graham, 2016).

# 1.2. Spelling and grammar feedback

Despite consistent research findings on the importance of writing strategy instruction and fedback, many students and instructors tend to focus on mechanical erors such as spelling and grammar (e.g., Otnes & Solheim, 2019; Underwood & Tregidgo, 2006). However, the salience and impact of mechanical errors in writing depends on the audience and the measure. For example, Graham,

Aitken, et al. (2020a), Graham, Banale, et al. (2020b) found that children with reading difficulties scored lower on essays, but that norm referenced measures (e.g., standardized tests) tended to be more sensitive to mechanical erors as compared to writing assessments developed by reearchers. Along these line, Crossey et al. (2014) found that there was ittle nfluence of mechanical erors on expert raters evaluations of essays. They asked expert raters with at least 4 years ofexperience in teaching composition to score 100 student essays using the standardized SAT rubric (1-6). They found that mechanics errors i students essays were not significantly predictive of the raters' scores.

By contrast, mechanical errors in writing can be highly salient to typical or "everyday" readers (e.g., peers, colleagues, and potential employers; Boland & Queen, 2016; Figueredo & Varnhagen, 2005; Johnson, Wilson, & Roscoe, 2017; Marshall 1967). For example, Johnson et al. (2017) asked college students to read essays exhibiting spelling and grammar errors versus content and structure errors, or a mix of both. Student raters asigned significantl lower writing quality scores based on spelling and grammar errors. Moreover, pelig and grammar rror also led participants to perceive the essy writers more negatiely (e.g., unintelligent, disloyal, and unkind).

Notably, students who place greater value on conventions and mechanics tend to be les skilled writers compared to those who recognize the importance of content and structure (MacArthur, Philippakos, & Graham, 2016). Additionll, there are mixed findings regarding the benefit or detriments of providing feedback and instruction regarding writing mechanics. On the one hand, pelling and grammar feedback and instruction can be beneficial for elementary school students who are developing lower-level litracy skills (Graham & Santangelo, 2014) as wllas non-native language learners (e.g., Chodorow, Gamon, & Tetreault, 2010; Heift & Rimrot, 2008). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that grammar checkers can increase writers motivation and confidence (Cavaleri & Dianati, 2016; Potter & Fuler, 2008). However, there is reason to suspect that the availability and use of spelling and grammar feedback for proficient speaker e.g., native language adolescents and adults) may have littl effct and even negative effects on writing qualit. Drawing attention to these mechanical errors can misdirect students' attention to les important features of writing, biasing their atention to these errors and preventing them from giving thir fll atention to the content or structure of their esays (Graham & Santangelo, 2014; Morphy & Graham, 2012). Consequentl, providing immediate spelig and grammar feedback (e.g, via checking tools) may indirectly hinder writing quality by reinforcing such biased atention. I terms of instruction beyond feedback messages, there is evidence that grammar instruction is not efective in improving writing qualit. In several writing interventions, grammar instruction served as a control condition for other instruction types. Indeed, the meta-analysis conducted by Graham and Perin (2007) indicated that explicit grammar instruction had a reliably negative impact $( E S = - 0 . 3 2 )$ on writing performance, further suggesting that increasing attention to mechanical issues is inefective for enhancing writing quality. Importantly, this same meta-analysis highlights that litle work has ben conducted to examine the efects of spellig fedback or instruction on adolescent and adult writers.

In sum, research suggests that spelling and grammar feedback in isolation may be relatively ineffective for helping students develop their writing skill. However, most AWE systems have the capability of providing formative strtegy feedack in addition to or instead of) spelling and grammar fdback alone. Few or no studies have directly tested the benefitsof spelling and grammar feedback within an AWE context (cf., Grimes & Warschauer, 2010; Lin, Liu, & Paas, 2017), and no studies have directly examined the effects of combining spelling and grammar feedback with strategy feedback.

# 1.3. Automated writing evaluation and feedback

Writing technologies have reshaped the way that people write and the way that writing is taught (Graham, 2021). Advances in technology have not only made spelling and grammar checkers readily available, but also made the assessment and feedback of writing more rapid and personalized. Automated essay scoring (AES) systems originally emerged as a means of assessing student writing in large-scale standardized testing contexts; however, many AES systems have been modified for classroom use such that they also provide formative feedack. In automated writing evaluation (AwE) systems, students engage in cycles of writing, receiving feedback, and revising. The most familiar tols include Educational Testing Service's e-Rater (Attali & Burstein, 2006 see also Hazelton, Nastal, Elliot, Burstein, & McCaffrey, 2021), Vantage Learning' ItelliMetrc (Elliot, 2003), and PEG Writing (now MI Write; Page, 2003). However, there are a variet of different AWEs available commerciall and in the research sector (Allen & Perret, 2016). In a recent systematic review, Strobl et al. (2019) identified nearly 90 automated writing evaluators. AWEs use natural language processing-driven scoring algorithms (or scoring engines) to provide both summatie numeri scores as wel as formative feedback for essays and other open-ended responses see Shermis & Burstein, 2013; ee also Alle et al., 2016; Strobl et al., 2019. The types and quality of feedback provided vary from system to system. Notably thesesystems are not designed to replace instruction. Rather, AWEs are viewed as instructional supplements. They can provide rapid scoring and deliver feedback at scale. An entire clas of students can receive one-on-one support and engage in multiplecycles of writing and revisions in asingle stting (Stevenson & Phakiti, 2014). AWES can also enable multiple iterations of feedback, such that students can addres mechanical errors and basi organizational or structural issues before submitting to their instructor. Instructors can then dedicat their energy toward feedback on content (Link, Mehrzad, & Rahimi, 2020; Wilson & Czik, 2016).

Early work in AWEs was conducted primarily with native-speaking high school and college students (Grimes & Warschauer, 2010; Stevenson & Phakiti 2014). More recently, arelatively lrge body f rearch has focused n second language (L2) students laning to read and write in English (e.g., El Ebyary & Windeatt, 2010; Li, Feng, & Saricaoglu, 2017; Li, Link, & Hegelheimer, 2015; Zhang & Hyland, 2018). Research with L2 students has reported on AWEs' accuracy and quality as compared to human feedack (e.g., Atali & Burstein, 2006; Dikli & Bleyle, 2014; Powers, Burstein, Chodorow, Fowles, & Kukich, 2002); how teachers and students perceive the system feedback (e.g., Bai & Hu, 2017; Dikli & leyle, 2014; 0Neill & Rusell, 2019; Rall, 2018) and how students integrate AWE feedback their revisions (Huang & Renandya, 2020; Koltovskaia, 2020). Students tend to find the feedback helpful and tend to be aware of the limitations and falliblity of computer-based feedback (Bai & Hu, 2017;). AWE feedback can lead to improved essay quality and, to some extent, improved writing quality over repeated practice (e.g., Wilson & Roscoe, 2020; Li et al., 2017).

Broadly peaking, AWEs have positive efect on student experience and writing quality (e.g., Shermis et al., 2016). Nonetheles, there are a number f studies that find no effects of AwEs. Differences in findings likely emerge due to the wide variety of manipulations and measures that have been used in these studies. In some cases, AWEs are compared to ano fedback control. In others, AWE are directly comparedto instructor fedack. These studies also vary in terms of the outcome of interest. In some studies, eficacy is measured using error rates that are specific o mechanic sues. In other studies, researcher examine the efect of AWE feedback on distal outcomes including over AWE-generated score, human ratings of overallqualit and improved course grades (se Stevenson & Phakiti, 2014, for a review). The difference i findins may also be a function of the WE in question. Some systems (e., Grammarly) primarly provide targeted feedback related to spelling, mechanics, and grammar. y corst, the Writing Paloffers fdack specific to writing proceses and strategies. Other systems (e.g., Criterion) provide feedback at both levels (see Stevenson & Phakiti, 2019) Different types and combinations of feedback are likely to lead to varying resuls i terms of students perceptions and more objective outcomes.

Collectively, research to-date suggests that AWEs can serve as a powerful vehicle to support student writing. However, we lack a coherent understanding of which pedagogical aproaches embedded within AWEs are most appropriae and yield meaningful learning outcomes (Palemo & Wilson, 2020; Warschauer & Ware, 2006). As such, the present study aims to better understand best practices for writing instruction within the context of automated writing evaluation.

# 2. The current study

The current study assesses the effects of providing (a) spelling and grammar feedback and/or (b) formative writing strategy feedback within an AWE system. Specifically, we examined how adding spelling and grammar checkers to The Writing Pal (w-Pal)10 AWE and tutoring system affected multiple dimensions of essay quality. High school participants wrote and revised a series of persuasive essays over several sessions. All participants received writing strategy feedback to guide their revisions, but half of the participants were also given access to spelling and grammar checking tools while writing and revising.

Given that strategy feedback was provided betwee initial draft and revision, our analyzes investigated the effcts of spelling and grammar fedack generally, but more spefically how they influenced the improvement of essy quality from first draft t final draft, above and beyond the increases afforded by the strategy feedback.

Our broadest research question pertained to overallessay quality. Prior research informed several competing hypotheses. irst, one hypothesis is that spelling and grammar fedback is drimental (1). During writing, spelling and grammar fdback may be intrusive to the writing process (Morphy & Graham, 2012). In the context of revision, participants tend to rely on les-productie revisions of mechanical errors (Crawford, Lloyd, & Knoth, 2008; Fitzgerald, 1987). By further directing students' atention to these isues, they may neglect more substantive revisions (e. ignore the strategy feeback in favor of minor corrections). Further, additional feedack may be too much of a good thing" For example, McCarthy and colleagues (2018) explored the effects of adding more metacognitive feedback to a literacy tutor and found that adding feedback after every task, in adition to feedack at the end of a ful instructional activity showed no positie gains in pre- to post-intervention and that this aditional fedback was harmful for les-skilld students. Thus, receiving spelling and grammar fedback may be detrimental in the sense that it could impede the use of strategy feedback, resulting in less improvement in the quality of students' essays from initial draft to revision.

By contrast, spelling and grammar feedback could benefit writing quality above and beyond strategy feedback alone (H2). Giving feedback on spelling and grammar may fre up students' time and resources for developing content and structure (Graham & San tangelo, 2014: Morphy & Graham, 2012). In thiscase, we would expect that students who have speling and grammar checkers available to them would write higher quality first drafts and have ample time to allocate to substantive revisions suggested by the strategy feedback If this were the case, we might observe higher scores for initial drafts and/or larger gains from initial drafts to revised drafts.

Finally, a third hypothesis is that there i no effect of spelling and grammar feedback (H3). Prior work (e.g., Crossley et al., 2014) demonstrates that exprt ratins of esa quality are driven by de fetures of composition ., the coheion, or uny of ides across the essay) and spelling and grammar mistakes have minimal impact. By this ogi, the addition of pelling and grammar checking tools

would have no direct effect on essay quality or improvements.

These hypotheses are relatively coarse-grained in the sense that they predict how spelling and grammar relate to overall essay quality. We thus extend our analyzes by assessing more fine-grained components of essay qualit - including specific scores for quality of the esays inroductions, bodies, and conclusions as well as their mechanics, sentence structure, and organization. We anticipate that those who are provided spelling and grammar fedback are likely to outperform their peers on the mechanics subscore given that they have accessto explicit corrections. However, i is les clear how spellig and grammar feedback might influence the other subscores. Thus, we explore whether spelling and grammar helps, harms, or has no effect on each of these subscores in addition to overall holistic score.

We also recognize that essay scores will be affected by other factors. For example, esy qualit tends to vary systemically as a function of writing prompt (Huot, 1990). In addition, essay quality is influenced by individualdifferences in general writing proficiency as wllas by other related literacy skills. Previous work has demonstrated that reading skill s strongly correlated with writing proficiency (Authors, xx). To account for this variance, we examine the impact of both prompt and reading skil on the uptake of feedback in the AWE system. In addition to these quantitative analyses of human ratings of essay qualit, we examine four exemplar essays t illustrat the various ways that students leverage both straty and spelling and grammar feedback to revise their esas and how these revisions relate to changes in essay subscores and overall quality scores.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Participants

High school students $( \mathtt { n } = 1 2 1$ ) were recruited from a large metropolitan area in the southwestern United States through flyers as well as radio and social media ads. Two participants dd not complete al 6 esays. The 119 participants who complete all esay drafts and are included in the subsequent analyses. One student did not complete the demographic questionnaire. The remaining 118 participants reported an average age of 17 $( M = 1 7 . 1 9 $ $S D = 1 . 2 8 $ , Range: 13-19). Demographically, $6 1 . 8 9 \%$ of participants selfidentified as female and $3 8 . 1 3 \%$ as male. Participants self-identified as Caucasian $( 5 4 . 2 3 \% )$ , Hispanic/Latin American $( 2 1 . 1 9 \% )$ Asian $( 1 0 . 1 7 \% )$ , African American $( 7 . 6 2 \% )$ , or as another race/ethnicity or multiracial $\left( 6 . 7 8 \% \right)$ . The majority of participants $( 8 7 . 2 8 \% )$ identified English as their native language.

Though randomly assigned, the non-native English speakers were split evenly across the two feedback conditions. The majorit of L2 students (8) identified Spanish as their native language. Other languages include Amharic, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, and Urdu. The majority indicated speaking English for more than 7 years.

# 3.2. Design

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two feedback conditions. Half of the participants received only automated formative strategy feedback (Strategy Condition, $n = 6 0 \mathrm { ~ . ~ }$ , and half of the participants received both formative strategy feedback and spelling and grammar feedback (Strategy $^ +$ SG Condition, $n = 5 9$

# 3.3. Materials

# 3.3.1. The Writing Pal (W-Pal)

w-Pal (Authors, xx) is an automated writing evaluation (AWE) tool and intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that teaches writing strategies and enables multiple forms of writing practice (e.g., game-based strategy practice and essay writig). W-Pal instruction targets eight diffrent aspects of writing: freewriting, planning, introduction building, body building, conclusion building, unity, paraphrasing, and revision. Importantly, in the current study, we examined only the AWE components of W-Pal-participants did not review strategy lessons or play practice games. In the AWE essay writing module, learners are assigned an SAT-styl persuasive essay prompt and have about $2 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to compose an initial draft. Once time has elapsed, several natural language processing-driven algorithms provide both a holisic score (on a 6-point scale) and personalized formative feedback. More details about W-Pal have ben reported in Authors (xxxx).

# 3.3.2. Essay prompts

Participants wrote and revised up to sixesays in response to prompts adapted from publicly released SAT exam materials. These prompts asked participants to adopt a stance with regard to acentral topic, and then to defend that position via evidence, examples, and/or logical reasoning. All prompts were designed to minimize prior knowledge demands such that participants could write from experience rather than constrained educational content or source materials. In each prompt, there was a brief introduction to the topic and then a final prompt question. For example, the prompt about \*images and impressions' appears below:

All around us appearances are mistaken for reality. Clever advertisements create favorable impressions but say littl or nothing about the products they promote. In stores, colorful packages are often better than their contents. In the media, how certain entertainers, politicians, and other public figures appear is sometimes considered more important than their abilities. All too often, what we think we see becomes far more important than what really is. Do images and impressions have a positive or negative effect on people?

Table 1 presents the focal question for each prompt, and the complete prompts are reported in Appendix A. For logistical purposes in administering the study, all prompts were presented in the same order for all participants.

# 3.3.3. Strategy feedback messages

In W-Pal, formativefedback messages recommend actionable stes and strategies for improving an essay via prewriting, drafting and revising. These messages can addres a variet of concerns such as generating and elaboration ideas, organizing ideas, crafting strong introductions and conclusions, providing meaningful examples and evidence, building cohesion, choosing appropriate and precise words, and overall revisig. Cruciall, participants never receive feedack on all categorie for any given essy. Algorithms identify the most salient problem areas first. Such algorithms are based on NLP tools that evaluate linguistic, syntactic, and semantic features relevant to common challenges and weaknesses in participant writing (e.g., poorly developed ideas and low cohesion). Table B2 briefly provides example feedback messages participants could receive regarding structre, concusion bulding, or cohesion.

# 3.3.4. Spelling and grammar feedback

Participants in the Strategy $^ +$ SG Condition were given access to "Check Spelling" and "Check Grammar" buttons at the bottom of the essay window (Fig. 1). Participants could access either function at any time during writing or revising.

When participants used the checkers, relevant errors were underlined within the text, similar to features common in word processing software. Specificall, errors were detected using the open-source API Languageool (Mikowski, 2010; Naber, 2003). Clicking on the error opened a small pop-up window containing potentil corrections. To ensure that participants did not overlook the checking tools, reminder about the checkers appeared when there were five minutes remaining in the writing session. However, participants were not forced to use the tools.

# 3.3.5. Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test

The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test (GMRT; MacGinitie, MacGinitie, Cooter, & Curry, 1989) was included to assessrading skill which is corrlated with writing ability (Authors, xx). The GMRT is a standardized test in which participants read passages and then answer multiple-choice questions about them. The test contains 48-item multiple-choice items and is a reliable and well-established measure of reading comprehension ( $\mathbf { \dot { \alpha } } ( \mathbf { \alpha } ) = 0 . 8 5 \mathbf { - } 0 . 9 2$ ; Phillips, Norris, Osmond, & Maynard, 2002).

# 3.4. Procedure

This project was reviewed and approved by the universty's Institutional Review Board prior to alldata collection. The study took place over four sessions. In Session 1, participants completed a demographic questionnaire and the GMRT. In Sessions 2 through 4, participants authored essays in response to six persuasive prompts (i.e, two prompts per session) using W-Pal. For each prompt, participants were allotted $2 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to compose an initial draft. After the 25 min elapsed, a pop-up window appeared with an algorithmgenerated holistic rating from Por' to "Great" (with six levels along with formative strategy fedback. The window displayed only one feedback message tht targeted a critical writing strategy for the current essay. Participants could voluntarily reques to receive and view additional feedback-up to a maximum of 10 feedback messages. After participants reviewed their feedback, they were allotted $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ to revise.

# 3.5. Essay scoring

W-Pal automatically asigns holisic ratings ofessay quality usig algorithms validated based on human raters (.g., Authors, xx). However, in the present study, we relied on expert human ratings of essy quality to evaluate additional subscores. The W-Pal system score was correlated $( r = 0 . 6 5$ with the holistic scores generated by the human raters. This correlation is consistent with extant work comparing human and automated scores (Authors, xxxx).

Human ratings enabled us to asess not only holistic quality, but performance based on a variety of fine-grained subscales. Specifically, trained raters asiged a holistic esay qualiy scor e Table B3 for rubric to ech eay as wel as ratings on nine separate subscales: (1) gammar, style, and mechanics, (2) word choice, (3) voice (4) sentence tructure, (5) introduction paragraph qualit, 6) body paragraph qulit, )concusion paragrah qulit, 8gantion, and (9) un (see Table B4). Note that the holistic scores a separate scale (1-6) and not a sum of the subscale scores. However, it was provided by the same rater who assgned the subscores. I is also of note that the raters have not only scored thesesays, but hundreds, if not thousands f other esays using ths same rubric for a number of related research projects.

The trained human raters included four graduate students of English. Rater pairs were trained to a high level of reliabilit (i.. all kappas $> 0 . 8 0 \dot { }$ on all metrics on practice essays. Each essay $( N = 1 4 2 8 )$ was then scored by two raters. Across raters, the reliability of ratings for unadjudicated scores (ICC) ranged from .79 to .90. If the two raters scored differed by more than 2, the scores were adjudicated by a third party. The final scores for each essay reflect the average score of the two raters.

Descriptive analyses f esay scores, collapsed acrossfeedback condition, are provided in Table B5. Unsurprisingly, holistic scores were strongly correlated with ll subscales (i.., concurrent validit). These correlations are similar to those reported in other studies using expert ratings of holistc and subscores (Crosey et al., 2014 Crossey & McNamara, 2010; Roscoe et al., 2014b). In addition, and consistent with prior research (e.g., Allen et al., 2014), reading skill was positively correlated with holistc core and subscales $( r = 0 . 4 7$ to .68). These moderate to strong correlations provide both convergent validity for our scoring rubric as well as evidence for the need to consider the effect of reading skill on essay scores.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Preliminary analyses

Exploratory t-tests indicated no difference in performance between L1 and L2 participants on holistic score and no differences on most of the subscores. The exception was for Grammar, Speling and Mechanics in which L1 participants scored higher $( M = 3 . 5 9$ $S D = 0 . 7 3$ ) than the L2 participants $( M = 3 . 4 5$ $S D = 0 . 8 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ $t ( 2 2 3 ) = 2 . 1 1$ $p = . 0 4 .$ Due to the small sample and even division of L2 participants across conditions, we do not further examine the effects of the experimental manipulation as a function of speaker status.

# 4.1.1. Use of the spelling and grammar feedback tools

An important first step was to confirm that participants used the speling and grammar tools provided by W-Pal. Participants in the Strategy $+ \thinspace s \mathbf { G }$ Condition authored more than 700 essays in total (i.e., 59 students $\times 6$ essays $\times ~ 2$ drafts). Log data revealed that spelling and/or grammar checking tools were acesed for 622 of these essays; 149 esas exhibited no evidence f using the checkers. Among these 622 cases, the spelling checker was accessed for 592 essays $( 9 5 . 2 \% )$ and the grammar checker was accessed for 378 essays $( 6 0 . 8 \% )$ . Thus, most participants used the spelling and grammar checker on multiple essays, and every participant used the checkers on more than one essay.

When participants accessed a checker, allerrors of that type (i., spelling or grammar) were visully underlined. Table B6 displays the number of errors of each type ogged by the system for (a) initial drafts and (b) revised draft. As an example, Table B7 shows the frequency of each typef error identified i the Competition and Coopertion prompt eays. The majorit of errors were pelling errors including both typographica errors (\*teh) and true missellings (Instrincly"). Notably, there were far more spelling errors than grammar errors.

# 4.1.2. Effects of spelling and grammar feedback alone

The primary focus of the study was the combination of automated strategy feedback with pelling and grammar feedback. We were neither theoreticll nor practicll inteested in the effct of selling and grammar checking in isolation. Nonetheles, we were able to investigate the potential impact of spelling and grammar alone by comparing essay quality across the two conditions for participants initil draft of their frst essy (on the topic of Images and Impressins). For this esay and draft, participants had not yet received any strategy fedback on any essy-the only source of support (in the SG condition) was the spelling and grammar checkers. Thus, this specific instance allowed us to ases benefit of selling and grammar feedback versus a \*no feedback" control case. A multivariat analysis of variance (MAnovA) tested the efect of condition on all of the scores (holitic and the nine subscores). This analyzes revealed no effec f conditio (and thus peling and grammar feedback) on any of the expert holisticor subscale rating all $F s < 1 . 0 0$ ; Table B8). This outcome sugges that spelling and grammar feedback on its own has lttle efect on essay qualit, even when examining subscales that focus on surface-level features of the essays.

# 4.2. Effects of strategy feedback $^ +$ spelling and grammar feedback

Based on prior research, there are plausible reasons to hypothesize that combining spelling and grammar support with formative strategy fedback could be detrimental (H1), beneficial (H2), or have no effect (H3) on writing quality. Thus, we conducted analyzes to examine the efets of combining fedack approaches, along with potential influences of the essay prompts and individualdifferenes.

To assessthe effects of combinin feedback approaches, along with potential effect of ifferent prompts or individual differences in reading skill we implemented a series of linear mixed efects models using the Ime4 package in R (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015). The models alow us to enter between-subjects and within-subject fied factors along with the individual student as a random factor to account for person-level variance. Specificall, we conducted separate analyzes for the holistic score and each subscale essay score as the dependent variable. The models also included (a) condition (strategy feedback, strategy $^ +$ SG) and (b) essay draft (ie., itial and revised), while contollig for (c) prompt and (d) reading ability (GMRT; see model structures in Appendix B). The Reghelper package (Hughes & R Core Team, 2017) was used to estimate simple slopes.

Unsurprisingly, reading skill was correlated with all essay scores $( r ^ { \prime } s = 0 . 3 3 - 0 . 4 9 )$ . For each essay score, a baseline model (Mo) was created, including the two covariates, GMRT and esay prompt, in order to control for the influence of reading skill $( M = 0 . 5 8$ $S D = 0 . 2 0 $ ) on writing proficiency as well s the differences that emerge as a function of prompt (Authors, xx; Huot, 1990). Model 1 (M1) added draft (initial draft and revision s fixed effcto xamine th effects of revision. Model 2 (M2) added the fixed ffect of feedback condition (Strategy and Strategy + SG), as well as draft by condition' and 'GMRT by condition' interaction terms.

Visual inspection of reidual plots did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality. For each of the models listed below, significance was determined using likelihood ratio tests between each model and a reduced model.Significant chi-square $( \chi 2 )$ tests indicate that adding the additional variable(s) improved fit as compared to the previous model. In the fllowing analyses, we report the best fiing model for each score. Thus, if main effects or interactions are not reported, they can be assumed to be nonsignificant.

Table B9 reports average essays scores, as a function of draft and condition, along with the likelihood ratio tests indicating model fit. Overall able 9 reeals that students essay scores improved from intial draft to revision in terms of the holisic score and all ut one of the suscales (unity). This reult substantiaes the value of strategy feedack and opportunitie to reise. By contrast, th effects of spelling and grammar fedback were limited to improvements in terms of mechanics (as expected) and thee of the other subscores (word choice, voice, and conclusion). These results are discussed in more detail in the following sections. The full models for each subscale are provided in Appendix B.

# 4.2.1. Holistic essay quality

To evaluate the influence of different types f feedback on overallessay score, we firs inspected the holisic core. Holistic essay quality increased significantly when participants revised (i.e., from initial to revised drat), supporting assumptions that stratey feedback and the opportunity to revise improves essay quality. There was not a significant efect of condition (Table B9). Thus, participants in both the Strategy and Strategy $^ +$ SG conditions were able to use the automated formative feedback to improve their essays. However, the availability of spelling and grammar checking tools conferred no aditional benefits. These findings support the hypothesis (H3) that adding spelling and grammar feedback to an AWE system has no discernable efects on overallessay quality

# 4.2.2. Grammar, style, and mechanics

Spelling and grammar checkers directly target spelling and grammatic erors, and thus it was unsurprising to observe a significant positive benefit for checking tols on the mechanics subscale score. Specifically, a simple slopes analys showed that Strategy $+ \thinspace s \mathrm { { G } }$ Condition participants improved significantly from initial draft to revision; Estimate $= 0 . 2 6$ $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 0 4 $ $t ( 1 2 8 3 ) = 4 . 8 6$ $p < . 0 0 1$ whereas Strategy Condition participants did not; Estimate $= 0 . 0 2$ $\mathbf { S E } = 0 . 0 4 $ $t ( 1 2 8 3 ) = 0 . 5 0$ $p = . 6 2$ Notably, Strategy $+ \thinspace s \mathbf { G }$ condition participants had aes to selling and grammar feedback during both stages of writing. The sgnificant interaction sugges that the effects of spelling and grammar feedback primarily ffected the qualit of the revision. This finding supports the hypothesis (H2) that spelling and grammar feedback contribute positively to evaluations of participants' use of grammar, style, and mechanics.

4.2.3. Writing dimensions that benefitted from spelling and grammar feedback

Although students essays did not improve holistically with the availability of checking tools, several writing dimensions did appear to benefit. The adition of condition and the interaction terms improved model fi for word choice, voice, and conclusion, subscales (organization subscores showed a similar trend, but did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance). For all three of these subscales, analyzes of the best fit models (M3) revealed significant main effct of draft (participants score improved from intia drat to revision), but no main effct of fedback condition. This was qualified by significant draft by condition interaction indicating that the effect of draft depended on feedback condition. imple slope analyses, with draft as the focal predictor and condition as the moderator, indicated that those who had aces to spelling and grammar checks tended to increase their subscale a revision (word Choice: Estimate $= 0 . 2 2$ $\mathbf { S E } = 0 . 0 4 $ $t ( 1 2 8 3 ) = 5 . 5 4$ $p < . 0 1$ ; voice: Estimate $= 0 . 2 9$ ${ \tt S E } = 0 . 0 5$ $t ( 1 2 8 3 ) = 5 . 9 7$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; conclusion: Estimate $= 0 . 3 8$ ${ \bf S E } = 0 . 0 6$ $t ( 1 2 8 3 ) = 6 . 0 7$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \check { \ } }$ . In contrast, there were no statistically significant improvements for participants in the Strategy Condition (all Estimates $< . 0 9$ $t < 2 \AA$ . These findings further support the hypothesis (H2) that spelling and grammar fedback contribute positively to some aspects of writing qualit. Notably, word choice and voice are primarily at the word level. Thus, it makes intuitive sense that these subscales would be inluenced by the availability of spelling and grammar fdback.

4.2.4. Writing dimensions that did not benefit from spelling and grammar feedback

The availability of spelling and grammar feedback did not appear to influence the Introduction, Body, and Sentence Structure suscales. Students improved on these traits from initial to revised draft, but there was no significant efect of feedback condition. Although thee pecific findings support H3 (no effect), the broader implication of the mixe results for spelling and grammar feback supports the conclusion that spelling and grammar feedback does not have uniform impact on essay writing. That i, spelling and grammar feedback supports some aspects of writing, but not all.

# 4.3. Examples of participant revising

The above analyses suggest that availabilit of spelling and grammar checking tools did not improve students essay qualit holistically or across al dimensions, but several traits apeared to enefit rom these ools: word choice, voice, the qualit of conclusion paragraphs, and essay organizatio. To more concretely llustrate how spelling and grammar feedback was (and was not) used by student writers, we provide below four authentic example essays from participants who received Strategy $+ \thinspace s \mathrm { { G } }$ feedback. These example essays were extracted from participants who demonstrated consistent improvements (e.g., larger mean gains acrossessays) on target dimensions during revising. Specifically, we targeted writers whose revisions tended to successfully improve word choice quality, voice, conclusion, or organization. These successful revisers were the most ikely to exhibi use of the spelling and grammar tools (if at ll). Importantly, these examples are not intended to provide a qualitative or mixed-method analysi (e.g., Creswell, 2013; Creswell & Clark, 2017; Saldana, 2015) that derives generalizable themes or patterns across the dataset. Rather, our purpose was to provide meaningful examples of revising that complement the depersonalized, aggregate quantitative data.

All the example essays were written on the Loyaly prompt (i.e., "Should people always maintain their loyalties or i it sometimes necessary to switch sides?") (see Appendix C). The Loyalty prompt was th fourth eay during the study. We selected this essay because participants were far enough along in the study to be suficintly familiar with the system and tools For each of the selected example essays $( n = 4 )$ , we identified (a) changes from initial draft to revised draft and (b) use of spelling and grammar feedback for essays.

# 4.3.1. Participant A

Acrossall esays, Participant A tended to demonstrate meaningful average gains (i.., increases from initial to revised draft) on the dimensions of conclusion (from Minitial $= 2 . 7 5$ to Mrevised $= 4 . 3 7$ ) and organization (from Minitial $= 3 . 5 8$ to Mrevised $= 4 . 6 2$ . That is, when revising, Participant A tended to consistently improve upon the qualit of concluding paragraphs and essay structure. On the example Loyalty essay, Participant A increased from a score of 1.5-4.5 on conclusion and from a score of 3.0-5.0 on organization. Appendix C provides the full text of the revised essay, with deletions indicated via strikethrough and additions indicated in bold.

The most substantive revisions were the elaboration of the final reason' (i., additional support) and an entirely new concluding paragraph that summarized main ideas.Inspection of lo data for the target essay revealed that Participant A ccesed feedack on five potential spelling issues (i.e, bihind," "happns" "strat" hagout," and "br) along with suggested corrections (ie, "behind," "happens, "start," hangout," and "be"). The correction of hagout" ddressed a missplld word that was retained from the initial draft. All other sugestions appeared in the new content added by the participant; and allcorrections were acepted. The participant also accesed fedback on one possible grammtica ssue (i., Who cares ifthey lagh at you was flad as a possibleinerrogatory statement), which they disregarded. The most substantive contributions the revisions that influenced human ratings of conclusion and organization-likely stemmed from the rhetorical changes rather than edits tospellig. However, seling and grammar fdback enabled the participant to beter communicate (i.., fewer typos) these added ideas. verall this student seemed to leverage spelling and grammar feedback fairly minimally, and instead allocated revisions to larger structural revisions.

# 4.3.2. Participant B

Across essays, Participant B tended to consistently improve word choice (from Minitial $= 3 . 6 7$ to Mrevised $= 4 . 8 7 $ ) and essay organization (from Minitial $= 3 . 8 3 $ to Mrevised $= 4 . 8 7 $ ) from initial draft to revision. On the target Loyalty essay, Participant B increased from a score of 4.0-5.0 on word choice and from a core of 4.0-4.5 on organization. Appendix C provides the full and anotated text of the revised essay.

Participant B implemented several revisions that potentiall improved the precision or sophistication of wording within thessay. For instance, the phrase "alittlecazy" was replaced with very haughty," the vague term \*they" was replaced with \*the person on the receiving end," "unjust way" was replaced with "oppresed manner," and the cloquial word ok" was replaced with "valid." When revising, log data showed that Participant B acesed feedback for only one spelling issue (ie., \*recieving") and one potential grammaticalissue (\*in an oppressed way"), both of which were addressed. These changes improved the wording of the essay but represent only two of the participants many revisions. Thus, for Participant B, it was unclear whether the availabilit of pelling and grammar feedback had much impact on word choice or organization.

# 4.3.3. Participant C

Across essays, Participant C tended to improve essay conclusion (from Minitial $= 2 . 1 7$ to Mrevised $= 3 . 7 5$ ) and organization (from Minitial $= 3 . 5 0$ to Mrevised $= 4 . 9 1$ ) via revising. On the target Loyalty essay, Participant C increased from a score of 1.0-4.5 on conclusion and from a score of 3.0-5.5 on organization. Appendix C provides the full and annotated text of the revised essay.

Participant C made substantive revisions via elaboration (e.g., \*This betrayal caused her mother to relize.." and \*For example, they could know the location of..), retructuring (e.g., repositioning sentences such as This sense of nationalism..), and the addition of a new concluding paragraph. Such revisions likely contributed positively to the improved subscale scores for essay organization and conclusion quality. On this esay, Participant C accessed no feedback on grammatical ssues and only one issue for spelling (i.e, bokeness"), which was resolved (ie, rokeness). Thus selling and gramar fedback during revising appeared to contribute minimally to improvement of this essay for Participant C.

# 4.3.4. Participant $D$

Across essays, Participant D tended to improve essay voice (from Minitial $= 2 . 8 7$ to Mrevised $= 4 . 1 7 \cdot$ ) and conclusion (from Mini$\mathrm { t i a l } = 2 . 2 5$ to $M \mathrm { r e v i s e d } = 3 . 5 0 $ via revising. On the target Loyalty essay, Participant C increased from a score of 2.5-4.5 on voice and from a score of 2.0-4.5 on conclusion. Appendix C provides the full and annotated text of the revised essay.

This participant implemented a variety of relatively minor revisions that improve clarity, such as correcting No matter to who is loyalty you or not you or not you should always be loyal' to No mattr who is loyal to you or not you should always be loyal. The participant als finworg, su asrlacng wl sei in h futre' owill ffect your fure, and elacing ight decisions" with correct decisions." Other revisions were mechanical, such as correcting capitalization (e.g., from  to T) or repairing sentence fragments (e.g., from Doen't have to e.."' to It doen't have to e..). In the conclusion, the participant aded a restated thesis with an exclamation point Notably, the participant never accessed grammar fdback during revision and accessed spelling feedback only once to correct "loyaly' to loyalty." That i, this participant made aditional spelling and grammar corrections that were not directly ffred by the system. Thus, although Participant D revised the essay for spelling, grammar, and other conventions, these changes did not appear to be directly elicited by the spelling and grammar checker.

# 4.3.5. Summary

Overall, these essays exemplify how spelling and grammar tools were used infrequently and contributed to incremental improvements (g., clrity and mechanical orrectness, yt were not associated with substantive gains in holistic writing quality. These illustraie examples help to visualize how the availabilit of spelling and grammar feedback was neither harmful nor strongly useful.

# 5. Discussion

Building upon the utility of word processing programs (e.g., Bangert-Drowns, 1993; Morphy & Graham, 2012), modern automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems provide computer-based support for multiple aspects of writing. Using NLP-based algorithms, AWES can asses numerous lexical, syntactic, organization, semantic, and rhtorical features of esays to evaluat overall quality and detect potential problems (Allen et al., 2016; Strobl et al., 2019). In turn, these asessments can yield actionable recommendations and strategies that learners can use to improve their writig (Authors, xx). This is important, given that prior research has etablished that formative trategy feedback is one of the most powerful components of writing instruction and writer development e.g., Graham & Perin, 2007; Parr & Timperley, 2010).

However, one assumption inherited from word processors is that AWE toos can and should assess and provide feedack on selling and grammar. Speling and grammar checkers are popular, and many educators and participants expect this functionality from AWE. Ofen, instructors and deigners assume that any opportunty to deliver fedback should be leveraged. However, t is also possible that additionl feedback can result in suboptimal effects ., Authors, xx). Ths, experimental ealuations of new feres reresent an important aspect of effective design and development of AWEs and other computer-based learning environments (Authors,xxx). Although automated spelling and grammar eror detection is relatively easy to implement, it was important for us to demonstrate that adding this feedback would not dampen or nullify the benefits of the existing AWE system.

This study explored the effects of incorporating speling and grammar checking tools within an existing AwE (i.e., W-Pal) that provides fomative strat feedback e Athrs, xx).Duehe mportance f straty fedack for goo writing, ll contions n our study included strategy feedack. The lack of a "no feedback" control limits the ability to discuss the magnitude of the effect of strategy feedack on its own, but such effects have been well-documented in prior literature. Prior writing reearch shaped three competing hypotheses. First, speling and grammar feedback might be detrimental (H1) by guiding participants attention away from conceptual aspects of writing and reinforcing their tendency to focus on superficial edits (Crawford et al., 2008; Fitzgerald, 1987. Second, speling and grammar fedback could be beneficial (H2) by helping participants correct superficial errors quickly, thus enabling or motivating them to expend more effort on deeper concerns (see Graham & Santangelo, 2014; Morphy & Graham, 2012). Finally, splling and gamr fedack might hae n effectonribing litle  ratings f writig quality (ee Crossly et al., 2014). Importantly, we explored these possbilities across not only the holistc scores, but also in terms of the subscores representing various aspects of eay quality. Overal, our reults suggest some modest enefits f pelling and grammar fedback (H2), ut largely no ffect (H3) of spelling and grammar feedback.

Notably, there was no evidece that spelling and grammar feedback decreased essay quality (H1). More specificll, the ailaility of spellig and grammar checking tools did not significantly improve holitc essay quality nor did it improve several more fine-grained dimensions of essay quality (i.e. ntroduction paragraph quality, body paragraph qualit, and sentence structure). However, analyses observed that spelling and grammar feedback appeared to modestl improve writing with respect to word choice, voice, and conclusion paragraphs, but only on the second draft.

Our results indicate that orrcting a few spelling and grammar erors had little impact on overall essay quality. This nll result is unsurprising but emphasizes the need to focus on strategy feedack rather than spelling and grammar correction. However, our study also revealed that the addition of spelling and grammar feedback did not detract from essay qualit. Students overall esay quality improved in both conditions. Thus, potential concerns that students might be overwhelmed and reect the feedack, or that they might become hyper-focused on less impactful revisions, were unfounded.

It is likely that the effects of spelling and grammar feedback on subscores (e.g., conclusion and organization) was indirect. Given that students tend to focus their revisions on mechanical errors, by quickly identifying and resolving these isues, students had more time to respond to other aspects of the feedback. For example, les skilled writers tend to skip past an extended planning phase and instead engage in knowledge teling in which they transcribe their ideas as they go in relatively linear fashion (Bereiter, Burtis, & Scardamalia, 1988). This would suggest that conclusion scores were weaker than introduction and body paragraph scores because they had les time to craft thi section in this timed task. In the 10-minute revision time, students with pelling and grammar feedback were able to easily resolve speling and grammar issues, leaving them more time to increase the length and qualit of their concluding paragraph. Indeed, this assumption is supported by the qualitative inspections.

As observed acros a few example essays, limited use of spelling and grammar checking tools helped participants produce more technically correct writing (i.e, fewer typos), but the most substantive revisions (e.g., added elaboration and arguments) seemed independent of the spelling and grammar support. Notably, actionable recommendations for improving essay structure, communication of ideas, cohesion, word choice, and so on are commonly provided by W-Pal formative fedback message see Table B2). These example eays suggest that the participants were using the formative strategy feedback to make more substantive changes above and beyond the recommendations made by the spelling and grammar checker.

Overall, such findings are most consistent with existing work demonstrating that speling and grammar fedback are not detri. mental, but that this mechanical fedback influences only a few aspects of writing (e.g., Kellgg, Whiteford, & Quinlan, 2010; Rock. 2007).

# 5.1. Implications

Our study reveld that spelling and grmar fedack on it own had no signicant ffet on essy quality (.. on the irst raft see Section 4.1.2). Although this finding is not surprising given the extant literature on writing, it runs counter to many intructors intuitions that quality writing hinges on mechanics. Our findings provide further evidence in support of formative strategy fedback.

Our log data suggested that students used the spelling and grammar tools, but not to great effect. It may be the case that students know how to navigat to use thee tools, but they may not have the knowledg or sills to be able to use thefedack efectively. us, one consideration may be for AWE systems to provide instruction on how tobest leverage speling and grammar fedback along with their instruction on more sophisticated writing strategies It is also likely that writr differentilly seek out and leverage different types of feedback. For example, Hazelton et al.(2021) found that les confident writer tended to rely on grammar tols more than their more conidnt peers.Thus, the extnt to which fedback is sought out and used  ikely relatd to indvidul dfernces in skill, motivations, and attitudes. A more comprehensive understanding of the impact of various types of feedback requires considering both prior skills as well as how the feedback is perceived and implemented.

Notably, the findings do not discount the potential benefits of spelling and grammar feedback. The availability of spelling and grammar feeback in ddition to writing stratey feeback showed no negative efects and, indeed, some modest benefits. Indeed, our findings highlight that quality writing involves mastery of both content and the language through which that content is conveyed. Developing writers are likely to need asstance with both. While the need to develop more foundational spelling and grammar knowledge and kils as well as development of knowledge of structure and content in tandem is likly aparent to writing reearchers it is not always ovious to instructors and students. The current works represents part of a growing body of research amed at a deeper understanding of how developing writers use feedback. These studies can help instructors (and AWEs) to deliver better just-i-time support that can help students to interweave quality content with good mechanics.

# 5.2. Future work

The current study was aligned with prior W-Pal research (e.g., Authors, xxx; Proske et al., 2014). Thus, the findings are constrained by the functionalities of W-Pal, such as how it permits writing and revising and how it deliers fdack. For example, W-Pal's default setting, used in this study, is to give $2 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to author an initial draft and $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to revise. Participants were unable to submit their eays before this time had elapsed. These durations and restrictions were implemented to control time-on-task (e., prevent rushing to finish). However, given the impact of slf-regulation on writing (Kellog, 2008; Kellogg & Raulerson, 2007; Santangelo et a., 2016), it isplausible that writing or revision behaviors might diffr if participants governed their own writig time. Indeed, a long history of rearh indicates that stdents do not fen take ull dvantag frvision opportuntie (Atli, 2004; Fagey  Wite, 1981), but students can and do make meaningful additions when encouraged to revise (Authors xxx). W-Pal also delivers strategy feedback only once the participant has submitted thir esay, rather than during composition- feature that appears in several other AWE systems (se Strobl et al., 2019). Thus, spelling and grammar feedback was deployed immediately, whereas stratey feedback was delayed. It would be of value to explore how changing the temporality of these two types of feedback, such as waiting to deliver spelling and grammar until ater writing is complet, deploying strategy feedack in-the-moment, or waiting to provide spelling and grammar fedack until fter larger structural and content ssues have already been addressed (e.g., Koltovskaia, 2020) might impact writing quality.

It is also worth noting that W-Pal feedback targets writing strategies that are communicated in the tutorial video lessons and practice games. Participants in this study did not reeive this writing stratey oril intuction thai partf the larger W-Paltutoring system. Future work will examine how spelling and grammar feedback is employed in the context of strategy training.

It is also important to note that the strategies highlighted in w-Pal reflect only a subset of the possible types of writing feedback. w. Pal is one of many AWE systems. As outlined previously, different AWEs provide feedback on a variet f aspects of writing, some of which are captured in W-Pal and some of which are not. Thus, one clear direction for future comparative research is to evaluate whether sellig and grammar checking tools perform differentl in AWE systems that employdifferent styles of feedback. Examining these effects in other AWEs will help to asess the generalizabilit f these findings as well as potentially important boundary con. ditions. Indeed, thesample in the current study also limits the degreeto which broad generalizations can be made. Our study includes adolescents who are predominantly native English speakers. Preliminary analyses suggested that the non-native English speakers produced essays of similar qualit, save for the grammar, spellig, and mechanics subscore. However, our sample is too small to investigate this more deeply. The finding sugests that further work should be done to examine the combination of both types of feedback for those who have more dificulty with more foundational writing skills including L2 writers and younger, developing writers.

The present study examined how spelling and grammar feedback influenced essay writig and revision in the context of a lab-based setting wherein students were provided automated feedback. Subsequently, evaluations were provided by expert raters using an established rubric. It will be of value in future work to explore these efects across other forms of esay evaluation. As mentioned previously, non-expert raters appear to value different features of esays than thir expert counterparts (e.g., Crossey et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2017). Students alo attend to different fetres than teachers when evaluating essay quality (Author, xx). lthough AWEs were built to emulat teacher feedback, there is evidence that teacher evaluation and fedback can be both qualitatively and quantitatively different from feedback provided by AWEs (e.g., Dikli & Bleyle, 2014). Thus, the effcts of automated spelling and grammar fedback may differentiall influence essay scores depending on the nature of the evaluation. Future work should examine these effects in the context of the classroom and with ecologically-appropriate evaluations.

Finally, our sample was predominantl native English-speaking. Although there is an abundance of work on spelling and grammar feedback in the context of L2/EsL writers, there is much less work specifically examining the combination of pelig and grammar feedback with strategy feedback on L2/ESL writers esay qualit. Aditional studies with larger L2/ESL samples must be conducted to examine this more directly. Such comparisons will contribute to our theoretical understanding of writing, and also help researchers and instructors to better tailor feedback to individual writers.

# 5.3. Conclusion

Although spling and grammar feedback tools are a ubiquitous part of our writing experiences, prior research on writing in. struction and assesment offered conflictig hypthes regarding the potentil effct of providing pelling and grammar fedback in concert with formative strategy feedback. Our findings sugest modes or minimal benefits of speling and grammar feedback--formative writing strategy feedback remains the important feedback support that we should provide to participant writers.

The rapid growth of AI-driven feedback shows that computers can do much more than simply detect typographical errors and spelling mistakes. However, it may be unwise to take this mechanical fedack for granted. Given the potential benefits of combining spelling and grammar feedback in concert with strategy fedback, we suggest possiblebenefit of including instruction in how to be more strategic and mindful of feedback on these errors in conjunction with instruction about deeper aspects of writing.

Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition?</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Winning</td><td>From talent contests to the Olympics to the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes, we constantly seek to reward those who are &quot;number one.&quot; This emphasis on recognizing the winner creates the impression that other competitors, despite working hard and well, have lost. In many cases, however, the difference between the winner and the losers is slight. The wrong person may even be selected as the winner. Awards and prizes merely distract us from valuable qualities possessed by</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Loyalty</td><td>others besides the winners. Do people place too much emphasis on winning? Loyalty is one of the essential attributes a person must have and must demand of others. Being loyal, faithful, or dedicated to someone or something, is not always easy. People often have conflicting loyalties, and there are no guidelines that help them decide to what or to whom they should be loyal. Moreover, people may be loyal to something harmful or bad.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Patience</td><td>Should people always maintain their loyalties, or is it sometimes necessary to switch sides? When we are young, we learn from parents and teachers that we should wait patiently for what we want. Few people would dispute the wisdom or truth of this teaching. Our society, however, with its mad rush and hurry and its insistence on instant gratification and quick responses, encourages and rewards impatience. Experience teaches us that we should not and do not have to wait. Is it better for people to act quickly and expect quick responses from others rather than to</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Memories</td><td>wait patiently for what they want? Many persons believe that to move up the ladder of succes and achievement, they must forget their past repressit, and let it go. But others have just the opposite view. They see their old memories as a chance to reckon with their past and integrate past and present. Do personal memories hinder or help people in their effort to learn from their past and succeed in the present?.</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Participant a revised essay on "loyalty"

Loyalty i something that everyone should have right? But sometimes you get betrayed by your best friend and you think the best thing to do is to not be loyal to them anymore. However that i not true; sometimes betrayal is the right thing to do because you might find something that they might like to do things that they force you get dragged into, they could be forcing you to do something, and you might find out that they are talking behind your back and leave them.

To start off your buddy might like to do things that you get dragged into. For example, they might like to go on roller coasters and you don't but you have to because you are scared that they will make fun of you. used to be scared that my friends would make fun of me because I didnt really like to do the things they did or didnt like the same things I liked. Most f the time I would just stay quiet While my friends talked their ies away. Then I saw some kids bring toys and I saw that had some f them and I was no longer afraid to show what I liked to do.

The next reason is that they might force you to do things you don't want to do. Sometimes friends may be abusive and this is when you turn the other way. Just say no and if they keep pushing then don't hangout with them anymore. There was a time when somebody told me to play with them and then they told me to do something bad and I told them no. They kept asking me whenever 1 came close to them so I just stopped going towards them and I have never seen them again.

The final reason is that they could be talking behind your back. Sometimes after you reject someone, they might start talking behind you back or telling people bad things about you. If this ever happens, don't do the same thing. Just ignore and if someone comes up to you with something bad about you, prove them wrong and move on with your own life.

In conclusion, don't be pushed around by your peers. If you don't like something that they do and you don't, just tell them and leave. Who cares if they laugh at you. t is your own life to live and nobody's busines. Loyalty is great but sometimes you have to go the other way because you may not like something they do, they could be forcing you into things, and they might be talking behind your back.

Participant B revised essay on "loyalty"

Loyalty is one of the main character traits people look for in a companion. It is what makes friendships and relationships last so long. It is what makes  person feel comfortable with others, and with loylty usually comes trust as well But, n some instances loyalty is hard to maintain. When afriend has wronged their other friend, when a person makes choices others do not agree with and when people drift away from each other. In those cases, it is easy to lose sight of being loyal.

People have fought with thir friends or significant others since the dawn of time. But sometimes these disputes just go too far. If a person has back stabed their friend and sill expect complete forgivenes, they must be avery haughty. If a person has continuously told lies to their sigificant other, the odds are the person on the receiving wl leave the picture. Pople do not enjoy being treated poorly or in an oppressed manner. People will not stand for that at al. These types of events create ripples in relationships that are sometimes more deep than trying to stay loyal to someone.

In other cases, the loyalty dispute i one sided. If someone has friend that starts to pick up habits that they believe are wrong, it is hard o continue to be in their lives. For example, if afriend strted abusing drug it would be hard to stay with them especially if they are refusing help. Just lik in dating, there are certain deal breakers people have that make them question their loyalty in friendships. If the action a friend is doing puts someone in a compromising situation or in any ort of danger, t is valid to switch sides and leave them. Sometimes it is about looking after one self rather than somebody else.

A lot of the time people ose interest in each other. They do not start relationships with that thought i mind, but it does happen. It is human nature. Whether it is because the duo went to different schools, got new jobs, or just made new friends it does happen. When this occurs, it is easy to forget the friendships $\overbar \cdot$ and relationships and move on. People get more concerned with themselves and put others on the back burner causing them to drif away. In turn, they lose the feelings and thoughts they once had for the other person, and it is easy to not stay loyal.

Loyalty is touchy subject for most people. It i a trait that someoneether has or does not aquire. Although, it is important ostay loyal to the ones that are close to someone, it is understandable t switch sides occasionall. If someone has cratd problems for them, back stabbed them or just grown apart, it is valid to not be loyal anymore.

Participant C revised essay on "loyalty"

Whether it is being loyal to a specific coffe hop or to the deepest secrets of one's company, loyalty can be a difficult attribute to maintain. The aspects of loyalt are complex; therefore, many individuals have a diffcult time staying loyal. Sometimes it is necessay to switch sides, so people should not be held accountable for not being loyal.

Exclusivity is a prominent component of the majorit of uccessful, long-term marriages. Ofte, a pouse's interests and personality alters. When this change is so significant that one spouse fees unfamiliar with the other, divorce occurs and the mutual loyalty that once was is shattered. For example, when I was in eighth grade, my bes friend's parents began arguing. The disagreements escalated until they ultimately divorced. In the end I was informed that the reason they separated was because her father was having an affair. This betrayal caused her mother t realize the brokenness in her husband. When loyalty i not earned or deserved, it isacceptable and necessary to switch sides.

During the time of kings and queens, loyalty to a certain religion meant lif or death. Unlike America's limitles freedoms, people could not frely worship what they pleased. In Spain, Catholicism was prominent, as apposed to paganism and Christianity. Groups formed secretly to pray and worship against orders of the royal court. They could be named trators of the king and be beheaded if exposed. If someone truly believes that their spiritual loyalty lies elsewhere, switching sides is important to their moral being

The United States Military, FBI, and CIA are known for their stellr commitment and unbreakable loyalty. This sense of nationalism can cost them their lives. f soldier or agent is kidnaped as a prisoner of war, t is citial for them to maintain loyalty for the sake of their country. For example, they could know the location of  the commander in chief or the codes to a sealed file. It is necessary for them to break their loyalty to improve the quality of their well-being and prevent their demise.

The complexities of loyalty goes beyond ",right"; or",wrong". People can have conflicting loyalties and switch sides if the circumstances call for it. Faith for a religion, country, or person can change, because nothing is truthfully constant.

Participant D revised essay on "loyalty"

People should always be loyal. That is how you build trust. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone that isn't loyal. No matter Who is loyal to you or not you should always be loyal. Loyal can be something huge and hard to keep. But if you do keep loyalty trust me that will cause huge positive impacts in your life. As well as saying good things about you. People will always look at you as an admiring person as well. Who doesn't want to be admired. I believe everyone at some point wants to be admired. This includes me I would want to be admired maybe not now but inthe future. But t all depends with my loyalty now and in the resent. What you do now everyone willffect your future. The past reflects in the future a lot. It doesn't have to be right away but trust me it wil.

I always admire loyal people. Loyal people are smart because they choose to be loyal and that is great thing todo. I have to accet I think  I am pretty loyal personally. Even if wasn't loyal I would probably think of the consequences. I am pretty good at choosing things like being loyal. That is why Id rather stay loyal. lus good consequences come from correct decisions. Even if you choose to be loyal you will have a positive future. No matter what I will always stay loyal. That i like the best decision to make.

People always wants to be surrounded by loyal people. Nobody wants someone fake near them including me  I want someone positive in my lif. The not loyal people can cause harm and I don't want that. I want the positive things by my side only which is loyalty known as loyal people. The not loyal people can cause bad things. Plus it int that hard to be loyal to everyone. The hard thing in being loyal is commitment. Don't take the risk on people and surround yourself with loyal understanding people. People should maintain loyalty!.
