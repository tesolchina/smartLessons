# 1. Introduction

International graduate students enter the university with a wealth of experiences, knowledge, accomplishments, skill, identities values and languages (Palmer, 2016), but having to negotiate a new cultural, academic and inguistic environment may prove to be a challenge. With the transition that universitie have made to online and distance learning in the wake of the coviD-19 pandemic, many intenational students also reportedly lac trong support networks, and are experiencing a heightened sense of loneliness and isolation (Beckstein, 2020; Wilzewski et al., 2021). Academic language support for international students often takes the form of short-term English as a Second Language (ESL) or English for Academic Purposes (EAP) programs outside their regular coursework Despite the provision of these programs, studies have shown that the academic language neds of intenational students, particularly at the graduate level, are stil not met (e.g., Lin & Scherz, 2014). EAP experts have suggested that academic language support for international students should be integrated within the courses that students take, so that they learn the disciplinary discourse of their field and apply the language kill and literacies that they develop acos their programs (Arkoudis & Starfield, 2007; D Maria, 2020). Liu (2011) and Kim (2011) add that communities of practice (CoPs), which are \*groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and lern how to do it bettr as they interact regularly" (Wenger, 2006, p.1) can provide acollaborative context for students to develop the academic language and literacies required in their programs, while building strong networks of support.

A review of 416 empirical articles published in the Jounal of English for Academic Purposes recently (Riazi et a., 2020) showed that most EAP research has generall focused on undergraduate students. Riazi t al. recommend that more research be conducted among other categories of students in both in-person and online environments. Our research addresses this recommendation by examining how international graduate students can be supported in their academic language development through online and hybrid CoPs. The research questions underpinning our study were:

1. What are the benefits of participating in an online or hybrid community of practice for international graduate students? 2. How does participation in an online or hybrid community of practice support international graduate students in developing the academic language and literacies required in their graduate programs?

# 2. Theoretical framework & literature review

# 2.1. Sociocultural theory and communities of practice

This study was informed by sociocultural theory, which views learning as a process that is constructed through an individual's participation in social relationships and interactions within a situated context (Vygotsky, 1978). In line with sococultural theory, Lave and Wenger (1991) propose that learning occurs through one's participation in CoPs. Acording to Wenger-Trayner and Wenger-Trayner (2015), CoPs are characterized by three elements: domain, community, and practice. Firstly, members of a CoP share the same domain of interest, and they value and learn from the collctive competence of their CoP members. Secondly, CoP members participate in joint activities and discussions, exchange information, and assist each other as they pursue their domain together. Thirdly, CoP members are practitioners who develop a shared repertoire of tools, experiences and ways to addressproblems in thir practice. A leaner's participation in a CoP may start peripherally but increases graduall i complexity and engagement. As learners interact more regularly, their knowledge and expertisein a particular area are depened. Thus, Wenger (2006) decribes community of practice as a \*living curriculum" (p. 4) which engages learners in "collective learning" (p. 1).

Research has indicated that international graduate students face difficulties when socializing and adapting into their academic communities, such as lack of opportunities to interact and build relationships with peers outside their irst language or cultural groups (Faez & Karas, 2019), diffrential welcome and treatment by the programs (Lan, 2018), and unfamiliarity with the norms and discourses of the new academic communities (Kim, 2011). Strategies for supporting students' academic socialization include facilitating interactions with peers (Cho, 2013; Kim, 2011) and building strong social and academic communities with peers across various lin guistic and cultural groups (Faez & Karas, 2019). Several studies have applied the CoP model as a theoretical and pedagogical framework to examine how to support academic socialization and the development of academic language and literacies among international students. For example, Palmer's study (2016) explored the learning experiences of international graduate students from different faculties in a Canadian universit as they progressed from student to cholar in their various disciplines (p. 22). Palmer's findings suggest that their lerning did not occur solely in the classroom, but through the multilayered practice of observing and being mentored by peers in their new academic CoPs. Also informed by a CoP framework, Lan's (2018) study on international graduate students' academic English socialization in Taiwan found that students benefited through the knowledge sharing, language practice, and emotional support they received from peers with shared linguisic and cultural backgrounds in their cademic communities. Kim's (2011) and Cho's (2013) reearch on graduate casses in the U.S. suggests, however, that students participation in their graduate CoPs and their MA TEsOL academic CoPs respectively was legitimized or constrained by factors such as their language proficiency, fa miliarity with the classroom cultures, the availabilit of supportive interactions and feedback, and membership and identity.

Feedback is a crucial component of CoPs that contributes to international students' success (Hyland & Hyland, 2019; McCarthy & Dempsey, 2017; Ravichandran et al., 2017; Sloan et al. 2014). Aording to Engebretson et al. (2008), graduate students require feedback that \*challenges, invites, corrects and provokes students to improve their research and communication' (p. 8). Studies suggest that feedback from instructor alone i often reeived too late or i percived as inadequate (Spear, 2000). To mee students need for more comprehensive and timely feedback, researchers have advocated various pr feedback models. In Yang's (2016) study, graduate English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students in a universty of science and technology in Taiwan provided and received peer feedback on summary writing in an online learning community. The study found that using an online per feedback model enabled students to transform and construct new academic knowledge about academic writing, helped them understand and learn new perspectives, and enhanced their critial thinking and language awareness. Other studies have similarly confirmed that among thediverse forms of peer feedback, online feedback (i.e., provided through threaded discussion forums, blog posts, and computer-supported collaborative learning platforms) is particularly popular among international students and is beneficial to them. McCarthy's (2017) study found that compared to domestic students who mostly preferred face-to-face feedback from their professors, international students i a Bachlor of Media Arts program mostly preferred online per feedback s it allowed for ongoing and frequent feedback to be given and received at any time, provided the opportunity for them to develop their written communication skills, and created a more inclusive environment where they could interact with their peers with les social inhibitions and language barriers.

# 2.2. Academic language and literacies

The analysis in this study was guided by Scarcellas (2003) framework for academic English Scarcella (2003) poits that academic English i not a fixed construct and canot be acquired once and for all Rather, she suggests that language is dynamic and constantly evolving within educational contexts that themselves are changing, and thus students must continuously learn new language skill and literacies to meet the demands of the developing disciplines that they are in. Scarcella (2003) proposes a conceptual framework for the development of academic language and literacies which includes \*multiple, dynamic, inter-related competencies" (p. 7). These competencies are categorized into three dimensions and sub-components, as captured in Table 1 below.

In proposing the framework above, Scarcella(2003) asserts that students are capable of being \*multi-literate, multicultural and multidialectical (p. 31) individuals who can learn the various dimensions of academic English without rejecting their own home languages and cultures, and the norms and values associated with them. Affrming and incorporating students' diverse languages, cultures and identities in higher education is particularly important because many international students have expressed that their experiences, knowledge and identities are not valued by their academic communities (Her, 2005). George Mwangi et a. (2019) found that African international graduate students at a U.S. university had limited opportunities to show their multiple identities and could "only present one social identity at a time (p. 58) as people around them tended to see them one-dimensionally. Hsieh (2006) emphasizes that critical thinking is essential in helping international students examine critically how their identities are constructed or constrained in higher education, so that they do not \*passively acept their given identities and pursue a complete assimilation" (p. 877). Her (2005) sugests that students fel empowered when their past, present and future experiences and identities are integrated into their learning. In line with this, Zhang (2011), a former international student in Canada, writes that it was only when her professors \*inspire [d] my identit investment" (p. 54) in her writings that she developed confidence in her own academic writing abilities.

Language proficiency is also strongly related to identity construction among international graduate students. Studies have indicated that students comfort with using English for communication is corrlated with their adaptation to their graduate community and acquisition of disciplinary knowledge (Cho, 2013; Park, 2016), and that developing English language proficiency can help international graduate students interact with peers more efectively (Palmer, 2016). Factors such as students oral language proficiency and academic writing skill can also significantly inluence the way faculty and peers perceive them (George Mwangi et al., 2019; Hsieh, 2006; Zhang, 2011). For example, Hsieh (2006) reported that Chinese international students were \*assigned a deficient identity (p. 871) by their American peers due to their percived lack of oral English proficiency. While it i important for intenational students to develop the English language skill necessary to participate in classroom activities, tis must not come at the cost of thir linguistic identitie. In Liu's (2011) journey as an intenational graduate student in Canada, doing voluntary Mandarin teaching made her feel that I have reclaimed my identity . my \*identit isrespected'" and my Chinese-language resource is valued" (p. 83). This underscores the important relationship between the affrmation of students' first language resources and their identities.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Course description

This study was conducted in a for-credit graduate-level course for Master of Education (MEd) students in a language education program at a major public universty in Canada. The course, which was taught by Rajendram (Author 1), ook place from January to April 2020 and involved $^ { 1 2 } \ 3 \mathrm { - h }$ classes. The classes took place in person from January to February. At the start of the COvID-19 pandemic in March, the course transitioned to an online mode, with synchronous classes on Zoom, and asynchronous discussions on the university learning platform, CoLearn (pseudonym). The course, AR416: Academic English Through Research, was designed in response to the perceived need among profesors and students in the university to improve instruction and resources for graduate students whose frst or dominant language was not English. The course combined training in EAP with discipline-related content in second language acquisition (SLA) and language education. Students learned about and practised their academic reading, writing, listening and speaking skill, and academic literacies (e.g., note-taking, research literacy, time management, etc.) using scholarly articles, books, videos and other materials on topics related to the language education discipline (e.g., multilingualism, theories of language learning, translanguaging, language teaching, educational research, action research, etc.).

As their culminating task for the course, each student designed an action research project in which they slf-identified an area of academic English they wished to develop, formulated research questions, found resources and strategie to help them improve in that area, and created a plan which they put into action over thee months. Students asessed their own progres throughout their action reearch usi inms such s chcklist ubric, qu a joua rfletios.ollowing thir smets d reflctions, hey identified changes they needed to make to thir strategies, spoke to their peers to get suggestions, and made changes to their existing plan to improve it, if necessary. In the second week of the course,students were put into CoPs with pers who had similar action research goals. Over the course of 11 weeks, students worked in their CoPs to support each other through their ction reearch project.

# 3.2.  Communities of practice

There were five CoPs in this course, each with four to six students who shared the same general focus area(s) or domain of interest for their action research proects. Students within each group also had specific individual goals related to the focus area(s), and they were responsible for overseeing and supporting each ther's progres throughout their ction reearch proects. They d this by eting goals for their collaboration, and meeting with their CoPs during class and outside class hours. Students spent about 20-30 min each class session working with their CoPs, and they spent $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 \ \operatorname* { m i n }$ on average every week meeting with their CoPs outside class hours. Some groups collborated synchronously and asynchronously online via CoLearn, Zoom, Skype, and apps such as WeChat and WhatsApp, whil other groups collaborated using a hybrid model (which included a combination of face-to-face meetings, online synchronous metings, and online asynchronous discussions). Students were encouraged by the course instructor to discuss course readings, share resources and materils with ach ther related to ther focus area(s), exchange information, assin tass to each ther, report their progressto the group, review each other's work, and provide fedback and general support to each other as they pursued their area of interest together. When they needed advice or support with their collaboration, the instructor was readily available to meet with students in their groups. Table 2 below presents an overview of the CoPs.

# 3.3. Focal participants

Out of the 23 students who consented to participate in the study, seven students were selected as focal participants for this paper. We established three criteria for their selection. Firs, we selected students who had diverse backgrounds, goals and action research plans. Second, we ensured that at least one student was selected from each CoP. Thirdly, we selected students from each CoP who had interacted frequently with their CoP members so that the data collected from the selected students would provide a good representation of the whole group activities and dynamics. Table 3 presents detailed information on the seven focal participants.

# 3.4. Data collection and analysis

All of the artefacts and materials produced or shared by participants in their CoP folders on CoLearn were collected as data for the study, including written posts $( 1 7 . 7 \% )$ , discussion threads $( 4 2 . 4 \% )$ , video and audio clips $( 6 . 9 \% )$ , images $( 4 . 9 \% )$ , documents $( 1 7 . 7 \% )$ and links/other materials $( 1 0 . 4 \% )$ . The video and audio clips were transcribed. All of the artefacts and materials were entered into a spreadsheet and analyzed as separate entries, and there were 462 individual data entries in total.

We used both inductive and deductive procedures for the data analysis. We started by reviewing Scarcella's (2003) framework of academic English (see Table 1) and the literature related to our reearch questions, and generating a lis of initil codes and categories inductively (i., from the reiew of literatre) and deductively (i., from the dimensions and components in Scarcell's framework). We selected and analyzed 20data entries using these codes and categories independently. We then compared our analysis, and refined and merged overlapping codes to ensure consistency in our subsequent analysis. Next, Shi (Author 2) used the revised is of codes and categorie to analyze the data entries from one participant at a time, taking note of interesting examples and questions that required discussion. The two authors met to discus Shi's questions, and to come to an agreement on the coding of data for each participant. We repeated the analytical procedure with all seven participants, with an interrater reliability of $9 8 \%$ The recursive analytical process produced a final list f four broad categories: 1) academic language; (2) feedback; (3) identities; and (4) academic socialization (see Appendix). After the coding process was complete, we conducted descriptive statistical analysis to calculate the frequencies and percentages of each code in the data. The results of the qualitative and quantitatie analyses are presented deductively in the following section, according to the four broad categories and selected codes under each category.

# 4. Results & discussion

The results of our study demonstrate that students participation in online and hybrid CoPs benefited them and supported their development of academic language and literacies in the following ways: (1) by giving them the oportunities to practise and develop the linguistic and cognitive dimensions of aademic English (Scarcell, 2003); (2) facilitating the giving and reeiving of constructive peer feedback; (3) affirming their diverse identities and (4) providing a safe and supportive pace for academic socializatio. In the following sections, each of these themes is expounded and discussed with selected codes and examples from the data.

4.1. Practising and developing the linguistic and cognitive dimensions of academic English

# 4.1.1. Linguistic dimension

The linguistic dimension of academic English comprises five components: phonological, lexical, grammatical, sociolinguistic, and discourse (Scarcell, 2003). Our analysis revealed that students practised and supported one another's learning of ll five of these components in their CoPs, to varying extents. Fig. 1 below presents the results of the quantitative analysis of data within the linguistic dimension. The percentage against each component in the graph represents how frequently that specific component was coded in the overall data set for the linguistic dimension of academic English. In this overall data, $3 2 . 9 \%$ came from discussion threads, $2 1 . 8 \%$ from documents, $1 8 . 4 \%$ from written posts, $1 2 . 4 \%$ from links and other materials, $8 . 5 \%$ from video or audio clips, and $6 . 0 \%$ from images.

As seen in the figure above, students most ften worked on their discourse competence, followed by their lexical competence, then grammatical, then sociolinguistic then phonological. In the following sections, we present an example to ilustrat students practice and development in each of these five components.

Discourse competence. At the beginning of her research project, Zoey, who was working on improving her persuasive writing, used very few discourse features in her writing. In her persuasive essay from Week 4, she did not use any paragraphs in her essy, and there were only a few transitions and organizational signals ("on the one hand," "on the other hand," to elaborate on"). One of Zoey's CoP members encouraged her to add paragraphs to the essy, It would be bettr if the paper can be divided into multiple paragraphs." Another CoP member suggested to Zoey that she make her position clearer to readers and provide evidence o support her position, consistent with the features of the persuasive writing genre:

"You seem to have focused on stated the two opposing views on corrctions for accuracy with litl focus on your position. If you are writing a persuasive essay, the focus of the essay needs to be on supporting your argument or position. It is good that you have knowledge of both opposing claims. However, state your position clearly and focus on finding supporting evidence for your position. Such evidence can be studies done on students' writing that can prove your point, research or authors opinions."

Zoey took the suggestions of her CoP members seriously, and in her subsequent writing, began incorporating the discourse features recommended by her peers into her persuasive essays. In Zoey's essay in Week 7, Zoey included a strong thesis statement and topic sentences in her esay, used more varied organizational signals and transition words such as however", \*since", and "although," and supported her arguments with evidence from research and her own experience, thus demonstrating a greater knowledge of the discourse features of the genre of academic writing.

Lexical competence. A student who demonstrated growth in her lexical competence was Olva, whose goal was to practise her paraphrasing skill by reading and summarizing articles in writing for her CoP members. Earlier on in her project, Olva used more generic synonyms in her paraphrases. For example, in the following excerpt from Week 4 of the course, she paraphrased a sentence from the original text by changing "commonly" to "widely," "enable' to "allow," and "by means of' to "via":

Original: Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is a generic term now commonly used for a variety of systems that enable people to communicate with other people by means of computers and networks.

Paraphrased: Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is now widely used as a generic term for a variety of systems that allow people to communicate with other people via computers and networks.

One of Olva's CoP members suggested that she should use a greater variety of paraphrasing strategies, to avoid \*copy [ing] chunks of words or phrase from source texts. Her pe sugested that lva could change the sentence structure and use diffrent conecting words" and \*change key terms or proper nouns while paraphrasing." In subsequent paraphrasing exercises, Olva took up her CoP members sugestion by using more paraphrasing strategies that demonstrated an improved knowledge of the forms and meanings of words, and parts of speech. In the example from Week 7 below, Olva used more advanced synonyms (i.e., changing \*potential' to "capacity", flexible to verstile", and \*otentially richer' to theoretclly greater), and she also reordered the sentence correctly

Original: Thus, the potential for interaction in a CMC system is both more flexible and potentially richer than in other forms of computer-based education.

Paraphrased: In a CMC programme, the capacity for interaction is thus both more versatile and theoretically greater than in other types of computer-based training.

Srammatical Competence. An example of growth in grammatical competence came from Tara, who aimed to improve her abilit to write short summaries of articles. In earlier versions of the summaries that Tara wrote, there were many grammatical ssues in her writing. Tara received detailed fedback on her grammar from her CoP members. Throughout the course of her action reearch project, Tara also tried to develop her metalinguistic awareness by completing grammar exercises and learning how to proofread and edit her own work. As a result of Tara's efforts, and the continued feedback and instruction she received from her CoP members on various aspects of grammar, Tara demonstrated improved grammatical accuracy in her writing and also her speaking. In Tara's inal report, she described the strategies she used to work on her grammar, and the grammatical improvements she was able to make.

Sociolinguistic competence. Our findings showed that working in CoPs with members of various inguistic and cultural backgrounds provided students with opportunities to develop their awareness of sociolinguistic and sociocultural differences, sociocultural cues, colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions, and politenes conventions. Students supported their peers development of socioinguistic competence in several ways. For example, responding to an essay written by Husna on the topic of curfew (see section 4.2.2), her CoP members reminded her of the importance of writing with the audience and social context in mind. Upon receiving those comments, Husna wrote the following:

Thank you for asking me the important question of who is my audience. I never think this before. It really help me to better adjust my paper considering my audience and the related examples. As you point out that supporting evidences in this article may not suitable to all societies."

Students also learned new colloquial expressions through the resources they shared with each other in their CoPs. For example, a member in Mia's CoP shared with the group a bilingual YouTube video (htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mEJ1iu3KLw) explaining the meanings of colloquial and idiomatic English expressions such as "You don't want to do that, He can't help himself" 'See where I'm coming from," and "It doesn't hurt to."

Phonological competence. Allof the students whose action reearch project focused on developing their oral language demonstrated improvements in their phonological competence. Jane's goal was to learn how to express her ideas more logiall and clearly in oral presentations. To achieve this goal, she recorded weekly podcasts on a range of academic topics such as multilingualism to popular topics such as caffeine beverages. After recording a podcast on the topicof offe and sharing her podcast with her CoP members, Jane received the following feedback from her CoP member:

"Hi Jane! Love your topic this week as I am a total coffee lover:P I really enjoy the pace and tone of your talk, very soothing as usual. The only minor thing that might need to be adjusted is the pronunciation of "breath breathe least caffeine" The"e sounds here was a bit on the shorter side and would be a lot clearer if lengthened.

In Jane's following podcast on scaling and dental health, her course instructor noted that she had improved her pronunciation of the long e sound/i:/that was pointed out by her per, for example, in words such as procedure/prsi:d/ teeth/ti0/, and fre/fri:/.

# 4.1.2. Cognitive dimension

Our analysis drawn from the related data ( $2 3 . 1 \%$ from discussion threads, $2 2 . 1 \%$ from documents, $1 8 . 3 \%$ from written posts, $1 7 . 9 \%$ from links and other materials, $1 1 . 7 \%$ from video or audio clips, and $6 . 9 \%$ from images) (see Fig. 2 below) revealed that the majority of students' CoP activities and interactions in the cognitive dimension focused on developing strategic competence, for example through the use of the cognitive and metacognitive strategies listed below:

Reading: outlining, paraphrasing, idea mapping, identifying key ideas, highlighting   
$\bullet$ Writing: brainstorming, providing examples, citing evidence   
$\bullet$ Oral communication: posing questions, anticipating and answering questions, establishing themselves as authorities

Students' interactions also provided evidence of a growing knowledge base which included both declarative knowledge (knowing that) and procedural knowledge (knowing how). The declarative knowledge that students acquired was wide-ranging and covered topics such as philoophy,assessment, translanguaging, and multilingualism. Students gained this knowledge by sharing resources

# Research Aim/Question

The purpose of this research is to show how paraphrasing as a strategy can be combined with a translingual approach to instruct students explicitly on how to read and comprehend texts

# Theoretical Framework

due to the unprepared nature of a large section of students entering the Higher Education system, a number of students have been found to lack basic literacy skills such as reading for comprehension.A plethora of studies has been conducted locally and internationally with the

aim of finding solutions to help students who struggle with text comprehension, especially at university level.

# Research Methodology

Approach

Using a group of first-year multilingual medical students, this research included translanguaging as an additional component to the use of paraphrasing as a reading comprehension strategy

Data Collection

Qualitiative using participants'writing

# Participants

Using a group of first-year multilingual medical students,

# Main Findings

the importance of allowing students to utilise their multilingual repertoires is emphasised and reiterated, through translanguaging in order to enhance learning.

# Relevance to Thesis

Languages are interconnected and using translanguaging can help L2 learners better comprehend text.

with one another, taking notes ontheseesources, crting presentations for their CoP members, and through their general intractions in the group. Fig. 3 below is an example of Georgia's research notes based on an article on translanguaging (Hungwe, 2019). In her notes, Georgia extracted the main ideas related to the theory of translanguaging from the article (thus, acquiring declarative knowledge on translanguaging), and also identified how translanguaging could be combined with paraphrasing as a strategy for reading and comprehending texts (thus, acquiring procedural knowledge about how to apply translanguaging in academic reading)

In the higher order thinking category, students developed skills such as interpreting and synthesizing information, evaluating ideas criticaly, distinguishing fact from opinion, speaking and writing persuasively, and supporting ideas with evidence. In another notetaking practice based on an article on academic reading strategies, Georgia was able to summarize and synthesize the strategies outlined in the article and reflect critically on how the trategies apply to her own teaching and learning (see Fig. 4 below).

Metalinguistic awarenes was developed through activities such as reflecting on their own language through self-assessments choosing correct word forms to use in their speech or writing, thinking about the similaritie and diferences across languages, and proofreading and editing their own work or their pers' work. While editing their peers' work, students often drew their peers' attention to specific language features of their oral communication or writing that could be improved, and provided feedback that raised their metalinguistic awareness of these features. Responding to an essay written by Husna, Georgia wrote:

You've got a well structured essay where each paragraph clearly starts with a topic sentence and includes specific supporting points. I would suggest you check the collocation of certain phrases such as "lack of healthy consciousness" "changed by persons", "objective reasons'" I am guesing you meant t say "lack of awarenessof healthy practices" "changed by individuals" "valid reasons."

Husna incorporated Georgia's suggestions in her revised essay and noted in her reply that she had consciously paid more attention to her use of collocations this time.

# 4.2. Giving and receiving constructive peer feedback

Peer feedback was a crucia component that failitated students collaborative practices both online and offline, and contributed to all of the linguistic and cognitive developments outlined in the previous section. Students invited and provided fedback on each ther's practice piees on CoLearn, WeChat, Zoom, and in person. The content of their feedback was not confined to linguisic aspects but covered a wide range of components. Fig. 5 lists the types of feedback that students gave each other, and their corresponding percentages. In this data, $6 9 . 7 \%$ came from discussion threads, $1 3 . 1 \%$ from documents, $8 . 6 \%$ from written posts, $3 . 5 \%$ from video or audio clips, $3 . 4 \%$ from images, and $1 . 7 \%$ from links and other materials.

# 4.2.1. Feedback on language

Sloan et al. (2014) have suggested that peer feedback can serve as a medium through which students acquire detailed and constructive feedback on their academic writing. Students in CoPs provided feedback on language to each other through various mediums. An example of detailed feedback on language can be een in Fig. 6 below, which shows the feedack provided to Olva by her CoP member on her paraphrasing practice on the CoLearn platorm. The eedback was taken up by Olva in her next weekly practice, in which she made improvements in her phrase selection and grammatical structures which made her paraphrased content clearer to readers.

Although writte feedback on CoLearn was the most common way for students to provide feedack to each other, they also gave in time, in-person feedack on each thers languag practice during ther ffline group activitie. One of the strategie that Macy's group used to practisetheir conversational skill was by meeting up each week to play oral storytelling games, with a different grammatical focus each time. The following is an excerpt from a recording of one of their sessions':

Macy: So, I got these two cards ["time traveler" and \*member of clergy"] and I'm gonna combine them together. So, it is a time traveller who is   
Student 2: Was $=$   
Student $3 \colon =$ Past tense, who was   
Macy: Okay, so he's a time traveller who was a member of clergy.

As the main objective of the storyteling activity was to practice speaking using the past tense, when Macy started to create her story, her peers paid close attention to her use of tenses and noticed her mistake. They corrected Macy's sentence immediately and reminded her to use the past tense in her story. This led to Macy using the past tense correctly in her subsequent sentence.

While in most cases, students accepted all the suggestions on language that they received from their peers as discussed in the sections above, there were also cases where they adopted the suggestions selectively based on the compatibilit of the feedback with their action research goals. As shown below, in response to the feedack Mindy rceived on her pronunciation - \*Your intonation in English is stillike your mother tongue . perhaps you'd love to improe it by reading aloud native English films" - Mindy expressed her gratitude to her per but explained that her priority was to focus on content, inthe context of the limited time she had for her action research project:

Thank you for your comments and suggestions. A year and a half were too limited for international graduate learning. There are too many aspects I need to improve in my presentation, but at present, I want to focus on improving the expression of content. So when I make a presentation, my brain always thinks about what I should say, and sometimes I can't take into account pronunciation. Thank you for your feedback on my pronunciation, next time I will pay more attention and work hard to improve it."

Like Mindy, stets dd nt accet all the fack they recived uncriticlly, but rather, they criticlly ealuated and act on the advice based on their individual goals and priorities. This supports Scardamalia and Bereiter's (2006) recommendation that collaborative learning encourages graduate students to engage in negotiation and critical thinking. However, in this case, Mindy did not use the opportunity to critically reflect on and respond to the native-speakerism in her peer's feedback.

Fig. 6. Feedback on Olva's paraphrasing practice.

# 4.2.2. Feedback on content

Students also evaluated the content of their peers' practice pieces and provided feedback from a readers or listener's perspective In the excerpt below, Georgia provided feedback on an argumentative piece written by Husna on the topic of curfew for teenagers:

"As a reader who is not from the area you come from,I til se th ide f enforcing a curfew on tnagers difficult to imagine in everyday life unless there is a national emergency like someone is deliberately hunting young adults and there are uncon. trollablenumber of casualties. I would stil say that you need to consider what audience is this piece written for. A tenager in Canada starts work at the age of 14-16; many of them move out of their parents house by the age of 18 to live on their own as adults going to post-secondary education, so why would a curfew be enforced on teenagers in a peaceful country like Canada. Many of your supporting arguments might not seem convincing to a foreign audience. Therefore, if you for example, provide background information about the place and situation that would demand a curfew such as Corona Virus spread of any other crisis, then the argument might be more valid.

In her fedback, Georgia focused on the content of Husna's essy, and suggested that Husna should contextualize her arguments, as he contexts in which teenagers are situated, and the need for a curfew policy, differ across countries.

The feedback on content that the students inthis study received from their peers helped them identify areas for improvement tha were otherwise difficult to see when engaging in the practice on their own. In Husna's reply to Georgia, she noted:

"I really appreciate your detailed background knowledge about teenagers in Canada. Based on what you shared with me, looking back into my essay I find it quite true that in a peaceful country like Canada, the curfew police may seem useless in regard to the safety of teenagers. Thank you for your second turn to help me figure out this reality and I will bear in mind this key critical thinking method in later writing process."

As Husna's reply to Georgia indicated, peer feedback can help students recognize the blind spots in their content, which may be difficult to detect when working alone, and to construct new knowledge (Yang, 2016).

# 4.2.3. Feedback on organization

While evaluating their peers' work students also provided feedack on the organization of their peers writing or peaking practice. Below is the feedback Jane received from her CoP member on her presentation structure:

"I have a personal suggestion as well. At the beginning of the talk, you can avoid using first in the introduction of scaling because you don't have a second or third. You can just introduce the concept, which would appear more natural. I like your method of taking some notes and talk according to your notes. Maybe I can learn from your method."

This student noticed that Jane did not present additional points on scaling in her presentation, and thus recommended that Jane avoid using \*first' when introducing the topic at the beginning. Adopting ths suggestion, Jane became more attentive to her use of sequence words, and made improvements in the organization of her speeches in the following wees. Meanwhile, the student also commented positively on the note-taking strategy that Jane used to prepare her presentation and mentioned that he would consider using the same method when preparing his presentation. This example indicates that peer fedback is a reciprocal process, whereby through offering feedback, students can also learn valuable skill that are important to achieve their own targets (McCarthy & Dempsey, 2017).

# 4.2.4. Positive reinforcement, motivation and gratitude

In their pr feedback, students also encouraged or motivated their peers to commit to ongoing language practice. The excerpt elow presents Cora's feedback on Jane's presentation on scaling and dental health:

What a wonderful recording Jia! I can't stress this enough but you have such a soothing voice! Its so calming 2 minutes is definitely tooshort) I relly like how you incorporated many questions during your talk to invoke curiosity on the audience end. Also, I notice how there was also hypothetical dialogs that really resognated with what I was thinking when listening to the topic. Overall I really like the pace, structure, and pronunciation. If one thing had tobe improved, perhaps there were one of two short pauses that seemed to be disrupting the flow of the talk, but it was very very minor! Can't wait to hear more of your work next week!"

Jane replied to Cora's feedback as follows:

"Your encouragement gives me motivation. I also notice my pauses. I'll try to improve it. Thank you, Cora!"

As seen in Cora's feedback, apart from suggesting that one or two pauses that may have disrupted the flow of Jane's speech, Cora recognized and pointed out the strengths of Jane's preentation in the areas of language (e.g., pronunciation), content (e.g, topic), and structure (e., speech structure). Furthermore, Cora commented positively on Jane's use of questions, which she found to be effective in maintaining listeners attention. Jane's reaction to ora's comments indicates that pee fedack can motivate students and increase their engagement in their learning (McCarthy & Dempsey, 2017).

# 4.3. Affirming diverse identities

While the main aim of students' action reearch proects was to improve their language proficiency, the CoP model allowed students to take on identities that extended beyond that of a language learner, as demonstrated in Fig. 7 below. $3 7 . 2 \%$ of the data were drawn from discussion threads, $1 9 . 2 \%$ from documents, $1 8 . 4 \%$ from written posts, $1 2 . 2 \%$ from links and other materials, $7 . 3 \%$ from video or audio clips, and $5 . 7 \%$ from images.

# 4.3.1. Integrating multiple identities in their learning and collaboration

When establishing their action research plans, students identified specific goals and language learning needs based on their aca demic, professional and personal identities (e, graduate student, IEL trainer, language teacher, Ytuber, odcaster, parent, etc.) In other words, their learning objectives were driven by the identities they took on. The excerpt below is part of a transcript from

![](img/bb933925fe9ec11a9669b25958c0a5b9b8d1238474ccf0b2e4c46a936e795048.jpg)

Mindy's presentation comparing American and Chinese educational goals.

"Thinking about the three goals, I first think it i a matter of perspective. The sponsors, teachers, students, and parents are obviously thinking differently. As the principals and school administrators, the problems we face are the most complicated and tricky. We have to meet the government's request, at the same time, we must face the ideas of parents and students, and also need to consider the requirements of social employers so we are deeply puzzled by the choice of educational goals. However, as parents, we will gre with the third goal, which means that this goal is the deepest, most fundamental, and has a long history."

When analyzing the educational goals of the Chinese education system, Mindy incorporated her multiple identities developed through previous experience, rather than regarding them as unsuitable or not related to learning (Her, 2005). She explained the complexit of choosing educational goals by drawing on her previous experience s an administrator and principal of a publi school in China. Sheaso demonstrated her identit as a parent (". as parents ..). Mindy's example demonstrates that students do not detach their life histry and lived experiences from their language learning. Theaction reearch model used in ths study empowered students by supporting and encouraging the integration of their past, present and future identities into their language and literacy practices (Her, 2005; Zhang, 2011).

Students also took on multiple identities to support each other during their CoP interactions. For example, as a collaborator and an assesor, oey evaluated Husna's work and wrote detaled comments ased on Husna's rubric (see ig. 8 below). Zoey also took on the role of an editor, who creatively employed a color-coding strategy to provide detailed suggestions on Husna's writing.

Zoey's color-coding feedback helped Husna improve both the content and structure of her writing piece:

Orange color is my corrective feedback, green color is what I think you had done a great job

# Topic: Do you think curfew is necessary for teenagers?

In a recent discussion of cufewwhichis the time that teenagers cant are bannedto go outside without the companion of adults,people show controversial opinions toward the the introduction of the curfew policy,maybe?) policy of curfew.

On the one hand, some argue that teenagers dont need to go out in thenight considering the fact that most crimes take place during midnight. the cnme usually takes placeFrom this perspective, it is not safeif teenagers go outdoors leave homes alone without the accompany of adult by themselves in the evening unsupervised by adults.since For examplethey may not have enough strengths or methods to protect themselves.(Explain further the risk and potential consequence of the behavior,maybe giving a scenario?) On the other hand,however, others argue that it the implementation of curfew will) causes certain (may be change another word instead of certain?) inconvenience ifthere is a curfew policy which starts at 10 pm.For instance in some region there is still sunlight at $1 0 \ : \mathrm { p m }$ Thus, teenagers can go home alone and it is usually safein most cases.

In my view,even though it may cause some inconvenience I still maintain that curfewis necessary for the sake of young generation's secunty.In a gun-free society those who dont own a gun seems in a disadvantaged status compared with those who own a gun.Particularly, teenagers canttake a gun with them legally anywhere When they go out in the night they are facing more dangers than the adult who cantake a gun with them.Of course some may insist that in most counries like Asia there is strictregulation of guns.Thus the curfew policy seems unnessassary at all.Yet I believe it is never too cautious to protect our young generations since we have wimessed many crimes happened on teenagers and leaves broken-hearted parents anywhere.

In condusion I totally agree with the curfew policy and strongly suggest that every nation should establish such policyin order to secure the safety of teenagers as well as our future.

Fig. 8. Zoey's feedack on Husna's writig using a color-coding strategy. For interpretation of th references to color i thi figure leend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)

Thank you so much for al the prompt detailed feedbacks. The words or sentences in orange color really improve the total critical thinking skill in the essay and the green one is exactly what I learned from your recommended book They Say, I Say."

In some cases, students also took on new identities in order to provide more targeted support to their peer. Below is comment by Macy's CoP member on her weekly oral practice. Macy's peer took on the hypothetical identity as an examiner for the IELTS oral test when commenting on Macy's speech by assigning a score based on the IELTS speaking rubric.

"I think your vocabulary is very abundant. It totall fit the IELTs test oral test standard. But I noticed you sometimes have grammar mistakes, like although, however ..If I'm the examiner, I wll give you 8! Good pronunciation by the way!"

As presented in the two examples above, students switched between multiple identities while interacting with their peer (Chang & Sperling, 2014, pp. 31-51; Williamson & Paulsen-Becjac, 2018). They did not mechanically accept the identities ofen imposed on intenational student, such as that of a passive lrner; rather, they were able to critically and flexibly reconstruct new identitie that aligned with the context, and their experience and judgement (Le et al, 2016). Just as Liu (2011) managed to reclaim her identity and grow in confidence when she took up the role of a volunteer teacher, likewise the students in this study demonstrated self-confidence and motivation when they took on identities that gave them autonomy over their learning.

# 4.3.2. Building solidarity through shared identities

Students felt comfortable connecting with their peers on the basis of shared identities based on home country and language (Van Viegen & Zappa-Hollman, 2020). The following is an opening dialogue among students from CoP 5 that took place in person at the beginning of the pandemic. Before starting their speaking practice, the students, who were allfrom China, shared with each other in Mandarin the news they had heard about how coviD-19 was affecting their home country.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Original excerpt</td><td>Translation</td></tr><tr><td>1: F =</td><td>Student 1: It&#x27;s in China, poor thing =</td></tr><tr><td>2: =</td><td>Student 2: =The virus in China.</td></tr><tr><td>+ 3: 1+?+?</td><td>Student 3: What are you talking about?.</td></tr><tr><td>2: , #, 7 =</td><td>Student 2: Virus [on] cruise, and [passengers] can&#x27;t get off, cuz someone on cruise was infected =</td></tr><tr><td>4= </td><td>Student 4: = And there&#x27;s no protection in some rooms, and they were in an enclosed</td></tr><tr><td>1: []* =</td><td>environment.

Their shared identity as Chinese students and their shared concerns about how the virus was spreading in China helped build solidarity among the group members. In addition to building a stronger bond among group members, this small talk also served as a warm-up for their conversation practice and made it easier for members to participate.

# 4.4. Providing a safe and supportive space for academic socialization

The online and hybrid CoPs created and fostered a safe space for academic socialization among students. In this space, students were empowered to acculturate into academic discourses based on their language learning needs. For example, they selected topics (e. g, higher education policies, language asessmet) and gres (eg., analyticl writing, rearch proposal writing) that wre speific to their program of studies. Furthermore, as collaboration is one of the most crucial elements of academic socialization, students aca demic socialization centered around making plans for their group work so that they could collaborate more efectively and efficiently. Fig. 9 below shows the distribution of data. $2 4 . 4 \%$ of the data in the academic socialization category came from written posts, $1 9 . 8 \%$ from discussion threads, $1 9 . 8 \%$ from documents, $1 5 . 0 \%$ from links and other materials, $1 4 . 0 \%$ from video or audio clips, and $7 . 0 \%$ from images.

Fig. 9. Types and percentages of codes in the academic socialization category.

# 4.4.1. Exploring discipline-specific discourse

Previous studies have indicated that language development contributes to more seamles academic socialization as it helps students to engage more actively and confidently in community discourse (Palmer, 2016; Park, 2016). The action research model used in the course allowed students to practise their academic language with their oP members using dicipline-specific topics and materials For example, Jane's program of study and research interests informed her action reearch plan which involved reviewing, synthesizing and presenting research studies on multilingualism. In her presentations, she used discipline-specific terminology (eg, multilingualism, plurilingualism, translanguaging, code switching) to explain various concepts and theories related to multilingualism. While devel. oping academic English proficiency, Jane leant the \*community's language" (Wenger, 1998, p. 164) or the academic discourse used in her field of study, thus preparing her to better socialize into her academic community.

# 4.4.2. Socializing into a new academic and social culture

One of Mindy's action research goals was to understand different education systems, and to introduce and compare them to her peers orall. The hybrid CoP practice helped her to achieve this target by giving her the opportunity to share with the audience her reflections on the Canadian and Chinese education systems. For example, Mindy prepared a presentation entitled My reflections on Chinese education after reading the book Understanding Canadian Schools: An instruction to Educational Administration":

This book is a textbook of educational management and it is very inspiring. The Canadian perspective, the Canadian stance, and the Canadian identity are its most prominent features. This reminds me of the cultural self-confidence that China has recently advocated. Self-confident people are neither conservative, nor the followers of others. Canada's self-confidence in education is commendable. Meanwhile, school change and reform should also have its own self confidence.

China's education has a long history, but it has changed greatly, especiall in the last few decades. In 1952, China had a major school adjustment, mainly learning the Soviet education model, that is, the concept of school service nation building, and the university department was greatly adjusted. For example, Tsinghua University, the top 1 .."

Mindy's peers benefited from listening to her presentations, as they were able to learn more about both Canadian and Chinese educational cultures. There has been advocacy for valuing international students' experiences, reflecting on these experiences in the host communities (Lan, 2018) and encouraging them to integrate these valuable experiences into classoom discourse as a way to contribute to the community as legitimate members (Cho, 2013). As shown in Mindy's example, this study has responded to this advocacy by providing a space for international graduate students to actively contribute their knowledge and lived experiences to their academic community.

Students also had opportunities to learn about a social culturedifferent from their own. Below is an excerpt from one of CoP 5's storytelling practices.

Macy: So I got two cards. The first one is \*time traveler' and the second one is \*'member of the clergy." What's the meaning of "clergy"?

Student 1: Let's ask YouDao [This is an online tool created by a Chinese developer that is similar to Google translate]

Student 2: Clergy

Student 1: #A [this is the Chinese translation of \*member of the clergy" from YouDao] Umm minister $=$

Macy: $=$ Okay so work for the church?

Student 1 & 2: Yes, yes.

Macy: Woo, that's interesting.

As seen in the dialogue above, Macy initially had dificulty understanding the meaning of "clergy." Her peers selected the translation tool that they were most familiar with (YouDao) to translate the word "clergy' into Mandarin. Macy's peer also provided a synonym (\*minister) for the word \*clergy' to help reinforce the group's understanding of the word. Similar to the results of other studies (Cho, 2013; Leki, 2017), per interaction in her academic community helped Macy to advance her vocabulary learning and presented an opportunity for the group to lean about new concepts such as "time raveler and "clergy' that were les familia to them. Thus, this community-based learning model helps students integrate into their local community (Faez & Karas, 2019) by alowing them to explore elements of the new culture they are in, while empowering them to bring thir own cultural and inguistic knowledge into the language learning and socialization process.

# 5. Conclusions & recommendations

In summary, the study demonstrates that participating in online and hybrid CoPs benefited these international graduate students in four main ways. Firstly, students were able to develop academic language competencies in the linguistic and cognitive dimensions.

Secondly, the CoPs allowed students to give and receive constructive and comprehensive feedback focused on language, content organization, their use of asessment tool, and positive reinforcement and motivation. Peer fedback played a crucial role in facil. tating and enabling the linguistic and cognitive developments described in the firs finding of the study. Thirdly, the CoP model affirmed students' diverse identities by encouraging them to take on identities that extended beyond that of an English learner. Students incorporated their various academic, professional and personal identities into their collaborative practices within their CoPs, and created solidarity with each other through their shared linguistic and cultural identities. When collaborating and interacting with their peer, students alo recognized and afirmed their peers' diverse ersonal, academic and professional identite, which helped students acquire "a sense of security" (Her, 2005, p. 132) within their academic communities. Fourthly, the CoPs provided a safe and supportive space for academic socialization, whereby students used the discourses and genres specific to their discipline and learned about new educational and social cultures.

There were everal characteristics of the CoP model in this course that made it partcularlyeffective. irstly, it encouraged learner autonomy and agency among students. Throughout hir action research project, students were encouraged to choose their own goals strategies, resources and assessment, and to decide how they would like to support each other in their CoPs. This developed students confidence in their own ailities, and they were able to recognize and draw on the many anguage skills they alredy posssed, instead of eeing themselves through a deficit perspective (Palmer, 2016). Secondly, the provision of academic language support in this course was multi-tiered; students participated in weekly whole-clas lessons focusing on developing their various academic language and literacies sills, and they then had the opportunity to practise those skils and reinforce their learning with their CoP members throughout the course. The cllborative nature of the CoPs created a living curriculum' (Wenger, 2006), where students' knowledge and expertise were continuously deepened and expanded through their collaboration and peer feedack. Thirdly, the hybrid and online nature of the CoPs provided various advantages, such as the flexibility for students to connect with their peers both synchronously and asynchronously, to meet online with peers who were in diffrent countries, to use online translation tools and multimodal resources o support their learning, and to receive more timely online and divers eedback on their work than the ones they typically receive from their instructors (Spear, 200). Fourthly, the CoP model was linguisticall- and culturall-responsive because students were able to use their home languages when interacting with peers from the same linguistic background, while also learning how to communicate and build relationships with linguistically- and culturally-diverse peers in their graduate community (Faez & Karas, 2019). Fifthly, being enrolled in a graduate degree, students were self-motivated and eager to improve themselves academically. Thus, they were personally motivated to engage more actively in their CoPs.

Although there were numerous benefits of the CoPs in this study, there were also several challenges and limitations to the research. Despite the instructor engaging students in critical discussions during clas around the importance of World Englishes and translanguaging (Garcia & Li Wei, 2014), native speaker and monolingual ideologies were stll evident in the action research goals that a few students et for themselves, and the fedback that students gave their peers (e.g., wanting to sound more like "native speakers" of English). Another limitation pertained to the data that was available for the study. Because data was collected retroactively ater the course ended, we were not able to obtain data from the in-person classes or CoP metings, and thus were not able to establish if there was a relationship between the amount of time students spent in their CoPs and the benefits they accrued from it.

A recommendation arising from this study is that online and hybrid CoPs are an effectie source of academic, language, social, and emotional support for international students in higher education, and should be integrated into existing programs and courses for international students. Instructors can support the succes of CoPs by teaching students how to provide and receive constructive feedback, and equipping students with collaboration and conflic resolution stratgies. Embedding CoPs into an action rearch project can also provide students with the oportunit toaquire the key research literacy skill that are essential for graduate studies, while improving their anguage competencies, becoming familiar with academic discourse and genres, and engaging in critical thinking and discussion with each other. Instructors who work with international graduate students should strive to foster student agency and autonomy by reisting the use of a prescriptive language curculum, but rather, by encouraging students to assess and self-identify areas of their language that they would like to work on and designing the currculum around their needs and goals. The integration of disciplinary content into an academic language course can help students to learn various language skills that are discipline. specific, contextualized, and transferable across their program. Future research on this topic can explore the relative advantages of different online leaning platforms in facilitating CoP interactions and collaborations, and the use of CoPs in other graduat programs of study.
