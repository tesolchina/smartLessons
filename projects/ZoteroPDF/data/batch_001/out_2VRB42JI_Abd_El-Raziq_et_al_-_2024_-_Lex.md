# ABSTRACT

Arabic is characterized by diglossia, which involves the use of two language varieties within a single speech community: Spoken Arabic (SpA) for everyday speech and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for formal speech and reading/ writing. Earlier research suggests that some Arabic-speaking children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might favor MSA over SpA in informal settings, unlike those with Typical Language Development (TLD). Research on typical and atypical lexical abilities within the diglossic context of Arabic is limited. This study investigated the manifestation of diglossia in the lexical skills of Palestinian-Arabic speaking children with and without ASD. A total of 57 Palestinian-Arabic speaking children aged 4-11 were evaluated, comprising three groups: TLD, ASD with language Impairment (LI) $( A S D + L I )$ , and ASD with normal language skills $( A S D + N L )$ ). Two vocabulary tasks were used: comprehension and production of nouns and verbs that manipulated the lexicophonological distance between SpA and MSA. Moreover, a LITMUS-MAIN narrative production task in SpA was administered to all children. The vocabulary comprehension and production tasks were coded for accuracy of response. The production tasks (vocabulary and narrative) were also coded using a special coding rubric according to which all words used were categorized as either SpA or MSA. No differences emerged between the TLD and ASD $+ \mathsf { N L }$ groups in any vocabulary measure, yet lower scores were observed in the $A S D + L 1$ group. In production tasks, all groups utilized SpA more than MSA. Nonetheless, some children with ASD overused MSA lexis. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of lexical skills among children with ASD. The results further underscore the role of diglossia in Arabic in lexical abilities in autism, and thus call for thorough language assessment procedures across different domains.

# 1. Introduction

The acquisition of the lexicon is an essential “building block” of language acquisition. Knowledge of sound patterns and word meaning provides the basis for the child’s understanding of spoken language and their ability to produce intelligible spontaneous speech. Arabic language acquisition takes place within a diglossic context (Ferguson 1959); therefore, children acquiring Arabic need to develop two lexical systems, one in their local dialect, Spoken Arabic (SpA), and one in the language of literacy, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). MSA and SpA lexical items and lexical forms overlap only partly (Saiegh-Haddad & Spolsky 2014), and so some words can be phonologically and/or lexically distant. Nonetheless, the two varieties co-exist and are used simultaneously to fulfil different social functions (e.g., talking to a friend vs. praying). Earlier research suggests that Arabic-speaking children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might opt more than speakers without ASD for MSA structures in contexts where SpA is expected (Kissine et al. 2019). At the same time, children with developmental language disorder $\mathrm { ( D L D ) ^ { \bar { 1 } } } /$ language impairment $( \mathrm { L I } ) ^ { 2 }$ , have been shown to encounter greater difficulties processing MSA words compared to children with typical language development (TLD). For example, children with DLD are challenged in acquiring MSA linguistic structures outside of their SpA vernacular: they experience difficulties with repeating phonological strings that encode MSA phonemes (Saiegh-Haddad & Armon-Lotem in press, Saiegh-Haddad & Ghawi-Dakwar 2017) and they struggle with marking basic MSA inflectional categories (Mahamid & Saiegh-Haddad 2022).

Although there is a growing research interest in the language skills of Arabic-speaking children with and without ASD, across different SpA vernaculars, research in this area remains limited (however, see, Seif Eldin et al. 2008 for a comparison of nine dialects of Arabic; Kissine et al. 2019 for Tunisian-Arabic; and Al-Hasan & Marinis 2021 for Saudi-Arabic) and no study addressed the role of diglossia directly. The current study aimed to address this gap by investigating, for the first time, the role of the diglossic lexico-phonological distance in lexical abilities of Palestinian-Arabic $( \mathrm { P A } ) ^ { 3 }$ speaking children with TLD; as well as in two subgroups of ASD: with LI $( \mathrm { A S D + L I } )$ and with normal structural language skills $( \mathrm { A S D + N L } )$ using structured vocabulary tasks that manipulated lexicalphonological distance. Furthermore, the study examined the spontaneous use of MSA versus SpA in productive vocabulary and narrative production tasks.

In the following subsections, we first review studies on lexical skills in ASD, demonstrating a heterogeneity of lexical abilities among children with ASD. Then, we present a discussion of research testing the impact of diglossia on lexical skills in children with TLD. Next, we focus on lexical skills in Arabic-speaking children with atypical language development (e.g., ASD, DLD). We conclude the introductory subsection with the specific research questions of the current study.

# 1.1. Lexical knowledge in children with ASD

ASD is a complex neurobiological disorder characterized by persistent social communication deficits as well as a restricted, repetitive, stereotyped pattern of interests and behaviors (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth edition (DSM–V); American Psychiatric Association [APA] 2013). Although language is an area of profound difficulty in some individuals with ASD, it is not a core diagnostic criterion (e.g., Schaeffer et al. 2023). Children with ASD show a high heterogeneity of language skills, ranging from minimally verbal to fluent speech. It is estimated that $1 5 - 3 0 \%$ of children with ASD remain nonverbal communicators, while approximately $5 0 \mathrm { - } 7 0 \%$ gain fluent and functional speech (Tager-Flusberg 2016). Even among those who acquire fluent speech, $6 0 - 7 5 \%$ manifest impairments in structural language skills (e.g., phonology, morpho-syntax), independently of diminished nonverbal IQ (Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg 2001, Lindgren et al. 2009, Loucas et al. 2008). Subsequently, current guidelines for ASD diagnoses require this heterogeneity to be addressed by documenting the level of language skills as a severity specifier of the ASD diagnosis (APA 2013). Thus, some children with ASD present intact structural language skills $( \mathrm { A S D + N L } )$ , whereas others display an added structural Language impairment $( \mathrm { A S D + L I } )$ (Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg 2001, Meir & Novogrodsky 2020, Schaeffer et al. 2023). Irrespective of LI status, many children with ASD show difficulties in the domain of pragmatics (for an overview, see, Schaeffer et al. 2023, Schaeffer 2016, Naigles et al. 2017, Sukenik & Tuller 2021). Considering that the two varieties of Arabic (SpA and MSA) fulfil distinct sociolinguistic functions, as an Arabic speaker must constantly differentiate which variety is suitable for a given context, thus, using MSA when SpA is expected can imply pragmatic difficulties.

Earlier studies on the lexical skills of children with ASD have yielded contradictory results. On the one hand, some studies showed that their lexical abilities are intact and are comparable to those of peers with TLD (e.g., Begeer et al. 2013, Bowler et al. 2009, Ellawadi et al. 2017). For instance, Walenski et al. (2008) tested 21 children with and without ASD, aged 8-14, using a vocabulary production task of low-frequency nouns in English and found no differences between the groups. Begeer et al. (2013) used a semantic verbal fluency test with children and adolescents with ASD and TLD, aged 6-23, matched for verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and age, and found no quantitative differences between the groups. On the other hand, others reported severe impairments in the lexical domain for children with ASD (e.g., Arunachalam & Luyster 2016, 2018; Battaglia 2012; Henderson et al. 2011; Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg 2001; Kover et al. 2013). For example, Luyster et al. (2007) used the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Developmental Inventory to assess early lexical development in 93 English-speaking children with ASD, aged 0;8-6;0 years, and showed that word production and comprehension were delayed in children with ASD compared to those of TLD peers. Only a handful of studies focused on the investigation of lexical skills among children with $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ versus $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ (Hani 2015, McGregor et al. 2012). For example, McGregor et al. (2012) reported that children with $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ presented impaired lexical skills, as indicated by lower scores in standardized vocabulary tests, and on two measures of lexical depth (definition and word association tasks), while children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ exhibited intact lexical skills, even though the stimulus words encompassed mentalistic (e.g., believe, consider) and emotion (e.g., love, worship) meanings. Similarly, Hani (2015) showed that lexical skills of 18 school-aged bilingual children with $\mathrm { A S D + L I } ,$ aged 6-10, were lower than those of nonverbal-IQmatched peers with TLD in the vocabulary comprehension task.

To conclude, lexical skills of children with ASD show a high heterogeneity. A recent review of 32 studies revealed that no single factor (e.g., age, task type, nonverbal IQ) could account for the observed variability in this group (Sukenik & Tuller 2021). Thus, an understanding of lexical skills in ASD needs further investigation, and the current study aims to examine lexical skills in Arabic-speaking children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L } ,$ $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ , and TLD in the context of diglossia.

# 1.2. Lexical skills in children with TLD in the context of diglossia

Arabic is a typical case of diglossia, whereby local vernaculars of SpA, referred to collectively as Colloquial Arabic or SpA, exist alongside a rather uniform standardized variety referred to as MSA. SpA vernaculars and MSA are used simultaneously by speakers in different settings (Ferguson 1959), and they fulfill different pragmatic needs and functions (Albirini 2016). Dialects of SpA are generally linguistically related to MSA (Maamouri 1998). Yet, SpA dialects and MSA are also linguistically distant across all language domains: phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon (Saiegh-Haddad & Henkin-Roitfarb 2014, Saiegh-Haddad & Spolsky 2014). This distance between SpA and MSA varies in different vernaculars of SpA and can also vary with the different language domains (Brustad 2000). Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that while MSA is a standardized and codified variety (Holes 1995a), the vernaculars of SpA are primarily regional variants, varying from one country to another and even between different cities, towns, and villages. The significant linguistic differences among the various SpA vernaculars may result in linguistic unintelligibility, as observed between Western (e.g., PA) and Eastern (e.g., Tunisian) dialects of Arabic.

Arabic-speaking children acquire SpA naturally as their mother tongue from exposure to this variety in the home, neighborhood, and daily speech in the community at large. In contrast, exposure to MSA begins primarily (though not exclusively) at school and via literacy instruction in elementary school. Exposure to MSA in preschool varies with the child’s home literacy background and with their family’s socio-economic status (Aram et al. 2013). MSA input comes from informal literacy practices at home, such as story book reading or reading religious texts like the Quran, as well as exposure to media (e.g., cartoons on TV and YouTube). In turn, reduced exposure to MSA implies that unique MSA words, which are not shared across the two varieties, and words that are shared, yet have a different phonological form in MSA will be acquired later and will be harder to process (Saiegh

Haddad 2022, 2023). This assumption especially holds for the lexical skills known to benefit particularly strongly from exposure and input (Akhtar et al. 2001, Hoff 2006; Hoff & Naigles 2002), and it follows from previous findings supporting the role of input (Carroll 2017) and exposure (De Houwer 2018, Tsimpli 2014) in bilingual contexts and in diglossic settings (Grohmann & Kambanaros 2016, Tsiplakou et al. 2022).

The lexical knowledge of children in Arabic diglossia has been shown to be distributed between the two varieties of the language: SpA and MSA. Saiegh-Haddad & Spolsky (2014) measured the scope of the lexical and lexico-phonological distance between SpA and MSA in the composition of the lexicon of 5-year-old speakers of PA in Central Israel by analyzing the language used by children in interactions with peers at the kindergarten center. The analysis of the lexico-phonological distance showed that the spoken lexicon of preschool children consisted of three types of words (1) identical words, which have the same phonological form in SpA and in MSA, for example, /na:m/ ‘sleep’ or /janu:b/ ‘north’; (2) cognate words, which are used in both SpA and MSA varieties, but show partially overlapping lexico-phonological forms (depicting consonant and vowel substitution, deletion, etc.), for example, SpA /kaleb/ vs. MSA /kalb/ ‘dog’; and (3) unique words, which have a unique lexical form in SpA completely different from the parallel word used in MSA, for example, SpA /ʃante:/ vs. MSA /haqˁi:ba/ ‘bag’. The study found that only $2 1 . 2 \%$ of the word types were identical, $4 0 . 6 \%$ were cognate SpA words, and $3 8 . 2 \%$ were unique SpA words. Unique MSA words were not used in peer interactions and Hebrew code-switched words made up $2 \%$ and were not tallied in this analysis. These results demonstrate the formidable oracy-literacy gap in Arabic diglossia: $2 1 \%$ of the words in the preschoolers’ SpA lexicon have an identical form in MSA, while nearly $8 0 \%$ of the total word types have different forms, which could potentially elucidate why preschoolers encounter difficulties in acquiring MSA words.

SpA-MSA lexical distance has consequences for acquisition and lexical knowledge in Arabicspeaking children. For example, Saiegh-Haddad & Haj (2018) tested the lexical-phonological representations of words in PA-speaking children in kindergarten through the 6 grade (kindergarten, first, second, and sixth grade) using a pronunciation accuracy judgment task. Three types of words were compared: identical, cognate, and unique MSA words. Cognate MSA words varied in degree of lexicophonological distance from their form in SpA (1, 2, $^ { 3 + }$ phonological distance parameters). The findings showed that identical words had the highest representational quality, followed by cognates and then by unique MSA words. Moreover, cognate MSA showed differences in representational quality that were compatible with the degree of phonological distance. The results demonstrate an advantage of SpA lexical representations over MSA equivalents, pointing to the challenge that Arabicspeaking children, even those in sixth-grade, encounter in developing accurate phonological representations for MSA words. The authors argue that the phonological distance between the MSA form and its representation in SpA might impede a child’s capacity to accurately encode and retrieve phonological features, even when the word is part of the child’s receptive vocabulary. These findings imply that phonological distance between MSA and SpA affects the phonological encoding and retrieval of MSA lexical items.

Lexical knowledge can be evaluated through narrative production as well, yet few studies investigated narrative abilities in Arabic diglossia addressing lexical usage in SpA and in MSA. Narrative production allows for comparing language skills of bilingual children in their two languages (Gagarina et al. 2012, Pearson 2002). The context of diglossia shares with bilingualism the fact that children grow up with distributed exposure between two varieties of the language and two rather different lexicons. Ravid et al. (2014) tested narrative development using a retelling task of a story heard in MSA among 97 monolingual PA-speaking children across seven age groups (nursery school through adulthood). Interestingly, instead of retelling stories in MSA only, children used both varieties (SpA and MSA). MSA use was more pronounced in older children confirming the link between MSA use and growth in literacy skills. In the same vein, Leikin et al. (2014) examined story retelling abilities among kindergarten PA-speaking children. Children were instructed to retell two stories: one read to them in SpA and another in MSA. The findings showed a significant advantage in retelling when the story was read in SpA than in MSA. Saiegh-Haddad and colleagues developed a novel diglossia-specific scoring rubric to analyze the narrative skills of Arabic-speaking children (Saiegh-Haddad & Spolsky 2014, Asli-Badarneh et al. 2023, Mahamid & Saiegh-Haddad 2022). This rubric included five diglossia-specific word types: (1) identical (e.g., /walad/ ‘boy’); (2) cognate in SpA form (e.g., /malika/ ‘queen’); (3) cognate in MSA form (e.g., /malike/ ‘queen’); (4) unique SpA (e.g., /bise:/ ‘cat’); and (5) unique MSA words (e.g., /qitˤ/‘cat’), Asli-Badarneh et al. (2023) used this rubric to investigate the lexical skills of Arabic-speaking immigrant children (9-12 years) in Canada as reflected in a narrative production task. The study showed that the lexicon of the narratives that school children produced was primarily within their SpA $( 5 9 . 4 6 \% )$ . More specifically, it consisted of identical $( 2 1 . 5 5 \% )$ ), cognate SpA $( 2 5 . 7 3 \% )$ , and unique SpA words $( 1 2 . 1 8 \% )$ . MSA words made up only $3 8 . 5 9 \%$ of the lexicon used in the narratives, consisting of cognate MSA $\left( 1 9 . 9 7 \% \right)$ and unique MSA words $( 1 8 . 6 2 \% )$ . The count of English code-switched words was negligible $( 2 \% )$ . Mahamid & Saiegh-Haddad (2022) used the same rubric to test the lexical skills of PA speaking kindergarten children in Israel and found similar results.

To sum up, the lexico-phonological distance between SpA and MSA has a strong impact on lexical representation and processing in Arabic-speaking children with TLD. Unique MSA words and cognate MSA words are reported to be associated with poorer representations in the lexicon, to be more challenging for retrieval and use in children with TLD than their SpA equivalent forms. These structures are less frequent in the input and are acquired primarily with the onset of MSA exposure through the media and at school. At the same time in children with TLD, with age, differences in linguistic processing in favor of identical linguistic units that are within SpA diminishes and might eventually disappear (Saiegh-Haddad 2022, Saiegh-Haddad et al. 2020, Schiff & Saiegh-Haddad 2018).

# 1.3. Lexical skills in children with atypical language development (DLD and ASD) in the context of Arabic diglossia

Limited research has investigated the role of diglossia in lexical abilities among Arabic-speaking children with atypical language development. Saiegh-Haddad & Ghawi-Dakwar (2017) investigated the role of the lexical and phonological distance between SpA and MSA on phonological representations among PA-speaking children using word and nonword repetition tasks in kindergarten and first grade children with TLD and DLD. The results showed that children with DLD consistently underperformed children with TLD in both kindergarten and first grade on both tasks and regardless of the stimulus type, SpA or MSA. Children with DLD were particularly challenged by repeating nonwords containing MSA phonemes, which are not within their SpA vernacular in both age groups. It should be noted that this effect was observed only in younger children with TLD. With respect to the effect of the lexical form, its effect was similar across the groups, with identical and cognate words being easier to repeat than unique MSA words.

In a series of studies, Saiegh-Haddad & Armon-Lotem (in press) tested linguistic processing in PAspeaking children with DLD compared to their age-matched children with TLD. The authors predicted that linguistic distance would have an impact on language acquisition in all children, with MSA words being more challenging. The results showed that although the impact of linguistic distance was observed in both groups, it was exacerbated in children with DLD and perpetuated over a longer developmental period. This difficulty was attributed to deficits in phonological processing and to lack of exposure to MSA.

Mahamid & Saiegh-Haddad (2022) tested the role of linguistic distance in the morpho-syntactic skills of kindergarten PA speaking children with DLD compared to their peers with TLD as reflected in narrative production in two story modes: story telling in SpA and retelling of a story heard in MSA. The study showed that children with TLD opted more for use of unique MSA lexical and morphosyntactic structures in their narrative production than their DLD peers.

Turning to children with ASD, there is limited research on Arabic. To the best of our knowledge, only one study addressed lexical use of SpA and MSA in Tunisian-Arabic-speaking children with ASD (Kissine et al. 2019). The study documented five cases of children with ASD (aged 5-10 years old) who showed preference for MSA words in their everyday conversations, which does not align with previous studies on children with TLD and DLD showing an advantage for SpA. The authors report that, in total, $3 9 . 6 8 \%$ of the utterances were produced in MSA. For instance, the participants used what we call cognate MSA words (e.g., /layl/ in MSA ‘night’ instead of /li:l/ in SpA) and unique MSA morphosyntactic structures, such as negation using /lam/ ‘did not’. Moreover, they used case markings and inflected verbs following MSA morpho-syntactic rules. These findings imply a greater ease of access to the MSA lexicon for some children with ASD, as well as higher MSA morpho-syntactic skills. At the same time, given that the two varieties of Arabic (SpA and MSA) fulfil distinct socio-linguistic functions (Ferguson 1959, Holes 1995b), this unexpected use of MSA in everyday conversations in Arabic-speaking children with ASD may reflect lack of internalization of the social-pragmatic rules of the language. The authors attributed the unexpected overuse of MSA to a passive exposure to MSA from television. Children with ASD were suggested to rely more on the structural properties of the linguistic input rather than on the communicative function of linguistic interactions. This might explain why children with ASD might benefit more from passive TV exposure compared to their peers with TLD. This explanation aligns with former evidence in favor of video-based learning tools for children with ASD (Charlop-Christy et al. 2000).

A similar intriguing pattern of language choice has been documented among autistic children showing unexpected acquisition of a second language via non-interactive sources. For example, EV, a ten-year-old girl from Bulgaria was reported to have acquired German independently by watching TV shows (Vulchanova et al. 2012). In the same line, Riedel et al. (2020) described the case of an autistic 16-year-old who within three days of Spanish learning was able to understand $9 5 \%$ of the words from newspaper articles and engage in conversations on several day-to-day topics. Most recently, an autistic 11-year-old Russian boy acquired English through passive exposure of watching cartoons in English (Zhukova et al. 2023). It should be kept in mind that nonautistic children seem not to benefit from passive TV exposure (Krcmar et al. 2007, Sachs et al. 1981, Tsao et al. 2004, among many others).

Turning back to Arabic, it is worth noting that a considerable amount of exposure to MSA comes from cartoon TV programs and dubbed series which children are frequently exposed to from early ages (Alshamrani 2012). At the same time, TV time was shown to be greater in children and adolescents with ASD as compared to their TLD peers or other clinical groups, and TV exposure starts at a younger age in autistic children (Slobodin et al. 2019). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that the reported preference for MSA in children with ASD might be attributed to their higher TV time exposure to MSA via TV (Slobodin et al. 2019), and their advantage in acquiring language through non-interactive sources (Vulchanova et al. 2012, Zhukova et al. 2023).

# 1.4. Current study

The current study was devised to investigate lexical skills in three groups of PA-speaking children: $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ , $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ , and their TLD peers. For this purpose, vocabulary tasks (targeting comprehension and production of nouns and verbs) manipulating lexical-phonological distance between SpA and MSA and a narrative production task in SpA were administered to all children. Three research questions were addressed as follows.

Research Question 1 (RQ1): Are there differences between PA-speaking children with $A S D + N L$ and $A S D + L I$ compared to their TLD peers in noun and verb comprehension and production abilities?

We hypothesized that children with $_ { \mathrm { A S D + L I } }$ would underperform their peers with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and TLD on all tasks (aligning with previous research on children with LI (e.g., Arunachalam & Luyster 2016, 2018; Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg 2001). No differences between $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and TLD were expected in the comprehension and production of nouns and verbs (e.g., McGregor et al. 2012). More specifically, we aimed to investigate the impact of lexical-phonological distance on accuracy scores within the context of diglossia. We hypothesized that PA-speaking children with ASD might pattern differently compared to their peers with TLD in comprehending and producing cognate and unique lexical items, particularly those with greater lexical-phonological distance between SpA and MSA.

Research Question 2 (RQ2): Are there differences in the manifestation of diglossia in the composition of the lexicon of PA-speaking children across the three groups (TLD vs. $A S D + N L$ vs. $A S D + L I )$ as reflected in their use of SpA and MSA lexical items in vocabulary and in narrative production tasks implemented in SpA?

Since there is no previous research on lexical abilities in PA-speaking children with ASD, we held two competing hypotheses. On the one hand, we hypothesized that PA-speaking children with ASD might resort to MSA in line with the findings by Kissine et al. (2019) for Tunisian-Arabic speaking children with ASD. On the other hand, we expected children with ASD to pair up with their peers with TLD and DLD (Asli-Badarneh et al. 2023) and DLD (Mahamid & Saiegh-Haddad 2022, Saiegh-Haddad & Armon-Lotem in press, Saiegh-Haddad & Ghawi-Dakwar 2017) showing a preference for SpA over MSA.

Research Question 3 (RQ3): How prevalent is the preference for MSA over SpA in children with $A S D + N L$ and ASD $+ L I$ compared to children with TLD?

We hypothesized that differences might emerge, with some children with ASD showing this preference for the variety not used in everyday conversations (e.g., Kissine et al. 2019) and perhaps more in children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ than in ASD $^ +$ LI. No such preference was expected to emerge in children with TLD.

# 2. Methods

# 2.1. Participants

A total of 57 children4 with and without ASD, aged 4-11 years, took part in three groups in the current study: children with TLD ${ \mathrm { ( n = 1 9 } }$ ), children with ASD with intact structural language skills $( \mathrm { A S D + N L }$ : $\mathbf { n } = 1 9$ ) and with impaired structural language $\mathrm { \Delta A S D + L I }$ : $\mathbf { n } = 1 9$ ). All children were speakers of a local dialect of PA spoken in the Muθallaθ “Triangle” area in Central Israel. They resided in six cities from the same area and were raised in monolingual PA-speaking families in Israel. They all attended PA-speaking kindergartens and schools in which the language of instruction was Arabic. No children came from mixed towns where both Hebrew and Arabic are spoken, and therefore children were not exposed to Hebrew in the immediate environment. As Hebrew is taught to Arabic speakers as an additional language in the second grade, no child had formal early exposure to Hebrew5 before age 6.

Demographic information was obtained through a parental questionnaire. For children with TLD, the questionnaire included information on age, the number of siblings in the family, birth order, socioeconomic status determined by the mother’s level of education, and any history of diagnosed developmental disorders (e.g., LI, ASD, hearing loss, and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) or previous speech-language therapy. For children with ASD, the parental questionnaire delved further into medical information, including the age of diagnosis, details about the evaluations conducted, ongoing treatments, and the type of educational placement (special education or mainstream). Additionally, the questionnaire inquired about parents’ intervention plans, such as behavioral plans and parental guidance.

Two additional background measures were used to match the groups. The Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (Raven 1998) to assess nonverbal IQ and give a better indication of cognitive abilities for children with and without ASD. Moreover, structural language skills were assessed using two repetition tasks: sentence and non-word repetition tasks. The PALITMUS Sentence Repetition (SRep) task (Saiegh-Haddad et al. 2019) that was developed following the conventions of the LITMUS SRep task (Marinis & Armon-Lotem, 2015). The task included 36 sentences in PA of different morpho-syntactic structures varying in length (3-7 words) and complexity; including simple and complex syntactic structures known to be challenging for children with LI. One point was awarded for correct repetition of the target syntactic structure, resulting in total raw scores ranging from 0 to 36. The PA Non-Word Repetition (NWR) task (Saiegh-Haddad & Ghawi-Dakwar 2017) included 18 items of varying syllabic lengths (1-4 syllables), syllabic structure, and phonological complexity (i.e., the presence of the consonant cluster). One point was assigned for accurate performance, leading to a total raw score ranging from 0 to 18. Raw score for SRep and NWR tasks were converted to ratios. Table 1 presents the demographic data for participants per group. Next, we describe the groups.

# 2.1.1. Children with TLD

Nineteen children with TLD (3 females and 16 males) aged 4-11 years $\mathrm { { ' M _ { a g e } } } = 9 1 . 6 3$ months, $\mathrm { S D = }$ 24.98 months) participated. Children with TLD were recruited through kindergartens, schools, and social networks. They had no diagnosed developmental disorders (e.g., LI, ASD, hearing loss, and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and no history of speech-language therapy or other parental concerns, as determined by parental questionnaires. All children with TLD were attending Arab mainstream kindergartens and schools in Israel.

# 2.1.2. Children with ASD

Thirty-eight children were diagnosed with ASD prior to the study by a multidisciplinary team. They attended ASD classes within mainstream schools, and/or special education kindergartens in the special education system. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2, Lord et al. 2012) was administered by the first author, who is a Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) certified to conduct ADOS assessment for research purposes, to re-confirm the diagnosis, and to obtain a measure of ASD severity as part of the study\`s battery. Comparison scores (i.e., calibrated severity scores) ranging on a 10-point rating scale were computed, with higher scores indicating higher symptom levels. The computed severity score varied between 1-8 $\mathbf { M } = 3$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 3 .$ ) in the $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ group indicating mild symptoms and between 3-10 $\mathbf { M } =$ 7, $\mathrm { S D } = 2 $ ) in the $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ group which indicates moderate symptoms of ASD. Based on the tentative standards of the TLD group performance, we detected 19 participants with intact morpho-syntactic skills $\mathrm { ( A S D + N L ) }$ : 3 females and 16 males, $\mathbf { M } _ { \mathrm { a g e } } = 9 1$ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 2 4$ months; and 19 participants with morpho-syntactic skills at risk for LI $\mathrm { ( A S D + L I ) }$ : 3 females and 16 males, $\mathbf { M } _ { \mathrm { a g e } } = 9 1$ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 2 5$ months. All children (TLD and ASD) scored within the normal range on nonverbal IQ as measured by Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (Raven 1998).

One-way ANOVA analyses and chi-squared tests were applied to compare the three groups $\mathrm { ( A S D + N L }$ vs. $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ vs. TLD) on background factors. The three groups did not differ in age, nonverbal IQ, socioeconomic status (SES) as measured by the mother’s years of education, testing-mode, or gender (see Table 1). However, significant differences emerged for ASD severity scores between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ , as measured by the calibrated severity ADOS scores. By definition, there were significant differences on the SRep and NWR task between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and TLD. Significant group differences were detected between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + }$ NL on SRep, yet no significant differences were observed between the two ASD groups for NWR.

# 2.2. Experimental Tasks

# 2.2.1. Arabic diglossic noun and verb comprehension and production tasks

The Arabic diglossic lexical tasks were adapted from LITMUS-CLT (Language Impairment Testing in Multilingual Settings – Cross-linguistic Lexical Tasks). They were developed as part of a larger project aiming at assessing language skills in PA-speaking children in the context of diglossia (Saiegh-Haddad & Armon-Lotem 2020). These tasks were designed to be administered in both varieties, SpA and MSA. In this study, we administered the tasks in SpA, here PA. The tasks manipulate grammatical class (verbs and nouns), modality (comprehension and production), and lexico-phonological distance between SpA and MSA within the context of diglossia (identical, cognates, and unique words). For example, target words were of three types: identical /ba:b/ ‘door’, cognate /kaleb/ ‘dog’, and unique SpA /suħwe:le:/ ‘slide’ (see Table 2 for more examples). The same categories of lexical item targets were used for testing comprehension and production skills. Thirty noun-images and thirty verb-images representing the three lexico-phonological SpA-MSA distance words were used. All pictures were taken from the CLT pool of colored images (Haman et al. 2015) and the ClipArt website. For the entire list of items, see Online Supplemental Appendix S1. Distractors in the comprehension tasks were of three types: semantic, visual, phonological. For instance, consider the target unique SpA/MSA noun /qˤetˤtˤa; bisse/ ‘cat’, this target word had three distractors: /ðanabe/ ‘tail’ (visual: part of a whole), /qˤisˤsˤa/ ‘book story’ (phonological: overlapping with the unique phonological structure of the MSA target in first consonantal phoneme and vocalic pattern), and /fa:r/ ‘mouse’ (semantic: animal category). Images were displayed using a PowerPoint presentation for the comprehension task in which the child was required to select a picture out of four options that depicted the object/action presented orally to them in PA. As for the production tasks, children were instructed to name the object/action in the picture, yet no specific instructions were provided regarding the language to be used in the production, namely whether to name the object/action in the picture in PA or in MSA. One point was awarded for each correctly comprehended/ produced word. We didn’t penalize children for using MSA instead of SpA. Raw scores for accuracy ranged from 0 to 30 in each vocabulary task, corresponding to the total number of items. These raw scores were converted to ratios. Additionally, responses in the vocabulary production tasks were categorized as SpA or MSA using a special coding rubric (see Table 2).

Table 2. Examples of the coding rubric of the production data from the productive vocabulary and the narrative production task.

Note 1. Abbreviations: $\mathsf { S p A } = \mathsf { 1 }$ Spoken Arabic; ${ \mathsf { M S A } } =$ Modern Standard Arabic. Note 2. Others: Words in this category differ from their base form in word type and/or grammatical category, and they can be considered as neologisms.

As part of the task design, we conducted noun/verb frequency and age of acquisition (AoA) ratings with 15 adults (14 female and 1 male) working with children in early development, including speech and language pathologists, preschool teachers, and Arabic language teachers. These adults completed a questionnaire and rated the lexical items. The subjective frequency/ AoA ratings used a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicated infrequent /early AoA and 5 denoted high frequency /later AoA. The mean frequency ratings were $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 4 . 1$ ; Range: 2.36-4.86) for nouns and $\mathbf { M } = 3 . 9 3$ ; Range: 2.57-4.79) for verbs. The mean AoA rating were $( \mathrm { M } = 2 . 5 6$ ; Range: 1.9- 4.34) for nouns and ( $\mathbf { M } = 3 . 0 5$ ; Range: 1.89-4.44) for verbs. These ratings collectively indicate that both nouns and verbs included in the tasks are frequently used and are acquired at an early age.

# 2.2.2. Narrative production task

“The $\mathrm { D o g } ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ stimuli from the LITMUS-MAIN narrative assessment battery (Gagarina, et al. 2012) were used to obtain narrative production in SpA via a telling mode. The narrative task consists of 6 pictures which represent three episodes (two pictures for each episode) arranged in a sequence using PowerPoint. First, children were presented with the entire set of 6 pictures to understand the plot of the story. When the child was ready to tell the story, pictures were presented in pairs. Instructions were given in SpA: “First, look carefully at all the pictures, this is the first picture, and this is the last one. These pictures represent a story. Now I want you to tell the story based on the pictures. Let me know when you are ready to tell the best story you can”. No specific instructions were given with respect to the language variety to be used in the story production. Narratives were transcribed and analyzed using the CLAN software (MacWhinney & Snow 1990).

In all production tasks (both narrative and vocabulary), lexical items were coded for SpA/MSA usage, applying a special coding rubric, which included the word type (identical, cognate, unique SpA, and unique MSA) and their morpho-phonological realization (SpA or MSA), resulting in 11 diglossic lexical categories (see Table 2). Within our coding rubric, we also considered the use of inflections. In the verb and narrative production tasks, children inflected the target words. Therefore, we distinguished between identical words in SpA and MSA, using the morpho-phonological realization in each variety. The category distribution was calculated out of the total number of tokens in each production task.

# 3. Procedure and data analysis

# 3.1. Procedure

Written/electronic parental consent was obtained for all children, and each parent/caregiver completed a short background questionnaire prior to his/her child participating in the study. For children with ASD, questionnaires also included medical diagnosis and educational information. Children’s oral assent was secured before each testing session. Testing was performed by the first author, who is a qualified SLP and a native speaker of the PA vernacular spoken by the children in the current study. Instructions and test administration were conducted in PA. First, the noun-verb production tasks were administered, followed by the noun-verb comprehension and then the narrative production task. The order of the tasks was kept constant across all participants. Each participant was tested individually, in a quiet room in the preschool/school/language therapy clinic, or at their home.

The current study is part of a larger project aiming to document the linguistic and cognitive abilities of PA-speaking children with ASD. Children participated in 1-4 sessions of 20-80 minutes depending on their level of cooperation. The data were collected under COVID-19 restrictions during 2020-2021. Therefore, some children were tested using traditional face-toface assessment, while some children were tested via Zoom (see Table 1). Children’s responses were audio-recorded for later off-line transcription and coding. The study was approved by Bar-Ilan University and the Chief Scientist of the Israel Ministry of Education. Raw data and materials for this study can be retrieved from https://osf.io/v48r5/?view_only $=$ 1e6d96a571084b42b5da8c99fa44990d.

# 3.2. Data analysis

For comprehension and production data, the Arabic diglossic lexical tasks were coded using binary scoring ( $1 =$ Correct, $0 =$ Incorrect). Data analysis reported below was carried out using R software (Version 4.0.3; R Core Team 2020).

To address the first research question, which assessed differences in the accuracy scores among PA-speaking children across TLD, $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ groups, we analyzed the results using mixed-effects logistic regression models, given the binary nature of the comprehension and production data. We implemented a stepwise-step-up procedure to build the mixed-effects models. The random effects were determined initially. First, we generated a baseline model, and then we fitted a baseline mixed-effect model, that is, a “null model” with crossed random intercept for participantcode only. Next, we compared the models, if the latter model had a significantly better fit to the data, the inclusion of random effects structures was warranted. And then, we loaded item-number, and testing-mode (face-to-face vs. teleassessment). The final model included random effects if only they improved the models’ fit. Next, we entered the fixed predictors which included: a) Item characteristics: Frequency, age of acquisition (AoA) and word type (identical, cognate, unique); b) child\`s background variables (age, nonverbal IQ, SES) and group (3 levels: TLD vs. $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ vs. $\mathrm { A S D + L I } )$ . Next, we added three two-way interactions between group\*AoA, group\*frequency and group\*word type. Fitted models were compared in terms of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), with reduced AIC and BIC values indicating a better model fit. This was supplemented by Likelihood ratio tests conducted to determine whether the inclusion of a predictor significantly improved the fit of the model. The significance level of the main fixed effects was obtained using the ANOVA function. We report results from the highest-level model that converged (Barr et al. 2013). Significant interactions were followed, with pairwise post-hoc comparisons with Tukey-adjusted significance levels. These were obtained by the emmeans package (Lenth et al. 2020).

To address the second research question of the study regarding the manifestation of diglossic lexical categories in the lexicon deployed by children in the vocabulary production and narrative tasks, nounverb vocabulary production tasks (correct/incorrect responses) and narrative data were coded for diglossia-specific lexico-phonological distance features (Asli-Badarneh et al. 2022, Saiegh-Haddad & Spolsky 2014), following the coding rubric, presented in Table 2. We fitted lmer models using the lme4 package (Version 1.1–25; Bates et al. 2015), $\boldsymbol { p }$ -values were calculated using the lmerTest package (Version 3.1–3; Kuznetsova et al. 2017). We implemented a stepwise-step-up procedure for building the linear mixed-effects model. We started by fitting a model with no predictors, followed by a ‘null model’ with crossed random intercept for participant-code only, then we loaded fixed variables (independent variables) which included diglossic lexical categories (11 levels: identical, identical SpA, identical MSA, cognate SpA, cognate MSA, unique SpA-SpA, unique SpA-MSA, unique MSAMSA, unique MSA-SpA, Hebrew-SpA, others), age, and group (3 levels: TLD vs. $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ vs. $\mathrm { A S D + }$

LI). Next, we added two two-way interactions between group\*age, and group\*diglossic lexical categories interactions.

To address the third question, which focuses on the preference for MSA over SpA across the groups, a qualitative analysis was conducted to depict the distribution of the diglossic lexical categories at the group level.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Comprehension and production of nouns and verbs

As mentioned earlier, we fitted a mixed-effects logistic regression model to account for group differences in the vocabulary tasks. The observed performance for the three groups for noun and verb comprehension and production tasks is presented in Figure 1. The final models are presented in Table 3.

# 4.1.1. Noun and verb comprehension

Starting with the comprehension data, the effect of word type (identical, cognate, unique) was found only in noun comprehension, with cognate $\left( \boldsymbol { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ and unique $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 4 \right)$ being significantly different from identical words. The follow-up post-hoc comparisons for word type, revealed that, across the groups, children were more accurate in cognate SpA as compared to identical words $\mathrm { \bf { E M M } } = - 1 . 9 0$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 5 6 $ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ . The item frequency and AoA were also significant, yet only in noun comprehension, with children being more accurate in items with higher frequency and earlier AoA $\left( \boldsymbol { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ .

Turning to the child’s background factors, the effect of SES was observed exclusively in noun comprehension, with higher SES levels correlated with better scores. Additionally, the effect of age and group were significant for nouns and verbs. The effect of age showed that older children were more likely to comprehend nouns and verbs accurately as compared to younger children $\left( \boldsymbol { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ . As for the effect of group, it was significant for both noun and verb comprehension, showing that children with TLD scored higher than $\mathrm { A S D } + \mathrm { L I } ~ ( p = . 0 1 ; ~ p < . 0 0 1$ , respectively). The follow-up post-hoc comparisons on the group effect showed significant differences between TLD and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ for noun $( \mathrm { E M M } = 1 . 1 4 $ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 4 3$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = . 0 2 , } \end{array}$ ) and verb $\mathrm { \Phi } ^ { \mathrm { \tiny { E M M = 1 . 3 6 } } }$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 4 4$ , $p = . 0 1 \AA .$ ) comprehension. Differences neither between TLD and $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ nor between $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ were significant in both tasks.

# 4.1.2. Noun and verb production

As for vocabulary production, in neither task was the effect of word type (identical, cognate, unique) significant. On noun and verb production, the effect of item frequency was observed, with more frequent nouns and verbs being more likely to be named accurately. However, the effect of item AoA was not significant in both tasks. Turning to the child’s background factors, the effect of age was observed for nouns and verbs $( p = . 0 1 , \ p < . 0 0 1$ , respectively), showing that older children were more likely to produce nouns and verbs accurately as compared to younger children. Moreover, there was a significant effect of nonverbal IQ for nouns and verbs $( p = . 0 4 , p < . 0 0 1$ , respectively), showing that the higher the nonverbal IQ, the better the performance. On noun and verb production, the effect of group was significant, indicating that the TLD group outperformed the $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ group $\left( \boldsymbol { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ . The follow-up post-hoc comparisons on the group effect for noun production confirmed significant differences between TLD and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ $\mathrm { ' E M M } = 0 . 9 5$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 2 9$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ , and between $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ $\mathrm { \Delta E M M } = 0 . 7 9$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 2 7 $ , $p = . 0 1 \mathrm { \cdot }$ ). As for verb production, the follow-up post-hoc comparisons showed significant differences between TLD and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ $( \mathrm { E M M } = 1 . 9 9 $ , $\mathrm { S E = }$ 0.28, $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ , and between $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ $\mathrm { \mathrm { E M M } } = 1 . 3 0$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 2 6 $ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ . Children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ performed on par with TLD on noun $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = . 8 4 \right)$ and verb $( p = . 0 5 1 )$ production, however, the difference for verb production accuracy was marginal.

# 4.2. SpA versus MSA use in the production tasks: Noun-verb production and narrative production

We analyzed the distributions of diglossic lexical in the vocabulary production and narrative tasks.   
Data are presented in Figure 2. The final models are shown in Table 4.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of diglossic lexical categories across the groups in the noun and verb vocabulary tasks, and in narrative production. For more information on means and SDs per diglossic lexical category per group in each task, see S3 in the Online Supplementary material. Overall, all groups favored the SpA word form over the MSA form. Starting with the vocabulary production tasks, the results for noun and verb production indicated a significant effect of the diglossic lexical category. Neither the effect of group nor the group\*diglossic lexical category interaction turned out to be significant. The follow-up post-hoc analysis on the effect of diglossic lexical category showed that the identical word category was the most prevalent for nouns $\mathrm { \Delta E M M } = 0 . 3 1$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 0 1 $ ) and the identical SpA category for verbs (EMM $= 0 . 3 0$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 0 1 $ ).

Turning to the narrative task, the final model included the diglossic lexical category and diglossic lexical category\*group as predictors. Group differences were observed in the use of unique SpA-SpA $\mathrm { ( T L D > A S D + N L }$ , $\mathrm { E M M } = 0 . 1$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 0 3$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ and cognate MSA $\mathrm { \Delta T L D < }$ $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ , $\mathrm { E M M } = - \ 0 . 0 7 $ , $\mathrm { S E } = 0 . 0 3$ , $ { p } = . 0 4 )$ ). It should be noted that cognate SpA words were the most frequently used across the groups in the narrative production.

To summarize, there were significant differences between the TLD and the $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ groups in the use of unique SpA-SpA and cognate MSA words, yet no differences emerged between the TLD and the $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ groups. Moreover, no group differences were observed between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ . Although SpA words were more prevalent across all the groups in both tasks, in general, the use of

MSA words were pronounced to a greater extent in the vocabulary production tasks than in the narrative production task (see S3 in the Online Supplementary materials for the distribution across groups and tasks).

# 4.3. Individual differences in the SpA-MSA distribution patterns across the groups

In addressing our third research question pertinent to individual differences in the distribution of diglossic lexical categories, we plotted the data per participant across the three groups in the vocabulary and narrative tasks. Across all groups and tasks, most children resorted to SpA words more often compared to MSA equivalents. However, surprisingly few children used MSA words more extensively: TLD (1 out of 19), $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ (4 out of 19), $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ (1 out of 19) (see Figure 3, darker colors represent MSA usage). Detailed data on the vocabulary production tasks can be found in S5 of the Online Supplementary materials. In what follows, we provide qualitative examples aimed at illustrating the particularities of MSA use in the narrative production. Note that we focus on the narrative data, as it encompasses spontaneous utterances rather than just single words.

In the narrative production, a subset of children opted for MSA variety. With respect to lexical choice, they used cognate MSA and unique MSA-MSA lexical items, encompassing nouns, verbs, temporal expression, particles and negation markers instead of their SpA equivalents. When considering the syntactic and morpho-syntactic aspects, these children produced cognate and identical words following MSA morpho-syntactic and morpho-phonological conventions. The following Example produced by a child with $\mathrm { A S D + N L } ,$ presents the use of unique MSA-MSA particles, such as /Ɂan/ ‘to’ to introduce a verb clause and /laqˁad/ ‘have already’ to describe that the action has already been done. Furthermore, the child used a temporal expression /ʕindama:/ ‘when’ which is a unique

MSA word (its SpA equivalent is /lamma:/). As for verbs, the child used a cognate MSA verb /laħeqa/ ‘chased’ instead of /liħik/ and /jaqˁi:m/ ‘take out’ which represents a mixed SpA-MSA form, i.e., a unique SpA verb is inflected following MSA morphology. This example demonstrates the use of VSO word-order (i.e., the unmarked word order in MSA), the use of verbs inflected for gender using a masculine prefix such as ‘ja’ (e.g., /juħawel/ ‘he tries’), and the use of the case markings (e.g., /laħeqa/ ‘he chased’), which are all not part of the PA spoken vernacular.

It is noteworthy that this example, among others, reflects greater mastery of MSA. Yet, this trend of MSA preference over SpA was observed in only a small number of children across all three groups. This implies that the tendency to rely on MSA might be a general trait, not related to clinical group affiliation, even though the results seem to point that it was the most prevalent in children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ .

# 5. Discussion

The present study investigated lexical skills of PA-speaking children in three groups (TLD vs. $\mathrm { A S D + }$ NL vs. $\mathrm { A S D + L I } )$ . First, it examined group differences in the accuracy of noun and verb comprehension and production. Second, it investigated the lexical manifestation of diglossia in the composition of the lexicon across the three groups, specifically the relative use of SpA versus MSA lexical forms in the vocabulary (nouns and verbs) and narrative production tasks. Third, it scrutinized the individual data to address potential variability in the use of SpA versus MSA in the context of Arabic diglossia among children with and without ASD.

# 5.1. Quantitative group differences in the comprehension and production of nouns and verbs: TLD, $A S D + N L$ and $A S D + L I$

The first research question of the study addressed quantitative differences in the comprehension and production of nouns and verbs as an index of their lexical skills. The results showed that children with $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ underperformed both the $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and the TLD groups in verb and noun comprehension and production replicating earlier findings (e.g., Arunachalam & Luyster 2016, 2018; McGregor et al. 2012; Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg 2001). The performance of the $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ group was indistinguishable from the TLD group in the production and comprehension of nouns and verbs. It is noteworthy that the tasks were administered in SpA, and they included early acquired nouns and verbs. The tasks did not target abstract words, such as social-emotional terms, metaphors, or mental states, which are known to constitute an area of difficulty for most children with ASD, including children with intact structural language skills (Hobson & Lee 1989, Schaeffer et al. 2023). These results extend previously documented findings for morpho-syntactic skills to the lexical domain, showing that children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ perform on a par with their TLD peers whereas children with $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ show reduced lexical abilities. Differences between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ in the lexical domain have been previously reported for English (e.g., McGregor et al. 2012). These findings emphasize that although language is not a core deficit in ASD according to DSM-V (APA 2013), children with ASD show variability across different language domains.

Given the diglossic nature of Arabic, the current study addressed the influence of the lexicalphonological distance between SpA and MSA on the lexical skills of children by manipulating lexicalphonological distance and targeting identical, cognate and unique words. We tested the effect of lexical distance on the comprehension of words and by analyzing performance in productive vocabulary and narrative production tasks according to the same diglossia-specific rubric of word type. Given earlier reports of overuse of MSA words among children with ASD (Kissine et al. 2019), it was predicted that this group of children might pattern differently from children with TLD in comprehension and production of cognate and unique MSA words. Our results showed no differences between children with ASD and peers with TLD on any of the lexical categories targeted including cognate, and unique MSA words. These results suggest that PA-speaking children with ASD do not show any difference from peers with TLD in familiarity with SpA words across distant categories and in access to parallel MSA forms of words.

# 5.2. Lexical manifestation of diglossia across the three groups: TLD, ASD+NL and ASD+LI

The second question of the study delved into the manifestation of diglossia in the composition of the lexicon of PA-speaking children with and without ASD as reflected in the production tasks. Following a previous study by Kissine et al. (2019) which reported five cases of children with ASD who overused MSA in an informal social context, we analyzed the lexical basis of the vocabulary and narrative production tasks to test this argument more systematically and in a larger sample. At the group level, the findings did not support the claim regarding the overuse of MSA words in children with ASD. All groups (TLD, $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ , and $\mathrm { A S D + L I } )$ opted more for SpA words over MSA: Identical and identical SpA words were the most frequently used in the noun and verb production tasks, and cognate SpA words were used the most in the narrative production task. At the same time, some group differences emerged in the distribution of the diglossic lexical categories especially in the narrative production task with children with $_ { \mathrm { A S D + N L } }$ producing fewer unique SpA words and more cognate MSA words compared to children with TLD. The use of fewer unique SpA words suggests that children with ASD $+ \mathrm { N L }$ have opted for the equivalent unique MSA words more frequently than children with TLD.

Moreover, there were no differences in the distribution of lexical categories between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and TLD, nor between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ , implying that children with $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ make use of the same categories as their TLD peers. However, they showed a slightly higher production of MSA words despite their structural language deficit and lower scores on the vocabulary tasks in general. These findings support earlier evidence indicating a greater reliance on SpA than MSA words in narrative production (e.g., Asli-Badarneh et al. 2023, Ravid et al. 2014). Yet, children in the $_ \mathrm { A S D + N L }$ group showed an increased use of MSA words and fewer unique SpA words than the other groups aligning with Kissine et al. (2019). These findings are interesting, considering that cognate MSA words and unique MSA words have SpA corresponding forms, which are more familiar and accessible to children due to their higher frequency in their language input. The increased use of these MSA words in some children with $_ \mathrm { A S D + N L }$ suggests they may possess a larger MSA vocabulary and a more robust MSA lexical- phonological representations, making them more readily available to children. That said, considering that the instructions were given in SpA, the excessive use of MSA among these children raises questions about their pragmatic skills, that is, language use in context, and might reflect challenges in understanding the social-pragmatic aspects of the Arabic language and the different use of each variety (Ferguson 1959).

The overall heavier reliance on SpA words in production tasks in all three groups was expected, since SpA is the variety that all Arabic speakers use in everyday speech in their immediate environment and acquire naturally as their mother tongue. Opting to SpA can be accounted by the relative ease of access to the lexicon of SpA (Henkin 1998, Nevat et al. 2014), especially due to more accurate phonological representations of SpA words (Saiegh-Haddad & Haj 2018).

# 5.3. Individual differences in lexical skills in children with and without ASD

The study’s third question addressed individual differences in the extent of the SpA versus MSA preference in children with ASD and TLD. Based on the findings by Kissine et al. (2019), the composition of the lexicon was predicted to consist of MSA lexical words more than SpA words at least in some children with ASD. Our prediction was confirmed. However, not only in children with ASD. An overreliance on MSA words, such as identical MSA, cognate MSA, and unique MSA words, was observed in one child with TLD $5 \%$ of the TLD group), four children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ ( $4 4 \%$ of the $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ group), and one child with $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ ( $5 \%$ of the $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ group). These findings highlight individual differences in the lexical skills among children with ASD and TLD and they also show that the phenomenon of overuse of MSA might be more prevalent among children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ . Children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ used MSA words to a greater extent, and this might reflect a richer MSA vocabulary lexicon and a greater mastery of morpho-syntactic structures, as evidenced in the use of MSA function words, case inflections, MSA verbal inflections carrying aspect, as well the VSO word order. These findings from PA-speaking children are in line with reports from five Tunisian-Arabic-speaking children with ASD of the same age (Kissine et al. 2019). This increased MSA use in children with ASD might be accounted for by the fact that autistic individuals can acquire languages solely through non-interactive TV exposure (see Vulchanova et al. 2012, Zhoukova et al. 2023). Although we did not collect information about the amount of TV exposure in the children participating in the current study, there is evidence that TV time was shown to start at a younger age and to be greater in children and adolescents with ASD compared to their TLD peers or other clinical groups (Slobodin et al. 2019). Therefore, following previously documented cases, we can also suggest that children with ASD in the current sample might have had considerable TV exposure, which led to the increased knowledge and use of MSA words. At the same time, the findings for autistic children contrast with the evidence for toddlers with TLD, who acquire most words through live interaction rather than via TV exposure (Krcmar et al. 2007). Furthermore, for children with TLD, no links are found between children’s mastery of MSA and the extent of exposure to TV and books (Khamis-Dakwar et al. 2012, Leikin et al. 2014), suggesting that children with TLD acquire MSA through active language acquisition processes.

# 5.4. Limitations and future research

Although the data collected and analyzed in this study provide novel insights into the variation of lexical skills among PA-speaking children with and without ASD, the study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, it would have been beneficial to include more background information on the extent of exposure to MSA through screen time (e.g., TV, computers, tablets) and literacy practices. This additional data could have helped unravel the reasons behind the higher MSA lexical skills observed in some children with ASD. Second, the study lacks measures of reliability for the experimental tasks (e.g., test-retest) and does not report inter-rater reliability, these indices are necessary to utilize the experimental tasks for clinical assessment. Third, there is an on-going discussion regarding potential distinction of input-intake in children with and without ASD (e.g., Arunachalam & Luyster 2016, 2018; Naigles 2013; Tenenbaum et al. 2017). However, our study’s design did not include direct measures of in-the-moment learning, limiting its ability to address these specific questions. Last, for the findings of this study to be applicable to a broader population, a larger sample size is required to generalize and validate our findings effectively.

Furthermore, future research should aim to expand research on lexical abilities of children with ASD. First, data from speakers of other SpA dialects living in other regions is necessary to confirm the external validity of the findings reported in this study. Second, given the limited evidence for lexical skills in children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + L I } ,$ , studies employing different lexical tasks (e.g., verbal fluency, definition generation, spontaneous speech generation) are called for, including tasks targeting internal state language. Third, an analysis of spontaneous speech during everyday activities, such as free play and peer conversations would offer a more accurate depiction of the diglossic manifestation and the spontaneous use of MSA among children with ASD. Fourth, implementing the tasks in MSA is needed to examine the interplay between both varieties, and whether proficiency in MSA positively influences the growth in SpA language skills. Lastly, further research is needed to investigate the link between the preference for MSA lexical items and differences in executive functions (e.g., inhibition, flexibility) in children with and without ASD while focusing on individual differences.

# 6. Conclusions and clinical implications

The current study represents one of the first steps into understanding the manifestation of diglossia in the lexical comprehension and production skills of PA-speaking children with and without ASD. Using a special coding rubric, it explores the role of diglossia by manipulating lexical affiliation with SpA and MSA in the receptive tasks, as well as testing children’s preferences for words in the two varieties in the production tasks. Our findings highlight that some children with ASD (i.e., $\mathrm { A S D + L I } )$ show impaired lexical skills, as evident in the reduced comprehension and production task scores, whereas others (i.e., $\mathrm { A S D + N L } )$ score on par with their TLD peers. Concerning the manifestation of diglossic lexical features, at a group level, children with TLD, $\mathrm { A S D + N L } ,$ and $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ presented the same pattern of favoring SpA lexical features over MSA ones. At the same time, few children exhibited extensive use of MSA words when exploring individual differences. This trend was more prevalent in children with $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ .

The data presented in this study holds significant theoretical and clinical implications. From a theoretical perspective, this study confirms the heterogeneity of lexical skills in children with ASD and provides novel insights into how the lexico-phonological distance in a diglossic context might influence the composition of the lexicon in children with ASD, as observed in the differences between $\mathrm { A S D + L I }$ and $\mathrm { A S D + N L }$ in the comprehension and production of lexical tasks. Consequently, the current study contributes to the scarce literature on the impact of diglossia on lexical abilities in Arabic-speaking children with ASD, and more generally to the cross-linguistic study of language in children with ASD.

From a clinical perspective, the study has important practical implications. First, the documentation of varying lexical skills in noun/verb comprehension and production in children with ASD is essential for the better provision of tailored language intervention plans, targeting the specific areas of difficulty. Second, when assessing lexical abilities of PA-speaking children with and without ASD in Arabic, it is important to consider the effect of the lexico-phonological distance between the children’s SpA dialect and MSA. Therefore, both varieties should be considered (SpA, MSA) to better characterize lexical skills in the context of Arabic diglossia. Last, clinicians should be aware of the potential competence and preference for MSA usage in informal contexts, in some, though not all, children with ASD regardless of their structural language skills, as this might point to pragmatic difficulties in these children.
