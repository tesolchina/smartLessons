Diverging from the long-held homogeneous view of academic discourse, the issue of disciplinarity has come to the forefront in EAP teaching and discourse analysis. Although disciplinary discourse is a well-established and expanding line of inquiry, there has been limited retrospective analysis to unpack its evolutionary nuances. This bibliometric study maps its evolution from 1990 to 2022, tracing its journey from a fringe component within applied linguistics and language pedagogy to a globally recognized field. Using 921 articles retrieved from the Web of Science's core collection, our analysis reveals enduring scholarly interest in disciplinary literacy, writing, and socialization, with a marked shift since 2006 towards exploring the interplay between disciplinary knowledgemaking practices and interpersonal features, such as stance, identity, and function. These studies, often using corpus approaches, highlight how these themes both reflect and are shaped by the disciplinary epistemology and ideology inherent in communities of practice. Emerging areas include student writing, spoken English, multimodal resources, and the temporal and interdisciplinary dynamics in various disciplines. The diverse authorship and geographical sources across various fields further underscore the global relevance of these topics. This overview could serve as a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and practitioners navigating this dynamic and significant field.

# 1. Introduction

Disciplinary discourse stands as a crucial concept for understanding the nuanced dynamics of knowledge-making and academic identity. The notion that language use varies across different discilines is now so wellestblished that ithas significantly influenced how educators and researchers approach language teaching and academic communication. Disciplinary discourse, in contrast to a monolithic view of academic discourse (Bhatia, 2014; Hyland, 2002) acknowledges and emphasizes the diversity of subject-specific literacies and rearch practices acros different dscipline sites. I i nessary to note that the i of discilinarit holds sinficant relevance for EAP and is akey concern for EAP practitioners (Hyland & Shaw, 2016; Thompson, 2023). Hence, our review is primarily focused on the EAP field.

Recognizing the unique linguistic characteristics, discursive expectations, and rhetorical conventions that characterize the discourse communities not only provides insight into the ways in which knowledge i constructed and negotiated, but also revealsthe underlying values and epistemologies that govern each discipline. As Hyland points out, to be effectively heard in academic circles "writers must display a competence as disciplinary insiders" (Hyland, 2005, p. 175) and mastering disciplinary ways of building arguments is"at the heart of conceptual understanding i any domain (Hyland, 2017,p. 21). Given that EAP is inherently grounded in and advances through the analysis of language variations (Hyland & Jiang, 2022b), seeing to understand disciplinary specificity and the rhetorical preferences that shape scholarly communities is of considerable interest to researchers of EAP. A substantial body of research has thus been dedicated to characterizing the field-specific strategies academics employ to convey disciplinary meanings and claim their membership, ultimately informing EAP teaching and learning.

Considering the centrality of disciplinary knowledge in EAP and more importantly, the ever-growing internationalization of EAP research (Hyland & Jiang, 2021a), athorough and cuing-edge review of disciplinarit reearch using a bibliometric lens can capture the prevailing interests and concerns within the field.

Additionally, it can trace its historical progression and identify gaps for future research, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of disciplinary discourse and its implications for the EAP field. Thus, we employ a bibliometric aroach to examine the literature on disciplinary discourse spanning three decades (1990-2022), studying the evolution of research topics, influential publications and authors, and geographical distribution. To understand the development and key players in this research field, we aim to address the following questions:

(1) What have been the most frequently explored topics and have these changed?   
(2) which authors have been most influential and have these changed?   
(3) Which publications have been most influential and have these changed?   
(4) Which countries/regions have been most productive in contributing to this research over the period and have these changed?

# 2. Disciplinary discourse: a brief overview

Academic discourse is not uniform or homogeneous, but rather a multitude of practices and strategies crafted within speific disciplines, each holding differing views on communication, persuasion, and reader engagement. This inricate landscape is where disciplinary discourse stems from; it is fundamentally based on the principle of specificity', which posits that disciplines can be perceived as academic tribes (Becher, 1989) or disciplinary groups with specialized norms, conventions, and methods of inquiry (MacDonald, 1992). This underscores the tangled connection between the nature of knowledge and the cultural underpinnings that shape different disciplinary communities. Such connections constitute the \*rules of the game" as described by Gerholm (1984), which scholars must master in order to demonstrate their expertise and construct a credible representation of themselves and their work" (Hyland, 2002, p. 1091).

Differences in fields of knowledge can be informed by the examination of language forms and rhetorical practices. Scholars make language choices to engage with others, make informed choices, express collgiality, and adres callenges in alignment with the community's shared beliefs and modes of discourse. Hyland (2015) contends that disciplines are language-using communities with varying research practices, and academic texts are tangiblerepresentations of these discipline-specific practices. Becher and Trowler (2001) also argue that it is, however, through the medium of language that some of the more fundamental distinctions emerge" (p. 46). Thus, while academic disciplines share a common goal in generating and disseminating knowledge, the lingustic realizations of this knowledge representation vary across isciplines and are subject to the discipline-specific values and epistemological traditions that govern them. As Bazerman observes:

I found that Icould not understand what constituted an appropriate text in any discipline without considering the social and intellectualactivity which the text was part of. Too much of the texts directly invoked and acted against these contexts to treat the features of texts simply as isolated conventions. Moreover, the rhetorical gist of entire texts evoked the larger framework of meanings within the active disciplines. That is I couldnt see what text was doing without loking at the worlds in which these texts served as significant activity (Bazerman, 1988, p. 4).

Despite the consensus that research on disciplinary discourse has become a highly fruitful topic over the decades (Gray, 2013; Hyland, Paltridge, & Wong, 2021; Thompson & Hunston, 2019), early investigations into academic discourse consistently perceived it as an undifferentiated domain, focusing on identifying common language features that transcended disciplinary boundaries (Bhatia 2002; Hood, 2010; Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002), or what Hutchinson and Waters (1987) call \*core inguistic resources that can be applied univerally across dfferent disciplines. This approach not only had theoretical implications but also responded to a practical need: the teaching of EAP to diverse, multidisciplinary student groups. However, critics argue that this homogeneous approach oversimplifies the complex nature of disciplinary discourse and neglects the role of subject-specific contexts in knowledge construction.

The turning point came with John Swales' influential work Genre Analysis (1990), which Hyland referred to as planting \*the sed" (2019, p. 25), for a deeper understanding of situated language use and how texts vary across disciplinary communities. Swales concepts of gere and discourse community offered a socially grounded framework for analyzing texts and contexts, emphasizing the importance of shared knowledge, rhetorical goals, and expectations in shaping communication practices. Against this background, researchers could understand how meaning is generated in interaction and how writers' rhetorical choices are affected by objecties, context, and target audience (Bhatia, 2004, 2014). This insightful perspective enables the examination of the complex interplay be. tween language choices and the broader social character of disciplines. It also sheds light on how the preferred strategie for crafting meanings both reflect and shape the norms and values within and across disciplinary communities.

The evolution of EAP research from an initial one-size-fit-all approach, which analyzed general principle of academic discourse, to embracing a more diferentiated approach that recognizes the significance of disciplinary variation, has greatly enriched the understanding of academic discourse. By adopting this more nuanced perspective, language educators and researchers can contribute to the development of more efective and contextuall relevant EAP pedagogy, suporting students in acquiring thir disciplinary voice" (Matsuda & Tardy, 2007) as they transition from novice status to that of disciplinary experts.

While numerous eforts have effectively sketched the landscape of academic discourse, one of the crucial concerns of EAP-the issue of disciplinarity--remains relatively unexplored within bibliometric contexts. Bibliometric studies include Hyland and Jiang's studies, which employed scientometrics to provide a systematic overview of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) (Hyland & Jiang, 2021a) and English for Specific Purposes (ESP) (Hyland & Jiang, 2021b). In addition to these broader fields, specific facets of EAP research have also been investigated, including genre analysis (Perez-Llantada, 2015), interaction in written discourse (Hyland & Jiang, 2022), and metadiscourse (Hyland & Jiang, 2022a). Studies have also systematically examined and reviewed papers published in specific journals, such as the flagship journals English for Specific Purposes (ESPJ), Journal of Second Language Writig (JSLW) and Jounal of English for Academic Purposes (JEAP) (Liu & Hu, 2021; Riazi et l., 2018, 2020). To track changes in EAP research over time, scholars have also incorporated papers from BALEAP proceedings volumes and accounts of Professional Issues Meeings (Charles, 2022). But, despite the extensive literature on EAP, key questions of disciplinarity remain unanswered: who the influential authors are, what topics are widely discussed, where these discussons take place, and when they gained momentum.

Responding to this pressing need for a detailed analysis, we employ bibliometric methods to examine relevant topics, methodol. ogies, key players, and cited works in Social Science Citation Index (scl journals from 1990 onwards. This year marks the beinning of the "modern age of ESP as described by Johns (2013), a period characterized by the emergence of multiple discipline-related concepts and a phase of significant academic evolution. By initiating our analysis at the point where academic discourse research is gaining momentum, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of his important area of inquiry, pinpoint potential avenues for future research, and enhance EAP pedagogy and disciplinary communication. We hope this systematic investigation will not only ddressthe current literature gap but also demonstrate the maturation of disciplinary discourse research as a central area of study.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Approach

Bibliometrics, as Borgman and Furner (2002) note resents "a powerful set of methods and measures for studying the structure and process f scholarly communication' (p. 2). Through citation analysis and statistical techniques, i identifies key authors, prevailing topics, and influential voice, therey presenting an overview of a given discipline (Ellegaard & Walli, 2015). As such, it proves to be an indispensable tool in tracking reearch trends and evaluating research productivity at both individual and national levels (Broadus, 1987). Bibliometric research contributes an empirically grounded understanding of academic fields and continues advancing methods for the systematic investigation of academic publication patterns and knowledge dissemination.

In general, the focus of bibliometric analysis has not been directed towards identifying the key research themes, authors, or publications within a discipline. However, this trend has sen exceptions in linguistics. For instance, Crosthwaite, Ningrum, and Lee (2022) conducted an analysis f three deades of Scopus-indexed reearch on L2 written corrective feedack Similarly, hang (2020) tracked shifts in second language acquisition research from 1997 to 2018. These studies underscore the value of bibliometric analysis as a quantitative tool to illuminate the evolution of their respective research fields.

# 3.2. Corpus

The method of our research commenced with the construction of a corpus, a collction of journal articles representative of the field under study. We turned or aention to the\*core collections of the We of Science (Wos) databases due to their inclusion f estemed journals lited in the Social Sciences Citation Index (sscil) and their well-established reputation as a valuable and extensively utilized library resource (Roemer & Borchardt, 2015). Other databases, such as Google Scholar and Scopus, do boast broader coverage, yet they lack the same stringent quality control we sought for our study. Google Scholar, a search engine that extends to the entirety of the internet, yields results based on machine-automated algorithms, potentiall lowering the reliabilit of its contents. Scopus suffr from inconsistent quality and includes non-peer-reviewed journals. The Wos, however, offers a curated selection of 12,o0 high-impact journals, ensuring a repository of over 79 million papers of notable academic value. Although sSCI-indexed papers may not cap. ture the full breadth of disciplinary discourse scholarship, they represent the work most esteemed within the community, thus potentially exerting substantial influence on this line of research.

In the next phase, we selected a search span from 1990 to 2022. The inception of the ssCl in 1990 played a significant role in this decision, allowing a consistent quality across our corpus. Additionally, we aimed to build upon major reviews, concluding in 2000 (Hewings, 2002; Swales & Leeder, 2012), whil providing a quantitative supplement to more impressionistic studies. This period is also noteworthy due to the publication of several influential works that significantly haped the views of discipline and the nature of academic discourse. For instance, Swales' Genre Analysis (1990), with its genre approach and community-based orientation to academic literacy, profoundly influenced the concept of discipline and fostered a disciplinary view of the world. Concurrently, both Becher's Academic Tribes and Teritories (1989) and Bazerman's Shaping Wrtten Knowledge (1988) transformed our understanding of how disciplinary knowledge is constructed. Following these development, English for Specific Purposes (ESP) entered a new phase of development, during which many key concepts were systematicall defined, extensively discussed, and progressvely implemented in discourse studies.

Finally, to ensure the relevance of the texts in our corpus, we devised a robust search string. This task involved searching for instances of phrases "disciplinary discourse, "disciplinary variation', "disciplinary difference", "variation across disciplines"

"disciplinesecific" and cross-diciplinary in the tites, astrcts, and sets of kwors across al the core clction fs journals We refined our search to encompass only those journals in the WoS categories of inguisics, education, and communication. This yielded 921 journal articles published from 1990 to 2022, with the distribution of these publications illstrated in Fig. 1. We downloaded all accompanying data for these papers, including tites, keywords, abstracts, reference ist, author names and afflations. For the purpose of our analysis, we have selected 2006 as a demarcation point as it represents the halfway mark between the initial year of 1990and the end year of 2022. The first period, from 1990 to 2006, comprises 108articles, and the second perio, from 2007 to 2022, contains 813 articles.

# 3.3. Data searches

We then delved into these two corpora to answer the questions, aiming to determine:

(1) The most frequently investigated topics between 1990 and 2022 (2) The most cited authors during this period (3) The most cited books, chapters and articles in disciplinary discourse research (4) The nations/regions with the highest research output over the past thirty years

To address the first research question, about the topics, the following steps were undertaken:

1) Allabstracts extracte from the corpus were anotated with part-of-speech and lemma information by leraging Schmid's (1995) TreeTagger software.   
2) The tagged corpora were searched to identify allnouns and n-grams ranging from 2 to 5 words using AntConc (v. 4.2.0, Anthony, 2022), with the aim of pinpointing potential topics.   
3) An automated method (using stop words) was utilized to omit function words (e.g., modals, prepositions) from the n-grams, considering that they are less likely to appear in research topic phrases.   
4) Allremaining instances were manually reviewed to discard phrases that do not qualify as topics.

Nouns were selected to identify potential subject areas as they are far more likely to constitute research topics compared to ad. jectives, adverbs, and verbs. Furthermore, we deemed 2 to 5-word n-grams a feasible range to encompass topics such as disciplinary writing (2-word gram) and English for research publication purposes (5-word gram). We then manually removed three primary categories of monograms and n-grams: a frequently appearing words and clusters in general language (abiliy to and in terms o), b) concepts and issues that are not exclusive to disciplinary discourse (Chi-square Analysis number of, implications of, th preent study), c) notions and issues that, although prevalent in discilinary discourse, are too broad to be usful (iversity students and hard- and soft-science). This method aligns with the approach employed by Lei and Liu (2019).

Topics were selected for inclusion in our analysis only if they reached a minimum frequency of 10 occurrences. This selection process, while somewhat subjective, was informed by the insights of Lei and Liu (2019) and Hyland and Jiang (2021b). They established athreshold frequency of 30ccurrence, striking a balance that ensure the sinificancef chosen topics whil avoiing the exclusion of important ones. Given that our study focuses on a more specialized area with a relatively smalle corpus size (921 versus 10,000 artices), we adjusted the frequency criterion to include items that appeared at least 10 times, which le to  suitable number of meaningful instances. Having identified the topics, we took the next step of frequency normalization, reresenting the occurrences of each topic per 100 papers. This normalization aimed to facilitate comparisons between time periods with vastly diffring numbers of papers.

To answer questions 2, 3, and 4 regarding the most influential authors, works, and the most productive countries/regions, we first identified the authors who appeared most frequently in the references of the papers in each corpus through a frequency count. To determine which publications ganered the most citations, we calculated the frequencies of ll types of referenced works, including books, chapters, and articles listed in the reference lis in the corpus. This was accomplished by implementing a regular expression search to pinpoint the abbreviated tite. For our fourth question concening the countries/egions with the highest research output, we retried the institutional affliationof l author of every paper in the corpora. Finaly, the first two authors worked independently and achieved an inter-rater agreement of $9 4 \%$ on the most explored topics, $9 5 \%$ on publications and authors, and $9 8 \%$ on the most productive countries/regions. Disagreements were subsequently resolved through discussion.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. The most frequently studied topics

In this section, we present the results of our analysis of research topics in disciplinary discourse research spanning over three decades. For this analysis topics" encompas not only the subject matter under investgation but also the methodologies employed to examine those ubjects, thereby incorporating both topics and methods. The criteri outlined in Section 3.3, specificall those with a minimum of 10 occurrences, resulted in 159 frequently discussed research themes over the past $^ { 3 0 + }$ years. Table 1 displays the changes in frequency of these topics, providing both raw and normed values for each period.

Fig. 1. Distribution of the number of publications across time.

It is evident that several themes have ascended in prominence over the years, with gere, writer, identit, function, and stance registering substantial increases exceeding $1 5 0 \%$ . The surge in these recurring themes suggests a move towards a more socially situated and discursively oriented perspective in disciplinar reearch discourse. This thematic shft fins resonance with Bhatia's (2002) observations on the development of linguistic analysis in ESP, which transitioned from an initial focus on lexico-grammar features to the study of discourse structure and eventuall, to an emphasis on the broader social and contextual aspects of language.

Central to these studies are inquiries into how community members position themselves in relation to both the status of their propositions and the audiences they address Such inquiries underscore the importance of connecting texts with social practices, bringing to light key isues such as power dynamics and the politics of language use (Bruce & Bond, 2022; McGrath & Kuteeva, 2012). This transition "from text to what makes a text possible' (Bhatia, 2002, p. 21) also helps to elucidate why members of specific disciplinary cultures use language in certain ways and what enables this specific form of language use.

This upward trend is further reinforced by the decreased emphasis on traditional language teaching topics such as ESL, foreign language, language acquisition, classoom, and courses. This decline hints at a broader shift in disciplinary research domains, moving beyond the classrom teaching needs to engage more deeply with the intricate dynamics of community, identity, and ideology within the discursive sphere. The diminishing popularit of these topics aligns with the broader trend in applied linguistics and EAP, which seeks to unravel the complex roles and identities of all participants involved in discourse practices (Hyland, 2010).

Interestingly, the term science has sn a notable decline in disciplinary discourse studies, indicating a potential expansion in focus beyond the confines of traditionally examined hard sciences. This trend could be a response to the evolving academic landscape, characterized by the emergence of interdisciplinary research (Thompson & Hunston, 2019) and the gradual integration of diverse knowledge domains. Thus, the reduced emphasis on science may mark an exciting phase of diversification in disciplinary discourse research.

The terms genre and corpus frequently appear on the list, emphasizing their crucial role in disciplinary studies. They are not necessarily investigated as standalone topics, but more so in relation to their impact on disciplinary discourse. The rise in corpus studies likely reflects advancements in technology and increased availability of digital text corpora. Corus approaches facilitat largescale analysis of academic texts and provide empirical evidence to identify discourse patterns and variations, thus occupying a central role in modern ESP, as noted by Paltridge and Starfield (2013). Genres, though viewed as conventionalized constructs, are reflections of the unique cultures inherent in specific disciplines (Hyland, 2015). The interplay between genres and disciplines in academic discourse i complex and dynamic, as Bhatia (2002) identifes several key dimensions to this relationship: genres that are unique to specific disciplines, geres that extend across multipledisciplines, inra-disciplinary tensions arisig from genre variations, and the existence of genres with similar textual features but divergent functional usages. This strategic deployment of genre resources by members within disciplines has sparked increased scholarly interest, particularly in the latter period.

Table 2 llustrates the themes that have remained consistent in stistical analyses across al periods. The enduring focus on writing instruction, disclinary literacy, and soclization exmplifies the fields commment to equipping students with the sills to acquire the specialized discourse competencies for discipline-specific writing tasks and ways of thinking (Hyland, 2002; Hyland & Jiang, 2018) Given the inherent pedagogical orientation in EAP, it is unsurprising to see these topics as the recurrent ones over the entire period. This trend bears testament to the field's dedication to tacklig tangible educational challenges and facilitating student success within disciplinary learning environments. Prioritizing students' nees and their challenges in acquiring academic literacy agrees with Swales' recent call (2019, p. 76) for a reduction in studies with "no useful pedagogical import".

New frontiers of inqury into the nature of disciplinary research discourse are evidenced by themes that have surfaced since 2007, as outlined in Table 3. These themes, due to their imited preence or complete absence in prior work, have een identified as emerging ones. Their emergence conveys the understanding that disciplinary discourses are not rigid or prescriptive forms, but rather dynamic constructions that are continuously shaped and renegotiated by the participants involved (Jiang, 2019). Whilestillcomprising a relatively small percentage of total research output, thir growing presence highlights the increased recognition of the multifaceted nature of disciplinary discourse and the necessity of exploring it from various perspectives.

Multimodal analysis and Longitudinal study might represent an expansion of research methods well-suited to grasp the multifarious, dynamic communication and meaning construction within disciplinary discourse. The aplication of multimodal analysis allows re searchers to understand how meaning i created through the integration of diverse modes of expression-not just language, but images, sounds, and other sense-making systems. Researchers have also increasingly turned their focus towards the temporal aspects of disciplinary discourse, indicating a departure from a static view of discourse by capturing how meaning and interactions evolve over time.

Student writing and spoken English are also on the ist, sugesting a broadening focus from an earlier emphasis on texts written by expert writers and formal specialized written discourse. Attention to disciplinary features in novice writing directly addresses student needs and informs the development of learning materials. In the same vein, examining how disciplinary orientations manifest in informal and highly contextualized spoken practices is vital for students and novice researchers to acquire \*interactional iteracy' (Crawford Camiciottoli, 2007, p. 184).

The use of English as a lingua franca has also come to the forefront as a recent theme in disciplinary research domains, emphasizing the importance of studying disciplinary norms and practices in globalised, multilingual discursive spheres as opposed to within homogeneous and hierarchical contexts (Mauranen, Hynninen, & Ranta, 2010). Likewise, nterdisciplinary communication, seeking to transcend the boundaries of discrete disciplines, endorses a heterogeneous and horizontal approach (Rhoten, 2004), and addesses interdisciplinary audiences from multiple disciplinary domains. The emergence of interdisciplinary research discourse also concurs with Thompson's (2023) observation that as interdisciplinary studies become more prevalent in higher education, research geared towards interdisciplinary audiences gains critical importance. As facilitators i scientific discourse, interdisciplinary research bridges divergent or convergent concepts and ways of thinking. Thus, such studies have become crucial for academia and policymaking, due to their vital role in addressing global challenges and facilitating integrated insights (Ng, 2022). Traditional disciplinary-oriented research largely focuses on comparing hard and soft sciences and often neglects interdisciplinary data. Recent attention to inter disciplinarity, however, suggests a promising departure from the "comparing disciplines" model (Thompson & Hunston, 2019, p. 243), towards fostering interdisciplinary practices and knowledge exchange.

In addition to the broader changes oserved in rearch on disciplinary discourse, the analysi of pecific linguistic features, such as phrase-frmes and ynctic complexity, provide urther evidence of this shift. The analysis of theeelements indicat  otential move away from an earlier dominance of lexical or phraseological features and towards an examination of more nuanced and complex structures. This shift in focus is evident in the burgeoning body of crossdisciplinary research, exemplified by studies conducted by Lu et al. (2021) and Nekrasova-Beker (2019). These studies underscore the high sensitivity of phrase-frames and syntactic complexity to disciplinary regularities, and further highlight the impact of sophisticated computational tols on examining these linguistic features. In sum, the recent spotlight on these topics highlights the increasing diversty of approaches through which knowledge is disseminated within and across domains of specialization. These topics, not emphasized in earlier periods, have gained a growing presence in more recent times. While we cannot conclusively say these topics have emerged as active research areas due to the relatively smallvolume of research contributions, this does not necessarily mean they lack significance or potential value as a line of inquiry. This is much like the exploration of discoursal differences within the same discipline, often referrd to as intra-disciplinary variation'. Although this topic does not feature on our list it is certainly a strand of interet and has garnered strong advocacy from scholars in EAP (Gray, 2015; Hyland & Jiang, 2022b; Shirazizadeh & Amirfazlian, 2021). Hence, it s crucial for disciplinary research and teaching to recognize the significance of these topics in future work.

# 4.2. Who are the most cited authors?

Key to the evolution of these themes have been the contributions of prominent authors. To identify these celebrity scholars, we performed a frequency count of the reference lists in our corpus of 921 research artice. We then divided these articles into two timeframes: pre- and post-2006 and normalized the results to 100 papers. Table 4 displays the leading 13 authors in each period, including their raw and normalized citation counts.

Interestingly, nearly half of the authors are cited frequently in both periods, indicating the enduring impact of key early scholars as well as the rise of a cadre of influential figures shaping the identity of the field. Among these notable authors, Swales, Hyland, Bazerman and Flowerdew stand out s prominent voices spearheading and defining the studies of disciplinary discourse. Other major figures over the $^ { 3 0 + }$ years are the pioneering systemic functional inguist Michael Halliday, and the influential UK sociologist Tony Becher. Their collctive contributions have fundamentall transformed our understanding of isues related to disciplinary specificity and exerted a profound influence on the field's development over the span of more than 30 years.

Throughout both periods, Hyland takes center stage as a trailblazing figure in the study of disciplinary discourse, socio-culturally situated disciplinary communities and scholarly identity. No discussions about disciplinary language distinctiveness would be complete without acknowledging Ken Hyland's profoundly influential concepts and analytical frameworks. Recognized as the most cited scholar in EAP over the past two decades (Hyland & Jiang, 2021a), Hyland sees the study of isiplinary variations i litracy practices as a conerstone of his own career-defining reearch agenda. Swales, right fter Hyland in the earlier list, underscores the significance of genres as the nexus between individuals and communities. His visionary concepts of genre, discourse community, task, and rhetorical consciousness raising are central in researching academic writing and have propelled the flegling field of EAP towards disciplinary status' (Hyland, 2022, p. 2), despite not being directly recognized as an advocate for disciplinary discourse.

Much research, especiall in the last 15 years, on disciplinary variation extensively draws upon Becher's (1989) disciplinary mapping frameworks. Becher's systematic taxonomy provides a structured approach for understanding the relationship between disciplinary cultures and the ways in which knowledge is produced and disseminated in academia. Charles Bazerman is renowned for his exploration of writing within socio-historical contexts, particularly underscoring the pivotal role of discipline in shaping written knowledge. He emphasizes the crucial connection between knowledge creation and notable epistemological and cultural variations, as manifested in how writers engage with disciplinary litrature, employ accepted modes of argumentation, and present themselves in their texts. This perspective has formed the foundation for considerable research and theory in the areas of disciplinary writing and disciplinary rhetorical preferences in academic interactions.

John Flowerdew's research interests span critical discourse analysis, active istening, higher education, and discourse analysis. Yet, he is notably recognized for his emphasi on discipline-specific writing as a crucia skil for students, curriculum development, and the theory and practice of subject-based teaching strategies. This has broadened our understanding of language use in specific contexts and students' adherence to discilinary conventions and belief. Halliday's influence, f course, i evident in the goundbreaking thory of Systemic Functional Linguistics. This widely adopted framework for analyzing various language functions has greatly facilitated the interpretation of meaning-making practices in written and spoken communication.

In the earlier phase, scholars typically employed interpretive methodologies to analyze individual text across multiple disciplines, with a strong emphasis on case study and ethnographic techniques. Early work of this type primarily emphasizes the social construction of academic discourse and students' socialization within their academic disciplines. Prominent figures in this area include Charles Bazerman, whose work we have previously discussed, along with Paul Prior, Carol Berkenkotter, Greg Myers and Ilona Leki. Prior's ethnographic research, for instance, is significant in understanding that disciplinary practices are contingent, rather than homogeneous, static, or devoid of conflict, as they are continuously negotiated and renegotiated within the context of power dynamics and diverse social relationships. Drawing extensively from case study data, Berkenkottr has eaned recognition for her sociocognitive exploration of the role of genres in disciplinary communication and the acquisition and application of genre knowledge in the knowledge production activities. Likewise, Greg Myers is best-known for his focus on the societal dimensions of scientific texts, addressing elements like politeness, cohesion, narrative structure and illustrations using the framewors of sociology of scientific knowledge. Leki's longitudinal ethnographic studies on second language academic literacy, istinguished by their breadth and depth, offer an in-depth account of, not ust the linguistc difficulties, ut alo the multifaceted and complex challenges that student writers encounter in their acquisition of discipline-specific literacy, such as identity formation, socio-academic relationship dynamics, and motivational factors.

H.G. Widdowson, although not specificall focused on disciplinary discourse, has influenced the field with his emphasis on communicative language teaching, the teaching of ESP, and intruction in scientific discourse. This underscores not only the pedagogical orientation of disciplinary discourse research but alsois inherent interdisciplinary nature, a testament to the broad applicability of his contributions. Further enriching the field are the works of Geoff Thompson and Avon Crismore. Thompson's contributions in Systemic-Functional Linguistics particularly his theories on interaction and evaluation, along with Crismores studies on metadiscourse and rhetoric, have all enhanced our understanding of these linguistic aspects in different disciplines.

An interesting development is the rising prominence of Douglas Biber. Absent in the frs period, Biber amases 591 citations in the second, indicating the growing impact of corpus linguistics on disciplinary discourse research. Corpus analysis has been instrumental in identifying a range of language and rhetorical features that differentiate various disciplinary lines.

Of these corpus studies, Ken Hyland's exhaustive research into citation practice, evaluation, and metadiscourse in an array of genres, ranging from research artice, textbooks to book reviews, has been a significant catalyst for a wave of cross-disciplinary inestigations. Reearchers such as Charles, renowned for her work on stance in thees; Samraj, estmed for her insights into rhetorical moves in research article part-genres and statements of purpose in graduate program applications; Harwood's study of the use of personal pronouns and citations in research articles; and Hu's studies on metadiscourse, citation in research articles, and rhetorical moves in 3-min thesis presentations, have all ridden this wave.

Vijay Bhatia's genre research in ESP, particularly in professional settings outside academia, has encouraged the study of disci. plinary language use in workplace discourses. Martin's work, conducted within functional linguistic and sociological perspectives, has also attracted interest among disciplinary researchers. Each of these scholars, in their distinctive ways, have enriched our under. standing of disciplinary discourse, contributing to the diversity and depth of the field.

# 4.3. Most influential publications

Underpinning this study is the assumption that the publications most cited within a given period wield the greatest influence. In academic research, citations serve as a conventional way to credit the origins of methodologies, concepts, and interretations, and are frequently used as a broad indicator of a paper's significance. However, citation counts are not immune to distortions. Factors such as self-citation, negative citations, research expansion, and the age of publications can skew these counts (Cooper, 2015). As such, bibliometric experts tend to avoid relying solely on citation counts to evaluate a paper's merit opting instead to compare the citation counts of papers of similar publication age, as suggested by Cooper in 2015. That being said, our study has a unique focus. We aim to chart the evolution of the field and understand the impact of seminal publications on this trajectory, fully recognizing that more recent papers might be underrepresented due to their rececy. Our analysis focused on identifying the most frequently cited publications and calculating both raw and normed citation frequencies for each period. The 18 most significant indings from this analys are displayed in Tables 5 and 6.

It is noteworthy that books primarily constitute the top 36 most-cited titles, with 11 from both thefirst and second periods. This stands in contrast to the bibliometric analyses of metadiscourse research by Hyland and Jiang (2022a), which shows a predominance of research articles. Despite the immediate visibility that research artices provide to authors-an aspect increasingly emphasized by institutions for government accounting purposes only 7 articles make it on each list. It apears that monographs, rather than articles, tend to house the most influential and enduring works in disciplinary discourse.

Most of the authors discussed in the prior section feature prominently inthe bibliometric rankings for the most cited publications over two distinct periods. Notable new entrants include G. Nigel Gilbert & Michael Mulkay, Roz Ivanic, Brent Bridgeman & Sybil Carlson, Daniel M. Horowitz, and Ruth Spack in the irst period, with Averil Coxhead, along with Hilary Nesi & Sheena Gardner in the subsequent period. Gilbert & Mulkay's Opening Pandora's box presents a novel sociological approach to analyzing scientific discourse, and Ivanic's Writing and Identt highlights how writig, a an act of identity expression, aligns with socio-cultual positions and plays a role in shaping and challenging societal norms, beliefs, and practices.

Bridgeman & Carlson, Horowitz, and Spack's works collectively address the nature of academic writing tass and the question of how EAP teaching should be approached. Comprehensive surveys conducted by Bridgeman & Carlson, and Horowitz, underscore considerable variabilit in the demands of academic writing tass across diffrent fields. Spack, in contrast, argues that the re. sponsibilit for discipline-specific writing instruction should rest with teachers of the respective disciplines. She advocates for a focus on general principle of inquiry, hetoric, and writing from sources, a stance often labeled as a\*wide angle perspective (Hyland, 2002, p. 387). However, this perspective has not been unchllenged. Several researchers in ESP, including Johns (1988), Braine (1988), and Hyland (2002), have disputed the notion of deferring the teaching of discipline-specific writing conventions to subject matter experts. This debate highlights the evolving nature of EAP and the uncertain status it occupied during its earlier stages.

Averil Coxhead's A new academic word it was compiled from a corpus of 3.5 million running words of written academic text. The Academic Word List (AwL) is believed to hold considerable relevance for students engaged in academic learning and has inspired numerous research endeavors aimed at creating technical ocabulary lists tailored for specific fields of study. Hilary Nesi & Sheena Gardner's Genres across th disciplines draws on the British Academic Written English corpus and examines the genres of asessed writing across diverse disciplines in higher education. The book i valuablefor practitioners seeking to provide targeted academic writing suport, as well a rearchers interestd in analyzing academic discourse and the influence f disciplinary practie on writing expectations.

Out of the 36 publications listed in the two tables, the authors of 14 publications make a singular appearance, while others feature recurrnly. John wales, fr instance, has thr f his works appearing i both sets of data. This prealene sres as a testment to his fundamental influence in language use and communication practice in academic settings, highlighting his valuable role in understanding rhetrical variations across ifferent fids of study. Douglas Biber, anther influential figure is featred in both table. He is well known for co-authoring the groundbreaking Longman grammar of spoken and writen English with Stig Johansson, Geoffrey Leech, Susan Conrad, and Edward Finegan. This corpus-based grammatical description has not only expanded learners' understanding of grammar but also significantly influenced linguistic studies of English up to the present day. Building on this seminal work, Biber, along with Conrad and Cortes, turned their focus to the building blocks of discourse-lexical bundles. Biber's frequency-driven approach to identifying these extended collocations has laid a solid foundation, spurring researchers to explore these lexical sequences in diffeent disciline, thus enriching the iscourse analytic reearch in divers ways. Furthermore, Iodction to Functionl Grammar by Michael Halliday is included in both lis, signifying the critical importance of his work in disciplinary practices. The significance of understanding genre knowledge through a socio-cultural lens is also evident in disciplinary communication, as demonstrated by the inclusion of works by Carol Berkenkotter and Thomas N. Huckin in both lists.

Disciplinary Discourses, a monograph by Hyland in 200, appears at the top of two lists, indicating it significant standing in disciplinary discourse research. Further emphasizing his prolific contrbutions are eight pivotal research artices in two lists. These studies delve into varied linguistic aspects such as metadiscourse, citation practices, lexical bundes, self-mention, academic persuasion, and evaluative language in abstracts. Consistently acknowledged in scholarly circles, these works have transformed our perception of academic writig It is no longer sn as simply a means f representing external reality, but rather as a way of skilfully constructing and negotiating social relations, building a credible self-image, and aligning writers with their disciplinary-oriented expectations and identities.

An interesting instance on the lis is the dual apearance of the same publication, initilly authored by Becher in 1989, and later the revised second edition by Becher and Trowler in 2001. The new version adapts to the evolving landscape of higher education and addresses the emerging challenges faced by academics. Quite often, Becher's dichotomies f hard" and \*soft" and \*pure" and "applied' are employed to guide the selection of materials for disciplinary variation research and interpret the results. These narratives, which explore academic self-percetion and the interplay between academic cultures and disciplines, serve as a crucial resource for those engaged in disciplinary culture and communication.

# 4.4. Most productive countries/regions

Scholarly publishing is undergoing a gradual yet monumental shift on a global scale, transitioning from traditional Western dominance to a broader, more diverse landscape. This transformation, fueled by the rise of online publishing, globalization, iner. national research collaborations, the \*publish or perish' culture, and significant investments in research, has enabled more aca demics--often non-native English peakersto participate in this endeavor (Hyland, 2023). Consequently, the academic landscape has become more varied, as evidenced by an incrase in the number of journals, rearchers, reearch papers, publishers, and instances of international co-authorship. This trend becomes evident when examining the afiliatios of authors in our data, indicating a wider participation of countries beyond the traditional English-speaking regions. Table 7 lists the top 10 productive countries/regions in disciplinary discourse research over the past $^ { 3 0 + }$ years, determined by the affiliation of each author in the corpus.

While the United States continues to have the highest number of publications, there has been a noticeable shift in the landscape o contributions to the feld of disciplinary discourse. The United Kingdom continues to be an active contributor. China, inlusive of Hong Kong, has seen a remarkable surge in output over the years. Other countries or regions, such as Spain, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, and Singapore, have emerged as noteworthy contributors, replacing previous mainstays like Italy, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and Belgium.

This shift is particularly pronounced in the case of China, which has witnessed a remarkable increase in output. The growth has been largely facilitated by the government's extensive investment in research. China's research and development (R&D) expenditure skyrocketed to $\$ 554$ billion in 2018, with the ambitious future goal of allocating $2 . 5 \%$ of the country's GDP to R&D (Koshikawa, 2020). The government's strategic investment in top universities has fostered a globally recognized, research-led universit system. This sizable investment has led to China moving from 14th to 1st position in world output, overtaking the United States in 2020 and now producing almost a ifh ofall pr-reviewed papers in Science Citation Index (SCI) journals (Koshikawa, 2020). As for contributions to disciplinary discourse, Table 7 illstrates that China's contributions closely follow those of the USA, with respective proportions of $2 4 . 1 \%$ and $2 4 . 8 \%$ . This figure also signifies a substantial increase in China's contributions, which have doubled from a previous rate of $1 0 . 2 \%$ to the current $2 4 . 1 \%$

It is important to note that our observations are based on author afiliations, not nationality or ethnic background. The global diaspora of academics often results in authors being afiliated with institutions outside their home countries. Despite this consideration, the internationalization of academic publishing is undeniable. Authors from diverse global locations are contributing to disciplinary discourse, underscoring the field's significance and the increasing diversity of its contributors.

# 5. Conclusion

Language use exhibits considerable variability, not just acrosgenres, modes, and cultures, but also across disciplines. This study has applied bibliometric methods totrack a crucial and transformative era in the disciplinary research discourse, spanning from 1990 to 2022. Initially perceived as a valuable, albeit potentially peripheral, component of applied linguistis and language pedagogy, the study of disciplinary discourse emerged in response to the notion of academic discourse as a monolithic, universallytransferable, and uniform entity across disciplines. Throughout this period, research in disciplinary discourse has flourished, transcending its early confines, and maturing into a field of worldwide significance.

Our data indicates a sustained scholarly interest in themes centered around disciplinary literacy, writing, and socialization. However, since 2006, several topics have focused specifically on interconnections between disciplinary knowledge-building practices and rhetorical constructs like gere, writer identty, function, and stance. In these studies, rearchers have often empoyed corpus and genre approaches to examine how these features reflect the disciplinary orientations and encode rhetorical preferences embedded within the communities of practice. Looking forward, we anticipate an expansion in research that highlights the disciplinary dimensions of arenas such as student writing, spoken English, and the impact of discipline on the usage of syntactic complexity and multimodal resources. We also anticipate an increased interest in studie examining the temporal dynamics of isciplinarity, as well as the influences of interdisciplinarit on discourse research. Such research willyield a fuller understanding of how and why members of specific disciplinary cultures use language the way they do.

Our findings also identify a core group of prolific authors who have provided a multitude of research evidence for the concept of disciplinary specificit. Over the period, ther publications have ben frequently cited and have pushed the frontier of this concept in discourse analysis and language pedagogy, continuing to exert influence as the scope f research expands. This line of inquiry, far from lingering on the periphery, has attained global significance, as authors afiliated with emerging research hubs are shaping its growth.

Interpreting publishing and citation data, as we have in this bibliometric study, can provide a general,abeit somewhat limited. snapshot of a field that is, in reality, highly nuanced and complex. Echoing Hyland and Jiang's (2021a) observations, our examination also privileges the cream of the crop' --the authors and works that have garnered considerable citations and recognition. But, by focusing on these high-flyers, we may overook the quieter, perhaps les recognized yet influential contributor. These may include those engaged in regional, local, and practtioner-led research, or those publishing in languages ther than English. This broad body of work, however, is almost certainly influenced by the research we have discussed in this study. Moreover, the multifaceted nature of academic disciplines, compounded by the unique nuances of individual reearch practices, suggests that our quantitative bibliometric methods may not fully capture the qualitative aspect or the full diversty of the field. These aspects may be considered limitations of our study, but also opportunities for future research to illuminate the les visible yet equall valuable contributions to our feld.
