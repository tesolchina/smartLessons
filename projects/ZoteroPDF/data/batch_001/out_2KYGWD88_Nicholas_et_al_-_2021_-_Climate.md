Climate change is the greatest public health threat of the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century and is associated with environmental degradation and deleterious health consequences. In 2019, the Lancet Commission Report on Health and Climate Change: Ensuring that the Health of a Child Born Today Is Not Defined By a Changing Climate (Watts et al., 2019) examined the critical health issues that children will face in the era of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) are responsible for an alarming increase in the warming of the planet, shifts in weather patterns, loss of arable land, and exacerbations of acute health issues, chronic health problems, and disaster-related health consequences. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of climate change and the associated deleterious health consequences in our climate-changing world. The paper will also examine the stages of political development to advance the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century role of the nursing profession in climate and health advocacy and policy.

# Introduction

In 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) attributed climate change “. . .directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods” (UNFCCC, 1992, p.2). Since then, there has been broad international consensus that anthropogenic activities have led to significant increases in GGEs resulting in the warming of the earth’s surface (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2014a; UNFCCC, 1992). These planetary changes have subsequent negative impacts on the environment and human health and well-being (Watts et al, 2015; World Health Organization [WHO], 2015). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an organization established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Association is comprised of scientists from over 120 countries. The IPCC offers a comprehensive assessment of scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information relevant to climate change to inform a global audience, including scientists, policymakers, government officials, and the public (IPCC, nd). The critical efforts of the IPCC have galvanized leadership to address climate change and its intersection with health.

# Overview of Recent Climate Assessments and Health Impacts of Climate Change

Although early engagement of global citizens regarding the impact of climate change and health was equivocal, recent national and international reports suggest that there is a broad consensus and agreement that climate change is a grave concern in the US and globally (UNFCCC, 1992; IPCC, 2014b; Watts et al., 2019). In 2015, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was adopted by 196 countries with an ambitious goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increases to an even more ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Of concern is that the US government withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2020. However both public and scientific discourse related to climate change are increasing with scientific papers published in nursing, medicine, and other health professions journals. Additionally, there has been growing attention to the negative health impacts of climate change. For example, newspaper coverage of climate change and health—the increase in numbers of articles published—has increased by $78 \%$ globally since 2007 (Watts et al., 2017).

The Lancet Countdown tracks progress specifically on health impacts related to our changing climate and offers an assessment of the health effects of climate change on the environment. Further the Lancet Countdown provides data country by country which offers a significant contribution to the global and national lens of climate impacts on health. The impetus for this work arose from the conclusions of the report of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change (Watts et al., 2017). Notably, the authors argue that anthropogenic climate change may threaten the past 50 years of public health gains in all areas of health. Further, they argue that a comprehensive response to climate change may be the greatest global health opportunity of the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century (Watts et al., 2015). The most recent Lancet Countdown report (Watts et al., 2019) suggests that: “a child born today will experience a world that is more than four degrees warmer than the pre-industrial average, with climate change impacting human health from infancy and adolescence to adult and old age” (p.1836). The Lancet reports are based on an international, multidisciplinary collaboration, dedicated to monitoring the evolving health profile of climate change, and providing an assessment of the delivery of climate change commitments made by governments under the Paris agreement.

It is well established that the risk of exposure and vulnerability to the effects of climate change are unequally distributed (Haines & Ebi, 2019; Lemery, Williams, & Farmer, 2014). Resilience to the impacts of climate change are socially, culturally, and economically determined, leaving the most socioeconomically disadvantaged such as communities of color, indigenous populations, women and children, the elderly, and those with chronic illnesses as the most vulnerable (Boeckmann & Zeeb, 2016). From a perspective of climate justice, countries and regions of the world that have least contributed to greenhouse gas emissions— poor and resource-limited settings—are those most affected by negative health consequences, thus climate injustice exists worldwide.

It is important to note that in recent literature, addressing climate and health with a lens on the United Nations Sustainable Development (UN SDGs), there has been a focus from a public health nursing perspective (Lilienfeld, Nicholas, Corless, & Breakey, 2017; Nicholas, Breakey, & Rosa, 2019; Rosa, Schenk,

Travers, & Nicholas, 2019) (Table 1). An opportunity exists for nurses to collaborate with leaders across disciplines and health sectors to address the deleterious health effects of climate change and to optimize mitigation and adaptation strategies to improve climate change resilience of communities and populations. Another important area from a policy and advocacy perspective is the important role of nurses to integrate climate change communication in clinical settings with patients, education of communities in public health settings, education for students from undergraduate, graduate, and post-professional and continuing education for nurses.

The purpose of this paper is to examine climate change and its impact on health and to explore the concept of climate justice, a concept that makes explicit the moral dimensions of climate change. In addition, the paper offers an explication and application of stages of nursing’s political development (Cohen, Mason, Kovner, Leavitt, Pulcini, & Sochalski, 1996) to nursing’s role in leadership for climate advocacy. A focus on climate policy efforts, climate advocacy, and the role of nurses in addressing climate and health through the lens of nursing’s stages of political development will also be explored.

# Impact of Global Warming and Climate Change on Health and Well-being

Since the late ${ 1 9 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ century, the average surface temperature of the earth has risen approximately 2 degrees Fahrenheit and most of this warming has occurred over the past 35 years (National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA], nd). Global warming is due in large part to an increase in GGEs, which collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation. These GGEs include water vapor, which increases as the earth warms leading to increased clouds and precipitation; carbon dioxide resulting from deforestation and burning fossil fuels; methane resulting from agriculture, decomposition of landfill waste, and ruminant digestion and manure management of livestock; nitrous oxide resulting from commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, and biomass burning; and fluorinated gases (NASA, nd). In the US, the biggest culprits of GGEs are coal-burning power plants and emissions related to the transportation industry. Notably the United States (US) has emitted more GGEs than any other country until recently when China surpassed US emissions.

An increase in average global temperature has resulted in shifts in normal climate patterns, and these in turn have had led to negative impacts on health and wellbeing. The relationship between climate change and health is complex. The IPCC (2014b) categorizes the health impacts of climate change using the following categories: direct effects, ecosystem-mediated effects, and health impacts mediated through human institutions. Direct effects are related to extreme weather and the increasing frequency and severity of heat waves, droughts, storms, floods, and rising sea levels, which are a threat to coastal cities and island nations, specifically. For example, health impacts related to rising temperatures lead to heat stroke, heat stress, and death, particularly in those with preexisting health conditions, as well as an increase in cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney-related events. Floods and storms can result in traumatic injury, drowning, and spread of vector-borne and water-borne infectious disease (IPCC, 2014b). Ecosystem-mediated impacts of climate change include a wider distribution and increased burden of vector-borne and water borne infectious disease as well as sequelae related to poor air quality and allergic disease (IPCC, 2014a). Lastly, undernutrition from crop failure, occupational health risk associated with heat strain, disaster-related psychiatric trauma as well as violence, conflict, and population migration are mediated through human institutions (IPCC, 2014b; Watts et al., 2017; 2019). Watts and colleagues (2017) suggest that undernutrition may be the largest health impact of climate change in the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century. Figure 1 illustrates the complex dynamics among human health and well-being and the negative health impacts associated with climate change.

# Impact of Climate Change on Vulnerable Individuals and Populations

Vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change is determined by three factors: exposure to one or more biological, psychosocial, chemical, or physical stressors; sensitivity or the degree to which people or communities are affected; and adaptive capacity, the ability to adjust, take advantage of opportunities and respond to consequences of climate-related events (US Global Change Research Program [USGCRP], 2016). Further, vulnerability to health risks associated with climate change are dependent on social determinants of health—the social, political, cultural, and economic circumstances in which one resides. Populations that are disproportionately disadvantaged or discriminated against have limited resources and fewer opportunities for health-promoting behaviors and overall well-being, particularly in our climate-changing world. Those populations living in areas with poorly maintained infrastructure, less access to health care services, and less than optimal living and working conditions (USGCRP, 2016) are most vulnerable. However vulnerability exists in resource rich countries where vulnerable populations may not have access to high quality universal health care. The degree to which the health and wellbeing of individuals, communities, or populations groups living under such conditions who will be negatively impacted increases significantly in climate-related events, such as hurricanes and wildfires. This is primarily related to a lack of vital resources and infrastructure which inhibits or lessens adaptive capacity. For this reason, those living in poor countries or poorer regions within countries are most susceptible to health impacts related to climate change (IPCC, 2014b). There are populations living in resource-rich countries who are also vulnerable, particularly those with chronic, co-morbid illnesses. The extent to which an individual or population is vulnerable may vary from one setting to another (IPCC, 2014b). Several populations of concern who demonstrate greater vulnerability to health impacts of climate change have been identified. These include certain communities of color, immigrants, and individuals with limited English proficiency; indigenous populations; children and women, particularly pregnant women; older adults; persons with disabilities; and persons with chronic medical conditions (USGCRP, 2016).

Figure 1 – Impact of Climate Change on Human Health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016

# Climate Justice and Climate Stewardship as a Basis for Addressing Climate Policy and Advocacy Efforts

In an editorial on climate change entitled The Great Procrastination, leaders in public health noted that vulnerable populations living in areas with complex security issues, poverty, diminished access to human rights, and geographic disadvantage—for example areas of salt water intrusion, lack of ready access to water, and areas prone to heat stress—are particularly at risk for climate-related health consequences; further they suggest that human dignity, health consequences, and fragile health systems will lead to dire consequences for these disenfranchised populations (Lemery, Williams, & Farmer, 2014).

# Climate Justice and Climate Stewardship

Climate justice is an emerging concept related to the inequity and negative social and health consequences of those vulnerable populations as outlined above who contribute the least to GGEs, yet subsequently are most affected by the deleterious consequences of climate change (Nicholas & Breakey, 2017). Among the first government leaders to note the importance of climate justice was former President of Ireland Mary Robinson who established the Mary Robinson Foundation—Climate Justice (MRFCJ) to address the burdens faced by those most negatively affected by climate change, including future generations. This foundation is built upon principles that aim to address climate injustice including: respect and protect human rights; support the right to development; share benefits and burdens equitably; ensure that decisions on climate change are participatory, transparent, and accountable; highlight gender equality and equity; harness the transformative power of education for climate stewardship; and use effective partnerships to secure climate justice (MRFCJ, nd). Robinson developed the foundation in 2010 with a vision to be achieved by 2020 aimed at achieving a people-centered approach to advancing climate justice and more effectively addressing the impacts of climate change.

Levy and Patz (2015) view climate change through a human rights and social justice framework and describe the climate crisis as the “defining moral issue of the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century” (p. 311). Further, they note that the environmental and health consequences of climate change “threaten civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, including rights to life, access to safe food and water, health, security, shelter and culture” (p. 310). In addition, they underscore the concern noted by others that those who are most vulnerable including poor people, minority groups, women, children, the elderly, those with chronic diseases and disabilities are disproportionately affected, as are those residing in areas with high rates of climate-related diseases, and workers exposed to extreme heat and ambient weather variability such as migrant farm workers. Climate change and collective violence are significant public health concerns and contribute to complex patterns of population migration (Burrows & Kinney, 2016; Levy, Sidel, & Patz, 2017; Nicholas & Breakey, 2019). It is nearly universally accepted that those living in lowincome countries that contribute least to greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) are being adversely affected at higher rates with significant negative health sequelae associated with climate change (Nicholas & Breakey, 2017; Lemery, Williams, & Farmer, 2014). Those living in these areas are also limited in their capacity to mitigate, adapt to, and be resilient amidst climate change (Boeckmann & Zeeb, 2016). Three concepts are associated with climate change: mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. Mitigation efforts aim to reduce future climate change. Adaptation encompasses efforts to reduce the vulnerability of society to climate change impacts. Resilience efforts are aimed at safeguarding economic and social systems to be prepared for climate change (Boekmann & Zeeb, 2016; Leffers, McDermott-Levy, Nicholas, & Sweeney, 2017).

The importance of climate stewardship is being dis cussed more frequently in the media, as well as profes sional and lay literature as the challenges to sustain human health and the health of our natural systems have become more apparent (Nicholas & Breakey, 2017). Stewardship involves addressing the stressors associated with climate change to develop strategies aimed at mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts for individuals, communities, populations, and globally. Within the US, climate stewardship has roots in the introduction of legislation in 2003 known as the Climate Stewardship Act (S.139), which was introduced by then United States Senators Joseph Lieberman (Democrat/Independent, Connecticut) and John McCain (Republican, Arizona). This legislation established a mandatory cap on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride by electric generators, major industrial and commercial entities, and refiners of transportation fuels (https:// www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/139). Climate stewardship has subsequently been adopted as a key concept in addressing the effects of GGEs on the environment and the health sequelae associated with climate change.

Most recently in 2019, a bipartisan coalition of eight United States Senators formed the Senate Climate Solutions Caucus that includes Senators Mitt Romney (Republican, Utah), Mike Braun (Republican, Indiana), Lindsey Graham (Republican, South Carolina), Lisa

Murkowski (Republican, Alaska), Jeanne Shaheen (Democrat, New Hampshire) Chris Coons (Democrat, Delaware), Michael Bennet (Democrat, Colorado), and Angus King (Independent, Maine) in an effort to lead the US Congress on climate change efforts. From a political perspective, this represents a critical effort in leading on climate and health.

It is important to note that several prominent nursing organizations focus on policy development specific to climate stewardship and advocacy. The American Academy of Nursing Policy Priorities 2019-2020 address advancing health equity and championing wellness; promoting innovation and sustainability; and reducing patient, provider, and system burden. In the priority aimed at advancing health equity and championing wellness, one key public health focus area is climate change. The Canadian Nurses Association (CNA, 2017) disseminated a position paper highlighting the severe consequences to individuals, families and communities from climate change; the paper called for nurses to support adaptation and mitigation with respect to climate change through nursing practice, research, administration, education and policy. The Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments as a nursing organization and the National Nursing Collaborative on Climate Change, which engages leadership from key nursing organizations for a climate and health agenda are examples of leadership that has galvanized climate action among nurses. Other nursing organizations, including the National League for Nursing (NLN) with their Public Policy Agenda 2019-2020 (NLN, 2019), the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2019) Federal Policy Agenda for Academic Nursing 2019-20, and the American Nurses Association (ANA) Policy and Advocacy statements (ANA, nd), have not specifically focused on climate change policy and advocacy, but have adopted critically important policy statements. Their efforts lead in the areas of promotion of environmental health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities and support for research that investigates methods to improve the health of the public. For the purposes of this policy paper, we utilized and applied a framework for advocacy and policy efforts for application to the nursing profession’s efforts. First developed in the 1990s, this framework has a unique application in $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century nursing efforts related to health in our climate changing world. Although policy frameworks exist in other disciplines, the framework in this paper has important relevance for application related to nursing’s role in climate change policy and advocacy.

# Application of Nursing’s Stages of Political Development

A framework of Nursing’s Stages of Political Development (Cohen, Mason, Kovner, Leavitt, Pulcini, & Sochalski, 1996) offers an overview of nursing’s involvement in political activism and policy development that is relevant for considering nursing’s role regarding climate impacts on health, as well as climate policy and advocacy. As noted by Cohen et al., “the stages of nursing’s political activism are not time bound; nursing has straddled more than one stage of political development at a time” (p. 259) (Table 2). It is important to note that political activism by nurses is never time bound as we witness the relevance of Nightingale’s principles of clean air, water, and light related to climate change in the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century. Nursing’s progress in addressing policy and advocacy related to climate change impacts on health can promote political awareness of nurses and advance nursing’s role in climate-related health advocacy. Other recent analyses of nurses’ policy influence through a concept analysis exist (Arabi, Rafil, Ali Cheraghi, & Ghiyasvandian, 2014), however lack the specificity, depth, and breadth of policy development advanced in the framework of Cohen et al.

The stages of political development include buy-in as Stage 1 in development of policy and advocacy efforts. Buy-in represents nursing’s recognition of the importance of political activism. In the domain of climate and health, buy-in requires an understanding of the key relationship of climate change and its associated deleterious health consequences. Recent literature in important nursing journals has prominently featured papers on climate change and health to move the nursing profession forward on the stage of policy and advocacy related to climate change.

The second stage is self-interest whereby nurses react to the issues of interest (in this case climate and health) that nurses clearly view as affecting the health of their patients, families, and communities. Nurses form coalitions among nursing organizations to urge that professional associations have key nurses appointed to positions to offer impact for climate change action. This stage is particularly relevant for nurses and coalition building, and nurses as policy shapers including professional organizations are rallied for a health issues—just as climate change and health have increasingly become a lightning rod. As noted by Cohen et al. (1996), “the profession moves beyond the heightened awareness that characterizes stage one to political activism, wherein nursing begins to develop its own uniqueness” (p. 261) The American Academy of Nursing/Alliance of Nurses for Health Environments (ANHE)/Nursing Collaborative for Climate Change meets the goal of this stage as well as stage three— moving towards political sophistication. The Nursing Collaborative on Climate Change (NCCC) endorses the importance of political activism and engaging in health policy efforts to advance efforts for climate and health. Ten nursing organizations and our academic institution are among the constituents of the NCCC which include the American Academy of Nursing as a member. In our academic institution—a member of the

NCCC, we launched the first nurse-led Center for Climate Change, Climate Justice, and Health with a vision, mission, and core values (Nicholas, Breakey, Tagliareni, Tuck, Neal-Boylan, Ladd, Corless, Reynolds, Simmonds, & Lussier-Duynstee, 2019).

The third stage focuses on political sophistication—a key area whereby the nursing profession must position itself as the most trusted profession with a leading role in addressing climate and health issues and climate policy and advocacy. Nurses and professional nursing organizations must embrace climate and health as a critical issue and the public health challenge of the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century. Political sophistication has emerged as an area for development for addressing the health consequences of climate change. Examples of these efforts include the Nurses Climate Challenge which is a national movement to mobilize nurses to educate 50,000 health professionals about the deleterious health impacts of climate change. This effort is led by the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments and Health Care Without Harm. The aim of Health Care Without Harm is to lead the global movement for environmentally responsible health care and a commitment to engaging in climate and health. It is clear that the nursing profession has grown significantly in the area of political sophistication; however it is essential that nurses across all levels of academic preparation and practice settings become educated to address health consequences of climate change and lead the way for our patients, families, communities and populations.

The fourth stage is leading the way whereby the nursing profession is proactive in leadership and agenda setting for a broad range of climate and health, policy, and advocacy issues This stage focuses on initating coalition building beyond nursing for broad climate and health policy concerns and advancing partnerships with health professionals (physicians, nursing, physician assistants, public health professionals, occupational therapist, physical therapists, and others. Leading the way is also evidenced by the 2020 meeting of the Council for the Advancement of Nursing Science which will host their annual meeting with the theme of The Environment’s Impact On Health. Nurses are increasingly leading the way on climate change and health, however there are opportunities to further engage in these efforts.

# The Role of the Nursing Profession in Engaging in Policy and Advocacy Efforts Related to Climate Change

Watts and colleagues (2017) argue that the health professions have a responsibility to communicate to both policy makers and the public the specific threats that climate change has for human health and well-being. The public recognizes nurses as trusted experts who are committed to evidence-based practice and advocating for change. As a profession, nursing is poised to successfully respond to the health impacts of climate change because of their acquired expertise in policy and advocacy and health promotion and behavior change and their scientific knowledge base (Canadian Nurses Association [CNA], 2017, 2008). And as the most trusted profession identified by the Gallup Poll (Gallup, 2020), nursing in the US has recognition by patients, families, and communities that can be translated into climate action for those we serve. Although there may be differences in public trust in other countries, the nursing profession is viewed globally as having a significant commitment to optimal health outcomes for patients, families, communities, and populations. To that end, nurses can be influential in several areas including direct care, policy and advocacy, education and research and scholarship. Moreover, because of their specific focus on population health and the impact of social determinants on health, community and public health nurses have the expertise to intervene in climate-related disaster response and to address direct and indirect climate-related health impacts. As such, they are positioned—and perhaps obligated— to proactively support climate change adaptation, mitigation, and resilience. In fact, Goodman (2013) argues that failure of the profession to address the threats of climate change could be viewed as a failure of moral responsibility.

# Policy and Advocacy

As Watts and colleagues (2017) urged, there are unprecedented opportunities for public health providers to respond to the negative health impacts of climate change. Integrating a public health framework (CDC, 2014) into nursing advocacy and policy as well as nursing education at all levels can be useful to enhance nurses’ knowledge and guide the development of strategies to address climate change and its associated health impacts. This framework consists of three core functions: assessment, policy development, and assurance. Assessment provides the basis for identifying priority health impacts of climate change and developing tailored approaches to meet the needs of the community or population affected with a significant focus on public education. Second, the role of nursing in transdisciplinary policy development related to climate change is essential. Because nurses are uniquely suited to assess the impact of climate change on the health and well-being of individuals and communities, particularly those most vulnerable, they must utilize their leadership and advocacy skills to lend this expertise to policy making decisions and action plans focused on mitigation, adaption, and resilience. Lastly, the nurse’s role in policy making is also integral for the third core function focused on assuring a sustainable infrastructure that includes a knowledgeable workforce focused on climate change preparedness and that also ensures health care access for the most vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change.

# Nursing Education

The APHA recommends utilizing a disease prevention model that includes primary, secondary and tertiary prevention strategies (Polivka, Chaudry, & MacCrawford, 2012). Since APHA advocates for a disease prevention model, nursing’s stages of political development should engage with other professional organizations such as APHA to offer education about climate change and associated acute and chronic illnesses. Education is a key component of the model and provides the foundation for effective execution of the three public health core functions and prevention strategies and is the driving force to initiate action around climate change. Expanding nursing education related to climate change and planetary health is necessary to prepare nurses to fulfill their responsibility to support actions targeting climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience to protect human health and natural resources (Anaker, Nilsson, Holmner & Elf, 2015). Further, this expansion is necessary to ensure optimal public education related to climate change and its effect on health and well-being. Areas for further understanding include the science of climate change and the immediate and long-term implications that negative environmental impacts have on human health and flourishing, including mental health; the role of social determinants of health and health inequities; the emergence and expansion of infectious diseases, the increase in acute climate-related conditions, and the exacerbation of chronic illnesses; and the intersection between climate change and conflict and migration (CNA, 2017; Whitmee et al., 2015; Watts et al., 2017). Additionally, nursing actions to address the negative health consequences of climate change rely on a deep understanding of how socioeconomic, political, and cultural contexts influence a community’s or population’s ability to respond to climate events (Boeckmann & Zeeb, 2016; Goodman, 2013).

# Conclusion

The critical role of the nursing profession in addressing climate change and associated negative health sequelae is a key role for health policy and advocacy in the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century. Anthropogenic climate change is widely viewed by scientists, governments, policy experts, and health authorities globally as having dire effects on current and future health and well-being. A broad call for action for policy and advocacy efforts regarding climate change and health are critical for the nursing profession to address. Preparing nurses for clinical practice, education, research and scholarship in our climate-changing world, are key areas for policy and advocacy. Application of nursing’s stages of political development in climate change efforts has potential to impact the health of patients, families, communities, and populations through buy-in to prioritize climate and health advocacy, self-interest exemplified by nursing’s engagement in climate change efforts to address population health, political sophistication evidenced by nursing organizational efforts, and leading the way through proactive engagement in climate and health education, policy, and advocacy.
