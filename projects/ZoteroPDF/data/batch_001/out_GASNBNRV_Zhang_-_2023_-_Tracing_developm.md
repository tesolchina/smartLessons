Writing development

Knowledge construction at graduate level discursively engages writers in building the connection between disciplinary literature and their authority of individual creation. Existing research often sees this construction as social and dialogic and has widely examined its rhetorical and interactional features within its disciplinary local contexts. However, little attention seems to be drawn to the interplay between the expected presentation of knowledge and students' actual knowledgemaking. Through detailed discourse and intertextual analyses, this study explores supervisory orientations offered through written feedback and their impact on two L2 students' restructuring of knowledge in their master's theses. Findings reveal these students' incorporation of justifiable, interpretive and intertextually pertinent knowledge as concrete responses to these orientations. The ways they organized their conceptual and intertextual resources were shaped by explicit supervisory scaffold and how they wished to present a refined self (critical, self-reflexive, credible, socially-grounded) in writing.

# 1. Introduction

Knowledge construction is a social and rhetorical endeavour of conveying consensual knowledge and of demonstrating the rele. vance and newnes of one's own work within a community-generated literature (Hyland, 199; Kaufer & Geisler, 1989). In the process of synthesizing various resources (i.., social, cultural, conceptual, linguistic), writers locate themselves intertxtually and commu. nicate the meanings and implications of their research in insightfully new ways. This is a dialogic process in which writers learn to convey their understandings of the central values, norms and ideologies of the discourse community (Prior, 1998). More importantly, they learn to transform their academic knowledge into a social accomplishment' or 'a local contribution' (Hyland, 1999) which re. veals the outcome of interacting with a particular community group or orientation (Zhang & Hyland, 2021).

Previous research has widely discussed academic writers knowledge-making practices (e.g. Tardy, 2005; Bastalich, 2017; Hu, 2018; Sheldon, 2019) and identified different systems or domains of knowledge, such as language, genre, audience and topic schemas (Weigle, 2005), as what these writers should be iteratively oriented towards. Such observation acknowledges that knowledge is produced discursivel,often in a local, socio-cultural context. Yet, it sms unclear how knowledge-making practices are reulated by the normalizing force, in Starke-Meyerring and Pare's (2011) words, afforded or constrained by a collective's iscourse regulations" (p. 14). Moreover, despite considerable atention drawn to advanced academic writers scholarly contribution in the process of producing legitimate texs, relatively lttlei known about the knowledge-making endeavours of master's thesis writers who accept the challenge to be new, but are often seen as "only channelling the voices of actual members' (Pare et al., 2011, p. 219)

For this group of writers, perhaps, the most daunting task is to reconstruct social realities and relationships to represent their novel understandings obtained through conducting an independent research project. A growing need to articulate their new knowledge n their written work, then, points to a few questions: What is the knowledge constructed, refined or transformed in writing? How do ongoing interactions with advisors mediate these students' knowledge representations and lead to new ways of knowing or understanding?

Guided by these questions, this study explores the ways two L2 master's students, Tom and Ed, engaged with supervisory feedback to discursively present their knowledge in master's theses in a taught master's program. To understand their intensive interactions with their supervisors created mostly through fedback discussons surrounding their master's theses, I traced their supervisors feedback orientations and how these orientations subsequently shaped the two writers' knowledge-making practices, including the ways they incorporated different perspectives and resources into their master's thesis draft to adapt or reproduce knowledge.

From a socio-historic perspective, I seek to identify traces of the two writers' textual development in a Literature Review (LR) Chapter, and to reveal the impact of the micro-processes of supervisory advice-giving on their ongoing knowledge construction. Specificall, I examine two questions: (1) What kinds of rientations were ffered through upervisory written feedback to upport the development of master's theses? (2) How do students respond to these orientations to present their specific knowledge claims?

# 2. Knowledge construction in writing

Knowledge construction essentially involves reciprocal sense-making which is oten achieved through the exchange of individual meanings. When built in academic contexts, such knowledge, as Hyland (199) defines, i a social accomplishment, the outcome of a cultural activity" represented by \*grement between a writer and a potentially skeptical discourse community (p. 341). Itcan also be seen as the reitrative power of discipline discourse" utilized to lustrate the phenomenon that i names and regulates' (Bastalich, 2017, p. 7). Given that what counts as knowledge may vary, yet to a large extent determined and restricted by academic disciplines, writers are obliged to make their knowledge claims accountable to their disciplinary communities. They therefore need to create novel and coherent explanations to justify their knowledge claims whil conforming to epistemological and social conventions of their disciplines (Abdollahzadeh, 2011; Hyland, 199). This is what Hu (2018) views as the legitimation of knowledge in situated disci. plinary contexts.

In other words, writers knowledge-making practices are rather diverse and locally shaped (Pare et al., 2011) as they employ varied approaches to interpret and use existing knowledge structures. In Cress and Kimmerle's (2018) view, this is an emergent process that requires writer to integrate their own knowledge, opinions, and persectives while taking those of others into account. Seeing this as not merely internal mental representation but crucial interpersonal activity, they highlight the collaborative nature of knowledge building and the fact that knowledge isproduced \*in shared activities and is influenced by the context and the culture of learning (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018, p. 139).

That means writers can create an inter-individual process (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018) by referring to each other and incorporating each other's arguments to (re)organize existing knowledge structures, such as lines of argument, theories and hypotheses (Kaufer & Geisler, 1989). This is a discursive processof utilizing resources of a local community (e., a supervision/research team, a writing group), including those of scaffolding, regulation, prior knowledge and personal expertise, and of making case-specific adaptions to produce field-specific reasoning (Geisler, 1994). The outcome of such interaction reveals the writers' mediated achievement while, at the same time, extending writers cognitive systems (Chan & van Aalst, 2018) to promote their iterative development of writing.

The fact that knowledge construction is rhetorically complex requires these writers to mediate between the cases in which knowledge claims are created and the cases in which such claims are made meaningful (Geisler, 1994). To build a coherent writen self they then need to combine their domain-content knowledge with thir rhetorical knowledge to present their claims. Nonetheless facing a range of open-ended parameters (Kaufer & Geisler, 1989), such as unbounded sources and anonymous readership, novice writers truggle to llustrate the field's accepted knowledge, adopting the academic prose rooted in the existing scholarship.

To articulate writers authorial novelty, McNabb (2001) suggests developing gestures to rhetorical mode' and gestures to problem presentation in writing. Whil the former is concerned with speaking with a right tone and situating one's arguments in an authorized research tradition, the later focuses more on epistemological presentations which help foreground writers negotiations within their discourse communities (McNabb, 2001). Equally important is to allow one form of construction to guide that of the other. As Tardy (2005) reported in her case study, the evolving rhetorical knowledge of the masters student Chatri could promote a more explicit articulation of his research contribution (problem presentation'); and his epistemic presentation, in the form of a new structure adopted in the text also helped to reframe his thoughts and convey his emergent rhetorical expertise (hetorical mode). Thus, what is crucial to the acceptance of emergent knowledge claims is the (writer's) ways to mingle sources of content and rhetorical choices, making such manifestation \*recognisable as legitimate, warrantable, and powerful' in writing (Bazerman, 2002, p. 25).

# 3. Orienting towards knowledge and writing development

A sophisticated understanding of how to create, transform and adapt academic knowledge is esential to, and often embedded in, the process of developing academic texts. According to Bazerman (2001), this development is social and multidimensional, shaped by interpersonal relations and the isues of "identity, affect, elation, and one's place in the world (p. 298). Such development is also shaped by, and revealed in, how writers depict the centrality of new knowledge in their written work (tarke-Meyerring & Pare, 2011). This presentation, in Kaufer and Geisler's (1989) view, requires writers to learn the practice of an insider's rhetoric which is \*a set of tacit beliefs that acrue to one who actively trie (and mostly fail) in the role of knowledge-maker, in the role of author (p. 306). An insider's citation acts, for example, can be driven by the writer's self-interested purposes, such as highlighting a conceptual focus, building a contrast, and showing agrement or positional divergence. Such practice, however, can be learned only in the effort to be new and in the feedback one receives for one's effort' (Kaufer & Geisler, 1989, p. 306).

Research writers are often scafolded to make sense of the tactics of knowledge construction through a set of orientations that have different pedagogical or interactional purposes. For Locher and Limberg (2012), orientations are interactional achievements obtained through personal involvement, such as an expert's intervention and sharing of his/her own experiences. They are a practical means of communicating advisors' academic knowledge and their understandings of learners. In the context of academic supervision, orien. tations seem to be most frequently delivered through concrete advice to deal with a wide range of research and writing issues. Vehvilainen (2012), for example, presents the overall functions of fedback as problem negotiation and problem-solving, but more specifically identifies two broad orientations in master's thesis supervision - that is,criticism and corctive orientation on the one hand, and 'encouragement' on the other. Feedack herei regarded as a problem-solving strategy which allows an advisor to mobilize expert knowledge, but which is ffective only when it is connected to astudents perective or choice (Vevilainen, 2012). Lilli and Curry (2006a) see orientations as key types of revisions showing how research writers respond to discourse members textual interventions (i.e, feedback) in a research article. A range of orientations, as they summarized, include knowledge content', target journal conversations', disciplinary conversations' and 'specialist discourse'.

For Dysthe et al. (2006), feedack on written text is a central, multi-voiced activity of master's supervision upon which knowledge is co-constructe. By tagting rel readers, offering new idas and reinforcing multiple revisions at all levels and so on in a text, such feedback ultimately orients master's students to see what a master's thesis should be like, what language to use, and what textual norms to follow - all are parts of their knowledge of shared repertoires (Dysthe et al., 2006). Feedback can also function as an action (Vehvilainen, 2009) or orientation through teachers questioning and prompts, for example, to help develop a knowledge-building discourse' (Hmelo-Silver & Barrows, 2008). Knowledge construction is then a discursive process of managing the dissonances of different voices (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018) that possibly emerged from this orientation.

While the power of fedback on enhancing understandings of discourse and genre has been widely acknowledged (as discussed above), its ongoing impacts on shaping knowledge claims have reived relatively littl attention. In this study, I present knowledge construction a social perfomance and proces which reveals, and i reresented by, new ways of organizing meanings, ideas and other sociocultural resources. Drawing on Lilli and Curry's (2006) cateories, yet with a focus shifted towards the functions and impact of supervisory advice-giving, I observe how feedback orientations, as a crucial form of supervisors reulation, promote students ongoing development of master's theses, particularly their stuated knowledge-making practices. These orientations reveal the central, evaluative fouses f suervisors w omments, thediffent ast f tudents texl impoements thy ar retratively riented towards. Students' responses to these orientations are, accordingly, a display of their agentive decisions - what they choose to engage with and how they accommodate different ideas and knowledge resources to articulate their voices in the text (Castello & Inesta, 2012).

# 4. Participants and data

Data for this study were collected from two Chinese students, Tom and Ed, studying their master's degrees, Applied Linguisics by coursework at an English medium university in Hong Kong. The two writers speak English as their second language, and they studied Translation and Business respectively in their undergraduate studies. Both worked as English language teachers in private tutoring centres for some years, and had developed some practical understandings f teaching prior to their master's studies. Yet, both wrestled with how to incorporate ther social knowledge to expres their textual authority in academic writing. Whil appreciating the coursework feedback received in the master's program, they desired more dialogic opportunities and ongoing treatment of their written work in the process of learning.

To trace the possble influence of supervisory feedback on students' thesis development, I observed the two cases for one year during which they finished all coursework components and a thesis project. The two students were identified as my cases after my observation of their classoom performance for one semester which alowed me to build some rapport and develop close understanding of their research areas. This further facilitated my detailed analyses of the text-based supervisory interactions in a five-month supervision process.

The two students were supervised by their course teachers, Mandy (Tom's case) and Linda (Ed's case), who were experienced advisors supervising master's students for many years and having developed their expertise in the fields of discourse analysis and curriculum design. But they only started to develop intensive understandings of the two students' research projects after being allocated as their thesis supervisors. With expertise rooted in the two students reearch fields, the two supervisors offered extensive advice on a wide range f ssues (i. dentifying existing literare, shaping thortical positioning, collcting and procesing data) in supervision metings, emails and written texts (eg. 45 pages of feedack texts treating iues of LR draft 1. These iffrent forms of communication were closely analyzed to represent how they influenced \*complex, diverse and locall situated ways" of writers knowledge-making (Starke-Meyerring & Pare, 2011, p. 3).

In this paper, due to space constraint, I mainly present findings from observations of written texts by emphasizing two focuses (1) supervisory feedback orientations in Literature Revew (LR) drafts and (2) thestudents ways of displaying their adapted or reroduced knowledge in LR Chapter. More pecificall, I traced the two students' emergent ways of negotiating and (re)producing knowledge (i. e., epistemological, social, theoretical) through detailed discourse and intertxtual analyse f textual data (i.., writte feedback. chapter draft) which help identify the complexity and diversty of their knowledge-making endeavours (tarke-Meyerring & Pare. 2011). These analyses were further supported by in-depth qualitative interviews with the two writers exploring thir perceptions of teedback, supervision ssues and tneir own writing development. Several data sources were ncorporated to do so, as Tabie I snows. To obtain textually informed, locally situated understandings, my analyses examined \*broadly at contexts as well as closely at specificstuated activity" (Prior, 2004, p. 172). Specificall, supervisory fedback orientations were identified inductively and contextualized to show the kinds of interventions ofered in the LR chapter drafts, drawing on Lillis and Curr's (2006) categories. These orientations display supervisors' central, evaluative focuses (i.e., content, theory, genre, language) which could be partly revealed through certain linguistic hints, such as 'reader, positioning' and reearch gap', in their fdback texts. After initial cate gories were generated and discussed with membersof my research team, they were reiteratively applied to different data sets and re-defined to best capture the supervisors' key concerns which were subsequently verified with them through informal conversations.

To capture the developmental elements of supervisory advice, I also counted the number and frequency of feedback points building supervisory orientations in different R drafts. Noticeably, a feedback point typically reveals a particular aspec of the text yland & Hyland, 2012) or carrie n independent layer of meaning which can be embedded in part of or a complete, sentence. onsidering that supervisory practices are discursive and multi-dimensional (Starke-Meyerring & Pare, 2011), in Ed's case I also analyzed Linda's systematic editing acts which went beyond error correction to facilitate d's meaning-making. I view each diting act, which tackles a problem of atextual element, as asingle inervention, regardes of the length of the sentence being corrected. For example, crossing a word or a sentence is an editing act and dding a new phrase after crossing the wrong one is also seen as a ingleditig act. Such an added layer of analysis was driven by Ed's interpretation of supervisory editing as a vital strategy for his literacy development informing the expected forms of knowledge construction. Such intervention was also given in Tom's case, in a sparse manner, however.

To capture the evidence of the two students' writing development, I also examined the connections between supervisory feedback orientations and the two students' revised R draft, particularly their emergent or refined knowledge claims. This analysis i informed by the view of writing as intensive knowledge work (Pare et al., 2011) developed through ongoing feedback communication. Writing development is accordingly seen as a socially negotiated, multidimensional proces which could not be fully presented by an oversimplified approach that does not consider interpersonal dimensions and particularitie of individual cases (Bazerman et al., 2017).

The detailed illustrations of the two cases were also supported by discourse-based interviews with the two students and member. checking with them, and in Tom's case, by his learning notes as well. With a socio-historic interest in uncovering the accumulated influences of supervisory feedback, this intertextual tracing possibly reveals the sociohistoric impact of mediational means in master's thesis supervision. I shows how knowledge is ocall co-constructed and discursively mediated through connections between voices, ideas, interests, and influences carried into texs (Prior, 2004). These are the sociocultural resources these writers acumulated over time, which become a regulatory force shaping their situated knowledge-making practices.

# 5. Supervisory feedback orientations: an evolving focus

In both cases the supervisors ofered a range of feedback orientations to identify the two students potential knowledge gaps and scaffold thir representation of knowledge in their revised LR draft. Ipresent the concrete functions of these orientations in what follows.

# 5.1. Tom

The orientations offered by Mandy included knowledge content, reader awarenes, positioning of the stud, and issues of writing, which prompted Tom's reiterative engagement with disiplinary content. A distinctive feature of Mandy's guidance is her frequent treatment of knowledge content ( $5 0 \%$ and $9 0 . 9 \%$ Table 2 and Table 3). Specifically, she supports Tom's knowledge construction through her open-ended, knowledge-based questions (Hmelo-Silver & Barrows, 2008) which emphasize critical interpretations of subject matters (e.g., What important roledoes tis language play in jounalistic discourse? Why focus on this?, Fig. 1). While she also drew considerable attentioto ss f witinge. rammar, coheion, coherce, organization reresenting one thir of the totl feedback points inLR draft 1, she encouraged Tom to take more responsibility of his writing by alerting him to grammatical issues instead of providing extensive editing for him (e.g. 'Work on making your writing more concise', Fig. 1).

Compared to knowledge content, reader awareness was only commented on a few times in LR draft 1. Crucially, however, this orientation reveals the importance of developing an interactive writer-reader relationship addressed by Mandy many times. She, for example, explicitly suggests ways to prepare disciplinary audience for subsequent knowledge claims (refe the reader forward to this section by saying something .. ) and highlights the need to imagine an altenative view that readers might have (you have no idea who your secondmarker i going tobe, Fig.1. This orienttion addresss the ned o write fr local community that wll as his master's thesis, and it reveals knowledge as being constituted by \*agrement between a writer and a potentially skeptical discourse community' (Hyland, 1999, p. 341).

Positioning of the study was another perstent concern though it was only mentioned twice by Mandy in LR draft 1. Comments such as Here, link back to the reearch.. y how you are going  furthr hi work in the HK context alert om to the neessty of incrorating existing knowledge and developing intertextual positioning (hang & Hyland, 2022), that is, building his knowledge claims on relevant research and justifying his personal focus. This emphasis possibly leads him to gain some controlling authority (Kaufer & Geisler, 1989) over the articulation of the novelty of his position.

Fig. 1. Student text, supervisor comments and feedback orientations (Tom's case).

Mandy continues toassess Tom's use of academic terms and his interpretations of disciplinary problems in LR draft 2. Such focus is primarily achieved through the predominant knowledge content points provided $( 9 0 . 9 \%$ Table 3). Mandy, for example, frames her advice as a personal opinion (Hyland & Hyland, 2012) relevant to Tom's intended knowledge articulation (1 think you mean diferent cultures . What is a jounalist cultre?). Isues of witing and reader awarnes were nonethelessno longer her concern (see Table 3), perhaps because Tom had demonstrated concrete changes to respond to them. It seems that Mandy's commenting was shifting based on Tom's learning progressand the outcome of their feedback discussions. Her adjusted support revealed Tom's evolving knowledge display and what is necessry for turning a newcomer researcher into an insider (Kaufer & Geisler, 1989) knowing how to compose with greater criticality in writing.

# 5.2. Ed

In Ed's case, Linda offered a great deal of scaffolding through comments on knowledge content, knowledge about subgenre, reader awareness positioning of the study, and sses of writing (se Table 4). Among them, knowledge content is one of the most frequently commented aspects ( $2 6 . 6 \%$ in LR draft 1) addressing how to develop a sophisticated understanding of existing knowledge structures, such as frameworks, approaches and templates used in prior research. Linda, fr example, points out Ed's oversimplified approach to identifying the research gap (This sounds weak. These were the key variables of your study, Fig. 2), and sugests building intertxtual positioning to justify his approach.

Table 4 Feedback orientations in Ed's LR draft 1.   

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="7">Feedback orientations</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Knowledge about subgenres</td><td>Knowledge content</td><td>Reader awareness</td><td>Positioning of the study</td><td>Issues of writingd</td><td>Overall</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15 (12.1%)</td><td>33 (26.6%)</td><td>2 (1.7%)</td><td>7 (5.6%)</td><td>67 (54%)</td><td>124 (100%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Specifically, she highlights the importance of building textual positioning through searching a community consensus and carving out a space to situate his claims in LR drat 1 (you ned to point out the gaps . led to the importnce of the ollowing instrment tha ou used .. , Fig. 2). Here we can see Linda orients him to develop a bolder presentation of his knowledge contribution through explicit explanation of the practice of an insider's rhetoric (Kaufer & Geisler, 1989), a justifiable presentation of the use of instrument in his research.

In both drafts, Linda offered advice on knowledge about subgenres ( $1 2 . 1 \%$ and $3 3 . 3 \%$ , Tables 4 and 5), guiding Ed to think about the conventions to follow in a literature review (Liteatre Review is not to introduce ., Fig. 2. By doing so, she reiteratively reminds Ed that literature rview is a critical ealuation of previous studies which needs to be carefully crafed through outlining both common consensus and the writer's positioning within it.

It is worth noting that Linda most often commented on issues of writing (more than $5 0 \%$ in both drafts), and in addition to that, she provided comprehensive editing, mostly at lexico level (i.e, word choice, verb tense, verb form), to enhance the accuracy of Ed's meaning-making. Her editing acts, which lead to the rhetorical co-construction of knowledge, largely consist of three types: crrcting grammatical erors, enhancing clarity of writing, and modifying stylistic issues of writing (Table 6 and Table 7).

Among these types, grammatical corrections constitute $7 2 . 5 \%$ and $8 2 . 3 \%$ of the total in LR draft 1 and LR draft 2 respectively. The numbers of the three types of editing are, however, significantly reduced in LR draft 2 (Table 7) possibly due to Ed's increased awareness of the accurate use of standard language forms in LR draft 2.

The above analyses present Linda's explicit guidance offered through contextualized orientations and editing to reinforce Ed's ongoing conceptual mapping and knowledge-making. The fact that she ofered much les input in LR draft 2 revealed her supervision approach shifing from comprehensive treatment to 'selective yet purposive treatment'. Here we can se a more balanced focus of advice-giving developed by Linda, which was more on domain content (i.e, ideas, academic conventions) and les on language related issues. Such a supervision approach appears to be largely driven by Ed's acceptance of her content suggestions and nearl all her correctios. It helps to promote a more robust, rhetorically accurate epistemological presentation, and at the same time, reinforce reciprocal sense-making.

# 6. Knowledge construction as new ways of interpreting and organizing conceptual and intertextual resources

A broad analysis of feedback orientations, as discussed above, has shown us the general functions of supervisory feedback orientations. Inthis section I further contextualize the discussion of these orientations by focusing on the ways two students responded to them. Specificaly, I present these orientations as a mediating structure and an essential scafold which helped the two students to establish an identifiable area f literature analysis, a welldefined path they could safely follow to articulate their context-specific knowledge and conceptual understandings. Their revisions showed how they built or elaborated a context to demonstrate their justifiable, interpretive and intertextually pertinent knowledge in master's theses.

# 6.1. Presenting justifiable knowledge within an interpretive context

Tom's early revision is characterized by his oosted clams through the use of emphatics (very ofte... , clearly sugests .. ) and comparative form (a more inightul.. ) which to some extent demonstrates his authorial understandings (see Original statements, Fig. 3). But while he made explicit rference to Martin and White's (2005) work, with a direction quotation explaining what Judgement and Engagement mean within the framework of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) this citation does not create a plausible basis for his subsequent statement. It seems to mainly reveal the leitimacy of the knowledge source itself, instead of "drawing on it as supporting testimony" (Hyland, 1999 p. 354). Such presentation then may only help to establish a context for accommodating others' views, rather than showing the writer's use of intertextual warrants for knowledge making.

Mandy then urges Tom to reconsider his presentation of the isciplinary problem. She challenges him to think about how to develop arguments in a more collaborative manner, incorporating areader-oriented analys You are taking as if your reader knows .. ). Such an emphasis was frequently maintained through her use of interrogative form (I i true for Engagement ..?) and her personal view () can see any convincing argument ... ', Fig. 3).

Tom, in fact, recognized the oversimplified approach to using these terms in LR draft 1 and so presented i as one of his problems in his learning notes: No argument, just say I reconized .. (Fig. ). He highlighted Local Isue in bold type and then offered a solution to this, stating he would focus on Attitude, especially the role it plays, though he could not properly explain why he chose to downplay the other two terms.

But by considering Mandy'suggestion on restructuring knowledge content (This whole paragraph nees rformulation'), in LR draft 2 Tom rewrote this paragraph to underline three reasons for analyzing Attitude (see Revised statements, Fig. 3). He builds a new, interpretive context for demonstrating his analytical interpretations shifting from knowledge source (centering on others' views) to knowledge user (towards an analytical summary). So by changing his approach to organizing knowledge sources, Tom shows his epistemological presentation, explicitly marking his attitude (Atitde plays an importan role . ). He also attributes a stance to previous studies (This has een shown y.. ). Ths shows an increasd insider's awarenes of the use of cittion, though his decription is rather brief here.

In LR draft 2 he also presents a more concise llustration of the three key concepts (engagement', graduation' and attitude) without using quotes. The intertextual links between his cited works are, accordingly, e explicit. But the new approach he adopted to organize the literature seems to reflect a more analytical, reader-oriented analysis. His background knowledge is, in particular, reveald tho  tion f r ssile fig i s fel t., ues the rers r v enie , g. 3. Here, Tom is seeing to achieve intersubjectivity by incorporating Mandy's suggestion on reader awareness. His knowledge con. struction was therefore not merely an internal mental representation (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018), but a collaborative endeavor responding to Mandy's orientation.

Fig. 4. Tom's learning notes: problems and solutions.

While realizing the importance of building a shared theoretical basis Tom found it dfficult to understand the tast and preferences of his target readers. He described the challnge he faced when engaging with a wide range of unbounded sources and anonymous readership:

My supervisor suggests developing more reader awareness and I assume my readers are those who are interested in my work. But there are different groups of readers, multiple audiences, who can be interested in my research work. So, I don't know who my readers are exactly. It i also hard for me to predict what kinds of knowledge are shared by my readers and what they may view as 'new in my research. I am not sure if I could make a unique contribution to my academic field $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ interview).

Obviously, Tom struggled to make sense of the fll range and complexit of existing knowledge structures and the nature of his own knowledge-making. He was unconvinced of his own authority of individual creation' while accepting the authority of consensus (Kaufer & Geisler, 1989). As he further noted, Although I have new ideas and some interesting interpretations of SFL, I'm not creating a theory. I doubt how much I could add to this well-established field' (2nd interview). Here, we can see Tom seems to interpret knowledge contribution as what is redily, univerall accepted rather than the riteative power ilustrating the phenomenon under discussion (Bastalich, 2017).

Although doubting the newness of his research, Tom tried to speak with an authorial voice that conveyed his new knowledge - a fresh perspective of understanding SFL. An ilustrative example is his presentation of a reasoning processhowing his original understanding and some justfiable knowledge (i.., thepattens may not be that easy to know.., ig 3. While his knowledge clam is not effectively supported by citations, he builds a more careful balance betwen his intended justification and explicit interpretation. This reflect the increasingly legitimate aspect of his knowledge-making (Hu, 2018; Hyland, 1999) and his greater controlling authority (Kaufer & Gesler, 1989 over more critical and self-reflexive writer image. I is arefined self discursively shaped by what he observed as new and intertextually pertinent - relevant to both theories and readers - in writing.

# 6.2. Foregrounding problem presentation through a different intertextual link

Ed's early LR drafts were criticized by Linda as merely presenting past studies lacking a clear connection between topics/aspects reviewed and his own research focus. This problem was repeatedly addressed by Linda, both in early supervision meetings and her written comments. With a significant emphasis on what a critical review should be like, Linda, for example, suggests ways to depict research gaps and research questions in section 2.3 Summary. As she highlights, these gaps should be developed naturall.

Responding to this suggestion which requires the integrating of knowledge about subgenre with content and background knowledge, Ed adds a new paragraph, that is, setion2.3, inLR draft 2 (se Fig. 5. Ed begins with brief indication of the need to focus on tertiary. level teachig in the riat rin ceter (th the song deand d sup f it, while h rh covring ttiy lel s san.). He then presents three research questions exploring students' attitude and perceptions, before moving on to elaborate a context in which these questions are furthr explained . m y to evaluate...) and more explicly actd wth onef his rearch aims

Added statements in section 2.3, LR draft 2 (the underlined parts were Linda's correction)

After the review of literature pertinent to private tutoring, with the strong demand and supply of it ...we can notice that the research of private tutoring has mainly been focusing on primary and secondary students (Bray, 2012; W. Zhang, 2014) while the research covering tertiary level is scant, this would be the niche of this paper...For this end, three research questions were raised:   
1.What is students' attitude toward the curricula of the CET, GSEEE courses offered by the private tutoring institution?   
2.What are students' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the curricula of the evaluated courses?   
3.What are the similar strengths or weaknesses of the curricula of the evaluated courses from students' perceptions?

These questions mainly try to evaluate the curricula of these courses and identify the collective advantages and disadvantages in them through the lens of students. Thus deeper understanding of the success of shadow education in China is hereby investigated. However, in order to answers these questions, several variables need to be discussed with regard to the related literature in the following sections. First of all the definition of curriculum and curriculum evaluation should be settled; then different methods of curriculum evaluation should be discussed and different student evaluation surveys will be compared and contrasted...

# e associated supervisory comments in LR draft 1 (which promoted above chang

The chapter mainly presents some studies in these aspects, but not discusses them to bring out the research gaps. (Knowledge content)   
Research questions should be developed naturally from reviewing literature (Subgenre knowledge)

Fig. 5. Student text and associated supervisory comments (Ed's case).

(Thus deeper understanding of .. is hereby investigated').

Ed goes on to introduce several aspects of his review, including several variables', definition of curriculum', 'methods of cur. riculum evaluation' and student evaluation surveys, which respond to Linda's orientations towards both knowledge content and subgenre. But instead of building on a shared knowledge basis, here Ed mainly incorporates what Linda believes as important as an intertextual link to build common ground with readers. This revision apparently presented his collaborative knowledge building deriving from close alignment with the supervisor's positioning. Feedback then appears to be a strategy for accurate identification of disciplinary problems worthy of discussion.

Though realizing the need to incorporate context-specific knowledge to present more finely crafed arguments, Ed lacked a specific know-how to use relevant academic terms to preent his theoretical understandings. Linda's input, which offered him a set f rhetorical choices, then became a crucial mediating resource scaffolding his knowledge display. For Ed, the correction offered to his research question in LR draft (offred by th priate tutoring insttion, Fig.5), for example, was an essential linguistic medium clrifying his meaning-making. As he said,

I developed some practical understandings of teaching, particularly the use of course materials in private tutoring centers. But presenting them under a conceptual or theoretical framework is really difficult. Often, I don't know what term or word to use. For example, I used the positive and negative sides of currculum' and my supervisor replaced sides' with 'aspects' She also added for student evaluation' to the subtitle The module approach and the computer-based cafeteria system' She made lots of corrections which prompted me to think about the acuracy and scope of my analysis and how to reorganize my thinking based on what I've learnt in my past experiences. $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ interview)

Ed sought to interweave his insights gained through his prior social encounters and to present such understanding as what was mainly informed by students perspectives, instead of teachers So his new knowledge was likely to be, at least partly, presented by this novel perspective and through his atempts t transform his social understandings of a prior teaching context into a local contribution.

Responding to Linda's reiterative orientation towards both content and rhetorical domains of knowledge-making, in LR draft 2, Ed formed a more concrete intertextual link betwen supervisory emphasis, the occupied tertory i.e, the existing approach) and his interested issues (e.g., student evaluation, shadow education). He, for example, explicitly marks the potential contribution of his research by saingThus deer underanding of the suces . isherey ivestigated (Fig. 5). As he pointed out,  blieve my reearch can make some contribution, but how to say it requires a lot of technique' (2nd interview).

Here we can se Ed realized not only the sort of knowledge to transmit, but also the need to craft itinto something \*recognisable as legitimate, warrantable, and powerful\* (Bazerman, 2002, p. 25). In Tardy's (2005) sense, he began to see \*content, genre forms, and even the research proces" (p. 336) as rhetorical. For Ed, responding to supervisory feedback was a discursive proces of incorporating others (mostly supervisory) opinions and sugestions into his own line of reasoning, and of externalizing and reproducing his previously acquired social knowledge in writing. Though he did not present the isonances of different voice, including the supervisor's and other researchers', he was trying to carve out a space for his cognitive authority at a local sense.

Ed's increased rhetorical understanding was thus tightly bound to his awareness of restructuring his domains of knowledge (conceptual, contextual, genre, linguisic). The ways he organized them - privileging one domain over the other - were mediated by how he wished to preent arefine sef that is knowledgable, analytically osant, and socill gounded. It apars to be the textual persona he sought to present by meeting the requirements of LR and supervisory orientations. Ed's knowledge construction was thus a highly collaborative endeavor displaying personal allegiance to supervisory feedback and his own social resources (a practitioner's prior knowledge, social position and commitment) which were subsequentl transformed into a local accomplishment conveying new insights in his master's thesis.

# 7. Conclusion and final thoughts

In this paper, I present knowledge construction as new ways of interpreting and organizing writers' conceptual and intertextual resources,a socill negotiated proces that directs writers to more tightly connect their local contributions with broader pattens of disciplinary inqury. Such construction is also a shared activity discursively shaped by orientations of supervisory feedback such as knowledge content, knowledge about subgenre and readership awareness as observed in the two cases. Among them, knowledge content seems to most profoundly influence the two writers knowledge-making practices. Pared with other emphases, such as positioning of the study and issues of writing, this guidance points out the gap between the (supervisors') expected use of writer knowledge (., academic terms, theories, conventions of writing) and the writers' current writing practices. This also appears to be the gap between what is seen as shared repertoires (i.e., norms, rules) and writers' own sense of and approaches to disciplinary problems.

For both writers, supervisory orientations were a crucial mediational means shaping their source-using and collaborative knowledge-making. They lead them to think about ways to utilize the knowledge-related perspectives and resources of collaboration (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018) offered by supervisory feedback. Responding to supervisory orientations, both writers elaborated a context for showing their justifible, interpretive, and intertextudly pertinent knowledge, and began to treat knowledge construction as a discursive inter-individual process (Cress & Kimmerle, 2018). Importantl, they recreated the knowledge context in which they could articulate their social beliefs and alignment.

Like Tardy (2005) and Li (2006), I find writers' knowledge was reproduced through applying and justifying a new approach to organizing their conceptual and intertextual understandings. The two writers, however, resituated their arguments within an authorized tradition of inquiry in diffrent ways. Tom prioritized an analytical presentation of why he chose to examine Attitude', presenting his focus as justifible and deriving from a cautious assment of relevant source materials (e.g., theories, frameworks, advice). For Ed, Linda's explicit advice sems to be a vital intertextual tool he incorporated to process his social understanding and represent sources of knowledge (e.g., assumptions, aproaches, templates). Apart from that, Linda's editing, which manifested her intervention in the rhetorical space, facilitated Ed's externalization of his socially acquired knowledge and eventually helped co-construct a more sophisticated artefact.

Supervisory feedback orientations thus led the two writers towards \*more established ways of making knowledge for solving disciplinary problems" (McNabb, 2001, p. 20). These solutions were generated through a fundamental rethinking of the writers' own positionings in relation to disciplinary content and to their prior learning and social resources (Zhang & Hyland, 2022). As the two writers combined their social and theoretical understandings in new ways, they were learning to see knowledge-making as a local. collective product (Starke-Meyerring & Pare, 2011; Chan & van Aalst 2018) and as evolving rhetorical performance mediated by the situated negotiations in which it i produced. Such learning further led them to a more cautious representation of the textual self, a more critical, self-reflexive, analytically observant, and socially grounded writer image.

Despite such development observed, the two writers struggled to shift their authority away from the context of social activities to the academic discourse in which they sought to develop a professional voice. Their knowledge clams may only add to the existing knowledge by a smaller amount than what experts could (Li, 2006). But this cannot deny the role of them as potential knowledge-makers actively participating in textually-mediated interactions to make scholarly contributions.

With a narrow focus on two students, thistudy has revealed an incomplete picture of master's thesis writers' knowledge con struction which was primarily seen in their changing interpretations of and approaches to disciplinary litrature. Based on selected textual examples such description is inevitably limited. Neither could these findings clearly identify pattens of knowledge recreation that could be broadly applied to diffrent disciplinary contexts.Informed by the view of knowledge-making as context-specific and rhetoricall intensive endeavor (Starke-Meyerring & Pare, 2011), however, I ffered a detailed analys of the regulatory practices of local supervision contexts. I have presented knowledge construction as a collaborative, socio-rhetorical activity which is shaped by how writers utilize supervisory feedback and incorporate their socio-historical resources (prior knowledge, social position, beliefs, commitment) for individual creation.

This study has implications for how research writer could use supervisory feedback to make sense of the established community consensus and of the ways to connect it with their evolving conceptual authority. While acknowledging newcomer research writers dilemma when understanding normalized discourse practices, I show how these writers could modify elements of knowledge inter. pretation (i.., intrtextual aligment) to relocat thmeles and to llustrat the novelty of thir positions in aisciplinary literature. Future studies could draw more attention to how novice writers authorize their claims in different types of texts. Comparing this observation with the experts knowledge construction is also ikely to be profitable. These distinctions possbly reveal diffrent ways of constructing disciplinary expertise (Zhang & Hyland, 2021) which in turn mediate how disciplinary actors negotiate and refin knowledge in different research conversations. Afterall academic knowledge construction is a social accomplishment Hyland, 1999) which is as this study reveals, ightly bound up with and constantly shaped by writrs emergent conceptual authority resulting from their ongoing interaction and re-interpretation of available resources.
