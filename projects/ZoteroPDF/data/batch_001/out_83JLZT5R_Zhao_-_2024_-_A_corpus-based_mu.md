Multi-dimensional analysis

Aviation English (AE), a specialized register of English, prioritizes precision, brevity and clarity to maximize aviation safety. While there has been a growing focus within the linguistics community on AE training and assessment since the release of a set of standards and recommended practices, its linguistic properties remain comparatively underexplored. Drawing upon Biber’s (1988) multi-dimensional (MD) analysis framework, the present study conducted a corpus-based comparative MD analysis to investigate the multidimensional linguistic profile of AE vs. casual conversational English (CE) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to extract and interpret the co-occurring linguistic features of routine AE and non-routine AE. The comparative MD analysis shows that AE exhibits more information condensation, less authorial stance and technicality, and fewer features of online information elaboration compared to CE. The EFA shows variations in the linguistic and textual composition of the two sub-registers of AE across two dimensions. Nonroutine AE demonstrates a present-focused, viewpoint/intention-oriented approach, involving higher levels of integrative information flow compared to routine AE. Routine AE is characterized by a higher degree of information condensation and is marked by a planned, procedural, and intensive use of standard phraseology. Some pedagogical implications are then proposed for enhancing AE training to cultivate pilots’ and air traffic controllers’ language competence for precise, unambiguous communication tailored to both routine and non-routine operational contexts.

# 1. Introduction

Aviation language (commonly referred to as Aviation English in its global context) and aviation communication are important and fast developing objects of applied linguistics (Borowska, 2017, p. 45). Aviation English (or Aeronautical English, AE) refers to radiotelephony language that includes both Standard Phraseology (SP) and plain language (Borowska, 2017, p. 65). AE, a specialized variety of English used for communication between pilots and air traffic controllers (ATCOs), is a spoken variety of English, with no written version (Bieswanger, 2016, p. 72). As a distinct register of English, AE is defined by its codified, abbreviated, and jargon-filled nature (Trippe & Baese-Berk, 2019, p. 30). As aviation technology has continuously evolved, the rate of aircraft accidents directly caused by technical defects has decreased over time. In contrast, human factors during operational processes, especially those in language-related aspects, have progressively emerged as major contributory factors of aviation incidents and accidents.

As such, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) developed a set of standards and recommended practices concerning language use in AE communication. These ICAO guidelines permit the use of two different and precisely defined varieties of AE: Standard phraseology in most routine situations and plain language when standard phraseology is insufficient to serve an intended transmission (Bieswanger, 2016, p. 67). While SP is concerned with the fairly restricted aspects of routine air traffic control issues, plain language covers a broader range of topics in non-routine situations, such as emergencies as well as other unusual or unexpected contexts. The challenge of separating standard phraseology from plain AE lies in the fact that the two are intertwined in the real life context (Estival et al., 2016, p. 85).

As plain language is identified as the language used when standard phraseology is not available for a particular situation, the lack of clarity around plain language definitions may contribute to differences in training and to language variation (Drayton & Coxhead, 2022, p. 21). Some English-speaking countries’ training providers even consider plain language as natural English or casual conversational English (CE) and assume that CE plus aviation terminology indicates AE language proficiency. As a result, specialized AE training designed specifically for ab initio pilots often receives little or no attention.

# 2. Literature review

Due to the crucial role of AE in ensuring air safety, a considerable body of research has been dedicated to investigating AE and the impact of its voice and language on the safety or efficiency of air traffic control (ATC) (Barshi, 1997; Barshi & Farris, 2013; Lopez et al., 2013; Moder, 2013). These studies have focused on communication, particularly issues of miscommunication between pilots and ATCOs (Barshi, 1997; Barshi & Farris, 2013; Kent, 2003; Lopez et al., 2013; Moder, 2013; Moder & Halleck, 2009; Philps, 1991; Sänne, 1999). The publication of ICAO Doc. 9835 marked a significant milestone in the field of aviation language. This document offers extensive guidelines and recommendations for the effective implementation of language proficiency requirements (LPRS) among aviation personnel. Subsequently, there has been a surge in research focusing on the training and assessment of AE, aiming to enhance instructional practices and testing methodologies in this domain. In recent years, ontological studies on AE have gained momentum in exploring its phonology (Trippe & Baese-Berk, 2019), vocabulary (Drayton & Coxhead, 2023; Sumby, 1960), lexico-grammatical patterns (Borowska, 2017), pragmatics (Ishihara & Prado, 2021), and functional profile (Kukovec, 2008; Mell & Godmet, 1997; Moskalenko, 2020; Zhao, 2023). These studies have enriched our understanding of AE by providing a valuable descriptive analysis of individual linguistic features. However, no studies to date have focused on the co-occurrence patterns of linguistic features in AE and attempted to interpret the functional bases underlying AE, routine AE, and non-routine AE by quantitative methods.

As we delve deeper into the study of AE, it is important to introduce the concept of “register”, which is a variety associated with a particular situation of use, including particular communicative purposes (Biber, 2009). Biber’s multi-dimensional (MD) analysis is a methodology for analyzing and comparing registers based on the co-occurrence of 67 linguistic features across texts. The features capture aspects of grammar, lexis and discourse organization, and factor analysis is used to group features that tend to co-occur into interpretable dimensions of variation. The MD analytical approach is developed for the comprehensive analysis of register variation and systematic linguistic differences among registers (Biber, 2004).

Most MD studies have been undertaken to investigate the patterns of variation among “registers”: varieties of language that are defined by their situational (i.e. non-linguistic) characteristics (Biber, 1995). Conversation is an example of a register according to this definition, as are newspaper reportage, classroom lectures, personal letters, and academic research articles. The original MD studies (Biber, 1985, 1988) analyzed a wide range of general spoken and written registers in English, while many subsequent studies have applied those dimensions to the analysis of other more specialized registers (Conrad & Biber, 2001).

Studies of spoken discourse using MD analysis have revealed valuable insights into the systemic variation within and across different registers of conversation. Early studies analyzed general patterns of variation in conversational texts (Carter & McCarthy, 1997; McCarthy, 1998; Quaglio & Biber, 2006; Quaglio, 2009), while subsequent studies examined specific conversational registers like job interviews (White, 1994) and television talk shows/debates (Connor-Linton, 1989; Scott, 1998). More recently, researchers have conducted comparative MD analysis of more specific conversational varieties, such as between British and American spoken English (Helt, 2001), between movie conversation and face-to-face conversation (Forchini, 2011), and between conversational English and call centre (Friginal, 2008, 2009, 2013). Despite the wealth of research on conversational registers, there is a noticeable lack of exploration of AE as a specialized register in conversation.

Furthermore, Bieswanger (2016) defined the standard phraseology and the plain language as two distinct, specialized registers of AE (p. 71), and then conducted a qualitative analysis by utilizing Biber & Conrad’s (2009) framework which encompasses parameters, such as situational characteristics of registers (participants, relations among participants, channel, production circumstances, setting, communicative purposes and topic). Borowska (2017) described SP as a specific code that consists of a limited set of prescribed words and phrases, devoid of complex grammar structures, used for constructing meaningful direct utterances used solely for the purposes of routine aeronautical communication during aircraft operations in order to facilitate comprehension in high risk environments for the best linguistic performance. Plain language is a spontaneous, creative and non-coded use of a given natural language, and does not mean everyday English (p. 77). Friginal et al. (2021) qualitatively analyzed the vocabulary and functions of the two sub-registers and stated that SP designed for frequently occurring, routine communicative tasks, represents one end of a register continuum with conversational English on the opposite, unrestricted end. “Plain Aviation English”, then, is characterized by topic and situationally restricted vocabulary and more flexible grammatical structure and pronunciation necessary in non-routine contexts. Thus, the Plain Aviation English would fall somewhere between SP and conversational English, though it is situated closer to SP than to conversation (pp.4445). Pacheco (2022) discussed the use of reported speech in aeronautical communications by analyzing the occurrences of this structure in two specialized corpora, the Corpus of Pilot and ATC Communications (CORPAC) and the Radiotelephony and Plain English Corpus (RTPEC), examining reporting verbs used in actual conversation samples and structures after the verbs said and told. However, no further empirical exploratory factor analysis (EFA)/comparative MD analysis has been conducted between the two distinct, specialized sub-registers. Without quantitative analysis, a comprehensive account of the differences between them remains elusive. This presents a significant gap in our understanding of AE in routine and non-routine situations, as the distinction between plain language and standard phraseology is crucial in pilotATCO communication.

The current study attempts to fill these research gaps by conducting a comparative MD analysis between CE and AE, and an EFA/MD analysis of the two sub-registers of AE, focusing particularly on the differences between standard phraseology and plain language, between AE in routine and non-routine situations, extending it to the realm of AE and thus going beyond the current scope of MD studies.

In light of the research gaps discussed above, the research questions are raised as follows:

1. How do AE and CE vary in terms of their linguistic features?   
2. How are the linguistic features of AE in routine situations distinct from those in non-routine situations?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Corpus description

The CE is represented by the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (Du Bois et al., 2000) which is based on a large body of recordings of naturally occurring spoken interaction from all over the United States. The Santa Barbara Corpus consists of conversations that occurred among individuals from different regions, ages, occupations, genders, and ethnic and social backgrounds. The predominant form of language use represented is face-to-face conversation, but the corpus also documents many other ways in which people use language in their everyday lives: telephone conversations, card games, food preparation, on-the-job talk, classroom lectures, sermons, story-telling, town hall meetings, tour-guide spiels, etc. As indicated in Table 1, the corpus has a total of 243,300 tokens.

Table 1 Descriptive statistics of the ATC and SB corpora.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Corpus</td><td>Subcorpus</td><td>Text</td><td>Words</td><td>TTR</td></tr><tr><td>ATC</td><td> Non-routine AE</td><td> 50</td><td>31,603</td><td>185</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Routine AE</td><td> 50</td><td>58,746</td><td>274.5</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td></td><td>60</td><td>243,300</td><td>169.73</td></tr></table></body></html>

The ATC corpus used in this study was self-compiled, consisting of AE communications that occurred in routine and nonroutine situations. A total of 100 authentic radio transmissions were collected to ensure the representativeness and balance of the authentic AE usage. ATC corpus has routine AE and non-routine AE subcorpora with a combined total of 90,349 tokens. The descriptive statistics for the ATC corpus are shown in Table 1.

The routine AE records originated from Blanton’s (2023) Broadcastify.com, the world’s largest source of public safety, aircraft, rail, and marine radio live audio streams. We monitored the aviation radio feeds during peak and off-peak periods, recorded and downloaded 50 live records from both hub and regional airports, and ATS units including Ground (GND), Tower (TWR), Approach (APP), Departure (DEP), Center (CTR), as shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Description of routine AE in the ATC corpus.

Representativeness and balance were aimed in corpus construction. 50 recorded non-routine radio transmissions were collected from the Sanchez’s (2023) VASAviation channel on YouTube, which is well-known for posting ATC frequency conversations in emergency situations. All video files record AE communications that occur in non-routine situations, such as bird strikes, engine fire or failures, landing gear failure, smoke in equipment bay, lightning strike, and near mid-air collision.

# 3.2. Multi-dimensional analysis tagging

The two corpora were analyzed using Multi-dimensional Analysis Tagger (MAT) software developed by Nini (2015). This software applies a framework based on Biber’s (1988) study of register variation across speech and writing. The MAT first conducts a part-of-speech analysis of each text using the tagging approach of Toutanova et al. (2003). It then extracts the linguistic features identified in Biber (1988) from the tagged text. Feature frequencies are normalized per 100 words to account for length differences. By performing such normalization, the differences in the total word counts between texts can be eliminated, enabling the comparability of feature distributions across texts of different lengths. This allows for a more accurate analysis and comparison of feature usage in different texts, without being influenced by text length. Normalized frequencies are then used to calculate dimension scores for each text aligned with Biber’s (1988) dimensions. This process replicates the basic methodology of Biber’s (1988) MD analysis.

First, the MAT tagged texts were produced by the tagger. In order to ensure the accuracy of the tagging, a sample of approximately $5 \%$ of the tagged texts was manually checked. The main tagging problems were noted and subsequently fixed manually in both the sample and the remainder of the corpus. After that, the MAT tagged texts were further processed. The MAT tagger generated three output files containing the following information both for each input file and for the corpus as a whole: the normalized frequency per 100 tokens for each linguistic feature, the Z-score of each feature, and the score for each of Biber’s (1988) six dimensions. The program generated two sets of graphs that allow for the determination of the genres that the corpus is closest to on each dimension and the text type it is closest to overall, respectively, among the genres and text types based on the analysis conducted by Biber (1988).

As to ATC corpus, the additional features not included in Nini’s MAT program (e.g., discourse markers, length of turns, etc.) were manually tagged. Their relative frequencies were then counted and manually normalized per 100 words. The Z-scores of the tag-counted features were subsequently calculated utilizing the SPSS 26.0 statistical software package.

# 3.3. Multi-dimensional analysis framework

Multi-dimensional analysis, as a research methodology for investigating linguistic variation in spoken and written English texts, was introduced by Douglas Biber in his influential work Variation across Speech and Writing (Biber, 1988). His primary objective was to conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis to interpret various linguistic phenomena. By utilizing a multivariate statistical procedure to identify inherent linguistic co-occurrence patterns across texts, Biber was able to significantly redefine a range of register characteristics in spoken/written discourse. The original study by Biber (1988) extensively examined and discussed six linguistic dimensions. Considering the current study’s aim is to analyze spoken discourse, D2 and D3 were excluded due to their focus on narrative/non-narrative concerns and situation-dependent reference, which renders them less relevant for the comparative study of spoken exchanges. The dimensions utilized for comparative MD analysis between AE and CE are demonstrated in Tables 3 and 4.

Table 3 Descriptions of the dimensions used in AE/CE comparative MD analysis (Adapted from Biber, 1988).

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Dimension description</td></tr><tr><td>D1</td><td>Involved vs. Infomational discourse: A high scre indicaes the text i affctive and interactional.

The text presents many passive clauses and conjuncts (among other features).</td></tr><tr><td>D6</td><td>On-line informational elaboration: A high score indicates the text is informational in nature but produced under certain time constraints. The text presents many post-modifications of noun phrases (among other features).</td></tr></table></body></html>

In order to address the research questions, a set of independent-samples t-tests were conducted to examine whether and how the ATC and SB corpora differ across the four functional dimensions. The Z-scores of the linguistic features were subsequently compared. Additionally, EFA was conducted on the ATC corpus to extract and interpret the co-occurring linguistic features of routine AE and non-routine AE. After carefully examining the data for analysis, initial data screening was conducted to test for multivariate outliers, singularity, correlation and multicollinearity of variables using SPSS 26.0. Results indicated that the dataset met relevant assumptions of factor analysis.

To distinguish between the two sub-registers of AE, the patterns of co-occurring linguistic features in AE were extracted and interpreted through EFA and MD analysis. The set of linguistic features used in the study were based primarily on prior studies, e.g., White (1994), Biber (1988), and Friginal (2008). Additional features, which are not included by tagging program but relevant to AE, such as discourse markers (e.g., Roger, copy), politeness markers (e.g., Thanks, Thank you, appreciate, please), temporal adverbs, markers of cause and result, verb for intention (e.g., want, intend), respect markers (e.g., sir), filled pauses (e.g., uhm, uhh, hmm), and the features that are potentially influenced by external unexpected situations (e.g., length of turns), were incorporated into the dataset.

To finalize the combination of feature items for analysis, preliminary factor analysis were conducted piloting various combinations from the pool of over 45 tag-counted linguistic metrics. Linguistic features that correlated below 0.250 in communality values after extraction and the features did not load in any of the factors were excluded. After a series of tests, 25 lexical and syntactic features, shown in Table 5, were used in the final MD analysis.

# 4. Results

This section presents descriptive data for each dimension, followed by inferential statistics results of comparative MD analysis between AE and CE. Additionally, EFA results are reported and the extracted factors are subsequently interpreted functionally. Each dimension is accompanied by excerpts to provide a comprehensive understanding.

4.1. RQ1: How do AE and CE vary in terms of their linguistic features?

Table 6 summarizes the results of the independent-samples t-tests conducted on the dimension scores of the ATC and SB corpora. The results demonstrate significant differences between the two corpora in terms of scores for D1, D4, D5, and D6.

Table 6 The results of t-tests for the scores between the ATC and SB corpora along four dimensions.

$\mathrm { ~ : ~ p < 0 . 0 5 ~ }$ , \*\* $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 1$ , $^ { * * * } \mathrm { { p } } < 0 . 0 0 1$

4.1.1. Dimension 1: involved vs. informational discourse

Low scores on Dimension 1 (D1) indicate that the text or corpus is informationally dense (Biber, 1988, p.129). As shown in Table 6, the D1 scores of the ATC corpus $\mathbf { M } = - 3 . 8 2$ , ${ \sf S D } = 9 . 6 2  $ ) are significantly lower than those in the SB corpus $\mathrm { \Delta } M = 2 8 . 6 1$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 8 . 0 8 $ ), indicating that AE exhibits a higher level of information condensation compared to CE. Notably, low scores on D1 are associated with a distinct linguistic feature, namely the frequent utilization of nouns, adjectives, and longer words. A close examination of the Z-scores of these features demonstrated that the ATC corpus has more words with longer average word length, more attributive adjectives and nouns than the SB corpus, as indicated in Table 7.

Table 7 The Z-scores of attributive adjectives, nouns and word length in the ATC and SB corpora.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Corpus</td><td>Attributive adjectives</td><td>Nouns</td><td>Word length</td></tr><tr><td>ATC</td><td>0.79</td><td>2.8</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>1.31</td><td>0.68</td><td>1.85</td></tr></table></body></html>

According to Biber (1988), a higher frequency of attributive adjectives can be indicative of a more “careful integration of information in a text” (p. 104). However, the frequency of attributive adjectives is higher due to the fact that SP has more attributive adjectives e.g., correct, short, affirmative, negative, left, right, as illustrated in EX1 and EX2.

EX1 (Non-routine ATC050)

ATCO: United 2664, just to make sure you have crash fire rescue available at the end of the runway first.

Pilot: Affirmative, United 2664.

EX2 (Non-routine ATC040)

ATCO: N711CB, the airport is behind you at this time. You can either make a right or left turn and you should line back up for the airport.

Pilot: Roger, I’m gonna make a left turn, for 1CB.

The higher frequency of nouns may be partially related to a lower frequency of first person pronouns. As demonstrated in EX3 and EX4, the pronouns have been omitted.

EX3 (Routine ATC002)

Pilot: Buffalo Approach, 86F, do see some moderate precipitation in front of me. Just want to make sure you guys are looking out there for me.

ATCO: 86F, affirmative. I’m showing nothing between you and G-TECO. Beyond that, it does look like there’s some moderate precip, but Rochester approach will give you vector around that if you need it.

Pilot: Awesome, thank you so much, 86F.

EX4 (Non-routine ATC028)

Pilot: Kennedy, Endeavour 5145, just want to let you know, so our problem is that that we’re [sic], all three heading sensors are showing something different, so we don’t know which one to follow.

ATCO: Okay, understood.

As observed in ATC corpus, the safety-related information expressed by nouns, such as runway in use, visibility, temperature, wind direction and strength, dewpoint, and QNH, is frequent in instruction and clearance, as illustrated in EX5.

EX5 (Non-routine ATC030)

ATCO: JetBlue 1601, information Foxtrot. If you don’t have it, I can read it.

Pilot: Yeah, go ahead for JetBlue 1601.

ATCO: JetBlue 1601, 1651Zulu, wind 030, 12 gusts 19, visibility 10, few clouds 7,500 feet to 25,000, temperature 21, dewpoint 2, altimeter 32.60, landing and departing 4 left and 4 right.

A close examination of the ATC corpus revealed that the content words, such as aircraft callsigns, dominate the sentences, as illustrated in EX6. Additionally, there is low frequency of function words, as shown in EX6 and EX7. These characteristics contribute to relatively longer word length observed in the corpus.

EX6 (Routine ATC002)

Pilot: Buffalo departure, Cherokee 4182J, turning 090 and climbing to 2500.

ATCO: Cherokee 4182J, Buffalo departure, radar contact, altitude at your discretion.

EX7 (Routine ATC018)

ATCO: Alaska 822, radar service terminated, frequency change approved, good day.

Pilot: Radar service terminated, Alaska 822.

4.1.2. Dimension 4: overt expression of persuasion

High scores on Dimension 4 (D4) indicate the explicit expression of the author’s perspective and his/her evaluation of likelihood and/or certainty within the text. Conversely, low scores on D4 suggest the absence of explicit indications regarding the author’s viewpoint and his/her assessment of probability and/or certainty, as discussed by Biber (1988, p. 148). The D4 scores for the ATC corpus $\mathbf { M } = - 2 . 0 5$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 3 . 8 0 $ ) are significantly lower than those in the SB corpus $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { M } = - 1 . 7 0$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 8 8 $ ), indicating that the author’s point of view in AE is not overtly marked than CE. One notable linguistic feature associated with low scores on D4 is the restricted usage of modal verbs. Biber (1988) classified modal verbs into different categories, including possibility modals (e.g., can, may), necessity modals (e.g., should, must), and predictive modals (e.g., will, shall) (p. 148). These modal verbs can be further grouped into three functional classes: (1) those marking permission, possibility, or ability; (2) those marking obligation or necessity, and (3) those marking volition or prediction (Quirk et al., 1985, pp. 219236). As indicated in Table 8, the Z-scores of modal verbs in ATC corpus are lower than those in the SB corpus. The limited presence of modal verbs within ATC corpus contributes to the lower D4 scores.

Table 8 The Z-scores of modal verbs in the ATC and SB corpora.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Corpus</td><td>Necessity modals</td><td>Possibility modals</td><td>Predictive modals</td></tr><tr><td>ATC</td><td>0.79</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.76</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>0.47</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.88</td></tr></table></body></html>

As is observed in ATC corpus, can and may in AE are generally used to seek or grant permission to do something or to express possibility. For example, may is used to express possibility as indicated in EX8. Can is utilized to grant permission as indicated in EX10 and EX11. Should is used to suggest that something is expected or required as shown in EX9, or indicate expectations or likelihood based on a situation or condition as indicated in EX11. Will in AE is commonly used to mark volition or prediction as indicated in EX10 and EX11.

EX8 (Non-routine ATC011)

ATCO: United 574, do you have an update there if you can?

Pilot: Well, the gear failed to retract and then we recycled it and the gear is down and we’re gonna call maintenance and may have to burn some gas for our return to San Fran.

ATCO: Okay, so right now you say you’re gonna go back to San Francisco? Would you like a vector back to the north now?

Pilot: Affirm.

EX9 (Non-routine ATC017)

ATCO: JetBlue 1731, you should be out very soon. You’re right through an area of some more weather there.

Pilot: Yeah, we just took a bolt of lightning for JetBlue 1731.

EX10 (Non-routine ATC029)

ATCO: Wisconsin 6146, follow that traffic. Clear visual approach runway 25L and you can take as much space as you need to get in.

Pilot: I will clear visual 25L, 6146.

EX11 (Non-routine ATC003)

ATCO: Waterski 4697, proceed on course to the field. You can report it in sight and just let me know if there’s anything else we can do for you.

Pilot: Okay, we’ll report it in sight, and I appreciate that. Hopefully, should be down pretty quick here for 4697.

4.1.3. Dimension 5: abstract vs. non-abstract information

High scores on Dimension 5 (D5) indicate that the text or corpus conveys information using technical, abstract, and formal language. In genres with high D5 scores, there is a frequent use of conjuncts, agentless passives and by-passives, past participial clauses, WHIZ deletions, and certain types of adverbial subordination. Conversely, genres or texts with low scores on D5 exhibit the opposite characteristics (Biber, 1988, p. 151). The D5 scores for the ATC and SB corpora were both negative ( 3.11 vs. 1.70), indicating both AE and CE are less technical, abstract and formal. However, the D5 scores for the ATC corpus $\mathbf { M } = - 3 . 1 1$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 0 7 _ { , }$ ) are significantly lower than those in the SB corpus $\mathrm { \Delta } [ \mathrm { M } = - 1 . 7 0$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 8 8$ ), indicating AE is less technical, abstract and formal than CE. Two important linguistic features characterizing high D5 scores are conjuncts and passive clauses, including agentless passives and by-passives (Biber, 1988, p. 151). As indicated in Table 9, the Z-scores of agentless passives, by-passives, and conjuncts in the ATC corpus are lower than those in the SB corpus.

Table 9 The Z-scores of passive clauses and conjuncts in the ATC and SB corpora.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Corpus</td><td>Agentless passives</td><td>By-passives</td><td>Conjuncts</td></tr><tr><td>ATC</td><td>1.14</td><td>0.62</td><td>0.69</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>0.73</td><td>0.51</td><td>0.45</td></tr></table></body></html>

Conjuncts are words that connect phrases or clauses within a sentence, such as and, or, but, and because. As is observed in ATC corpus, the clauses in instruction and clearance is rarely connected by conjuncts. For example, Cleared to destination via flight planned route, Runway 18L, LMO-02 Departure, initially climb to 4100ft, cruising level 310, when airborne contact 121.7, squawk 2323.

A close examination of the ATC corpus revealed that the passives are infrequently used, as the verb Be and the agent are frequently absent in standard phraseology as shown in EX12.

EX12 (Routine ATC009)

ATCO: Radar service terminated. Frequency change approved.

Pilot: Roger, have a good day.

4.1.4. Dimension 6: on-line information elaboration

High scores on Dimension 6 (D6) indicate the text or corpus is informational in nature but produced under certain constraint. According to Biber (1988), low scores on D6 indicate that the text or corpus is not produced online or under realtime condition (p.156). The D6 scores for the ATC corpus $\mathbf { M } = - 2 . 6 1$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 8 2$ ) are significantly lower than those in the SB corpus $\mathbf { M } = 0 . 6 7$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 2 2 { \it 2 }$ ), indicating that AE exhibits fewer features of texts produced online than CE.

Low D6 scores features limited usage of demonstratives and that-clauses, including that complements to verbs (e.g., We acknowledge that .) or adjectives (e.g., We are confident that .) and that relative clauses in object positions (e.g., the situation that we are in .) (Biber, 1988, p. 154). As shown in Table 10, the Z-scores for that-clauses and demonstratives of ATC courpus are lower than those in the SB corpus.

Table 10 The Z-scores of that-clauses and demonstratives in the ATC and SB corpora.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Corpus</td><td>That-clauses as verb components</td><td>That-clauses on object positions</td><td>That-clauses as adjectival complements</td><td>Demonstratives</td></tr><tr><td>ATC</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.47</td><td>1.57</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.91</td></tr></table></body></html>

As is observed in ATC corpus, that refers to something that has already been mentioned in the instruction as demonstrated in EX13 and EX14. Additionally, that is utilized to initiate subordinate clauses as shown in EX15 and EX16.

EX13 (Non-routine ATC028)

ATCO: Endeavour 5145, we’re going to give you a frequency change, just let me know when you’re ready to copy that.

Pilot: Go ahead for that frequency change.

ATCO: Endeavour 5145, contact Kennedy Departure on 132.4.

Pilot: 32.4, Endeavour 5145, thanks for all your help.

EX14 (Non-routine ATC029)

ATCO: Skywest 6575, we do see the 210 to the west. There’s an aircraft inbound on an emergency. We’ll see how quickly we get to runway back.

Pilot: Roger that. 210, we’re slowing right now, Skywest6575.

EX15 (Non-routine ATC022)

Pilot: Yeah, and we’re looking, just finishing our last checklist and we’ve got some overweight landing stuff that we need to do and that’s the reason for 31L, the longest one.

ATCO: DAL838, understood.

EX16 (Non-routine ATC027)

ATCO: And just to verify, Intel 12, do you see the aircraft and you said that it looks like boats are heading towards them now?

Pilot: Um, yes sir, we still have them on our camera. They’re on the ground, sorry, on the water. Boats are reaching out, multiple of them, Intel 12.

4.2. RQ2: How are the linguistic features of AE in routine situations distinct from those in non-routine situations?

To address the second research question, factor analysis was conducted by SPSS 26.0. The results from Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure for Sampling Adequacy $( \mathrm { K M O } = 0 . 7 5 0 ) _ { . }$ and Bartlett’s Test for Sphericity (Approx. Chi-Square $= 1 3 6 9 . 4 6 5$ , d $\mathbf { f } = 3 0 0$ , $\mathrm { P } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) indicated that partial and observed correlations in the data were sufficient for factor analysis. As shown in Figure 1, the scree plot of Eigenvalues indicates that the curve becomes flatter from the third dot. That is to say, the first two factors appear to be the ideal factor solution.

![](img/60c594a79175495f2a34ebcdf4e1636a6af086ffb94165a30a95899ce4038beb.jpg)  
Figure 1. Scree plot of eigenvalues.

SPSS Principal Axis Factoring with Promax rotation was used in the extraction of factors. The result of the analysis produced a two-factor solution, as shown in Table 11, which was considered as the most interpretable and comprehensible combination of features among the various tested solutions (including five and six-factor solutions). The two-factor solution accounted for a cumulative percentage of 36.330 of the Initial Eigenvalues (Total Variance Explained). Applying a criterion of $+ / - 0 . 3 0$ for variable inclusion in factor interpretation, it was observed that three out of the 25 features did not exhibit significant loading on any factor.

The dimension scores were calculated by summing or subtracting the Z-scores of the dimension features following the features’ polarities within a dimension (Biber, 1988, p. 93). The Z-scores of the linguistic features were subsequently compared. Further t-tests were also conducted between the two datasets. As shown in Table 12, the mean scores and the Zscores of all linguistic features of non-routine AE subcorpus across factors 1 and 2 (Dimensions 1 and 2) are higher than those in routine AE subcorpus.

# 5. Discussion and implications

# 5.1. Discussion on the results from research question 1

As regards the first research question, the results of the comparative MD analysis of ATC and SB corpora revealed several significant findings regarding the linguistic features and variation of AE compared to CE. The ATC and SB corpora differ significantly in four dimensions (i.e. D1, D4, D5, and D6). The lower scores in the four dimensions for ATC corpus highlight that AE tends to exhibit characteristics of being more informationally condensed, less explicit in expressing the author’s viewpoint, less technical, abstract, and formal, as well as fewer features of texts produced online. The constant polarity of AE dimension scores demonstrates that AE has stable and consistent genre features.

# 5.1.1. Dimension 1: involved vs. informational discourse

AE is more informationally condensed than CE, as indicated by its lower D1 scores. The lower D1 scores result from a higher frequency of attributive adjectives, nouns and longer word length. With regard to attributive adjective, the frequency of attributive adjectives is higher due to the fact that standard phraseology has more attributive adjectives, e.g., clear, correct, affirmative, negative, left, right, etc. For example, the negative commands in AE are not initiated by Don’t but by negative. Inability to comply with an instruction must be expressed using “Unable to comply” (Estival et al., 2016, p. 36). As regards nouns, the higher frequency of nouns may be partially related to a lower frequency of first person pronouns. Only first person pronouns, I and more often we, and the second person pronouns, you, are used in AE (Estival et al., 2016, p. 37). AE is characterized by the widespread lack of pronouns, especially the references to you, as a very significant proportion of ATC transmissions are imperative, either instructions or requests (Lopez et al., 2013). Moreover, the large number of aircraft under the control of the same ATCO at the same time urges the adoption of specific callsigns for each aircraft, such as airline and flight numbers (e.g., Delta 323, Fastair 345, Speedbird 981), instead of using personal pronouns (e.g., I, we, you). Similarly, the ATCO must be identified by the air traffic control facility (e.g., Miami Center, Brasilia Control, GRU Tower) to avoid confusion (Prado & Tosqui-lucks, 2019, p. 114). Additionally, standard phraseology is basically specific and is uttered by dialogue participants in a particular definite order to satisfy communication procedures (Borowska, 2017, p. 130), and the safety information contains runway in use, visibility, temperature, wind direction and strength, dewpoint, QNH and other information. The pilot generally reads back the essential safety-related information, e.g., wind data, QNH and runway number (Robertson & Johnson, 2008, p. 3). The safety-related information is expressed by nouns. In terms of word length, it serves as an indicator of information, for longer words convey more specialized meanings than shorter words (Forchini, 2011, p. 66). In AE, there is no place for empty or meaningless structures and forms. Unnecessary words are eliminated, and content words thus dominate the sentence. As ellipsis is commonplace, the percentage of short function words, e.g., auxiliary, is relatively low. This finding is partly aligned with Estival et al. (2016) who argued that auxiliary and modal verbs are not part of the phraseology (p. 36) and Borowska (2017) who stated that the subject and an appropriate form of verb Be are ellipted when pilot describes his actions in progress as this is standard activity and the subject is generally known, e.g., when ready/if unable/unable RVSM due turbulence (p. 155).

# 5.1.2. Dimension 4: overt expression of persuasion

AE tends to be more implicit than CE in terms of presenting the author’s viewpoint, as indicated by its lower D4 scores. The lower D4 scores are due to the restricted usage of modal verbs. This finding is partly aligned with Estival et al. (2016) who argued that auxiliary and modal verbs are not part of the phraseology (p. 36). Safety is paramount in aviation, requiring communication to be unambiguous and leaving minimal room for interpretation. As modal verbs can introduce uncertainty, it is undesirable during operations. Most modal verbs can only be observed in specific non-routine contexts in AE, resulting in a lower frequency of modal verb in AE as a whole compared to CE.

# 5.1.3. Dimension 5: abstract vs. non-abstract information

AE is less technical, abstract and formal than CE, as indicated by its lower D5 scores. The lower D5 scores are due to limited usage of passive clauses and conjuncts. The infrequent usage of conjuncts is due to the fact that AE focuses on coordinating current and future aviation operations. There is little need for the digressions, asides and elaborations typically connected by conjunctions. Furthermore, AE aims for precise meaning. Conjunctions can sometimes introduce ambiguity. In terms of the lower frequency of passives, the agentless passive is any form of verb Be that is followed by a participle or nominal form. This is consistent with a remarkable feature of AE: Be is invisible in standard phraseology, e.g., Runway vacated/No delay expected/ Cleared for take-off/Cleared to land, while their equivalent sentences in CE are Runway is vacated/No delay is expected/You are cleared for take-off/You are cleared to land.

# 5.1.4. Dimension 6: on-line informational elaboration

AE exhibits fewer features of texts produced on-line than CE, as indicated by its lower D6 scores. Lower D6 scores are due to limited usage of demonstratives and that-clauses, including that complements to verbs or adjectives. In terms of the demonstratives, people often use demonstratives (e.g., this, that, here, and there) in CE to refer to objects or ideas that are physically present or understandable due to the fact that the speakers assume that they share a common physical or cultural context, which makes it easier to identify and refer to objects or concepts without the need for precise and unambiguous language. In contrast, AE is designed to be precise and unambiguous. Most entities referenced in AE (e.g., aircraft, callsigns, and positions) have fixed, explicit referents that do not require disambiguation using demonstratives.

That-clauses, which are subordinate clauses that begin with the word that, can add complexity and ambiguity to sentences by making them more difficult to parse and understand. CE is often more informal and less time-sensitive than AE, so speakers may use more complex sentence structures, including that-clauses, to convey their meaning more precisely or to emphasize certain points. However, AE is used in a safety-critical context where time is of the essence. In such scenarios, pilots and ATCOs tend to avoid using complex sentence structures, including the that-clauses.

# 5.2. Discussion on the results from research question 2

The resulting factors and the co-occurring linguistic features in two opposing poles of each factor are interpreted functionally in the following sections on the basis of grammatical rules, register and textual characteristic of ATC corpus to better reveal and understand the functional characteristics and the significance of these distributions among the two sub-registers.

5.2.1. Dimension 1: present-focused, viewpoint/intention-oriented, involved production vs. information-condensed As demonstrated in Tables 13 and 14, the linguistic features comprise Factor 1 with 11 features on the positive side and 3 features on the negative side of the factor. Positive features include first and second person pronouns, present tense verbs, verb Be, predicative modals, adverbs, possibility modals, demonstratives, verbs for intention, private verbs and thatdeletion.

Table 13 The linguistic features in D1 and their functional interpretation.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Linguistic features (loading)</td><td>Functional interpretation</td></tr><tr><td>Positive sidee</td><td>First person pronouns (0.817); Present tense verb (0.760); Verb Be (0.675); Adverbs (0.634); Second person pronouns (0.629); Predictive modals (0.606); Possibility modals (0.594); Demonstrative (0.477); Verbs for intention (0.455); Private verbs (0.450); That-deletion (0.414)</td><td>present-focused, viewpoint/ intention-oriented, involved production</td></tr><tr><td>Negative side</td><td>Word length (0.874); Nouns (0.838); Attributive adjectives (0.609)</td><td>information-condensed</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 14 The linguistic features in D2 and their functional interpretation.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Linguistic features (loading)</td><td>Functional interpretation</td></tr><tr><td>Positive side</td><td>Average length of turns (0.563); Public verbs (0.390); Verbs (0.378); Clause coordinator and (0.311)</td><td>integrative information flow</td></tr><tr><td> Negative side</td><td>Prepositions (0.639); Word count (-0.623); Type/Token ratio (0.378); Roger, copy (0.369)</td><td>planned, procedural, SP intensive</td></tr></table></body></html>

First person pronouns indicate an interpersonal focus and a generally involved style and second person pronouns require a specific addressee and indicate a high degree of involvement with that addressee (Chafe, 1985, as cited in Biber, 1988, p. 225). The combination of first and second pronouns demonstrates the feature of “involved production”. In nonroutine AE, pronouns play a vital role in delineating individual roles and responsibilities under time-critical conditions. When facing emergency situations, quick and unambiguous identification of actors is paramount to ensure efficient coordination and maintain flight safety. Present tense verbs deal with topics and actions of immediate relevance. The more ready use of present tense forms in unplanned speech styles is associated with the fact that they are acquired before past or future tense forms in English (Ochs, 1979, as cited in Biber, 1988, p. 225). Biber (1986) described present tense forms as a marker of immediate, as opposed to removed situations (p. 396). The combination of verb Be and present tense verb indicates an accounting of the current status and thus reflects the feature of “present-focused”. In non-routine AE, timesensitivity requires immediately describing the current status and necessary actions, making the present tense a more suitable choice. Private verbs (e.g., understand, know, think, expect, assume) emphasize personal perspectives. Compared to fact-focused terms, private verbs stress individual standpoints. This is conducive when weighing various factors for decision making. This element indicates the feature of “viewpoint articulated”. In non-routine AE communications, explicit communication of cognitive processes plays a vital role in developing shared situational awareness when faced with rapidly changing contingency situation. By bringing mental representations and thought processes to the surface through language, pilots and ATCOs are better able to reconcile understanding, resolve uncertainties and make well-informed decisions based on common ground. Demonstrative pronouns can refer to an entity outside the text, an exophoric referent, or to a previous referent in the text itself. The demonstrative pronouns that are used without nominal referents are characterized as errors typically found in speech due to faster production and the lack of editing (Chafe, 1985, as cited in Biber, 1988, p. 226). Possibility modals (e.g., can, could, may, might) and predicative modals (e.g., will, would, shall) also load positively on this factor. Possibility modal indicates permission, possibility, and ability. It can be used to serve the communicative functions, e.g., making requests, approving requests, giving clearance, asking for information, sharing or providing information, etc. The intention words (e.g., want, intend) is used to express the intention. The combination of predictive modals and intention words illustrates that AE is intention-oriented. Adverbs typically indicate a form of expansion of ideas because they provide additional descriptive information in the texts, and are used as modifiers or adverbials attached in clauses (Biber et al., 1999, pp. 544 546). In terms of that-deletion, that-complement is identified as one of the indices of integrative function, used for idea-unit expansion in typical writing (Chafe, 1985, as cited in Biber, 1988, p. 245). The omission of complement clause markers reflects that the complementation and idea expansion occurred in spoken discourse. That-deletion loads on positive side. In non-routine contexts, speech efficiency is critically important. Omitting optional grammatical items helps increase speech speed and support the timely and effective communication of essential information. Non-routine situations often involve less standard phraseology and more plain language to resolve unexpected conditions. Avoiding unnecessary words to convey a meaning enhances expressiveness, better meeting the demands of high-efficiency communication in pressured environments. To sum up, the co-occurring features on the positive pole of the factor are functionally interpreted as “present-focused, viewpoint/intention-oriented, and involved production”.

The features on the negative side of this factor, especially nouns, adjectives and word length resemble the cluster of features in the dimension “informational condensed” identified by Biber (1988, p. 115). These features are typical of written texts and generally contrast with spoken and unplanned discourse. These features illustrate the information-packaging feature of routine AE that is similar in this sense to written, planned texts. AE exhibits more information condensation compared to CE, and concurrently, routine AE exhibits more information condensation than non-routine AE. This finding provides empirical support for Friginal’s et al. (2021) assertion that routine communicative tasks, represents one end of a register continuum with conversational English on the opposite, unrestricted end. Plain aviation English would fall somewhere between SP and conversational English (p. 45). Longer words convey more specific and specialized meaning than shorter ones (Biber, 1988, p. 104). In routine AE, where SP is frequently employed, the relatively longer SP and the reduced occurrence of function words contribute to an increased average word length. This is consistent with Borowska’s (2017) arguement that there is no place for empty or meaningless structures and forms. Unnecessary words (e.g., function words) are eliminated. The subject and an appropriate form of verb Be are ellipted when pilot describes his actions in progress as this is standard activity and the subject is generally known.

The linguistic features of Factor 1 appear to distinguish primarily between the unique characteristics of the exchanges across the routine and non-routine AE in the corpus. Factor 1 distinguishes between types of AE exchanges based on how they communicate a concern when unexpected condition occurs. To sum up, the combination of positive and negative features in Factor 1 shows a linguistic dimension (Dimension 1) that differentiates between “present-focused, intention-oriented, viewpoint-articulated, and involved production” and “information-condensed”, portraying how informational content is produced in the AE. The typical samples from EX17 to EX20 highlight some of the positive features of Dimension 1.

EX 17 (Non-routine ATC032)

ATCO: Delta 1195 Heavy, go.

Pilot: We declare an emergency for this landing gear issue.

ATCO: Delta 1195 Heavy, roger, and what are your intentions?

Pilot: We’ll come back around. We’re running the checklist. We want to come back around and try again for another landing.

Pilot: Approach, Delta 1195. We have 221 and an hour and 27.

ATCO: Alright. One hour 27 and 221. And you just want to shoot. What kind of approach you’re looking for?

Pilot: We’ll take the ILS.

ATCO: Yeah, you got the ILS 28.

Pilot: ILS 28 and can we get a long leg? About a 10-mile long leg. Well, maybe about 15 mile final.

ATCO: Delta 1195 Heavy, wilco, so you want ILS, do you want the left or the right?

EX 18 (Non-routine ATC040)

ATCO: N711CB, verify you’re on the CREPE-3 departure. It shows going left off course.

Pilot: Yeah, we deviated off course. I’m just getting the autopilot set up. We’re direct CREPE for 1CB.

EX 19 (Non-routine ATC033)

ATCO: Delta 1195 Heavy, do you want to do a low approach to see if the tower can see your gears is down and good?

Pilot: Yeah, we’ll just do the approach. We’ll go with the approach.

ATCO: You want to do, just to verify you want to do a full ILS and try and land, or do you want to do a low approach in front of the tower and have them look at your wheels?

Pilot: No, we’ll do the full approach, Delta 1195 Heavy.

EX 20 (Non-routine ATC043)

ATCO: JetBlue 209, just curious, are you on supplemental oxygen?

Pilot: Not at this time, JetBlue 209, but we’re unable to get the fumes to clear

ATCO: JetBlue 209, I’m just curious, do you have any idea how long you will need to go before you can join the approach? You can expect back to cross final at this time.

Pilot: We’ll be ready in two minutes, JetBlue 209.

5.2.2. Dimension 2: integrative information flow vs. planned, procedural and SP intensive As shown in Table 14, the linguistic items that load on the positive side of Factor 2 include average length of turns, public verbs, and conjunction and. Average length of turns is the marker of elaboration of information. Information load tends to be higher under non-routine situation due to increased uncertainty, contingency planning needs and risk factors. This necessitates more comprehensive details exchange within each turn. And, as a clause coordinator, is a general purpose connective that can mark many different logical relations between two clauses (Biber, 1988, p. 245). It is utilized to express the relationship between different elements with an aim to build an integrative depiction of the overall situation. Multiple factors must be coordinated at the same time in complicated non-routine settings. Clause coordinators aid in the integration of information from many sources and facilitate a comprehensive evaluation to the situation. The combination of the linguistic features on positive side is interpreted as “integrative information flow”.

The linguistic features that load on the negative side of Factor 2 include lexical specificity and information density features (type/token ratio), complex and abstract information features (word count), preposition and discourse markers (i.e. Roger, copy). A high type/token ratio (TTR) indicates that more specific and precise vocabulary are employed to convey ideas and concepts. TTR and word length are found to co-occur frequently in planned genre and this distributional pattern is interpreted as marking a highly exact presentation of information, conveying maximum content (Biber, 1986, p. 394). Longer words convey more specific and specialized meaning than shorter ones (Biber, 1988, p. 104). In routine AE, the utilization of SP as a planned language facilitates the communication of comprehensive safety-related information. This results in an increase in both the TTR, word length and word count. Prepositions are commonly used in SP within routine AE, such as climb/descend to, cleared to, via A1, hold short of, and traffic in sight. These prepositions indicate a processbased nature of the conveyed information. OK is also regularly used in conversation and purposeful interactions like service encounters, and serves as either a marker of information management or a backchannel (Schiffrin, 1987; Friginal, 2013, p. 137). Roger and copy in AE serve the same purpose as OK and are interpreted as a conversational device to maintain and monitor the overall flow of the exchange. To sum up, the co-occurring linguistic features on negative side of the factor are functionally interpreted as “planned, procedural and SP intensive”.

The linguistic features in Factor 2 (Dimension 2) seem to differentiate the major characteristics between “integrative information flow” in non-routine AE and “SP intensive, planned, procedural” in routine AE. The typical samples that occurred between pilots and ATCOs highlight some of the positive features of Dimension 2.

EX 21 (Non-routine ATC037)

ATCO: Connie 690 Heavy, I’m sorry if there was any confusion. You were just supposed to line up on the runway. Do you need to exit the runway and are you able to just come back around?

Pilot: We can exit the runway and come back around for Connie 690 Heavy.

ATCO: Roger, you just continue down the runway, make a left turn onto Mike, and then just let me know when you’re ready.

Pilot: Roger, we’ll make a left turn onto Mike, we’ll let you know for Connie 690.

# 5.3. Implications

The findings of the current study may contribute to the pedagogical and practical implications of AE as an English for specific purposes. The corpora compiled can be fully leveraged to support AE instructors, curriculum developers, pedagogical material writers, LPRS test designers, examiners and raters, training managers, policymakers, pilots/ATCOs in their respective roles.

# 5.3.1. The implications for AE instructors

For AE instructors, the findings have several key implications. First, AE instructors could utilize the contrastive features observed to underline how AE optimizes information transmission under time-critical conditions while CE promotes social interaction. AE instructors can underscore AE’s role as a safety-centered register by contrasting such features. Second, the most distinctive features of AE, routine AE, and non-routine AE are drawn from dimension scores. AE instructors could extract and consolidate these high-impact features or excerpts into concrete listening/speaking drills or scenario-based simulations (e.g., role-play) to increase trainees’ language sensitivity and adaptability to circumstances, cultivating flexible yet standardized communication competence. Third, it is insufficient to simply offer lists of aviation specific vocabulary to complement a learner’s current language (Dusenbury & Bjerke, 2013, p. 13). As a result, incorporating concise samples and transcripts into vocabulary and phraseology lessons can help trainees retain the core glossary more efficiently. A technical vocabulary list can provide a tool to clarify language use in radiotelephony communication and could be used for language training in aviation to help mitigate miscommunication in the workplace (Drayton & Coxhead, 2023, p. 53). On the basis of the non-routine AE subcorpus, a technical vocabulary list that includes various expressions that can be used in abnormal situations will be developed (Kim, 2023). Fourth, the corpus can be used in computer-based activities to facilitate studentcentered, discovery-based learning activities (Smart, 2014). The trainees can explore and discover more linguistic features from the corpora, such as concordance and N-gram, that might be useful in authentic communication.

# 5.3.2. The implications for curriculum designers and developers

The findings also carry insightful implications for curriculum designers and developers seeking to optimize AE training. Hedge (2001) suggested a better awareness of social language by listing expressions under functions. The dimensional analysis of linguistic features in the corpora provides an empirically validated framework for aligning curriculum objectives and the scope of content with the register’s functional priorities. This benefits the function-notional syllabus that ensures the design optimizes the development of communication competencies. Additionally, the frequency distributions of linguistic features could inform the appropriate difficulty leveling of curriculum elements, ranging from foundational to advanced. In addition, contrastive samples of AE and CE help define the progression of learning outcomes from recognition to autonomous production of optimized conventions.

# 5.3.3. The implications for pedagogical material writers

The corpus can also be exploited in preparing teaching materials to understand how a person uses language naturally in his/her community or cultural context. The corpus is utilized to know how a person speaks the language, not how a person must speak the language (Reppen, 2011; Biber & Reppen, 2015). Creating corpus-informed materials makes use of both the findings of corpora research and guiding principles in materials design (Nugraha et al., 2023, p. 25). The excerpts extracted from ATC corpus provide AE teaching material writers with sufficient authentic materials, through which the trainee is expected to be exposed to more naturally occurred AE communications and learn how pilots and ATCOs communicate in real context. Additionally, the materials can be developed with a top-down approach, the communicative functions are determined first, and then the linguistic features with all the supporting authentic samples or excerpts in corpus are categorized based on these functions, facilitating a holistic, function-based approach in linguistic feature analysis.

# 5.3.4. The implications for test designers, examiners, and raters

The implications of this research for ICAO LPRS test designers, examiners, and raters are substantial. By comparing a specialized corpus representing a particular target language use situation with a more general corpus, test developers can gain insights into the unique ways in which language is used in specific situations (Cushing, 2021, p. 552). First, the dimensional characterization of samples provides an evidence-based framework to ensure tests optimally evaluate mastery of features essential to the AE register. Second, frequency distributions guide the accurate setting of test item or task difficulty levels across competency domains. Third, the samples and excerpts populate reliable item banks and test bases that genuinely reflect target language use. Xi (2017) recommended expanding the repertoire of features investigated through corpus analysis, particularly in the area of speaking assessment (p. 572). The recordings and transcripts furnish authentic stimulus materials for the test sections, such as readback, retell, and stimulation radiotelephony.

5.3.5. The implications for training managers and policymakers

For AE training managers and policymakers, the findings illuminate strategic considerations. The gap between AE and CE highlights the significance of specific AE training and sheds light on the training practice. The current flight training philosophy and practice should be reconsidered. “On the fly” training philosophy should be avoided. As relying simply on improving CE and aviation terminology may not be beneficial to their AE learning, tailored AE courses should be provided specifically to ab initio pilots or ATCOs.

# 5.3.6. The implications for pilots and ATCOs

Pilots and ATCOs can utilize the empirical research to continually reinforce their AE proficiency beyond their initial certification requirements. The sample corpora and extracted excerpts provide them with valuable self-study materials as they can be exposed to more authentic materials. This upholds their proficiency even as roles and experience levels expand over time. Additionally, Kim (2023) stressed that pilots and ATCOs experienced significant difficulties in communicating with interlocutors in non-routine situations. The proficiency in plain English is crucial for pilots and ATCOs to effectively and efficiently convey information in situations, where standard ICAO phraseology may not be adequate (p. 35). The findings and excerpts derived from the non-routine AE subcorpus will contribute to their proficiency in using plain language in nonroutine situations.

# 6. Conclusion

This corpus-based MD analysis attempted to examine the multi-dimensional linguistic features of AE compared to CE, as well as the linguistic differences and variation between routine AE and non-routine AE. The analysis aimed to identify distinct functional features that differentiate these language varieties. The comparative MD analysis reveals that AE demonstrates a higher degree of informational condensation, a lower presence of authorial stance and technicality, and fewer instances of online information elaboration compared to CE. The EFA shows variations in the linguistic and textual composition of the two sub-registers of AE across two dimensions. Non-routine AE demonstrates a present-focused, viewpoint/intention-oriented approach, involving higher levels of integrative information flow compared to routine AE. Routine AE is characterized by a greater degree of information condensation and is planned, procedural and SP intensive. The dimensionally-profiled data obtained from this study provides a validated framework for future descriptive and applied analysis, thereby enhancing the theoretical understanding of AE. However, the current study also has some limitations. The corpus mainly comprised data from English-speaking countries, with insufficient representation of non-native English-speaking aviation contexts. Future research should aim to expand the corpus substantially in both size and cross-linguistic diversity of sources to capture a fuller picture of AE use beyond its Anglophone roots. Broadening the research database in these ways would strengthen insights into how AE is employed internationally as a lingua franca for aviation safety.
