This article reports on a study of how Business English students’ writing was received by international business practitioners. The study draws on 40 texts of five Business English students writing in three business genre sets and 1043 comments on the texts by eight international business professionals. Building on Tardy’s (2009) framework for genre knowledge and the literature on business discourse, a coding scheme was developed to categorise the comments as formal, process, rhetorical, and subject-matter dimensions of genre knowledge and their respective sub-categories. The data analysis indicates that there was notable diversity amongst the professionals’ reception of the students’ texts. The professionals were concerned with all four dimensions of genre knowledge. Although the Business English students demonstrated a high level of genre knowledge and this was generally well received, there were considerable differences between the students and the professionals in all the four dimensions. While the professionals highlighted the transactional aspects of Business English as a lingua franca, they were also concerned with linguistic issues. The study results are discussed with reference to Business English as a lingua franca, genre knowledge, and the nature of business discourse. Implications of the study for Business English teaching are also discussed.

# 1. Introduction

English for Specific Purposes (ESP) as an approach aims to prepare students to function effectively in their target situation (Basturkmen, 2010; Bruce, 2011; Chambers, 1980; Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998). However, there is often a concern with the gap between the academy and the workplace and the portability or transferability of ESP education (Artemeva, 2009; Bhatia, 2004; Bhatia & Bremner, 2012). As effective performance in the target situation may involve handling a variety of genres, the way of addressing this concern in ESP education may lie in an examination of the reception of student writing in target genres by expert users of the genres.

Research that draws on experts’ review of professional writing, including student writing in professional genres, has been quite informative. It has long been argued that writing leaves an impression on the reader (Hatch, Hill, & Hayes, 1993), and Ivanicˇ (1998) argues in favour of investigations of ‘‘readers’ impressions of the writers whose texts they have read” (p. 334) to determine whether readers construct the same impressions from reading the texts as the writers intended to convey.

Forey’s (2004) study of business professionals’ and English teachers’ reactions to the same business memos suggests that in contrast to language teachers, business practitioners tend to view texts in their profession ‘‘in a more pragmatic manner” (p. 463). Puvenesvary’s (2003) research into how business people and academics view students’ efforts at producing business memos and replies to letters of complaint reveals that business practitioners seem to employ different criteria in assessing student writing in business genres. The business practitioners (banking officers in her study) highlighted such criteria as power relationships between the writer and the reader, workplace culture, and time constraints. Their comments on language errors or visual appeal in student writing were also framed in terms of their impact on corporate image rather than linguistic proficiency. The academics (teachers of English for business), however, were more concerned with accuracy of language and formats in student texts and with their fulfillment of test requirements.

This article builds on these studies by exploring how international business professionals react to Business English students’ writing in a variety of business genres, in particular the display of genre knowledge in the students’ texts. The study contributes to current research in student writing in business contexts and the discussion of the portability of ESP education.

# 2. Literature review

This section presents a selective review of research in business discourse with a view to developing a coding scheme for processing business professionals’ reactions to or impressions of Business English students’ writing. It begins with studies that have identified factors contributing to reader impression. It then focuses on research in business discourse and Tardy’s (2009) framework for genre knowledge, all of which informs the development of the coding scheme.

# 2.1. Research on reader impressions of academic and professional writing

Research has uncovered a range of textual, intertextual, and contextual features of genres that contribute to reader impression. For example, in her study of British university students’ writing, Ivanicˇ (1998) identifies lexical, syntactic, and discoursal features associated with academic writing. Dressen-Hammouda (2008) notes ‘‘implicit textual cues” (p. 239) which are a variety of lexical, syntactic, and discoursal elements conventionally used in the academic discipline of geology that may evoke expert recognition of the writer as a disciplinary member. Lillis (2001) discusses addressivity in student academic writing in terms of the context of situation (e.g. expectations and preferences of the tutor for whom the writing is produced) and the context of culture (e.g. ideologies and practices in higher education). Regarding intertextuality, Devitt (1991) identifies referential intertextuality, which concerns reference to other texts within one text, generic intertextuality, which describes similar recurring responses to certain recurring social situations in texts of the same genre, and functional intertextuality, which captures the interaction between the genres in use in the particular community. Because patterns of reference to other texts within a given text may illuminate a profession’s activities and relationships (Devitt, 1991), referential intertextuality is of particular importance to researching reader impression.

2.2. Coding scheme for processing professionals’ reactions to Business English students’ writing

Research in business discourse provides concepts and notions that help to identify textual, intertextual, and contextual features that contribute to reader impression. Studies of business vocabulary, thematisation, linguistic realisations of speech acts, cohesion, and business genres are highly relevant and are reviewed below.

Nelson (2000, 2006) distinguishes business lexis from words in everyday communication. For example, nouns used in business represent business-related institutions, concepts, places, and activities. Adjectives tend to be positive and impersonal. Verbs are dynamic public verbs in that they denote public business activities. These words also tend to co-occur, resulting in quite stable multi-word units. For example, the word ‘‘money” typically co-occurs with ‘‘client,” ‘‘market,” and ‘‘laundering” in a financial services corpus rather than ‘‘spend” or ‘‘save” as is the case in a general English corpus (Cheng, 2009, pp. 489–490). Building on Hyland (1998a), Nickerson (2000) illustrates a range of linguistic devices used for achieving interpersonal goals in business communication such as hedges, passives, emphatics, attributors, attitude markers, relational markers, and intertextual markers. The hedges, emphatics, and attitude markers may be grouped into the category of boosters (see Holmes, 1984; Hyland, 1998b), which is adapted in this study to refer to words and expressions that present the communicator and their organisation in a positive light or make substantial demands on clients or business partners.

Research into thematisation concerns the choice of a particular element to begin a clause (Halliday, 1994). Since the element placed in the initial position in a clause imposes a perspective on what comes next, thematisation serves to highlight a certain interpretation of the event represented by the clause (Brown & Yule, 1983; Halliday, 1994). It is thus a powerful device in constructing professional discourse. For example, a business memo in which personal pronouns were thematised (e.g. human agents used to introduce an unpleasant situation) was perceived as less business-like by the business professional and language teacher informants than a version in which institutional entities were thematised (Forey, 2004). Similarly, thematisation is useful in business negotiation. In Planken’s (2005) study, the professional business negotiators thematised the first person plural ‘‘we” when expressing disagreement while novice negotiators tended to choose the first person singular ‘‘I.” The choice of the theme and the perspective had a significant impact on the way the disagreement was perceived.

Research concerning speech acts in business discourse deals predominantly with politeness and strategies for performing such potentially face-threatening speech acts (Brown & Levinson, 1987) as request, complaint, and disagreement (Kong, 1998, 2006; Maier, 1992; Stalpers, 1995; Wang, 2010). Kong’s study of Chinese business letters shows that both requests in routine business correspondence (1998) and requests or directives in internal emails (2006) were accompanied by some justification. Interestingly, requests or directives by managers to subordinates were justified more often than those by peers, which Kong (2006) suggests was due to the dilemma of the modern workplace where workers are required to achieve institutional goals while also being allowed to perform autonomously to varying extents. Maier’s (1992) study of native and nonnative English writers’ requests for a second job interview indicates that the native writers used more politeness strategies than the non-native writers. The non-native writers also incorporated more personal details in their letters. These studies lend support to Scollon and Scollon’s (2001) argument that there is no such thing as faceless communication.

Cohesion is another area of business discourse relevant to this study as it is essential to the texture of a text (Halliday & Hasan, 1976). For example, Ellis and Johnson (1994) note that logical relations in business texts are clearly signalled as a way of achieving clear communication. They illustrate their point with the causal relationship which is explicitly indicated by expressions such as for this reason. What is interesting about such expressions for business writing is their position in a sentence, that is, whether they are chosen as textual theme (Halliday, 1994).

Research in business genres is also relevant to this study in that it contributes to understanding the functions and structures of texts in the various genres. For example, Bhatia (1993) describes cover letters for job applications as performing a clarificatory rather than descriptive function with a seven-move structure. Such research findings provide important reference points for examining student writing in business genres.

As these textual, intertextual, and contextual features represent various aspects of knowledge of business genres, they are useful reference points or ‘‘a priori codes” (Duff, 2008, p. 160) for processing business professionals’ comments on Business English students’ writing. These features may also be put into a framework for systematic examination. Tardy’s (2009) framework of genre knowledge is useful for this purpose. She identifies four dimensions of genre knowledge: formal, process, rhetorical, and subject-matter. The formal dimension involves conventions of lexical choices, syntactic choices, and structural features at the discoursal level such as the moves commonly associated with the genre (Swales, 1990) and their content. It also involves the medium and mode in which the genre is instantiated. Finally, it involves the linguistic code. The process dimension is concerned with the processes by which the genre is produced, distributed, and received. Knowledge of intertextuality, that is, the relationship between the genre in question and other genres, is also part of the process dimension of genre knowledge. The rhetorical dimension is concerned with the writer’s knowledge of the task, purpose, and the power relationship between the writer and the reader enacted by the genre, and the strategies that can be applied for the rhetorical purpose. The subject-matter dimension represents the disciplinary or professional knowledge required to produce the genre.

Tardy’s (2009) framework and the studies of business discourse have informed the development of a coding scheme for this study. In the coding scheme (see Appendix A), the dimensions of formal, process, rhetorical, and subject-matter knowledge are used as general categories for coding business practitioners’ comments on Business English students’ writing. Under each general category are a number of specific categories or sub-categories, which relate to their specific comments on various textual, intertextual, and contextual features of student writing in business genres.

# 3. Methodology

This study represents a qualitative examination of international business professionals’ perceptions of a variety of student writing in business genres. This section presents the study participants and procedures for collecting and processing the data.

# 3.1. Participants

The data for this article were produced by five Business English students and eight international business professionals. The student participants were selected from a cohort of 57 Business English students who were undertaking a four-year undergraduate programme at the International Business Studies University (a pseudonym, hereafter IBSU for short), one of the most prestigious universities in Beijing, China. They will be referred to in the study as An, Dong, Mei, Nan, and Lan (pseudonyms). Dong (male) and Lan (female) were ranked among the top students in their class, An (female) and Mei (female) among the middle tier, and Nan (male) among the bottom tier according to IBSU’s student ranking system which considers both academic and extra-curricular accomplishments of students. At the time of data collection, they had completed a number of course units which dealt with topics such as international trade, marketing, management, intercultural communication, and English for business and they all claimed that they were acquainted with the international business world.

The eight professional participants, Leo, Luo, Qian, Qiu, Sam, Bill, Rick, and Tim (pseudonyms), were recommended by business contacts and were eventually selected on the basis of their language background, industry, and work experience. They all had university degrees. Their information is summarised in Table 1.

As is shown in Table 1, Leo was a native speaker of American English who had worked as a financial analyst for a major US auto manufacturer. He was employed by IBSU to teach business writing to the cohort of Business English students. There were three native Chinese professionals: Luo, who had previously worked for a major Chinese import and export company and was working for a foreign logistics company; Qian, who had previously worked for a major Chinese import and export company and was running her own business in plastic cosmetics; and Qiu, who was working for a US insurance company. All were fluent in English. Tim was a native speaker of Australian English doing international trade across Asia and Europe. Sam, Bill, and Rick were native speakers of American English working for a US insurance company operating in Beijing or other regions of Asia. Given the considerable diversity in these professionals’ language background, experience, and field of practice, it was anticipated that they would be able to provide relevant comments on Business English students’ writing.

# 3.2. Data collection

The data from the student participants were collected at IBSU from October 2009 to July 2010 when they were taking two compulsory course units, namely Business Letter Writing and Business Marketing Writing, during their third year of study. The students were assigned by Leo to produce three sets of texts: a cover letter and a resume to apply for a real internship or part-time job of their own choice, an order letter, a job posting, an offer letter, a counteroffer letter, a rejection letter in response to a scenario created by Leo, and a business plan to start up their own company. For the second task, the students acted in the capacity of a senior manager at a medium-size trading company, recruiting an assistant to the manager. The five focal students’ assignments, 40 texts in total, were collected as data for this study. These texts may be regarded as three genre sets (Bazerman, 2004; Devitt, 1991): the application genre set, which includes the cover letter and the resume; the recruitment genre set, which includes the order letter, job posting, offer letter, counteroffer letter, and rejection letter; and finally, the business plan. These genres together were designed to represent part of the system of genres (Bazerman, 2004) that Business English students may be expected to produce in the workplace (Zhang, 2007).

It should be mentioned that the assignments were considerably scaffolded. During the two course units, Leo discussed business skills, business concepts, and language involved in the specific type of business text. For example, in the Business Marketing Writing course, he explained to the students various aspects of marketing and business plans such as vision and mission, SWOT (strengths–weaknesses-opportunities–threats) analysis, and the structure of business plans. Specimen texts were displayed and discussed in class although there was no discussion of the texts’ structure from the perspective of genre. He also explained requirements for the assignment in the lectures. Moreover, he gave the students a number of mini-assignments covering various specific aspects of a business plan such as vision and mission statement, marketing mix, and SWOT analysis and made comments on each individual piece. These were eventually put together into a complete business plan by the students. In addition, he assigned two required readings which introduced advertising and marketing in business and business plan writing. There was therefore sufficient scaffolding for the students and their text production can be said to be a ‘‘facilitated performance” (Freedman & Adam, 1996, p. 399). This directed exposure to business writing may partly explain the students’ strong genre knowledge, which was recognised by the business professionals (see Section 4.1.1).

Leo made written comments on and awarded grades to all 40 student texts, which were collected either from the students or the faculty they were studying in. The other seven professional participants were sent the 40 texts to review with these guiding questions:

(1) What is your impression of the text?   
(2) Do you feel the text reads like professional writing? Why (not)?   
(3) What in the text, e.g. choice of words, expressions, sentence structures, rhetorical organisation, content, etc., conveyed the impression you have about it?   
(4) If you were asked to revise the text, what changes would you make? Why?

Qian and Tim commented on all the 40 texts. While the other professionals were unable to review all the texts (see Note in Appendix B), they made detailed comments on each text they read. The professionals’ comments were all in English. All the data were collected with ethics approval.

# 3.3. Data processing

The eight professionals made 1043 comments on the five focal students’ 40 texts. These comments were assigned into general categories and sub-categories according to the coding scheme discussed in Section 2.2 (also see Appendix A). There were eventually four general categories representing the formal, process, rhetorical, and subject-matter dimensions of genre knowledge and 18, 1, 5, and 4 sub-categories under each general category respectively. The number of comments in each general and sub-category for the students is summarised in Appendix B.

# 4. Results and discussion

Five major results emerged from the analysis of the categories of comments. First, the professionals were generally positive in their perceptions of the students’ writing. Second, there was considerable diversity amongst the comments made by the professionals. Third, the professionals’ comments concerned all four dimensions of genre knowledge. Fourth, there were some salient differences between the students and the professionals in terms of genre knowledge. Finally, the professionals recognised the importance of mutual intelligibility in Business English as a Lingua Franca (BELF) (see Koester, 2010; Louhiala-Salminen, Charles, & Kankaanranta, 2005) and were also concerned with the quality of the linguistic code in the students’ writing, in particular accuracy. These five results will be reported on and discussed with reference to genre knowledge, BELF, and the nature of business discourse.

It should be noted that the figures in Appendix B represent aggregate totals for the professionals’ comments on each focal student’s writing with regard to the four general categories and their sub-categories. No individual frequency counts are provided for each of the comments quoted in the article. As the professionals rarely commented on the same feature in each individual student’s text, the comments quoted in the article were often made by individual professionals. However, where the professionals commented on the same feature in a particular student’s text, all their comments are quoted or mentioned to indicate this.

Contextual information is provided for the comments in Section 4.1. For each comment cited, unless otherwise indicated in the section, the genre of the text that received the comment is indicated in square brackets [], the text being commented on is italicised, and the comments made by the professionals are indicated in parentheses ().

# 4.1. Results

# 4.1.1. Positive perceptions of the students’ writing

The five focal students were viewed as possessing high-level knowledge of the eight business genres and were recognised as writing professionally. For example, Sam was positive about Nan’s offer letter with the comment:

Very nice, polite, welcoming AND business-like.

Similarly, Tim noted that Dong ‘‘has a good understanding of appropriate business language.” He also commended Dong on his business plan:

This is an excellent business plan. Well researched, good use of graphs (visual aids are always good for presentations), lots of facts/figures to back up comments.   
Someone should hire this man!!!

The significance of this result will be discussed in Section 4.2.

4.1.2. Diversity in the professionals’ comments

There was notable diversity amongst the views expressed by the professionals regardless of their language background or professional field. As Appendix B indicates, the professionals regularly reacted to different aspects of the texts of the Business English students. For example, Qian, a Chinese business professional in the field of manufacturing, made significantly more comments on the students’ writing than Luo and Qiu, two other Chinese professionals in the fields of logistics and insurance respectively. Tim, an Australian international trader, made far more comments than Leo, the writing instructor and former financial analyst at a major US automaker. Regarding their comments on each individual student, the professionals also differed significantly. When commenting on An’s writing, for example, Luo, Qian, Qiu, Leo, Sam, and Tim made 3, 7, 26, 13, 39, and 86 comments respectively on its formal dimension. Qiu made far more comments (21 comments) on An’s process knowledge than the other professional participants who made no comments or just one comment.

4.1.3. The professionals’ concern with all four dimensions of genre knowledge

As can be seen in Appendix B, the professionals commented on all four dimensions of genre knowledge in their evaluations of the texts. The largest and second largest numbers of comments belonged to the formal dimension and the subjectmatter dimension respectively. There was also a large number of comments in the rhetorical dimension and a considerable number of comments in the process dimension. This finding provides further empirical evidence for the view that business practitioners consider a host of factors in evaluating writing in their profession (Puvenesvary, 2003). While formal features are important, process knowledge, rhetorical purpose, and content also play important roles in making a text a piece of business writing.

It is worth mentioning that the process dimension received far fewer comments than the other dimensions from the professional participants except Qiu. This does not, however, mean that it was considered to be a less important dimension of genre knowledge by the business practitioners. In fact, as Qiu noted in her review of An’s writing, the process dimension is a key aspect of business genre knowledge as the display of process knowledge reflects mastery of business processes and procedures for business operations. For example, the inclusion of referential intertextuality (Devitt, 1991) in an order letter such as Further to our talk on the phone, and Thank you for your faxed catalogue and price list represents the business practice of negotiating terms and conditions by telephone or fax prior to the writing of the order letter. The business practitioners also commented positively on the students’ use of referential intertextuality, for example, Tim’s comments on Dong’s business plan cited in Section 4.1.1. This will be further discussed in Section 4.1.4.2.

4.1.4. Differences between the students and the professionals in genre knowledge

There were considerable differences between the students and the professionals in all four dimensions of genre knowledge, in particular the perspective and thematic choice according to institutionalised roles, the choice of direct and indirect speech acts, the conventionalised move structures, the choice of media and modes at different stages of interaction, the balance between an impersonal and a personal tone, the preference for positive over negative presentation, and the various tacit rules for content selection. These differences are useful information for Business English teaching as they reflect expectations of practitioners in the business world. These differences are categorised into the formal, process, rhetorical, and subject-matter dimensions and are illustrated in Sections 4.1.4.1, 4.1.4.2, 4.1.4.3, and 4.1.4.4 in turn.

4.1.4.1. The formal dimension. Differences between the students and the professionals in the formal dimension are salient in the sub-categories of boosters, perspective and thematisation, speech acts, expansion (i.e. adding a word or expression in the text) or deletion (removing a word or expression from the text). The professionals had a special way of making use of boosters, as will be illustrated in examples (1) to (7) below.

(1) [In the resume] Proficient (Good term) in Microsoft Office (2) [In the resume] Good (exceptional) written . . . skills

In the first example, which is from a resume, the professional commended the student on the choice of ‘‘proficient,” which was a booster of the student’s computer literacy. In the second example, also from a resume, the professional commented that the student should replace ‘‘good” with ‘‘exceptional” to boost the student’s writing skills. The professionals also used boosters to upgrade the requirements of job candidates as in the next two examples:

(3) [In the job posting] Be able to use Microsoft Office (A bit better to say proficient with) (4) [In the job posting] Interested applicants can (must) send resume to

In example (3), the version suggested by the professional stipulated a higher level of computer literacy of the candidate(s) than the student’s version. The higher modality of ‘‘must” than ‘‘can” gave the statement (example 4) the power of an instruction.

However, the professionals moderated the students’ statements of obligations. For example, Mei wrote this in her busi ness plan:

(5) In the short term, the new entrant, Moonlight Café will (this means $1 0 0 \%$ – a guarantee. A better phrase is ‘‘aims to achieve.”) achieve a $3 0 \%$ market share within $2 \mathrm { k m }$ area of the first café, where its main consumers are college students and young office workers.

In this instance, Tim changed ‘‘will” to ‘‘aims to achieve” because by writing ‘‘will,” Mei was suggesting that she could guarantee a $3 0 \%$ return. Mei seemed to be trying to persuade her audience to accept her business plan as practical, but risked exaggerating her possibility of success.

While the professionals used boosters when describing their own qualifications and skills, they removed boosters when describing those of their readers, as in example (6), where the booster ‘‘perfectly” was substituted with ‘‘well” by Sam. In example (7), the word ‘‘distinguished” which was used to compliment the target university was received unfavourably by Tim.

(6) [In the rejection letter] Your experience and capability is perfectly suited for the job. (Use well. ‘‘perfect” is too constraining – can you fire a ‘‘perfect” employee?)   
(7) [In the cover letter] by your distinguished (too strong) university

In the next three examples, the revisions of the students’ writing by the professionals indicate how thematisation and perspectives were handled differently by the students and the professionals.

(8) [In the cover letter] To use the knowledge I learned from my professional training in Business English (Based upon my education in Business English.)   
(9) [In the business plan] I believe our cake shop can be widely successful (Based on the encouraging growth and success of our first two stores, we believe that we can profitably enlarge our business.)   
(10) [In the business plan] There are lots of other reasons for the customers (other customers who have a reason) to make a cake by themselves.

The student’s text in example (8) highlighted the potential personal benefit the applicant may gain from the employment whereas the revised version changed the perspective by emphasising the mutual benefits that may ensue as a result of employing this candidate. The student’s original text in example (9) foregrounded an individual belief while the revised version explicitly stated the rationale for the belief. Example (10) is taken from the market segmentation section in a business plan where the writer was discussing potential customers of his DIY (Do It Yourself) cake shop. The professional’s comment on the student’s text emphasised the importance of targeting different types of customers rather than their reasons for making DIY cakes. These examples suggest that in business writing, the writer is enacting institutionalised roles that require them to adopt appropriate perspectives on the message to transmit.

The professionals were also observed to realise speech acts in different ways to the students, as can be seen in examples (11) and (12) which are from the students’ order letters.

(11) Would you please help us place an electronic advertisement for our recruitment information on your website? (Please place the following advertisement on your website.)   
(12) We hope the advertisement could meet the following requirements (The advertisement should meet the following conditions.)

In example (11), the student framed the request as an appeal for assistance following the ‘‘suggestory formulae” whereas the professional’s alternative, despite the addition of ‘‘please,” was framed as an instruction, which is the most direct way for making a request (Blum-Kulka, House, & Kasper, 1989, p. 18). In example (12), the request was originally framed by the student as a ‘‘want statement” instead of the ‘‘obligation statement” in the revised version (Blum-Kulka et al., 1989, p. 18). The students seemed to be following textbook teaching on politeness in their realisations of speech acts while in professional practice, politeness may give way to pragmatic concerns (Forey, 2004), as is also made clear by Tim’s comment on An’s order letter:

As ‘‘you” are paying for the job advertisement to be placed, you don’t have to be ‘overly’ (too much) polite.

The professionals treated politeness in more subtle ways, for example, by addressing the reader (William Smith) by their first name as in example (13), or using an appropriate modal verb as in example (14), depending on the level of imposition (Brown & Levinson, 1987):

(13) That’s all of the advertisement. We hope to find some qualified applicants through it. Thank you for your time. (Thanks for your assistance William and please let me know if you require any further details.)   
(14) We would appreciate it if you could kindly post (would post) the advertisement in an optimal location on your web page.

Example (13) was revised by Tim who added the reader’s first name ‘‘William” and example (14) was revised by Bill who also revised the examples (11) and (12) from requests into instructions. It is interesting to compare Bill’s handling of examples (11), (12), and (14). As the request in (14) was more demanding than the rather routine requests in examples (11) and (12), he chose a more polite sentence and a higher modality. Business communication is not faceless communication (Scollon & Scollon, 2001), but the amount of face work required seems to be calculated on the basis of the obligations for the writer and the reader in the specific professional setting and the level of imposition of a specific speech act. This tacit knowledge was largely opaque to the students.

Words, phrases, or sentences that did not add to the clarity of the message were treated as redundant and removed while frequently words and sometimes entire clauses were added to make the point clearer, as in examples (15), (16), and (17).

(15) [In the order letter specifying when to post the job ad.] will be available, open (deleted).   
(16) [In the rejection letter] Thank you for your recent application to UIBE Importers (interest in UIBE Importers and taking your time to participate in our recruitment process).   
(17) [In the counteroffer letter] So I’m sorry to tell you that it is difficult for us to offer you a $1 0 \%$ pay increase at this moment (prior to your commencement at UIBE Importers).

‘‘Open” in example (15) was deleted since the previous word ‘‘available” clearly conveys the message. The formulaic expression of ‘‘recent application to UIBE Importers” in example (16) was expanded with an added clause extending thanks for and appreciation of the unsuccessful applicant’s effort. ‘‘At this moment” was replaced with the much clearer adverbial phrase of time ‘‘prior to your commencement at UIBE Importers” in example (17).

4.1.4.2. The process dimension. There were far fewer professionals’ comments in the process dimension than in the three other dimensions. This has been noted in Section 4.1.3. One possible reason for this is the nature of the process dimension of genre knowledge. As this aspect of genre knowledge involves the dynamics of text production, distribution, and reception, it is less easy to capture than the other aspects of genre knowledge. Research techniques such as think-aloud protocol and text-based interviews (Lillis, 2009) may help track more of the dynamics.

The specific comments available were grouped together in one sub-category representing practices in the production, distribution, and reception of texts. The most notable issue relating to the process dimension in the students’ genre knowledge was referential intertexuality (Devitt, 1991). All five focal students inserted the job posting in their email order letter and all of them except An included the terms and conditions of employment as part of the email offer letter rather than as attachments. Furthermore, there were no textual elements in their email messages (except for An’s) indicating the referential intertextuality involved. It may be conceded that in writing in the business genres, the students were addressing the context of situation (Lillis, 2001) by complying with the detailed requirements for their assignment (e.g. the students were assigned to write email letters). However, they also appeared to lack nuanced process knowledge concerning text production, distribution, and reception in professional contexts.

4.1.4.3. The rhetorical dimension. There were also notable differences between the students and the professionals in the rhetorical dimension. The professionals’ preference for a positive approach to business messages is reflected in example (18), where the rather negative message in the original was rephrased more positively as an obtainable goal by Tim, and example (19), where the rephrasing of the original by Rick removed any suggestion that the DIY cake shop might be a dangerous environment.

(18) [In the business plan] we still have a long way to go (not very positive . . . perhaps ‘‘which we are working towards over time”).   
(19) [In the business plan] Besides, the electronic machines should be safe enough (alarmingly too casual to an investor, especially with the mention of children customers in the next sentence. Liability issues are present. Statements dealing with issues like this which could cause concern should be handled more authoritatively, like: ‘‘To ensure customer safety, all our cake-baking machinery meets or exceeds the stringent standards of . . .”).

Another example of positive presentation of information can be found in Rick’s comments on Mei’s SWOT analysis in her business plan for a new coffee shop. Mei wrote:

(20) Since some famous café brands with their coffee shop chains almost spread all over Beijing and own established clientele via elegant ambience. Thus, it is difficult to surpass these coffee shop brands and attract more consumers. ([A]fter stating that ‘‘it is difficult to surpass these coffee shop brands and attract more customers,” you have to imply that there is a way to do it, perhaps by adding a phrase like ‘‘and will require careful differentiation of our service to our target customers.”)

Rick suggested expanding the last sentence by acknowledging the threat in the first clause and providing a way of addressing the threat in the second, resulting in a more positive message.

Differences were also observed in the professionals’ rhetorical knowledge in terms of their preference for an impersonal or a personal tone. Qiu made the point that 商 场 没 有 人 情 味 [‘the business world is impersonal’], a view shared by some of the other professionals. For example, Qian put a question mark beside Mei’s sentence ‘‘wish you happiness and progress in our company!” in her offer letter. However, other professionals commended the students on showing personality and emotion. For example, Leo gave credit to ‘‘injection” of personality by stating that:

As a manager, which I believe all of the students will be, they must balance professionalism and personality. Truly great leaders in the business world have their own personalities which they inject into their management styles (Leo, Personal Communication, 28 December, 2009).

Similarly, Sam made the following comment on Lan’s counteroffer letter:

I really like your tone/attitude – very understanding and welcoming!

It thus seems that being personal and friendly in workplace texts may add value but is not compulsory, as is confirmed by Tim’s comments on An’s friendly approach to the order letter (example 21):

(21) Thanks a lot. Have a nice day! (This is very friendly. Good personal touch, but is not required if the writer does not fee comfortable to write this way.)

4.1.4.4. The subject-matter dimension. The professionals attached much importance to the subject-matter dimension of genre knowledge, as indicated by the fact that the second largest number of comments belonged to this dimension (see Appendix B). Overall, the students’ writing was found to incorporate the essential information expected of the genres. For example, Luo commented on An’s, Dong’s, and Mei’s business plan saying:

All three plans can follow the basic rules in a business plan such as segmentation analysis, 7 ps, SWOT.

However, the professionals also identified unnecessary or irrelevant information in the students’ texts. For example, in example (22), ‘‘in due time” was deleted as it was considered unnecessary in the order letter since payment when due is too obvious to mention in the transaction. Furthermore, ‘‘rational” in example (23) was deleted since Mei was applying for a marketing position, for which Bill may not regard being ‘‘rational” as an attractive trait or alternatively may take it as self-evident. Example (24) is excerpted from An’s business plan where she was commenting on the power of the Internet, which Sam deemed irrelevant as the plan was intended to demonstrate the applications of the Internet to on-line teaching rather than to evaluate the Internet itself.

(22) We had pay in due time (deleted, unnecessary).   
(23) I am creative, rational, and ambitious [deleted].   
(24) With internet, nothing is impossible (deleted).

The most interesting comments in the subject-matter dimension involve information that may cause concern, contravene business principles, or appear generic. In example (25), Dong made a statement Qian questioned as risky or even rash. In example (26), Lan’s assurance was judged by Qian as questionable or possibly empty as it is against the business principle of premium price for the premium product.

(25) [In the business plan] This may cost a lot, but it worth trying. (Only trying? So costly?) (26) [In the business plan] We assure our customers enjoy the best quality at the cheapest price. (?)

In her business plan for the online education service branded I CAN, An proposed a wide range of advertising media for marketing her business, which Sam dismissed as being generic:

Avoid generic statements but make everything specific to I CAN even if it means omitting certain things. Remember the purpose of the plan is to get action NOT to have someone read it and think you are clever.

# 4.1.5. The professionals’ attitudes towards BELF

The professionals’ comments demonstrate that they viewed Business English as a lingua franca for international business and that they were aware of the different ways that English is used in different nations. For example, Bill noted differences in the use of English in China and in the US:

We are taught to be brief and to the point in our written correspondence. If something is not needed in the letter to make it more understandable, then do not say it. We are taught not to use elaborate (flowery) expressions. I do realize this is a cultural issue. The Chinese style of writing is more formal and polite than ours.

The professionals’ attitude towards the linguistic code is also significant. They claimed that language or grammar was not heir major concern when reviewing the students’ writing as in Rick’s comment on Dong’s business plan:

The text is clearly not written by a native English-speaker. There is never any doubt as to the meaning, but there are a number of small grammatical or usage lapses. . .. However, this is not a serious drawback to a reader who is interested in the ideas. . .. I don’t think it would give a bad impression to a businessman who was serious about reviewing the proposal.

Another example is the business practitioners’ attitude toward the Business English students’ preference for relationship building in their writing, for example, by showing emotion and adopting indirect speech acts and inductive strategies (Scollon & Scollon, 2001) even when in the specific scenario they were in the position of command. Such discursive practices are often associated with Chinese culture (Kong, 1998, 2006). These discursive practices adopted by the students were also recognised as appropriate by some of the professionals, for example Sam, who made the favourable comment on Lan’s counteroffer letter cited in Section 4.1.4.3.

It seems that for both the professionals and (some of) the students, mutual intelligibility rather than native-likeness was the criterion for international business interactions where English serves as a lingua franca (Gerritsen & Nickerson, 2009; Koester, 2010; Louhiala-Salminen et al., 2005; Nickerson, 2005). When the students were interviewed about their texts, Nan and Mei were not worried about the linguistic code of English. In fact, Nan claimed that the major difference between his texts and those of business professionals lay in ways of thinking rather than language.

However, this focus on mutual intelligibility does not mean that the linguistic code was in any way insignificant for the professional participants. A large proportion of their comments relating to the formal dimension were concerned with the linguistic code. Accuracy, connotations of words, and use of Chinglish were among the particularly weak areas in the students’ writing. For instance, Qian identified a number of expressions in the students’ writing which she dismissed as instances of ‘‘Chinglish,” as in example (27):

(27) [In the business plan] So we do not want too many discounts and low price spoil the brand (Chinglish We do not want to spoil the brand by offering discounts and low price from time to time.)

Linguistic proficiency was also a criterion for evaluating the writer as a professional communicator, a finding that echoes Puvenesvary’s (2003) research. For example, Mei’s claim to being an excellent communicator in her cover letter was challenged by Bill largely because of grammatical and lexical lapses in her writing. Consequently, the linguistic code, after all, appears to be an important factor in BELF, for both native and non-native users of English. Three of the students (An, Lan, and Dong) themselves felt that their texts were not yet professional writing due to their concern that their English was not native-like.

# 4.2. Discussion

The results lend support to other studies of reader impressions of business writing and add to the literature with important implications for Business English teaching. The professionals’ comments on the Business English students’ texts provide valuable insights into expectations of writing in English for international business, pointing to the institutionalised and goaloriented nature of business discourse (Bargiela-Chiappini, Nickerson, & Planken, 2007; Gunnarsson, 2009).

The business practitioners’ positive reception of the Business English students’ writing provides evidence for the indexing power of genre knowledge. International business operates within a community of practice (Wenger, 1998) with community members sharing knowledge of a repertoire of genres and genre knowledge. As the repertoire of genre knowledge constitutes the knowledge, skill, and discourse of the community of practice, it is an important indexing device for the ‘‘knowledgeably skilled identities” (Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 55) of individuals operating within particular professional contexts. The extent to which the writer is aware of the relevant genre knowledge and is capable of displaying it in situated writing provides a means of exploring the construction of professional identities by writers such as the Business English students. As they displayed considerable knowledge of the eight business genres, for example, knowledge of generic intertextuality (Devitt, 1991) in their writing, the student writers were recognised as writing professionally. This learning outcome also provides valuable evidence for the portability (Artemeva, 2009) of Business English education. That is, the divide between the academy and the workplace as is often discussed in research and practice in professional discourse (e.g. Beaufort, 1999; Bhatia, 2004; Dias, Freedman, Medway, & Paré, 1999) can be narrowed effectively through ESP education.

The diversity amongst the business professionals may be attributed to the flexibility of the target genres (Devitt, 2004). Variation in their reactions may also be taken as evidence of diverse practices in international business, which itself is an umbrella term covering a wide range of commercial and organisational activities (Chen & Wang, 2009; Zorn & Simpson, 2009). The business professionals were active in different industries, which may have prompted them to focus on different concerns in the same piece of writing. For example, Rick, a specialist in insurance, was sensitive to safety issues as can be seen from his identification of Dong’s overly casual approach to the safe operation of machines by young customers in the DIY cake shop. Preferences for adopting a more or less personal tone in business writing may be due to different perceptions of management styles in the workplace. It can therefore be argued that international business is a heterogeneous field and that there are unlikely to be uniform or universal discursive practices that characterise it; consequently, no prescriptive identity of an international business professional can be identified. Just as Hyland (2011) recognises the specificity of writing in each academic discipline, so it may be necessary to treat writing in international business with reference to the specific industry, business sector, task, or even individual under question instead of regarding it as a monolithic practice.

That the professionals were concerned with all four dimensions of genre knowledge lends support to Tardy’s (2009) argument for genre expertise as an integration of all the formal, process, rhetorical, and subject-matter dimensions of genre knowledge. This notion of integrated genre expertise also resonates with Flowerdew (2011), who describes genre knowledge in terms of action, content, and identity. The coding scheme (see Appendix A) encompassing the four aspects of genre knowledge has been, to an extent, validated.

Differences identified between the students and the professionals in handling aspects of the business genres support the idea that a gap still exists between the classroom and the profession (Beaufort, 1999; Bhatia, 2004; Dias et al., 1999). Despite their high level of genre knowledge, the students were found to lack an understanding of the more subtle aspects of genre knowledge. As illustrated in Section 4.1.4, they were particularly weak regarding the nuances or connotations of words and expressions, perspectives and thematisation, certain procedures of genre production and distribution, and proper selection of information for inclusion in their texts. The business professionals’ comments provide a clue to bridging the gap, that is, Business English students should assume the mindset of a business professional to produce professionally appropriate texts by considering the relevant rights and obligations of parties to the situated transaction.

The business practitioners’ attitude towards BELF as presented in Section 4.1.5 suggests that drawing on local practices when participating in international business communication is a strategy that should not be conclusively dismissed. Connor’s (1999) study demonstrates the use of the accommodation strategy of convergence rather than the adoption of English linguistic and cultural norms for international business communication in English. As Starke-Meyerring (2005) argues, English writing in international business in the era of globalisation is characterised by the interaction of local with globalised discourses and practices resulting in ‘‘pluralized identities” (p. 469). BELF is thus a complicated issue. Apart from the transactional function, there is also the need to consider its relational functions (Koester, 2010) and its potential for indexing international business professional identities.

This study adds to research which draws on the knowledge of professional and academic informants to enhance our understanding of professional discourses. It shows that while business practitioners indeed view texts in their profession pragmatically (Forey, 2004; Puvenesvary, 2003), they are similar to language teachers in that they also seem to be concerned with the quality of language.

While the study results are based on the researcher’s interpretation of the professionals’ comments on the students’ writing, the issue of subjectivity is minimised through the adoption of two main strategies. First, the coding scheme was developed with reference to relevant literature (see Section 2). Second, the categorisation of the comments was based on the professionals’ own explanations which helped validate the interpretation adopted. For example, the professionals’ attitudes towards BELF were derived from their use of the derogative term ‘‘Chinglish” and explicit comments on instances of Chinglish in the students’ writing.

# 5. Conclusions

This study aimed to investigate how international business professionals reacted to Business English students’ writing in business genres. The study indicates that overall, the students achieved a level of genre knowledge that allowed expert members of their target community of practice to recognise them as writing professionally despite some shortfall between the ability of the students and the level they were expected to achieve. The diversity in the professionals’ responses to the discursive construction of professional identities by the Business English students suggests that there does not seem to be a monolithic international business professional identity; rather, it is likely to vary across contexts.

This study has important pedagogical implications for Business English education. One is that Business English education as was experienced by the Business English students in this study can promote transferrable skills in the form of genre knowledge and hence may narrow the gap between the academy and the workplace. Another is that specificity should be treated as an important principle in the teaching of Business English. Genre flexibility has been recognised in research (e. g. Devitt, 2004; Hyland, 2011; Schryer, 1993, 2011). As each instance of human interaction is situated (Dias et al., 1999) with reference to time, place, role-relationship, and activity (Gu, 2002), the interaction must be handled in a specific manner. General principles of business communication or human interaction as discussed in pragmatics need to take into account the specifics of the interaction in question, for example, the role relationships, tasks, and industry-specific practices or concerns.

The third pedagogical implication is that business genres need to be taught in a holistic way. This study indicates that the production of a professionally recognisable text requires enacting the relevant professional role by displaying the formal, process, rhetorical, and subject-matter dimensions of genre knowledge. This insight may be translated into a few guidelines for teaching business writing. Business writing should be treated from the outset as performing a business activity where the four dimensions of genre knowledge are equally relevant and important. This would involve initially discussing with students the activity-specific business matter to be handled. The discussion should also include the purpose or goal of the activity and the roles and relationships that are involved since business discourse is goal-oriented (Bargiela-Chiappini et al., 2007). When the processes of text production, distribution, and reception are discussed, they should be specified with an eye to real professional practices. Linguistic features and textual organisation need to be treated both as essential aspects of language learning and with reference to the linguistic realisation of the process, rhetorical, and subject-matter dimensions of genre knowledge. Encouraging students to adopt an approach in which they view themselves as researchers (Johns, 1997) may provide the opportunity for them to develop the awareness and strategies (in relation to the process and rhetorical dimensions of genre knowledge) they require in order to be able to manage unfamiliar situations.
