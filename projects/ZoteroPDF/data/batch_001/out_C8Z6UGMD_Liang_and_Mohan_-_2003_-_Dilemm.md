# Abstract

This study examines cooperative learning in relation to goals for L2 development, L1 maintenance, and content learning. It investigates how Chinese immigrant students perceive these goals, and how they use L1 and L2 to acquire content knowledge during cooperative learning activities. An analysis of interviews with the students indicates that they had contradictory feelings about cooperative learning goals, in particular the goals of L1 maintenance and L2 development. A functional analysis of the students’ interaction during cooperative learning sessions reveals differences between the L1 and L2 discourse they produced. Taken together, these findings indicate that the ideal goals that are claimed for cooperative learning may involve dilemmas between L1 maintenance and L2 development, between the use of L1 and L2 in academic discourse, and between the use of the L1 and L2 for the learning of content. Bilingual academic language proficiency is also shown to be a complex matter, involving the translation of meaning systems, not just labels.

# 1. Introduction

Cooperative learning refers to the instructional use of small groups in which students work together to accomplish meaningful school tasks (Johnson, Johnson, & Holubec 1994a, 1994b; Kagan, 1992; Sharan, 1990; Slavin, 1995). Research in the second language (L2) classroom indicates that cooperative learning is potentially beneficial for second language learners in a number of ways. It can provide more opportunities for L2 interaction and help improve L2 proficiency (Bejarano, 1987; Deen, 1987;

Doughty & Pica, 1986; Klingner & Vaughn, 2000; Pica, 1987; Pica & Doughty, 1985a, 1985b; Porto, 2001; Sharan, Bejarano, Kussell, & Peleg, 1984; Swain, 2001). It can help students draw on their first language (L1) while developing L2 skills (Cohen, 1986; Deen, 1987; Dı´az, Moll, & Mehan, 1986; Klingner & Vaughn, 2000; McGroarty, 1989, 1992; Neves, 1983; Wong-Fillmore, Ammon, McLaughlin, & Ammon, 1985). It can also include opportunities for the integration of language and content learning (McGroarty, 1989, 1992). (For a detailed literature review on cooperative learning in second language education, see Liang, Mohan, & Early, 1998.)

While the reported beneficial effects of cooperative learning in the second language classroom are impressive, little has been said about the multiple simultaneous goals of this important educational practice. How do the three cooperative learning goals of L2 development, L1 maintenance, and content learning interconnect? In other words, how do L2 students achieve a balance between L2 development and L1 maintenance, and how do they manage content learning in L2 and in L1? In addition, is the link between the development of academic language proficiency and content learning a straightforward matter of transfer, or a much more complex process? The purpose of this study was to address these questions. Specifically, it aimed at investigating how recently arrived Chinese immigrant students from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China perceived the three cooperative learning goals, and how they used L1 and L2 and acquired content knowledge during cooperative learning activities.

# 2. Theoretical background

This study draws on three sets of theoretical approaches. One is Cummins’ (1991a, 1992) bilingual proficiency theory, which may be used as a possible theoretical explanation of how the process of achieving the three goals of cooperative learning for L2 learners can work. Cummins (1991b, 2000) distinguished between conversational language proficiency and academic language proficiency. He described academic language as context reduced and cognitively demanding, and conversational language as context embedded and cognitively undemanding. He (1991a) also proposed that L1 and L2 context-reduced, cognitively demanding proficiencies are manifestations of a common underlying proficiency and are interdependent. This common underlying proficiency makes it possible for cognitive/academic skills (for example, conceptual knowledge, subject matter knowledge, higher-order thinking skills, reading strategies, and writing composition skills) to transfer between any two languages.

Based on his conceptualization of the relationships between L1 and L2 proficiency, Cummins (1993, 1994, 1995) strongly proposed that schools should play a role in supporting the continued development of L2 learners’ L1 academic language proficiency to stimulate transfer to L2. According to Cummins, content knowledge developed in L1 transfers or becomes available to L2. In this case, L2 learners need only to learn labels in L2. He considered the development of L2 learners’ L1 academic language proficiency as positively related to the acquisition of the L2 and the learning of content knowledge. Cummins’ bilingual proficiency model is a notable achievement which argues that, contrary to conventional wisdom, L1 maintenance does not necessarily detract from L2 development. However, the model has not been related to any tradition of discourse analysis, ultimately necessary for the study of academic language proficiency. In this article the use of functional analysis opens up a productive dialogue with the model.

The second theoretical approach this study draws on is Halliday’s (1985, 1994) functional view of language. Halliday regards language primarily as a resource that people use to make meaning. His functional view is concerned with ‘how people use language with each other in accomplishing everyday social life’ (Eggins, 1994: 2). This interest in language use, as Eggins sees it, leads Hallidayan functional linguists to advance four major theoretical claims about language: ‘that language use is functional; that its function is to make meaning; that these meanings are influenced by the social and cultural context in which they are exchanged; and that the process of using language is a semiotic process, a process of making meaning by choosing (p. 2, emphasis in original).

The Hallidayan functional view of language draws attention to important issues concerning the role of language as a medium of learning in cooperative activities and the functions that this use of language displays. In his early work, Halliday (1973) highlighted two language functions. The ideational language function is concerned with the content of language; its function is to express ‘our experience, both of the external world and of the inner world of our own consciousness—together with what is perhaps a separate subcomponent expressing certain basic logical relationships’ (p. 66). The interpersonal language function refers to the non-ideational elements in language use. It is ‘language as the mediator of role, including all that may be understood by the expression of our own personalities and personal feelings on the one hand, and forms of interaction and social interplay with other participants in the communication situation on the other hand’ (p. 66).

Building on a body of quantitative analysis of L1 discourse stimulated by Halliday’s early work, Staab (1986) provided a detailed coding for these language functions. She examined small group discussions by native English speaking students in elementary school classrooms to assess the quality of their academic thinking and discourse. The present study extends the technique to high school L1 and L2 discourse. The analysis of Halliday’s ideational and interpersonal language functions can throw light on Cummins’ (1991b, 2000) ideas about academic language proficiency. The two language functions provide broad categories for analyzing L1 and L2 discourse generated during cooperative learning activities, and allow us to make basic quantitative comparisons between L1 and L2.

This study is also inspired by Halliday’s (1998) later work on ideational meaning in discourse, particularly with respect to taxonomies or classifications in discourse. Halliday notes how all languages create taxonomies, most obviously in their vocabulary. A lexical item like ‘bird’ creates a class or category that is in contrast with others like ‘reptile’ or ‘fish’. The lexis also allows us to create classes of classes (taxonomies): crows and ravens are all classes of bird (p. 197). Such commonsense taxonomies are often reworked and replaced by scientific classifications as part of the processes of formal education. We may similarly expect the discussion of classes and taxonomies to arise in cooperative learning discussion. For the second language learner who has been educated in the first language and is now receiving education in the second, these matters are correspondingly more complex. The analyst of cooperative learning discussion must be alert to possible interactions not only between commonsense and scientific taxonomies in the L1 but also commonsense and scientific taxonomies in the L2.

The third theoretical approach this study draws on is Billig, Condor, Edwards, Gane, Middleton, and Radley’s (1988) theory of ideological dilemmas. According to Billig and his associates, ‘ordinary people do not necessarily have simple views about their social worlds and about their places in these worlds. Instead, their thinking is frequently characterized by the presence of opposing themes’ (p. 143). What is more, the dilemmatic aspects ‘do not only concern contrary ways of talking about the world; they exist in practice as well as in discourse. Above all, the dilemmatic aspects can give rise to actual dilemmas in which choices have to be made’ (p. 144). Often, choices are difficult to make, not so much because the alternatives appear equally unfavorable, but because ‘either way, the dilemma still remains a dilemma’ (p. 9).

In a study of the departmental colloquium in higher education institutions, for example, Tracy (1997) explored the web of problems academic groups face, the discursive practices used, and the ideals academics have about how they should talk. Her findings demonstrate that the academic colloquium is a dilemmatic situation involving multiple dilemmas. Although the cooperative learning research literature has investigated the process and the benefits of achieving learning goals, it has not attempted to address the multiple nature of these goals, and any ensuing dilemmas. It has not discussed whether it is possible for L2 students to achieve the goals all at once, and all of the time.

This study aims to uncover important and complex relations between the multiple simultaneous goals of cooperative learning. The specific research question is: what are the dilemmas, if any, that Chinese immigrant students encounter in their experiences of cooperative learning in ESL classes regarding the goals of developing academic language proficiency in L2, maintaining L1, and acquiring content knowledge?

# 3. Methods

This study was part of a larger research project (Liang, 1998) which explored cooperative learning as an intercultural social practice and as a potentially dilemmatic situation, in which Chinese students might have multiple and conflicting conceptions and goals, might confront unsatisfactory choices, and might need to make difficult decisions. The purpose was not to discount the value of cooperative learning but to explore the complexity of this educational practice in an ESL context.

# 3.1. The research site and participants

The study was conducted in Johnson Secondary School (a pseudonym) on the west side of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The school was chosen as the research site for three important reasons. Number one, it had an ESL program with a high percentage of Chinese speakers. Number two, the ESL program included a number of content based courses such as ESL Science, ESL Social Studies, and ESL Home Economics, in which students were learning the English language and subject matter simultaneously. Number three, the ESL program at Johnson used cooperative learning as one of its instructional strategies.

At the time of the study, the school had nine classes of recent immigrant ESL students, of whom many came from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and a few from China. The nine ESL classes were not grouped according to language proficiency, but on a multi-level basis instead. In this multi-level grouping, students were randomly assigned to ESL courses. The classes, therefore, had a wide range of language abilities and ages. The ESL department of Johnson Secondary believed that such multi-level groupings enabled a cooperative learning environment where less advanced students did not feel defeated by not being placed in a less progressive situation, and more advanced students gained enrichment by helping less advanced students. Students in these classes sat in groups of four, with four small desks clustered together. Groups changed each month, or when they started a new project.

The student participants of this study were selected according to three criteria. First, they were Chinese immigrant students who had been in Canada for no more than 3 years so that their past educational experience was still freshly remembered and their present educational experience was still very new. Second, they were taking at least one ESL course in the school ESL program. Third, they were of different ages and genders, in different grades, and had different English proficiency levels.

# 3.2. Data collection and analysis

The study employed two research methods for data collection. It used interviews to gather the students’ opinions about cooperative learning goals. Altogether, 49 participants were interviewed individually and were asked the same set of preestablished questions in the same order to reduce possible interviewer effects and bias. The interviewees were given the choice of responding in either Mandarin, Cantonese, or English so that they could express themselves freely in whichever language they felt comfortable with. Each interview lasted about $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ and was recorded with a cassette recorder. Of the 49 interviewees, 28 $( 5 7 \% )$ were male and 21 $(4 3 \% )$ were female. Their age ranged from 13 to 18 years, with an average of 15. Twenty-seven interviewees $( 5 5 \% )$ had been in Canada for less than a year, 19 $( 3 9 \% )$ for less than 2 years, and three $( 6 \% )$ for less than 3 years. Thirty interviewees $( 6 1 \% )$ spoke Mandarin at home and 19 $( 3 9 \% )$ spoke Cantonese at home.

Observations in natural classroom settings were also conducted to find out how the students undertook cooperative learning. At the initial stage, all 180 students from the nine ESL classes were observed, including those from countries or places other than Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. At the final stage, the focus was on the 120 or so Chinese immigrant students. Altogether, $1 2 0 \ \mathrm { h }$ of observations were carried out. Thirty hours of audiotapes were used to record the Chinese immigrant students’ spontaneous conversations during group activities. Some examples of academic tasks these students performed during group activities in the ESL classes are given in the appendix. Many related to the academic tasks students had to perform in the mainstream classes.

The interview data were analyzed using the inductive analysis strategy (McMillan & Schumacher, 1993). Methodologically, the audiotapes of interviews were transcribed in their entirety for analysis. The interviewees’ reasons for using their L1 during cooperative group activities were categorized by constant comparison to determine their representativeness.

The discourse data obtained through classroom observations were analyzed using Halliday’s (1973) interpersonal and ideational language functions as broad categories, and Staab’s (1986) four language functions of social needs, controlling, informing, and reasoning as further elaborations (Table 1). Within ideational functions, the analysis focused particularly on reasoning as high-level academic discourse. The analysis of ideational language function can throw light on Cummins’ (1991b, 2000) discussion of academic language proficiency. As Cummins did not define conversational and academic language in terms of discourse analysis, this study did not use these two language types as analytical categories.

Methodologically, the L1 and L2 utterances were coded according to their function as ‘social needs’, ‘controlling’, ‘informing’, or ‘reasoning’. Informing and reasoning utterances were then examined to determine the role of English and of Chinese. Subsequently, $1 0 \%$ of the L1 and L2 code-switching discourse data was coded by two other experienced coders independently, and the interrater reliability was found to be 0.83.

# 4. Findings

This study addresses the issue of whether all three goals claimed for cooperative learning in second language education can be achieved simultaneously all of the time. The findings of the study seem to present a complex picture of cooperative learning in the ESL classroom.

# 4.1. Attitudes to L1 and L2 use

The interview results show that the Chinese immigrant students had conflicting feelings about use of L1 and L2 during group work. All 49 students stated that they sometimes spoke their L1 in ESL classes. They gave their reasons for doing so. However, at different times during the interviews, the Chinese students expressed their wish to speak more English and not to speak Chinese at all in ESL classes.

# 4.1.1. Reasons for using L1

A major reason for Chinese students’ use of their L1 in the ESL classroom seemed to be for speed and convenience. Thirty students responded that it was easier, faster, and more convenient to get meanings across through the bridge of their native tongue. A related reason students gave for their use of Chinese was that they did not know enough English. Twelve students felt that they did not have enough vocabulary to explain or express themselves clearly in English without causing some confusion and misunderstanding. A third reason for the Chinese students’ use of their L1 was that they were accustomed to speaking Chinese to each other. Fifteen students said that they felt strange, unnatural, awkward, or uncomfortable speaking English to their group members whose mother tongue was the same as theirs. Peer pressure was another reason Chinese students gave for their use of Chinese in ESL classes. Seven students explained that they spoke Chinese because everybody else in the group did. They did not want to be different.

# 4.1.2. The desire to speak more L2

At different times during the interviews, students indicated that they wanted to speak more English in class. They did not want to speak Chinese. When asked what suggestions they would give to new ESL students, many Chinese students made comments that reflected their own wish to speak more English and not to speak their L1 in ESL classes. Many students in this study expressed conflicts of one kind or another regarding the use of L1 and L2. Whereas all 49 students said that they tended to speak Chinese during group work in ESL classes, 23 $( 4 7 \% )$ recommended speaking more English, and 9 $( 1 8 \% )$ recommended not speaking Chinese. Taking these two recommendations together, 27 of the 49 students $( 5 5 \% )$ recommended one and/or the other. These 49 Chinese students ranged from age 13 to 18, and their contradictory feelings about speaking English and Chinese during cooperative activities in ESL classes did not appear to be representative of any particular age group.

# 4.2. Differences in the functional use of L1 and L2

Observation data obtained through audio recording show that the Chinese students talked a great deal in both L1 and L2 when working in groups during ESL classes, and switched between English and Chinese freely and frequently. An analysis of intersentential (that is, between sentences) rather than intrasentential (that is, within sentences) switching between the two languages suggests that there were differences in the functions of their L1 and L2 discourse. Their L2 was used much more for ideational functions than for interpersonal functions, while interpersonal and ideational function were more evenly balanced in the L1 (see Table 2). Tables 2 and 3 show language functions compared by number of words rather than utterances, since utterance length varied greatly in this data across functions and across languages.

Table 2 L1 & L2 Use in relation to interpersonal & ideational language functions   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Interpersonal</td><td colspan="2">Ideational</td><td colspan="2">Total</td></tr><tr><td>L1</td><td>1075</td><td>45%</td><td>1291</td><td>55%</td><td>2366</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>L2</td><td>361</td><td>18%</td><td>1665</td><td>82%</td><td>2026</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></body></html>

However, a closer examination of ideational functions revealed that while both L1 and L2 were used more for informing (that is, low level academic language) than for reasoning (that is, high level academic language), L1 discourse was used more for reasoning than L2 discourse (see Table 3).

Table 3 L1 & L2 Use in relation to informing & reasoning language functions

# 4.2.1. The use of L1 ideational discourse

A detailed examination of L1 and L2 use for ideational functions demonstrates a qualitative difference: that L1 was used for ideational functions connected with longterm goals such as to learn the English language and to learn content knowledge whereas ideational L2 use was more for temporary and immediate action. The students used their L1 to work out the English equivalents of Chinese words or the

Chinese equivalents of English words (as in Excerpt 1), particularly when there were different opinions, or when they did not know exact equivalents. They also switched to their L1 to work out conceptual meanings of English words and phrases that they did not know or were not sure of (as in Excerpt 2). In addition, students used L1 to work out the spelling of English words (as in Excerpt 3). In these and the subsequent excerpts, numbers on the left stand for individual students. Italics stand for utterances made by the participants in either Mandarin or Cantonese. Words in brackets were inserted by the researchers to avoid ambiguity.

Excerpt 1:   
S4: How do you say ability?   
S5: It’s ability, ability.   
S4: Yah, but how do you say that everyone had his unique ability? S5: Strange ability?   
S4: Everyone had his ability.   
S6: Special.   
S4: Yah. Every single one had his own special ability.   
S7: Unique, unique ability.   
S4: Unique ability.   
S5: Unique? Okay. Unique. Excerpt 2:   
S8: Does ‘discovery’ mean the person who discovers? S9: Discovery, discovery is, discoverer   
S8: Is the person.   
S9: Is the person. Discovery is not the person.   
S8: New discovery?   
S9: Yeah. Excerpt 3:   
S1: How do you say sugarcane?   
S2: Sugarcane?   
S1: Sugar, [pausing] sugarcane, oh!   
S3: How do you spell it? S, u, g, a, r, c, a, n? S1: I write c, a, n, e. I think there should be an e.

Besides using their L1 to help themselves learn the L2, the students also used their L1 to help themselves learn content knowledge. They were observed switching to Chinese to work out task requirements (as in Excerpt 4) and content answers (as in Excerpts 5 and 6).

Excerpt 4:   
S1: What other fruits? How many did the teacher say we need to write? S2: Twenty-five.   
S3: The rest we can write vegetables. Excerpt 5:   
S2: Tofu. Tofu.   
S3: Tofu, t, o, f, u.   
S2: Beans, b, e, a, n, s.   
S1: These [tofu and beans] belong to this [meat] category?   
S2: Yes.   
S1: But it says meat here.   
S3: If you turn to the other side [of the worksheet], you might not find it there [in the vegetables and fruit groups].   
S1: What do you mean?   
S3: I mean the two categories [meat and bean products] are put together here [in the meat group]. Tofu might belong to this category.   
S2: Yes, that’s right.   
S1: But this group is for meat.   
S2: It should be okay.   
Excerpt 6:   
S3: What other meat?   
S2: How about seafood?   
S3: Seafood?   
S2: Sea lobster.   
S3: What else?   
S1: Starfish. Starfish.   
S2: Not edible.   
S1: Hey, write frog. Write frog. What about snake? Snakes are edible.

# 4.2.2. The use of L2 ideational discourse

While L1 was used for ideational functions connected with long-term effects, L2 was used for ideational functions that were for immediate actions. When L2 was used for reasoning, it tended to be for explaining content learned only in L2, not in L1. It appeared that a limited use of L2 for reasoning occurred particularly when content was learned through English in ESL classes. The students were observed speaking English when they tried to get immediate and concrete tasks completed in class, for instance, to memorize questions and answers for tests (as in Excerpt 7), and to write answers to questions for assignments (as in Excerpt 8).

Excerpt 7:   
S13: So chlorine probably is a non-metal, right? Chlorine, chlorine. S14: Non-metal.   
S13: So carbon is a metal or a non-metal? Carbon.   
S14: Non-metal.   
S13: So, chlorine, non-metal or?   
S14: Non-metal.   
S13: Yah. So, oxygen is?   
S14: Non-metal. Excerpt 8:   
S19: Er, next sentence. [Writing] A hydrogen, molecule, a hydrogen molecule S20: Is   
S19: [Writing] Is made of   
S20: Is made of two hydrogen, made of two hydrogen atoms.   
S19: [Writing] Is made of two hydrogen, atoms.   
S20: Yeah. Okay. That’s it.

4.2.2.1. Using L2 for reasoning about content learned only in L2. When Chinese students’ L2 discourse did occur in reasoning function, it appeared that it was particularly used for content learned through English in ESL classes. That is to say, students had not learned the content information back in their home country. They did not have prior knowledge about the subject matter in their L1. In Excerpt 9, Student 22 was in Grade 8 and had apparently not learned about magnesium before. The concept of magnesium was learned in the ESL Science class at Johnson Secondary School. In explaining to his group members how he did the question on magnesium, he started in Chinese, but switched to English after only one word.

Excerpt 9:   
S21: [To S22, referring to the question: Explain why magnesium has no overall charge.] Hey, how did you do question 3?   
S22: Ah?   
S21: How did you do question 3?   
S22: Because sodium ion has plus one, and chlorine ion has minus one. So, plus one and minus one equals zero. So there’s no overall charge.   
S21: Mm hmm.

To summarize the findings, the interview data show that the Chinese immigrant students in the present study had contradictory feelings about cooperative learning goals. They made ample use of their first language during group work in ESL classes. Yet, almost simultaneously, they expressed their wish not to speak their first language. They wanted to speak more English in class. The observation data demonstrated that these feelings were not without basis. There were differences in the functions of Chinese students’ L1 and L2 discourse produced in groups. In addition, while their L1 discourse was often used for long term goals to help learning L2 and content knowledge, their L2 discourse was often used for short term action such as answers to tests and also for content only learned in L2.

# 5. Discussion

Second language education literature describes cooperative learning as providing second language learners with more opportunities for L2 development, L1 maintenance, and content acquisition. Cummins’ (1991a, 1992) bilingual proficiency theory suggests that second language students can acquire content knowledge and develop L2 proficiency through the use of L1. Thus, cooperative learning appears to offer a solution to many problems of second language education. However, cooperative learning goals seen from the Chinese immigrant students’ standpoint reveal quite a different picture. The findings of this study seem to indicate that the set of ideal goals claimed for cooperative learning may in fact be a complex knot of dilemmas for the Chinese immigrant students. The dilemmatic nature of cooperative learning goals was expressed in terms of three sets of dilemmas through interview and observation data.

# 5.1. Dilemmas of L1 maintenance vs. L2 development

The first set of dilemmas of cooperative learning goals centered on the balance between L1 maintenance and L2 development. Chinese students made much use of L1 during group work. The analysis suggests that the Chinese language was, in many cases, used to help students learn the English language. Nonetheless, the Chinese students did not appear very happy about speaking Chinese to each other during group work. They seemed to want to speak more English. Why? Learners’ reluctance to use their L1 should be of major concern to anyone interested in L1 maintenance.

Three factors suggest themselves. First, Chinese students’ mixed feelings about L1 and L2 use could be due to the tremendous pressure to learn English to the level required at university. If they chose to speak Chinese in class, they would have less time to speak English. If they decided to speak more English, they would have fewer opportunities to speak Chinese. How could they balance the two goals? Second, the students’ mixed feelings about the L1 and L2 use may be a result of parental pressure. Most of the Chinese students interviewed in this study reported that their parents wanted them to move out of the ESL program as soon as possible. It may be speculated that the Chinese students wanted to learn English fast to satisfy their parents’ expectations. Third, Chinese students’ contradictory feelings about L1 and L2 use appeared to relate to peer pressure for personal identity and group membership. They wanted to move into mainstream classes and the bigger English-speaking community. They saw English as the only way to achieve that. On the other hand, they did not want to be excluded from their peer groups. They wanted to be part of the Chinese-speaking community.

Cummins (1991a, 1992) bilingual proficiency model does not include the possibility of dilemmatic attitudes to the use of the L1 and the L2. However, the evidence above suggests that these attitudes need to be accounted for.

# 5.2. Dilemmas concerning language choice in academic discourse

The second set of dilemmas of cooperative learning goals revolved around the use of L1 for academic discourse and developing academic discourse in L2. The Chinese students were supposed to develop L2 academic discourse for school purposes, but they were also under time pressure to complete the group task in class. If they wanted to get the work done quickly, then they would not want to lose time discussing in L2. But if they talked through their understandings in L1, which was considered faster and easier by many of them, then what would happen to the development of their ability to talk through their understandings in L2?

The development of academic discourse in the L1 versus the L2 is not elaborated in Cummins’ (1991a, 1992) model, which targets the underlying proficiency common to both L1 and L2 rather than the distinction between L1 and L2. Yet it is the choice between academic discourse in the L1 and academic discourse in the L2 which is dilemmatic for these students.

# 5.3. Dilemmas concerning content learning

The third set of dilemmas related to content learning in L1 and content learning in L2. Two points can be made in relation to our findings. The first point is that if content learned in L2 is dealt with in L2 and not discussed and shared in L1, it is difficult for L2 students to simultaneously develop academic discourse in both languages. Excerpt 9 shows that Student 22 shared his answer for the question on magnesium with his group members in English. He started in Chinese, but, after only one word, switched to English and completed his explanation in English. This suggests that he learned the concept of magnesium in English and found it easier to explain in L2 rather than in L1. In terms of Cummins’ bilingual proficiency model, this suggests that transfer from one language into another may not flow freely, and particularly that a speaker may not find it easy to discuss technical content in one language if it has been learned in another. In Excerpt 9, the student uses magnesium, sodium, chlorine, ion, and charge, which are technical terms based on scientific taxonomies in English. It may well be that the student cannot access the equivalent technical terms in Chinese.

The second point concerns the extent to which content learned in L1 can be simply transferred to L2. Cummins’ model assumes that it can, but our findings suggest that student prior knowledge in L1 may be in tension with content knowledge learned in L2. The classification task shown in Excerpt 6, for example, raises the question of whether ‘meat’ should be considered in terms of what the students ate in their home country in the past, or what they eat in the present, in Canada. The classification examples show how transfer cannot simply be a matter of translation of labels. Scientific classifications are part of academic knowledge, just as ‘commonsense’ classifications are part of cultural knowledge, and both are systems of meaning realized in a given language. We argue that any transfer model should recognize the existence of classifications and other systems of meaning and deal with the problems of their reconstruction.

# 6. Implications

To summarize the discussion above, firstly, it needs to be recognized that there may be potential conflicts between cooperative learning goals that generate dilemmas for L2 learners. The Chinese immigrant students in this study had difficult choices to make between these goals. Whichever decisions they made, they could not escape dilemmas. Secondly, Cummins’ (1991a, 1992) bilingual proficiency model provides a possible explanation of how the three cooperative learning goals are related, but should be developed to account for the socioeducational complexity of students’ L1 and L2 use during cooperative learning activities, and the various conflicts and dilemmas involved in the three cooperative learning goals.

# 6.1. Implications for further research

While the findings of prior research into cooperative learning outcomes are impressive, we need to consider not only the benefits of cooperative learning but also the conflicts in students’ opinions and interactions. Cooperative learning can involve conflicting views and discourses. Individual L2 students may simultaneously hold multiple and contradictory ideas about cooperative learning and may simultaneously generate multiple and conflicting discourses during cooperative learning tasks. By stressing its dilemmatic nature, the present study is able to see cooperative learning as frequently a form of debate among and within individual students. Researchers should aim to recognize L2 students’ conflicting interpretations and agendas for cooperative learning and articulate more fully the cooperative learning dilemmas that second language students experience but may be unable to express.

To address the complexity of these dilemmas, researchers will have to expand on Cummins’ (1991a, 1992) bilingual proficiency model to recognize dilemmatic attitudes to the use of the L1 and the L2, difficult choices in the use of L1 and L2 for academic purposes at different points in the processes of academic tasks, factors which may limit the learner’s recourse to explanation in the L1, and a richer notion of transfer which can address the fact that transfer is not simply a matter of relabelling, but involves relating classifications and other systems of meaning across languages and cultures.

# 6.2. Implications for teachers

Cooperative learning as a classroom activity inevitably reflects differences in educational cultures. In situations where students come from different educational and cultural backgrounds, cooperative learning may not always be well appreciated. There is a possibility of a clash of educational cultures. Students may in part accept the North American educational culture and in part cling to their deeply held values and beliefs. They may understand cooperative learning in the context of the educational culture they are used to, and agree with some of the cooperative learning features, but disagree with others.

Teachers may wish to explore how cooperative learning can be a matter of dilemmas for second language learners, and how dilemmas can arise from conflicts of social and cultural values. If teachers are not sensitive to the presence of dilemmas and the conflicts and tensions involved, second language students’ learning in small groups may be impeded. Teachers may assign second language students to work in groups with all the ideal goals of cooperative learning in mind, while second language students may interpret the group activities in a culturally divergent way that may in fact subvert the goals teachers have. This cultural context of cooperative learning needs to be recognized and acknowledged.
