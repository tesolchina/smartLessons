# Abstract

This article explores how collocation relates to lexical technicality, and how the relationship can be exploited for teaching EAP to second-year engineering students. First, corpus data are presented to show that complex noun phrase formation is a ubiquitous feature of engineering text, and that these phrases (or collocations) are highly discipline-specific in a way that individual words are not. Next it is shown that these collocations as a class may be seen as a kind of threshold to specialised engineering discourse at the undergraduate level, and as such can be used as a basis for an EAP reading programme which is appropriate both in terms of difficulty and specialisation.

# 1. Introduction

Engineering students in third world countries are often required to read textbooks in English, mainly because of the paucity of materials in their first language. The technical and linguistic difficulties which these students face have been well documented over the years (e.g., Anwar, 1994; Brown, 1988; Cohen, Glasman, Rosenbaum-Cohen, Ferrara, & Fine, 1988; Cooper, 1984; Dharmapriya, 1988; Dlaska, 1999; Flowerdew, 1993; Hassan, Neilson, & Thomas, 1986). The lexical aspect of the EAP problem has been treated by writers such as Laufer (Laufer, 1991; Laufer & Sim, 1985) and Nation (Nation & Hwang, 1995; Nation & Waring, 1997), and solutions in the form of engineering wordlists have been discussed by , for example, Ward (1999). All these writers share the notion that, with lexis being a primary problem for learners, a wordlist of a certain length (varying from 2000 to 5000 words, according to the writer) can be the basis for a lexical EAP syllabus.

Since the aim of these programmes is to promote better reading, it makes sense to embed such a lexical syllabus in a programme of reading texts (some difficulties of which are explored in Worthington & Nation, 1996). This raises the problem of providing textual material which reflects the textbooks students are being prepared to read, but which is technically easy enough for them, and the language teacher, to handle. One common answer to this is to use popular science texts, on the grounds that such texts generate general and sub-technical (or academic) lexis, as well as organisational features, that also occur in the more specialist textbook. This risks patronising and/or boring students. What would be preferable would be something that relates directly to their field of study. This paper tries to provide this, while relating the problem to the topic of collocation.

# 2. Collocation is ubiquitous

Engineering students normally study background engineering topics (fluid mechanics, engineering materials, among others) for about a year before moving into their specialist disciplines (e.g., chemical or electrical engineering). This study looks at the lexical characteristics of undergraduate textbook material in one of these disciplines, chemical engineering, and incidentally compares it with that of four other disciplines, civil, electrical, industrial and mechanical engineering. Two corpora are used: corpus 1 is derived from large extracts from three chemical engineering textbooks and accounts for about 380,000 tokens (running words); corpus 2 is derived from five engineering disciplines (those mentioned) and accounts for about 250,000 words. For corpus 2, five textbooks were chosen in each discipline and a random sample of 10,000 words was taken from each book. Corpus 2 overall is thus based on $2 5 \times 1 0 { , } 0 0 0$ -word samples.

The five textbooks for the chemical engineering subcorpus cover eight of the thirteen courses offered to chemical engineering undergraduates at the author’s institution (some books cover two courses, e.g., Plant Design 1 and Plant Design 2). They thus represent a reasonable though not comprehensive range of the undergraduate discipline. Between 50 and 100 pages from each book were randomly selected for word counting.

One thing that soon became apparent from the multi-disciplinary corpus 2 was the divergence in the most common lexis (especially nouns) in the different disciplines. There is not sufficient space to discuss this phenomenon here, which casts into some doubt the notion of a common engineering vocabulary, but it led to a closer examination of the numerous discipline-specific words. At first, three were chosen randomly from the top of the chemical engineering frequency list—gas, heat, and liquid. These words occur with the following frequencies in the different disciplines of corpus 2 (Table 1).

Table 1 Distribution of three words across corpus 2

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Gas</td><td>1089</td><td>78</td><td>4/19/55</td><td>727</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Heat</td><td>846</td><td>35</td><td>1/12/22</td><td>540</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Liquid</td><td>835</td><td>45</td><td>1/8/36</td><td>476</td><td>57</td></tr></table></body></html>

The columns show frequency of occurrence in the five different disciplines, and the total across the corpus. The words are not completely confined to individual disciplines, and the corpus is a small one, but the phenomenon of disciplinary specialisation is obviously marked.

In terms of breadth of vocabulary knowledge, each of these words is of course one item in a long list. But when we investigate what it is learners need to know about these words— depth of knowledge—we find the most salient feature is their collocational behaviour. More often than not, these words enter into complex noun phrases with other nouns (one, two or three) or, sometimes, with adjectives. Before we look at this in a little more detail, we should point out that a broad, functional definition of adjective is adopted here, to include participles such as entering (entering gas) and saturated (saturated gas). Such phrases do not in fact account for much of the data, as can be seen in the list in Appendix A. The reader should also note that we have not included noun phrases which contain any function words.

For investigating collocational behaviour we began with corpus 1, as it is considerably larger than corpus 2. The Concordance tool in Wordsmith version 2 (now updated to version 4 and easily found for purchase on the Web) was used to identify collocations of all the most common nouns in the chemical engineering corpora.

In corpus 1 gas occurs 1089 times (a similar proportion to that in corpus 2). If we include only those noun phrases1 occurring three times or more, there are 78 noun phrase collocations. Of these 78, four contain four words, 19 three words, and 55 two words. These 78 account for 727 of the occurrences of gas in the corpus; this means that in $6 6 \%$ (727/1089) of cases, gas occurs with another word forming this type of complex noun phrase. These figures are shown in Table 2, together with the corresponding figures for heat and liquid.

The columns show the following:

A: Number of tokens (of single word concerned)   
B: Number of collocations (types)   
C: Number of $2 / 3 / 4$ -word collocations (types)   
D: Number of collocations (tokens)   
E: Percentage of tokens (collocations) as against tokens (single word).

Since all these collocations occur at least three times, they pass the test of recurrence to qualify as collocations (Moon, 1997, p. 44). What the figures suggest is that what the reader needs to know is not gas, but gas $^ +$ . But are these words typical? Table 3 suggests strongly that they are. The words on the left were chosen at random from most common nouns (frequency $> 1 0 0 \AA$ ) in corpus 1. The other columns show the corresponding information to columns B, D and E in Table 2.

It appears that the most common nouns in the corpus typically appear mostly in the type of noun phrase (or collocation) that we have been discussing. In fact it is more unusual for them to appear alone.

What this section has shown is that collocation, in the particular sense of two-, threeand four-content-word noun-phrases, is ubiquitous in chemical engineering textbooks and thus accounts for a large part of the word frequency data. This suggests that a lexical syllabus can usefully take account of this aspect of depth of lexical knowledge.

# 3. Collocation is specialised

The nouns we have examined so far are to a greater or lesser extent specialised in chemical engineering, so it is obvious that hardly any of their collocations appear in other sub-disciplines. In fact no more than three of all the collocation types with gas, heat and liquid appear in other sub-disciplines, and none with any frequency. A better way to demonstrate the centrality of collocation to specialisation is to show data from words that are common in more than one sub-discipline. Let us look at some nouns, common in corpus 1 and 2, which have flatter distributions across corpus 1, like those in the left-hand column of Table 4.

The PR figure in the right-hand column is the PEAKRATIO measure of distribution, which is obtained by dividing the maximum occurrence by the mean occurrence across the different corpus components (Yang, 1986). There are more sophisticated measures available involving standard deviations, such as Juilland’s D (see Oakes, 1998, p. 190), but the results of this latter measure correlate with PEAKRATIO at over .97 (Spearman’s $\rho$ ) for all frequencies, so we will stay with the simpler measure. Note that with a corpus of five components like corpus 2, words occurring in only one component will have a PR of 5.0, while those with a perfectly flat distribution would have a PR of 1.0 (the maximum occurrence would be equal to the mean occurrence.) As these words’ relatively low

PEAKRATIOS, shown in the right-hand column, indicate, they are well distributed over the five sub-disciplinary corpora.

Table 5 shows the distribution of these words’ collocations across corpus 2. The first column shows the word. The next column gives the number of NP collocations with a frequency greater than 4 (as corpus 2 contains fewer words, less frequent items are omitted to reduce chance occurrences). The two figures in this column are for left- and right-hand collocations respectively. The next column gives some examples of the collocates involved. The last column shows the mean PR figures (left- and right-hand again), i.e., the mean distribution of the collocations involved over five disciplines.

These generally high PR figures, indicating narrow distributions, were replicated with the collocations of five other typical (high frequency, high range) words: process, form, component, flow, and conditions.

# 4. Collocation and technicality

Language teachers sometimes have little knowledge of scientific and engineering fields and so cannot be expected to teach field-related vocabulary, even if the subject specialist teachers wanted them to. As Nation (2001, p. 204) says, ‘‘ylearning technical words is closely connected with learning the subjectyEnglish teachers are not usually well equipped to work with technical texts and the technical vocabulary they contain.’’ Similarly, Jordan (1997, p. 152) says, ‘‘ythe (technical) words are closely connected with learning the subject and may present conceptual difficulties.’’

One way to tackle this problem has been (essentially) to avoid it, by claiming that it is not the language teacher’s business. In this view, the student is assumed either to know the technical terms because he knows the subject (see e.g., Cobb & Horst, 2001, p. 315) or to be able to learn them directly from the specialist teacher (Cohen et al., 1988; Cowan, 1974, p. 391). In either case the EAP practitioner’s job is to identify technical vocabulary so that it can be excluded from the language syllabus. The practicalities of teaching are thus enlisted to support the decision to leave technical vocabulary alone.

The notion is reinforced by the idea that technical words ‘‘ycould provide coverage of up to $5 \%$ of the running words in a text’’ (Coxhead & Nation, 2001, p. 252), a small proportion when compared to the $1 0 \%$ comprised by ‘‘academic’’ vocabulary (see, e.g., Nation, 2001). It should be pointed out that in later collaborations, Nation and associates (exploring other ways of identifying technical vocabulary) put text coverage by technical words at $30 \%$ or more (Chung & Nation, 2003, 2004). There is no space here to discuss the arguments; we will note merely that they continue to treat single words only, in contrast to the collocational approach adopted here.

Consider the following definition of technical language, from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (2004):

Technical language is language that is difficult for most people to understand because it is connected with one particular subject or used in one particular job.

This suggests that there are two strands of meaning in the word technicality: specialisation and difficulty. Of course not all specialised words are inherently difficult, but the problems for the EAP teacher, described earlier in this section, may be assumed to arise from the factor of difficulty. Rather than the sort of quarantining of technical vocabulary suggested above, it may be more productive to consider what it is that makes technicality difficult. Among those who have attempted to do this, and whose work we will draw upon here, are Halliday (1985) and Pueyo and Val (1996).

# 4.1. Technicality as compression

Technicality arises as a result of the creation of new knowledge. The birth of technicality, technicalisation, is a process. One important aspect of this process is compression.

New knowledge must initially be formulated as propositions. Relativity was never new knowledge: the new knowledge was that observations depend on the relative motion of the observer and the observed object. $E = m c ^ { 2 }$ was not new knowledge: the new knowledge was that energy equals the product of the mass and the square of the speed of light. These propositions are then compressed. This is not a feature peculiar to technicalisation, but it is characteristic of it. The mechanics of the process of compression are described by Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik (1985, p. 1526). Their example is the word dieselization. To summarise their argument, new knowledge is stated as propositions (‘‘We may convert our railways from having steam-enginesy’’) to nominalisations (‘‘the use of dieselpowered engines’’), which in turn may come to appear clumsy and ‘‘undercommitted’’ and so are converted into single words (‘‘dieselization’’).

The process as described above, then, involves nominalisation of propositions, either by the formation of new nominal phrases, or by the creation of new single words (called lexicalisation by Quirk et al. (1985), or by the two processes in sequence (as in the example of dieselization). Technicalisation of this type is also explained in terms of grammatical metaphor. This phrase, coined by Halliday (1985), is explained as follows. The natural relationship is between processes or (as above) events on the one hand and verbs on the other; but the process of nominalisation allows the treatment of processes as nouns, which in turn allows both the attribution to them of properties and also their participation in other events.

Nominalizations are important in science because they allow complex phenomena to be summarized in a few words. However their main advantage is the ability they have to construct meaning and to build new knowledge upon previous knowledge. (Pueyo & Val, 1996, p. 257)

The reverse of the compression/lexicalization process, often called unpacking (e.g., Banks, 2005, p. 351), involves nominals (phrases or words) being expanded into the propositions from which they are derived. The attempt to unpack leads to the problem of what Quirk et al. (1985) call unrecoverability. We cannot recover the meaning of dieselization from its form: we may guess, but there is no way of being sure that it means what it does, rather than (say) lubricating railway lines with diesel oil. It is necessary to revert to the phrasal, or further, propositional equivalent of the word in order to disambiguate.

The point here is that, all other things being equal, the creation of new nominal phrases (and thus of new collocations) represents an easier stage of technicalisation than the creation of new words. Consider the following example. The term enthalpy is defined in the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary as:

The total heat content of a system, expressed as a thermodynamic quantity obtained by adding its free energy to the product of its pressure and volume.

This definition, this explanatory nominalisation, represents an unpacking of the term and must, logically, be easier than the word itself. But it contains three further nominal phrases which themselves require explanation. We are all used to dealing with the idea of heat, but what can total heat content be? Is it a temperature, a volume, or what? The answer to these questions is presumably contained in the phrase thermodynamic quantity, whatever that may be. Another difficulty is with free energy: a two-minute conversation with a chemical engineer failed to produce a definition which I was able to grasp with any certainty, and the dictionary definition, ‘‘ya thermodynamic property of a system that represents ability to do work,’’ is useless without understanding what thermodynamics is (or are). The point is that a word like enthalpy represents the culmination of the process of compression: compression of any number of propositions into noun phrases of increasing degrees of difficulty to the non-specialist. We cannot encapsulate any further the proposition—the idea—from which the word is derived (barring, of course, by abbreviation or by symbolic representation as in an equation).

We do not claim that there is a single, two-word phrase for enthalpy which is easier than the word itself. Neither do we claim that two- or three-word phrases are always easier than the single words contained in them (we find, e.g., partial molar enthalpy). But as a general principle, phrases represent an earlier and thus easier stage of technicalisation than single words, partly because the burden of unpacking and unrecoverability is smaller.

The data presented concerning compression accord with Quirk et al. (1985, p.1531), who speak of: ‘‘Scientific writing yhaving a distinctly higher proportion of noun phrases with complexity (and multiple complexity); y. and the weakest association of simple with subject and complex with non-subject.’’ (The authors’ ‘‘simple noun phrases’’ are single words.)

In terms of teaching, then, we can summarise by saying that dealing with collocations helps tackle the difficulty of technicality caused by compression. This is because they are less compressed (in the sense described) than single technical words and because we can unpack them into propositions, which is the original form of the new knowledge that they represent.

# 4.2. Technicality as precision

So far we have been talking about how technicality comes about through the naming of phenomena: the creation of nominal groups is seen as a natural product of this naming. The next aspect to be examined is precision.

Technical terms are those for which there is a congruity of concept between all scientists, whatever the language usedythe properties or characteristics can be enumerated to define the object in an unambiguous manner. (Selinker & Tarone, 1981, p. 24)

This relates to items collectively as well as individually: ‘‘y[e]ach term is dependent for a full appreciation of its meaning on the meaning of (the) other terms’’ (1981, p. 28). A similar point is made by Pueyo and Val (1996, p. 251): ‘‘ywhat makes written language so difficult is not the technical terms themselves but the complex relationships they establish with each other, that is, the ‘‘wording’’ as a whole.’’ Enthalpy in section 4.1 was a clear example of this. We saw that understanding the definition depended on knowing two other terms (free energy and heat content, which were themselves interrelated) and that both of these rested on the technical concept of thermodynamics. But the point also applies to seemingly simple words. Few people, one imagines, would confess to being baffled by the word gas; it is in a sense an ‘‘easy’’ word. If taxed for a definition, the layman might talk about states of matter, of solids and liquids; we are still in the realm of everyday experience. But it is doubtful whether the layman will produce anything like the chemical engineer’s a species at above boiling point as a definition. It is precisely because it depends on the two concepts species and boiling point: no doubt the reader will know what a boiling point is, but the assumption (made by myself) that species just means substance is mistaken. The difference between the two was difficult enough that it could not be made clear to me in a short conversation with a chemical engineer.

Gas, then, is basic and everyday, but in chemical engineering it is a) technical because it is precise, and b) precise because it is technical. If we look at the most common nouns in corpus 1, listed below, we see that they too are used in everyday language with meanings similar to those found in chemical engineering (with the exception of reactor).

reaction rate reactor system control equation temperature process time pressure gas concentration function heat liquid energy volume feed stream vapor

In a sense, then, these words are at the threshold of technicality. They are near the everyday experience of the student but are established as technical by their definition, which is precise and which relates them to other terms, in the same way as heat. And through this process of unpacking (defining) we create mini-texts at a low level of technicality—precisely what is needed for students at the beginning second-year stage of study. But there are strong arguments in favour of creating mini-texts based on the collocations that these words enter into rather than the words themselves. First, the collocations are more specialised and sub-disciplinary specific than the individual words themselves. This fact, which is of course a statistical necessity, may be something of a motivating factor for specialising students. Second, being more specialised, the collocations involve more specialised vocabulary when they are unpacked. Indeed, the next section will show that the mini-texts created are packed with relevant lexis. This vocabulary will be recycled many times in the definitional texts that are created. Third, by treating lexis at a level above that of the single word, we encourage better reading habits. By teaching students to process words in groups (noun groups of two, three or even four words) we take their reading to a higher level. This idea is based on long-accepted psycholinguistic research (see e.g., Perfetti, 1985).

# 4.2.1. Unpacking collocations

A chemical engineering professor was asked to write some short definitions of some collocations from corpus 1. The first example, natural gas, is shown below:

(Expert’s definition) natural gas: A gas for cooking, heating, and also used in some vehicles as a fuel (often stored in the liquid state). It is a fossil fuel which is in the gas phase. The main component is methane, but it also contains other light hydrocarbons as ethane, propane, and butane, and some contaminants, such as carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide.

I myself had written a ‘‘lay’’ definition of natural gas (the gas we cook with in UK, which comes via pipes into our kitchens from the gas mains) which stands in vivid contrast to the accuracy, detail and precision of the expert definition. Pedagogically, the point is that the expert definition gives us a text which is comprehensible to the layman teacher while being appropriate for the beginning chemical engineer—subject specific, perhaps slightly challenging for many, and not patronising.

Of the 25 content words in the expert definition of natural gas above, 18 occur more than 50 times in the $^ { 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 + }$ -word corpus 3 (a combinations of corpus 1, the chemical engineering component of corpus 2 and some other chemical engineering material). These 18 words (all except stored hydrocarbons contaminants cooking sulphide vehicles and fossil) thus would all occur on average a minimum of 10 times in a fairly short book of 100,000 words, or once every 10,000 words. They account for $1 . 4 \%$ of the entire corpus 3. We can thus claim that this text, the expert definition which unpacks the collocation, is packed with very frequent chemical engineering words. Perhaps it hardly needs pointing out that the text is also lexically highly specialised. Only five of the 25 content words in the expert definition (used phase state component main) occur at this frequency (once every 10,000 words) in the other engineering sub-disciplines of the corpus 1. Of the other twenty, nine do not occur at all elsewhere in corpus 2. We are justified in calling this list of 25 words, overall, a specialised vocabulary. The text is a technical text. Another 12 common collocations were defined in this way. The 60 content words in these definitions accounted for no less than $5 \%$ of the $^ { 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 + }$ word chemical engineering corpus: the reader will on average see a word from this list ten times on every page!

# 5. Objections

So far we have tried to show that collocations in the form of complex noun phrases are appropriate for pedagogic treatment because, first, they are extremely common in chemical engineering textbooks; and second, because they lend themselves to the creation of short definitional texts which are full of technical vocabulary (without baffling the layman teacher), and which in turn make highly appropriate reading material for second-year chemical engineering undergraduates.

There are of course arguments against this approach. First, the texts as they stand do not present enough textual material. This is easily remedied by expanding the definitions and supplying more background. An example can be seen in Appendix B. In connection with this some readers may also object that they do not have access to friendly engineers to write the definitional texts for them. One procedure here would be to type in a collocation that has been identified into a search engine. This will often result in a wealth of diverse material emanating from educational, industrial or encyclopedia-type sources, giving a large number of choices of texts suitable for adaptation or immediate use. The reader is invited to search for these three randomly selected collocations from corpus 1: distillation column, mass transfer, and pore diffusion. The first two of these show that a lot of material of an appropriate level is easily sorted from the more technical variety; the third that this is not always the case.

Another obvious objection is that the approach, while claiming to be lexical, seems to ignore so many words of the general and academic varieties (see e.g., Nation, 2001, pp. 11–21). The first point in answer to this is that about $50 \%$ of text coverage comes from function words, especially determiners and prepositions. There is no reason to believe that these will be under-represented in texts like those seen in Appendix B. Second, a large proportion of the most common words in corpus 1 can be represented in the collocationdefining texts. By treating these types of collocation through defining (unpacking) texts, we constantly recycle the most common chemical engineering words, and show how they combine with other words. In a sense, we move from breadth of more general vocabulary knowledge to depth of knowledge of particularly central vocabulary in the student’s engineering discipline.

# 6. Learning tasks

Shortage of space prevents a proper discussion of the type of teaching/learning tasks that might accompany the texts we have been describing, although for the pedagogue this is obviously at least as important a matter. This final section will confine itself to some general remarks on the subject, in two parts; first, teaching individual collocations, and second, teaching collocations as a class. It should be pointed out, however, that the distinction cannot always be precisely drawn. One would not, while teaching learners particular lexical items, deny that this will have any effect on the way that they process other lexical items in the same class (however difficult it may be to establish the nature and extent of this effect); and one cannot, while teaching at the more abstract level of the word or phrase in general, deny that the particular items that one uses as examples can, might or should be remembered by learners. The distinction might also be characterised as between process and product; when teaching about these phrases as a class we are more concerned with how students read, i.e. the process, while when they are taught individually (as items to be remembered) they become products.

For individual collocations, we do not see a sharp distinction from the teaching of individual words (cf. Lewis, 2000). Effective teaching is likely to involve active elaboration of the items, in the form of rich instruction (Nation, 2001, Chapter 3) or what has been called reading plus, ‘‘y repeated and diverse mental processing over timey’’ (Paribakht & Wesche, 1996; Wesche & Paribakht, 2000, p. 197). Some exercises exemplifying this approach, based on the text in Appendix B, are shown in Appendix D.

Teaching collocations as a class involves two steps. The first is raising students’ awareness of the existence and frequency of collocations. This is unlikely to be difficult, given their ubiquity in students’ L1. The same applies to the question of idiomaticity in collocations, which is likely to arise although it is not particularly salient in the corpora used here. The second step is teaching the process of reading collocations as chunks, perhaps by asking students to divide sentences into phrase- or clause-level constituents.

The tasks in Appendix D may be used with either product or process in mind. Of course it is not implied that they are the only type of task to be used in exploiting the texts (although these tasks may well cover a surprisingly large proportion of their content). What we have outlined in this article represents, we hope, just part of an approach which, for specialist relevance and appropriacy of difficulty, might represent an improvement on whatever is currently used in EAP engineering courses.

# Appendix B. A sample ‘‘unpacking’’ definitional text

A phase is a state of matter. Gas is one of these states. Other common states include solids, liquids, vapours, and plasmas. Gases have a very low concentration of molecules (number of molecules per cubic meter) compared to solid and liquid phases, meaning that gases tend to have low density, low viscosity, high diffusion rates, and the ability to expand and change shape to fill the space they are contained in. Individual chemical species, and mixtures of chemical species, may be gases depending on the temperature and pressure of the system that they are in. An example of usage is: ‘‘air is a gas mixture at atmospheric temperatures and pressures’’. Gas phase is a phrase that suggests what is being described occurs with all participating mixtures or elements being gases. For instance the description ‘‘ythe conversion of hydrogen sulphide to hydrogen and sulphur at 1100 Kelvin is a gas phase reaction’’ indicates that both the reagent species (hydrogen sulphide), and the product species (hydrogen and sulphur) are gases throughout the reaction. The phrase may appear instead as a hyphenated word in some instances, such as gas-phase equilibria.

# Appendix D. Some tasks for learners treating complex NP formation/collocation, based on the text in Appendix B (answers in italics)

These are just some examples of tasks and the reader should bear in mind the difficulty of clearly differentiating product and process considerations.

1. Aim: to raise awareness of collocation How many collocations with gas can you find in the text? Write them here. Gas mixture/gas phase/gas phase reaction/gas-phase equilibria

2. Aim: Comprehension/elaboration at phrase level

2a. Match the definition with the term   
product species—one or more species produced by a particular process   
Etc etc   
Etc etc   
2b. If hydrogen sulphide is the reagent species, what are the product species?   
Hydrogen and sulphur

3. Aim: to raise awareness of structure of NP collocations

3a. Is a chemical species a type of species or a type of chemical?   
Species   
3b. Some of the phrases below have their words in the wrong order. Mark them with an $x$ . see how quickly you can do this.   
Viscosity low $x$   
Species product $x$   
Low concentration   
Chemical species   
Mixture gas $x$   
Atmospheric temperatures   
3c. Rewrite the following phrases with the words in the correct order   
diffusion high rate high diffusion rate   
reaction gas phase gas phase reaction   
phase equilibrium gas gas phase equilibrium

3d. Rearrange the following phrases into a sentence.

gases tend to have/// and the ability to expand and change shape $/ / /$ high diffusion rates $/ / /$ low density $/ / /$ this means that $/ / /$ to fill the space $/ / /$ low viscosity $/ / /$ they are contained in This means that gases tend to have low density, low viscosity, high diffusion rates, and the ability to expand and change shape to fill the space they are contained in

4. Aim: Comprehension/elaboration at clause/sentence level

4a. True or false? Air is a gas mixture at atmospheric pressures True Gas phase should not be written gas-phase False There are only five states of matter False

4b. Answer each of the following yes, no, or maybe. Is hydrogen sulphide: A chemical species? Yes A product species? May be A reagent species? May be A gas phase? Yes A gas mixture? Yes A solid phase? No

4c. Answer these questions What is the difference between a reagent species and a product species? A product species is the species produced by the reaction between the reagent species

4d. Answer these questions yes, no, or sometimes Does hydrogen sulphide have A relatively low density? Yes A relatively high concentration of molecules? No Low viscosity? Yes

# 5. Aim: Elaboration/production of collocations

5a. Answer these questions   
What do we call a species produced by a particular process?   
Product species   
If we separate hydrogen sulphide into its component species, what do we call the result? Product species   
5b. Answer these questions   
What is the result of the low concentration of molecules in gases?   
They have low density, etc. etc.
