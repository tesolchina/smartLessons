# Abstract

The needs analysis of Israeli law students demonstrates the multifaceted factors involved in determining the needs of Israeli law students studying English as a foreign language. The needs include global ones, stemming from both the historical and present indebtedness of Israeli law to English law and the common law system, and individual ones which include both short term and long term needs. Short term needs reflect law school academic requirements, and long term needs reflect the professional needs of Israeli practitioners. In addition to the conflicting demands and requirements in the target situation analysis (TSA), this paper also briefly considers the deficiencies and constraints without which the needs portrayal would lead to unrealistic conclusions. The needs and the constraints together furnish a balanced presentation of the language learning situation in Israeli law schools, and thus provide the guidelines for setting the necessary priorities.

Communicative language theories have demonstrated that learners’ needs should no longer be defined in purely linguistic terms. Moreover, the language learner and his specific purpose for learning the target language have been brought to the forefront, since language use and the language user have assumed a central position in communicative theories. However, the implementation of needs analyses in general purpose English (GPE) courses has been fraught with difficulties because students’ needs are diverse and occasionally even unclear. In contrast, EAP learners form a homogeneous group by virtue of sharing the same future profession or studying the same subject. Consequently, these learners’ needs can be sought in their field of interest and their identified future performance in the target language. However, even in this seemingly more defined context, the analysis can only be effective if the academic language needs are accurately defined. To best serve the students, the needs analysis should seek utmost specificity within the specific target use.

The importance of specificity in language instruction has been recognized by Israeli institutions of higher education. Israeli undergraduates, who have to take an English course in order to complete their degree, are offered a variety of academic English courses in their various fields of study, particularly in fields with highly specialized discourse. Law is such a field in which every university or college offers a legal English course rather than a general English course. As Gibbons (1994: 3) observes, ‘‘every legal act, of whatever kind, is to a certain extent a linguistic event.’’ Therefore, Bhatia (1989: 223) argues, ‘‘of all the specialist disciplines that an ESP practitioner may be called upon to design and teach . . . perhaps in none of them the need to integrate the specialist content and the language used to communicate it is greater than in Law.’’ However, a brief survey of the materials used in Israeli legal English courses demonstrates that there is no shared approach and most of the materials are randomly collected. Hence, the following analysis is long overdue. The results of this analysis draw a clearer picture of the needs of Israeli law students.

# 1. Target situation analysis (TSA)

A target situation analysis should reflect the needs as determined by the eventual target situation (Hutchinson & Waters, 1987). However, the TSA of Israeli law students soon revealed the term ‘‘target situation’’ as vague and general. Consequently, the term had to be more closely defined for drawing a more accurate needs profile. To more accurately define the target situation of Israeli law students, the analysis examined two kinds of needs. The first kind is global target needs, stemming from the historical and current indebtedness of the Israeli legal system to foreign legal systems. The second kind of needs is individual target needs. These are partially derived from the global target needs but should nevertheless be analyzed separately. The individual needs are further divided into two categories, long term needs and short term needs.

# 1.1. Global target needs

The Israeli legal system, which follows the common law tradition, was historically connected to the English legal system by what was considered as obligatory ties. At present, the indebtedness may be described as voluntary or optional (Friedman, 1975). However, in spite of the reduced dependence of Israeli law on English law, the need for legal material in English has not been reduced, as expected. Consequently, Shachar, Charis, and Gross (1996) conclude that the indebtedness of Israeli law to English law has always been more voluntary than obligatory.

The historically formal ties to English law have thus been replaced by cultural and social ties to familiar and linguistically accessible legal systems, such as the English and American systems. Although the Israeli legal system has never been formally attached to American law, lately, more weight has been given to American decisions which, while obviously not binding, have assumed persuasive authority. American cases are frequently cited for legal support in Israeli decisions, occasionally for rejecting an English rule and adopting a new American doctrine. Due to the strong political, commercial and academic ties with the US, and also as a result of the tremendous cultural influence that the American culture has had on the Israeli society, American law has had a major impact on Israeli law (Snyder, 1985; Shachar et al., 1996). References are also made to other common law systems, notably Australian and Canadian law. Hence, because of historical, cultural and linguistic reasons, the majority of foreign law references are to common law decisions. Continental law and international law comprise a very small part of the body of citations.

Fig. 1 illustrates the percentage of references in Israeli Supreme Court decisions, including references to Israeli precedents. The diagram clearly demonstrates the constant decrease of foreign law references and the remarkable increase of references to Israeli precedents. The diagram also illustrates an increase in references to American law.

The logical conclusion from the steady decrease of references to common law cases would be that, currently, both Israeli law students and Israeli lawyers are less dependent on material written in English. However, while this observation is partially true, apparently the decrease in quantity has not entailed an equivalent decrease in quality. Common law precedents and legal theories and doctrines continue to be an important source of inspiration to Israeli judges, particularly those of the Supreme Court. The Israeli Supreme Court resorts to foreign law for comparative purposes or for inspiration and guidance, particularly in ‘‘first impression’’ decisions or in landmark decisions.

# 1.2. Individual target needs

Individual needs are significantly influenced by the global needs previously described. However, not all situations are equally affected by the global needs. To assess the needs of Israeli law students, it was necessary to distinguish between two kinds of individual needs, long term target needs and short term target needs. Short term needs reflect the demands of the academic institution. The academic requirements reflect the use of English and American legal material by the legal research community. Long term needs are the needs of legal practitioners. They are obviously not engaged in academic research, but they nevertheless face unresolved legal issues in Israeli law, or issues for which they believe, after having examined foreign law, that other systems provide more suitable, balanced and just solutions. The following analysis considers each type of needs separately.

There seems to be no direct correlation between lawyers’ needs and law schools’ English language requirements. Although law school prepares law students for a future career as lawyers, most courses are not practically oriented. Rather, law school provides the theoretical foundations and develops the research abilities necessary for the most complex instances of legal analysis. The differences between the professional and the academic requirements as well as the extent of overlap between the two are examined in this study for assessing their implications for instruction in legal English in law education.

# 2. Methods

The data were collected through interviews with law lecturers and questionnaires given to practicing lawyers. Some of the lawyers were also interviewed. The collection of data was administered with a high degree of explicitness which involved the use of ‘‘formal’’ and structured types of questions formulated in advance (Seliger & Shohamy, 1989; Sommer & Sommer, 1991). The methods employed in the study were both quantitative and qualitative. $T$ -Tests and Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used on the questionnaire data for examining the correlation between the lecturers’ and the lawyers’ responses, and also for examining correlations within the questionnaire data. Conflicting responses by the same lawyer or lecturer as well as exceptional or surprising views were discussed at length with both the lecturers and the lawyers. The study employed both methods to gain deeper insights than might have been reached through either method. Furthermore, second language acquisition studies, which usually focus on cognitive and socio-cultural factors, lend themselves best to the application of both methods (Davis, 1992). Thus, quantitative methods of analysis were first used for assessing the responses obtained and for correlating the data. Secondly, the qualitative analysis provided the evaluation and interpretation of the figures and insights gained from the interviews.

# 2.1. Participants

Information concerning law students’ English language needs was obtained from law lecturers and lawyers about their respective demands and needs. Twenty-seven lecturers were interviewed. Personal interviews were preferred over handed out questionnaires because they ensure the interviewee’s more serious attention and they also allow discussions of unanticipated issues that may arise during the interview, sometimes as a result of some surprising or contradictory responses. These ‘‘semiopen’’ discussions furnished valuable insights and new perspectives.

The 27 lecturers interviewed are a representative sample of Israeli law lecturers in universities as well as law colleges. A considerable number of them teach in both types of institutions and their course requirements in both are equal despite differences in the students’ academic level.

The lawyer questionnaires were answered by 113 lawyers. Approximately twothirds were from the Tel Aviv area, while others were from different parts of the country. About a third of the lawyers were personally interviewed. Two-thirds of the lawyers completed the questionnaires during in-service courses organized by the Israeli Bar Association.

Law students’ assessments were not incorporated in the needs analysis. First year law students were obviously unable to assess their needs, neither as students nor as future professionals. Even second and third year law students were able to provide only vague ideas on their needs as students. A similar view about the difficulty of obtaining significant data from students can be found in Richterich (1980: 47); Kennedy (1980: 120) and Brindley (1989: 78).

# 3. Results

The items in the questionnaires, for both the law lecturers and the lawyers, can be divided into five categories:

(a) the extent of English language use;   
(b) the importance of the English language;   
(c) the necessary linguistic skills;   
(d) the required genres; and (e) the sources of the required material.

# 3.1. The extent of English language use

Originally, both the lecturers’ and the lawyers’ questionnaires on this issue were based on the use of English in the different areas of law, such as contracts, company law, tort law etc. However, after interviewing several law lecturers, their responses indicated no distinctions in the English language demands among the various fields. Rather, the criterion for the evaluation of the amount of use of English lies in the distinction between required (main) courses, elective courses and seminars. The lecturers’ questionnaire was subsequently adjusted to reflect this distinction (Appendix A: questions 3, 4, 5). All lecturers, of different areas of law, distinguished between the required readings in the above three different types of courses. Fig. 2 demonstrates the differences between the requirements in the different types of courses.

During the interviews, the lecturers qualified some of the above findings. They explained that the reading demands in required courses reflect the abundance of available Hebrew material on most of the major and basic issues. The abundance of available Hebrew material is also reflected in the growing number of citations of Israeli precedents in Israeli Supreme Court decisions, as demonstrated by Shachar et al. (1996). However, in elective courses and seminars, the content becomes more complex, more specific and obscure. Some of the issues discussed in these courses have no clear or satisfactory solutions in Israeli law, therefore students are encouraged to look for legal solutions in other common law systems. Moreover, many lecturers explained that students in seminars are required to conduct comparative studies with other legal systems even in issues where there is material in Israeli law available because such an experience widens their horizons and opens new perspectives for a fruitful interaction with different legal doctrines and policies. Israel is a relatively new and small country and thus legal solutions from other countries may either be applicable to the Israeli context or, at least, be helpful in elucidating legal complexities. Legal transplants have always been part of legal practice and they are naturally based on the interaction between different legal systems.

Lawyers too were asked to state their area(s) of practice and indicate in which of these areas there is more of a need to use English (Appendix B: questions 3, 4). Yet, the attempt to get meaningful quantitative data from the lawyers about their use of English in different legal areas of their practice did not yield significant conclusions. However, the data did provide some interesting insights. For example, in some areas such as criminal or tax law, the use of English is rare or non-existent. Yet, a small number of lawyers, even in these areas, stated that they do use English and American material since in their practice employing material in English is necessary and occasionally even unavoidable.

![](img/a7fc9cc80d7204b364eb14b31d0823f0f90c442b81988c8d1f6245aa3585fe02.jpg)

The results of another question in the lawyers’ questionnaire (Appendix B: question 13), regarding their use of English, demonstrate that the long term needs are diverse. While a considerable number of lawyers $( 6 2 . 8 \% )$ stated that most or all of their work is done exclusively in Hebrew, others stated that their individual practice requires a considerable amount of work in English.

# 3.2. The importance of the English language

The lecturers’ questionnaire has two questions concerning the importance of English. The first question (Appendix A: question 1) reviews the importance of English for law students, while the second (Appendix A: question 2) examines the importance of the English language for academic legal research.

Among the lecturers, there was near unanimous consent that for research purposes, English is not only extremely important but even indispensable. No serious academic research can be conducted on any issue without a comparative study. However, only $7 4 . 1 \%$ said that English is very important for law students at law school. During the interviews, this attitude was explained on the basis of the uneven need for English in the different types of courses.

The question on the importance of English was also presented to lawyers (Appendix B: question 2). Among lawyers, $7 7 . 9 \%$ believe that English is very important or important. Fig. 3 illustrates the differences between the lecturers’ and the lawyers’ answers on the issue of the importance of the English language.

Considering that $6 2 . 8 \%$ of the lawyers admitted that they rarely use English in their practice, the figures representing the lawyers’ assessment of the importance of English are surprising. This lack of correlation was noticed during the interviews of some of the lawyers. When asked to explain their conflicting choices, they indicated that while their responses regarding the importance of the English language (Appendix B: question 2) were general and were not directly influenced by the extent of their personal use of English, their responses to the question about their use of English (Appendix B: question 13) reflected the assessment of their individual use. Yet, there are occasional instances in their practice in which English is indispensable. One lawyer even expressed the opinion that in such instances, a limited ability to function in English is tantamount to a handicap. Furthermore, lawyers also noted that the infrequent use of English in their offices was not by choice but rather by limitation dictated by their insufficient mastery of the language, or because their areas of practice usually require little recourse to foreign material. However, these lawyers were strongly aware that the ‘‘global village’’ effect, including developments in hi-tech and international communication, presents more and more cases where the use of English is indispensable. They also believe that if this observation is true at present, it will be even more so in the future and in more areas of law. Hence the perceived importance of English in the law school curriculum.

# 3.3. The necessary linguistic skills

In EAP environments, where a needs analysis is appropriate, it is possible to determine which of the four skills is most essential for the specific target language use. The importance of the above assessment stems from the acknowledgement that when planning a language course, not only necessities should be considered but also various constraints imposed by the parties involved. Thus, since all academic institutions have time constraints, there is an unavoidable need to set priorities, and focus on those skills which are more crucial for the specific intended use. Setting skill priorities in the instruction of academic legal English must reflect the distinction between the short term needs, determined by law school requirements, and the long term needs determined by legal practice.

Both groups in this study, the law lecturers and the lawyers, were asked to rank the four skills from 1 to 4, where 1 is the most important skill and 4 is the least important skill (Appendix A: question 6; Appendix B: question 11). Reading was unanimously chosen by all lecturers as the most important skill for law students. Listening, though ranked far behind reading, was considered second in importance.

The productive skills of speaking and writing were ranked as practically unimportant for law students. Moreover, during the interviews, the lecturers regarded the skill ranking as irrelevant. In their opinion, the only skill relevant to law students is reading.

The lawyers’ skill ranking yielded less definite priorities. The lawyers, like the lecturers, attributed the highest importance to reading. However, the relative degree of priorities is not identical. Fig. 4 represents the comparison of the relative priorities reflected in the lecturers’ and by the lawyers’ responses.

While the needs analysis yielded a lucid picture of the needs of students, lawyers’ skill priorities are less clear and therefore more difficult to define precisely. The inconsistency of priorities chosen by the lawyers reflects the diversity of professional practices which affects not only the extent of their use but also their individual use of the four skills.

The differences between the lecturers’ and the lawyers’ priorities raises the issue whether both short term and long term needs can be accommodated in an academic course of legal English. The answer to this question is not to be found in the realm of necessities but rather in the realm of constraints. Theoretically, a language course should aim at catering to the necessities dictated by the target situation. Yet, occasionally, as in this case, the target situation is complex since two target situations are involved and there is no total overlap of skill requirements. In addition, all legal English courses in Israeli universities and colleges are limited in duration, which implies that there is not enough time to accommodate both short term and long term needs. However, as both needs originate from the legal profession, there is a certain degree of overlap and therefore the decision about preference is somewhat easier. Logically, priority should be given to the needs of the students while they are still at law school, as is reflected in the lecturers’ needs assessment. Lawyers’ needs should be considered as long as they do not conflict with those of students. The overlapping needs are those that should be given highest priority.

![](img/50062febe82805d45daf3e001a57fa2195e8e8e6e23e6f77a064fc26b288c2e9.jpg)  
Fig. 4. Lecturers’ and lawyers’ ranking of the relative importance of the four language skills.

Thus, reading comprehension should certainly be given priority over other skills. Israeli law students need English only for reading legal English texts. In addition, two-thirds of the lawyers ranked reading in English as the most important English skill for their practice. However, for a certain percentage of practicing lawyers there are other skills besides reading which seem to be necessary for their work. Certain law offices have much personal interaction with English-speaking clients and therefore these lawyers consider listening and speaking as skills of highest priority, although they certainly also read in English.

The variety of needed skills reflected in the range of the lawyers’ skill priorities may be the rationale for some law schools’ English departments’ equal focus on all four language skills. But this policy is not based on a needs analysis. Both the previous skill analysis and the time constraint unquestionably indicate that priority should be given to developing reading comprehension skills in Israeli law schools.

However, a further analysis was conducted in order to re-examine this hypothesis. Lawyers were asked whether their English language skills were only acquired in high school and university in Israel, or also during a stay abroad or studies in an Englishspeaking environment (Appendix B: question 1). The analysis of their responses shows that $6 4 . 8 \%$ of the lawyers have acquired their language skills in Israel; $3 5 . 2 \%$ have been exposed to the English language more intensively during their stay or studies in an English-speaking environment. This information was correlated with other questionnaire data regarding the lawyers’ assessment of their reading and writing abilities (Appendix B: questions 5, 6), and their self-reliance in reading and writing in English in their legal practice (Appendix B: questions 7, 8, 10).

As anticipated, the data demonstrate that both the lawyers who only studied English in Israel and those who were also exposed to English abroad, assess that their writing abilities are below their reading abilities. Furthermore, the needs analysis also examined whether there is a difference in self-reliance in both reading and writing between the lawyers who studied English only in Israel and those who were also exposed to English abroad. T-tests were administered on the questionnaire data regarding the lawyers’ self-reliance in reading and writing in English (Appendix B: questions 7, 8, 10) and the data regarding the lawyers’ background knowledge of English (Appendix B: question 1).

The results show that the percentage of lawyers who rely on themselves or usually rely on themselves in reading English, among those who stayed or studied abroad, is significantly higher than among those lawyers who have only acquired English through their studies in Israel. The data on writing skills indicate that only $7 \%$ of the lawyers who acquired their English in Israel rely or usually rely on their own writing skills when they have to write in English, while $6 4 . 1 \%$ of the lawyers who had stayed or studied abroad claim that they do not seek help when writing in English. A closer examination of the English language background of these lawyers reveals that the great majority of them had not only stayed abroad but also acquired their legal education in English-speaking environments.

More significantly, even among those who had studied abroad, $3 5 . 9 \%$ do not feel confident enough to rely on their own English writing skills. During the interviews, some of the lawyers admitted that in spite of their extensive exposure to English and specifically legal English, they lack the necessary English writing skills. These lawyers explained that while in other professions exposure such as theirs might have allowed them to rely on their own knowledge, in law, language is not only a means to an end but also the end itself. Legal rights and obligations depend and are determined by accurate terminology and appropriate phrasing of legal documents. In law, as Maley (1994: 1) observes: ‘‘language is medium, process and product.’’ Consequently, the lawyer’s responsibility is to ensure that the language should not be vague or ambiguous, and that the proper terminology and phrasing are used. Thus, a significant number of these lawyers admitted that they regularly use the service of professional translators or preferably consult native English-speaking lawyers, who have practiced law in an English-speaking environment. In addition, currently, there is a file of standard legal forms in English for various documents. Therefore, first drafts can be prepared using these standard forms. Alterations to these forms, to meet particular needs, require the expertise of native English-speaking lawyers.

The combination of the difficulties of mastering legal writing, as reflected in the data analysis, and curricular time constraints, prove pretensions of teaching legal English writing as unrealistic and far-fetched. Improving Israeli law students’ writing abilities to match the abilities of those who stayed or studied abroad is unfeasible and utopian. Moreover, if we also consider that even many of those who studied abroad are not fully confident in their writing abilities, we must conclude that writing skills should not be part of the English language course in Israeli law schools.

Furthermore, in addition to the time constraint there is another constraint, which may be defined as subject matter deficiency. In considering the feasibility of teaching legal writing at Israeli law schools, there are two factors to be considered: (1) the need to write legal material in English arises only in legal practice, (2) the type of writing required in law firms is not part of academic legal education. Law students do not know how to phrase legal documents even in their native language. For instance, law students are unable to draft a contract even in Hebrew because the required course in contracts is theoretical. All practical implications are left for the apprenticeship which follows the academic studies, as demonstrated in Table 1.

Table 1 shows the lawyers’ responses to the question that asked them to state when they acquired their skill of drafting legal documents in Hebrew (Appendix B: question 12). The lawyers were asked to choose one of three possibilities: (1) first year law school, (2) second and third year law school, (3) in practice.

Eighty-seven percent of the lawyers stated that their drafting skills in Hebrew were acquired during practice, and $1 0 . 2 \%$ stated that they learned how to draft legal material in their second and third year at law school. Apparently, certain law schools offer a third year elective course in legal drafting where these students’ drafting abilities were partly acquired. Only $2 . 8 \%$ stated that they learned how to draft legal documents in their first year at law school. One, among the interviewed lawyers who studied law in England, explained that unlike Israeli policy, the first year law curriculum where she studied included legal writing.

Table 1 Lawyers’ responses to the question ‘‘When did you acquire your skill of drafting legal documents in Hebrew?’’   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>No. of lawyers.</td><td>Percentage (%)</td><td>Valid percentage (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Acquire in practice.</td><td>94</td><td>83.2</td><td>87.0</td></tr><tr><td>Acquire in 2nd and 3rd year law school</td><td>11</td><td>9.7</td><td>10.2</td></tr><tr><td>Acquire in 1st year law school</td><td>3</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>108</td><td>95.6</td><td>100.0</td></tr><tr><td>Missing data</td><td>5</td><td>4.4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>113</td><td>100.0</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Since most Israeli law students cannot draft legal documents in Hebrew, to expect them to do so in English is unfeasible. Introducing English legal writing creates an additional deficiency which should arguably be avoided. ‘‘Deficiency,’’ Alderson (1980: 135) says, ‘‘may include discovering whether students are required to do something in the target language which they cannot do in their mother tongue.’’

# 3.4. The required genres

The next consideration for the needs analysis is what legal genres should be emphasized in the academic legal English course. Despite the difficulties in the categorization of genres by communicative purposes (Askehave & Swales, 2001), genres are highly instrumental in professional communication. Genre ‘‘is a recognizable communicative event characterized by a set of communicative purposes(s) identified and understood by the members of the professional or academic community in which it regularly occurs’’ (Bhatia, 1993: 13). Therefore a course that ignores generic characteristics may fail in preparing students for their target use (Davies, 1988; Swales, 1984, 1990; Bhatia, 1993, 1997; Weissberg, 1993; Thompson, 1994; Johns, 1997). Legal material includes different genres which are not of equal importance for legal studies and legal practice. Again, the time constraint requires setting priorities. Both law lecturers and lawyers were asked to rank the following genres of legal material: court decisions, articles, books, legislation, legal documents, from 1 to 5 in descending order of importance for students and in legal practice, respectively (Appendix A: question 7; Appendix 2: question 9).

Articles are the highest priority in the reading requirements of law lecturers; $6 9 . 2 \%$ of lecturers ranked articles as the most important. The other genres were ranked in the following order of importance: books, court decisions, legislation, and legal documents.

For legal practice, legal documents are the highest in order of importance; $5 6 . 9 \%$ of the lawyers indicated that for them documents are the most important English material. The other genres were ranked in the following order of importance: court decisions, legislation, books, and articles. Fig. 5 demonstrates the differences in genre assessment between the lawyers and the law lecturers.

There is little correlation between the genre ranking of the law lecturers and that of the lawyers. This lack of correlation represents a considerable conflict between short term (EAP) and long term (ESP) needs which must be seriously considered. Unlike the data on the skills’ priorities of law school and legal practice, in genre priorities there is almost no overlap. However, the most urgent needs must be addressed first. The most urgent needs of law students are the requirements to read legal articles and sections of books for their legal education. These two genres analyze legal issues in a theoretical manner with reference to both legislation and case law. Furthermore, the academic genres of articles and books are shared by all academic disciplines. Thus, focusing on articles and books at law school will familiarize law students not only with genres specific to law but also with the genres of academic publications. Reading and drafting of legal documents, which received highest priority by the lawyers, are not part of Israeli law schools’ curriculum. Therefore, they should arguably not be included in the legal English program. However, reading of court decisions and legislation is integral to law school education. Therefore, they should be an integral part of the legal English course. The relative amount of course time allocated to them should correspond to the importance attributed to them by the lecturers’ rankings.

Fig. 5. A comparison between lecturers’ and lawyers’ ranking of relative importance of different genres.

# 3.5. Sources of the required reading material

The last issue concerns the sources of academic legal readings in English. In the description of global needs, Shachar et al. (1996) demonstrate the growing influence of American law on Israeli law. The same tendency is also reflected in the lecturers’ ranking of their reading requirements in English. They were asked to rank the following sources in a descending order of importance: (1) American law, (2) English law, (3) other laws (Appendix A: question 8).

As many as $8 2 . 6 \%$ of the lecturers stated that American law was the most important source; $1 8 . 2 \%$ ranked English law as the most important source of foreign law, and only $6 . 3 \%$ of the lecturers indicated that other legal systems were the most important sources of their reading requirements.

Discussions with the lecturers yielded some explanations of the above data. The preference of American law by many lecturers is based not only on the generally growing influence of American law but also on two other factors: (1) in certain legal areas, American law is much more advanced than other legal systems and therefore students are referred to this material which is more innovative and offers creative solutions to current legal problems; (2) many lecturers completed their PhD or other advanced degrees in the US and, therefore, are more familiar with American legal material. Those lecturers who prefer English law to other legal systems mentioned that English law still exerts a considerable influence over certain areas of Israeli law such as torts. One lecturer, who chose the third option, namely other laws, as the most important source of reading material, teaches international law in which material is intrinsically international.

The practical implications of the above source analysis should be carefully examined. Obviously, because of the prevalence of American law, more material should be taken from American sources. Yet, it is evident that students should also be exposed to English law to familiarize themselves with English case law which is somewhat different from American case law.

In conclusion, the TSA of law students in Israel yields significant information on all five issues investigated. The study demonstrates that a thorough analysis of the most crucial issues is helpful for determining the appropriate materials and skills which best serve the target needs.

# 4. Constraints

While the focus of this paper is the analysis of target needs, specific constraints posing obstacles to its achievement must be addressed. Presenting the target needs without considering both the constraints and the means to avoid or minimize their detrimental effects, would be ineffective.

# 4.1. Linguistic constraints

The gap between the target proficiency and the learner’s existing proficiency is defined by Hutchinson and Waters (1987) as the learner’s ‘‘lack.’’ West (1994) terms these ‘‘lacks’’ as ‘‘deficiencies.’’ Considering the learners’ lacks is estimated to be a more learner-centered approach than defining the target needs (Mackay & Bosquet, 1981; Mountford, 1988; Nunan, 1988). However, the definition of the learners’ lacks depends on the definition of the target needs. While, theoretically, goal-oriented syllabuses and process-oriented syllabuses have been treated as different approaches (Widdowson, 1979, 1984), in practice, they can hardly be separated. Once the goal has been defined by the TSA, the means for achieving the goal greatly depends on the anticipated required standards. Thus, certain objective and absolute lacks may not be considered relevant by the requirements of a particular EAP course. For example, the needs analysis for the legal English program determined that writing skills need not be part of the course. Consequently, the assessment of lacks should not consider writing skills but rather focus on reading skills.

In general, the target performance of law students requires a high standard of English reading proficiency. Students are required to read articles from academic law reviews and book excerpts written in the highest standards of professional legal English. This standard of required performance should always remain in the foreground for setting the desired optimum achievement level. However, the required target performance is not always fully attainable. Namely, the legal English course cannot reasonably succeed in advancing all students to the level of reading proficiency necessary for reading legal English material.

Although law schools in Israel require a minimum English entrance level, the level of the students’ linguistic proficiency varies since they are accepted on the basis of their overall average. Some students lack the linguistic capacity required for participating in the legal English course. These students are first assigned to a preparatory course intended to improve their English language skills. The TSA should arguably determine the syllabus of the preparatory course as well as that of the legal English course. For example, the preparatory course should focus mainly on developing the students’ reading skills. Catering to other lacks should be minimized since it will obviously have to come at the expense of that skill which is, as the TSA demonstrated, the most important skill for Israeli law students. Thus, target needs analysis sets the ideal goal while the students’ linguistic lacks determine how much of the goal is realistically attainable and also which methodological means should be implemented for the achievement of the goal.

# 4.2. Subject-matter constraints

While linguistic lacks are individual and therefore vary from student to student, subject-matter constraints are shared by all the students of the EAP legal course. Law students’ subject-matter constraints can be divided into two categories: (i) constraints stemming from the academic curriculum; (ii) constraints due to the difference between academic legal needs and the needs in legal practice—short term needs vs. long term needs.

(i) Legal English is part of the first year curriculum in Israeli law schools. Required courses for first year law students expose them to a limited number of legal areas, mainly, contracts, torts, constitutional law and criminal law. This deficiency of content material should be considered when planning the English course.

As studies in schema theories have demonstrated, understanding greatly depends on background knowledge. Hence, the development of law students’ reading skills in English can be best achieved by using texts from legal fields familiar to them by course work. Namely, since the language course is not intended to teach substantive legal material, it must be based on legal concepts previously acquired in the legal courses. This approach obviously limits the legal topics available for developing the students’ reading skills. However, this seeming deficiency does not reduce the efficiency of the language course. On the contrary, language and reading skills successfully developed through exposure to texts from familiar legal areas will be more successfully applied later to texts in other areas, when students become familiar with them in their future studies.

(ii) The previous needs analysis demonstrates no absolute correlation between law students’ needs and the needs of lawyers. This gap may be considered a deficiency since the language course, as taught in Israeli universities and colleges, cannot cater equally to these conflicting needs. Yet, this subject-matter deficiency would not be considered such if we acknowledged that language courses offered at tertiary level are EAP courses. ESP literature recognizes that unlike EPP courses, intended to improve the language skills of professionals, EAP courses are intended to help students comply with academic requirements. In many areas of academic studies in Israel, such as social work or education, students are only required to use English during their studies or if they choose an academic career. Therefore, EAP courses in these areas serve only academic needs. Academic careers may also be the choice of some law students. These students’ future needs fully correspond to law schools’ academic requirements. Most law professors in Israel have developed excellent reading skills in legal English, which serve them well in legal research, while their writing and speaking skills are considerably lower. This deficiency does not impede their academic careers. Thus, the gap between academic needs and professional needs should not necessarily be viewed as a deficiency. The attempt of some law schools’ English departments to cater to the professional needs of lawyers is based on a misconception. It stems from a misunderstanding of the nature of EAP courses, which have been distinguished from EPP courses intended for different needs or requirements.

Law students, unlike many other students in Israel, will eventually need to use English in their future professional careers. This fact was taken into consideration in the process of the needs analysis. Consequently, areas where the study demonstrates a high correlation between both academic and professional needs were considered to be of highest priority. Where there is no correlation, law school needs should arguably take precedence over future professional needs which are not only remote but also, as a result, undefined.

# 4.3. Time constraint

Designers of academic legal English courses in Israel have to deal with the time constraint of the course. This constraint stems from both budgetary considerations and law schools’ unrealistic evaluation of the time required for achieving the target goal. Language syllabus designers usually have little control over global institutional policies. Although they often feel that more time would have allowed more students to achieve the desired proficiency, they have to accommodate this constraint and plan the language course to maximize the students’ benefit within the limited time allocated. Therefore the legal English language course should be based on a considerable amount of guided independent reading. Since the focus in the legal English course should be on the development of reading skills, independent reading can be done at home and class meetings can be used for reviewing and emphasizing important issues.

# 4.4. Constraint of the language teachers’ lack of legal education

While legal English teachers have to deal with highly professional material, most of them have never had a legal education. Various solutions have been offered to overcome this serious obstacle that results in both the production of unprofessional course material and the students’ negative attitude to the course due to their language teachers’ deficiency. Several law schools employ lawyers for teaching legal English to overcome the negative effects of unprofessional language courses. However, lawyers lack the pedagogical background for teaching a language course.

There is obviously no easy solution to this problem. There are some legal English teachers, though very few, who have both legal and pedagogical-linguistic education. But since this type of ‘‘hybrid’’ teacher is rare (Kennedy, 1980), other solutions have been suggested, such as team teaching or collaboration with content lecturers (Selinker, 1979; Loveday et al., 1980; Adams-Smith, 1980; Skehan, 1980; DudleyEvans, 1984; de Escorcia, 1984), or ‘‘ideally, the language teacher should take the first year law school’’ (Howe, 1990: 235). However, these solutions depend on language teachers’ recognition of their serious lack and on law professors’ willingness to give them professional assistance. Any kind of cooperation or preferably legal education will minimize the extent of this constraint and should therefore be encouraged.

# 5. Conclusion

The needs analysis has demonstrated both the complex network of elements which play a significant role in determining the needs of Israeli law students, and the unavoidable necessity to set priorities. The target needs stem from two central factors: global needs and individual needs. Global needs originate from both the historical indebtedness to English law and the present influence of common law legal systems, notably American law. Individual needs include short term needs, dictated by the academic requirements, and long term needs, which are reflected in the use of the English language by Israeli lawyers. In addition to the needs, the analysis also considered the deficiencies and constraints. The analysis of the deficiencies and the constraints has shown that neither the deficiencies nor the TSA has an independent value. They rather define each other and have thus set realistic criteria for portraying a balanced picture of the language learning environment in Israeli law schools.
