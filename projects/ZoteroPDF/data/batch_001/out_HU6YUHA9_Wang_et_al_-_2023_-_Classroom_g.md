Gesture has been recognized as an important aspect of second language (L2) acquisition, playing a vital role in L2 communication. Previous research has shown that L2 learners' communicative efficacy can be facilitated through gesture mediation. In particular, L2 learners may find gesture a useful tool to deliver their subject-related academic presentations. However, whether classroom gesture instruction could boost L2 learners' gesture use in academic speaking context and their overall presentation performance has rarely been explored. Drawing on activity theory, this study aims to investigate the potential role of gesture instruction in intermediate L2 English learners' gesture use and their academic presentation performance. Our study found that L2 learners who received classroom gesture instructions showed significant improvement in their use of gestures, and outperformed the control group in a post-test presentation session, showing improvement in all gesture types among which beats were significantly increased. These findings confirm the teachability of gesture to enhance Chinese L2 English learners' academic presentation skills, proving gesture as an indispensable instructional component in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classroom.

# 1. Introduction

The last two decades have seen an emerging multimodal trend that ascribes significance to semiotic discourses other than speech (Forcevill & Uri0s-Aparisi, 2009; Lampert, 2013; Saddour, 2017), motivating research that inquiries into the semiotic aspects of oral discourse, such as gestures (Goldin-Meadow, 200; Goldin-Meadow et al., 2001; Gulberg et al., 2008; Zdrazilova et al., 2018) Gestures, the spontaneous movements of arms and body accompanying speech (McNeil, 2008), are viewed as a flexible semiotic system diffrent but equall if not more important than linguistic system in human communication (Kendon, 1994). They both form indispensable parts of human thought representation and jointly promote the expression of ideas (McNeill, 1992, 2008, 2016) in oral discourse. Considerable research (e.g, Goldin-Meadow et al., 2001; Kita et al., 2017) has recognized gesture as an important communicative strategy that uses set f rhetorical body language or embellishments of verbal messages to shape social interactions, such as public speech.

A proliferation of studies has demonstrated the importance of gesture-speech interplay in various discourses (Holler & Beattie, 2003; Hood & Forey, 2005; Mendoza-Denton & Jannedy, 2011; Valeiras-Jurado & Ruiz-Madrid, 2019).For example, beats, one type of gesture, can visually highlight specific words or phrases in language production, thus improving speakers discourse performance (Vila-Gimenez et al., 2019). Academic presentation, as an important way for researchers to socialize into the academic community (Morell 2015), often requires researchersto communicate their thoughts and concetualizations in certain disciplinary areas clearly through multimodal channels (Valeiras-Jurado & Ruiz-Madrid, 2019), including gestures. Air quotes, for instance, have ben found to pragmatically signal the vaguenes/precision of a term indiscourse and show the presenters commitment to thetruth condition of the proposition (Cirill, 2019). It was also found that speakers may transmit messages by adding redundant information through gesture use (Morell 2015, 2018). These embodied gestures efectively show the researchers positions on a given scientific idea in academic presentations. However, few studies have focused on gesture instruction as a pedagogical too to facilitate second language (L2) learners' academic presentations.

# 1.1. Gesture and gesture instruction in L2 classrooms

As "visible action used as an utterance or a  part of an utterance" (Kendon, 2004, p. 7), gestures could be unwittingly produced to enhance communicative expressivenes. According to McNeill (1992), gestures could be categorized into four types: metaphorics to externalize abstract ideas or provide additional information about verbal descriptions (Herbert & Pierce, 2013); deictics to ilustrate information with precision by locating the speech content i the distant or proximal environment; iconics to elaborate on messages, such as shape, movement, or other concrete detail in explanatory or narrative discourse (Kang et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2009); and beats to stress certain expressions and help the speakers hold their turns (Dimitrova et al., 2016; Duncan, 1972).

Gesture and speech are systematically organized from the same idea units and linked semantically and pragmatically, constituting a cognitive and communicative integrated system. Recent research has highlighted the cognitive benefits of gesture use in L2 classroom instructions (Alibali et l., 2017; Kim & Cho, 2017; So et al., 2013). For example, weller e l. (2020) asked Englis-speaking students to recall Japanese verbs (with English translations) in the no-gesture, gesture-observing, and gesture-observing-and-reproducing conditions, finding an improvement in participants' word recall in the gesture conditions. They attributed such enhancement to gestures' cognitive function to licit motor imagries as mental reresentations of spech information to facilitate vocabulary learning. Kell e al. (2017) were also among the few who found that instructional metaphorics could embody abstract meanings for L2 students to deepen their speech comprehension (Carney, 2014). Therefore, L2 teachers were found to deliberate their atention to the semiotic values of gesture use in classroom teaching (Eskildsen & Wagner, 2013; Iizuka et al., 2020; Valeiras-Jurado & Ruiz-Madrid, 2019), highlighting gestures' mediational function in regulating L2 learners thinking and meaning-making processes (Gullberg, 2010; Smotrova & Lantolf, 2013).

Researchers have recently drawn their attention to asess the potential value of classroom activities to raise L2 learners' gesture awareness and use. Hilliard (2020), for instance, found that participants produced gestures more frequently and expressively when they were required to use both language and gesture in classrom activities. What should be noted, however, is that there has been no consensus on the teachabilit of gesture in L2 classrooms. For example, Parrl et al. (2016) found no significant changes in partici. pants' gesture frequency and gesture type in a quasi-conversational task, a spatial problem-solving task, and a narrative task after explicit gesture instruction. Further studies are, therefore, needed to address such inconsistency in these findings.

What may make the teachability of gesture in L2 classroms a more complicated issue is the cross-cultural differences in how pople perceive gsture use in oral discourse Pika et al., 2006). ompared wth leners from gestre-ncouraging cultures (g., the .s. and Germany) where various gestures are used to expres their desires since infancy, Chinese learners were more likely to produce \*quiet gestures" for slf-reglation and compliance (won et al., 2018). Moreover, Chinee learrs are found to gestculate es frequently or tend to produce the same type of gestures regardless of the semantic or pragmatic content in oral communications (Jiang & Wang, 2013). This may be partly due to Chinese learners relatively reserved attitude shaped by the Confucian tradition that restrains expansive body postures (Li, 2020; So, 2010). It could also be atributed to Chinese larners' general lack of awarenessof the importance of gesture use in L2 oral discourse due to their limited gesture training in L2 classrooms.

In multimodal discourse of academic presentations where researchers are responsible for communicating their research ideas and highlighting their contributions orally in a given time span, gestures can serve to complement oral speech by adding the visual dimension to (1) crystalize conceptual thinking eg., metaphorics and iconics), which is, otherwise, dificlt to articulate by language alone, (2) guide audience to navigate the study (e.g., deictics), and (3) strengthen speakers' positions (e.g., beats). In short, speech/ gesture synthesis greatly contributes to discourse coherence by creating and maintaining discourse topics (McNeill& Levy, 1993) Co-expressve with speech, gesture use in academic presentations has evidently become an important dimension of language learning for L2 learners. When failig t realize these potentiall useful onitive and communcatie functions in oral discourse (Cienki, 2016), Chinese graduate cience students as intermediate English learners may find themselves less expressve in academic presentations. Such discrepancy between the necessity to incorporate semiotic resources in oral speech and learners' general lack of gesture awarenessand training call for in-depth exploration into gesture intructions on improving Chinese students' gesture use and aca demic presentation performance in pedagogical settings.

# 1.2. Activity theory

Activity theory (AT) developed as a branch of sociocultural theory believes that human mind is mediated through physical and symbolic tols. Based on Vygotsky's view of cultural mediation of actions, activity system is characterized as a network of collctive, artifact-mediated, and object-oriented system (Engestrom, 1987, Fig 1) describing the basic structure of human behavior as including elements of subject, object, medational means, rules community, division of labor, and outcomes. In this system, Subjects, viewed as the agents of actions, make decisions and regulate their actions to pursue their objects (i.., goals) and provide an outcome (i.., so. lutions or ideas) within a commnity (i.e. socil groups) by fllowing rules i.., guidlies or regulations) and capitalizing on medating artifacts (i., resources) in an activity. The tasks may be distributed among the subjects (division of labor). These interrlated elements could create a continuous ecological circuit of body, mind, and the environment (Bateson, 1972), helpful for individuals to regulate themselves to accommodate the socio-cognitive environment.

AT has been widely applied in language clasroom research (e.g., Engestrom, 1999; Lam, 2021; Zeng & Evans, 2022), including writing instruction (Alln, 2010; De Costa et al., 2022; Fujioka, 2014; Li, 2013; Liu et al., 2022) and adaptive e-learning context (Pearson, 2009; Pena-Ayala et al., 2014). It has been shown that the interactive activity network is useful in shaping L2 students learning experiences. However, little research focuses on gesture instruction guided by the activity system.

As asemiotic mediation, gesture is important for people to engage in human activities. AT-informed gesture instructions featuring collective practices may potentiall transform the traditional teaching approach into an embodied one which views 2 learners, their gestural development and language performance and the scientificlassroom community as a unified and dynamic system. Therefore, from an AT perspective, the present study seeks to address the following research questions:

1. Do clasroom gesture instructions affect Chinese intermediate learners gesture productions in terms of frequency and type? If yes, how?   
2. Do classroom gesture instructions enhance Chinese intermediate English learners academic presentation performance? If yes, how?

# 2. Methods

# 2.1. Research context and participants

This study was conducted in a research university in Beijing, China, which sets the training of future scientists as its educational ideal. Fift-one first-year science students (21-24 years old, intermediate level) who took an EAP Writig and Speaking course offered by Author 2 participated in the study, with 29 in the experimental group $\mathrm { ( m a l e = 1 7 }$ female $= 1 2$ ) and 22 in the control group (male $=$ 12, female $= 1 0$ . Their majors cover such scientific disciplines as physics, chemistry, ecology, materials science, engineering, marine science, geoscience, psychology, and medicine, comprising a classroom community not only for language learning but also for academic ltracy development. The Quick Oxford Placement Test (QOPT) was used to asses the EAP students English proficiency see Appendix I), based on which participants were categorized into advanced- ${ \mathfrak { m } } = 2 \gamma$ , intermediate- $\left( \mathbf { n } = 5 1 \right)$ , and elementary-level $\mathbf { n } =$ 1) learners and the intermediate students were selected as our participants. Participants in both the experimental and control groups received instructions on academic English presentations offred by Author 1 who served as ateaching assistant i the EAP course, but only the experimental group received explicit instructions on gestures.

Following AT (see Fig. 2), the students were primarily seen as the subjects constituting the classroom community, an interactive science network connecting community members to deliver their scientificresearch. The mediating artifacts included classroom instructional plans based on gestures, power-point slides on gesture introductions and Three Minute Thesis (3MT) academic presentation video-clips. The 3MT presentations increasingly recognized as an academic genre (Hu & Liu, 2018) to present a disciplinary novelty were used for providing basic concepts of gesture types and forms in situated academic context, which aimed at cultivating L2 EAP learners capacity to communicate efectively in academic discourse. The rules were the requirements that students should follow to comprehend gestures and complete the1-min presentation task during our instruction as regular practice in the EAP class to engage students into the experiential interaction with the classroom science community through their gesture use. The divisions of labor were based on the interactions between teachers' supportive instructions and learners' engagement, in which Authors 1 and 2 oriented themselves toward cultivating the atmosphere for their students' motivation and engagement in embodied gesture learning. Based on the interrelationship among different elements in the activity system, the object f our instruction was students improved academic presentation performance with eficient gesture production as the outcome. The unified and dynamic system thus helped Authors 1 and 2 to organize their instruction design and carry out gesture teaching.

# 2.2. Research and instruction procedure

Research procedure and instructional procedure are presented in Fig. 3.

In week 1, afer the QOPT was carried out, a general introduction to academic presentation was given to the control and exper. imental groups in cass without any pecific gestre instuctions (e Fig. 3). Aadmic prestations on topics o students own choices from both groups were collected to ensure no significant differences in their presentation scores $\mathrm { Q f } = 4 9$ $\mathrm { t } = 0 . 2 3$ $\mathbf { p } = . 8 1$ ) and gesture use $\left( \mathbf { p s } > . 0 5 \right)$ . Each student blind to the research aims then made a 3-min academic presentation with power-point slides as pretest. Their presentations were video-recorded at a $2 \mathrm { m }$ -distance in front of the participants by Author 1. The pretest videos were compared with 20 video-clips (female $= 1 2$ , male $= 8$ ) of international 3MT presentation competitions during 2014-2018 randomly selected by Author 1, whose topics were similar to those of the participants' presentations, to understand how Chinese L2 intermediate learners may gesture diffrently from their international counterparts. Both Chinese and intenational students' gesture use in their academic presentations was independently annotated by Authors 1 and 2 based on gesture clasification scheme proposed by McNeill(1992), and compared for gesture type (i.e., beats, iconics, metaphorics, and deictics) and frequency represented as gesture per minute (see Appendix II). The randomlyselcted 3MT competition videos were also used as valuable teaching materials for Author 1' classroom instructions on the language features and genre-specific structures (e.g, research background, concepts, methods, and results) of academic presentations for both groups, and for gesture instructions (e.g., gesture types, forms, and functions) for the experimental group in Weeks 2-11.

During Weeks 2-11, the control and experimental groups were given different 20-min weekly instructions on academic pre sentations, with the experimental group receiving additional instructions on gesture use. When teaching beats, for example, the definition and functions of beats in word memorization, discourse construction, and L2 pronunciation were introduced to the experimental group,followed by examples of beats in 3MT video-clips to ilustrate the different forms of "finger drum' and \*finger snap'. They were then encouraged to have short in-class discussions on presenters' gesture use in the 3MT, such as the prominent features of gesture, their functions in academic discourse, and the identification of gesture types. The discussions were designed to raise students' gesture comprehension by motivating them to internalize gestures into their own communication. For the control group, the discussions were mainly focused on the overall academic presentation skill without foregrounding on gestures. After the general inroduction and discussion, participants in both groups were asigned a1-min in-clas presentation task to present scientific background, methods, and results once a wee, and for the experimental group, additional attention was paid to students gesture use. Afterwards, teachers and students in the experimental group particularly discussed the gesture use to further engage learners in the embodied learning of academic presentations within the classroom science community.

In Weeks 3 and 9, we invited 5 volunteers (female $= 2$ , male $= 3$ ) from the experimental group for two semi-structured group interviews to understand their perspectives of classroom gesture instruction. Two of them (student 1 and student 2) attended both interviews during which they were able to reflect on the possible changes of their gesture use when delivering academic presentations. Each interview, conducted in Chinese (see Appendix $\mathrm { I V }$ for interview questions) by Author 1, was video-recorded and lasted for 30-45 min.

In Week 12, both groups gave 3-min video-recorded academic presentations in class on topics of their own choices as a postest to see whether gesture instructions improved the experimental group's gesture use.

# 2.3. Data analysis

To address the frst research question that investigates whether gesture intructions afect Chinese intermediate larners gesture frequency and type, we analyzed our data both quantitatively and qualitatively. For quantitative data, student-produced gesture type and their respective frequency in their posttest presentations were coded and compared between the experimental and control goups, and comparisons were also made between the experimental group's pretest and posttest presentations. The postest videos of the experimental group were also compared with 20 intenational 3MT presentations for gesture type and frequency (see Appendi I) to further reveal the experimental group's possible changes afer their 10-week's gesture training. All the participants' pretest and posttest presentations as well a the 3MT presentations from international competitions were coded with ELAN (see Fig. 4) by Authors 1 and 2, with the inter-coder reliability on gesture production in $1 5 \%$ of the randomly-selected videos (18 cases) reaching $9 7 \%$ , and their disagreements were discussed and resolved.

For content analysis, we randomly selected 10 presentation videos (2 from the pretest and posttest of the control and experimental groups respectively, and 2 from the international 3MT presentations) and analyzed the associations between the gestures used and their intended meanings to further illustrate whether the gesture instruction facilitate L2 learners' effective communication in academic presentations.

To answer the second research question regarding the effectiveness of gesture instructions on enhancing students' academic presentation performance, we scored both groups presenations (112 cases) based on the rating rubric (see Appendix V) adapted from Bankowski (2010) by two experienced speaking instructors whose first languages are English and Chinese respectively. Blind to the instructional condition and the research purpose, the inter-rater reliability was acceptable (Cronbach's $\begin{array} { r } { \alpha = 0 . 7 7 2 } \end{array}$

The supplementary interviews were transcribed and coded by Authors 1 and 2 for significant meanings concerning both researcl questions. The selected interview excerpts were translated and cross-checked by Authors 1 and 3.

# 3.1. Effects of classroom gesture instruction on gesture production

Table 1 shows the dferences in gesture frequency in the pretest and postet for experimental and control groups. Paired-sample ttest shows no significant changes in general gesture frequency $\mathrm { T } = 1 . 5$ $\mathfrak { p } = . 1 4 8 )$ and frequencies of four gesture types $\left( \mathtt { p s } > . 0 5 \right)$ for students from the control group in the pretest-posttest comparisons (see Appendix I for descriptive results on gesture frequency). In contrast, there is a significant difference in terms of learners' general gesture frequency for the experimental group ${ \bf \Delta } ( { \bf t } = - 4 . 4 8$ $\boldsymbol { \mathbf { p } } =$ .000), indicating the positive effect of classroom gesture instruction. Specificall, significant differences were found for beats $\mathbf { \hat { t } } =$ $- 3 . 0 9$ $\mathfrak { p } = . 0 0 4 )$ , deictics $( \mathbf { t } = - 2 . 9 6$ $\mathfrak { p } = . 0 0 6 )$ , and metaphorics $( \mathrm { t } = - 2 . 8 3$ $\mathbf { p } = . 0 0 9 )$ , indicating the positive effects of classroom gesture instruction on the three gesture types. The effects of training on iconics, however, were insignificant $( \mathrm { t } = - 1 . 6 2 $ $\mathfrak { p } = . 1 1 7 )$

The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test in Table 2 demonstrates statisticall significant difference in general gesture frequency between the control and the experimental groups in the posttest $( \mathfrak { p } = . 0 0 7 )$ , showing that classroom gesture instruction has positively affected learners' overall gesture use. Specifically, significant difference was found for the use of beats $( \mathtt { p } = \mathtt { . 0 0 4 } )$ between the experimental and control groups, marginal difference was found for the use of metaphorics $\left( \mathtt { p } = . 0 5 6 \right)$ ; and no statistically significant differences for the use of deictics $( \mathtt { p } = . 1 0 2 )$ and iconics $\left( \mathtt { p } = . 1 9 6 \right)$

Further analysis of the presentations from the control group in their pretest and postest showed that without explicit gesture instruction, Chinese L2 learners are not used to producing gestures to communicate thoughts in academic presentations. Their production of beats and deictics seemed quite unconscious, only to regulate themselves or point to their slides (see Fig. 5), lacking communicative element either in delivering thoughts or connecting with the audience I contrast, students in the experimental group improved their gesture production to visualize or complement their scientific speech content in the posttes. For example, the student (in Fig. 6) was more likely to produce non-referential beats repeatedly in his first presentation, which mainly functioned as strengthening speech rhythm and making self-regulations. After the clasroom intruction, he produced different forms of meaning. enhancing metaphorics (Fig. 7) to present complicated scientific ideas within a larger gesture pace. To express the semantic content of \*the key to the lock' to illustrate the working mechanism of the drug to stop the virus from spreading, he roduced metaphorics to support the spatial information in the accompanying speech. However, there are conditions (se Fig. 8) when the presenters produced no gestures both in the pretest and posttest in spit of the instruction, showing ther sill nefficient bodily engagement in the classroom science community.

Moreover, despite the increased gesture frequency produced by Chinese learners and improvement in their awarenessin incor. porating appropriate gestures when giving academic presentations, they tend to use various gestures to communicate more semantic meanings than to hold discourse coherence. By contrast, international presenters were found to constantly produce coverbal gestures to facilitate the presentation flow. For instance, the presenters in Fig. 9 used metaphorics to present the concept of fast speed" and introduce "research aim'. In a word, intenational competitors were found to flexibly and strategical use different gesture types to achieve various discourse functions, such as manifesting rich concepts ranging from abstract scientific explanations to modal particles, establishing cohesion in the academic discourse, and boosting persuasion integrated with intonation and eye contact forming an implicit communicative tie between the presenter and the audience.

Fig. 10 displays the mean scores of EAP learners academic presentations in the control and experimental groups. Paired-sample t tests show no significant change for the control group $\mathrm { ( t = . 7 1 }$ $\mathsf { p } = . 4 8 4 )$ and significant improvement for the experimental group $\left( \mathbf { t } = \right.$ 0.71, $\mathfrak { p } = . 0 0 3 )$ in their presentation scores. Independent sample-t test also shows that the experimental group outperformed the control group in the posttest $( \mathbf { t } = - 2 . 0 2$ $\mathfrak { p } = . 0 4 9 \mathrm { , }$ , indicating the effectiveness of classroom gesture instruction on enhancing L2

learners' academic presentation performance.

Further independent sample-tets (Table 3) and paired-sample tests (Table 5) on sub-scores of the rubric (e.g., content, skill, language) between groups show that there is a significant improvement in scores on skills $\mathbf { \hat { t } } = - 3 . 6 2 9$ $\mathbf { p } = . 0 0 1 $ ) and a slight progress in terms of content and language for learners from the experimental group (Table 4), indicating the beneficial role of gestures in enhancing the overall academic presentation performance. In the control group, we found no such significance in content $\mathrm { ( t = } . 0 0 5$ p $= . 9 9 6 )$ , skill ( $\mathrm { T } = 0 . 6 0 2$ $\mathfrak { p } = . 5 5 4 \AA .$ , and language $\mathbf { \Psi } ( \mathbf { t } = 0 . 9 8 3$ $\mathbf { p } = . 3 3 7 )$ between the pretest and posttest. Furthermore, a slight decrease of the presentation scores in the posttest for the control group is manifested in content, skills, and language.

# 3.3. Student perceptions towards the gesture instruction

Two semi-structured interviews were conducted with student volunteer from the experimental group for their perceptions on the effectiveness of classroom gesture instruction, with excerpts from Student 1 and 2 presented below. The firs interview focused on students' gesture habits and their opinions on gesture intruction before our pedagogical activities. It is shown that students were initially unaware of their gesture production when giving academic presentations and faled to regard it as an important communicative strategy.

# Excerpt 1 (Student 1, Interview 1, Week 3)

I produce gesture unconsciously and I dont know how gesture could be categorized following some criteria. In academic presentations, I often produce the same kind of gestures with up-down hand movements or just point to my power-point slides rather than produce gestures with rich forms.   
Excerpt 2 (Student 2, Interview 1, Week 3)   
Id say that Isedom produce gestures in academic presentations and I always fel nervous. I would produce gestures more frequently While talking with my friends in daily conversations, so I'm considering whether the personality traits may affect my gesture use. I'm eager to learn gesture in this class.

The second interview sought to inquire about students perceived changes on their gesture production and their feedback about the gesture instruction t was found that students leaned to produce meaning-enhancing gestures with different types and forms as an aid to express scientifi deas in academic presentations, showing that classoom gesture instruction raised their gesture awareness and improved their gesture skills.

# Excerpt 3 (Student 1, Interview 2, Week 9)

After the instuction, tined concrete reliztions of geture skill in communctive behavior ecill n acadmic ontext. would now practice diffent ype of getures before makig ademic prentionsoht could prce semantiy meningful gtures to strengthen the speech persuasion, but there are stil some problems while I produce salient gestures such as metaphorics.

Excerpt 4 (Student 2, Interview 2, Week 9)

Now I understand there are different types of gestures and they perform interesting functions in specific contexts. I think producing diffent tes f gture is relly helful for me to expres complicate scientifi des nd interact wth the audence. relly appreciate the gesture knowledge I received from the teacher and the opportunity to practice with my clsmates. And now I would practice gesture use consciously and make preparations in advance for effective presentations.

These excerpts showed that our students gradually engage in embodied gesture learning and started to use apropriate gestures intentionally to convey scientific thoughts and engage their audience, an indicative of their cognitive development, enhanced academic literacy, and conscious participation in the science community.

# 4. Discussion

This study assses the effectiveness of AT-informed gesture instruction on enhancing Chinese intermediate leaners academic presentation performance. Generally consistent with prior research that gesture can boost speech performance (Alibali et al, 2017), our study extends the current inquir by highlighting the relative efficacy of gesture instruction on L2 students' academic presentation performance and thus confirming the teachability of gestures in EAP classrooms.

4.1. Effects of classroom gesture instruction on students' gesture production in academic presentations

In the present study, the intermediate L2 learners who received classroom gesture instruction developed an awareness of gesture use when giving academic presentations, gesticulated more frequently and appropriately afer explicit classroom gesture instruction, and consciously applied specific gestures to deliver scientific thoughts and connect with the audience (Hyland, 2010), lending empirical evidence for the teachability of gestures in EAP context (Carney, 2014; Gullberg, 2006). Moreover, informed by the classoom activity system (Pena-Ayala et al., 2014) which views teachers as supportr and facilitator during the entire gesture in. struction proces, gesture's mediating function in language performance and students embodied engagement in the community could be motivated (Fujioka, 2014). Chinese intermediate learners' learning, practice, and production of gesture partly transformed them as being capable to modulate their gestural behaviors during academic presentations. However, compared with international students, Chinese intermediat leaners stil have difficulties in flexibly producing gestures in oral discourse (So, 2010) for illustration and persuasion purposes. As shown in our data, they are stil not used to producing a chain of gestures integrated with the thematic contents of speech to develop their academic discourse cohesion as a whole. Such discrepancy could be attributed to the relatively short training period (i.e, 10 weeks) in which students esture awareness and practice could not be fully developed. Another possible reason concerns the cognitive burden from simultaneously producing speech and gesture. As our participants are mostly intermediate L2 learners whose main struggle is to develop L2 accuracy, complexity, and fluency in EAP setings, paying attention to gesture use while giving oral presentations may require their extra cognitive eforts to achieve the desired learning outcome.

While there is no existing research concerning the effctiveness of classroom gesture type instructions on academic presentations, the present study revealed that gesture instructions in EAP classooms can significantly enhance Chinese intermediate learners production of beats. In academic presentations, beats, an attention cue in semantic processing to signify the importance of certain information (Dimitrova et al., 2016), can be commonly used to assist speakers to appropriate speech segmentation and maintain the speech rhythm through reeated movements of hands (Igualada et al. 2017). The increase in beats ater classoom intruction could e explained by the fact that as two-phase hand movements (in/out, up/down) are frequently used in daily communications and could be easily acquired by L2 learners. The conscious beats production helps Chinese EAP students to stres certain words and phrases, and they could also serve as convenient regulators to present the ongoing word search process (Duncan, 1972).

Learners who received gesture training also produced metaphorics more frequently. As shown in our results, learners in the experimental group consciously used meaning-enriching metaphorics in academic presentations to show movement, relation, or in. ternal structure of a specific scientifi concepts, to engage their audience in the conceptual mapping from unfamiliar abstract thinking to visual familiarity. However, such improvement does not qualify them as effctive gesture users when compared with international 3MT presenters (see Appendix II). For example, our students used significantly fewer metaphorics to signify astract conceptual. zations through imagistic and tangibl hand movements. This may indicat difficulties involved in using gestures to crystalize abstract scientific concepts (Kwon et al., 2018); more importantly, this also suggests intermediate L2 learners' challenges in articulating abstract ideas in geeral, which could be possbly due to their lack of both language sills or metaphoric competence in L2. This challenge not only reflects the need to further rise Chinee learners metaphorics awarenes, but aso the need to improve their academic presentation skills in general.

No significant difference was found in deictics production between the control and experimental groups after gesture instruction and among the control, experimental and international 3MT groups either. In our study, deictics were used frequently to refer to speech-related highlighters in their power-point slides or make abstract references with their pointing fingers to catch listeners attention and to help listeners understand the speech contents through multimodal channels in which the semantic relatedness and temporal congruity are established to achieve communicative efectivenes (Morell 2018; Ruiz-Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2015). As reported in the first interview by Student 1, learners from both groups have already been able to aply deictics as an important presentation stratg to highlight th spech content irretive f our intruction, making the ffet of geturetraning inignficant

Genre-specific features could be an important factor for the non-significant improvement of iconics in this study because the students in both groups were required to introduce ther research mainly consisting f abstract concepts, leaving them limited rom for elaboration with concrete actions, shapes, or objects (Brown, 2015; So et al., 2013), which can be efectively presented by using iconics. Apart from that, mediation in the activity system may provide stil insufficient motivation for Chinese intermediate leners to fully engage in the classroom science community. Students tended to use more beats and deictics in academic discourse rather than produce representational gesture,such as iconics and metaphorics, to build images for listeners' beter comprehension, reflecting their still restricted ability to reach balanced unity of body and mind in academic communications.

4.2. Effects of classroom gesture instruction on students' academic presentation performance

Our study showed significant improvement of academic presentation scores by learners who received gesture instruction than those who did not, especially manifested in sub-scores on gesture use. This result is partly i line with Vila-Gimenez and Prieto (2020) who reported that training children to produce beats has greatly boosted their narrative performance in terms of speech fluency and narrative structure. The improvement in academic presentation scores may be, on the one hand, much influenced by gesture's mediating role (Sweller et al., 2020) to promote speech by reducing cognitive load and facilitating cognitive processes (Goldin-Meadow et al., 2001; Wilson, 2002). Serving as a window into the mind, gesture would allow the presenters to generate new ideas that might be difficult to emerge through a verbal format (Goldin-Meadow, 2000). Chinese intermediate learners embodied gesture practice may permit them to not only recal the speech content by encoding it into visuospatial forms and reflect on detailed infor. mation that is not directly accessible in speech, but also solve language problems.

On the other hand, apart from gesture's role in speakers thinking process, we see the effects of gesture on speech production and comprehension in the give-and-take interaction between the presenter and the audience. The slight improvement on content and language scores showed that our gesture instruction helped them beter deliver the academic content area and improve the language production as well. Previous research has suggested that encouraging gesture use contributes to longer and more fluent discourse and that people could establish mental representations corresponding to speech to enhance comprehension in gesture-accompanied conditions (Cravotta et al., 2019; Norris & West, 1993). The significant increase of beats after our gesture instruction helps speakers to make self-regulations and stes information to engage their isteners. The more frequent use of meaning-enhancing representational gestures such as iconics and metaphorics helps speakers to allocate mental resources to organize the visuo-spatial knowledge into smaller meaning units (Kita et al., 2017) which could, therefore, help deliver concepts easily accessble to listeners, especially while representing spatial relations and clarifying complicated ideas (Aussems & Kita, 2019; Beattie & Sale, 2012). Speakers' manual variations in their use of iconics and metaphorics to realize such representational discourse functions as to refer, characterize, or quantify would certainly signal to their listeners about the changing focus of the communicative situation. And deictic gestures can facilitate speakers to manage the listeners' attention to get their meanings quickly through a prominence effct. Taken together, it is the experiential knowledge on cognitive and semiotic values of different gesture types that yields students better presentation performance as a whole.

During the classoom gesture instruction, the activity system helped us conceptualize the instructor as the supporter and facilitator to create an embodied science environment for learners to modify their gesture use in EAP context, and to establish the mutually interdependent connections within the clasroom science community and between the body and the environment, presenting a different nature of instruction from the traditional one (Macedonia, 2019). Human body, considered as the perceiving subject, serves as both an external physical and an internal experientia structure The nature of gesture as a powerful body-based resource could make learning happen (Kita et al., 2017) through students' direct experience of social engagement rather than a mere mentalistic way of presenting abstract scientific concepts. In classroom academic presentations,sudents may establish conceptions of terminologies through bodily movement and perceptions to release the high information load and to orient the audience to the ongoing speech. Their gestures thus offer an additional available channel of information to complete the utterance and to engage their audience to comprehend their academic speech.

It should be noted that the slight improvement on presentation scores could be due in part to the relatively insufficient effrt and effect of the modied claroom mediation durin intruction, opening up possiilities fr further reeach to nterat students lived experience in EAP teaching. Another possible reason might be the dee-rooted cultural variables that may affect Chinese students tendencies of geture inertia in academic context compared with international 3MT speakers (Jiang & Wang, 2013; Kwon et al., 2018) For functional interactions with the academic community that constitute the environment, the activation of conscious bodily awareness in academic presentations should be an important pedagogical concern in the future.

# 5. Conclusion

To conclude, this study examined the effectivenes of classroom gesture instruction on enhancing Chinese intermediate EFL leaners academic presentation performance, confirming that gestures could be taught and learnt in pedagogical setings as a valuable semiotic resource in EAP teaching. We also found that lassroom gesture instruction contributes to learners significantly increased general gesture frequency and their use of beats for marking key contents and regulating themselves in giving academic presentations. They could consciously produce metaphoric to illustrtecomplicated ideas in spite of the insufficiency compared with that of intenational presenters in gestre frequency and flexibility. This study i limited in the rlaively small sample ize, and further studies are encouraged to expand the sample data for ataning a more holistic picture of classrom gesture instructions in EAP presentations. Moreover, impacts of ifferent teaching actvities and task complexity as wel as persoality traits and gender differences on students gesture production and language performance were not taken into considerations in our research. Further explorations are encouraged to take linguistic, sociological, and psychological factors into account when examining learners uptake of the gesture instruction.

Despite the limitations, our findings have several pedagogical implications. First, gesture introduction can be incorporated into EAP curriculum as a useful pedagogical resource for speaking to improve L2 learners' embodied awareness in academic presentation performance. By taking gesture into account, the meaning-enhancing reertoires can contribute to students' extension of cognition and flexible participation in academic community. In addition, the multimodal semiotic complexes, including gesture and speech, could help socialize L2 leaners into specific research fields, in which the mind, body, and the cultural artifacts are combined as a functional system and thus could be helpful for transmitting information in academic contexts.

On this ground, it i necessary to foster teachers body awareness to design teaching activities, such as academic presentations or narration tasks, to integrate their students body movements, such as gestures or other embodied experiences, into clarooms. EAP teachers, therefore, are advised to create flexible embodied gesture-encouraging classrooms as engaging science communities. It is highly recommended for EAP teachers to embed gestures into their teaching so as to promote interactions between the learners body and academic environment. For instance, to situate learners in immersive gestural contexts, through Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to bridgevirality with relity, wouldallow thm t use handtures frly and ogey inasthr motivation to speak with gesture, thus shedding light on gesture empowered with new technologies in interactive learning. We anticipate further explorations into instructed gestures in designing EAP curriculums.
