This study explores the relationship between pre-lecture reading compliance and lecture comprehension in English-medium instruction (EMI) settings. The primary objective of the research was to investigate the influence of pre-lecture reading compliance on English lecture comprehension, with a secondary aim of identifying factors influencing pre-lecture reading compliance. Data were collected from 258 Taiwanese EMI students in 17 courses. A PLS-SEM model utilizing data from 249 participants evaluated the impact of pre-lecture reading compliance on lecture comprehension, accounting for English listening ability, and examined the role of reading expectancy and value in reading compliance. Additionally, open-ended responses from all 258 participants provided insights into students' perspectives on factors affecting their reading compliance. Results indicate that academic listening ability had a large effect on lecture comprehension whereas the effect for reading compliance was small. Moreover, academic reading expectancy and value were identified as having only a small effect on pre-lecture reading compliance. Further consideration of EMI reading compliance among EMI instructors and researchers is recommended.

# 1. Introduction

Students worldwide are increasingly required to take university courses through English-medium instruction (EMI) to obtain their degrees despite English not being the majority language in the university's host country (Dafouz & Smit, 2023). As a concrete example of the rapid growth of EMI, at my university in Taiwan, $5 0 \%$ of sophomores will be expected to take $5 0 \%$ of their courses through EMI by 2030, more than double the $2 0 \%$ target expected in 2024 (Ministry of Education, 2021). One of the major concerns among scholars regarding EMI is whether using English as a medium will negatively impact student academic outcomes (Macaro et al., 2017). The increase in EMI courses has been accompanied by an increase of accounts from EMI students struggling, mainly due to English pro ficiency (Aizawa et al., 2023; Kamasak & Sahan, 2023; Shepard & Rose, 2023; Xie & Curle, 2022). Ideall, students would only enrol in EMI courses once they have reached an adequate English proficiency level. Yet, in many contexts, the reality is that students may choose (or may be forced) to enroll in EMI courses without regard for their proficiency.

EMI instructors have ittle control over who enters their class and at what proficiency level, so the question becomes how in. structors can best support students' EMI learning diffculties. One area that has been underexplored in EMI contexts is the role of prelecture reading in supporting lecture comprehension. Pre-lecture reading is ofen thought to be a prime medium for exposing students to subject background and academic discourse before a lecture (Gorzycki e l., 2020; Manarin, 2019). However, these often-assumed benefits are undermined when students do not complete reading assgnments (Botha, 2013; Gorzycki et al., 2020; Pecorari et al. 2012). The challenge of ensuring pre-ecture reading compliance is likely discouraging to instructors and researchers alike, but it is a challenge deserving further attention. Considerig these gaps and challenges, this article investigates pre-lecture reading compliance and its relationship to lecture comprehension.

# 1.1. Assumed benefits of pre-lecture reading

Pre-lecture reading has traditionally taken a central position in university courses (Pecorari e l., 2012), valued for it assumed potential to build student background knowledge and introduce students to academic vocabulary before a lecture (Gorzycki t al., 2020; Manarin, 2019). In EMI contexts, Macaro (2018) speculated that \*sound [background] knowledge of the topic area helps students to overcome deficiencies in linguistic knowledge" (p. 106). Raising students background knowledge before a lesson is a commonly recommended strategy for supporting English language learners in pre-tertiary academic subjects (Chamot, 2009; Eche. varria e al., 2017). Unfortunatel, considerably les research exists on background knowledge in EMI tertiary education (Macaro et al. 2017). In terms of academic language ability, vocabulary rather than overallproficiency has been identified as the primary issue affecting students EMI lecture comprehension. For example, Shepard and Rose (2023) found first-year EMI students' challenges were primarily relatedto lower levels of vocabulary and familiarity with academic terms, while Masrai et al. (2022) identified vocabulary knowledge as a stronger predictor of EMI suces than overal language abilit. Thus, if pre-lecture reading helps students build background knowledge and academic vocabulary before the lecture, as is often proposed, then students may experience fewer lecture comprehension challenges.

# 1.2. Reading compliance

However, pre-lecture reading can only potentily support students in overcoming overall English proficiency challenges if students actually comply with the assinment Unfortunately, previous research has shown low compliance rates across 1 and EMI tertiary contexts (Botha, 2013; Gorzycki t al., 2020; Pecorari e al., 2012; Ward, 001). Botha (2013) reported on a university in Macau where only $5 5 . 4 \%$ of students in management and administration, $5 9 \%$ in hospitality and tourism, and $3 4 \%$ in information technology reported reading most or all of heassigned English texts. Those numbers are higher than those reported by Pecorari et al. (2012), where only $2 5 \%$ of undergraduate students in Sweden surveyed by the researchers had completed the assgned English reading for cass. Ward (2001) provided a more nuanced picture of the situation, finding that $7 6 \%$ of Thai engineering students read the text superficially, while only $2 0 \%$ reported reading the text in detail.

Researchers have suggested several reasons for low compliance rates. Eriksson (2023) found that Swedish students viewed English reading as to challenging, mainly due to English ability or length of the reading. Data presented by Botha (2013) and Ward (2001) point to similar sentiments among Asian EMI students. Busby and Dahl (2021) reported slower reading rates though similar comprehension for Norwegian students compared with their UK counterparts (including L1 and L2 English users), posibly pointing to contextual differences (i.e., EMI's non-immersive context). However, Pecorari et al. (2012) identified a separate issue: students perceived textbooks s altenatives, rather than complements to lectures and preferred learning solely through lectures and lecture notes (p. 235). In other words, students did not see pre-lecture reading assignments as needed for learning and, thus, viewed compliance as optional.

# 1.3. Expectancy-value theory

Based on the above literature, reading compliance appears linked to students perceptions of pre-lecture reading as achievable and worthwhile for learning. Thus, expectancy-value theory may provide an explanation for understanding and targeting reading compliance (Wigfield & Eccles, 200). The theory posits that a person's action is determined by their perceived expectancy of succes and the value they see in the task. Applied to reading compliance, a student may assess the following when assigned reading:

1. [Expectancy] Can I successfully complete this reading assignment?   
2. [Value] Do I believe reading this is valuable or useful?

To leverage this theory in EMI, instructors would need to select pre-lecture readings that students can read independently. A potential argument against this is that assgning les advanced texts may be detrimental to course outcomes. However, if students are incapable of reading theadvanced text before a lecture, then the text provides no benefit for lecture preparation. Once an appropriate text has been selected, instructors should then ensure that the text provides value for student learning and, perhaps more importantly, that students acknowledge this value.

# 1.4. Current study

Based on the above literature, two central hypotheses seem to emerge: first, that pre-lecture reading can support M learners aove and beyond language proficiency, and second, that expectancy-value theory can explain pre-lecture reading compliance. However, neither of these hypotheses has been empirically investigated for EMI. To address this gap, this study examines these hypotheses, guided by the following research questions:

1. To what degree does pre-lecture reading compliance contribute to lecture comprehension above and beyond English listening proficiency?   
2. To what degree do reading expectancy and value contribute to pre-lecture reading compliance?   
3. To what factors do students attribute their EMI reading compliance?

# 2. Materials and methods

This study utilized a concurrent mixed methods aproach. Further details on the study's setting, participants, measure, and data analysis are provided below.

# 2.1. Setting and participant recruitment

This study used data collcted from a national universty in northern Taiwan. The university was selected since it is rapidly increasing EMI courses to mee the EMI course targets of the Program on Bilingual Education for Students in College, known locally as the BEST program (Ministry of Education, 2021). At the time of the study, the university offred 264 EMI courses i the first semester and 277 in the second (not including English department and language courses).

A purposeful random sampling strategy was implemented in selecting courses for participant recruitment. The strategy was pur. poseful in that participants were selected in courses from each of the following disciplines, corresponding to the university's collges: arts, business umanities, physical education, social science, and ST (science, technology, eninering, mathmatics). Prior to the beginning of each semester of data collection (two semesters in one academic year), a course list was downloaded from the university system, and random courses from each discipline were selected in line with the resources available for this study. Course instructors were contacted by email and asked if() they assigned pre-lecture reding to students and b) they were willing toallow recruitment in their class Though it was found that many courses did not mee the criteria (mainly critrion (a), at least one course from each of the disciplines was included, giving a total of 17 courses (Table 1).

From these 17 courses, data were collected from 258 participants across two semesters during the academic year 2022-2023. The median EMI course size was 15 students. Among these 258 participants, 25 took an EMI course in the arts, 5 in business 42 in hu. manities, 16 in physical education, 141 in the social sciences, and 29 in STEM. In the third week of the respective semesters, prospective participants were provided an introduction to the study and asked to provide their informed consent. Participants providing consent were sent digital questionnaires in weeks 4, 6, 11, and 12 of the participating semester, two times before the midterm and two after.

# 2.2. Measures

This study used four questonnaires o collect quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data were olected for five constructs used in the study: lecture comprehension, reading compliance, academic listening abilit, reading expectancy, and reading value. In addition, qualitative data were collected using an open-ended question inquiring about factors related to pre-lecture reading compliance. Details on the five constructs are provided in the following sections.

# 2.2.1. Lecture comprehension

Lecture Comprehension was measured four times throughout the semester, twice before and twice after the midterm, to account for differences in lecture comprehension that may occur during acourse. The construct was measured through a single question taken

from Siegel's (2020) study:

1. How much of the teacher's English did you understand today?

Participants provided a percentage number (0-100) to indicate their perceived lecture comprehension. These responses were then distributed into score groups of 1-4. The researcher set the following cut-off ased on the work of van Zeeland and Schmit (2013):

1. Inadequate comprehension $( 0 - 6 9 \% )$   
2. Major comprehension difficulties $( 7 0 - 7 9 \%$ -   
3. Some comprehension difficulties $( 8 0 - 8 9 \% )$   
4. Adequate comprehension $( 9 0 - 1 0 0 \%$

As lecture comprehension was a formative construct in the model using scores from Question 1 at the four time points, variance inflation factor (VIF) values $( < 5 )$ and indicator weights $_ { ( \ge 0 . 5 ) }$ were checked to evaluate the construct before analysis based on criteria from Hair et al. (2021). All vIF values were below 5 (Time $1 = 3 . 4 0$ , Time $2 = 2 . 9 4$ , Time $3 = 2 . 3 2$ , Time $4 = 2 . 0 4 $ , indicating no collinearity isues (i.,each provides distinct information to the construct). Indicator loadings were all above 0.5 (Time $1 = 0 . 9 2$ , Time $2 = 0 . 9 6$ , Time $3 = 0 . 7 5$ , Time $4 = 0 . 6 2$ , suggesting each contributed sufficient information to the construct.

# 2.2.2. Academic listening ability

English academic listening ability was measured using the lingustic components and prosody subsection of the academic listning self-rating questionnaire (Aryadoust & Goh, 2017) and was administered at the beginning of the semester.

The questionnaire asked participants to rate statements on a 4-point scale: not at all well, not well, wll, and very well. ryadoust et al's (2012) validation study presented evidence of the measure a reliable and valid, providing preliminary support for it us inthe current study. Factor loadings and Cronbach's alpha statistics were examined to determine the measure'srliability for the current sample. One factor loading was found to be extremely low, indicating the particular item (Question 8; Aryadoust & Goh, 2017) had a weak relationship with the overall construct and was removed. After removing the question, the remaining factor loadings were above 0.7, providing evidence of the measure's reliability. Additionally, Cronbach's alpha was calculated $\mathbf { \check { \Phi } } ( \mathbf { \check { x } } = 0 . 9 4 $ ), further supporting the reliability of the instrument. Evidence of the instrumentsvalidity was established by examining average variance extracted (AVE) and heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) values, which were found to be above 0.50 and below 0.85, respectively (Hair et al., 2021)

# 2.2.3. Reading compliance

Pre-lecture reading compliance was measured four times throughout the semester, together with the lecture comprehension construct described above. rior to data collection, it was verified that the included courses allassigned pre-lecture reding at each of the selected time points. Participants were asked to rate their reading compliance on a 5-point scale and provide an explanation for their response. The questions appeared as follows:

1. Did you read the assigned reading for today's class?.

1. No, I did not read any of the assigned readings or I didn't know there was an assigned reading.   
2. Yes, I superficially read some sections of the assigned reading but did not read the other sections at all.   
3. Yes, I superficially read the entire assigned reading.   
4. Yes, I thoroughly read some sections of the assigned reading and superficially read the other sections.   
5. Yes, I thoroughly read the entire assigned reading.

2. What influenced your choice to read or not read the assigned reading for today's class?

As reading compliance was formative construct using score from Question 1 at the four time points, the variance inflation factor (VIF) values and indicator weights were examined to evaluate the construct before analysis. Al VIF values were below 5 (Time $^ { 1 = }$ 1.91, Time $2 = 2 . 5 9$ , Time $3 = 2 . 0 0$ , Time $4 = 2 . 1 2 $ ), indicating no collinearity issues. Indicator loadings were all above 0.5 (Time ${ \bf 1 } =$ 0.90, Time $2 = 0 . 9 2$ , Time $3 = 0 . 5 8$ , Time $4 = 0 . 6 3$ , suggesting each contribute a sufficient amount to forming the construct.

# 2.2.4. English academic reading expectancy and value

English academic reading expectancy and value were measured using questions adapted from the Isakson Survey of Academic Reading Attitudes ISARA Isakon et al., 2016, Table 3), adinistered at the end f the smester. Ths std utilized two of the orinal questionnaire's three constructs: (1) academic reading self-efficacy (reading expectancy) and (2) academic reading value.

Participants rated statements using  5-point scal from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The original wording in the questionnaire was slightly adapted for this study. First, wording was added to specify that students should answer the questions about the specific EMI course Second, the questions were revised to explicitly refer to English academic reading rather than academic reading in general.

The validation study conducted by Isakson et al. (2016) reported adequate reliability and validity for the instrument. To further examine the reliability wit this study's sample, factor loadings were first examined. ll loadings were at or above the 0.70 threshold except for three items for reading value. Hair et al. (2021) recommended that when a loading is below 0.70 but above 0.40, of which ll three items were, researchers should carefully consider whether removal is appropriate. In light of Isakson et al's (2016) previous validation of the instrument, it was decided that removal would not be appropriate, and the items remained in the model. The

Cronbach's alpha for reading expectancy was 0.90 and for reading value 0.83, further providing justification for maintaining the three items and demonstrating the rliability of the instrument. Both reading expectancy and reading value had average variance extracted (AVE) and heterotrait-monotrait rtio (HTMT) values above 0.50 and below 0.85, respectively, providing evidence for the validity of the measures.

# 2.3. Data analysis

All quantitative analyses were conducted using R. To address the first and second research questions, a partial least squares structural equation model (PLs-sEM) was run using the seminr package. The model, visualized in Fig. 1, contained two endogenous variables, lecture comprehension and reading compliance, and three exogenous variables, academic listening ability, reading expectancy, and reading value. Lecture comprehension and reading compliance were formative constructs, whereas academic istening ability, reading expectancy, and reading value were reflective construct.Variance inflation factor (VIF) values were examined for the model's variables, and all were below the threshold for collinearity.

Prior to analysis, the data were examined for missing values, revealing $1 5 . 6 \%$ of the data missing. Complete data were collected from 123 participant, while the remaining participants were missing between 1 and 31data points. Mising values were alla result of non-response to the questionnaire during the study, with possble explanations including student absence from class, questionnaires redirected to email spam folders, or participant unwillingness to complete the questionnaire during the respective week. Nine participants were missing complete questionnaires from Time 1 and Time 4, meaning complete missingnes for academic listening abilit, reading expectancy, and reading value. Due to excessve missingness, these nine participants were removed from the PLS-sEM model data set, though their data were included for descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis. Mising values in the remaining data set of 249 participants were imputed by classfication and regression trees using the mice package, and the resulting imputed data set was used for the PLS-SEM model. To assess the model, I adopted the Hair et al. (2011) benchmark for the $R ^ { 2 }$ statistic-small 0.25, medium 0.50, and large 0.75--and the Cohen (1988) guidelines for $f ^ { 2 }$ effect size-small 0.02, medium 0.15, and large 0.35.

Open-ended responses from the EMI pre-lecture reading compliance questionnaires were analyzed qualitatively using a multicycle approach described in Miles e al. (2020).All responses were compiled into a spreadshee for coding and analysi efore analysis. Inthe first cycle, responses were read and assigned descritie codes by the author. When response reresented multiple ideas, the responses were split into multiple rows and coded separately. This resulted in 725 response segments asigned 20 codes. In the second cycle, these codes were grouped into six themes, and data were reviewed to ensure theme compatibilit. After confirming the themes, a research asstant coded the data using the themes, and interrater reliabilit (percentage) between the author and research assistant was $7 8 \%$ Disagreements were reviewed and resolved by the raters. During this review stage, it was revealed through discussion that most discrepancies resulted from adjacent themes. Therefore, several themes were combined, leaving the final theme count as four. These four themes were applied, and data were reviewed one final time by the author to ensure accuracy.

# 3. Results

Descriptive statistics for the four constructs in the model are reported in Table 2. In terms of pre-lecture reading compliance, MI students in the sample self-reported reading before lectures across the semester, but superficially rather than thoroughly. Fig. 2 provides a visual of how reading compliance was distributed across the four time points. Non-compliance ranged between $1 4 \%$ (Time

Compared to other studies in EMI contexts, the reading compliance rates among students in this study were generally higher (Botha, 2013; Gorzycki et al., 2020; Pecorari et a. 2012; Ward, 2001). The percentage of students who self-reported as doing at least some pre-lecture reading ranged from $7 3 \%$ to $7 6 \%$ similar to the compliance rate reported in Ward (2001). However, with the exception of Time 1 where $1 9 \%$ reported thoroughly reading the entire text, between $2 8 \%$ and $3 5 \%$ of students read thoroughly before the lecture, exceeding the full compliance rates in Ward's study.

Turning to EMI lecture comprehension, the data in Table 2 shows that, on average, students self-reported moderate to major comprehension dificulties.This finding aligns with previous research documenting EMI student dificultie in Taiwan (Hua, 2019; Huang, 2012; Yeh, 2014), and globally (Aizawa et al., 2023; Kamasak & Sahan, 2023; Shepard & Rose, 2023; Xie & Curle, 2022). This finding onEMI lectre comprehension difficulties is despite participants self-rporting before ntering the EMI course a generally good ability (academic listening ability median of 3 on a scale of 4) in comprehending English academic discourse.

Finally, Table 2 reports the descriptive satistics for the remaining two construct, reading expectancy and value. Statistics showed that participants self-reported slightly positive views for both constructs. This provides a somewhat more positive picture of student expectancy and value toward reading than has been reported in other tertiary setings (Gorzycki e l., 2020; Pecorari et al., 2012).

# 3.1. RQ1: Contribution of reading compliance to lecture comprehension

The first research question targeted the effect of reading compliance on lecture comprehension (dependent variable), controlling for English academic listening ability. A total of $5 0 . 4 \%$ $\textstyle ( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 5 0 4$ , Adjusted- $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 5 0 0 )$ variation in English lecture comprehension was accounted for by pre-ecture reading compliance and English academic listening ability together. The estimated path cofficient for pre-lecture reading compliance was 0.19 ( $9 5 \%$ CI [0.09, 0.29]), indicating a rise of one standard deviation in pre-lecture reading compliance is predicted totranslat to0.19 tandarddeviation increase n EMI lecture comprehension when controlling for academic listening ability. The effect size $( f ^ { 2 } )$ for pre-lecture reading compliance was 0.06, a small effect. This effect was considerably smaller than that of English academic listening ability $( f ^ { 2 } = 0 . 6 5$ , large effect), which accounted for a greater amount of the variation in English lecture comprehension. In sum, the model found that a student's academic listening ability has a farly substantial impact on lecture comprehension, aligning with previous research (Aizawa et al., 2023; Kamasak & Sahan, 2023; Shepard & Rose, 2023; Xie & Curle, 2022). Despit it comparatively leser impact, reading compliance yilded a mesurableffct that could justify further consideration.

3.2. RQ2: Contribution of reading expectancy and value to pre-lecture reading compliance

The second research question investigated the effect of expectancy and value on pre-lecture reading compliance (dependent variable). These two constructs accounted for $2 3 . 3 \%$ $( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 3 3$ , Adjusted- $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 2 7 )$ of variation in pre-lecture reading compliance. The estimated path coefficient for reading expectancy was 0.36 ( $9 5 \%$ CI [0.19, 0.50]), indicating a rise of one standard deviation change in expectancy is predicted to translate to a 0.36 standard deviation increase in EMI pre-lecture reading compliance when controlling for value. For value, the estimated path was smaller, 0.16 ( $9 5 \%$ CI [0.01, 0.33]). This suggests that a rise of one standard deviation change in reading value is predicted to translate to a 0.16 standard deviation increase in EMI pre-lecture reading compliance when controlling for reading expectancy. The effect size $( f ^ { 2 } )$ for reading expectancy was 0.08, a small effect, and 0.02 for reading value, which, as aresult of rounding i at the threshold for consideration as a small ffect. In sum, when astudent has a stronger belief that they can successully read the text and acknowledge the benefits of alotting time to reading, they are more likel to comply with the pre-lecture reading assignment. However, the impact was small which raises questions about what other factors may have a greater effect on compliance.

# 3.3. RQ3: perceived factors related to pre-lecture reading complianct

Fig. 3 shows the counts for the four themes identified in the qualitative data affecting pre-lecture reading compliance across the four time points. Throughout the first three time points, the order of frequency remained consistent; however, time availability and class-related factors switched at th fourth time point, possibly due to participant atrition. Among these four themes, time availability and text-related factors were associated with expectancy, and classrelated factors with value. The final theme, student personal factors, was considered an additional factor beyond expectancy-value.

The most common theme, time availability, was related to students' perceived availabilit to complete the pre-lecture reading in relation to their other commitments. The responses in this theme fellinto three categories: general statements about time (e.g., \*no time to read carefully), statementsrelated to courseload (e.g., \*assignments or reports in other courses are also very heavy") or statements about non-academic commitments (e.g., "last wee I had my part-time job). The second most common theme was clss related factors. The responses in this theme ell into three categories: perceived usefulnes (e.g., \*afer finishing the reading, I can better understand what the professor explains in class"; \*failure to complete has ittle impact on understanding the content of the class), grade-related factor (e.g., there will e a quiz), and personal academic achievement (eg, "[reading is] the duty of being a student). The third most common theme was tex-related factors. This theme included issues related to tex-length (e.g., \*umber of pages"), content difficulty (e.g., \*hilosophy is dificul o red), language (e.g., ause my Eglis is very bad, I half understand and half dont), and topic interes (e.g., \*This time the theme is more interesting"). The final and least common factor was student personal factors. This encompassed two main areas: student mental/physical health (e.g., \*tiredness') or self-discipline (e.g, "procrastinated").

# 4. Conclusions

This study was driven by two under-investigated hypotheses derived from previous literature. The first hypothesis was that a relationship exists between EMIstudents' pre-lecture reading compliance and lecture comprehension, above and beyond the efect of English language proficiency. The results show that academic litening ability gretly affected lecture comprehension, while reading compliance only had a small ffect. One reasonable conclusion after seing the large efect of academic listening ability on lecture comprehension would be that universities must ensure students enter EMI courses with sufficient academic listening abilities and provide support programs for those who nee trengthening in these kills. Along the same lines, a quick look at the model may lead to the conclusion that reading compliance had only a smal efect on lecture comprehension and thus is not worth further consideration.

However, Plonsky and Oswald (2014) encouraged researchers to consider other factors beyond small medium, and large label. when interpreting ffect sizes. One such factor was the ability to manipulate the variable in real life. On this point, we must acknowledge that manipulating the academic listening ability of students in an EMI course would require substantial external re source (e.g, remedial courses, asessment stems) outside most EI instructors contrl. However assigning pre-lecture reading and encouraging students to comply is far more within the control of an EMI lecturer than academic listening ability.

Fig. 3. Theme counts for responses on factors affecting pre-lecture reading compliance.

While the efect of pre-lecture reading was classfied as small it should not be considered negligible. To provide a hypothetical example of is importance, we will consider student a the 50th percentile (asuming a normall distributed class. If we moved this student, presumed not to read at all(score 1 on the reading compliance measure), to superficially read most of the assigned reading (rise of approximately 1.5 on the scale based on the study's reported SD), then that student would move up to approximately the 58th percentile. As an EMI instructor, I believe ths result, though nominal, warrants the effort to assign and encourage reading. As a professional development failitator, I belie this also justifies encouraging my colleagues to exert simila effort, particularly given my experience recruiting for this project, where few reported assigning pre-lecture reading.

Nevertheless the issue persists: i is not merely about assining reading, but rather about encouraging compliance with the reading assignments. The second hypothesis driving thstudy, that expectancy and value would impact compliance,could only marginally be justified by the model. Theffects for both expectancy and value were small leaving most of the variation in compliance unexplained The qualitative data provided some insights into the factors impacting compliance, but more empirical work is needed in this regard. Despite this I contend that manipulating these factors to target compliance is well within the control of EMI instructors, even if the impact is small. The following section provides recommendations toward this end.

# 4.1. Pedagogical implications

Guided by the findings in this study, several suggestions are provided for EMI instructors to encourage reading compliance. In terms of reading expectancy, students reported length and text complexity as potentially discouraging their pre-lectre reading compliance. It is worth emphasizing the author's position that the role of pre-lecture reading is to prepare students for the lecture. If students ind the pre-e  incssbl tht is, nt tthtdnt's ndt eing leel, th it wllikely e n ineffeie o for lecture preparation. This may mean that standard English textboos typically assgned in L1 contexts may not be appropriate for prelecture reading in EMI context. Therefore, it is recommended that EMI instructors consider more acessble pre-lecture reading material or adapting the advanced materials. This should not be taken as arecommendation against using advanced disciplinary texts. Instead, these advanced texts may be better positioned elsewhere during students' learning progression, such as for post-lecture reading asignments. Such an arrangement would allow EMI students to use knowledge gained during the lecture to support their reading of advanced disciplinary texts. Future empirical research is recommended to investigate these sugested uses of reading texts and their impact on EMI learning.

EMI instructors have several options for curating appropriate pre-lecture reading material. Professional (non-academic) publications may be an excellent source. Authors of these publications natrally writ n a more aesible way while alo addressing the topic in a professonal manner. However, i i acknowledged that relevant professional publications may not be available or suitabl for all courses. When no such resources are available, an alternative is that EMI intructors create adapted versions of an advanced text for pre-lecture reading. Rets et al. (2022) provided guidance on aspects to consider when simplfying academic texts. Of course, EMI instructors may fin it chllenging toallocate time for this task.When this is the case, one optio is hiring ataching assistant for one semester to assist. Yet, it isacknowledged that this may not be feasible in many contexts. A second option may be using generative artificial inelligence (Al) platforms to asst with the task. Though, given the many unknowns surrounding these emerging technologies, instructors are advised to exercise caution if taking this sugestion until empirical investigation of these tools has ben conducted.

Instructors should also consider the time and workload challenges students face in EMI when considering pre-lecture reading expectancy. Whil some time availability isues were related to external commitments (e.g., part-time jobs), more often than not, the issue in this study was the demands of other courses. Busby and Dahl (2021) reported slower reading rae for students in EMI contexts, and instructors should take into account that students require more time for EMI than for L1 courses (Aizawa et al., 2023; Tatzl, 2011). EMI instructors have litle control over what other instructors do, but it may be worth having department-level conversations about how EMI impacts students overall workload and what this means for compliance acrosscourses. I instructors asign a lot of reading across a deartment and students do none f it this enefit no one. However, if al ageto assin managable redings across courses and students comply, this benefits all.

In terms of pre-lecture reading value, students reported being more inclined to read when there was a direct connection with the course outcomes, similar to accounts in Gorzycki e al. (2020) and Pecorari et al. (2012). More specifically, many reported grades, usuall through quizzes or assignments, as influencing their reading decisions. While instructors all want their students to be self-motivated and read for their own enrichment (some students in this study did), the vast majorit likely need value created through external means. To encourage higher rates of reading compliance, EMI instructors may want to pair readings with quizzes, discussion posts, or other assignments to encourage and assess reading compliance.

One final factor outside of expectancy-value for EMI instructors to consider is the impact of student personal issues on reading compliance. While this factor was the least mentioned among the qualitative data and is likely beyond the control of instructors it should not be ignored. EMI courses and the associated readings requre much effrt from students, arguably beyond that of L1 courses (Botha, 2013; Busby & Dahl, 2021; Erikson, 2023). If studnts are t physically and metll rdy for clas, oucomes willsuffr. It is outside the cope of this article to provide recommendations in this regard, but it is worth acknowledging that more discussion is needed around the personal student ssues that afect EMI student performance. The emerging reearch on emotions in EMI is a good start in that direction (Hillman et al., 2023).

# 4.2. Limitations

This study has several limitations that should be considered. First all data used in this study were self-reported. Future studies are encouraged to measure lecture comprehension and reading compliance through other means, such as lecture comprehension tests and computer-based aplications that ollect reading engagement metrics. Along similar lines, a single question was used for the lecture comprehension self-report. Though the question provided a direct way to inquire about students self-reported lecture comprehension, a validated questionnaire targeting the various dimensions of lecture comprehension could be developed and used in future studies. Second, the reading compliance questionnaire conflated the amount of reading completed (i.e. all, some, none) with the level of reading engagement (i.e, thoroughly, superficiall). Future studies should consider eliciting data on these two areas separately. Finally, future studies should consider examining other variables impacting comprehension, such as academic discipline and lecturer language use.

In conclusion, while this study of pre-lecture reading compliance cannot make any broad claims about the relationship between academic reading and lecture comprehension, it hopes to bring to the forefront the potential role that reading can play in "complementing" the learning in EMI lectures (Pecorari et al., 2012, p. 235). Further and more generally, it is hoped that the study may serve as a platform for future research to bettr guide EMI instructors in creating positive learning experiences for their students despite any pre-existing language proficiency barriers.It is believed that leveraging reading pre-lecture, during lecture, and post-lecture may serve to improve and enhance EMI student experiences, but only if students actually comply with reading assignments.
