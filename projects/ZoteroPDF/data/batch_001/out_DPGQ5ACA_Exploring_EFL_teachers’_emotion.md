Positive psychology   
EFL teachers   
Artificial intelligence (AI)   
Teachers' adaptive expertise (TAE)

The rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (Al) are reshaping language education, raising concerns about the professional future of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers. While existing literature often highlights the effectiveness of AI tools, it tends to overlook their impact on teachers' relevant expertise development and emotional experiences. This longitudinal study addresses this gap by exploring EFL teachers' emotional landscapes and adaptive expertise development through the lens of positive psychology. Employing thematic analysis, the study draws on data from three rounds of semi-structured interviews with ten EFL teachers, complemented by students' post-class reflections and classroom observations. The findings highlight the pivotal role of positive emotions in EFL teachers' professional development, revealing a dynamic, non-linear interaction between positive and negative emotions as teachers navigate AIintegrated language education. This emotional interplay is significantly influenced by teachers' social connections and professional backgrounds. The study underscores the need for institutional support systems that promote positive emotions and enhance teachers' digital literacy. By deepening our understanding of EFL teachers' emotional experiences and professional growth within the Al-integrated educational context, this study offers valuable insights for designing targeted interventions and curriculum reforms that foster effective collaboration between human and AI intelligence in global education.

# 1. Introduction

The advent of Generative Al instruments has significant implications for academia in general and language education specificall. Al technologies exhibit considerable potential in enhancing language acquisition and increasing productivity in educational settings. However, these advancements have also sparked intense debates about the potential negative impacts of generative Al on language teaching and learning. With recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and machine learning, AI has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in language-related tasks, establishing itself as an indispensable tool in translation (Tao & Wang, 2022) and writing (Han et a. 2024) practices. In some translation and writing contexts, Al-generated outputs can rival human performance Hu & Gao, 2024; Pack & Maloney, 2023). This has led to pressing questons such as, \*Willanguage teachers survive in an AI-dominated world?" (Downie, 2020), fueling widespread discussons without clear resolutions. Similar concerns, such as If AI isa language wizard, what value do I bring as an EFL teacher?" and "How can I coexist with AI i language education?" have become prevalent among EFL teachers, contributing to growing anxiety and pressure within the language education community.

Despite the challenges posed by the ris of Al, the development of these technologies also presents unprecedented opportunities for EFL teachers. Al tools have the potential to significantly enhance language teaching and learning by facilitating cross-anguage understanding and communication. Consequently, EFL teachers are now expected to not only master traditional language teaching methodologies but also to understand and integrate AI technologies into their teaching practices to drive innovation (Yuan, 2021). However, this transition exposes existing knowledge gaps and underscores the urgent need for research into strategies that can help EFL teachers navigate these changes. Specificall, there is a critical need to explore how teachers can mitigate negative emotions associated with Al integration and fostr positive emotions that will support them in adapting to the evolving landscape of language education.

While extensive research has focused on learner psychology, relatively les attention has been paid to understanding teachers psychological experiences (Dewaele et al., 2018; Lambert et a., 2023; Mercer et al., 2016). Recent scholarship has started to ill this gap, particularly in the area of teachers positive psychology (Greenier et al., 2021; Hiver & Dornyei, 2017). However, the adaptive significance of negative and positive emotions in this context remains underexplored. Specificall, more research is needed to understand how emotions help teachers not only \*survive" but also thrive" in their professional development in the era of Al (Castle & Buckler, 2009, p. 4).

This longitudinal study addresses the existing gap by exploring EFL teachers emotional experiences and TAE development from the perspectie f positive psychology. This proces reveals trajectories how teachers navigate chllenge and mitigat negative emotions associated with Al impact while fostering positive emotions that support their adaptation to the evolving landscape of language education and thrive in their professional development.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Studies on teachers' positive emotions

Positive psychology i the study of how individuals thrive and flourish, focusing on the strengths and virtues that contribute to well being (Csikszentmihalyi & Nakamura, 2011; Peterson, 2006; Seligman, 2011; Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). The origins of positive psychology can be traced back to Maslow (1954), who advocated for a balanced approach in psychology, noting that the discipline had been more successful in addressing negativeapects than positive ones. In this vein,Fredrickson's Broaden-and-Build Theory (2001, 2013) has been instrumental in distinguishing the adaptive roles of positive and negative emotions (MacIntyre, 2016; MacIntyre & Gregersen, 2012).

Fredrickson (2001, 2013) conceptualized the adaptive significance of both negative and positive emotions. While negative emo. tions serve to broaden an individual's momentary action repertoire, positive emotions have a broader impact over longer timescales. Fredrickson (2001) explained that the psychological broadening triggered by one \*positive emotion can enhance an individual's receptivenessto subsequent pleasant or meaningful events, leading to the accumulation of dditional positive emotions (p. 223). This broadened mindset isessential for the discovery of new knowledge, forming new allances, and developing new skill (Fredrickson, 2013).

It is well established that teachers' beliefs, thoughts, and emotions significantly influence their psychological well-being and resilience against burnout (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Liu, 2024; Zembylas, 2003). The exploration of teachers' emotional experi. ences, particularly within the context of second language acquisition (SLA), has expanded to encompass both negative and positive emotions (Fathi et al., 2023; Greenier et al., 2021; Hiver & Dornyei, 2017; Liu et al., 2024; Zhang, Fathi, & Mohammaddokht, 2023) The introduction of positive psychology into SLA marked a pivotal divergence from the focus on the psychological strains faced by teachers, such as burnout, emotional labor, and teaching anxiety (Ba0 et al., 2022; Benesch, 2017; Liu et al., 2022; Morris & King, 2018; Zembylas, 2003; Zhang & Zhang, 2023).

Recent literature on teachers' positive emotions has concentrated on two interconnected areas: Their impact on teachers' professional development and their inluence n students learning outcomes and classroom climate (De Costa et al., 2018).Gll (2016), in a longitudinal case study, highlighted the bidirectional relationship between positive emotions and teacher professional development, demonstrating their strong interconnection.

Several studies have further investigated the factors that foster positive emotions among EFL teachers, with a particular focus on resilince Riience, deined as the abilit to recover from adverst, is a ky oncet in postive psychlogy and has b extnsively studied in relation to language teachers (Connor & Davidson, 2003; Ergin & Dewaele, 2021; Gu & Day, 2007; Zhang & Fathi, 2024) For example, Liu and Chu (2022) examined the dynamics between resilience and positive psychology among senior high school EFL teachers in China, identifying a tri-factorial resiliencestructure consisting of tenacity, optimism, and coping style. This structure provides insights into the strategie FL teachers employ to navigate the demanding educational system in China. Building onthis iu and Chu (2023 studied the resilience of junior high school EFL teachers, adding factors such as professional competence, sociability, and grit to the reilience framework. These findings undercore the mulifacetd nature of resilience and its role in sustaning teachers professional performance and fostering positive emotions in challenging educational environments.

Studies on the impact of teachers' emotions on student outcomes, such as Dewaele and Li (2021), have shown that teacher enthusiasm is positively correlated with student engagement and negatively correlated with boredom. Studies accumulated supporting the idea that teachers emotional inelligce significantl nlunces classroom dynamics and stdent outcomes (Dwale et al., 2018; Ergtin & Dewaele, 2021; Deng et al., 2024; Resnik & Dewaele, 2020). Gabrys-Barker (2016) further linked teachers positive emotions to students' emotional and academic performance, suggesting a reciprocal dynamic between teacher and student emotions.

Aforementioned studies provide valuable insights into the relationship between teacher emotions and student outcomes; however, they primaril rely on quantitative methods, which may not full capture the complexities of emotional ineractions in the classroom. Qualitative research could offer deeper understanding of how these emotions are experienced and expressed in rel-time educational interactions. Furthermore, the iterature would benefit from a more nuanced exploration of the interplay between teachers' positive and negative emotions.

# 2.2. Teachers' adaptive expertise (TAE)

Hatano and Inagaki (1984) introduced the concept of adaptive expertise (AE) in contrast to routine expertise (RE). RE is described as the ability to execute established tasks quickly and preciely, whereas AE is better suited for addressing unfamiliar and novel challenges. Individuals with AE would dynamically emerge new methods based on their expert understanding (Holyoak, 1991), rather than just relying on pre-existing knowledge and skill. Those with AE are believed to grasp the underlying principles behind specific techniques, recognize their ffectiveness in certain situations, and know how to improve them dynamicall (Hatano & Inagaki, 1984; Salmon et al., 2020).

Teachers are viewed as adaptive experts potentially for they always facing with flexible and novel situation (e.g., Al, novice learners), and most of them are under severe pressure of performance appraial. Results of extant studies emphasized how TAE dynamical evolves within distinct ociocultural sttings amidst various shift. For example, Baldinger and Munson (2020) found that adaptive expertise elements can be shaped through interactions with peers and reflections on teaching experiences and perspectives.

Similarly, Smit et al. (2022) explored the concept of adaptive teaching by examining the intricate and fluid interactions between teachers and students in 16 English lessons. Their findings revealed that teachers instinctively adjust their instructional approaches and materials based on real-time classroom dynamics and student feedback. An EAP writing teachers TAE was explored by Xiang et al. (2022) and their results confirmed that TAE evolved, intertwined with teachers affective and social components, which are intricate and dynamic in nature as the complex dynamic systems theory (CDST) indicated (de Bot, 2015; Larsen-Freeman et l. 2024; Lee & Yuan, 2021).

Thus, in recent studies, teachers are viewed as self-regulating entities whose instructional sills evolve i response to the intricate and dynamic interplay of various factors, including their own negative and positive emotions, thesurrounding contexts, feedback from colleagues and students, and the broader influences of social environments. However, in the era of Al, lttl is known about the dy. namic development of teachers TAE, which would be explored in the current work, thereby making avaluable addition to the existing body of literature in the field of EFL education.

Recently, CDST and positive psychology are advancing side by side in the field of second language development (SLD), converging and promoting a dynamic and positive shift in this domain. CDST conceptualizes individual deelopment as a dynamic proces (Lowie, 2017), emphasizing dynamism and adaptation, and delineating emergent patterns that arise during individual developmental processe (Hiver & Ai-Hoorie, 2020). Accordingly, an increasing number of studies have adopted a dynamic perspective to examine the longitudinal development of EFL learners' individual differences variables (Chang & Zhang, 2023; Dornyei et al., 2015; Malczew. ska-Webb, 2016), considering them as intrinsic atributes of development. Comparatively, ittl is known about the dynamic devel. opmental characteristics of EFL teachers' positive emotions, particularly with a longitudinal tracking design.

# 2.3. The application of AI in language education

Technological advancements have significantly impacted the field of EFL education, particularly in the translation sub-field. The introduction of machine translation (MT) has profoundly reshaped the translation industry (Lee, 2023). However, this shift has not been adequately integrated into translation education programs (Chen & Liu, 2023). According to the 2022 European Language Industry Survey (ELIS Research, 2022) reported that over $8 0 \%$ of training institute representatives are struggling to meet industry expectations, with technology further exacerbating these challenges.

In China, a recent survey of the translation and language services industry revealed that $6 5 . 4 \%$ of respondents believe that translation and interpreting programs in tertiary education are ineffective and disconnected from industry realities (TAC, 2022) Despite the growing demand for professonals with strong instrumental competence in the language education, academic programs have been slow to respond effectively (Y. Gao et al., 2024; Massey, 2021).

The advent of l has sparked increasing interest in exploring its efectivenes in language education (R. Gao et al., 2024). However, research into how Al is being integrated into academic programs remains limited. As the intellectual and pedagogical backbone of these programs, translation teachers are expected to adapt to the emerging changes and needs within the field. Consequentl, there is a growing nedto understand the challenges faced by translation teachers, their emotional trajectories, and the tratgie they mploy to navigate these challenges (Chen & Liu, 2023; Massey, 2021). This highlights an urgent need for research into EFL teachers' perspectives and psychological responses to their profession, particularly in the context of Al-integrated education. Addressing these challenges could help mitigate the emotional and professional difficulties faced by EFL teachers in this rapidly evolving landscape.

In light of these considerations, the present study is grounded in the perspective of positive psychology and aims to explore the diverse developmental trajectories of EFL teachers' emotional experiences and adaptive expertise in the era of AI. Fredrickson's Broaden-and-Build Theory (2013) provides a valuable framework for this longitudinal study, enabling the examination of how positive emotions dynamicall evolve and influence teachers' adaptive expertise over time. The study was guided by the following research questions:

1) How do EFL teachers' emotions evolve in response to AI advancements?   
2) How do positive emotions contribute to the development of EFL teachers' adaptive expertise?   
3) What factors contribute to EFL teachers' positive emotions and TAE development?

The current work sees to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities EFL teachers confront with. Th findings would offer valuable insights for teacher education and pedagogical interventions in tertiary education, with potential im plications extending beyond China to a global educational context.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Research context

This study was conducted in Chinese mainland, where there is a significant shift towards digital literacy within the educational sector. Globally, the educational community is actively addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by digital trans formation, a focus underscored at the \*World Digital Education Conference' (2023) under the theme of "Digital Transformation and the Future of Education."'

The promulgation of the National Educational tandard Digital Literacy of Teachers" (MoE China, 2022) emphasizes that digital literacy is now a fundamental component of the modern teaching profession, alongside traditional pedagogical sills and the capacity for human-computer collaboration. This evolving role of teachers in the digitization of education reflects a broader trend towards integrating digital skills into educational practice.

In response, several Chinese universities have launched initiatives to promote interdisciplinary integration and cultivate inter. disciplinary talent. For instance, in 2024, institutions such as Fudan University and Yangzhou University introduced pioneering programs that integrate digital skill within language education currcula, including English-Computer Science and Technology" and Translation-Computer Science and Technology." These initiatives represent a significant advancement in educational reform, highlighting the increasing relevance of digital literacy within the contemporary educatio. As a resul, teachers are now required to enhance their digital and instrumental competencies to meet the demands of these evolving educational programs.

# 3.2. Participants

EFL teachers were recruited on a voluntary basis from four distinct Chinese universities, each offring English language programs and representing various educational contexts: A Technical Universt, aLiberal Arts University, and two Comprehensive Universities. Notably, at the time of ths study, these institutions had not yet implemented educational reforms relaed to digital transformation. A maximal variation sampling strategy (Creswell, 2015; Patton, 2015) was employed to ensure a diverse and heterogeneous sample of participants. This approach was chosen to capture multiple perspectives and addressthe complexity of the research questions by reflecting the varied impacts of educational digitalization at different levels.

The final sample consisted of ten EFL teachers (pseudonyms T1 . T10), al of whom were engaged in teaching translation, a field significantly impacted by AI advancements. These participants varied widely in characteristics such as age, gender, qualifications, translation experience, and the type of universty at which they were employed, as detailed in Table 1. Consent forms were obtained from all participants prior to the commencement of the study.

# 3.3. Instruments

# 3.3.1. Semi-structured interview with EFL teachers

Participants' emotional experiences were explored through semi-structured interviews, offering a flexible framework for guided conversation. This approach allowed participants to express their unique emotional experiences and perspectives in depth. This longitudinal study included three rounds of semi-structured interviews with ten EFL teachers involved in translation teaching. The interview guide consisted of open-ended questions informed by Fredrickson's (2013) Broaden-and-Built Theory. The focus of the questions varied across stages: Iitial stage mainly addressed comprehensive emotional experiences, mid-stage concentrated on the role of positive emotions in the development of TAE, and later stage focused on resilience in the context of AI advancements see Appendix).

# 3.3.2. Classroom observations

Classroom observations served as a crucial instrument for triangulating data from teacher interviews. These observations documented pedagogical activities in real-time, particularly in response to AI integration in translation teaching. The approach was structured yet adaptable, enabling detaled note-taking on teacher-student interactions and AI usage in the clasroom. Conducted longitudinall, these observations provided a comprehensive view of the evolution of teachers emotions and their professional development. This method corroborated and contextualized findings from teacher interviews and student reflections.

# 3.3.3. Student post-class reflections

Students' post-class rflections were used as a supplementary instrument for triangulation, alongside teacher interviews and classroom observations. These reflections captured students' perceptions of and experiences with Al instruments in the classroom. Students were prompted to reflect on their engagement, the effectivenessof Al instrument, and the teaching methods employed. This data provided insights into the impact of teaching practices from the learners' perspective, offering a valuable counterpoint to the teachers' narratives.

# 3.4. Data collection and procedures

Data colection spanned two semesters, approximately ten months in total. Prior to the formal commencement of the study, all participants were familiarized with the purpose and content of the research and signed informed consent. To enhance validity and address potential iases, both data source triangulation and method triangulation were employed (Denzin & Lincoln, 200). Primary data were collcted through three rounds of semi-structured interviews, each conducted by the second author. These interviews, lasting between 25 and $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , followed an outline provided to participants two days in advance, ensuring thorough preparation. Participants had the option to respond in either Chinese or English, and all chose Chinese. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis, with subsequent English translations completed by the authors.

Supplementary data were gathered from students' self-checks, practicum reflections, teachers' lecture slides, course plans, and classrom observations (T3, T4, T5). This multi-source approach contributed to a thorough understanding of each participant's professional and emotional experiences within their specific community, institutional, and social settings.

# 3.5. Thematic analysis

Thematic Analysis (TA) was employed to analyze the transcribed qualitative data from participants' interviews. TA is widely used in qualitative reearch for identifying, analyzing, and reporting pattens or themes within diverse data sets (Braun & Clarke, 2006). To ensure coherence and accuracy, coding procedures were meticulously conducted and cross-verified by both authors.

Adopting an inductive TA approach (Braun & Clarke, 2013), we commenced by thoroughly reading various qualitative data sources, including interview transcripts, student self-checks, practicum reflections, teachers' lecture slides, and course plans. Codes reflecting the content were derived from the data, then categorized and clustered to identif prevaing emotional themes across different interview rounds. This preliminary review allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the extensive data set.

Then, a deductive TA analysis was conducted, guided by Fredrickson's Broaden-and-Build Theory (2013) and our central research questions. Each episode of participants' emotional experiences was meticulously coded, informed by a coding system with two major dimensions and five sub-dimensions. Although guided by theory, the themes themselves emerged from the data, reflecting the unique emotional experiences of the participants. Consequently, theme names varied across diffrent stages (e.g., Developing Awareness, Expanding Awareness, Strengthening Awareness). This systematic aproach ensured that all relevant data related to participants emotional dynamics were captured and interpreted within the established theoretical framework.

Finall, the data were holisicll reviewed by the authors independently and collaboratively. All translations of quoted excerpts, findings, and discussions underwent a rigorous processof member checking and were confirmed by the respective respondents for accuracy and interpretive correctnes (Nowell e al., 2017). Through these various coding techniques, we illuminated the intricate and multifaceted nature of teachers' adaptive expertise.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Dynamic development and interplay of EFL teachers' positive emotions

This section illstrated the emotional experiences of EFL teachers in the context of AI-powered education, addressing the first research question by identifying various emotional themes through Fredrickson's Broaden-and-Build Theory (2013). The adaptiveness shown by participants in response to AI tools is detailed in the following three tables. Salient emotional themes identified from participants' experiences are marked with $\bullet$ less prominent themes with o, and themes not mentioned by participants are indicated with $\times$ .

# 4.1.1. Initial stage: characterized by broadening

According to Fredrickson's Broaden-and-Build Theory, Developing Awareness and Emotional Complexity emerged as the most prominent emotional themes (see Table 2), both reflecting a significant broadening effect. Participants exhibited an expansion in both cognitive and emotional capacities in response to Al technologies. This broadening not only heightened their awarenessof new tools but also evoked complex emotional responses, such as cautious skepticism, curiosity, and proactive engagement.

The second most frequent theme, Tentative Adaptivity, indicates strong broadening with potential building of personal resources Nine participants reported varying levels of interaction with AI instruments. Among them, some participants (T1, T2, T3, T6, T10) did not actively engage with AI tools; within this group, T1 and T2 expressed acautious attitude, while T3, T6, and T10 showed openness and curiosity about uture exploration The remaining five participants reorted feelings of excitement or joy during their experimental experiences with different AI instruments.

Findings from the initial stage highlight the prevalence of Emotional Complexity and Tentative Adaptivty among the participants, underscoring the dynamic processes of broadening and building as EFL teachers navigate their evolving relationship with AI. Their expanded awareness and emotional experiences contribute to the development of adaptive skils and resources, ultimately enhancing their ability to effectively integrate new technologies into their teaching practices.

# 4.1.2. Mid-stage: broadening with emerging building

Mid-stage data clearly demonstrate the processes of Broadening and the intial phases of Building (see Table 3). In the Broadening dimension, key themes such as Expanding Awareness and Increasing Creativity emerged,reflecting participants' enhanced cognitive engagement and creativity due to positive interactions with AI toos. The theme of Awarenes remained particularly prominent across both the initial stage and mid-stages, indicating a progressive understanding of AI instruments among participants.

Additionally, themes like Emotional Expansion and Enhancing Mood became more noticeable as participants reported feeling emotionally uplifted and positive through their AI experiences. The prominence of Adaptivity further suggests an increased capacity among participants to adjust to changes and challenges, highlighting the ongoing process of broadening their sills and perspectives. This broadening processalso paved the way for themes in the Building dimension to emerge, particularly the development of Resilience, enhanced Intellectual Abilities, and the building of Psychological Resources, allessential for professional growth.

Notably, the themes of Social Exploration in the Broadening dimension and Social Connectednes in the Building dimension gained significance during the mid-stage. These themes reflect the formation of tronger professional networks and support systems as participants engaged in broader social interactions, such as online training courses, forums, and following Al-related subscription a. counts. These interactions led to the improvements in their instrumental competence, increased optimism, and the development of supportie rlationshis within their rofessional ntworks. Themes such as Inellect Abilities, Emotiona Expansion ancing Moo, and Resilince were also prominent acordingly. These findings suggest that as participants navigated and adapted to their experiences with AI technologies, they are building durable personal and social resources that enhance their professional efficacy and wellbeing.

# 4.1.3. Later stage: Reinforcing cycles

Data from the later stage' emphasizing the Building process while also highlighting the enduring efects of Broadening see Table 4). The sustained prominence of themes such as Creativit, Emotional Erichment, Mod, and Social Expansion llustrate ongoing expansion of participants' cognitive and emotional capacities. This continuous broadening supports an evolving abilit to integrate new ideas and adapt emotionally to changes in the educational environment.

In addition to the enduring broadening, the Building dimension shows significant growth, particularly in the development of Personal Resources such as Resilince, Intelectudl Abilites, and Psychological Wellness These elements highlight the participants increasing capacity to adapt and thrive in the face of challenges. However, it is worth noting that Physical Health received less emphasis indicating variability in the impact of positive emotions on different aspects of participants well-being. The dynamic interplay between Broadening and Building is expected to continue as long as teachers encounter diverse situations, suggesting that their emotional and cognitive growth will persist beyond the scope of this study.

# 4.2. EFL teachers' adaptive expertise (TAE) in resilience with AI

Teachers exhibiting different patterns of TAE were clasified into three categories: Potential Engager, Progressive Engagers, and Productive Engagers, each characterized by specific features in their application of AI instruments in teaching practices.

# 4.2.1. Potential Engager

Potential Engagers demonstrated notable emotional variabilit, for example1 and T2, initially characterized by varying levels of resistance to AI, which gradually adapted into reduced negative emotions and increased openness to AI tools. Although these teachers did not personall use Al instruments in their teaching, they allowed or encouraged students to do so and expressed a willingness to consider using AI themselves in the future. T1, for example, voiced common concerns among translation EFL teachers:

There is widespread discussion about AI relacing language teachers, and I've noticed that some universities in our country have already slashed their translation programs. We've defintely sen a drop in enrollment. It makes me wonder-- What willwe do if we can't atract enough students in the future? [T1_initial stage]

The emotional adaptability of Potential Engagers was influenced by their interactions with students. For example, T1's understanding of AI expanded through student feedback, such as comments like, Al'stranslations sometimes ad extra information beyond the source texts" and "AI struggles with translating technical terms. These insights broadened T1's knowledge of AI and enhanced her self-worth and confidence, as reflected by T2:

After talking wth stdnts about  nd herin their thoughts n it, my axit ndrestance toward  hae ased ot. I tilleel that my role as a translation teacher is valuable and important. (T2_mid-stage)

The interviews suggest that Potential Engagers not only expanded their understanding of Al instruments but also enhanced their confidence and deepened their rlationships with students. These adaptations contributed to an overallimprovement in their psychological well-being and openness to future AI use.

# 4.2.2. Progressive Engager

Similar to Potential Engagers, Progressive Engagers initially did not use Al instruments but gradually became more open to AIintegrated education. By the later stage, they began integrating AI into thir translation education. Participants such as T3, T6, and T10, demonstrated increasing curiosity, creativity, and adaptability. T10, for example, noted:

I've watched some videos showing I creating beautiful poy from just  few simple prompts. It's amazing! I'mrely curious to see how it performs in translation. (T10_initial stage)

This strong cognitive awareness and flexibilit contributed to the expansion of their thought-action repertoire, leading to the building of their personal resources in TA By the mid-stage, Progresive Engagers' cretivity, adaptability, and intellctual abilities had significantly improved, leading to confident AI use in both personal and teaching contexts. T3 elaborated on their classroom activities:

I gave students a task to translate a paragraph from the famous Chinese novel The Story of Ming Lan ((AI) There's a culture-loaded expression Fa#atit.2 Here, Ftt (from 7pm to 9pm)is an ancient Chinese time division, so translating t was a bit tricky for the students. I encouraged them to explore its meanng using A ools and parall corpora. nteestingly, its translation includes first watch, the ell of hour, and the hour of the Dog. We kept interacting with I about the meanings of them and we eventually chose first watch' as the translation. (T3_mid-stage)

This example illustrates how T3 creatively guided students in acquiring new knowledge in translation activities by exploring lifferent perspectives using AI.

# 4.2.3. Productive Engager

Productive Engagers, represented by T4, T5, T7, T8, and T9, adopted AI tools from the initial stage, demonstrating consistent cognitive broadening that became more focused and refined as over time. The sustained acumulation of knowledge about AI in. struments facilitated creative thinking in its application. Productive Engagers broadened the scope of Al utilization, extending its use from teaching to research. Their research findings have implications on their teaching methodologies.

For example, T5 employed computational linguistics t assesstranslations produced by certain Al tools and mainstream translation software, concluding that Al is lesefective with technical terms but excels in language improvement. T5's research contributed to enhancing students' instrumental competence and selfefficacy by effctively utilizing a variet of tools. T5 referenced a Dean's remark:

In the future, $9 0 \%$ of translation tasks will be completed by software, but the crucial $1 0 \%$ 'the final mile', will need human effort. A1 won't replace human translators, but it will replace those who don't use AI. (T5_mid-stage)

Regarding the theme of Physical Health, interview data across al three categories were not prominent but revealed instances where participants felt refreshed and energetic, attributing this t stress reduction. For example, T4 stated,  passionately discuss the AI prompts with students in the classroom" (mid-stage). T5 added, \*T'm excited to explore the translations of Chinese culture-loaded expressions using Al tols with my students (mid-stage). These teachers' reflections indicate that the creative use of AI tools can reduce stres, foster positive emotions, and contribute to both psychological resilience and physical wellbeing. Overall, participants consistently adapted to the application of Al tools linking job satisfaction to their well-being and happiness albeit to varying degrees

# 5. Discussion

This section discusses finding of this study in relation to releant iterature, aiming to llustrat the non-inear delopment of ten EFL teachers' emotional experiences, adaptive expertise as they responded to the progressive integration of AI instruments. It specifically explores how positive emotions influence EFL teachers' professional development.

5.1. EFL teachers' emotional experiences: dynamic interplay between positive and negative emotions

The emotional trajectories of the participants revealed a dynamic interplay between positive and negative emotions, with distint manifestations obsered acrossthe stags. Inthe intil stage, participants frequenty rorted feelings of professional insecurity due to the uncertainties posed by AI. However, as the study progressed into the mid-stage and later-stage, participants, particularl Potential and Progressive Engagers, demonstrated increasing adaptability to AI. This adaptability was marked by a reduction in resistance and insecurity, facilitated by new knowledge about AI and the growth of positive emotions.

As negative emotions subsided, new concerns regarding AI's effctiveness emerged. Our findings align with previous research indicating that while negative emotions can hinder progress (MacIntyre & Gregersen, 2012), they also play a crucial role in fostering caution and promoting adaptive strategies during professional development (Fredricson, 2013; Komorowska, 2016; Resnik & Dewaele, 2020). These negative emotions, though challenging, serve an adaptive function by responding to environmental threats or challenges. Over time, positive emotions accumulated from new knowledge, forming alliances, and developing teaching skills miti. gated the lingering effects of negative emotions, contributing to long-term adaptation within the complex interplay of emotions. Fredrickson's (2013) concept f "upward spirals reflects this non-linear developmental process motivating EFL teachers to enhance their professional resources for thriving (MacIntyre & Gregersen, 2012).

These "upward spirals" varied among individuals, significantly contributing to the complexity of their positive emotional expe. riences (MacIntyre, 2016; MacIntyre & Gregersen, 2012). For instance, Productive Engager T4, who embraced AI tools early on, exhibited sustained cognitive broadening alongside positive emotions. However, as her engagement deepened, she became concerned about students' potential over-reliance on AI. To addres this T4 optimized her teaching strategies, focusing on strengthening students internalization of knowledge and reducing their dependence on Al. Her enhanced problem-solving abilities and adaptability allowed her to navigate these challenges effectively (Fredrickson, 2013).

Introducing positive psychology to SLA has revealed the complex interplay between positive and negative phenomena (Hiver & Dornyei, 2017; MacIntyre & Mercer, 2014). Our findings confirm that language teachers emotional experiences involve complex, sometimes conflictig elements. Negative emotions, such as fear or anger, can triger subsequent progress often manifesting later as delayed efects (Fredrickson, 2001; Seligman, 2011). Adopting a metatheoretical perspective that balances positive and negative processes is crucial for advancing the field beyond simplistc dichotomies (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Thus, a CDST perspective that engages with positive psychology is encouraged (Malczewska-Webb, 2016; Larsen-Freeman et al., 2024) allowing researchers and teachers to explore the multifaceted nature of human psychology in language learning and teaching.

# 5.2. EFL teachers' TAE: Positive emotion-empowered AI engagers

The complex interplay between positive and negative emotions was also evident in EFL teachers TAE development. For Potential Engagers, positive emotions mitigated the effcts of negative emotional arousal (MacIntyre & Gregersen, 2012), though they could not entirely counteract negative emotions (Resnik & Dewaele, 2020). In contrast, for Progressive and Productive Engagers, positive emotions often outweighed negative ones, promoting well-being and enhancing efectiveness in language education (Liu & Chu, 2023; MacIntyre, 2016). Teachers who experience more positive emotions are more engaged in their professional development, as prior positive emotions enhance receptivenessto subsequent pleasant or meaningful events, leading to the accumulation of positive emotions over time (Fredrickson, 2001; Gallo, 2016; MacIntyre, 2016).

For example, Progressive Engagers T7 and T9 initially observed inaccuracies in Al-assted translations due to the students ineffective prompts. To addres this, they conducted sessions on prompt engineering, which significantly improved both students translation competence and their proficiency with Al tools. This continuous adaptive process underscores how teachers positive emotions, such as interest in Al, can counterbalance concerns over students ieffectie use of A and contributto intlectl growth, including enhanced problem-solving abilities--an essential aspect of TAE (Zhang et al., 2003a).

In another case, Productive Engager T4 integrated Al-powered translation assessment and feedback into her course to addressher initial guilt over the inability to provide timely feedback to a large student cohort. This integration significantly enhanced students autonomous learning and self-efficacy in translation, while also bolstering T4's emotional development, evidenced by increased job satisfaction, enjoyment, and resilience (Zhang et al., 2003b). These improvements contribute to her professional growth as an EFL teacher.

As T4's course progressed, a new challenge emerged. T4 noticed that when processing AI-powered translation asessment and feedback, students primarily focused on linguistic aspects (g., word richnes, collocation, and cohesive devices) while paying lttle attention to elements like register and genre. In response, T4 involved students in co-constructing rubrics for AI-powered translation assessment. This collaborative approach provided students with a holistic understanding of translation asessment criteria and the functioning of Al-assted assessments, leading to further improvements in their instrumental competence. Throughout this proces,

T4s positive emotions -- such as interest in AI tools pride, and inspiration from her achievements in AI-asted translation practice.   
fueled her TAE development (Mercer et al., 2016).

T4's integration of Al tols into teaching and research llustrates the \*upward spiral of emotional traectories, characterized by cycles of "ste appraial, \*ositive reappraal" and \*ew stress ppraisal (Fredrickon, 2013). tres appraia triggers mmediate actions to addres new challenges, leading to the acquisition of new knowledge and skills Positive rappraial helps reduce working stress and fosters the development of phased positive emotions, such as job satisfaction and confidence ultimately building resilience. These upward spirals, combined with the accumulation of new resources, contribute to sustained adaptability in professional development, as evidenced by continuous engagement with Al, ongoing assessment of student performance, and regulated teaching processes (Fredrickson, 2013; Vaughn et al., 2020).

# 5.3. EFL teachers' professional development: Social networks and institutional support

Teachers social networks and institutional support are crucial for fostering positive emotions and enhancing TAE, particularl in the era of AI (Larsen-Freeman et al., 2024; Liu & Chu, 2023). Our findings lign with those of Liu and Chu (2023), highlighting the significant role of sociability in EFL teachers' professional development. Participants consistently emphasized the importance of expanding and strengthening their social networks. Different strategies were employed by Potential, Progressive, and Productive Engagers to broaden their social connections, contributing to professional growth. Classroom interactions with students and discussions with colleagues were primary srategies, especially among Potential Engagers. Progressve Engagers expanded their networks further by utilizing social media for professional exchanges.

Productive Engagers adopted a more multifaceted approach, actively engaging with AI-related educational platforms, participating in academic seminars and workshops (both online and fline), and enrolling in specializd training clases to enhance their Al skill. This diverse approach to social network expansion, typically adopted by experienced scholars with knowledge of corpus linguistics or computational linguistics, provided them with a distinct advantage in adapting to AI-oriented transitions in language learning and teaching (Liu & Chu, 2023).

While allparticipants made personal effrts to expand their AlI experiences through various social activities. Notably, only one participant, a Progressve Engager, explicitly attributed her Al-related growth to an AI symposium hosted by her university. This finding suggests that self-directed learning and per exchanges, rather than institutional initiatives, were the primary sources of AIrelated social expansion. However, intitutional support is critical for fostering teachers' professional well-being (Zhang & Zhang, 2023).

According to Seligman (2011), positive psychology is built upon three pillars: Positive emotions, positive traits, and positive in. stittions. Istitutional climate strongly predict teacher self-eficacy and psychological well-being (Kraft & Papay, 2014). Moreover, institutions play a key role in providing teacher education and professional training, whichi essential for supportig positive psychological constructs and physical well-being (De Costa et al., 2018; Zhang, Fathi, & Nadari, 2023). The absence of institutional support can lead to emotional labor or burnout (Benesch, 2017; Miller & Gkonou, 2018; Zhang & Zhang, 2023), potentiall undermining teachers' psychological well-being.

In response to the rapid advancements in AI technologies, developing teachers' positive psychology cannot rely solely on self adaptivity, especially given constraints such as aes to technological training and support or an individual's educational background. For example, Productive Engagers with backgrounds in corpus linguistics demonstrated higher adaptability in TAE, while participants lacking technical backgrounds and institutional support faced greater challenges in developing positive emotions and were more susceptible to emotional labor (Zhang & Zhang, 2023).

Given the growing importance of AI in education, there is an urgent need for robust institutional support systems to enhance teachers' digital literacy, particularly in AI-related technical kill in language education. Such a support system could include both internal and external approaches. Internally, institutions could offer targeted training workshops on digital education and organize staff seminars to encourage the exchange of ideas regarding AI advancements. Extenall, inviting scholars and experts to provide updates and training sessons could significantly enhance teachers' innovative thinking. An integrated support system of teachers social network and institutional support would facilitate a successful and effective integration of Al technologies into pedagogical practices, ultimately enhance teachers' digital literacy and students' instrumental competence and learning performance (Zhang, Fathi, & Mohammaddokht, 2023).

# 6. Conclusion

Adopting a dynamic perspective rooted in positive psychology, this longitudinal study explored the role of positive emotions in EFL teachers adaptive experiences, particularly how they leverage these emotions to navigate the challenges posed by Al technologies. Our findings firs confirmed the dynamic interplay between positive and negative emotions, with positive emotions playing a more pivotal role in the development of teachers TAE. Secondly, the study elucidated how translation teachers TAE-such as careersilience and professional development--evolved in tandem with their positive emotions toward AI-assted teaching practices. Notably, EFL teachers' positive emotions underwent distinct phase transitions initial, mid-stage, and later stage-highlighting thir ongoing adaptation and gradual acceptance of AI in their teaching.

Additionally, a non-linear and adaptive dynamic pattern was observed across al three categories of teachers (Potential, Pro gressive, and Productive Al Engagers, regardlessof their initial atitudes toward Al. Finally, our findings demonstrate that the evolution of EFL teachers' positive emotions was closely interconnected with their social networks (including student, colleagues, and affiliated institutions) and individual professional backgrounds, al of which contributedto enhancing their adaptive disposition and cognitive flexibility in TAE These results suggest that EFL teachers positie emotions and TAE will continue to evolve, with ongoing fluctuations, as their teaching practices persist.

This study underscores the significant role of language teachers in the era of AI advancement. While they face challenges, language teachers are encouraged to collaborate efectively with Al technologies. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on a cohort of ten translation EFL teachers and may not be generalizable to al educators. Future research could expand on this work by recruiting diverse populations and employing a variety of instruments and tools.
