# 1. Introduction

The use of digital multimodal composing (DMC) in language classrooms is gaining in popularity. It i defined by Jiang (2017) as "a textual practice that involves the use of digital tools to produce texts by combining multiple semiotic modes that include, but are not limited to, mage, word, and soundtrack" (p.413). The multimodality of DMC allows students to express meanings in a range of modes that goes beyond the use of language,at the same time drawing on the affordances of digital media as part of the creative meaning-making process While considerable work has gone into the design and implementation of DMC in L2 and EFL classrooms (e. g. Haner, 2014, 2015; Jiang, 2017), as well as perceptions of teachers i using DMC in their teaching (Li, 2020), it can be seen that a significant number of DMC studies has a primary purpose for language teaching and learning; further investigation is needed to understand the use of DMC in providing a creative space for students to consolidate and demonstrate understanding of abstract knowledge in content courses, in which the objective of learning moves beyond developing language proficiency, to the development of higher-order thinking. Grapin's (2019) study on students' use of DMC in developing disciplinary practices in Science and Engi. neering is one of the few studies which expand the use of DMC from fulfilling a language learning objective to developing students disciplinary practices, and the author call for a ned to broaden \*what \*counts" as meaning-making in the content area classroom" (p.49). Theoretically, there is also a lacuna in the research literature in terms of bringing together the notions of DMC and translanguaging (Li, 2018), both of which are concerned with transcending existing boundaries of writing and modalities in order to reconceptualise writing as multimodal design (Belcher, 2017).

Engaging in DMC can be sen as an act of translanguaging whereby students draw on a range of resources in their repertoires when making meaning, including spoken and writte language, image, sound effect, also bringing with them their identity and experiences (Li, 2011, 2018). The space created by translanguaging is a translanguaging space which is constructed by participants bringing together different dimensions of their experience and expectations into "one coordinated and meaningful performance" (Li, 2011, p. 1223). Translanguaging space is not a space where different identities, values and practices simply co-exist, but combine together to generate new identities, values and practices" (ibid). Zhu, Li, and Jankowicz-Pytel (2019) further add that translanguaging space is where "all the semiotic systems are integrated and orchestrated' (p.1).

This paper presents a case study of how a group of undergraduate students in Hong Kong engage in DMC to create an instructional video as part of their course asessment. By analysing the focus group interview conducted with the project group after the course, supplemented by multimodal analysi of the instructional video produced, and email exchanges with the teacher-researcher, the study reported in this paper reveals that students not only mobilised and orchestrated the range of semiotic resources at their disposal-some of which are unfamilia to them - they also actively bring their own beliefs and experiences with academic genes, as well as their wn exposure of the outside world' of the popular ouTube genres that they have encountered tothe DMC proces, resultig in the creation of atranslanguaging space which embraces students \*funds of knowledge\* (Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992) and their aility to bring the outside in (Teo, 2008; Tai & Li, 2020). This study positions students as emerging academic writers of English, who are also amateur expert' (Bhatia, 2018) in disciplinary knowledge. Hence, the focus of the case presented in this paper centres around the "tensions between instutional practices and the dynamic, creative experience f textual production (Early, Kendrick, & Potts, 2015, p. 453, my italics), namely etween the constraints of implementing translanguaging practices in a linguistically restricted space, and the benefits of engaging in a translanguaging pace. The study thus cll for the use of a translanguaging perspective to highlight how students transcend and negotiate the diffrent ideological boundaries they encounter at the level of register, genres, and modalities.

# 2. DMC and the reconceptualisation of writing

In recent years, DMC has been increasingly adopted by teachers as a creative way of developing students' L2 writing skils. Its development is based on the premise that new digital communication forms are emerging which combines different modes, such as image, sound, animation, and so on. Hence, the traditional notion of writing, i. writing as a stand-alone skill that only concerns the linguistic mode, needs to be reconceptualised (Belcher, 2017). Writing should be seen as a form of multimodal design so that the linguistic mode is not considered superior' or more resourceful, and that it i simply one possible mode among the many modes that can be drawn upon to make meaning (Hafner, 2018). This re-thinking of writing urges students to take advantage of their 'enlarged semiotic oolkit and engage in new ways of composing which considers the 'new' affordances of new media: multimodality, inter activity and hypertextuality (Jones & Hafner, 2021). In particular, the move from page toscreen also creates new conditions on which writing is realised. The screen is a medium which privileges not only writing, but increasingly relies on image. Kress (2003) observes that \*the pressing use of imageis forcing  reassessment of what writing is, what it does and does not do, and what it can and cannot do .." (p.10, calling for a broader definition of writig. He predicted that writig wil increasingly be shaped by the logic f the screen which gives moresalience to display of images as a result of the ris in the use of new media. From a multimodal perspective, language learning goes beyond the acquisition of linguisticstructures; i is also about drawing on the whole semiotic repertoire and selecting apt mode(s) for meaning-making. In Kress (2000) piece in TEs0L Quarterl, he explained that there are things that language does better than image, and vice versa. To be an effective language user in this digitl world t is not enough to merely produce sentences which are correct in terms f tructural features, but it i also mportant to understand the \*functional spcialization of modes" - the idea that modes are differently resourceful' in a multimodal ensemble (Jewit, Beemer, & OHalloran, 2016). This i an important reminder for TESOL practitioners to embrace the distinct potentials different modes ofer in making meaning by incorporating MC in their teaching. This reconceptualisation of writing as multimodal design, however, is not without criticisms (see Casanave, 2017; Chun, Smith, & Kern, 2016 for a summary of concerns on the perceived detrimental effects of DMC on literacy).

An extensive body of empirical research has been focusing on the design and implementation of DMC in L2 classrooms, and how it implementation enhances students motivation for L2 learning (ee, e.g., Haner, 2015; Hafner & Miller, 2019; Smith, Pacheco, & de Almeida, 2017; Jiang & Luk, 2016). In Hafner and Millr (2019), the authors documented in detail how they incorporated a DMC task of filming a scientific documentary in an English for Science course at a universty in Hong Kong. Through following students composing process, the authors argue that the DMC tak \*provided opportunities to raise student awareness of a much-expanded range of modes' (p.172) by encouraging them to mobilise diferent multimodal strategies and adopt a range of discoursal identities. The outcome of the course i shown to have enhanced students' learner autonomy, collaboration skill, and the unexpected' development of a plurilingual learning environment in which students leveraged their L1 to support a range of project-related tasks. The multilingual and multimodal nature of DMC has also been explored by Smith et al. (2017). In their study, they showed how bilingual students engage in \*multimodal codemeshing" - a proces which allows them to transcend the boundarie of languages and modalities. Furthermore, making use of the notion of daptive transer (DePalma & Ringer, 2011), Kang (2022) explores how Korean students transfer knowledge across writing genres and media. She found that students constantly draw on prior knowledge gained in familiar contexts and apply it in unfamiliar context. She further obseres that this transfer processis complex and dynamic in which students actively reshape the knowledge transferred from one genre or mediato another so that the resulting work demonstrates consideration of purpose and audience.

Not only can DMC be used instrumentally to enhance students' L2 proficiency, it can also be a space for students to explore their own identity, and to challenge existing norms and conventions. Haner (2015) observes that in the context of the English for Science course, students made use of remixing to \*incorporate a broader range of voices in their texts, and such act provides them with more discoursal identities they can position themselve in, such as being reporters and secret agents' in ascientifi documentary (p.504) Similarly, in Darvin's (2020) study on YouTube adaptations of Filipino students iving in Canada, he explored how these students created transnational narratives to document their lived experiences as Filino migrants using translanguaging and transmediation, and arguetht this MC proces i n act of critical resistance aforded by crtivit and criticlit. The stdy shows that the crtivity and criticalit afforded by DMC tass empower student to reposition themselves as not only passively fulflling the requirement of an assesment task, but they are empowered to (reinvent exising conventions through making use of a range of linguistic and semiotic resources.

# 3. Translanguaging space in DMC

The call for reconceptualising writing coincides with the trans- turn in applied linguistics which unsettles the roleof language as a static, monolithic entity. It acknowledges that \*human communication entail the coordination and interpretation of a vast array of semiotic resources that are entangled with language in fluid and unpredictable ways" (Hawkins, 2018, p. 55-56). Translanguaging emphasises the fluidity of multilingual and multimodal resources in language users' repertoire, the transformative capacity of the translanguaging proces which enables knowledge construction and formation of new identities, and the transdisciplinary consequences of blurring the boundaries between disciplines (Li, 2018). Translanguaging "foregrounds the diffrent ways language users employ, create, and interpret different kinds of signs to communicate across contexts and participants and perform their different subjectivities (id, p.14). Translanguaging also has a social justice dimension, in which Otheguy, Garcia, and Reid (2015) defin t as the deployment of a speakersfull inguistic repertoire without regard for watchful adherence to the socially and politically defined boundaries of named (and usually national and state) languages' (p. 283). The rethinking of language and modalities advocated by translanguaging is also relevant to TEsOL practitioners, for example, for improving asessment practices that take into account multilingualism and multimodality (se, e.g. Gorter & Cenoz, 2017; Garcia, Ibarra, & Seltzer, 2017), and to create a safe space that embraces all linguistic codes or modes of expressions for students to be who they are (Garcia & Li, 2014).

A growing number of studies on translanguaging has thus far been focused on making sense of multilingual practices in classroms (see e.g. Creese & Blackledge, 2010; Lin & He, 2017; Poza, 2018) L2 writing (Kim & Chang, 2020), online stes and platorms see, e.g. Melo-Pfeifer and Araujo e Sa, 2018; Li & Ho, 2018; Ho & Li, 2019). There have also been studies on stakeholders' perceptions of translanguaging practices in schools (see, e.g., Woll 2020; Liu & Fang, 2020). Whilea wide range of contexs and stakeholders are covered in these studies, and rich, in-depth descriptions of multilingual practices are produced and accounted for, nevertheless,the multimodal nature of translanguaging, i.e., transcending the boundary of modalities, has yet to be investigated in depth. Only in a handful of studies can we find an in-depth treatment of the multimodal nature of translanguaging (e.g. Ho & Li, 2019; Li & Ho, 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). Hence, this area of inqury warrants more investigation, for translanguaging \*embraces the multimodal social semiotic view that linguistic signs are part of a wider repertoire of modal resources that sign makers have at their disposal and that carry particular socio-historical and political associations" (Li, 2018, p.14). The transcending of modalities is a crucial part of trans. languaging which distinguishes i from code-switching or code-mixing, both of which attend to the structural aspects of the linguistic mode without considering the multimodal dimensions of meaning-making practices.

# 4. Translanguaging, English-medium instruction, and English for academic purposes

In recent years, an increasing number of studies has been focusing on the use of translanguaging in English for academic purposes (EAP) classrooms operating within English-medium instruction (EMI) contexts. This is also in response to the increasingly globalised higher education setting. With an understanding that theE in EMI should be understood as Englishas a lingua franca (ELF), or ELF in academic setigs (Baker, 2021; Kirkpatrick, 2017), it brings to the fore the multilingual dimension which frames students (and teachers) academic practices, and hence the prevalence of translanguaging practices in EAP classroms in recent years. For instance, Liu et al. (2020) implemented a design-based research in which the teacher collaborated with a researcher and used translanguaging pedagogy in an EAP classrom in China, focusing on students attainment of disciplinary information, management of information, and application of critical reading and writing skills. They also investigated the teacher's challenges and concerns in implementing translanguaging pedagogy in an otherwise EMI classroom. In another study, Le and Canagarajah (2019) explores how transculturalism and translingualism are demonstrated in a multilingual student's EAP writing, and argues that the student'stranslingual performance has helped him traverse diferent transcultural communities and constructed \*new meaning-making osibility through challenging the monolingual ideology dominant in EAP (p. 11). In terms of course design, Hillr (2021) introduced translanguaging in an EAP course in China with a focus on introducing Chinese culture to an international audience in the university. The author observes that translanguaging practices llow students to explore topics that are written in other languages, which \*makes possibleconditions that break down structures privileging monolingual ideologies and prestige languages and varieties" (p. 316). Nonetheles, while translanguaging practices are found to be conducive to students' (language) learning, knowledge creation, identity transformation, and intercultural sensitivity, translanguaging practices are oftentimes marginalised, or used with caution by stakeholders due to various institutional constraints and personal beliefs (see, e.g. Rajendram, 2021; Liu et al., 2020).

In view of the use of atranslanguaging framework in this study, one important point that has to be made clear from the outset i that the present study takes place in an EI lassroom designed for English-major students. While it i without dispute that translanguaging is not only about transcending the boundarie between named languages, but also the boundaries between language and other semiotic and modal resources for meaning-making (Li, 2018; Li & Ho, 2018), the multimodal dimension of translanguaging has not always ben examined in its own right As mentioned in the previous sections, existing translanguaging research tended to focus on the multilingual aspects of drawing on the ful lingustic repertoire of language users. The focus of this paper, therefore, is on how students perform translanguaging using the afordances of the physical and digital environment that transcend disciplinary conventions, genres, and modalities. This case study can be seen as translanguaging within a space where ideologically constructed language policy is being stipulated. The study unpacks how students, albeit situated in a linguistically restricted space dominated by a monolingual ideology, exercise creative agency in breaking the artificial boundaries of register, genre, and modal resources to present their knowledge.

Taken together, both translanguaging and DMC practices provide spaces for language users to express their creativity and criticality through drawing on the multilingual and multimodal resources in their repertoires. It can further be said that DMC contains a translanguaging potential which provides the materiality for translanguaging to occur (see Lee & Li, 2020). Nevertheles, there is a paucity of research on bringing translanguaging and DMC together and exploring their complementarity in pedagogical practices. One notable exception is the study conducted by Smith et al.(2017) which explores students' multimodal codemeshing process by following their compositional paths consting of the synergistic use of semiotic resources such as visual and sounds, and also students use of heritage languages to support their rhetorical goals and express their multilingual identities.

Given the paucity of research into the relationship between translanguaging and DMC in content-specific subjects that require students to demonstrate (and visualise) knowledge of astract concepts, this study seeks to adress the following rearch question: How is a translanguaging space constructed through students' engagement in DMC?

# 5. The study

This paper focuses on an undergraduate course for English-major students at a university in Hong Kong with an aim to develop students DMC skills. This objective is achieved through providing students with a solid foundation of the theoretical concept of multimodality (Kres, 2010) and multimodal design principles (Kres & van Leeuwen, 2021), which subsequently lead to the creation of a variety of new media writing genres. In the academic year that this study was conducted, thecourse was an elective course with an enrolment of 38 students. Most students are L2 writers of English with Cantonese as their L1.

Students enrolled in the course meet once a week, each class meeting lasts for 3 hours during the 13-week semester. The course includes thre assessment tass: 1) new media writing portfolio individual tas consisting of the creation of a wesit, a digital story, and a podcast), 2) instructional video (group work), and 3) analytical esay (individual work). The focus of this paper is the second task, the collaborative instructional video, which is a form of DMC. As explained by Martin and Betrus (2019), instructional videos come in a variety of forms, incuding various combinations of live vide capture interviews, recorded video conference, or cripted videos' (p.67). Students were scaffolded based on a genre-based approach whereby students were exposed to some popular instruc. tional videos found on YouTube, ranging from how to ssemble an IKA bookcase, t language teaching videos. In clas, they discussed the language features and multimodal trategie used in these videos contributing to their (inefectiveness in conveying knowledge to a lay audience. Nevertheles, throughout the preparation of the project, whil students were ncouraged to fllow the tges of DMC as outlined in Hafner and Miller (2019), i.e. 1) reading/data collection; 2)scripting/stryboarding; 3) performing/recording; 4) editing; and 5) sharing, i should also be noted that students were given the freedom to recursively [shuttle back and forth between visually conceptualizing ideas they wanted to videotape and evaluating how they would go about creating those ideas" (Smith, 2017, p.263, see also Bruce, 2009).

Students were given a broad assgnment prompt to create a 6-minute instructional vide to explain to a lay audience why, and how, writing on the screen differs from writig on paper. I position thestudents as amateur experts' (hatia, 2018)- 'amateur' in a sense that they have just mastered the concept of multimodality and multimodal composing, also as emerging academic writers in English, and experts because they are required to explain abstract concepts in an accessible way to a lay audience. This positioning plays a part in the kind of discoursal identities they choose to align themseles with In addition, while the genre of this assgnment is an instructional video, students are expected to demonstrate academic knowledge. Hence, it can be said that this DMC task takes on the characteristics of two genres: academic writing and instructional video.

In the semester in which the data was ollected, all fae-to-face classes were suspended due to CoviD-19, and therefore students were encouraged to carry out this collaborative task without meeting each other physically. This results in an increased use of online resources rather than real-life fotage (as was originall intended). Before the submission of the project, there was a sharing sesion whereby each group would share the draft of their video to the class for comments to improve on their final work.

The present study adopts a qualitative approach to data collction and analysis A qualitative case study approach allows the teacher-reearcher to obtain an in-depth understanding of how different project groups adopt different ways to construct a translanguaging space using DMC. The teacher-reearcher ivited allthe 38 students to participate in the study, and eight students from two different project groups agreed to take part in it voluntarily. Upon their agreement, consent was sought from each student, and the students were given an introduction of the objectives of the project, and were informed of their right to remain anonymous and to withdraw from the study without having to give any reasons, and without adverse consequences. Students were also informed that participation in the study or not) would not affect their grade for the course. Every care was taken to ensure that student participants took part in thestudy without any pressure to do so, thus ligning with the university's ethical guideline. The current study focuses on a single case study of one project group with four students (hereafter called Group 1) because of the richness of the data collected from the multiple source of data produced by the group. The four students areal ilingual English major students with Cantonese as their L1. All of them are emerging academic writers in English. Table 1 shows the background information of the four students:

The study is informed by three data sources: 1) focus group interview with students, 2) instructional video created by the student group, and 3) email exchanges between the teacher-researcher and the students. The focus group interview is the primary data source informing this study, whereas the other two data sources supplement the interview data. The instructional video is analysed multi. modall by identifying the semioticresources employed in each section. The interview was conducted on Zoom after the course had finished. Discourse-based semi-structured interviews were used so that participants have the chance to review the instructional videos they produced, and refer t it in the interview (Harwood, 2009; Odell Goswami,  Harrington, 1983). Discourse-based interviews are particularly useful i this study to elicit participants perspectives, and to encourage discussions on the reasons for their choices, and what they intended to achieve through these choices (Hyland, 2007). The interview concluded with a general question on the dif. ferences between DMC and traditional forms of ssessments suchas esays and presentations. The interview lasted for 60 minutes and was conducted in English. It was video-recorded and later transcribed verbatim. Fig. 1 shows the interview procedures.

Interview data was analysed based on a thematic analysis procedure (Braun & Clarke, 2006), following an inductive approach (Strauss& Corbin, 1994). Ifirst immersed myself in the interview transcripts through repeated reading and noting down initialobservations in order to familiaise myself with the data. Afterward, atentative coding scheme emerged, and codes were thus collated into themes. The themes were then defined, reviewed, and cross-checked with other data sources to ensure that the interpretation is trustworthy using the process of constant comparison (Richards, 2003). Further exploration of possible connections between themes was also conducted throughout the data analysis process.

# 6. Findings

In what follows, selected themes relating to students' orchestration of linguistic and semiotic resources to construct a translanguaging space as amateur experts are presented, supported by representative quotes extracted from each theme.

6.1. Transcending and negotiating registers, genre conventions and modalities

As the data revealed, students showed understanding of the affordances and constraints of each mode available to them. In the instructional video, not only did they recognise the need to demonstrate understanding of key words relating to the course, they also considered the need to make the content accessible toa lay audience by orchestrating multiple modes in order to create a concurrent or complementary relation between text and image to illustrate abstract concepts (Unsworth, 2007).

Extract 1

I sometimes highlighted some relly omplicated sentences from the cript] tht I want to discuss with tudent P, I said, those sentences are really complicated that we have to think of some visual elements to supplement them (Group 1, Student M, Interview excerpt)

As seen in this excerpt, students in Group 1 followed the recommended procedure of writing a cript before filming. As they wrote the script, they know that they haveto demonstrate understanding of abstract concepts through using an academic reister -the type of register that they know they have to demonstrate understanding of as an undergraduate student working on a course assgnment. Nevertheles, when faced with the conflicting demands that 1) the assgnment i a video, not an essay, and 2) the video has to be accesibl to a lay audience as well as asessed by a university lecturer, students areaware that reading aloud a complicated sentence full of acadmic jargon would not be the best way to fulfil the objective of this tas, and hence they haveto draw on some other modes, registers and genre conventions to help them ill the gap of the limitation of the academic register expressed in linguistic mode. For instance, in the video that Group 1 create, they rely on image (rel if fotage and cartoon) to ilustrate the concept of linearity and modularity:

In Fig. 2, linearity of writing on paper is emphasised by someone laboriously writing a story on a piece of paper constrained by the limits of the page and not being able to edit. This fotage shows the temporal and sequential nature of writing and demonstrates a clear reading path designed by the writer. On the other hand, modularity of writing on the screen is emphasised by cartoon image, with imaginary multimodal elements on the screen depicted by circles with no clear reading path, thereby inviting readers to be co. designers. This example also illstrate asophisticated orchestration of modes which shows concurrent, and at times complemen. tary relation between the text and on-screen text (Unsworth, 2007). For example, when the narrator, Student S, mentions keywords such as speech', temporal, sequential, the writte form of these words simultaneously apears as on-screen text. Another example is when students explain the concept of reading path' of writing on paper as prescribed, the appearance of astone path on the screen supports the spoken narration of a linear' and sequential reading path which is designed by the author'. This combination of visual and animation provides extra meaning to the spoken narration. As observed by Hafner and Ho (2020), modal interaction is what teachers paid attention to when asessing DMC, and the authors found that teachers viewed \*concurrence and complementarit as a reflection of students' abilit to synthesie complex information and to make scientific research accessible to the intended audience" (p.8).

This example also shows how students transcend and negotiate the artifial boundaries of registers, genre conventions and mo. dalities. As Li (2018) points out, translanguaging highlights the ways in which language users make use of the tensions and conflicts among different signs, because of the ocio-historicalassocitions the signs carry with thm, in a cycle of resemiotization (p.14) It is clear in the above example that students are aware of the socio-historical practice of academic register, thereby realising the tensions which exist between the use of an academic register, as required by most assignments at the universt, and the need to make the content accessible to a lay audience through a video, which ofentimes requires a non-academic register fre of jargon. Rather than seeing the two as binary opposites, the students are able to transcend the boundarie between academic and non-academic registers, and creatively draw on a more casual, spoken register to engage the audience (e.g., addressing the audience as you, itroducing a keyword deliberately as in here comes a tem named reading path), and incorporate keywords in the course readings that are expected in this assignment, such as temporal, sequentil, reading path, and co-desigers. It can be argued that students transcend the use of a particular register and modality by not adhering to the confines of the expected socio-historical boundaries; they creatively and critically create  rgister that i fit for the purpose of this particular asiment. In smilar vein, the students also transcend existing understanding of genre conventions, both of the academic genre, and the instructional video genre, and create their own understanding of how an academic instructional video should be like. This is primarily acheved by multimodal orchestration which carefully synchronises the appearance (both in terms of the aesthetic form and the timed apearance) of the on-screen texts, spoken narration, and their orresponding visuals. The students can therefore be seen as inventing a new genre convention for this task, for the resulting video shows consistency in showcasing features of this newly created 'genre'. The multimodal orchestration of the previously mentioned modes also demonstrates students attempt to use visuals and narration in a way that can exemplify the meaning of the keywords, thus forming acomplementary relationship between modes whereby the meaning of the keywords is carred' by the visuals (Unsworth, 2007). This can be seen as a kind of \*adaptive transfer cross genre and media" (Kang, 2022) in which students apply prior knowledge gained from familiar contexts (i.e. academic writing/speaking) to unfamiliar contexts (i.e. instructional video which explains academic concepts). DMC thus provides a translanguaging space for the students to recreate, refashion, and recontexualise the linguistic and cultural capital that they have, and \*challenge] conventions and ideological practices that have been constructed by powerful others" (Darvin, 2020, p.583; Maybin & Swann, 2007).

6.2. Creative alignment with academic writing conventions and the wider academic discourse community

While students are aware that theassignment is in the form of an instructional video made for lay audience, they stil have to find ways to align with academic conventions to demonstrate understanding of course content, as stated in the course intended learning outcomes. As shown in the interview, and also in other empirical studies (e.g. Hafner & Ho, 2020), multimodal orchestration seems to be an important component of DMC. For students participating in this study, they saw multimodal orchestration as an umbrell term which encompasses the idea of coherence, an important feature of academic writing:

Excerpt 2

I think the multimodal orchestration is reall important because if they fail to work together with different modes, then the whole vide was bound  all part . We also paid a lot f atention t thescrit, we dd a lot f tanstional wors: therefore, first f all, in tun' to hel people to understand what th video is tying to convey in  more ffective manner (Group 1, Student , intrview excerpt)

By adding transitional words, not only has the video achieved \*semiotic harmony" (Kress 2010) on a linguistic level, there is also multimodal orchestration. In the interview, students specificlly drew the teacher-researcher's attention to the following example (Extract 3 and Fig.3) in which they triedto incorporate elements of what they perceived as good practices' in academic presentations and multimodal orchestration in the instructional video.

Although not explicitly required in the instructional video, the students demed i necessary to inroduce the voice that audience would hear in the video, not diferent from introducing the presenters in an academic presentation. For undergraduate students majoring in English in Hong Kong, academic presentation is almost standard practice that is ingrained in the years of practice and experiences they have had. What isinteesting i not why they did it, but how they did it in the context fa video which they recorded separately, and simultaneously striving to preserve a form of visual coherence. The decision of how to create this part had been a subject of discussion during the video-making process among the students, and in the interview with the teacher-researcher:

Extract 3

Originadll I've wanted to use our own face, ecause I think it's  way for us to addressto the audience, ike to be more engaged with the audience, but then Student M also mentioned the point that it wouldn'tbe very synchronised with th rest of the video, so then we decided to use this emoji icon so it could also act as a means to engage with the audience (Group 1, Student P, interview excerpt)

In the above screen-captures (Fig. 3), students adopt creative ways to introduce themselves as presenters, as in an academic presentation. While students had ben instructed in different multimodal strategies to engage the audience, such as the use of gaze realised by addressing the audience directly through looking at the camera, they were constrained by the social distancing measures and were encouraged not to conduct any filming as a group. As a result, most f the content of the video was created either by students filming individuall, or using animations that could be found online. Working under these constraints, in order to preserve visual coherence, the students found another way to engage the audience and achieve semiotic harmony by using memoji which resembles their 'real-life face. Memojis are customizable cartoon human heads" (Herring et al., 2020), or an "avatar that tracks your facial movements" (Tillman, 2021). The students all agreethat this is done to give the audience a sense of visual presence which simultaneously displays creativity whil following academic conventions. Student P and Student M both point out that ths i also astrategic decision about using moddlity to express truth value, which is the "reliability of images as representation of reality" (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2021; Ravell & van Leeuwen, 2018, p. 280). As most of the video iscreated using cartoon images (with low truth value), the students have the desire to represent themselves using memoji instead of a photo, the former having a lower truth value than the latter, to preserve visual coherence (see Kress & van Leeuwen, 2021 for a discussion of modality').

Another example i how students cite key texts and quotes in the course in the instructional video (Figs. 4 and 5). Similar to writing an academic esay, students were constantly reminded of the importance of proper ctation Extract 4 shows students' awarenes of one of the major elements of the construction of an academic dentity, which i cedibility (Hyland, 2011). While students already had alot of exposure to referencing in the context f academic essays and presentations, they had lttle experience in academic referencing n an instructional video. The difficulty students encountered was that while the instructional video genre in itslf is semi-formal, the fact that this is an academic ssignment required some form of formality and it has to adhere to the academic citation conventions, and at times the academic register. Students also acknowledged that this is to enhance credibility of the video:

Extract 4

Because this i an instructional video, credilit is quite important, so we had to cite some words from famous people or scholars so as to make the whole instructional video more credible and professional (Group 1, Student M, interview excerpt)

Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate the range of resources that students use to position themselves as amateur experts, and traverse different discoursal identities. In Fig. 4, an image of Kress is shown on the right-hand side of the page to give salience to the person who expressed a viewpoint, whereas in Fig.5 the students created a cartoon teacher, presumably to depict thir fictional role as a teacher while giving salience to the diagram.

As the students conclude the video, insted of showing a reference list as in academic essays or presentations, they decided to align themselves with the genre convention of YouTube instructional videos, i.e. to invite the audience to \*check out the description box" (Fig. 6), to like" and \*share" the video (Fig. 7). This example ilustrates how students generate new discoursal identitie for themselves, as undergraduat students who comply with the academic convention, and as amateur experts who make use f the affordances of video to take on an expert position, albeit with some sense of uncertainty. This conflict of multiple identities is rflected in the students distancing themselves from areal expert position b utilizing a cartoon imag with low modality to deict themselve Kress and van Leeuwen, 2021).

The above examples show how students creatively and critically reinvent conventions based on their experiences of academic presentations by incorporating popular meaning-making resources such as memoji. Students also drew on multiple modes for making in-text citations' by visually showing the image of the author whose words they cited (Fig. 4), and visualising the diagram as they describe it (Fig. 5). By showing themseles as memoj, or an avatar, the students simultaneously inject humour to the otherwiseserious instructional video, challenging the historicised beliefs that academic work should be serious and formal. The whole video traversed different registers, timescales and lifeworlds which bridge students everyday lives and knowledge outside and inside the classroom acquired at diffrent points in their lives, and hence a translanguaging space is created through the complex orchestration and resemiotization of multiple discourses, modes, and media.

# 6.2.4. Students' perceptions

When asked about the similarites and differences between DMC and traditional forms of assignments such as essays and presentations, both Student M and P expressed that DMC provides them with an'enlarged' repertoire to demonstrate understanding of lesson content:

Extract 5

When it comes to writing an essay, the writer can only present his ideas through written text. This may be related to the affordances of written text and video. In some cases, video may sometimes be bettr to ilustat deas and omplicated points because of the supplement of visual and audio elements (Group 1, Student P, email exchange)

A similar view is echoed by Student M:

Fig. 7. Screen-captures of the instructional video.

Videos have image modes and are able to make meaning-making a lot easier. For example, when describing what aples are to people, it seems bter to simply show people an image of apples and say "this s apple", instead of solely verball saying "apple are round fruits with shiny red or green skin and firm white flesh" (Group 1, Student M, email exchange)

All four students agree that leaning about DMC and the theoretical underpinnings behind it gives them a oice to demonstrate their understanding of lesson content, which is not available in other forms f asessment. This could be due to the building of a trans. languaging space which allows them to draw on an enlarged set of semiotic resources. A course dedicated to developing students theoretical and hands-on ability to create multimodal texts urges this group of English major students to reconceptualise language in relation to other semiotic modes. As Student M commented, afer the experience of engaging in DMC tasks, he started to realise the constraints of language, and the importance of multimodal orchestration:

Extract 7

I came to realise ..] we don't rely on words to convey meaning. We no longer rely on words a lot to convey meaning. Most of the time words have to combine with other modes, and in this regard we have to learn how different modes can work together to convey meanings more effectively (Group 1, Student M, interview excerpt)

While many students would regard DMC as a form of artistic or aesthetic practice which they do in out-of-clas contexts for leisure. this course provided them with an opportunity to directly apply theory into practice:

Extract 8

I did podcasts, I did videos before, but never would I thought of how to make itbettr, how to make meanings, how to convey meanings. like to orchestrate in a better way. But then this course is kind f like helping us to realise modes can actually orchestrate, like these are actually elements that would help audience to understand your message bettr. (Group 1, Student P, interview excerpt)

In this project group, most of the production work is done by Student P who has prior experience in making videos in secondary school. This experience has further positioned him as an 'expert in this particular project as someone who posesses the technical skills evertheles, the successful creation of DMC goes beyond posessing technical sills. As can be seen from the excerpts above, students recognise the need to go beyond the confines of using a single mode, i. the linguistic mode, to become successul communicators in the future.

# 7. Discussion

To recap, this study addresses the folowing research question: How is a translanguaging space constructed through students engagement in DMc? Three themes relating to students' orchestration of linguistic and semiotic resources to construct a translanguaging space as amateur experts have been presented, all of which point to how students transcended sociohistorical and ideological boundaries of academic and disciplinary registers, enre conventions, and modalities. What emerged from the analysis is that students' beliefs and experiences of doing academic essays and academic presentations, together with their out-of-class exposure to YouTube intructional video genres enabled the creation of a translanguaging space which allows students to combine their funds of knowledge' to generate new identities and practices as emerging academic writers who can write across plaforms and modalities (Li, 2011). The DMC processals allows them to \*bring the outside in, transcending conventional norms and boundaries (Teo, 208; Tai & Li, 2020).

The DMC task of creating an instructional video reported in the current study allows students to make full use of their repertoires, albeit still under constraints of the monolingual language policy implemented in the classoom. Through participating in this transIanguaging space, students have also been able to cross the boundary between the different goals of multimodal writing - what Lim and Polio (2020) categorised as disciplinary' and creative expressions, with the former focusing on meeting disciplinary/academic genre conventions, and the later providing experiences for students to use multiple modes for creative production. In the instructional video assigment, students recontextualised what they understood to beacademic and non-academic genres, and creatively adopted features of both in their asignment, simultaneously demonstrating understanding of abstract concepts through the use of multiple modes. In this sense, the DMC task enables students to generate multiple, new identities, such as the identity as novice academic writers, and amatur experts. At tims thedentt potions are taken p with diffeent les f etin whichi incad y static choice of semiotic resources. This echoes Luzon's (2018) observation of academic blogs that \*digital genres offer possibilities for the con. struction of group identity not afforded by traditional academic genres" (p.37). The students fatured in the study would not have een able to claim the identity of amateur experts had the assignment been a traditional' five-paragraph essay.

This study calls for acloser integration between the notions of DMC and translanguaging. Whil existing studies on translanguaging pedagogies tended to focus on embracing students' multilingual repertoires in the classoom, more emphasis can be placed on encouraging students to also make use of their 'enlarged' multimodal repertoire for disciplinary and creative expressions. One way to realise this is by engaging students in DMC tass. The key is to help raise students' awareness of the dferent affordances and constraints of modes, and be ableto choose apt mode(s) to convey meaning for a variety of communicative contexts. DMC can thus beseen as an avenue for students to perform translanguaging, and to encourage them to make use of their dynamic and creative resources across and beyond the borders of named registers, genre conventions, and modalities.

This study aims to offer a new vantage point for researchers to \*position translanguaging in writing as an author's purposeful leveraging of semiotic resources from [an] integrated language system" (Smith et al., 2017, p. 7). Such a position complements the social semiotic approach to multimodalit by offering insights into how students move across academic and disciplinary registers, genre conventions and modalities. As Lee and Li (2020) commented, translanguaging is performative, and this includes everyday performance in mundane situations; it exudes creativity and criticlity, generating postive dsturbance to social interaction' (p.395; original emphasis. While existing approaches to investigating DMC have addressed important features seen in DMC, such as hybridity, intertextualit, and interdiscursvity (se, e.g., Hafner & Miler, 2019), the added value f translanguaging to the study of DMC is to highlight the criticality exhibited by students, especially on how they challenge and break boundaries that are ideologically constructed. This fous on criticalit positions students as active agents, and in crtain EL contexts, t can be used as a means to empower students and to build an equitable education environment that embraces the multilingual and multimodal repertoires of students from a diverse background (Garcia & Flores, 2014).

# 8. Conclusion and implications

The present study adds to the growing body of empirical research on bridging the connection between DMC and translanguaging, as well as focusing on the use of DMC on content subjects with their respective disciplinary norms and conventios. The findings reported here reveal the empowering and transformative nature of DMC which allow students to go beyond the socio-historical boundaries of registers, genres, and modalities.

Theoretically, this study call for a closer integration between DMC and translanguaging. On the one hand, DMC offers a practical means of realising translanguaging pedagogies that not only prioritises the development of students' multilingual repertoire, but also expand to helping students orchestrate their enlarged' multimodal repertoire brought about by the afordances of digital technologies.

On the other hand, translanguaging offers a critical lens to empower students and transform them in the process by discovering new knowledge and identities.

The findings of the study can also have practical implications for language teachers. DMC tass should be designed in a way that supports flexible inguisic and modal practice, and students are thus encouraged to challenge sociohistorically constructed boundaries to perform thir identity as amateur experts and as emerging academic writers. In addition to selecting apt modes to convey meaning, students aso have to orchestrate language, modes and media in their repertoire. The performative nature f DMC can further increase students investment i language learning Jiang, 2018), and in the case of this study, as emergent and versatile academic and disciplinary writers on digital platforms.

Future research could explore how teachers can strike a balance between scaffolding the task on the one hand, and giving students compositional freedom' on the other (Smith, 2017; 2019). Another research possibility would be to map out the kind of support teachers need to successfull implement DMC i L2 classrooms, focusing on assisting them to cope with new composition tructures, thinking with image, and using technology" (Li, 2020, p. 3). Future work can also explore how DMC tasks can be designed to create multiple translanguaging spaces for students to showcase their funds of knowledge through the use of their heritage language (e.g, Smith et al., 2017), and to demonstrate their understanding of popular genres such as making vlogs or even the now popular TikTok videos and adapt them to an educational purpose. It would also be worthwhile to conduct longitudinal studies t follow the trajectories of how teachers and students develop strategies to navigate the new forms of assesments in the form of DMC, possbly by making use of narrative inquiry.
