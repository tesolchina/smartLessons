The USA is paying increased attention to children’s biliteracy as 49 of 50 states have implemented a Seal of Biliteracy (‘The seal of biliteracy’ 2022) to recognize high school graduates who are proficient in reading and writing at least two languages (Hornberger 1990). Further, numbers of dual-language programs in the USA which promote biliteracy are growing (American Councils Research Center 2021). Increased attention to biliteracy and the global norm of multilingualism (Cenoz and Gorter 2011; Douglas Fir Group 2016) make understanding children’s biliteracy development critical.

Historically, models of bilingual reading have correlated skills and subcomponents of reading across languages (e.g. Grabe 2009; Verhoeven 2011; Koda 2012; Jared 2015). These models tended to be linear and conceptualized learners’ linguistic knowledge as separate, whereas translanguaging theory describes how learners flexibly draw upon one communicative repertoire containing verbal and visual codes that encompass a variety of languages/sign systems (García and Li 2014; Li 2018). In other words, when people engage in translanguaging they dynamically leverage everything they know about languages, sign systems, and so on to communicate and make meaning.

Because translanguaging research has historically focussed on expressive language skills (Canagarajah 2018; Baynham and Lee 2019), more research is needed about how bilinguals engage in translanguaging while reading (García and Kleifgen 2020). Within this, it is important to understand how bilinguals read multilingual texts, especially given the increasingly multilingual landscape in which bilinguals live and interact (Gorter and Cenoz 2015). Therefore, this study’s goal was to describe Spanish-English bilingual children’s reading strategies, that is, the ways in which they engaged in translanguaging while reading dual-language picturebooks for which the entire text was written in Spanish and English.

# Translanguaging and reading

Studies of bilinguals reading have largely been quantitative, illustrating how literacy subskills in one language relate to and may transfer to a subsequent language (e.g. Verhoeven 2011;

Koda 2012; Jared 2015). Such studies of Spanish-English primary-age bilinguals (the population of this study) have found that these children use their knowledge of sounds, words, and spelling to make meaning of Spanish and English (e.g. Durgunoğlu et al. 1993; Nakamoto et al. 2008; Proctor et al. 2010), although the extent to which children apply such knowledge differs by age and language proficiency (e.g. Hancin-Bhatt and Nagy 1994; Bialystok 2006). However, little is written about how children use this linguistic and literacy knowledge, other than the fact that there are statistically significant relationships between discrete literacy skills in each language (such as between English and Spanish alphabetic knowledge, vocabulary knowledge, word identification, listening comprehension, or reading comprehension, e.g. Nakamoto et al. 2008; Proctor et al. 2010). Jared (2015: 165) summarized, ‘in the literature on child bilinguals, the focus has been on predictors of reading development in the second language. Only a few studies have investigated how bilingual children represent and process their two languages—a gap the current study addressed.

# Bilinguals reading monolingual texts

Verbal protocol studies have established that bilinguals engage in translanguaging while reading, but they did not analyse how exactly bilinguals drew upon their communicative repertoires, that is, engaged in translanguaging, which is the focus of the current study. Prior research indicated that bilinguals used the same comprehension strategies when reading monolingual texts in either language—strategies such as predicting, summarizing, inferring, visualizing, and asking/answering questions (e.g. Jiménez et al. 1996; Hardin 2001; Kwon and Schallert 2016; García and Godina 2017; López-Velásquez and García 2017). Although monolingual readers also used these comprehension strategies (Pressley and Afflerbach 1995), bilinguals applied them regardless of text language. Because of that cross-linguistic flexibility, authors asserted that bilingual readers engaged in translanguaging. Further, readers flexibly used languages in their verbal protocol responses, such as describing their strategies in Spanish even though they read English—all of which provided further evidence of translanguaging (Kwon and Schallert 2016; García and Godina 2017; López-Velásquez and García 2017). Findings also indicated that some readers used strategies (i.e. ways of reading and making meaning) unique to bilingual readers, namely mentally translating while reading and looking for cognates in the text (Jiménez et al. 1996; Hardin 2001; García and Godina 2017). However, again, studies reported the existence of these processes but not how bilinguals drew upon their communicative repertoires to engage in them.

# Reading dual-language books

Understanding how people read dual-language books (DLBs) (rather than solely monolingual texts) is important given the multilingual landscape. Furthermore, scholars recommend inclusion of DLBs in classroom libraries (e.g. Freeman et al. 2011) because their two-language format can provide opportunities to compare languages and can support children’s linguistic and cultural identities and awareness (e.g. Ma 2008; Sneddon 2009; Naqvi et al. 2010; Semingson et al. 2015; Zaidi 2020). Although DLBs physically separate languages, translanguaging is applicable because as Ofelia García (2020: 558) stated, ‘translanguaging moves beyond the language of the text itself to focus on the language of the person; that is, on the actions of bilinguals as they engage with the text’. Since the current study focussed on readers’ actions, translanguaging was an appropriate frame. In addition, DLBs’ close positioning of languages could make such internal translanguaging processes more visible.

The limited research of bilinguals reading DLBs has largely focussed on the resulting positive language, literacy, and identity outcomes but not on how bilinguals engage in translanguaging while reading them. Although Thibeault and Matheson (2020) studied how 16 French-English bilingual third and fourth graders in Canada independently read DLBs, their findings seemed to reinforce those of studies of bilinguals reading monolingual texts. They found evidence of children translanguaging, but did not explore how they engaged in that translanguaging. Thibeault and Matheson noted that children used cognates, referred to what they said was an ‘equivalent passage’ (a word or phrase in the text with the same meaning) to support their text comprehension, and recognized that both languages conveyed the same overall ideas. However, the ways children identified ‘equivalent passages’ were not explored.

Overall, studies have shown that translanguaging occurs during reading, but other than mentally translating while reading and using cognates, it is not quite clear how readers engage in translanguaging or what it looks like during reading. The current study attempted to leverage the supportive context DLBs can offer to describe readers’ translanguaging strategies.

# Using translation and retelling tasks to probe translanguaging practices

Given the need to understand how readers engage in translanguaging or what it looks like during reading, the current study asked children to translate individual words and retell specific pages of text and then show and/or describe how they engaged in translation and retelling. Rather than replicate previous research with open-ended questions for readers to describe their thoughts while reading, translating and retelling create contexts for bilinguals to flexibly draw upon their communicative repertoires so that researchers can understand readers’ linguistic knowledge and translanguaging practices. The following paragraphs explain how translation and retelling relate to and create contexts for translanguaging.

García and Li (2014) listed translation as a translanguaging practice because, like other scholars (e.g. Malakoff and Hakuta 1991; Orellana et al. 2003; Escamilla et al. 2014; Jiménez et al. 2015), they see translation as a dynamic process of selecting and employing linguistic knowledge (e.g. semantic, pragmatic, and syntactic) across languages to communicate. In this view, bilinguals flexibly employ their linguistic and semiotic repertoires (i.e. everything they know about languages and sign systems) to make sense of a multilingual world; therefore, they engage in translanguaging (García and Li 2014).

Drawing upon their backgrounds in sociolinguistics and translation studies, Baynham and Lee (2019) reinforced this viewpoint. Through analysis of adults’ multilingual discourse in interpersonal interactions, art, digital poetry, and graphics, they observed how translation happened during translanguaging and how translanguaging occurred within translation. For example, when people engaged in translanguaging, they often had to translate ideas. Furthermore, when they translated, people did not solely move linearly or unidirectionally from one language to another (i.e. code-switch), but instead, they drew upon their full linguistic repertoires to continually and flexibly negotiate meaning—in line with the dynamic nature of translanguaging. Baynham and Lee (2019: 34) asserted ‘that translanguaging can be a way of understanding the moment-to-moment deployment of the multilingual repertoire in the activity of translating’—that is, translanguaging can situate the flexible, complex processes readers engage in when translating.

However, there are important differences between translation and translanguaging. Baynham and Lee (2019: 40) see translation as having an endpoint, whereas ‘a translanguaging perspective magnifies the processual dynamic of translation’. In addition, translation does not ‘destabiliz[e] language borders’ (Baynham and Lee 2019: 40) or disrupt unequal power balances between languages/language practices as translanguaging does (García et al. 2020). Nonetheless, when focussing on bilinguals’ dynamic, nuanced strategies to navigate languages, translanguaging can describe the broader processes that occur in moments of translation. Therefore, asking readers to explain their translation processes using DLBs is one way to understand some of the larger translanguaging processes bilinguals engage in when reading.

Because Ofelia García (2009: 45) defined translanguaging as ‘multiple discursive practices in which bilinguals engage in order to make sense of their bilingual worlds [emphasis original]’, solely asking readers to translate worlds does not fully explore how they make meaning while reading. Therefore, the current study also asked children to retell DLB pages they had read in Spanish and English. Retelling requires the reader to orally describe what they read and integrate the text’s information and their own knowledge (Dougherty Stahl and García 2017). When reading a dual-language picturebook, readers would need to integrate text information written in English and Spanish and depicted in illustrations, along with information encoded in English, Spanish, visually, aurally, and so on in their minds in order to make meaning and describe what happened in the story. This is a flexible, dynamic process utilizing readers’ entire communicative repertoires, thereby reflecting translanguaging. For these reasons, asking children to retell and describe their strategies for retelling helps further illustrate how they engage in translanguaging while reading.

In the end, DLBs create contexts to make translanguaging more visible, and translation and retelling while reading provide opportunities to probe how readers engage in translanguaging—a topic that would benefit from more research. Therefore, the current study sought to answer, ‘How do biliterate children engage in translanguaging while reading DLBs?’

# Methods

This article is based on a mixed methods study in which 63 Spanish-English bilingual third and fifth graders read aloud DLBs and described their translation and retelling strategies (Domke 2019, 2022). Prior publications (Domke 2022) have highlighted the statistically significant differences between the translation strategies of third and fifth graders, children from English monolingual and Spanish bilingual homes, and children with high and low oral reading accuracy scores. This article emphasizes the data from children’s verbal protocols (rather than the resulting statistical analyses) to describe translanguaging during reading and the prevalence of children’s strategies. To determine children’s translanguaging strategies, first I asked children to translate a word or retell the page and then describe their strategies. Next, I analysed children’s words and actions using discourse analysis (Gee 2014), and finally, I totalled strategy frequencies.

# Participants and context

Thirty-one third graders—22 from homes that spoke only English and 9 from homes that spoke at least some Spanish—and 32 fifth graders—22 from English-speaking homes and 10 from homes that spoke some Spanish—read DLBs. (No homes were monolingual Spanish-speaking.) Children attended their school’s dual-language program in either a suburban or urban district in a US Midwestern state. Both programs largely served children from English-speaking homes, although the urban school enrolled a larger percentage of children from homes speaking at least some Spanish. Because each school only had one dual-language section per grade level, all children from the third- and fifth-grade dual-language classes who consented and assented participated in the study. (Two fifth graders did not attend their school’s dual-language program, but had received prior Spanish literacy instruction.)

I included children from homes speaking only English and homes speaking at least some Spanish to capture a range of translanguaging strategies. I did not find strategies to be unique to a particular group (Domke 2019, 2022); therefore, I describe all strategies in the Findings section with quotations from children. After their pseudonyms (many self-selected), I include children’s grade and home language written as 3-ES for third-grade English-speaking home or 5-SS for fifthgrade Spanish-speaking home. No children spoke languages other than English and Spanish.

# Data collection

Text modification. First, I reduced the overall word counts and numbers of syllables in words for two fictional DLBs that children read aloud: Francisco’s Kites/Las cometas de Francisco (Klepeis 2015) and Rainbow Weaver/Tejedora del arcoíris (Marshall 2016). When reducing syllables, I tried to maintain overall meaning by using simpler synonyms when possible. I reduced word counts to approximately 300 words per language for third grade and 500 per language for fifth to maintain readability levels in both languages at or below third and fifth grade, as measured by the FleschKincaid formula for English and its Spanish equivalent, the Fernández Huerta (1959).

Modified texts mirrored the commercially printed originals with the same illustrations and layout. (See Figures 1–4 for examples. Figures describe illustrations rather than reprint them due to copyright.) I also modified the texts by creating one version of each title with English first on each page and another with Spanish first on each page. Children were in counterbalanced groups so that approximately half read a particular title first, and half of those children read the version with English first on each page.

Initial interview. Next, I interviewed children to build rapport and learn about their home languages and language practices. Due to issues of validity with home language surveys (Abedi 2008), I determined children’s home languages through their responses to interview questions such as, ‘What languages do you speak at home? With whom? What language do you speak most at home?’ I also asked children when they learned to read in both Spanish and English. (I asked all study questions in both languages.) In addition, I learned that children had very limited to no experience reading DLBs.

Verbal protocols. The main instrument of data collection was children’s verbal protocols. In subsequent meetings, children read aloud the selected DLBs and engaged in verbal protocols, which I audio and video recorded, to probe children’s translation and retelling strategies. Baynham and Lee (2019: 40) asserted that think-alouds/verbal protocols, which have been used to understand translators’ processes, are well suited to understand the ‘translanguaging moments’ during translation.

Because traditional verbal protocols are not typically cued (Hilden and Pressley 2011), they usually reveal general comprehension strategies. Bilinguals’ general reading strategies are already known (e.g. Jiménez et al. 1996; Hardin 2001; García and Godina 2017; LópezVelásquez and García 2017; Thibeault and Matheson 2020), but it is not known how they use their communicative repertoires and the text to translate—especially when reading DLBs whose layout has been theorized to support comprehension and linguistic comparison (Semingson et al. 2015). Therefore, to understand how readers translated and leveraged DLBs’ unique features to make meaning, I created cued verbal protocols. I planned stopping points at which I asked children either to translate a word or retell the page they had read, which probed how they made sense of the text at the word, syntax, and discourse levels (Kintsch 2013). Focusing on translation and retelling, in addition to using DLBs, allowed me to delve more deeply into readers’ processes to see how exactly children enacted translanguaging during reading.

For the translation questions, I used observations from a pilot study to choose eight words per book (four English and four Spanish). I strategically chose words that revealed translation nuances and that children were less likely to know in one language. Of these eight, children translated three words that did not have one-to-one correspondence—that is, one word translated to a phrase—such as how Francisco’s Kites/Las cometas de Francisco (Klepeis 2015) translated ‘scraps’ as ‘basura que reciclé’ (‘trash that I [the speaker] recycled’). (See Figure 1 for another example.) Children also translated three words per title with inverted word orders. In Rainbow Weaver/Tejedora del arcoíris (Marshall 2016), children translated ‘tiras’ in the phrase ‘tiras largas y finas’ to ‘strips’ in ‘long, thin strips’ (see Figure 2). Finally, children translated two words per title that had one-to-one correspondence and maintained similar word orders across languages (see Figure 3 for an example).

When I asked children to translate, I asked questions such as ‘How do you say “suddenly” in Spanish?/¿Cómo se dice “suddenly” en español?’ (Figure 1) followed by ‘How did you figure that out?/¿Cómo te diste cuenta de eso?’ or ‘Show me how you found this word [e.g. “suddenly”]./ Muéstrame cómo encontraste esta palabra’. Such questions helped me understand how they engaged in translation.

For the retelling questions, I chose four pages of each DLB and asked children to retell it. After children read the page’s first language (which for the following example is English), I said, ‘Tell me what happened on this page./Dime lo que pasó en esta página’. After reading the parallel text in Spanish, I asked, ‘¿Hay algo más que puedes decirme que pasó en la página?/Is there anything more you can tell me that happened on the page?’ If necessary to probe for more information, I asked, ‘What did you use to help you with your retelling?/¿Qué usaste para ayudarte con tu recuento?’

# Analysis

Due to limitations of verbalizing complex cognitive processes, I had to make inferences to understand how children read. Therefore, I engaged in discourse analysis to analyse not only what children said in their think-alouds, but also how they said it, such as rising intonations indicating questioning/uncertainty (Gee 2014). Through discourse analysis, I also analysed children’s gestures and body language (Kress 2011; Gee 2014), which provided information that may have been difficult to verbalize.

I transcribed what children said verbatim and transcribed prosodic elements that indicated certainty or emphasis (e.g. vocal stress or sound elongation) or uncertainty (e.g. softer speech or long pauses) using Jefferson’s (2004) prosodic transcription symbols. I also described children’s movements while answering questions, including pointing to parts of the page and head and gaze movements (such as looking at the page or ceiling). I wrote children’s movements in an adjacent column next to the corresponding verbal language because as Ochs (1979: 52) claimed, ‘nonverbal and verbal behaviours interoccur’. Further, Ochs (1979) asserted that transcribing nonverbal behaviours for children is even more important than for adults because children often rely on them more when communicating. Children’s actions were vital to communicating their strategies.

I then divided children’s responses into interactional units, or ‘a series of conversationally tied message units’ (as cited in Bloome et al. 2005: 22) because the prompt to translate a word or retell a page and all follow-up questions worked together to illuminate a particular strategy. Even if children used multiple strategies to translate or retell (which often happened), all strategies together accomplished a single goal of translating or retelling which necessitated larger units of analysis. I separated interactional units by rows on my transcript and matched them with images of the corresponding DLB page. Using information from fieldnotes, I digitally marked elements of page layout on those images, such as punctuation marks near words to be translated and alignment between words and translations, to facilitate analysis.

I used Gee’s (2014: 18) Fill-in Tool to code the data (i.e. children’s verbal responses, gestures, and analysis of text layout) because all communication requires inferences of shared knowledge.

To answer Gee’s questions of ‘what needs to be filled in here to achieve clarity?’ and ‘what is not being said overtly, but is still assumed to be known or inferable?’, I contextualized children’s responses in relation to their actions (e.g. what they pointed to), what I knew about their language and literacy backgrounds from initial interviews, and the content and placement of the text on the page. I analysed a representative subsample to create a codebook, which I used to analyse the entire data set. Code examples are provided in detail in the Findings.

A former Spanish immersion teacher and I independently coded $20 \%$ of the data. We had $8 3 . 0 4 \%$ agreement for translation codes and $9 0 . 4 8 \%$ agreement for retelling codes. Using Cohen’s kappa, we had values of 0.74 and 0.84, respectively indicating ‘substantial’ to ‘almost perfect’ (Landis and Koch 1977: 165) or ‘good’ to ‘very good’ agreement (Mahmud 2010: 188). We discussed discrepancies and reached consensus, which guided my recoding of the remaining data. Then I tallied the totals of each code to determine strategy frequencies.

# Findings

For children’s translation and retelling strategies, I present strategy frequencies, as well as descriptions of the ways in which children engaged in translanguaging to translate and retell.

# Translanguaging for translation

Children used a variety of strategies to translate, often using multiple strategies together. These strategies tended to fall in two main groups—text-based and language-based (Table 1).

Text-based strategies. Strategies were considered text-based when children used the text’s visual features to locate translations, such as using words’ general placement on the page. Children relied on these strategies heavily, $4 5 . 3 \%$ of all strategy codes, but they especially relied on words’ general location and their proximity to punctuation marks (Table 1). To exemplify these strategies, see Figure 1 in which children translated ‘suddenly’ to Spanish. Figure 1 presents an approximation of the page third graders saw, which I annotated to make strategies more apparent (Fifth graders’ pages were similar to Figures 1–3, except with more words).

To illustrate children’s use of words’ general page location/alignment, George (3-SS) said ‘suddenly’ translated to ‘de’ (instead of the correct translation ‘de pronto’) because ‘they’re almost in line’. In Figure 1, ‘de’ is directly above ‘suddenly’, and both end the paragraph’s first line. Diamond (3-ES) also used general page location/alignment when she answered ‘tiras’ ‘cause they’re kind-of lined up [pointing to “tiras” and “suddenly”], but that one’s [pointing to “tiras”] closer to it [“suddenly”]’. Like Diamond, when children used this strategy, they often drew an imaginary line with their fingers between words. Use of this strategy seems to indicate that children expected translations to physically align and mirror each other.

Children also used nearby punctuation marks such as periods, quotation marks, and exclamation marks. For example, Mandy (3-ES) said ‘suddenly’ translated to ‘de’ because both ‘de’ and ‘suddenly’ followed periods. Liliana’s (3-SS) use of periods and commas led to some confusion. First, she said the translation was ‘de’ because ‘I matched the periods again….Or…it’s “pronto”. Cause of the commas’, which was her final answer. When children relied solely upon words’ proximity to punctuation marks (thus drawing on their semiotic or sign system repertoires), they did not recognize that word orders change across languages, or as in the case of ‘suddenly’, that one word does not necessarily translate into solely one word in another language.

This (mis)conception about language was evident when children counted words across each language or matched them up one at a time, as if they expected a one-to-one correspondence between texts and translations. Juan E. (3-SS) said ‘suddenly’ translated to ‘de’, and in explanation, he touched the words ‘enojada’ and ‘angry’, followed by ‘Ixchel’ in both languages, then ‘rompió’ and ‘ripped’, continuing one word at a time in each language until reaching ‘de’ and ‘suddenly’. When Lionel (3-ES) translated ‘strips’ (Figure 2), he counted eight words across the English sentence to ‘strips’ and then eight words across the Spanish sentence to ‘y’ which he skipped because he said that ‘I know “y” is “and”’ and determined the next word ‘finas’ was ‘strips’. Thus, Lionel used his knowledge of surrounding words (described under the heading ‘language-based strategies’) and one-to-one correspondence to translate. For each of the aforementioned strategies, children physically alternated between the languages printed on the page to translate words. Like in Lionel’s case, sometimes such strategies helped children narrow down possible translations, to which they compared their knowledge of words in both languages to ultimately determine a translation.

aNumbers and percentages do not add to the total because two types of responses were not examples of translanguaging: 37 responses $( 2 . 5 \% )$ when children said, ‘I don’t know’, gave a random guess, or did not respond and 16 responses $( 1 . 1 \% ) $ coded as ‘unclear’.

For another text-based strategy, children sometimes used illustrations. When asked to translate ‘muebles’ (‘furniture’) (Figure 3), Skye (5-SS) initially guessed ‘flying’ because the main character was ‘doing a kite in the sky. And...[i]t shows like a little picture’, referencing the illustration between languages. Unlike early reading books with one short sentence per page and a matching illustration (e.g. ‘This is an apple’ with an image of an apple), these picturebooks often described multiple events per page; thus, illustrations only depicted part of the story and were not always useful when translating single words/concepts. However, pictures convey information, which children combined with language to make meaning of the text.

Finally, sometimes words were repeated on a page, which children used to find translations. In Figure 2, ‘strips’ was written twice in Spanish and three times in English on the page. Monica (5-SS) correctly translated ‘strips’ as ‘tiras’ because ‘it, says, “strips” twice. And here it says “tiras” twice’. The word ‘strips’ was also mentioned throughout the book, and Emily T. (3-ES) knew the translation was ‘tiras’ ‘cause I sort of looked at it and I also remembered it from um. Uh, the times that I read it in the past’. For this strategy of ‘repeated words’, children used their knowledge that both languages conveyed the same/similar ideas to assume that multiple occurrences of words in one language would happen in the other.

Language-based strategies. In addition to making meaning from the text’s physical characteristics, children used their linguistic knowledge, specifically depending on semantic, syntactic, phonetic, and graphophonic knowledge. Overall, children relied more on semantic strategies than other types of language-based strategies (Table 1).

They frequently used their knowledge of surrounding words’ translations to translate the word in question. Starr (5-ES) translated ‘muebles’ (Figure 3) as ‘furniture’ because ‘“comida” matches up with “food,” and…“buy” means “comprar.”’ Similarly, children used cognates near the word in question to locate the translation. In the case of ‘muebles’, recognizing ‘Francisco’ in both languages helped children determine corresponding sentences. (I counted character names/proper nouns as cognates in addition to words like ‘proyecto’/‘project’.) In such situations, children used lexical knowledge in both languages to locate the translation.

Other times, children already knew the word in question. They correctly answered the translation question without hesitation, stated they already knew the word, or described how their parents used the word (and in interviews, indicated their parents spoke the language in question). However, interestingly, sometimes children said their parents told them the word, but their interviews stated their parents did not speak Spanish. In these cases, the strategy was coded as ‘prior knowledge of translation is questioned’. It is possible parents looked up the word and shared its translation in a prior context, but people usually need multiple exposures to a word to remember it. It is also possible that stating parents said the word even if they did not speak the language helped children share their strategies when they were unsure how else to explain their processes.

The final semantic strategy children used was making lexical inferences. The word ‘suddenly’ (Figure 1) does not translate into one word in Spanish. Zeke (3-ES) determined that the translation was ‘de pronto’ ‘because, “pronto,” I think it means fast’ (and he defined ‘suddenly’ as when ‘your brain knows something quick’). Zeke also used the text-based strategy of nearby punctuation marks to help him because he said, ‘It’s the start of the sentence’.

Similarly, children used the syntactic strategy of inferring translations based on languages’ syntactic rules. Children often verbalized this as one language being ‘backwards’ from another. In contrast to the many children who erroneously translated ‘strips’ as ‘finas’ (Figure 2) because both ended the sentence, Katrina (3-ES) correctly translated it as ‘tiras’ ‘because I know in Spanish it has the “big” and the “thin” last’. Katrina’s metalinguistic knowledge that word orders differ across languages helped her translate correctly.

Children used several phonetic strategies very infrequently. First, sometimes children claimed words and their translations sounded similar. Diamond (3-ES) thought ‘strips’ (Figure 2) translated to ‘largas’ because ‘they’re kind-of together’ (thereby using the text-based strategy of alignment since ‘largas’ was directly above the first instance of ‘strips’), and she said, ‘they kind-of sound the same’, claiming the word and its translation had similar sounds. Second, children guessed made-up or unrelated Spanish and English words. Jasmine (5-ES) originally guessed ‘muebles’ was ‘marbles’ ‘because muebles kind-of sounds like marbles’. However, children made such guesses very infrequently, and in each instance, children drew upon developing linguistic conceptions. Third, one child translated a different word from what I asked, but the word rhymed. Sabrina (3-SS) thought ‘alambre’ was ‘hambre’ and responded ‘hungry’ (the meaning of ‘hambre’).

Children relied more on words’ graphophonic than phonetic properties. They assumed words and their translations would have shared letters. Max M. (3-ES) and Antonio (5-SS) said ‘strips translated to ‘tiras’ because they had the ‘same letters’ such as S, T, R, and I. Children also sometimes thought word lengths had to be similar. When asked to translate ‘suddenly’ (Figure 1), even though both ‘suddenly’ and ‘de’ began their respective sentences, multiple children thought ‘de’ was too short and stated ‘pronto’ instead. The graphophonic and phonetic strategies show the bilingual knowledge (albeit sometimes erroneous) upon which children drew to make connections across languages.

Finally, children used one strategy that accessed their discourse-/story-level knowledge—that is, context clues based on their overall knowledge of the story acquired by reading both the English and Spanish text. After Skylar (5-ES) read only the Spanish part of the page (Figure 3), without looking at the English text, she thought ‘muebles’ would be ‘remembering’ or ‘kite’ since the story described a boy missing his old home and wishing he could fly a kite. After reading the English text, Skylar correctly guessed ‘furniture’ using words’ page alignment and her knowledge of surrounding words. Constructing meaning from picturebooks at the discourse-/story-level requires accessing and integrating knowledge across named languages and sign systems, such as illustrations—strategies described further in the section below about retellings.

# Translanguaging for retelling

Children retold four pages of each DLB, one book with English first on each page and one with Spanish first. Children were asked to retell the page after reading the first language and if there were any details they wished to add after reading the second. When retelling, children’s language use was flexible. They often spoke in English regardless of the language they read; however, some retold using both languages or in the language they had just read. The content of their retellings was developed through the following translanguaging strategies.

When children retold, they relied on the English text almost $5 2 \%$ of the time. This was evident when children completely recounted the page after reading English and did not add any information after reading Spanish. Children also often repeated specific phrases from the English text in their retellings. Further, languages were widely separated on most pages so it was clear by children’s head positions in the videos which language they looked at while retelling.

Reliance on the English text is exemplified in Bob K.’s (3-ES) retelling of a book with Spanish first on the page. After reading the Spanish text, he summarized (Figure 4):

They talk in Spanish while they’re eat [sic], their favorite food. And Francisco made more kites for someone from, uh, church. And he also started a kite club. At his new school. And he hopes to own a kite shop one day.

Bob’s head movements indicated he looked at the English text at the bottom of the page, and he repeated phrases directly from the English text such as ‘he [Francisco] hopes to own a kite shop one day’. If Bob relied on the Spanish text, he likely would have translated that line as, ‘One day, he would like to have his own kite store’.

Children engaged in similar behaviours when they relied on Spanish—for example looking at the Spanish text, providing complete retellings after reading only the Spanish, and providing direct quotations or translations of the Spanish text. However, they did this relatively infrequently, only $4 . 6 \%$ of the time (Table 2), which is interesting considering that for half of their retellings, books were written with the Spanish text first. Although more children came from English-speaking homes than homes with some Spanish spoken, this low percentage indicates that even children from Spanish-speaking homes frequently relied on English and other sources of information.

Table 2: Translanguaging strategies for retelling

aNumbers and percentages do not add to the total because five responses $( 0 . 4 \% )$ coded as ‘unclear’ are not an example of translanguaging.

Children’s second most frequent retelling strategy was to describe or use information from the page’s illustration (Table 2). After Shane (3-ES) read the Spanish text first in Figure 4, he retold the page as:

Um. I think they now went to the uh, um. The. Like the dine-, no not the dining. Restaurant? Yeah, the restaurant. And. They were eating. And. I think he wanted to do this more often.

When Shane retold this page, he described the illustration—that is, Francisco and his mother eating and talking at a table in a restaurant. Shane did not seem to rely on text information because visiting the restaurant was only a small portion of what happened on the page, and Shane had difficulty thinking of the word ‘restaurant’, so it seemed he was only describing the picture. Furthermore, he inferred that Francisco might want to eat at the restaurant more frequently, which was not discussed. Similarly, sometimes children retold information that happened on other pages read previously, instead of the page in question ( $4 . 9 \%$ of codes).

Another strategy ( $1 1 . 6 \%$ of codes) was to rely on both languages sequentially by using the page’s first language to inform their retelling and adding information after reading the page’s second language. Skye (5-SS) read the Spanish text first (Figure 4) and said:

Um. I think he’s at the restaurant, and he. Um. Francisco continues and um, about talking about Sr. Marlos [Morales]. And. There’s um. Um. Maybe he might start a club for, at his new school. Like making kites and playing with them and maybe selling them.

This information was rather general; Skye did not directly repeat phrasing from the Spanish text. She also showed uncertainty through filler words like ‘um’ and hedges like ‘I think’, ‘maybe’, and ‘might’. Speaking in generalized terms with uncertainty seemed to be typical of retellings that relied on Spanish. After Skye read the English text, she added that ‘he’s [Francisco] just started a club, that he might have his own business when he grows up, but making kites’. By adding more details after reading the second language, Skye relied on both sequentially. If she had looked back and forth between languages while retelling, her strategy would have been coded as relying on both languages simultaneously.

# Discussion

This study described how biliterate children engaged in translanguaging in order to translate words and retell pages while reading DLBs. When translating, children used two types of strategies—text-based strategies for which children relied on the text’s visual aspects and language-based strategies for which children relied on linguistic knowledge. When retelling, children relied most on English text and illustrations. Children often flexibly combined strategies and drew upon everything they knew about language, meaning, and communication to translate and retell—practices fundamental to translanguaging.

Through describing bilingual children’s translanguaging practices while reading, this study extends translanguaging research in two important ways—(i) by describing the translanguaging space of reading, that is, what translanguaging during receptive language processes can entail, and (ii) by describing how readers drew upon semiotic repertoires. First, translanguaging research has largely focussed on expressive language with less attention to how bilinguals flexibly draw upon their bilingualism while reading (García and Kleifgen 2020). Although studies have established that readers mentally translate monolingual texts, leverage cognates, and respond to text questions in another language (Jiménez et al. 1996; García and Godina 2017; López-Velásquez and García 2017), the current study described the language and sign systems upon which children drew and ways they leveraged them in order to engage in tasks involved in multilingual reading— that is, translation and retelling. Having both languages in proximity in the DLB created an environment to make the mental processes involved in translanguaging while reading more visible.

The current study also extends Thibeault and Matheson’s (2020) study by providing more description of ways in which children referred to the text’s other language. Children flexibly leveraged linguistic and semiotic information to translate and retell. They combined strategies such as using words’ location or proximity to punctuation to narrow the translation possibilities and then employed their linguistic knowledge to determine a final answer. They used illustrations and linguistic knowledge to retell pages. Children’s actions were flexible and dynamic drawing upon all knowledge to make meaning, thereby exemplifying translanguaging.

Because other studies have indicated that bilinguals engaged in mental translation while reading monolingual texts (e.g. Langer et al. 1990; Jiménez et al. 1996; Hardin 2001; García and Godina 2017), it is possible that children may use some strategies identified in this study, such as relying on the illustrations, context clues, and conceptions that words have similar spellings across languages, to support their mental translations of any text. However, children also had misconceptions about how languages work, such as thinking languages use the same word order or that one word in one language directly translates to a single word in another. This has pedagogical implications related to the importance of developing metalinguistic awareness, especially in bilingual programs, to support biliteracy. DLBs could assist with that instruction (Escamilla et al. 2014).

By describing what translanguaging looks like during reading, this study extends translanguaging research in a second way—through illustrating the semiotic repertoire’s importance for translanguaging. Understanding how semiotic components function in translanguaging has often been unexplored, since much of the translanguaging research has instead focussed on language (for exception, Kusters et al. 2017; Pennycook 2017; Canagarajah 2018). In the current study, as children translated and retold, they frequently drew upon information in illustrations, page layout, and punctuation—all of which are semiotic features that communicate meaning (Kress 2010). Sometimes children relied on these elements in isolation, and other times they combined the semiotic and linguistic information to make meaning, such as using the illustration and information in the text to retell or using punctuation marks and knowledge of surrounding words’ meanings to translate. Prior research has found illustrations to be important in children’s comprehension of picturebooks (e.g. Sipe 2000). Describing how children used a text’s visual elements adds to research that seeks to understand ways in which translanguaging is ‘multisemiotic’ (Li 2018: 22).

# Considerations and conclusion

A noteworthy consideration of the study is that the majority of children came from English monolingual homes, which may skew the prevalence and types of strategies readers used. Other publications based on this study found relatively few significant differences in strategy use between home languages—other than the fact that children from Spanish-speaking homes were more likely to rely on existing knowledge for translating or on Spanish text for retelling and that children from English monolingual homes were more likely to use nearby punctuation marks to translate (Domke 2019, 2022). Future research may include more participants from homes that speak the non-English language.

Another consideration is that children read DLBs for the first time and therefore were newly making sense of this text format, which could affect their translanguaging strategies. In addition, the strategies used for translation would likely vary by languages’ orthographies, which future research could investigate.

Understanding what bilingual reading entails and how readers leverage linguistic and semiotic knowledge has long been a goal for many researchers. By using DLBs, thought to promote linguistic comparison, this study has attempted to add to those understandings, illustrating some of the ways children engage in translanguaging while reading. Young bilingual readers are strategic, and the field would benefit from further study of their processes and biliteracy development.
