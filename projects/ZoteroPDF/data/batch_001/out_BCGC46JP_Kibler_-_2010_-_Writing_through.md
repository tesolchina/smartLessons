# Abstract

Language minority students’ writing is often measured solely in terms of its distance from native speaker norms, yet doing so may ignore the process through which these texts are realized and the role that the first language plays in their creation. This study analyzes oral interactions among adolescent second language writers during an extended writing activity to address the following questions:

1. How do students use their first language(s) to broker L2 interactions with a monolingual teacher during L2 writing tasks?   
2. How do students use their first language(s) in student–student interactions to demonstrate expertise during L2 writing tasks?   
3. How do students use their first language(s) in student–student interactions to seek expertise during L2 writing tasks?

Analysis of student–teacher and student–student interactions reveals that L1 use offers strategic opportunities for student– teacher conversation and blurs traditional boundaries between ‘‘expert’’ and ‘‘novice’’ writers. Bilingual students at all levels of English language proficiency utilize the L1 to assert expertise in rhetorical, academic, linguistic, or procedural elements of the task, and students move fluidly between expert and novice roles. There are limits to students’ expertise, however, as well as the pedagogical circumstances under which the L1 can be most productively used. These findings offer insight into the writing process as it is influenced by bilingual language proficiencies and classroom interaction.

# Introduction

Diego and Zulema sit together at a table in Mr. Smith’s high school classroom after school, working on Diego’s writing assignment. Although Diego has already written down the beginning of his first topic sentence (‘‘When your factory. . .’’), he struggles to complete it:

1 Diego: es que no me acuerdo (‘it’s that I don’t remember’)   
2 ${ < } 2 >$   
3 when when your factory/come to our come to our village um

4 $< 5 >$   
5 co´mo se puede poner como you you put my family back DOWN because we we have   
(‘how could I say like’)   
6 to leave   
7   
8 our village   
9   
10 $\mathbf { S O } { = }$   
11 Zulema: =you can put um my family   
12   
13 a ver dame todas tus ideas   
(‘let’s see tell me all your ideas’)

The roles that the first language plays in this particular excerpt, allowing students to share difficulties (‘‘es que no me acuerdo’’), ask questions and/or express doubt (‘‘co´mo se puede poner’’), and help each other generate ideas ( $^ { \bullet \bullet } a$ ver dame todas tus ideas’’), are just a few of the many ways in which students in this study draw upon native language competencies to complete in-school writing or to help others do so. In such situations, the first language has the potential to be a productive affordance (van Lier, 2000) for students who are negotiating L2 writing tasks in the mainstream classroom and offers students a unique pathway toward authorship. Using data from oral interactions occurring during a single writing assignment, this study explores how four adolescent English learners, a fluentEnglish peer, and their teacher draw upon students’ first language (Spanish) during in-class writing activities in a U.S. high school.

Composition research and practice have long identified students by what they do not know, describing them as ‘‘novice’’ writers (e.g., Bridwell, 1980; Flower, 1979; Hayes, Flower, Schriver, Stratman, & Carey, 1987; Sommers, 1980); ‘‘struggling’’ readers and writers (e.g., Allington, 2005; Strickland, Ganske, & Monroe, 2002); or ‘‘basic’’ or ‘‘remedial’’ (e.g., Butler, 1980) writers at the community college or university level. These students are assumed to lack knowledge of written academic genres as well as ‘‘academic ways of knowing’’ (Zamel, 1993/1998) and ‘‘literate behaviors’’ (Blanton, 1994) expected of successful writers in the school setting. And by nearly any standardized measure of English writing proficiency, the adolescent L2 writers in this study would fall into these categories. While there is clearly pedagogical value in identifying and understanding the needs of students who have not demonstrated communicative competence in writing in a given context, the previously mentioned labels do not formally recognize the strengths that students may possess in relation to writing nor the varied and changing literacy needs they may have.

What such labels do not communicate is what students can do and in what ways their existing expertise may facilitate the writing process. From one perspective, adolescents who are labeled as ‘‘English learners’’ in U.S. secondary schools are not simply learners of a language; they are also L2 users (Cook, 2002) who employ their existing linguistic resources to access the curriculum in content areas such as science, history, and mathematics. In doing so, they draw upon what Cook (1999) describes as multicompetence, the ‘‘compound state of a mind with two languages’’ (p. 191), which is more complex and qualitatively different from monolingualism. An implication of this view is that the L1 is present in students’ minds during instructional activities, whether they speak in that language or not. As Cook (1999) notes, ‘‘the difference among activities is whether the L1 is visible or not, not whether it is present or altogether absent’’ (p. 201). While researchers, practitioners, and students hold a variety of opinions about first language use in the second language classroom (Macaro, 2005), many researchers contend that the role of the first language is often overlooked or devalued in multilingual classrooms and other settings (Brooks & Donato, 1994; Chau, 2007; Cook, 1999). Turnbull and Dailey-O’Cain (2009a) assert, however, that

despite the persistence of policies that prohibit the use of the first language, both teachers and learners are in fact using the first language in cognitively and sociolinguistically productive ways, and in every kind of classroom imaginable. (p. 14)

The role of the first language has become an increasingly important subject of research in second and foreign language instruction, with scholars investigating teachers’ and students’ codeswitching beliefs and practices in a range of settings (e.g., Turnbull & Dailey-O’Cain, 2009b). In relation to the multilingual nature of writing specifically, scholars such as Canagarajah (2006), Lee (2007), and Yi (2010) have explored how multilingual writers negotiate various social and linguistic demands when writing different types of L1 and L2 texts, while others working from psycholinguistic perspectives have analyzed how first language knowledge, writing experiences, and writing instruction may affect L2 writing (e.g., Ortega, 2009; Rinnert & Kobayashi, 2009; Sasaki, 2009).

This study, focusing on data from an extended writing assignment that four adolescent English learners and their peers completed in a grade 10 humanities classroom in the U.S., draws upon audio-recordings of oral interactions occurring during 11 writing sessions, observational fieldnotes, and multiple drafts of students’ written texts. Analysis of this data explores the ways in which first language use has the potential to facilitate communication with teachers and among students and also to allow students to demonstrate their rhetorical and linguistic expertise in relation to writing. The latter provides students with an opportunity to redefine the literate behaviors traditionally expected of novice second language authors.

In relation to multilingual classroom settings, research often addresses language brokering undertaken by bilingual speakers for the benefit of others who speak the first or second language with less facility and first language use among teachers and peers. To better understand the specific interactions occurring among participants in the study, the following sections outline insights from this research. Because the teacher in this setting was monolingual, research presented regarding L1 use in the classroom focuses on students’ use of the first language.

# Language brokering

L2 users’ roles as language brokers, or interpreters, have been examined extensively in relation to translating for family and community members (Morales & Hansen, 2005; Orellana, Dorner, & Pulido, 2003; Sanchez & Orellana, 2006; Valde´s, 2003; Vasquez, Pease-Alvarez, & Shannon, 1994), and research has suggested a relationship between higher levels of family-related language brokering and better standardized reading test scores (Dorner, Orellana, & LiGrining, 2007). Surveys have documented the pervasiveness of students’ brokering activities in and out of school (Buriel, Perez, DeMent, Chavez, & Moran, 1998; McQuillan & Tse, 1995; Tse, 1995, 1996), but relatively less is known about the roles that language brokers play in classroom communities. Bayley, Hansen-Thomas, and Langman (2005), in a linguistic analysis of language brokering in the classroom, describe a range of brokering activities undertaken in a middle school science classroom. They find that peers’ interpretations are often not direct translations of teacher talk and usually focus on small details of the task rather than the larger conceptual issues being taught. They also conclude that students lack the discipline-specific vocabulary to be effective language brokers for each other and that the brokering process does not provide students with full access to the curriculum or improved opportunities for English language acquisition.

The paucity of classroom research on peer language brokering can perhaps be attributed to a pedagogical reluctance to embrace L1 use in the classroom; from second and foreign language perspectives, prohibiting or restricting first language use is common practice, born of a concern to maximize students’ exposure to the second language and a belief that this exposure will lead to acquisition (Macaro, 2005). From a more general perspective, a pedagogical dependency on language brokering would place the instructional burden of providing comprehensible content on the student interpreter rather than the teacher.

# Peer L1 use in L2 classroom tasks

When investigating first language use in peer revision and other cooperative tasks, researchers have frequently drawn upon sociocultural frameworks to do so. According to the writings of Lev Vygotsky (e.g., 1978), whose work forms the basis of contemporary sociocultural theories, learning begins in social activity and only later becomes internal knowledge; in essence, knowledge is acquired interpersonally before it becomes internalized, and language serves as a key tool in this mental activity by allowing learners to establish relationships with others and the world (Lantolf, 2000; Lantolf & Appel, 1994; Ohta, 2000).

Studies of student discourse conducted from a sociocultural perspective find that L1 use can be an important scaffolding strategy in solving problems, managing tasks and task goals, and accessing language forms. Brooks and Donato (1994) and Brooks, Donato, and McGlone (1997), for example, find that university foreign-language students use their first languages to engage in metatalk (talk about talk), metacognition, (talk about the task), and whispered private speech. Similarly, Swain and Lapkin (2000) document eighth-grade French immersion students’ use of the L1 during cooperative tasks to move the task along and to focus attention on vocabulary and grammar. Chau (2007), DeGuerrero and Villamil (2000), and Villamil and DeGuerrero (1996) have found similar linguistic and task-related roles for the first language in classrooms. The L1 can also play an important social function by helping participants establish intersubjectivity (Anton & DeCamilla, 1998; Swain & Lapkin, 2000) or a ‘‘shared social reality and joint perspective on the task’’ (Brooks & Donato, 1994, p. 77). Using Gee’s (2005) approach to discourse analysis, Levine (2009) finds that the first language serves multiple discursive functions within the context of L2 settings.

Students often report that L1 use is a helpful tool while completing group L2 tasks (Margaret & Sonda, 2008), even when its use is minimal (Storch & Wigglesworth, 2003) or limited to mental translation (Scott & De la Fuente, 2008). In a similar vein, studies asking participants to think aloud during writing tasks – an approach typical of cognitive studies of writing – also document L2 writers’ use of the first language as they produce texts in their second languages. Through the use of think-aloud protocols, as well as retrospective interviews, questionnaires, and written compositions (e.g., Wang, 2003; Wang & Wen, 2002), psycholinguistic research in this area has investigated a range of topics, including the ways in which the L1 is used for different purposes during writing, such as planning (Wang, 2003) or backtracking (Mancho´n, Roca de Larios, & Murphy, 2000), the extent to which L1 strategies are carried into second language writing tasks (Wolfersberger, 2003), and the relative effects of translating from the L1 while writing or composing directly in the second language (Kobayashi & Rinnert, 1992). While recognizing that various theoretical and methodological concerns limit the generalizability of such findings across settings or languages, van Weijen, van den Berg, Rijlaarsdam, and Sanders (2009) contend that there is a measure of support in these studies for the notion that first language use can be beneficial in some contexts and for some writers.

The fact that L1 use in the classroom is noted among beginners (Brooks & Donato, 1994) as well as more advanced second language speakers (Swain & Lapkin, 1998) attests to the important cognitive role that L1 use may play (Lantolf, 2005) and the social importance of first language use among peers working together in the classroom. An important caveat to these conclusions, however, is that much of the empirical research on peer L1 use has been conducted in university or immersion settings, in the context of language courses and explicitly cooperative pedagogical tasks.

Drawing upon the notion that the first language has the potential to be a beneficial resource in second language writing – a conclusion shared by researchers working from both psycholinguistic and sociocultural perspectives – the data analyzed here are unique in that a sociocultural framework is used to address the extent to which such findings may be relevant to adolescent peer L1 use in content-area classes as students complete writing tasks that may not be overtly designed as collaborative activities.

# The study

This analysis follows four Latino adolescents of upper beginning to intermediate English proficiency levels, along with a fluent English-speaking bilingual peer, as they complete writing tasks in their grade 10 mainstream humanities class, an interdisciplinary course that combines world history and language arts and is taught by a monolingual English speaker, Mr. Smith. Oral interactions among students and between students and teachers are analyzed to address the following questions:

1. How do students use their first language(s) to broker L2 interactions with a monolingual teacher during L2 writing tasks?   
2. How do students use their first language(s) in student–student interactions to demonstrate expertise during L2 writing tasks?   
3. How do students use their first language(s) in student–student interactions to seek expertise during L2 writing tasks?

An interest in students’ communicative competence (Hymes, 1971) and a conviction that language learning also involves the acquisition of genre-specific knowledge (Hyland, 2004) led me to observe writing activities in contentarea classes in order to examine how disciplinary knowledge and teacher expectations shaped the linguistic and cultural knowledge students were expected to know or learn. Additionally, a social orientation toward language acquisition processes – influenced by researchers in SLA (e.g., Firth & Wagner, 1997; Lafford, 2007) as well as sociocultural theory (Lantolf, 2000; Vygotsky, 1978) – resulted in a decision to complete audio-recorded, qualitative observations that carefully examined how focal students used language with peers and teachers in the service of accomplishing a variety of classroom tasks. Finally, in order to ascertain the extent to which various classroom resources might have served as affordances for students as they wrote, students’ oral interactions during writing were recorded and multiple written drafts were collected throughout the writing process.

# Setting

The focal students attend South Sierra High School, located in the coastal northern California community of South Sierra.1 Almost two-thirds of the residents speak a home language other than English, and almost half are foreignborn, according to the most recent U.S. Census. Of the 23 students in Mr. Smith’s humanities class, all but two – both African Americans – speak a home language other than English. With the exception of one Tongan and one Fijian student, the rest of the multilingual students in the class are Spanish speakers of Mexican origin. Similar demographic patterns exist at both the school and community level, with the addition of small numbers of Samoan, Hindi, and Mandarin speakers.

Teachers and administrators at South Sierra have encountered a range of pedagogical, organizational, and fiscal challenges faced by the legions of schools serving diverse populations. South Sierra differs from many such schools, however, in two regards. First, following a strict no-tracking policy, the school has placed second language learners at all proficiency levels in mainstream courses, offering students potential access to grade-level curriculum but also forcing teachers to face the challenge of adapting their instruction for a wide range of students. Second, many of South Sierra’s teachers encourage or at least allow first language use by Spanish speakers in a variety of academic and social situations, an unofficial pedagogical position that runs counter to those of many schools in the state. First language use, like access to grade-level mainstream courses, offers opportunities for expanded access to the curriculum but also challenges teachers and students to use such resources as productively as possible.

South Sierra offers an interesting sociolinguistic context in which to see the role of first language use in the composition process. Classroom and other school observations show that among Spanish speakers, who make up almost $80 \%$ of the school population, the most common languages of interaction are Spanish or codeswitching between Spanish and English. In this sense, Spanish and Spanish/English codeswitching are used as the medium for everyday peer interactions; they are the ‘‘unmarked’’ linguistic codes (Myers-Scotton, 2006) among these students. As a result, it is not surprising to find that students also employ their native language resources while negotiating academic tasks (Cook, 2001; Levine, 2003), and while first language use is a natural way of talking in this setting, it also has strategic benefits in relation to writing and other academic tasks.

# Participants

This study focuses on interactions occurring during the course of this assignment among the teacher, four focal students (Zulema, Jaime, Fabiola, and Diego), and another peer, Cynthia, who interacts with Diego during this writing activity. Selection of focal students was based upon the following criteria:

1. They scored at the two lowest proficiency levels in writing on the California English Language Development Test.   
2. They were enrolled by teacher recommendation in an English language development and/or bilingual humanities course during the previous school year.   
3. The school had collected assessment data and writing samples for these students since ninth grade.   
4. These students were placed in the same humanities class, which allowed for a deeper exploration of classroom context.

Of the four focal students, Zulema and Jaime have attended U.S. schools for a significant portion of their academic careers (4 and 7 years, respectively). Fabiola and Diego, in contrast, have had relatively fewer years of education in the U.S. (1 and 2 years, respectively). Once in U.S. schools, these students have been placed in English-medium ESL or mainstream classrooms. Cynthia, born in the U.S. but raised in a Spanish-speaking family, was reclassified by the school district as ‘‘fluent English proficient’’ in elementary school and has been enrolled in mainstream classes since that time. Mr. Smith, the students’ current humanities teacher, is in his fourth year teaching, but this is the first time he has taught second language writers.

# The writing task

As part of a larger ethnographic study of these students’ writing experiences across the curriculum,2 data for this article focus on an extended writing assignment undertaken in the students’ humanities course during an interdisciplinary unit focusing on industrialization. After having completed two weeks of classroom activities and historical readings about industrialization in Europe, students began reading the novel Nectar in a Sieve (Markandaya, 1954), the story of a female protagonist and her family coping with the arrival of industrialization in mid-20th century India. Class time was spent reading silently and completing group tasks about each chapter of the novel.

Students’ writing task, based upon the novel, was to assume one character’s point of view and write a letter to another character, explaining her opinions about industrialization’s benefits and disadvantages based on her life experience. Subsequent to prewriting activities, students drafted their letters primarily in class, either by hand or on computers, and although there was no writing conference structure in place, Mr. Smith was available during class and after school to answer students’ individual questions. Throughout this article, these unplanned teacher–student interactions about the writing task are referred to as ‘‘informal conferences.’’

During time provided for in-class writing, students also spontaneously engaged in a range of peer interactions about the writing task. Classroom observations indicate that some of Mr. Smith’s students had been exposed to structured cooperative peer activities in courses the previous academic year, but during the academic year in which this writing assignment was completed, Mr. Smith did not provide students with any explicit instruction related to working with peers or revising writing.3

# Data collection and analysis

Data collection involved the gathering of a wide variety of data sources, reflecting the belief found in ethnographic research that ‘‘multiple perspectives enable a more valid description of complex social realities than any single kind of data could alone’’ (Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999, p. 49). For this writing task, fieldnotes and audio-recordings were made for 11 out of 18 writing sessions that occurred in class or during after-school tutorials, each lasting between 25 and 90 minutes. Focal students were audio-recorded, two at a time, on a rotating daily basis, and observations focused on those students being recorded. Audio data were transcribed and refined using the assistance of a native Spanishspeaking graduate student in linguistics. Data analysis proceeded in keeping with a bottom-up approach to analysis (Lampert & Ervin-Tripp, 1993).

In undertaking what I call an ‘‘interactional histories analysis,’’ the study uses insights from interactional sociolinguistics (Gumperz, 1982) and intertextual analysis (Prior, 2004) to analyze students’ oral interactions during writing instruction and the texts they subsequently wrote. Audio data were analyzed according to the perspective that talk is interactive in nature (Gumperz & Berenz, 1993) and that detailed sequential analyses can illuminate the ‘‘local moves and countermoves’’ of participants in these speech exchanges (p. 95). These shifts include the moment-tomoment changes in alignment that speakers and hearers take toward each other and the content of their talk (Hoyle & Adger, 1998), changes which Goffman (1981) refers to as ‘‘footing.’’ In keeping with this outlook, the basic unit of analysis was the ‘‘speaking turn,’’ which Gumperz and Berenz (1993) define as an utterance that is produced by a speaker and bounded by other participants’ turns (p. 95). In these data, turns often signal changes in speakers’ language use and footing in relation to the writing tasks. Following an interactional sociolinguistic framework (Gumperz, 1982), this type of analysis focuses not simply on the structure of conversational turns but also on how these interactions both reflect and create the social settings in which participants are embedded.

In relation to students’ written texts, an intertextual analysis (Prior, 2004) complemented audio data by documenting the relationships between classroom talk and multiple drafts of students’ texts. Such an approach is particularly useful in understanding the ways in which teachers and students manage one-on-one informal conferences about writing, the ways in which students use their first languages to demonstrate expertise and solicit information from peers, and the impact these interactions have on students’ texts.

An initial review of fieldnotes and audio transcripts clearly demonstrated that the phenomena of peer L1 use for brokering or sharing expertise was by far the most common form of academic interaction among students during the eleven writing sessions. In subsequent analysis, transcripts were coded for the following trends in students’ use of the L1 to

1. Broker L2 situations between peers and teachers;   
2. Demonstrate expertise;   
3. Seek expertise.

Each of these trends was further subdivided into one of the following four topics that participants discussed: (1) task, (2) language, (3) factual/conceptual content issues, or (4) rhetorical issues. The first two sub-categories – task and language – are similar to those categories found in Brooks and Donato (1994), Brooks et al. (1997), and Swain and Lapkin (2000). The latter two categories – content and rhetorical issues – are more specific to the nature of contentarea writing.

# Findings and discussion

Research question one is addressed in the first half of the findings section, which focuses on the phenomenon of language brokering. Examples in this section have been selected to demonstrate the typical challenges that occur in language–brokering interactions as well as the types of opportunities brokering provides for students to demonstrate their expertise or solicit assistance from others. The second half of the findings section addresses research question two and provides representative examples of the expert and novice roles students assume and the types of expertise each student shares or seeks in these interactions through the use of Spanish.

Language brokering around the teacher: the case of Diego

In my observations and recordings of classroom writing activities, only one of the focal students – Diego – is involved in receiving help through language brokering interchanges. Such a pattern is not surprising: Diego scored at beginning levels in listening and speaking on English language proficiency tests the year before, and he regularly asks for help from his teachers. This desire for interaction with his teachers, coupled with his incipient language skills, makes language brokering an important aspect of teacher–student conversations, at least in his humanities class, where brokering is present in over one-third of the informal conferences in which Diego is engaged.

Analysis of these interchanges between Diego, his peers, and Mr. Smith makes it apparent that neither Diego nor Mr. Smith seek out the most orally sophisticated L2 users as language brokers. Students take on this role due to happenstance and social relationships: During writing activities students can sit with whomever they wish, and students who act as language brokers, either on their own volition or at Mr. Smith’s request, are those sitting next to Diego when he and Mr. Smith talk with each other. The only exception to this pattern is an after school writing session that Mr. Smith asks Zulema to attend so that she can act as an interpreter if needed.

# Affordances of language brokering

As the following transcripts will demonstrate, more knowledgeable L2 peers can provide affordances in facilitating conversations between Diego and his monolingual teacher, allowing Diego opportunities to generate ideas for writing through his first language. In the following excerpt, which is representative of these successful mediated interactions, Cynthia, a young woman whom Diego knows and with whom he often chooses to sit, provides unsolicited help for Diego at critical points in his interaction with Mr. Smith through her use of English and Spanish.

In the following excerpt, Diego has just received feedback on the introductory paragraph of the first draft of his letter (shown in Fig. 1), which he has written from the perspective of Ruku, the protagonist and family matriarch of Nectar in a Sieve. Diego raises his hand to ask about the question Mr. Smith has asked on the paper.

Mr. Smith reads the question aloud and asks Diego orally how Ruku might feel because her daughter Ira was a prostitute, to which Diego replies, ‘‘bad.’’ Mr. Smith repeats the question, and there is a pause of several seconds, but he is not able to elicit any further information from Diego. The conversation then continues:

1 Mr. Smith: well think about it just [in general   
2 Cynthia: [how would it affect your family like people will start   
3 talking about your family or your sister and stuff so your family is gonna feel   
4 bad   
5 Diego: $p$ 's si because like other people say no your sister is a prostitute and she's doing   
( well yeah')   
6 this and this   
7 Mr.Smith: ok

Transcript 2a

In this first excerpt from the conversation, it is Cynthia’s second language capacities which provide the first affordance for Diego; in lines 2–4 she enters the conversation in English to offer Diego an expanded version of his earlier utterance (‘‘bad’’), adding the new idea that the family will feel bad because they are being talked about. Diego’s response shows a shift in the linguistic frame of the conversation, in which he uses Spanish to acknowledge his understanding of her English explanation (line 5) and then uses English to expand upon Cynthia’s ideas, giving an example of what people might say (‘‘no your sister is a prostitute and she’s doing this and this,’’ lines 5–6).

While this series of interchanges generates new details for Diego’s writing, it is not until Cynthia and Diego utilize their first language that Diego’s more sophisticated meaning becomes clear. Immediately following the previous excerpt, Diego continues, first speaking to Mr. Smith, and then, while his teacher is dealing with an interruption elsewhere in the classroom, to Cynthia.

8 Diego so I think they think like the other people thinking bad of the family because   
9 ((Mr.Smith turns attention toward another student.Diego turns to Cynthia.))   
10 que no que no que no que no apoyan a su familia que otras that that that they don't provide a good foundation for their family that other   
11 personas y otras familias piensan mal de ellos porque de los padres (people and other families think badly of them because of the parents')   
12 por que no no educan aja a su a su hija (because they don't don't educate uhuh their their daughter)   
13 se puede decir esol (can you say it that way/)   
14 Cynthia: no es una no es un trabajo (eso) (it's not a that's not a job)   
15 Diego: aja tambien uhuh that too   
16 Mr.Smith (returning his attention to Diego)) so people are talk[ing about   
17 Cynthia people are probably   
18 thinking bad about them and they'll say that their parents didn't um educate   
19 them well   
20 Mr. Smith: ok so the family has become SUBJECT of RIDICULE and discussion so   
21 PEOPLE in the village are talking about them all the time right/   
22 <1>   
23 that's not good so maybe you could write a sentence about that to help show   
24 how it's impacted the family

Transcript 2b

In Diego’s first utterance (line 8), he is largely repeating what he has said earlier and has yet to generate substantively new ideas. It is not until Mr. Smith is called away that Diego addresses Cynthia, explaining in Spanish a concrete example of what people might say about the family: people in the community will criticize the family for not providing their children with an adequate foundation or upbringing (lines 10–13). This idea, one that has not yet been mentioned by the teacher or Diego’s peers, represents a move forward in the writing of Diego’s text. Significantly, it is only through Cynthia’s understanding and translation (lines 17–19) that Diego’s idea is legitimized by the teacher. Mr. Smith affirms and rephrases Cynthia’s utterance (lines 20–24), but it is unclear how much of Mr. Smith’s recast Diego comprehends. When he writes a sentence about these ideas a few moments later, he incorporates language from Cynthia’s translation rather than Mr. Smith’s rephrasing. Utilizing an additional suggestion from Cynthia – that he use the word ‘‘criticize,’’ a word which she also spells for him, instead of saying ‘‘talk bad about’’ – Diego changes his introductory paragraph to the following in his typewritten draft, in which his new content is highlighted:

Is your daughter a prostitute?My name is Ruku and i have a daughter that is a prostitute. This has affected my family because people in the village criticize us saying that we don’t educate our children well. I’m riding this letter to convince the owners of this tannery that Industrialization has caused major problems for my family and village.

Cynthia is an invaluable affordance in helping Diego create this new version of the text, which contains a more complex introduction than Diego was able to produce without her mediation of the teacher–student conversation. This language brokering highlights the fact that Diego is not a solitary author (Bourne, 2002); his composing process is mediated by two other people in this instance, both the teacher and Cynthia, the former requesting additional information and the latter helping Diego express his ideas. In writing his new sentence, Diego draws heavily upon Cynthia’s language, but his textual borrowing operates at a linguistic level only. Conceptually, the ideas are his own, and Cynthia’s language allows him to express his idea in written English.

# Limitations of language brokering

A parallel example occurring between these same participants a few days later, however, provides a cautionary reminder: The potential of this affordance cannot be realized without shared understandings about writing and teaching practices that take advantage of language brokering opportunities. In this excerpt, Diego calls Mr. Smith to his table to look at another sentence he has revised in response to a comment Mr. Smith has written on a newer, typewritten draft. The sentence and Mr. Smith’s comment, which is indicated with parentheses and quotation marks, are

My village think about my family that prostitution is not a good job to get that is a bad job, but me and my family we feel bad that people are say in that we are not a good parents to are family. (‘‘This is an important sentence but needs to be rewritten so that it is more clear. How might you rewrite this to be more clear?’’)

The rewritten sentence that Diego then produces, ‘‘The people in the village think we didn’t give our daughter a good education because of the job she has,’’ is quite similar to the sentence he created for his introduction in the earlier example, but in this case it is used as a supporting detail in a body paragraph. After reading this new sentence, Mr. Smith begins to ask Diego further questions about how the family feels about this disrespect from their neighbors. Mr. Smith asks Cynthia to translate these questions for him, and she does so. Diego’s response in Spanish soon moves into new territory:

1 Diego: pos si pues pues nos sentiriamos mal no nos podriamos como (well yes well well we would feel bad we would not be able to like)   
2   
3 como se llamal how do you say it/)

16 Mr. Smith: [mm good right=   
17 Cynthia: $=$ and make them feel bad=   
18 Mr. Smith: =right   
Transcript 3a

Similar to the previous example, the ideas that Diego expresses in Spanish – that the family would not even want to leave the house because neighbors would make fun of them or complain to them (lines 6–8 and 11) – represent new insight into the situation and additional specific information he can add to his writing. Cynthia explains the idea in English to Mr. Smith (lines 12–15), who then affirms Diego’s interpretation (lines 16 and 18), following the same pattern of interaction as occurred in the previous example.

As the conversation continues, Mr. Smith recasts Diego’s ideas, as he did before, and asks him to write them down. A miscommunication occurs, however, when Diego then asks about erasing Mr. Smith’s written feedback, which appeared in orange ink on the original document:

$3 1 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { M r }$ Smith so the next sentence try to write the next sentence where you're telling   
32 how it impacted you because of this great sentence here   
33 ${ < } 2 . 5 >$   
34 Diego: so now we can erase this one/   
35 Mr.Smith: which one   
36 Cynthia: the orange   
37Mr.Smith the orange/ [yes   
38 Diego: [((reading)this this is an im[portant sentence   
39 Mr.Smith [yes

Transcript 3b

In lines 31–32, Mr. Smith asks Diego to write an additional sentence, building on the ‘‘great’’ (line 32) sentence Diego has already revised, one that reflects the new ideas he has just generated. However, the pause at line 33 signals a change in the conversation: The question Diego subsequently asks (‘‘so now we can erase this one/,’’ line 34) does not directly relate to Mr. Smith’s request. Instead, Diego wants to know if he has permission to erase the written comment from Mr. Smith that prompted the initial revision. Mr. Smith agrees that it can be erased and leaves Diego and Cynthia in order to help another student across the room. After Mr. Smith leaves, however, Diego does not attempt to add a new sentence. Instead, he moves on to the next typewritten comment from Mr. Smith.

In this situation, Cynthia’s L2 expertise allows Diego to share ideas with the teacher, but because Mr. Smith and Diego have interpreted the interaction differently, Diego’s ideas are never transferred to paper. Based on Mr. Smith’s reaction to Diego’s question (lines 37 and 39), he believes that Diego will both add the sentence and delete the comment. Diego’s actions afterward, however, indicate one of two possibilities. One alternative is that Diego may have been unable to comprehend Mr. Smith’s directive (lines 31–32). While this is possible, it seems somewhat unlikely, since Diego was able to follow similar oral instructions in Transcript 2b. The other alternative is that Diego interprets Mr. Smith’s oral suggestion as optional and the typewritten comments as those that are essential to address. These differing perspectives on revision, and the fact that Mr. Smith does not recognize the possible implications of Diego’s pause and subsequent question (lines 33–39), illustrate the complexities of revision and feedback, especially when interactions are mediated through multiple languages and participants.

In both of the interactions among Cynthia, Diego, and Mr. Smith appearing in this data, another limitation of language brokering is evident. It could be argued that Cynthia’s brokering, although it clearly facilitates Diego’s writing, does not fully reflect the specificity and complexity of language Diego offers in his Spanish explanations. In the first instance (Transcript 2b), Cynthia’s translation only partially renders Diego’s idea. He explains the perception that the parents in the novel ‘‘no apoyan a su familia/don’t provide a good foundation for their family’’ and that ‘‘no educan. . .a su hija/they don’t educate their daughter.’’ Cynthia only communicates the latter idea for Mr. Smith, however, and it is only this latter phrase that Diego then incorporates into his text. The nuance of the term ‘‘educar,’’ which can refer to people’s upbringing as well as their formal education, is arguably lost in Cynthia’s translation. In the second interaction presented in this section (Transcript 3a), Cynthia also summarizes Diego’s ideas; he mentions that members of the family would fear leaving their house because others ‘‘se van a carcajear/are going to howl with laughter’’ or ‘‘van a estar. . .reclama´ndonos/are going to be . . . judging us.’’ Cynthia interprets these ideas as ‘‘somebody would laugh at them [and] talk bad about them.’’ From this perspective, such findings could be seen as consistent with Bayley et al.’s (2005) conclusions that language brokers may lack academic vocabulary in the topics discussed in the classroom, thereby limiting peers’ potential to provide English learners with curricular access or language development.

a The examples for each knowledge type demonstrate the range of knowledge held by the students; they do not suggest that each student demonstrating expertise in that domain necessarily knew all of the exemplars listed.

Yet considering the multiple linguistic and cognitive demands placed upon language brokers in these situations, Cynthia’s selection and rephrasing can also be seen as logical and strategic methods of brokering communication. Moreover, Cynthia’s role in the conversation is clearly facilitative, encouraging Diego to generate new ideas and to share them in some way with his teacher, who would otherwise not have access to Diego’s thought processes. In this sense, language brokers can help less sophisticated L2 users at critical points during challenging content-area writing tasks, facilitating the moments when comprehension has the potential to break down between monolingual teachers and English learners without guidance from language brokers.

Summary: language brokering and content-area writing

In an assessment of the roles that language brokering plays in the preceding examples, it is clear that L1 use changes expectations for both the content and the ‘‘doing’’ of in-school writing, highlighting the fact that writing is shaped by classroom interaction. In relation to content, Diego’s ideas are not simply transferred from thought to paper; the realization of his ideas requires both the bilingual proficiency of the language broker and the opportunity afforded by their interaction. Language brokering offers another vision of the ‘‘literate behaviors’’ (Blanton, 1994) expected of language minority writers, challenging both the idea of the solitary author and the traditional notion of teacher–student dyadic conversations about writing. In language brokering settings, another ‘‘author’’ is introduced, or introduces herself, into the interaction. The broker plays a significant role in shaping the conversation and the language used in students’ eventual writing. In this case, the presence of ‘‘the words of others’’ (Bakhtin, 1986, p. 93) represents a repetition and recycling of language made available through the contributions of both the student writer and the language broker.

Sharing and eliciting expertise through L1 use: the case of Zulema, Fabiola, and Jaime

A prominent pattern in the data is that all focal students use their first language with peers to switch easily between novice and expert roles. Inthis South Sierra classroom, focal studentsactboth as novices, appealing to peers for help,and as experts, demonstrating their knowledge about the specific writing task, the academic content they are asked to draw from, general writing craft (which is referred to as rhetorical knowledge in Table 1 above), and/or appropriate linguistic forms.

As Table 1 indicates, all students demonstrate expertise in at least one aspect of writing-related knowledge, with Zulema doing so in all four categories (task, academic content, rhetorical form, and linguistic form), Fabiola in three (task, academic content, and rhetorical form), Diego in two (rhetorical form and linguistic form), and Jaime in one (linguistic form). Each of the four students also seeks help from others, often assuming both expert and novice roles in relation to the same type of knowledge. The relative fluidity with which students move between expert and novice footing has been documented in other studies of peer interaction as well, both in native-language classrooms (DiPardo & Freedman, 1988) and L2 settings (Anton & DeCamilla, 1998; Goldstein & Conrad, 1990; Kowal & Swain, 1994; Ohta, 1995).

The following excerpt occurs halfway through the drafting process, as students are sitting in self-selected groups around Mr. Smith’s room. Fabiola solicits Zulema’s help with her writing, but the addition of Jaime to the group offers both Fabiola and Jaime opportunities to share their respective expertise. The interchange begins when Fabiola asks Zulema (in Spanish) for help in developing a good topic sentence for her third body paragraph, and after Zulema reads a portion of Fabiola’s draft, their conversation continues.5

<html><body><table><tr><td>1 Zulema:</td><td>pues a ver cuantos llevas (well let&#x27;s see how many you have&#x27;)</td><td>Zulema looks at Fabiola&#x27;s paper to count her paragraphs and asks her a</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>xx) uno dos (one two)</td><td rowspan="4">question.</td></tr><tr><td>3 Fabiola:</td><td>esperame (wait)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>&lt;5&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>nada mas llevo dos (I only have two)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>esa es la introduccion (that&#x27;s the introduction&#x27;)</td><td rowspan="4">Zulema asks Fabiola about what she</td></tr><tr><td>7 Zulema:</td><td>mmhm pero cuales son tus cosas but what are the things</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>que vas a ha[cer</td></tr><tr><td>9 Jaime:</td><td>(that you are going to do) [&#x27;ira (se supone) que</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>(look are we supposed to) escribir de la Rukumanil</td><td rowspan="2">conversation, talking over Zulema to ask Fabiola if they are supposed to write the letter about the character Rukumani.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>(write about Rukmani/&#x27;)</td></tr><tr><td>12 Fabiola:</td><td>pero le vas a escribir a ella (but you&#x27;re going to write to her)</td><td rowspan="2">Fabiola asks Jaime whose character he would assume if he were going to write a letter to Rukumani.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>de parte de quien ( from whose perspective&#x27;)</td></tr><tr><td>14 Jaime:</td><td>como como lo vas (x) dejame ver (how how are you going to (x) let me see)</td><td>Jaime asks to see her paper but doesn&#x27;t reach for it.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>que QUIERES (what DO YOU WANT)</td><td>Jaime shouts across the room to other students.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>&lt;4&gt;</td><td>Jaime looks at his own paper.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>una hermana o no a ver (a sister or not lets see&#x27;)</td><td>Jaime talks to himself about whether he will assume the character of the sister.</td></tr><tr><td>18 Zulema:</td><td>cual cual es la que esta haciendo economy/ (what what is it you&#x27;re doing)</td><td rowspan="2">Zulema asks Fabiola if her new paragraph will be about the economy.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>..</td></tr><tr><td>20 Jaime:</td><td>let me read yours esta es tuya Zulema! (is this yours Zulema/)</td><td>Jaime sees a paper on the desk, turns it toward him, and asks to read it</td></tr></table></body></html>

Fabiola’s invitation sets up the conversation as a collaborative, rather than competitive, endeavor, and Zulema maintains a ‘‘probing’’ stance, acting as a questioner to clarify how many body paragraphs Fabiola already has (lines 1 and 2) and what topics she still wants to address (lines 7 and 8). This interaction has the potential to be useful for both Fabiola and Zulema; for peers engaged in collaborative L2 writing tasks, collaborative and probing stances have been found to be more productive and more likely to lead to improved outcomes than evaluative or uninvolved stances (DeGuerrero & Villamil, 2000; Lockhart & Ng, 1995; Mangelsdorf & Schlumberger, 1992; Nelson & Murphy, 1993; Storch, 2001, 2002a, 2002b; Watanabe & Swain, 2007).

Jaime’s entry into the conversation, however, signals a change in footing: He addresses Fabiola as an expert, confirming with her what he needs to do to begin the assignment (‘‘look are we supposed to write about Rukumani,’’ lines 9 and 10). In keeping with this request, Fabiola switches from novice to expert footing (lines 12 and 13), asking him which character’s perspective he will take in the letter. Jaime asks for help again (line 14) but is distracted by activities across the room. In line 17, however, Jaime responds to Fabiola’s utterance, using his first language to engage in private speech (Brooks & Donato, 1994; Villamil & DeGuerrero, 1996) as he plans his letter.

Zulema re-asserts her expert role in line 18 as she continues to ask Fabiola about the topic of her third paragraph, while Jaime continues to seek guidance with his writing, this time by reading what he thinks is Zulema’s letter (line 20), which is actually Fabiola’s. Fabiola and Zulema continue their conversation while Jaime reads the letter, a text that all three are looking at simultaneously:

Transcript 4b   

<html><body><table><tr><td>26 Zulema:</td><td>ok tu primer parrafo es de! (your first paragraph is about/)</td><td>Zulema asks Fabiola about her first paragraph.</td></tr><tr><td>27 28 Fabiola:</td><td>&lt;1&gt; introduccion pero lo voy a cambiar (introduction but I&#x27;m going to change it)</td><td>Fabiola answers her question.</td></tr><tr><td>29 Zulema: 30 Fabiola:</td><td>[ok [el segundo es de=</td><td>Fabiola continues her answer.</td></tr><tr><td>31 Jaime:</td><td>(the second is about=&#x27;) =de que es ((reading) I miss you/</td><td>Jaime looks at Fabiola, points to her</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>(=what is this about)</td><td>paper, and questions what she wrote.</td></tr><tr><td>33 Fabiola:</td><td>creo no se no [me (I think I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t)</td><td>Fabiola responds to Jaime.</td></tr><tr><td>34 Jaime:</td><td>[no lleva la t&quot; it doesn&#x27;t have at</td><td>Jaime explains to Fabiola the error he has found.</td></tr><tr><td>35 Fabiola:</td><td>o[h</td><td>Fabiola responds to Jaime.</td></tr><tr><td>36 Zulema:</td><td>[ok del (&#x27;about&#x27;)</td><td>Zulema reinitiates conversation with Fabiola.</td></tr><tr><td>37 Fabiola:</td><td>Diego me (x) que se escribe asi</td><td>Fabiola responds to Jaime.</td></tr><tr><td>38 Jaime:</td><td>(Diego (x) me it&#x27;s written like that) no no asi no not like that</td><td>Jaime points to the paper and</td></tr></table></body></html>

In this second half of the conversation, it is Jaime who asserts his expertise. In contrast to Zulema and Fabiola’s collaborative interactions, Jaime, who has not been officially ‘‘invited’’ into the conversation but is nonetheless a recognized participant, takes an evaluative stance toward Fabiola’s writing. He draws upon his linguistic knowledge of English grammar to correct a mistake in Fabiola’s letter (lines 31, 34, and 38) by pointing out that the word ‘‘miss’’ does not have a ‘‘t’’ at the end of it (no lleva la ‘‘t’’).6 Fabiola’s response (line 37) hints at yet another situation in which peers act as experts for each other: She claims it was Diego who originally provided the spelling for her. After Jaime’s final comment (line 38), Fabiola erases the ‘‘t’’ from her paper, with Jaime looking on and nodding in approval.

Individual student characteristics influence how Fabiola and Jaime display expertise in this set of transcripts. Jaime, for example, has had much more exposure to English than Fabiola, but he has not completed any of the prewriting activities up to this point in time, tasks which might have provided him with knowledge about the writing task. Fabiola’s grammatical knowledge may not be as strong as Jaime’s, but she has already completed over half of her draft with little guidance from the teacher, implying an understanding of how to undertake this writing assignment.

In an additional encounter between the two later that day, Fabiola’s content-related and rhetorical knowledge become evident as well. When this interaction occurs, I am sitting with Jaime, who has asked me for help in deciding which character’s perspective he will assume in writing the letter. Fabiola, sitting nearby, joins the conversation to offer Jaime a detailed plan for the main argument of the letter:

1 Researcher: so what what would Ruku be persuading her to do I guess that's [what I'm   
2 Jaime: [to stop being a   
3 prostitute   
4 Fabiola: uuhuh   
5 Researcher: oh ok ok that's a good idea let's go with that   
6 Jaime: uh[huh   
7 Fabiola: [le puede tu argumento puede ser que es un progress porque le le puede decir it could your argument could be that it's a because it it can say)   
8 OOH fijate que en la industrialization ya I mean puedes trabajar y (look that in the') you can work now and   
9 t-puedes dejar de hacer eso ya le damos oportunidad a las mujeres o lo que sea (y- you can stop doing that we now give opportunities to women or something)

Jaime has decided that he will write from the perspective of Ruku, the mother, to Ira, her daughter, and has outlined a basic proposition for the letter (telling her daughter ‘‘to stop being a prostitute,’’ lines 2 and 3) when Fabiola enters the conversation to propose a detailed argument for the letter (lines 7–9). She suggests that Ruku tell her daughter that industrialization has brought work and opportunities for women, and as a result her daughter does not need to work as a prostitute anymore. In offering this unsolicited suggestion, Fabiola draws upon her knowledge of the major themes of the novel – industrialization and women’s changing roles in society – and while there are certain flaws in her argument (since there are few industrial jobs that Ira would be able to take unless she were to leave her village), her utterances nonetheless demonstrate her knowledge of the book and of how to support an argument.

Later in the class period, Fabiola continues to offer advice to Jaime, rejecting her own initial argument and then suggesting three other arguments he could use. Jaime is relatively silent during Fabiola’s 3-minute long brainstorming session, although he listens attentively. After he agrees to switch his point of view, now writing from the daughter to the mother, Fabiola offers the following advice:

1 Fabiola: so um le puedes decir eso y luego ya le puedes decir oh pues ahora que este (you can say that to her and later you can say to her oh well now that this')   
2 Kenny termino de hacer el hospital ya tengo trabajo ya no hago eso ya o (Kenny finished building the hospital I have a job now I don't do that anymore or')   
3 lo que sea na mas escribe ideas y haz ese parafo de cada idea ('something like that just write ideas and make that paragraph from each idea)   
4 Jaime: ya:h alright   
5   
6 Fabiola de esa Ruku no entendiste ni nada. (you didn't understand Ruku's situation or anything else')   
7 Jaime: como nol tu sabes tu sabes (of course/ you know you know').   
8 Fabiola: pues por eso porque [por eso (well that's why because that's why)   
9 Jaime: [tu sabes (you know)   
10 $< 3 . 5 >$   
11 to Ruku   
12 <4>   
13 Fabiola: pon ((playfully)) my lovely mommy (write')   
14 Jaime: dea:r mom

Transcript 6

In addition to suggesting a specific argument (lines 1 and 2), Fabiola also offers advice about the craft of writing, telling Jaime to ‘‘na’ ma´s escribe ideas y haz ese pa´rafo de cada idea/just write ideas and make that paragraph from each idea’’ (line 3). In both Transcripts 5 and 6, Fabiola’s L1 usage allows her to share her content-related and rhetorical knowledge, a resource Jaime draws upon to begin his letter writing (Transcript 6, lines 11 and 14).

This latter interaction also highlights the fact that Jaime seeks others’ expertise in this writing task not necessarily because of his English language proficiency. Earlier that day, Jaime has told Fabiola he did not read Nectar in a Sieve, but when Fabiola chides him for not knowing anything about the main character (lines 6 and 8), his repeated response (‘‘tu sabes/you know,’’ lines 7 and 9) does not immediately reveal why he did not do so. Most likely, a combination of his lack of motivation to attend to the task and his challenges with English reading comprehension can help to explain this situation; during this assignment, Jaime knows that he is about to transfer to another school, and this could easily contribute to his lack of interest in the novel. Additionally, on the basis of Jaime’s and Fabiola’s ninth-grade standardized test scores, reading Nectar in a Sieve is likely challenging for both students, but Jaime’s particular situation may make him less likely to persevere.

# Summary: fluidity and variance in L1/L2 writing expertise

Peer interactions during in-class writing consistently reveal both the limitations of ascribing static expert and novice labels and the potential for students to use their first language proficiencies as affordances for each other. The fluidity of students’ footing in L1 writing conversations makes possible a range of seldom considered affordances for English learners and highlights the fact that these students do, in fact, already possess many different kinds of knowledge about writing. As the preceding examples indicate, focal students’ demonstrated expertise varies substantially (see Table 1). These differences stem from a combination of individual and environmental factors (van Lier, 2000), from language proficiency to background knowledge to literacy skills to academic engagement and motivation.7

# Conclusions

Students’ use of the L1 to broker conversations and assert expert and novice identities demonstrates that language use during writing activities reflects both cognitive and social phenomena. Students draw upon their first language to cognitively manage tasks and assert expertise as well as to position themselves in relation to their peers and teacher as experts or novices in certain aspects of writing. These students, often viewed from a deficit perspective by schools, teachers, and even peers, are able to assume expert roles in relation to English literacy tasks, and L1 use offers an opportunity for their academic, linguistic, and literacy-related knowledge to be recognized and validated. Students’ first language use redefines in-school writing traditions that would normally position them simply as unskilled, novice L2 writers. As noted previously, these students’ knowledge is not always complete, but their existing expertise represents a valuable resource in this content-area classroom, one that can be built upon and expanded through thoughtful literacy instruction.

From a methodological perspective, this study demonstrates that analyzing the interactional histories of any given piece of writing offers a promising means of investigating writing processes. I argue that such a focus – which should include analysis of written, spoken, and nonverbal interactions between writers and their environments – can tell researchers much more about language proficiency and pedagogy than any finished piece of writing ever could. An interactional histories analysis can be considered a type of microgenetic approach (Wertsch & Stone, 1978) to language and literacy research, which focuses on the process of a learner’s development rather than only the result of that development. Wertsch (1985), who traces a concern with microgenesis to Vygotsky’s work, explains that, ‘‘by analyzing the processes of skill formation [researchers in this tradition] argue that we can understand the structure of the final product. Thus, when the microgenesis of a skill varies in certain ways, we can expect the makeup of the endproduct to vary also’’ (p. 55).

This perspective, however, is more than merely a methodological stance because interactions also tell us who individual writers are. The ways in which they use resources available to them (other people, texts, or other tools) are intimately tied to their personalities, previous experiences, linguistic proficiencies, and motivations for writing. Available interactional resources are not necessarily affordances, however, and any given resource – from language brokering to informal teacher conferences to first language use – varies in the extent to which it actually helps an individual student understand content, develop writing abilities, or acquire a second language. In this way, second language writers’ paths toward language and literacy development are necessarily unique.

We as researchers and practitioners should also embrace the multicompetence (Cook, 1999) of language minority students. As previous research has documented, the L1 is part of students’ writing processes both while composing individually (e.g., van Weijen, van den Berg, Rijlaarsdam, & Sanders, 2009) and while engaging in interactions with peers (e.g., DeGuerrero & Villamil, 2000). Bilingualism is a sociolinguistic reality for these students, one that is fundamental to their connections with peers, family, and the community. Theories of language pedagogy should acknowledge the significance of the first language not only in linguistic terms of ‘‘interference’’ or ‘‘transfer’’ but also in terms of students’ multilingual social identities (Belz, 2003), which often powerfully influence the ways in which they interact in the classroom. For the L2 users at South Sierra, the opportunity to use their first language provided an important opportunity to draw upon a range of existing linguistic resources to accomplish the writing task with which they were presented.

Focal students also demonstrate an extensive willingness to share what they know with peers, employing their expertise in informal interactions without their teacher explicitly directing them to do so. Building upon this proclivity, teachers could provide students with additional training in how to act as effective peer writing tutors for each other (Berg, 1999; Stanley, 1992). While peer support cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for teacher-directed instruction and feedback related to writing, such training could help make more productive a phenomenon that is already occurring in the classroom. Furthermore, the use of L1 in these peer groupings should be seen as a cognitive affordance and important social tool (Brooks and Donato, 1994) rather than only a ‘‘crutch’’ for students at lower proficiencies. This perspective necessarily recognizes a role for first language use in the second language classroom because as Anton and DeCamilla (1998) caution, prohibiting L1 use can both thwart cognitive activity and prevent effective collaboration among peers.

As Turnbull and Dailey-O’Cain (2009a) argue, using the L1 in classrooms should not replace or challenge the importance of second language acquisition. Rather, it must be understood as an affordance that can facilitate L2 learning and assist students in meeting the demands of content-area tasks, and it is possible for peers to offer strategic guidance for each other during classroom writing activities. At the same time, however, teachers must be realistic about the limits of students’ writing expertise in both their first and second languages. When assessments and observations indicate that students are in fact lacking the rhetorical, linguistic, or academic information they need to complete a content-area writing task, building new knowledge requires that teachers (1) provide students with multiple, meaningful opportunities to engage with the academic content and analyze existing models of successful writing and (2) teach students how to recognize the key features of these texts.

In relation to language more generally, teachers and schools should consider the cognitive and linguistic benefits of creating programs that rigorously develop students’ language proficiencies in both of the languages they speak, especially when a significant portion of the population shares the same home language, as it does at South Sierra. Such work is not without precedent; Martinez, Orellana, Pacheco, & Carbone (2008) have developed a curriculum that builds upon bilingual students’ language brokering experiences to develop voice in their academic writing, and Orellana and Reynolds (2008) have explored the links between students’ language brokering practices and schoolbased paraphrasing or summarizing skills. Even when teachers do not share their students’ first languages, efforts can be made to develop students’ bilingual repertoires. Teachers participating in the collaborative project documented in Schecter and Cummins (2003), for example, created developmentally appropriate experiences with language and literacy for their students, who spoke more than forty languages. These efforts, including the creation of dual-language books, used students’ and their families’ multilingualism as a resource to encourage both first and second language development. While this initiative took place with younger learners, similar strategies could be developed for use with secondary students as well.

This study highlights several productive directions for further research into the use of the L1 among peers in L2 settings. Such work could, for example, document students’ longitudinal L2 writing development in settings that either encourage or proscribe L1 use, thereby documenting the ways in which the L1 is used as proficiency develops as well as the long-term impact of L1 use on students’ writing and overall language proficiency. Psycholinguistic second language writing research has begun to explore the ways in which L2 proficiency affects the use of the first language while thinking aloud on individual writing tasks (Wang, 2003; Wang & Wen, 2002; Woodall, 2002). Taking such studies as a starting point, longitudinal research that focuses on adolescent language minority students, includes first language use among peers, and uses a sociocultural framework could provide useful insight into these issues. Additionally, video-recorded interactions, which were not logistically possible in the South Sierra setting, could explore the potentially significant role that various nonverbal aspects of communication may have on first and second language use during writing activities. Research could also address how the development of linguistic and rhetorical knowledge in language-minority students’ first languages impacts their writing – and their peer discussions about writing – in their second languages. It is hoped that this study offers confirming evidence of the presence and usefulness of the L1 in second language writing settings, as well as the need to better understand this phenomenon and the pedagogical and linguistic conditions under which it can be most effective.

# General notes on transcription:

1. Transcriptions are written in standard orthography. Orthographical approximation, also know as ‘‘eye dialect,’’ is used to capture non-conventional language. Although some researchers oppose the use of eye dialect (Gumperz & Berenz, 1993), I have chosen to use it rather than to provide phonetic or standardized glosses for the following reasons: (1) students’ non-conventional speech reflects important elements of their language proficiencies and speech communities and (2) it improves readability, especially in the speech of English learners who may use many non-conventional forms.   
2. Non-conventional features will not be marked or otherwise notated [i.e., ‘‘sic’’] unless disfluencies obscure meaning. In this case, a footnote will be added.   
3. In order to increase readability, transcripts are 1.5-spaced, although non-English utterances and the translations directly below them are single-spaced.   
4. Double columned transcripts are used when the verbal utterances are not sufficient to make the interaction clear. In these cases, participants’ utterances will be found in the left-hand column, and the right-hand column will: (1) describe nonverbal actions, (2) describe who is being addressed in a given utterance, and (3) clarify the meaning of ambiguous utterances.
