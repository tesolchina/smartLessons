Chapter One

# Introduction

ChatGPT leapt onto the scene in November 2022. It is already disrupting businesses and industries like higher education, similar to the printing press and the internet. At its core, chatGPT uses artificial intelligence to compose responses to queries spanning numerous topics.

Naturally, in education, the camps are divided between those who want to ban chatGPT because they see it as a way for students to cheat. In contrast, others see it as a tool to extend learning. As an instructional technologist, I see great potential in chatGPT. I have already started using it to support the faculty I work with.

This book provides examples of using chatGPT to enhance the classroom experience in teaching and learning. I have shared different ways that you can use chatGPT in your classroom. For each idea, I have provided an example. The example has two parts:

The prompt provided to chatGPT. These are in bold.   
The response from chatGPT. These are in italics.

It is also important to note that I do not always agree with the results that chatGPT provided. Nevertheless, I want to show you what is possible. I am excited about what I have discovered as I work through each example. The possibilities are endless. I hope you are as enthusiastic as I am.

What is chatGPT?

When asked, chatGPT explained that it is a pre-trained language model created by OpenAI. It is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) model and is trained on a large dataset of conversational text. It can be fine-tuned for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as language translation, question answering, and text completion. It can also be used to generate human-like text for tasks such as chatbot development and language generation.

ChatGPT is another addition to a line of artificial intelligence writing tools such as Jasper, Sudowrite, Quillbot, etc. It builds on Grammarly, the Hemingway app, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and others. Historically, education has pushed back on new technologies entering the field, such as writing, printing press, slide rulers, calculators, computers, word processors, spell checkers, grammar checkers, the internet, Wikipedia, open educational resources, etc.

Developers trained ChatGPT on a conversational text dataset, including an extensive collection of dialogue from various sources such as books, movies, and websites. OpenAI has not publicly disclosed the specific dataset used to train the model. The training dataset is vast, with over a billion words, used to train the model to learn the nuances of conversational language and generate human-like responses.

OpenAI has not publicly disclosed the specific data used to train ChatGPT. However, they prepared the model with a diverse dataset that includes a wide range of factual information such as historical events, science, technology, and general knowledge. The training data came from various sources such as books, articles, and websites that provide accurate and reliable information.

Additionally, the model could have been fine-tuned on specific factual datasets to improve its performance on certain tasks, although this information is not publicly available.

How to Use chatGPT

ChatGPT is a web-based tool. You can find it at https://chat.openai.com/. You must create an account to begin using chatGPT. Once you have created an account, you type in a query or action into the chat field provided. ChatGPT typically responds within 30 seconds.

ChatGPT cannot review external pages; however, you can copy and paste the content into chatGPT. When doing so, enclose the content within quotes. ChatGPT has a query size limit and will warn you if you exceed it. Here are examples of possible prompts:

Summarize this article “<article>”   
Outline this article “<article>”   
Develop multiple choice questions from this article “<article>”

Keys to using ChatGPT

Here are some things I have learned during my short time using chatGPT.

Be Specific When Making a Request. Be as specific as you can when crafting your prompt for chatGPT.1 Suppose you want to get a list of learning objectives for a course you plan to teach. You could begin by asking chatGPT:

# Write learning objectives for a change management course.

ChatGPT returned the following:

1. Understand the principles and processes of change management and their application in various organizational contexts.

2. Develop the ability to assess the impact of change on individuals, teams, and organizations, and develop strategies to minimize resistance and maximize adoption.   
3. Learn the skills to plan, execute, and evaluate change management initiatives, including communication, stakeholder management, and project management.

Perhaps you need them in the format of “Students will…” You could craft a prompt including that phrase. Such as

Write learning objectives for a change management course in the format of “Students will…”

This results in the following from chatGPT.

1. Students will understand the principles and processes of change management and their application in various organizational contexts.   
2. Students will develop the ability to assess the impact of change on individuals, teams, and organizations, and develop strategies to minimize resistance and maximize adoption.   
3. Students will learn the skills to plan, execute, and evaluate change management initiatives, including communication, stakeholder management, and project management.

You can write a more exact prompt by adding the phrasing “so that.” Here is an example with the results.

# Write learning objectives for a change management course in the format of “Students will…” and “so that “

1. Students will understand the principles and processes of change management and their application in various organizational contexts so that they can effectively plan and implement changes in their organization.

2. Students will develop the ability to assess the impact of change on individuals, teams, and organizations, and develop strategies to minimize resistance and maximize adoption so that they can effectively manage the human side of change.

3. Students will learn the skills to plan, execute, and evaluate change management initiatives, including communication, stakeholder management, and project management so that they can effectively lead and manage change projects.

As you can see, each addition makes the prompt more specific.

Use an Iterative Approach. Use a phased approach for creating your prompts.2 For example, you could ask chatGPT to offer learning goals for your class. Next, run each learning goal through chatGPT and ask for learning objectives. Finally, ask for each learning objective’s course content, lesson plan, and quiz questions.

Ask chatGPT to improve its work. You do not have to settle for what chatGPT provides you.3 Ask chatGPT to improve on the product it proposes to you.

Act as Something. You can have chatGPT transform its responses to reflect those of professionals in the field using GitHub’s Awesome ChatGPT Prompts.4 Each prompt provides detailed instructions you can provide to chatGPT before starting your session. Here are some of the possibilities:

Act as a Linux Terminal Act as <position> Interviewer

Act as a Travel Guide   
Act as a Plagiarism Checker   
Act as ‘Character’ from ‘Movie/Book/Anything   
Act as a Football Commentator

There are many more. Here is an example from GitHub for the “Act as a Debater” prompt that $@$ devisasari contributed.

I want you to act as a debater. I will provide you with some topics related to current events, and your task is to research both sides of the debates, present valid arguments for each side, refute opposing points of view, and draw persuasive conclusions based on evidence. Your goal is to help people come away from the discussion with increased knowledge and insight into the topic. My first request is, “I want an opinion piece about Deno.”

Always Validate. You must always review your work and not take it at face value. While chatGPT is quite good, it is not perfect. ChatGPT users must apply critical-thinking skills to ensure that results are correct. You are still the expert who oversees the assistance that chatGPT provides.

Chapter Two

# Using chatGPT to Prepare for Classes

Welcome to this chapter on using ChatGPT to assist in building a new course. With the help of ChatGPT, you can save valuable time and streamline the course preparation process. From creating a course description to developing classroom activities, ChatGPT can help you with every step. In this chapter, we will explore how ChatGPT can assist you in writing learning goals and objectives, creating a lesson plan, identifying community-building activities, and generating project ideas. Additionally, we will discuss how ChatGPT can help with crafting lecture notes, creating rubrics, developing discussion questions, and testing assignment prompts. So let’s dive in and see how ChatGPT can help make your course preparation a breeze.

# 1. Create a Course Description

There is nothing worse than looking at a blank sheet of paper. You have an idea for a new course, and now you need to share that idea with others. Course description let others know what your class is about. ChatGPT will craft a course description for you if you feed it a little bit about your course. Here is an example:

# Write a college course description for an introduction to artificial intelligence course.

ChatGPT: This course provides an introduction to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Topics covered include the history and current state of $A I _ { \mathrm { { ; } } }$ , problem solving and search, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, and natural language processing. Students will learn about the fundamental concepts and techniques used in AI, as well as the potential applications and ethical considerations of the field. The course will include both lectures and hands-on programming assignments, giving students the opportunity to gain practical experience with AI techniques and tools. Prerequisites: programming experience in a high-level language such as Python or Java is recommended.

# 2. Create Learning Goals and Objectives

ChatGPT can help you jumpstart your course development. Designing a new course from scratch can be challenging. There is a lot that you must pull together. You must develop course goals, objectives, assessments, activities, and content.

You can guide chatGPT to create valuable results when developing goals and objectives by including references to Bloom’s Taxonomy in your prompt. Here are some examples that you can tailor to your needs. The more detail you provide, the more specific the results will be.

Write learning objectives for a <course subject> course at the remembering level of Bloom’s Taxonomy using verbs like Cite, Define, Describe, Draw, Enumerate, Identify, Index, Indicate, Label, List, Match, Meet, Name, Outline, Point, Quote, Read, Recall, Recite,

I generated examples for each level of Bloom’s Taxonomy for a sports management course. ChatGPT provided ten results per prompt, and I cut it down to five each for this example.   
If you are not satisfied with what chatGPT returns, you can ask the program to rerun the prompt. Here are examples for each level of Bloom’s Taxonomy: Write learning objectives for a sports management course at the remembering level of Bloom’s Taxonomy using verbs like Cite, Define, Describe, Draw, Enumerate, Identify, Index, Indicate, Label, List,

You can improve your learning objectives with some minor modifications:5   
Include a “so that you can” addition to help increase motivation and explain why the objective is essential.   
Make the objectives measurable.   
Include an assessment rubric for each objective.

3. Write a Lesson Plan

Once you have learning objectives, begin developing other essential tools for your class, such as lesson plans. Again, ChatGPT can help you get started. Identify the lesson plan format and the parts you will include. Naturally, the more specific you are, the closer the results will be to meeting your needs. In this example, I will use a learning objective as part of my prompt for generating a lesson plan.

Create a lesson plan for college undergraduate students on the learning objective “Students will be able to name the main stakeholders in the sports industry and understand their specific roles.”

ChatGPT: Lesson Title: Identifying Key Stakeholders in the Sports Industry Learning Objectives:

Students will be able to name the main stakeholders in the sports industry   
Students will understand the specific roles of each stakeholder in the sports industry

Materials Needed:

Whiteboard or blackboard   
Markers or chalk   
Handout of key stakeholders in the sports industry (attached)   
Case study of a specific sports organization (attached)

# Introduction (10 minutes):

Begin the class by asking students if they are aware of who the key stakeholders are in the sports industry.   
Write their responses on the board or blackboard, and then use these responses to introduce the topic of the lesson.   
Explain that the objective of the lesson is to understand the specific roles of the main stakeholders in the sports industry.

Direct Instruction (20 minutes):

Distribute the handout of key stakeholders in the sports industry to students.   
Review the handout with the class and discuss the specific roles of each stakeholder in the sports industry.   
Use the whiteboard or blackboard to create a visual representation of the relationships between the stakeholders, and explain how they interact with each other.   
Use the case study to provide an example of how the stakeholders interact in a real-world scenario.

Guided Practice (20 minutes):

Divide the class into small groups of 3-4 students.

Assign each group a different sports organization and ask them to research the stakeholders involved in that organization. Have each group present their findings to the class and discuss the specific roles of each stakeholder in that organization.

Independent Practice (20 minutes):

Have each student select a current event or news story related to the sports industry and research the stakeholders involved.   
Have students write a short report on their findings and present it to the class.   
Closure (10 minutes):   
Review the main points of the lesson and the specific roles of each stakeholder in the sports industry.   
Ask students to reflect on what they have learned and how it will help them understand the sports industry better. Remind students that understanding the stakeholders in the sports industry is important to understanding how the industry works and how decisions are made.

Assessment:

Student participation in class discussions and group presentations Student reports on current events or news stories in the sports industry A quiz or test on the specific roles of the main stakeholders in the sports industry.

Note: The attached handout and case study are examples, It’s better to use suitable material to your subject, depending on the resources you have available and the specific needs of your students.

# 4. Craft Classroom Activities

Are you stuck on developing a classroom activity? ChatGPT can help. Craft a prompt with your idea and let chatGPT work on it. If you have no ideas, ask chatGPT to provide some activity ideas. Once you see one you like, submit another prompt for chatGPT to flesh it out.

Write a classroom activity that would help students better understand the challenges for drafting The Constitution.

ChatGPT: One classroom activity that could help students better understand the challenges faced during the drafting of the Constitution is a simulated Constitutional Convention. This activity would involve dividing the class into small groups, with each group representing a different state or interest group. The groups would then work together to draft a new Constitution, while grappling with the same challenges and conflicts that the framers of the actual Constitution faced.

Here’s a possible structure for the activity:

1. Begin by providing students with background information on the drafting of the Constitution and the main issues that were debated.   
2. Divide the class into small groups, and assign each group to represent a different state or interest group. For example, one group may represent the small states, another the large states, and another the Northern states.   
3. Provide each group with a set of objectives and interests that their state or interest group would have wanted to achieve during the drafting of the Constitution.

4. Each group will have to work together to draft a new Constitution that addresses these objectives while also addressing the needs of other states or interest groups.

5. The groups will present their proposed Constitution to the class, and the class as a whole will deliberate and vote on the proposed Constitution.

6. After the class votes, have a discussion about the challenges that each group faced during the drafting process and what trade-offs they had to make. This would help students to understand the difficulties of balancing different interests and competing demands in drafting a document like the Constitution.

7. Finally, have students compare their simulated Constitution with the actual Constitution and discuss how the simulation helped them understand the challenges that the framers of the Constitution faced.

This activity will give students the opportunity to be immersed in the same kind of debates that the framers of the Constitution had to deal with, which will help them to better understand the challenges that were faced during the drafting process.

# 5. Develop a List of Ice Breaker Questions and Activities

One of the recommended community-building activities for starting an academic term is to conduct an icebreaker. Icebreakers provide a fun and relaxing way to facilitate class introductions and learn more about the participants. You can ask chatGPT for some ideas and activity instructions. What are some icebreaker questions one could use for a college-level course?

# ChatGPT:

1. What are you most looking forward to in this class?   
2. What are your interests outside of school?   
3. What is your favorite book or movie?   
4. What are your career goals?   
5. Have you traveled anywhere interesting recently?   
6. What is your favorite subject and why?   
7. What do you do to relax and unwind?   
8. What is something you’re currently learning or interested in learning?   
9. How do you prefer to study or take notes?   
10. Are you from this area or did you move here for school?

# What are some icebreaker activities one could use for a college-level course?

ChatGPT:

1. Two Truths and a Lie: Have each student introduce themselves by sharing three statements about themselves, with two being true and one being a lie. The class can then try to guess which statement is the lie.   
2. Speed Friending: Set up a rotation where students spend a few minutes talking to each other one-on-one before moving on to the next person.   
3. Group Puzzle: Divide the class into small groups and give each group a puzzle or problem to solve together. This can be a great way to encourage teamwork and communication.   
4. Human Scavenger Hunt: Create a list of questions or tasks related to

the class or the students’ interests and have them find people in the

class who fit the criteria.   
5. Word Association: Have each student share a word that is related to the class or a topic that will be discussed, and have the class build on each other’s words to create a chain of associations.   
6. What’s In Your Bag: Have each student bring a bag or backpack to class and have them take turns showing the class what they have in it and why it is important to them.   
7. Debate: Divide the class into two groups, one for and one against a chosen topic, and have them debate on it.   
8. “Two Truths and a Dream”: Have each student share two truths about themselves and a dream or something they wish to achieve in the future.   
9. “Mingle-Mingle”: Have students move around the room and talk to each other, asking open-ended questions to get to know each other better.   
10. “Get to know your neighbor”: Have students do a quick activity with their neighbor or nearby classmates, such as creating a list of things they have in common or drawing a portrait of each other.

# 6. Identify Community-Building Activities

ChatGPT can be an excellent source for identifying community-building activities for your class. Once you get a list of topics, you can ask for more details or instructions for a specific activity.

# What are community-building activities for a college-level class?

# ChatGPT:

1. Team-building exercises: These can include activities such as trustbuilding exercises, problem-solving challenges, and communication exercises.   
2. Group projects: Assign group projects that require students to work together to achieve a common goal. This can help to build trust and cooperation among classmates.   
3. Class discussions: Encourage open and honest dialogue among classmates by facilitating class discussions on relevant topics.   
4. Study groups: Encourage students to form study groups outside of class to work on assignments and prepare for exams.   
5. Social events: Organize social events such as movie nights, game nights, or potlucks to help students connect with one another outside of class.   
6. Service learning: Organize volunteer opportunities for the class to participate in together, such as community service projects or fundraising events.   
7. Class trips: Organize trips or field trips related to the class material to give students a chance to bond and learn together in a different setting.   
8. Sharing sessions: Encourage students to share their personal experiences, perspectives, and insights. This can help to create a more inclusive and understanding community.   
9. Debate or public speaking: Encourage students to take part in debates or public speaking opportunities, this can help to build self-confidence and improve communication skills.   
10. Online discussions or chats: Utilize online platforms such as discussion boards or group chats to keep the class engaged and connected even outside of class time.

If these are too vague, you could drill down for more specifics. For example, I am interested in learning more about Team-building exercises.

# Can you provide examples of team-building exercises?

ChatGPT: Sure, here are a few examples of team-building exercises that can be used in a college-level class:

1. The Marshmallow Challenge: In this exercise, teams are given a set of materials (such as marshmallows, spaghetti noodles, and tape) and a task to build the tallest freestanding structure in a given time period. This exercise promotes creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork.   
2. Escape Room: Create an “Escape Room” scenario where students have to solve puzzles and clues to escape from a locked room. This exercise promotes communication, problem-solving, and teamwork.   
3. Human Knot: Have the class stand in a circle, facing the center. Then have each student reach out and grab the hand of someone across from them. The goal is to untangle the knot without letting go of each other’s hands. This exercise promotes communication, problem-solving, and

teamwork.

4. Blindfolded Trust Walk: Have the class form pairs, with one person blindfolded and the other as a guide. The guide must lead the blindfolded person through an obstacle course while communicating effectively to complete the course successfully.

5. The Rope and Bucket Challenge: Divide the class into teams and give each team a long rope and a bucket. The goal is to use the rope to transport the bucket from one end of a designated area to the other, without carrying the bucket or letting it touch the ground. This exercise promotes teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

6. Scavenger hunt: Create a scavenger hunt that involves the whole class and where they have to work in teams to find different items or complete different tasks.

7. Two Truths and a Lie: Have each student introduce themselves by sharing three statements about themselves, with two being true and one being a lie. The class can then try to guess which statement is the lie.

8. The Tower of Tissues: Divide the class into teams, give each team a box of tissues and a task to build the tallest structure in a given time period. This exercise promotes creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork.

9. The Egg Drop Challenge: Divide the class into teams and give each team a raw egg and a limited amount of materials (such as straws, paper, and tape) to create a protective structure for the egg. The goal is to drop the egg from a height without breaking it. This exercise promotes creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork.

10. The Lego Challenge: Divide the class into teams and give each team a set of Legos and a task to build something specific or creative within a given time period. This exercise promotes creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork.

I can prompt chatGPT for instructions if I find something I like.

# Provide instructions for The Rope and Bucket Challenge.

ChatGPT: The Rope and Bucket Challenge is a team-building exercise that promotes teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Here are the instructions for conducting the challenge:

1. Divide the class into teams of 4-6 people. Each team should have an equal number of participants.   
2. Provide each team with a long rope (about 20-30 feet in length) and a bucket.   
3. Designate a starting point and a finish line for the challenge. The finish line should be at least 20-30 feet away from the starting point.   
4. Explain the rules of the challenge: The goal is to transport the bucket from the starting point to the finish line using only the rope. The bucket cannot be carried or touched by any team member, and it must not touch the ground.   
5. Allow the teams to strategize and plan how they will complete the challenge. Give them a few minutes to practice before starting the challenge.   
6. Time the teams as they complete the challenge and record their results.   
7. After all teams have completed the challenge, debrief and discuss the different strategies used by each team and how they worked or didn’t

work. Ask for feedback and suggestions for improvement.

8. As an alternative or an addition, you can add a twist to the challenge, for example, adding an obstacle in the middle of the course that teams have to navigate around or adding a time constraint to complete the task.

9. Make sure to remind the teams of the importance of good communication and teamwork throughout the task, and encourage them to support each other and work together towards a common goal.

0. Have fun, and enjoy the challenge!

# 7. Create examples

Often students are looking for examples to justify why they would need to learn something. You can ask chatGPT to provide some examples. For instance, I prompted chatGPT to share different ways to determine the height of a skyscraper. It came back with five results, and I pressed it for more. ChatGPT quickly provided five more options. Here is my interaction with chatGPT:

What are different ways you can determine the height of a skyscraper?

ChatGPT: There are several ways to determine the height of a skyscraper, including:

1. Measuring with a tape measure or ruler: This method involves physically measuring the height of the building using a tape measure or ruler. This method is only feasible for smaller buildings, as it becomes impractical for taller structures.   
2. Using a surveyor’s level: A surveyor’s level is a type of instrument that is used to measure the height of a building by measuring the angle of

elevation from the base of the building to the top. This method is more accurate than measuring with a tape measure or ruler, but it is still only feasible for smaller buildings.

3. Using a laser rangefinder: A laser rangefinder is a device that uses a laser beam to determine the distance to a target. By measuring the distance from the base of the building to the top, the height of the building can be calculated.

4. Using satellite imagery: Modern technology allows to use satellite imagery to determine the height of a skyscraper. This can be done by comparing the building’s shadow to its known dimensions, or by using stereo imagery to create a 3D model of the building and measuring its height from there.

5. Using Triangulation: Triangulation is a method that uses trigonometry to determine the height of a building by measuring the angles of elevation from two or more different points. This method requires a clear line of sight and is more

# What are other suggestions?

ChatGPT: Here are a few additional suggestions for determining the height of a skyscraper:

1. Using a barometer: A barometer is an instrument that measures the atmospheric pressure. By measuring the pressure at the base and the top of the building, the height of the building can be calculated.   
2. Using a drone: A drone equipped with GPS and a camera can be flown to the top of a building to measure its height. This method requires clear weather conditions, and the drone must be flown to the very top

of the skyscraper including the antenna or spire.

3. Using a theodolite: A theodolite is a type of instrument that can be used to measure the horizontal and vertical angles of a building. By measuring the angles and using trigonometry, the height of the building can be calculated.

4. Using a clinometer: A clinometer is an instrument that can be used to measure the angle of elevation of a building. By measuring the angle of elevation from the base of the building to the top, the height of the building can be calculated.

5. Using an altimeter: Altimeter is a device that measures the altitude of an object above a fixed level, mostly used for aircrafts and alpinism, it can also be used to measure the height of a skyscraper by measuring the height above sea level.

I also asked it to “Provide examples of how Ohm’s Law can be used.” It readily shared examples.

# 8. Ideas for Starting Your Class

Are you looking for an exciting way to start a class and are stuck for ideas? Once again, chatGPT can help you out. I have many books on my shelves with many ideas to initiate a course, but I often lack time to sift through them. ChatGPT can rapidly provide me with a list of great ideas to use. Check out this example:

# What are some interesting or novel ways to begin a class?

ChatGPT:

1. Brainstorming: Start the class by asking an open-ended question or problem related to the material that will be covered, and have the students brainstorm and share their ideas. This can help to engage students and get them thinking critically.

2. Current events: Begin the class by discussing a current event or news article related to the class material. This can help to make the class more relevant and engaging.   
3. Icebreakers: Start the class with a fun icebreaker activity to help students get to know each other and create a more relaxed and comfortable classroom environment.   
4. Quotes: Begin the class by sharing a quote related to the class material, and have the students discuss its relevance and meaning.   
5. Reflection: Begin the class by having students reflect on their learning from the previous class or on a specific topic related to the class. This can help to activate prior knowledge and build on it.   
6. Mind map: Start the class by creating a mind map of the main concepts or topics that will be covered. This can help to give students an overview of the material and make connections between different ideas.   
7. Interactive Lectures: Start the class with a interactive lecture, by using polls, quizzes, or other interactive tools to engage the students and make the class more interactive.   
8. Debate or discussion: Begin the class with a debate or a discussion on a controversial topic or a problem related to the class material. This can help to promote critical thinking and active participation.   
9. Case Study: Begin the class by discussing a real-life case or example related to the class material. This can help to make the class more relatable and engaging.

0. Games: Start the class with a game related to the class material, this can help to make the class more fun and interactive, and help students to remember the material better.

You could then follow up with chatGPT for more specifics. Ask how and why to do something.

# 9. Craft Lecture Notes

Lecture notes are another helpful tool that takes time to develop. Jumpstart your lecture note creation by feeding chatGPT some ideas.6 ChatGPT will, in turn, draft a set of lecture notes that you can modify. Here is an example of a lecture on artificial intelligence:

Write lecture notes on the history of artificial intelligence.

ChatGPT: Lecture Notes: History of Artificial Intelligence   
I. Introduction   
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of how to create intelligent machines   
The field of AI has a long history, dating back to ancient times

II. Ancient History

The idea of creating intelligent machines can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Greek god Hephaestus, who was said to have created robots to assist him in his workshop   
The ancient Chinese also had legends of mechanical automatons, such as the “Thousand-Armed Guanyin” and the “Jade Emperor’s Mechanical Boy”

III. Modern History

The modern field of AI began in the 1950s, with the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the birth of AI as a scientific field At the conference, a group of researchers led by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon proposed the study of “how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves”

IV. Early AI Research

Early AI research focused on creating “thinking machines” that could mimic human intelligence   
This included work on rule-based systems, knowledge representation, and natural language processing   
Early AI systems were limited by the technology of the time, and progress was slow

V. AI Winter

In the 1970s and 1980s, AI research experienced a period of decline, known as the “AI Winter”

Funding and interest in AI decreased, as early AI systems failed to live up to expectations

Many researchers left the field, and progress slowed

VI. Recent History

In the 1990s and 2000s, AI experienced a resurgence, driven by advances in computing power, data storage, and the availability of large amounts of data

Machine learning, a subfield of AI, became increasingly popular, and many real-world applications of AI were developed Today, AI is a rapidly growing field, with applications in many areas such as self-driving cars, virtual assistants, and medical diagnosis

# VII. Conclusion

The history of AI is long and varied, and the field has gone through periods of both progress and decline   
Today, AI is a rapidly growing field, with many exciting developments and potential applications.

# 10. Whiteboard Layout

Every aspect of your instruction should be intentional. This intentionality includes your use of a whiteboard or blackboard. ChatGPT can suggest what to have on your whiteboard and where to put it.7

Explain what should be written on the whiteboard to illustrate the history of artificial intelligence.

ChatGPT: To illustrate the history of artificial intelligence on a whiteboard, a timeline could be created. Here is an example:

1950s: Dartmouth Conference – birth of AI as a scientific field 1960s-1970s: Early AI research focusing on rule-based systems, knowledge representation, and natural language processing 1970s-1980s: AI Winter – decline in funding and interest in AI 1990s-2000s: Resurgence of AI with advances in computing power and data storage, emergence of machine learning Recent: AI becomes a rapidly growing field with many real-world

# applications

Additionally, one could add a few key figures or milestones of the AI history, like the names of the researchers that proposed AI as a field of study in the Dartmouth Conference, or the emergence of AI based startups and companies.

# 11. Create Rubrics

Rubrics are powerful tools to help students prepare assignments. Instructors can use rubrics to assess submitted projects. However, rubrics take time to create. ChatGPT can aid in the development of course activity rubrics. As chatGPT notes in the example below, you can include specific requirements as part of the prompt.

# Create a rubric to assess a classroom presentation

# ChatGPT:

1. Content: Does the presentation cover all the required information and is it accurate and up-to-date? (0-3 points)   
2. Organization: Is the presentation well-structured and easy to follow? (0-3 points)   
3. Visual aids: Are the visual aids clear, relevant and effectively used to support the presentation? (0-2 points)   
4. Delivery: Is the presentation delivered in a clear and confident manner? Is the pace appropriate? (0-2 points)   
5. Audience engagement: Does the presentation involve the audience and encourage participation? (0-2 points)   
6. Time management: Does the presentation finish within the allocated

time frame? (0-1 points)

7. Creativity: Does the presentation show originality and innovation? (0- 2 points)

Total possible points: 15

Note: The above-mentioned points are general one, it would be better if you can customize the rubric based on the specific requirement of your course.

# 12. Generate Project Ideas

One of the common requests you will get from students is for you to provide ideas for a project you assign. You will have generated a list of ideas after teaching a particular class over and over. However, these ideas can become stale over time. ChatGPT can help you brainstorm new ideas.8

# What are student project ideas for demonstrating knowledge of artificial intelligence?

ChatGPT: Here are a few student project ideas for demonstrating knowledge of artificial intelligence:

1. Image classification: Train a deep learning model to classify images from a dataset such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. The model could be a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a more advanced architecture such as ResNet or DenseNet.   
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Train a model for text classification, sentiment analysis, or language translation. This could involve using pre-trained models such as BERT or GPT-2 and finetuning them on a specific task or dataset.   
3. Generative models: Train a generative model such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate images, text, or audio.   
4. Reinforcement Learning (RL): Apply RL algorithms such as Q-learning or SARSA to train an agent to play a game or control a robot. This could involve creating a custom environment or using an existing one like OpenAI’s Gym.

5. Anomaly detection: Build an unsupervised learning model to detect anomalies or outliers in a dataset. This could involve using techniques

like clustering, density-based methods, or autoencoders.   
6. Chatbot: Build a chatbot using a pre-trained model such as GPT-3 or BERT and fine-tune it for a specific task or domain.   
7. Recommendation systems: Build a recommendation system using techniques such as matrix factorization or neural networks to recommend items to users based on their past behavior or preferences.   
8. Time series forecasting: Build a model to forecast time series data such as stock prices or weather data using techniques such as ARIMA or LSTM.

These are just a few ideas, and there are many more possibilities within the field of artificial intelligence. The key is to choose a project that aligns with your interests and skills, and that allows you to demonstrate a deep understanding of the concepts and techniques involved.

# 13. Generate Discussion Questions

One of the most powerful teaching tools in a classroom is discussion. You can use a discussion in a face-to-face class or an online class. The key to a great conversation is a well-drafted discussion question, which chatGPT can assist you in developing. You can create a list before a class or while in progress.9

Write 5 discussion prompts on the subject of artificial intelligence and its impact on higher education.

ChatGPT:

1. How will artificial intelligence change the way we teach and learn in higher education?

2. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI in the classroom?   
3. How can higher education institutions prepare for the integration of AI in their curriculums and classrooms?   
4. How will AI impact the job market for graduates of higher education institutions?   
5. How can we ensure that the integration of AI in higher education is accessible and equitable for all students?

# 14. Test your Assignment Prompts

Are you concerned that your students will use chatGPT to answer your homework assignments? If so, use chatGPT to test your assignment questions. Submit an assignment to chatGPT to see how quickly and easily it provides an answer. Also, observe the quality of the solution that comes back from chatGPT. Finally, modify your assignment and retest it until artificial intelligence is no longer an easy tool to complete it.10

Chapter Three

# Using chatGPT for Providing Instructional Assistance

ChatGPT can serve as your teaching assistant. As an instructor, providing detailed and personalized instruction to each student can be a timeconsuming task. ChatGPT can help alleviate this burden by providing quality feedback and instruction resources, allowing you to focus on adding your personal touch to the instruction. In this chapter, we will explore ways to employ ChatGPT as a teaching assistant, including essay grading, reading comprehension, creating Madlib stories, generating writing prompts, preparing writing samples, writing instructions for various tasks, creating personalized study plans, creating a presentation outline and generating dummy data. Let’s dive in and see how ChatGPT can help you save time and provide more personalized instruction to your students.

# 15. Essay Grading

Teachers can use chatGPT to grade written assignments automatically by training the model on a dataset of graded essays. However, with a generic prompt chatGPT can provide solid feedback to free up your time to focus on areas where you want to place specific guidance.

I asked chatGPT to provide grading feedback on a blog post, “Cataloging My Magic Collection With Evernote.” Here are the prompts and the results:

# Provide grading feedback on “<essay>”

ChatGPT: The post provides a detailed explanation of the author’s personal experiences with organizing their collection of magic resources using Evernote. The post also includes specific examples of how the author uses Evernote to catalog their collection and tips for other users. The post is wellwritten and easy to understand. However, the post could benefit from some editing to address some grammar and punctuation errors. Additionally, it could be more engaging if the author included more anecdotes or personal stories about their experiences with magic and how it has influenced their life. Overall, the post is informative and useful for others who are interested in organizing their collection of magic resources using Evernote.

# Do you have specifics?

ChatGPT: To provide specific feedback on the blog post, here are a few areas that could be improved:

The introduction could be clearer in explaining the purpose of the post and what the reader can expect to learn.   
The organization of the post could be improved by breaking it up into smaller sections and using headings to guide the reader through the content.   
The language used in the post could be more formal and less conversational to make it more appropriate for a blog post.   
The post could benefit from the inclusion of external sources and examples to support the information presented.

The post could be more engaging by including multimedia elements such as images or videos. The post could include a conclusion to summarize the main points and provide the readers with a call to action or next steps.

It’s important to note that these are suggestions and the post may still be useful and informative as it is. However, these changes could help make the post more polished and professional.

# 16. Reading Comprehension

Teachers can use chatGPT to generate multiple-choice questions or summaries of a text to help students understand and comprehend what they are reading.

You can summarize an article with the following prompt:

# Summarize this article “<article>”

I summarized the Bureaucracies section from Lumen Learning’s Intro to Sociology, Module 5: Society and Groups, Types of Formal Organizations. Here is the first result:

ChatGPT: The article discusses the concept of bureaucracies as a type of formal organization. According to sociologist Max Weber, bureaucracies have a hierarchy of authority, a clear division of labor, explicit rules, and an atmosphere of impersonality. The article discusses how these characteristics can be seen in institutions such as colleges and universities, and also in large businesses like Walmart. The article mentions that bureaucracies are often criticized for being slow, rule-bound, difficult to navigate and unfriendly. The article also points out that bureaucracies developed in the early 20th century and how it can be seen in different organizations today.

I then asked it to summarize it for a 5th grader with this prompt:

# Summarize this article at a 5th grade level “<article>”

ChatGPT: This article is talking about a thing called bureaucracies. A bureaucracy is a type of organization that has a boss in charge, different jobs for different people, a set of rules, and it is not very friendly. These types of organizations have been around for a long time and people often complain about them because they can be hard to understand and use. The article gives examples of bureaucracies in schools and in big stores like Walmart. It also explains that these organizations have rules to protect people and make sure things are fair. But sometimes, it can feel like the organization doesn’t care about the people using it.   
You can then generate questions with corresponding answers for the article. In this example, I provided the following prompt based on the summary: Generate questions about the article with corresponding answers at a college level.

ChatGPT:

What is a bureaucracy, according to the article? A bureaucracy is a type of formal organization that has a hierarchy of authority, a clear division of labor, explicit rules, and an atmosphere of impersonality.   
How does the article describe people’s perceptions of bureaucracies? The article states that people often complain about bureaucracies, declaring them slow, rule-bound, difficult to navigate, and unfriendly.   
What are some examples of bureaucracies provided in the article? The article provides examples of bureaucracies in institutions such as colleges and universities, as well as in large businesses like Walmart.   
How do colleges and universities try to reduce the impersonality that is   
common in formal organizations according to the article?   
The article states that many colleges and universities try to reduce the impersonality by prioritizing individual students and putting in place procedures to reduce it.   
What is the ideal-type of bureaucracy according to Weber?   
Weber’s ideal-type of bureaucracy is defined as having a hierarchy of authority, a clear division of labor, explicit rules, and an atmosphere of impersonality.

# 17. Create a Madlib Story

You can also use chatGPT to create Madlibs, which are fill-in-the-blank stories. The complete results are often quite funny. You can create a Madlib around a topic of your choice. Enjoy this example:

# Create a back-to-school Madlib story.

ChatGPT: It was the first day of (noun) and (name) was beyond excited. She had a brand new (noun) and a backpack full of (plural noun) and (plural noun). As she walked into her (noun) class, she couldn’t help but feel a little (adjective) about the upcoming school year.   
But her nerves quickly vanished when she saw her (noun) teacher, Mrs. (name). She had always been (adjective) and (name) knew she was in for a great (noun).

The first lesson of the day was (verb) and (name) was a natural. She (verb)ed her way through the (plural noun) and was even able to (verb) a (noun) with her (adjective) skills.

Next up was (noun) class with Mr. (name). He was known for being quite (adjective) and (name) was a bit (adjective) about the class. But she soon found that he was actually quite (adjective) and his (noun) lessons were (adjective) too.

After a long day of classes, (name) met up with her best (noun) and they walked to the (noun) together. They talked about their day and made plans for the (noun) (event) coming up.

(Name) couldn’t believe how (adjective) her first day of (noun) had been. She couldn’t wait to see what the rest of the (noun) had in store for her.11

# 18. Create a Topic Outline

Use chatGPT to draft an outline on virtually any topic. You can use an article or other block of text to serve as a part of the prompt. Students must think about their problem to get the best response from AI. One could enhance the chatGPT prompt by comparing and contrasting two articles or stories. In the classroom, you can have students create an outline and then use it to write an essay with or without their computers.12

# Can you create an outline on this article, “<article>”

ChatGPT:

I. Introduction A. Explanation of the plasma membrane B. Importance of the plasma membrane in cell biology II. Structure of the Plasma Membrane   
A. Description of the fluid mosaic model B. Explanation of the main components of the plasma membrane (phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates)   
III. Function of the Plasma Membrane   
A. Explanation of the main function of the plasma membrane (to enclose and separate the cell’s internal environment from its external environment) B. Role of phospholipids in maintaining the membrane’s fluidity   
C. Role of cholesterol in maintaining the membrane’s stability   
D. Role of proteins in providing structural support, acting as receptors, and transporting molecules across the membrane   
The result above is the beginning of the outline, but you get the idea.

# 19. Generate Writing Prompts

You can use chatGPT to generate creative writing prompts encouraging students to think outside the box and stretch their imaginations. Start a story where students add to it or generate creative prompts. ChatGPT never gets tired.

Here is an example of chatGPT-generated creative writing prompts.

# Please provide me with ten creative writing prompts.

# ChatGPT:

1. Write a story about a person who discovers they have the ability to time travel, but can only go back to one specific moment in their past.

9. Write a fiction piece about a person who can control the elements, and the consequences of their actions.   
10. Write a descriptive essay about a legendary hero you admire and why they inspire you.

# 20. Prepare Writing Samples

Enter a prompt or topic that is clear and specific to guide chatGPT in generating a writing sample relevant to the topic. After chatGPT has written the piece, you can review and edit it to suit your needs. The more specific you are, the more accurate chatGPT will respond. For example, include the specification in your prompt if you want a five-paragraph essay. For example, if you want to generate a sample of an academic paper on the topic of “The impact of AI in the healthcare industry,” you would give the following prompt to the model:

Write a research paper discussing the impact of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry, including its potential benefits and drawbacks, and how it is currently being used.

ChatGPT would then generate a coherent and well-written sample of an academic paper based on that prompt.

21. Write Instructions for Various Tasks

Sometimes you must draft a quick set of instructions to help a student. ChatGPT can help you with the first draft, thus freeing you to work on other things. Here is an example:

What are the steps for creating a video on a smartphone, uploading it to YouTube, and embedding it in a blog post.

ChatGPT: Here are the basic steps for creating a video on a smartphone, uploading it to YouTube, and embedding it in a blog post:

1. Open the camera app on your smartphone and record your video. Make sure the lighting and sound are good and the video is in focus.   
2. After recording, you can edit your video using a video editing app on your smartphone, if desired.   
3. Once you’re satisfied with your video, open the YouTube app on your smartphone and sign in to your account.   
4. Tap the upload button and select your video. Add a title, description, and any other relevant information to your video.   
5. Select the privacy settings for your video. Public means anyone can see it, Unlisted means that only people who have the link can view it, and private means only you and people you select can view it.

6. Once the video is uploaded, you can get the embed code by clicking the Share button and then the Embed button.

7. To embed the video in a blog post, you need to have a blog and a post. Once you have it, add the embed code to the HTML of your post where you want the video to appear.

8. Save the post and publish it.

You can also use a third party video hosting service like Vimeo, Wistia etc if you don’t want to use YouTube.

# 22. Personalized Study Plans

You can use ChatGPT to create personalized study plans with tailored recommendations for each student. Study plans can include recommending specific resources that align with a student’s learning abilities, such as texts or videos. Additionally, ChatGPT can help create a schedule or timeline of assignments and assessments tailored to each student’s needs and progress. For example, ChatGPT can suggest a more challenging reading or writing task for a student who is excelling in the class or provide extra support and guidance for a student who is struggling. Using ChatGPT to create personalized study plans, instructors can ensure that each student receives instruction tailored to their individual needs, allowing for more effective and efficient learning.

You could build a personalized study plan using mastery paths in a learning management system (LMS). ChatGPT can help you develop the content for the mastery path.

23. Create a Presentation Outline

ChatGPT can also save you time as you prepare a slide presentation for your class.13 You can ask chatGPT to provide an outline for your presentation that includes slide titles, image suggestions, and recommended bullet points. You can also indicate how many slides you need. In the example below, I asked for 20 slides. Note: I am only providing an example of five of those slides. Create an outline for a 20-slide slideshow on the history of artificial intelligence. Indicate the title, images, diagrams, and bullet points for each slide.

From checking essays for authenticity to critical analysis of AI-generated text, from debate assistance to writing interactive fiction, ChatGPT can enhance the learning experience for your students. We will explore how you can use ChatGPT in your discipline, including simulation-based learning, dialogue generation, and incorporating AI into assignments. We will also discuss using ChatGPT with teaching strategies like Think, Pair, Share and examine ways to predict and grade ChatGPT’s responses.

# 31. Check an Essay to See if AI Wrote It

Are you concerned that your students are just turning in content created with artificial intelligence? Ask chatGPT if students wrote an essay with artificial intelligence or not. Here is the prompt I use. I include the essay within quotes.

Was this written by artificial intelligence? “<essay>”

I used this prompt for content that I generated with chatGPT, and this was the response:   
ChatGPT: Yes, this was written by an artificial intelligence.   
I also asked chatGPT for its opinion of my blog post, “Cataloging My Magic Collection With Evernote” and the response was:   
ChatGPT: No, this was not written by artificial intelligence. It appears to be an account of someone’s personal experience with organizing their collection of magic resources using Evernote and the benefits they have experienced as a result.   
I used chatGPT to assist with part of the article. In large part, this article was my work with AI contributions.

# 32. Critical Analysis of AI Generate Text

Have students write an AI-generated article and then critique it for accuracy.15 Let your students use chatGPT to create a first draft and paste it into a word processor. They should also include the prompt they used for chatGPT. Once in the word processor, they should turn on track changes and improve the document. Using comments, they can justify the decisions they are making.

# 33. Debate Assistance

Students can use chatGPT to generate arguments and counterarguments on a given topic to prepare for class debates. They can also respond and ask chatGPT for a rebuttal.

In the example below, I asked chatGPT to weigh in on using artificial intelligence in school.

Convince me that artificial intelligence should be used in school.

ChatGPT: Artificial intelligence can be used in schools to personalize learning, provide real-time feedback to students and teachers, and assist with administrative tasks. Personalized learning allows students to learn at their own pace and focus on areas where they need the most help. Real-time feedback can help students improve their understanding of a subject and identify areas where they need more support. AI can also assist with administrative tasks such as grading and scheduling, freeing up teachers to focus on instruction and student engagement. Additionally, AI can also be used to provide insights on student behavior and performance, which can help educators make informed decisions about how to improve teaching and learning.

# Convince me that artificial intelligence should be banned in school.

ChatGPT: There are several reasons why some people may argue that artificial intelligence should be banned in schools. One concern is that AI systems can perpetuate and amplify biases in the data they are trained on, which can lead to unfair treatment of students. Additionally, some argue that the use of AI in schools may lead to a loss of personalization in education, as teachers and students may rely too heavily on automated systems to provide instruction and feedback. There is also a concern that AI systems may take over the role of human teachers and make them obsolete, leading to job loss. Furthermore, there is a fear that the use of AI in schools could decrease critical thinking and creativity in students, as they may become too dependent on automated systems to solve problems.

Debate me on the use of artificial intelligence in higher education. I believe it should be used. You are to take the opposing side.

ChatGPT: I understand. As an AI model, I am not capable of having personal beliefs or opinions. However, in order to debate the use of AI in higher education, I can present arguments from the opposing side.

One argument against the use of AI in higher education is that it may lead to a loss of personal interaction and human connection in the classroom. The use of AI-powered tutors, for example, may lead to students relying too heavily on technology and not developing the critical thinking and problemsolving skills that come with interacting with a human teacher.

Another argument against the use of AI in higher education is that it could exacerbate existing inequalities and create a digital divide. Not all students have access to the technology and resources needed to take advantage of AIassisted learning.

Additionally, AI in education may also lead to an over-reliance on datadriven decision making, which can be limiting as it does not take into account context and personal circumstances, leading to a one-size-fits-all approach to education.

On the other hand, AI could also bring a lot of benefits to higher education, such as providing personalised learning experiences, increasing student engagement, and allowing teachers to spend more time working one-on-one with students.

It’s important to consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI in higher education before making a decision.

# 34. Write Interactive Fiction

Students can use ChatGPT to explore an interactive fiction story or chooseyour-own-adventure story. Provide a starting prompt, and enjoy the adventure.

Create a story about a wanderer traveling through a haunted forest.   
Stop at decision points so that I can provide direction.

ChatGPT: Once upon a time, there was a wanderer named Jack. Jack loved to explore the unknown and one day, he decided to venture into a haunted forest. As he entered the forest, he saw that the trees were gnarled and twisted, and the air was thick with mist. Jack felt a chill run down his spine, but he was determined to see what lay beyond the forest. As he walked deeper into the forest, he heard strange noises in the distance. The rustling of leaves, the snapping of branches, and the whispering of voices. Jack couldn’t tell if it was the wind or something else. As he walked, Jack came across a fork in the road, one path led to the left and the other to the right. Which path should Jack take? left or right?

# Go left

ChatGPT: Jack decided to take the left path. As he walked, he saw that the trees were getting denser and the path was becoming narrower. He felt like he was being watched, but he couldn’t see anyone or anything.

Soon, Jack came across a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a large, ancient looking tree. It was unlike any tree Jack had ever seen. Its trunk was thick and gnarled, and its branches twisted and turned in every direction. Jack couldn’t help but feel drawn to the tree.

Suddenly, Jack heard a voice coming from the tree. The voice was soft and melodic, and it said “I am the guardian of this forest. I can help you find your way out, but you must first answer my riddle.”

Jack was intrigued and agreed to the tree’s request. The tree asked him: “I am not alive, but I grow; I don’t have lungs, but I need air; I don’t have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?”

What is Jack’s answer to the riddle?

35. Simulation-Based Learning

You can simulate real-world scenarios, such as job interviews or historical events, with chatGPT. Creating these types of scenarios aids students in developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Acting as the director of instructional technology and design, interview me for the role of an entry-level instructional technologist.

ChatGPT: Sure, I can certainly simulate a scenario of an interview for the role of an entry-level instructional technologist.

1. Can you tell me about your experience with learning management systems?   
2. How do you stay current with the latest instructional technology trends?   
3. Can you give an example of a project you have led in the past that involved instructional technology?   
4. How do you approach the design and development of online course content?

technology?

10. How do you involve and obtain feedback from students on the use of instructional technology in their learning experience?

Please answer those questions and let me know if you need more elaboration on any specific question.

Acting as the campus safety officer, you are faced with the presence of an active shooter on campus. What is the first thing you should do? Only provide one step.

ChatGPT: The first thing a campus safety officer should do in the case of an active shooter on campus is to immediately call 911 and alert local law enforcement of the active shooter situation.

# What is the next step?

ChatGPT: After calling 911, the next step for a campus safety officer would be to clear and secure the immediate area and to direct people to safe locations such as designated shelter-in-place areas or to evacuate the building if it is safe to do so. It’s also crucial to activate the emergency notification system to alert the campus community of the situation and provide instructions on what to do.

# 36. Dialogue Generation

You can use chatGPT to generate dialogue for role-playing or simulation exercises, helping students to develop their social and communication skills. All you need to do is provide chatGPT with a scenario and let it go. Here is an example:

Write dialogue for the following scenario, “You are the sales manager of a company that specializes in the production of high-quality, eco-friendly products. You have been working on a proposal for a large potential customer for weeks, and you have a meeting scheduled with them next week to present your proposal and try to close the deal. However, you know that this potential customer has been a loyal customer of one of your competitors, who offers lower prices than your company. You are worried that the lower prices offered by your competitor will be a major obstacle in your efforts to close the deal with this potential customer.”

ChatGPT: You: Good morning, it’s great to finally meet with you in person. I’ve been working on a proposal for our eco-friendly products that I think will be a great fit for your company.

Potential Customer: Yes, we’re always looking for ways to be more environmentally conscious in our operations. But I have to be honest with you, we’ve been a loyal customer of one of your competitors for a while now, and their prices are significantly lower than yours.

You: I understand your concern, and I want to address that head-on. While our prices may be higher, I can assure you that the quality of our products is unmatched. We use only the most sustainable materials and production methods, and we have strict quality control measures in place to ensure that our products are the best on the market. Additionally, our products are designed to last longer, which means less waste and fewer replacements in the long run.

Potential Customer: That’s certainly something to consider. Can you give me an example of how the cost would compare in the long term?

You: Absolutely. For example, one of our products is a line of energyefficient light bulbs. They may be more expensive upfront, but they last longer and use less energy, which means lower electricity bills for your company in the long run.

Potential Customer: That does make sense. Can you provide any data or case studies to back up those claims?

You: Of course, I have several case studies and data that I can provide you with after the meeting that will give you a better idea of the long-term cost savings of our products.

Potential Customer: Alright, I’m definitely interested in learning more. Let’s go through the proposal and see if it aligns with our needs.

You: Great, I appreciate the opportunity to present our proposal to you. I believe that our eco-friendly products will not only be beneficial for the environment but also for your bottom line in the long run. Thank you for considering our company.

# 37. Require AI Use as Part of Assignments

Each discipline has its tools and methods for completing work. In higher ed, educators teach and encourage students to use these tools, calculators, spreadsheets, grammar checkers, etc., to complete assignments. Add applications like chatGPT to the toolset. Students can use ChatGPT for:

7. Supply Chain optimization, which uses AI to optimize logistics and inventory management.

Discuss how AI is used in your discipline and share your findings with your students.16

39. Use With Think, Pair, Share

Think, pair, and share is an effective active learning strategy. What if you had students incorporate chatGPT into this learning method? You could have students think and then pair. However, before they share, they could query chatGPT and discuss their findings before sharing with the class.17

# 40. Predict chatGPT’s Response

Include chatGPT as an active member of your class. Before you press return on a chatGPT question, poll the students in the class. Ask the students what they predict chatGPT will answer. You can then compare the student responses to what chatGPT provided.18

# 41. Grade chatGPT’s Response

Use chatGPT to create a document. It could be an essay, report, business plan, or any other paper that serves your assignment purposes. Then, have students “grade” the results using rubrics, checklists, or other criteria. Let them see and understand the strengths and weaknesses of artificial intelligence.19

Chapter Seven

# Ways Students can Use chatGPT

Students can take advantage of cutting-edge technology to accelerate their learning. ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can serve as a tutor in many different ways, including writing assistance, language translation, language discussion partner, digital tutor, Q&A session, speech and presentation assistance, digital storytelling, summarizing articles, clarifying topics, personalized learning, and research assistance. With ChatGPT, students can work directly with a digital tutor to expand on notes, explain complex concepts, and achieve their full potential. So whether your student is looking to improve their writing skills or a language learner looking for a conversation partner, ChatGPT is available to help them achieve their goals.

# 42. Writing Assistance

Students can use GPT to help them write essays, research papers, and other assignments. In addition, the model can assist with grammar, vocabulary, and organization of ideas.

You can have students use chatGPT for feedback on their writing assignments before submission. They can also use it while they are revising

their drafts.20

Here is an example of it in action. I am asking chatGPT to provide feedback on my blog post, “Cataloging My Magic Collection With Evernote.”

What recommendations do you have for improving this blog post? “<essay>”

ChatGPT:

1. Break the post into shorter paragraphs to make it easier to read.   
2. Use headings and subheadings to organize the post and make it more visually appealing.   
3. Provide more context on the topic at the beginning of the post to give readers a better understanding of the subject.   
4. Use specific examples to illustrate key points throughout the post.   
5. Add images, videos or infographics to make the post more engaging and easier to understand.   
6. Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize the instructions and make them more easily readable.   
7. Make sure to proofread the post for grammar and spelling errors.

10. Finally, make sure to add a call to action at the end of the post, encouraging readers to share their thoughts or ask questions in the comments section or through email.

# 43. Language Translation

ChatGPT opens up the world. You and your students can use chatGPT to understand and translate text into other languages. These translations can help to understand the grammar and structure of the language. Many tools are available to help translate articles and other blocks of text.   
From my experience, it could be a better translation, but the translation will enable one to understand the essence of the text. Do not rely on chatGPT to translate text for professional output, such as a book.   
It is best to translate from the original language to the desired language. I do not recommend translating from one language to another and then another, such as going from Russian to English and then Dutch. Instead, translate from Russian to English and Russian to Dutch.

The prompt is straightforward.

# Translate to <desired language> “<text>”

International students can draft essays in their native language and have chatGPT convert the draft into an English version. They can then improve the drafts through rewriting. 21

# 44. Language Discussion Partner

Students can use chatGPT as a conversation partner. Start with a simple introduction and see where the conversation goes. Then, you can have students critique the output at the end of the conversation. While chatGPT will tirelessly participate as a discussion partner, its responses are not always perfect. Can students note the grammatical errors? Can they engage in conversation?

Hoi, ik heet Stan

ChatGPT: Hallo Stan, hoe kan ik je van dienst zijn?

# Kan je met mij praten?

ChatGPT: Natuurlijk, ik ben hier om te communiceren en om je te helpen met informatie of antwoorden op eventuele vragen die je hebt. Wat wil je graag bespreken?

# 45. Digital Tutor

ChatGPT can serve as a digital tutor for students. They can ask chatGPT anytime they have a question about their material. Individuals can tailor the answer to meet their abilities. Here is an example of answering the question, “what is artificial intelligence?”

# What is artificial intelligence?

ChatGPT: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language understanding. AI systems can be divided into two categories: weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI is designed to perform specific tasks, such as image recognition, and is used in a wide range of applications, such as selfdriving cars and virtual personal assistants. Strong AI, on the other hand, is designed to be capable of any intellectual task that a human can perform, and is still a topic of research and debate. Some of the techniques used in AI include machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing.

# What is artificial intelligence? Explain to a 7-year-old.

ChatGPT: Artificial intelligence, or AI, is when we teach computers to do things that usually only people can do. Like when you play a game on your phone and the computer can play too. It can also help us with things like talking to our phones or making cars drive by themselves. It’s like giving the computer a brain to think and make decisions like we do. It’s like having a robot helper that can do things for us. It’s not a real robot, but it can do some similar things.

What is artificial intelligence? Explain to a 16-year-old.

ChatGPT: Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the field of computer science that focuses on creating machines and software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes tasks such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns in data, problem solving, decision-making and learning from experience. There are different types of AI, such as rule-based AI, which follows a set of predefined rules, and machine learning, which uses algorithms and statistical models to enable the system to learn and improve from data. AI is widely used in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and retail. It is also becoming more common in our everyday lives, such as in virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and personalized recommendations in online platforms.

Instructors are only sometimes available when you need them most, for example, late in the evening while doing homework. Students can feed chatGPT questions based on the class material. ChatGPT can then break down the material to help the students understand confusing concepts.

# 47. Speech and Presentation Assistance

Students can use chatGPT to help prepare speeches and presentations. They can use chatGPT to generate ideas and organize their thoughts. The key to getting the best results from chatGPT is crafting specific prompts. A lot of critical thinking is involved.

# 48. Digital Storytelling

Students can use chatGPT to generate text for digital stories or interactive fiction. A simple prompt will get the story started. Adding details to the

prompt helps direct the story. It is up to one’s imagination. Enjoy this AIgenerated story.

# Write a story about an old man hiking in the Catskill Mountains who meets a down-and-out magician.

ChatGPT: Once upon a time, there was an old man named Frank who loved nothing more than hiking in the Catskill Mountains. Every year, he would pack up his bags and make the journey to the mountains, where he would spend his days exploring the trails and taking in the beautiful scenery.

One day, as he was making his way up a particularly steep trail, he came across a strange sight. At the bottom of a rocky outcropping, he saw a man sitting with his head in his hands. As Frank approached, he could see that the man was clearly down on his luck. His clothes were tattered and torn, and he looked as though he had not slept or eaten in days.

Being a kind-hearted man, Frank approached the stranger and asked if he was okay. The man looked up at him with a sad smile and said, “I’m a magician, or at least I used to be. But my luck has run out and I’ve lost everything.”

Frank was intrigued by the man’s story and asked him how he had come to be in such a state. The magician explained that he had been traveling from town to town, performing his tricks for audiences big and small. But one day, his luck had run out and he had lost everything - his props, his money, and even his magic wand.

Feeling sympathetic to the man’s plight, Frank offered to help the magician. He gave him some food and water, and even offered to let him stay with him for the night. The magician gratefully accepted and the two men set up camp together.

As they sat around the campfire that night, the magician began to tell Frank about his past and all the incredible tricks he had performed. Frank listened in awe as the magician spoke of levitating objects and making people disappear, and he could tell that the man truly had been a master of his craft. The next day, Frank and the magician set off on their hike together. As they walked, the magician began to regain his confidence and Frank could see that the spark of magic was beginning to come back to him. By the end of the day, the magician had even managed to make a small bird appear from thin air.

From that day on, Frank and the magician became good friends. They hiked together every year in the Catskill Mountains, and the magician even started to perform his tricks again for small crowds in the local towns. Frank was happy to have helped his new friend, and he knew that the magic of the mountains had played a big role in bringing the magician back to life.

# 49. Summarizing Articles

You or your students can use chatGPT to generate summaries of articles or other texts to understand the key points better.

The chatGPT prompt is straightforward. For example, I asked chatGPT to summarize Lumen Learning’s Biology for Majors I, Module 5: Cell Membranes, Structure of the Cell Membrane. Naturally, as a subject matter expert, it would be up to you to ensure it makes sense.

# Summarize “<article>”

ChatGPT: The plasma membrane is a thin layer that surrounds and encloses a cell, it separates the cell’s internal environment from its external environment. The main components of the cell membrane are phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates. Phospholipids are composed of two main parts: a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head. Cholesterol helps to maintain the membrane’s fluidity and stability. Proteins play a variety of roles including providing structural support, acting as receptors, and transporting molecules across the membrane. Carbohydrates are molecules that are found on the surface of the plasma membrane and play a role in cell recognition and communication. The fluid mosaic model describes the plasma membrane structure as a fluid combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates.

# 50. Clarifying Topics

Sometimes concepts are very complex or not explained well. You can ask chatGPT to clarify a concept. For example, use it to explain the difference between concepts or words such as affect and effect or sociopath and psychopath. Here are a couple of examples:

# What is the difference between affect and effect?

ChatGPT: “Affect” and “effect” are two commonly confused words in the English language.   
“Affect” is a verb that means to influence or change something. It can also refer to the observable expression of emotion, such as a smile or a frown. For example, “The new law will affect the way businesses operate” or “His affect was flat, indicating he was feeling nothing”   
“Effect” is a noun that refers to the result or outcome of an action or event. For example, “The effect of the new law on businesses was significant” or “The effect of the medication was immediate”.   
In short, “affect” is something that does the action, and “effect” is the outcome of the action.

# What is artificial intelligence?

ChatGPT: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. It involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

There are several branches of AI, including:

Reactive machines: AI systems that react to the environment without any memory of past events.   
Limited memory: AI systems that can remember and use past experiences to inform current decisions.   
General AI: AI systems that have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.   
Strong AI: AI systems that have the same cognitive capabilities as a human and can also be conscious.

The field of AI is rapidly evolving, with new technologies and techniques being developed all the time. Some of the current and potential applications of AI include self-driving cars, virtual personal assistants, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting.

# 51. Personalized Learning

You or your students can generate personalized learning materials. You can then tailor the results to their specific needs and learning styles. When asked, chatGPT shared these ideas for customizing learning content:

1. Custom reading materials: GPT can be used to generate reading materials at different reading levels, which can be tailored to the

specific needs of each student.

2. Interactive quizzes and exercises: GPT can generate interactive quizzes and exercises that are tailored to a student’s areas of weakness, helping them to better understand the material.

3. Personalized feedback and suggestions: GPT can generate personalized feedback and suggestions for students based on their performance on assessments and their learning progress.

4. Interactive and engaging learning experiences: GPT can generate custom dialogues, stories, and scenarios that can help students to better understand and retain the material.

5. Personalized summaries and study guides: GPT can generate personalized summaries and study guides, which can help students to quickly review and reinforce key concepts.

6. Automated assessment: GPT can also be used to automatically grade student’s answers, provide feedback and generate personalized study plans.

7. Personalized Tutoring: GPT can be used to provide personalized tutoring, by generating tailored responses to student’s questions, and providing explanations and examples.

To implement these use cases, GPT can be trained on specific educational content and then fine-tuned using student data such as their answers to quizzes, assessments, and surveys about their learning styles and preferences. Additionally, the system can be integrated with an LMS(Learning Management System) to provide real-time feedback and generate personalized learning paths for each student.

# 52. Research Assistance

Students can use chatGPT to assist with all aspects of research. Researchers can use chatGPT to:

Discover research topics   
Build keyword lists   
Develop research questions   
Create annotated bibliographies   
Create outlines   
Paraphrase content   
Find credible sources   
Summarize information   
Provide editing advice   
Draft sections of a document

It’s important to note that while ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for research assistance, students should still verify the accuracy of the information and use it in conjunction with other sources.

# 53. Expand on Notes

As students review their class notes, they may realize they are incomplete. They can use ChatGPT to expand on the notes to add clarity. For example, I asked chatGPT to expand on these notes:   
Expand on these notes   
Motivation is a concept that explains why people behave as they do. Psychologists concerned with learning and education use the word

motivation to describe processes that: Arouse and instigate behavior Give direction or purpose to behavior Continue to allow behavior to persist Lead to choosing or preferring a particular behavior When there is no motivation to leam, there is no leaming. It is wise not to romanticize or expect too much of motivation. Such a view can limit our resourcefulness and increase our frustration.

ChatGPT: Motivation is a key factor in understanding and predicting human behavior. It is the driving force that initiates and sustains behavior, giving it direction and purpose. Without motivation, people will not engage in any behavior or action.

Psychologists who study learning and education recognize the importance of motivation in the learning process. They have found that motivation plays a crucial role in determining whether or not a person will engage in a task or activity, how much effort they will put into it, and how long they will continue to do it. People who are motivated to learn tend to have a greater sense of purpose, focus, and persistence, which leads to more successful learning outcomes.

The statement “When there is no motivation to learn, there is no learning” emphasizes the importance of motivation in the learning process. Without motivation, people will not engage in the behaviors and actions necessary to learn new information or skills.

However, it is also important to not have unrealistic expectations of motivation. Some may have the belief that motivation is this magical force that always makes people do things, but in reality, people are complex and their motivation levels can vary greatly depending on different factors such as personal goals, values, and interests. Additionally, sometimes external factors such as stress, lack of resources, or difficult life circumstances can make it challenging to motivate oneself. It is important to recognize that motivation is not always constant, and that there may be times when people need to find alternative ways to sustain their behavior, such as by focusing on the benefits of the task, breaking it down into smaller steps, or finding a way to make the task more interesting or enjoyable. In this way, by not romanticizing or expecting too much of motivation, we can increase our resourcefulness and decrease our frustration when faced with obstacles.

Chapter Eight

# Using chatGPT for Computer Programming

This chapter will teach you how to utilize chatGPT to streamline your coding process. With chatGPT, you can quickly write code in various languages. Provide specific input, and let chatGPT work its magic. Not only can chatGPT write code and explain what it does, but it also can troubleshoot any issues, write SQL code, clean up HTML code, write application scripts, and even add comments to your code. By the end of this chapter, you will have a better understanding of how to use chatGPT to improve your coding efficiency.

# 54. Write Code

Do you need any help writing code? Explain what you want to accomplish and which language to use. ChatGPT will do its best to deliver code you can use. Some people have written entire applications in collaboration with chatGPT.

Here is an example of a simple script:

Write database connection code in PHP to display data as an HTML table with the following information: name, address, city, state, and zip

code.

ChatGPT:

Here is an example of how to display data from a table named “address_lis in a MySQL database as an HTML table using PHP:   
<?php   
\$servername $=$ “localhost”;   
\$username $=$ “your_username”;   
\$password $=$ “your_password”;   
\$dbname $=$ “your_database”;   
// Create connection   
\$conn = new mysqli(\$servername, \$username, \$password, \$dbname); // Check connection   
if (\$conn->connect_error) {   
die(“Connection failed: “ . \$conn- $>$ connect_error);   
}   
// Select data from table   
$\$ 5 q l =\ " S E L E C T$ name, address, city, state, zipcode FROM address_list”; $\$ 123,456$   
echo “<table>   
<tr>   
<th>Name</th>   
<th>Address</th>   
<th>City</th>   
<th>State</th>   
<th>Zip Code</th>   
</tr>”;   
// Output data of each row   
while(\$row $=$ \$result- $\mathrm { . > }$ fetch_assoc()) { echo “<tr>   
<td>“.\$row[”name”].”</td> <td>“.\$row[”address”].”</td> <td>“.\$row[”city”].”</td>   
<td>“.\$row[”state”].”</td> <td>“.\$row[”zipcode”].”</td> </tr>”   
}   
echo “</table>”;   
\$conn- $. >$ close();

This code uses the MySQLi extension to select data from the “address_list” table, then it iterates through the resulting rows and adds them to an HTML table. The table headers are created using $< t h >$ tags and the data rows are created using $< t d >$ tags. It is important to note that you should change the \$username, \$password, \$dbname and $\$ 8$ servername variable with your actual credentials. Also, make sure that table “address_list” already exists otherwise you will get an error message.

# 55. Explain What Code Does

Do you have a piece of computer code that you are not sure of the language or what it does? ChatGPT would be happy to tell you. Paste in a code block and ask chatGPT to explain what the code does.

Set fs $\equiv$ Server.CreateObject(“Scripting.FileSystemObject”) Set $\mathbf { f } =$ fs.OpenTextFile(Server.MapPath(“testread.txt”), 1) do while f.AtEndOfStream $=$ false

Response.Write(f.ReadLine)   
Response.Write(“<br>”)   
loop   
f.Close   
Set $\mathbf { f } \equiv$ Nothing   
Set fs $\ c =$ Nothing   
$\% >$

# Explanation of what the code does

ChatGPT:

This is a server-side script written in VBScript, typically embedded in an ASP (Active Server Pages) file.

The script uses the Server.CreateObject method to create an instance of the “Scripting.FileSystemObject” object, which is used to interact with the file system. This object is saved in the variable fs.

Then, the script opens a text file named “testread.txt” located in the same directory as the ASP file, using the OpenTextFile method of the fs object. The variable f holds the file object.

The script then enters a loop, using the do while statement to check if the file is at the end of the stream, which means if the file is at the end of the file. If it is not, it uses the ReadLine method to read the next line of the file and writes it to the response using Response.Write. It also writes a line break using Response.Write( $^ { \prime 6 6 } < b r > ^ { 5 9 } )$ to separate the lines of the file.

Once the end of the file is reached, the script closes the file using f.Close and sets the f and fs variables to Nothing to release the memory used by the file object and filesystem object.

In short, this script reads the contents of a text file named “testread.txt” located in the same directory as the ASP file and writes each line of the file to the response, separated by a line break.

# 56. Troubleshoot Scripts

ChatGPT can help you troubleshoot code. Ask chatGPT to check your code for errors. Here is a quick example in which I introduced two typical errors:

What is wrong with this code   
<?php function familyName(\$fname, \$year) { echo “\$fname Refsnes. Born in \$year <br>”; }   
familyName(“Hege” ,”1975″);   
familyName(“Stale” ,”1978″)   
familyname(“Kai Jim”,”1983″);   
?>

ChatGPT: There are two issues with this code.

1. The last function call is using “familyname” instead of “familyName” (notice the uppercase “N” in the correct version). This means that the function will not be called, and an error will occur.   
2. The second call to the function is missing a semicolon at the end of the line. This will cause a parse error and the code will not execute correctly. It should be like : familyName(“Stale”,”1978″);

# 57. Write SQL Code

Working with database query languages can be tricky and time-consuming but essential if working with MySQL, Oracle SQL, or even Microsoft Access. ChatGPT will help you write queries quickly by translating your intent into SQL code. Here is an example using Postgres SQL:

Postgres SQL tables, with their properties:

Employee(id, name, department_id)   
Department(id, name, address)   
Salary_Payments(id, employee_id, amount, date)   
A query to list the names of the departments which employed more than   
10 employees in the last 3 months

ChatGPT:

SELECT Department.name FROM Employee   
INNER JOIN Department ON Employee.department_id $=$ Department.id WHERE Employee.id IN ( SELECT Salary_Payments.employee_id FROM Salary_Payments   
WHERE date >= NOW() - INTERVAL ‘3 months’ )   
GROUP BY Department.id   
HAVING COUNT(Employee.id) > 10;   
The above query will join the Employee and Department table on the department_id column, and then it will filter the results to only include the employees that have a salary payment record in the last 3 months. After that the query will group the results by department and count the number of employees for each department. Finally, the having clause will filter the results to only include the departments that have more than 10 employees.

# 58. Clean Up HTML Code

Copying content from a word processor or a website into a learning management system (LMS) or web page will often introduce nonessential HTML code. This extra code can make editing more challenging. I like to strip out unnecessary code. ChatGPT will do the job for you. Here is an example:

Clean up this HTML code “<h2 style=”;”><strong>Criminology: Theories of Crime</strong></h2> <p style=”;”><img src $\cdot ^ { = }$ ”https://mysite.com/myimage.jpg” width $\mathbf { \lambda } = \mathbf { \lambda } ^ { \mathbf { p } } \mathbf { 6 4 0 } \mathbf { \lambda } ^ { \prime \prime }$ height $=$ ”354″ dataapi-endpoint=”https://mysite.com/myimage.jpg” data-apireturntype $=$ ”File” /> </p> <h2 style $\mathbf { \alpha } = \mathbf { i }$ ”;”><strong>Welcome! </strong> </h2> <p style $\mathbf { \delta } = \mathbf { \delta }$ ”;”><strong><i>I am thrilled to be instructing this

# 59. Write Application Scripts

ChatGPT can convert your intent into action. For example, you can improve the functionality of your software applications through the use of scripting. You can create solutions to your problems using chatGPT. ChatGPT can write scripts for Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Linux products. You can also enhance specific products like spreadsheets or word-processing programs. For example, I am interested in prefixing all my file names in a directory with “stan_”. Here is the prompt I wrote:

Write a PowerShell Script that will add a “stan_” to the beginning of all file names in a directory.   
ChatGPT:   
# Get the current directory   
$\$ 123,456$ -Location   
# Get all the files in the directory   
\$files $=$ Get-ChildItem -Path \$dir   
# Loop through each file   
foreach (\$file in \$files) {   
# Check if the file is not a directory   
if (-not \$file.PSIsContainer) {   
# Create the new file name by adding “stan_” to the beginning of the current file name   
\$newFileName $=$ “stan_” $+$ \$file.Name   
# Rename the file   
Rename-Item \$file.FullName \$newFileName   
}   
}   
This script will get the current directory, retrieve all the files in that directory and loop through each file. For each file that it finds, it will check if it is not a directory and then create a new file name by adding “stan_” to the beginning of the current file name. Finally, it will rename the file with the new file name.

What problems are you trying to fix?

60. Add Comments To Your Code

In the examples above, you can see that chatGPT can be a great assistant in writing code and explaining what the code does. You can also ask chatGPT to document the scripts that you have.22

Rewrite code below and add comments:   
<?php   
require_once ‘_db.php’;   
\$stmt $=$ \$db->prepare(‘SELECT \* FROM ev $< =$ :start) OR (start $> =$ :end))’);   
\$stmt- $>$ bindParam(‘:start’ , $\$ 1$ _GET[’start’]); \$stmt- $. >$ bindParam(‘:end’ , $\$ 1$ _GET[’end’]); \$stmt->execute();   
\$result $=$ \$stmt->fetchAll();   
class Event {}   
\$events $=$ array();   
foreach(\$result as \$row) {   
\$e = new Event();   
$\mathbf { \$ 6vec { - } > i d } = \mathbf { \$ 10 w } [ \mathbf { \vec { 1 } d } ^ { \prime } ] ;$   
$\mathbf { \$ { e } - > t e x t } = \mathbf { \ S r o w [ ^ { \epsilon } { n a m e } ^ { \prime } ] } ;$   
\$e->start $=$ \$row[‘start’];   
$\mathbf { \$ { e } - > { e n d } } = \$ \mathbf { r o w } [ \mathbf { { ' e n d } ^ { \circ } } ] ;$   
\$events[] = \$e;   
}   
echo json_encode(\$events);   
?>   
chatGPT:   
<?php   
// require the _db.php file

require_once ‘_db.php’;

// Prepare a SELECT statement to retrieve events from the ‘events’ table where the end date is after the start date passed in $\$ 62$ variable.

$\ S s t m t \ = \ \ S d b \ – > p r e p a r e ( \ S E L E C T \ ^ { \ast } \ F R O M \ e$ vents WHERE NOT ((end <= :start) OR (start $> =$ :end))’);   
// Bind the start and end parameters from $\$ 8$ _GET variable to the statement \$stmt- $>$ bindParam(‘:start’, \$_GET[’start’]);   
\$stmt- $>$ bindParam(‘:end’, \$_GET[’end’]);   
// Execute the statement   
\$stmt- $>$ execute();   
// Fetch all rows of data from the query and store it in the \$result variable \$result $=$ \$stmt->fetchAll();   
// Create an empty Event class   
class Event {}   
// Create an empty array to store event objects   
\$events $=$ array();   
// Iterate through each row of data returned from the query   
foreach(\$result as \$row) {   
// Create a new Event object   
\$e = new Event();   
// Assign the values from the row to the properties of the Event object   
$\begin{array} { r l } & { \ S e \mathrm { - } s i d = \ S r o w [ ^ { \ast } i d ^ { \prime } J ; } \\ & { \ S e \mathrm { - } s t e x t = \ S r o w [ ^ { \ast } n a m e ^ { \ast } J ; } \\ & { \ S e \mathrm { - } s t a r t = \ S r o w [ ^ { \ast } s t a r t ^ { \prime } J ; } \\ & { \ S e \mathrm { - } e n d = \ S r o w [ ^ { \ast } e n d ^ { \prime } J ; } \end{array}$   
// Add the Event object to the events array   
$\$ 123,456,7$ }   
// Encode the events array as JSON and echo it echo json_encode(\$events);

# Other Uses

The need for efficient and practical tools to manage tasks is growing as the world becomes more technology-driven. ChatGPT has proven to be a valuable asset for teaching, learning, and other purposes. This chapter will introduce the versatility of ChatGPT as an executive assistant, showcasing its ability to create blog posts, write book reviews, draft grant proposals, and much more. By leveraging the power of ChatGPT, individuals and organizations can easily enhance their productivity and achieve their goals.

# 61. Create Blog Posts

Blogs help share content with your community on classroom activities, disciplines, research projects, or programs. Unfortunately, they take time to maintain. Often bloggers struggle to come up with ideas to write about. ChatGPT can help speed up the writing process and provide an infinite source of blogging ideas. Let’s look at ways you can use chatGPT to support your blog.

Provide me with 10 ideas to blog about related to: using blogs in the classroom

chatGPT:

1. The benefits of incorporating blogs in the classroom for student engagement and learning.

9. How can teachers effectively respond to questions and concerns raised by parents through the blog?   
10. What are the limitations and potential challenges of using blogs for parent-teacher communication and collaboration?

Next, I would choose a couple of questions and have chatGPT answer them. You could copy and paste a previously generated question into chatGPT to get an answer.

How does a blog help keep parents informed about their child’s progress in the classroom?

ChatGPT:

A blog can help keep parents informed about their child’s progress in the classroom by providing regular updates and sharing important information, such as:

1. Class announcements and updates.   
2. Student work and accomplishments, such as essays, projects, and tests.   
3. Class schedules and homework assignments.   
4. Grades and progress reports.   
5. Photos and videos of class activities and events.

By having this information readily accessible and easily shareable, parents can stay informed about their child’s education and stay up-to-date on what is happening in the classroom. It also helps foster communication and collaboration between parents and teachers, allowing them to work together to support student learning and growth.

Keep asking chatGPT questions until you are satisfied. Finally, edit the blog post to make it your own. Ensure you provide attribution if you use AI to help generate a blog post. 23

# 62. Write a Book Rreview

Do you have a book list for your class or discipline? Is it just a list, or do you also share a little about the books? Drafting reviews or summaries can take time. Once again, chatGPT can come to your aid. Here are two examples:

# 66. Draft Email Messages

ChatGPT can save you an incredible amount of time by drafting email messages. It can prepare messages for routine tasks or one-time conversations. Naturally, personalize the results for your audience.

# Draft an email explaining why it would be better for the library to be assigned to academic affairs versus information technology. List key points as bullets.

ChatGPT: Subject: Library Operations and Academic Affairs Dear [Recipient],

I am writing to express my belief that the library should be assigned to the academic affairs department rather than the information technology department. Here are the key points that support my position:

The library is a vital resource for research and study on campus, and should be closely tied to the academic needs of the students and faculty. By aligning the library with academic affairs, we can ensure that the library’s resources and services support the curriculum, research and academic goals of the institution.

Placing the library under academic affairs will facilitate better communication and collaboration between the library and academic departments, allowing for more effective and efficient use of resources. This will also allow for a more coordinated and cohesive approach to library services and instruction, which will ultimately benefit our students.

Information technology is an important aspect of library operations, but it is not the primary focus of the library. Assigning the library to the information technology department could lead to a disconnect between the library and the academic needs of the institution, and may not fully leverage the library’s potential to support the academic mission.

In summary, I believe that assigning the library to academic affairs will better support the academic goals of the institution and provide the most

benefit to our students.   
Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. Sincerely, [Your name]

He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence.

ChatGPT: This data represents scores or evaluations for various discussions or training sessions within an IRA (Instructional Research Association) program. The numbers indicate the participants’ scores or evaluations for each discussion or session. Each row represents scores for a particular group of participants.

Based on the data, most of the discussions received high scores, with a majority of participants scoring between 12 and 15. This indicates that the majority of participants found these discussions to be valuable and informative. The lower scores appear to be more sporadic, with some participants finding certain sessions less helpful.

The scores also indicate some variability in the participants’ evaluations, with some participants giving higher scores to certain discussions than others. This suggests that the usefulness of the discussions may depend on the participants’ individual needs and interests.

Overall, the data provides insight into the quality and effectiveness of the IRA program and the discussions offered within it. It can be used to identify areas for improvement, better understand the needs and preferences of participants, and ensure the program continues to meet their expectations.

# 78. Summarize Your Articles

Do you need to create an executive summary for a report or an abstract for an article you wrote? Then, let chatGPT take the first crack at it.25 For example, here is an executive summary of a 2016 SUNYCIT conference trip report (bit.ly/3wEuYDO).

# Write an executive summary based on this information: <report details>

ChatGPT: The SUNY JCC conference focused on the use of technology to support education. The highlights of the conference were grouped under themes: Blackboard Goals and Course Alignments, Digital Badges and

Micro-credentialing, Open Educational Resources, Accessibility, and Miscellaneous initiatives. The conference emphasized the importance of building courses aligned with learning objectives and using Open Educational Resources for better retention and completion. It also stressed the importance of making courses and supporting materials accessible from the beginning. For the upcoming year, the focus will be on developing a badging constellation for faculty professional development in technologyenhanced instruction, exposing faculty to open educational resources, stressing the importance of accessibility, and increasing the online workshop catalog.

# 79. TL;DR Summaries

Do you have a mountain of content to sift through before your next meeting? Would you like to get the Reader’s Digest version? Then, feed chatGPT your long-form articles and ask for a summary of essential information.26 You may have to input content in sections because of chatGPT limitations. Not familiar with TL;DR, not a problem. It stands for “Too Long, Didn’t Read.”

# 80. Translate Research Articles

ChatGPT has opened up the world of research. Are you discovering essential articles written in languages other than your own? ChatGPT can help you translate the papers so that you can grasp the essence of the article.27

Because of the prompt size limitations, you may have to copy and paste the article one section at a time. This example is a translation of the abstract from El fenómeno de las necesidades de información en el contexto de la Web 2.0 en estudiantes de administración en el municipio de Atlixco, Puebla by Albano Torres-Gómez.

Translate to English: “Este trabajo analiza el fenómeno de las necesidades de información a partir de su surgimiento, comportamiento y satisfacción, integrando los rasgos del usuario 2.0. Los sujetos de estudio son alumnos del área admi- nistrativa de la Sede Atlixco del Complejo Regional Mixteca de la Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP). Mediante la aplicación de un cuestionario, se encontró que la comunidad estudiantil presenta un sentido de pertenencia en construcción con la región de Atlixco; prefiere la modalidad presencial y percibe que su expe- riencia educativa es de la misma calidad en compara- ción con la del campus de la capital. Por otro lado, sus necesidades de información se centran principalmente en la salud emocional, el desarrollo profesional, los via- jes y el desarrollo personal. Los recursos y fuentes de información predominantes son los sitios web, las redes sociales y los videos. Además, se identificó que esta comunidad estudiantil muestra habilidades que corresponden a los rasgos del usuario 2.0; sin embargo, no reportan una satisfacción completa a sus necesidades de información, debido a la aplicación parcial de los criterios de relevancia, preci- sión, vigencia, utilidad y organización durante su com- portamiento informativo.”

ChatGPT: This work analyzes the phenomenon of information needs from its emergence, behavior, and satisfaction, integrating the traits of the user 2.0. The study subjects are administrative area students at the Atlixco campus of the Mixteca Regional Complex of the Autonomous University of Puebla (BUAP). A questionnaire found that the student community presents a sense of belonging in construction with the Atlixco region; they prefer face-to-face and perceive their educational experience to be of the same quality as the one on the capital campus. On the other hand, their information needs are mainly focused on emotional health, professional development, travel, and personal development. The predominant information resources and sources are websites, social networks, and videos. Additionally, this student community shows skills that correspond to the traits of the user 2.0; however, they do not report complete satisfaction with their information needs due to the partial application of the relevance, precision, validity, utility, and organization criteria during their information behavior.

Chapter Ten

# Combatting GPT

ChatGPT is a cutting-edge tool with the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning. However, to fully harness its power, the user must understand how to create effective prompts and evaluate results. Unfortunately, many educators are concerned that students need more foundational knowledge. This chapter explores strategies for shaping instruction to direct the use of ChatGPT in the classroom. Using these ideas, educators can ensure that students are equipped with the necessary skills to use ChatGPT effectively and maximize its potential to enhance learning outcomes.

# Stress Why Writing is Important

Faculty and students approach the purpose of writing from two different perspectives. Faculty see it as a way of thinking and learning, whereas students see it as a way to demonstrate knowledge and meet milestones.28 Faculty are not average. They are two standard deviations from normal. I say this in jest, but faculty have bought into the education system, are experts in their discipline, and have come to understand the purpose of writing through their experiences. Students are skeptics and are still determining the path ahead.

Faculty need to explain and convince students about the benefits of doing their work rather than relying on artificial intelligence to do the work for them. In addition, faculty must refrain from assuming students know how to do research correctly and must model proper research methods. Teaching appropriate research methods may mean having fewer projects to work on and instead spending more time on the writing and rewriting process.

Get Rid of Disposable Assignments

Are you tired of spending countless hours grading essays that are eventually thrown away with little to no impact on the students’ learning? Traditional “disposable assignments” are a waste of both students’ and instructors’ time and effort. However, there is an alternative - “renewable assignments.” These assignments have value beyond the grade, serving as a long-term resource for others to build upon and learn from.

By creating assignments with meaning and purpose, students are more likely to engage and contribute their best work. To enhance student learning and make a meaningful impact, instructors should aim to create authentic assignments, addressing real-world problems and serving a real-world audience. By doing so, students will be motivated to work harder and learn more.

# Use chatGPT as Part of the Assignment

Rather than shy away from using chatGPT in assignments, allow or require its use. Treat tools like chatGPT as math has employed calculators in the classroom. Require that students use AI in specific projects like a writing assistant. Have them document their writing process using these strategies:29

Have students include prompts and responses from chatGPT. Turn on track changes in the word processor to help document the progression. Use track changes to show improvements they made to the document.

Students should become comfortable using AI writing tools as they have come to use grammar and spelling checkers, Wikipedia, auto-correcting, and more. They can use chatGPT for all phases of their writing, from ideation to proofreading. ChatGPT is especially useful for brainstorming or creating first drafts.

Throughout the writing process, have students analyze what they are discovering while using chatGPT.30 ChatGPT is not perfect. Ask students to test and report on the limits.

Assess the Process vs Outcome

AI is changing how employees complete work. At one time, an individual could graduate with a degree and rely on what they learned for a long time. Now, everyone must continuously keep learning because things are changing so rapidly. It is now more important to focus on processes for advancing projects because content is so prevalent on the internet. $3 1$ ChatGPT has made it easier than ever to pull information together. What chatGPT cannot do well is make decisions without humans. Teach students how to set up the solutions for solving the problem. They can then hand the solution to others to collect the data and write the reports.

Information Literacy

Information literacy is at the heart of critical thinking and lifelong learning. In an age of false information, it is essential to contribute to a scholarly conversation with accurate and relevant information.

Scholarship is a conversation. We contribute and extend the discussion at each instance, whether it is a journal article, a class essay, or a conference presentation. Too often, students launch in a monologue rather than a discussion. They often present what they “know” without acknowledging those who contributed to their knowledge. If a student simply takes information from chatGPT without rewriting it or verifying it, the student does not add value to the conversation. Information literacy stresses the importance of dialogue as a form of scholarship. This means that we need to be teaching information literacy in every class.32

# Give Credit to AI Co-writers

A basic tenet in academia is that one gives credit for content used in writing. It is considered an integrity violation when you do not. Therefore, it is essential to provide credit to AI when used.33 Students need to start adhering to this principle from day one.

# Discuss Academic Honesty Expectations

Let students know what your expectations are in terms of the class and the assignments.34

There are times when AI is appropriate and others when it is not. Be explicit when crafting assignments on what is allowed and what is not. For example, if you are not allowing tools like chatGPT, explain why it is essential for them to refrain from using it. What is the educational benefit of the assignment?

Look at your assignments and the value you place on them. If they are highstakes, students may use less-than-desirable strategies to get a higher grade. On the other hand, assignments worth only a few points may not be worth the effort you expect students to devote to them.

Increase the emphasis on the honor code by having students attest to the originality of their work as part of the assignment.  35

# Test Your Assignment in chatGPT

Pretend that you are a student. Run your assignment prompts through chatGPT. What are the results? Can chatGPT quickly complete the activity? 36 Can you redesign your assignment so that chatGPT cannot provide meaningful answers? Consider using references that students can only find in your class.

Save the results of your assignment experiments with chatGPT because chatGPT often provides similar answers for the same or similar questions or prompts. Before you turn your assignment loose to your students, show them what you have done and the lessons you have learned.

Assignment Design

Remember that most AI tools have built their data stores with content freely available on the internet.37 ChatGPT would not have access to proprietary academic databases. Additionally, chatGPT does not have access to current events. Another point to consider is that chatGPT is a textual interface. It cannot “see” images or hear audio files. The more friction you introduce into the assignment, the less appealing it will be to use AI. It requires effort to write a prompt for chatGPT. The more work it needs, the fewer students will do it. Here are some ways you could craft assignments to minimize the use of AI.

Create Phased Assignments. Rather than submit one final paper, have students build the assignment in parts, such as submitting a paper topic, annotated bibliography, outline, etc., until they complete the final paper.

Require Restricted References. Require students to use current materials from library databases. ChatGPT notes its references are a couple of years behind the current year. Additionally, ensure that students cite their work. Sample submitted citations to ensure they align with what students present in their papers.

Personal References. In your assignments, have students reflect on their experiences and share personal examples of applying concepts.

Reference Multimedia. Make references to multimedia resources that you have used in class. ChatGPT would not be able to make the connection. Creating an appropriate prompt could be too burdensome.

Assign Multimedia Projects. Rather than assign an essay or report, have students create a multimedia project. A multimedia project could be a presentation, podcast, video, magazine, ebook, etc.

Emphasize the Importance of Editing and Rewriting. Drafting a paper is only the first part of a writing assignment. Increase the opportunities for submitting drafts, conducting peer reviews, and incorporating feedback into the drafts before issuing a final grade. Have students explain their writing process and how they improved their writing through editing.38

Conduct In-class Writing Assignments. Have students work on phased aspects of their writing projects in class. Walk around to watch and discuss how students are working through the process.39

# Flip Your Classroom

You can use a flipped classroom approach for your instruction. Have students watch video lectures, read online content, or work through interactive tutorials outside of the class as “homework.” Students then work on typical homework assignments in class. Teachers can use the class session for activities requiring teacher interaction, such as question-and-answer sessions, problem-solving, and group discussions. Students would complete these types of activities without AI.

# Conclusion

I am not sure why you picked up this book, but I am glad you did. You may be looking for ideas on how to use chatGPT in your classroom. In that case, I hope it inspired you to propel your class forward. Or you may be looking for ways to shield students from artificial intelligence. But I hope that is not the case. Artificial intelligence is here to stay. Over the years, you will see its use increase in importance and frequency. We should take advantage of AI to make the world better. Computers are a force multiplier that can help us do work quickly so we can focus our attention on more pressing issues.

Throughout history, some educators have bristled at the introduction of new technologies and their impact on teaching and learning. For example, Plato spoke of the effect of writing in Phaedrus, “Enough of the art of speaking; let us now proceed to consider the true use of writing. There is an old Egyptian tale of Theuth, the inventor of writing, showing his invention to the god Thamus, who told him that he would only spoil men’s memories and take away their understandings.” Likewise, there has been criticism and angst over each new technology and its impact on education. Search, and you will find complaints regarding the introduction of computers, the internet, the

digitization of libraries, etc. Artificial intelligence will change teaching and learning, as have all the previous technologies. However, our role as educators is to prepare students for the future.   
Please give chatGPT a test drive. I am confident you will be fascinated with what you discover. However, remember that it is an emerging technology that has not yet been perfected. Each iteration will become better. Also, note that chatGPT is free as I write this book, but that may not always be the case. Finally, if you found this book informative, please share it with others and leave a review with your favorite bookseller. Thank you.

# Acknowledgments

I want to thank the Dean College faculty for starting the conversation and giving me the idea to write this book.   
All of my writing projects are better, thanks to the wonderful work of Bernadette van der Vliet, my wife and partner. She not only took time to proofread the book and offer meaningful suggestions but also created a beautiful cover and marketing images. She continues to make me look good. I can’t thank her enough.   
I would also like to thank my writing partner, chatGPT. ChatGPT tirelessly answered all my questions. This book is better because of this partnership.
