This project investigated the effects of training for peer response in university freshman composition classes over the course of one 15-week semester. Eight sections of composition (total $n = 1 6 9 ,$ participated. Students in the experimental group, composed of four sections, were trained via teacher-student conferences in which the teacher met students in groups of three to develop and practice strategies for peer response. Students in the control group, also four sections, received no systematic training aside from viewing a video example. The experimental and the control groups were compared with respect to the quantity and quality of feedback generated on peer writing as well as student interaction during peer response sessions. Analyses of data indicated that training students for peer response led to significantly more and significantly better-quality peer feedback and livelier discussion in the experimental group.

# Effects of Training for Peer Response on Students' Comments and Interaction

Wei Zhu University of Texas-Pan American

Peer response groups in which students work together to provide feedback on one another's writing have become a common feature of writing instruction at the college level throughout the United States.

According to DiPardo and Freedman (1988), widespread use of peer response groups, a relatively old pedagogical technique (Gere, 1987), has often been associated with what Hairston (1982) referred to as the "paradigm shift" toward process-oriented writing instruction. It is hoped that by allowing peers to intervene in one another's writing process via peer feedback, peer response groups will help students revise and eventually improve their writing.

More recently, strong support for peer response groups has come from theories that emphasize the social nature of learning, language, thought, and writing. The Vygotskyan (1962, 1978) perspective on learning and language lends particularly strong support for the use of peer response groups, which allow student interaction and negotiation of meaning to take place during the writing process. For Vygotsky (1978), learning is not an individual, secluded activity, but rather a cognitive activity that occurs in, and is mediated by, social interaction; therefore, social interaction is essential to learning. Vygotsky (1962) also underscored the vital role of language in thought development and the social origins of language and thought, arguing that "the true direction of the development of thinking is not from the individual to the social, but from the social to the individual" (p. 20). Rhetorical theories that emphasize the social nature of writing (Berlin, 1987; Bruffee, 1984, 1993; Harris, 1989) have also supported the use of peer response groups. Bruffee has argued that writing emerges from the "conversation" among writers in the writing community and that, therefore, it is crucial to provide students with opportunities to engage in constructive conversation about writing. Extending the Vygotskyan (1962) perspective on thought and language, Bruffee (1984) has argued that there is a close relationship between thought, writing and talk: Thought is "internalized public and social talk," and writing is "internalized social talk made public and social again" (p. 641). Thus, on the theoretical level, peer interaction is vital to writing development because it allows students to construct meaning within the context of social interaction (Forman & Cazden, 1985).

Various claims have been made about the cognitive and social benefits of peer response groups (Beaven, 1977; Hafernik, 1984; Hawkins, 1976; Herrington & Cadman, 1991; Mittan, 1989), including: (a) Peer response groups allow students to check their perception of reality and to strengthen their interpersonal skills; and (b) peer response groups help students improve their writing by providing a stronger motivation for revision and by encouraging students to develop an audience awareness sensitized by feedback from multiple perspectives. Yet, research suggests that peer response is not always as effective as it is claimed to be, and that in order for students to benefit fully, they need to be trained for peer response tasks.

Although peer response is sometimes found to enhance college student writing (Nystrand, 1986; Nystrand & Brandt, 1989), research has revealed that some difficulties must be addressed in classrooms employing peer response groups. One such difficulty is students' lack of knowledge and skills needed for peer response. Studies examining students' talk and comments in groups and their attitudes toward peer response in college classrooms have revealed that, because of a lack of knowledge about writing and peer response techniques, some students do not respond to peer writing critically and, therefore, do not provide peers with useful feedback (Flynn, 1982; George, 1984; Mangelsdorf, 1992; Newkirk, 1984; Rothstein-Vandergriff & Gilson, 1988). For example, Newkirk (1984) found that the ten college student readers in his study were willing to "read in" details and were not aware of the conventions governing the use of certain rhetorical devices. Flynn (1982) found that the ten college freshman participants in her study did not read their peers' writing critically enough and were too accepting of unfocused or incoherent essays. Her student readers did not always offer adequate feedback. RothsteinVandergriff and Gilson (1988) found that peer response in the two college freshman composition classes they examined often focused on sentence-level errors rather than on content. They did not approach their peers' writing critically and consequently failed to provide meaningful feedback.

These and other difficulties have triggered discussions concerning how peer response can be made more effective. Some researchers. have argued for more teacher assistance (Flynn, 1982; George, 1984; Wiener, 1986), particularly for the need to prepare students for peer response tasks. So far, only a few research studies have investigated the effects of teacher directions and assistance; nevertheless, results suggest that teacher assistance plays an important role in enhancing the success of peer response groups.

Sommers and Lawrence (1992) conducted a study that examined the effects of teacher direction on women's talk in peer response groups. They analyzed peer interactions in eight mixed-gender peer groups (average group size was three): four teacher-directed and four student-directed. In teacher-directed groups, students were given specific guidelines and procedures.for conducting peer group sessions. The student-directed groups were not given any guidelines and were told, instead, to devise their own procedures for working in groups. Comments from the two types of groups were analyzed qualitatively, and obvious gender-related differences were found. Although male and female students in teacher-directed groups participated almost equally in discussions, female students talked less and were interrupted more in student-directed groups. Lower overall response levels and a presence of dominant voices were also characteristic of student-directed groups.

There is also evidence that coaching students for peer response improves students' ability to comment on peer writing. Stanley (1992) found that coaching English as a second language (ESL) students for peer response through extensive discussion of writing and peer response procedures had positive effects: The 15 college ESL students who received 7 hours of preparation engaged more in the tasks and provided a larger amount of and more specific feedback on peer writing than the 19 students who received 1 hour of training via demonstration. Stanley concluded that coaching students for peer response improved both the quality and quantity of peer feedback.

Research on cooperative learning, of which collaborative peer response groups are considered a specific type (Sommers & Lawrence, 1992), also strongly suggests the need to train students for peer group tasks. The positive effects of cooperative learning on students' academic achievement and literacy and language development have been documented in numerous books and articles (e.g., Bejarano, 1987; Fathman & Kessler, 1993; Gunderson & Johnson, 1980; Johnson & Johnson, 1989; Kagan, 1986; Long & Porter, 1985; McGroarty, 1989, 1991; O'Donnell, Dansereau, Rocklin, Lambiotee, Hythecker, & Larson, 1985; O'Donnell, Dansereau, Rocklin, Larson, Hythecker, Young, & Lambiotte, 1987; Pica & Doughty, 1985; Sharan & Shachar, 1988; Slavin, 1990; Slavin & Oickle, 1981; Stevens, Madden, Slavin, & Farnish, 1987). Yet, researchers have emphasized that in order for cooperative learning to be effective, students must be prepared; merely placing students into groups does not ensure learning (Slavin, 1989). Teachers should help students acquire both the cognitive and cooperative skills needed for group work by providing instruction and feedback before and during cooperative activities (McGroarty, 1989; Meloth & Deering, 1990; Palincsar & David, 1991).

Therefore, an essential issue in using peer response groups involves assisting students to develop skills and strategies needed for interaction during peer response sessions. Composition research that has examined characteristics of successful and dysfunctional peer response groups (George, 1984; Spear, 1988) has pointed out areas that may be focused on when training students. Overall, successful peer response groups are task oriented, focus on the global features of writing, provide accurate and specific feedback for one another, and engage in negotiation. In contrast, dysfunctional groups either rarely follow directions or perform tasks rather superficially. These features suggest that training for peer response may focus on assisting students to respond to the global features in peer writing critically, to provide specific feedback, and to negotiate meaning.

This article reports a study designed to investigate the effects of training for peer response on college freshman students' ability to comment on peer writing. Specifically, the study compared students who received training for peer response with those who received no systematic training. Four research questions addressed in this study were:

1. Do students who receive training on peer response provide a greater amount of feedback on peer writing than those who receive no training?   
2. Do students who receive training on peer response provide a greater amount of feedback on the global features of peer writing (i.e., content, organization, audience, purpose, etc.) than those who receive no training?   
3. Do students who receive training on peer response provide a greater amount of relevant and specific feedback on peer writing than those who receive no training?   
4. Do students who receive training on peer response engage in more active interaction and negotiation when critiquing peer writing than Students who receive no training?

In the following sections, I will first describe the research design, the training procedures involved, and the methods of analyses. Then, I will present results and discuss their implications.

# METHOD

# The Institution

Northern Arizona University (NAU) is a comprehensive, mediumsized, 4-year public university. Students attending this university come from varied cultural and ethnic backgrounds; most are Anglo $( 8 0 . 6 \% )$ , with $8 . 3 \%$ Hispanic and ${ 5 . 6 \% }$ American Indian students. At the time of the study, the university had 399 international students representing 60 countries and regions (NAl Fact Book, 1993).

All undergraduate students attending NAU are required to take Freshman Composition. The goal of the Freshman Composition Program at NAU is similar to that of many composition programs in the United States: to assist students in developing critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Classroom instruction in English 101 (Freshman Composition, first semester) focuses on both reading and writing, with considerable emphasis placed on the writing process. For the Fall 1993 semester during which the study took place, six papers, two in-class and four out-of-class, were required of students enrolled in English 101. At least one draft was required of each out-of-class paper, and peer response was used as an integral part of writing instruction.

# The Participants

Participants in this study were students enrolled in eight sections of English 101 and four instructors teaching these classes.

# The Students

One hundred sixty-nine students, 69 male and 100 female, volunteered to participate in this study because their instructors had also agreed to participate. Most students were traditional freshmen, although a. few were older. One hundred forty-four students were native speakers of English; the remaining 25 were, variably, native speakers of Spanish, American Indian languages, and a few other languages.

According to self-report data, more than half of the students had had some experience with peer response prior to taking English 101 at NAU. Approximately $45 \%$ of all students had had at least one class in which peer response groups were used. Another $1 0 \%$ of the students had had at least five courses of which peer response was a part. A few students said they had had as many as ten classes in which they worked in peer response groups.

# The Instructors

The four instructors, three male and one female, who participated in this study were all graduate teaching assistants. Each instructor taught two sections of English 101. While completing their teaching assignments, the four instructors were actively engaged in graduate studies in their respective fields: rhetoric, creative writing, and TESL/applied linguistics. All instructors had had some teaching experience before the study started. The selection of these four instructors was primarily based on their willingness to participate.

# Design of the Study

This study involved a matched-pair, nonrandomized controlgroup design. The eight sections of English 101 that participated in the study were divided into two large groups, the experimental group (four classes) and the control group (four classes). Each participating instructor taught one class in the experimental group and one in the control group; for each instructor, the assignment of one class to the experimental group and the other to the control group was made randomly. The experimental and control groups were similar in terms of their experience with peer response prior to the study.

Both groups received a pretest to assess their writing skills at the beginning of the semester.' Then, both groups were introduced to peer response by viewing a 28-minute demonstration video (Wordshop Productions, Inc., 1991). In the video, four students from diverse cultural backgrounds provided feedback on one another's writing. The writers read their drafts twice while group members wrote down brief comments. Then, peer group members took turns commenting on the papers. In all participating classes, viewing the video was followed by some discussion of the purpose of peer response and of the video.

Students in the experimental group were specifically trained for peer response.. Teachers used a conference method in which each teacher met students in groups of three to discuss strategies for providing effective feedback on peer writing three times during the semester. Students in the control group received no further training beyond the initial video demonstration and discussion. Both groups conducted peer response on the first draft of the last three take-home assignments. Subsequently, the experimental and control groups were compared with respect to the quantity and quality of feedback generated and their interaction during peer response sessions.

Throughout the semester, instructors gave their two classes the same writing instruction except for training on peer response. The researcher observed all participating classes at least five times to ensure that any two classes taught by the same instructor indeed received the same instruction.

# Rationale for Teacher-Student Group Conferences

The conference method was chosen primarily because of its pedagogical advantages (Carnicelli, 1980; Fassler, 1978; Freedman, 1980; Harris, 1987, 1990), particularly because it enables teachers to interact with students and to provide more individualized instruction, and because it allows students to express their concerns, making it possible for the teacher to check the comprehensibility of their feedback and instruction. It was hoped that, when used to coach students for peer response, conferencing would allow the teachers to discern students' difficulties more readily and to tailor training to suit the needs of different students.

The conference method was also chosen because it provides an arena for writing teachers to use simultaneously the two general means of assistance discussed by Scardamalia and Bereiter (1985). First, conferencing allows direct strategy instruction, which involves explication of the principles or modeling of the strategies to be learned. In training conferences, an instructor can easily explain the rationale for peer response and model response strategies. Second, conferencing makes it possible for the instructor to provide both "substantive" and "procedural" facilitation. According to Scardamalia and Bereiter (1985), substantive facilitation involves the teacher as a collaborator responding to students' performance of a task. Procedural facilitation involves providing external support to reduce students' "executive burden" so that they can carry out a complex task more successfully. In training conferences, the teacher can provide substantive facilitation by collaborating with students on simulated peer response tasks and responding to students' performance of these tasks. The teacher can provide procedural facilitation by directing students' attention to procedural decisions through use of various oral prompts.

Training conferences in this study were group conferences, each involving one instructor and three students. The presence of three students in a conference was a deliberate choice because it allowed the training to occur in a situation resembling that of peer response sessions, in which multiple students are typically involved. The group conference also made it possible for the instructors to encourage and guide interaction among students, thus enabling the teachers to foster the kind of interaction characteristic of successful peer response groups. It was hoped that by situating training in contexts similar to those of peer response sessions, skills and strategies that students developed through the training conferences could be more readily transferred to the ensuing classroom sessions.

# Procedure

# Instructor Training

Most of the training took place in a single session during the third week of instruction of the Fall 1993 semester, although considerable informal training was provided both before and after the training session itself. The formal training session, attended by all four instructors, was held after a 2-hour pilot session was conducted 2 weeks earlier. This formal training session, about 2 hours in length, was divided into three phases. During the first phase, the researcher presented background and rationale for the research project. The second phase focused on the group conference itself. During this phase, it was emphasized that the conference was designed to train students for peer response, not simply to provide feedback on students' writing. To illustrate training for peer response in teacherstudent conferences, one transcript of an individual conference in which an instructor was coaching a student for peer response was analyzed in detail, with particular attention to the following features: (a) teacher and student interaction (i.e., how the teacher constantly prompted the student to take the initiative and never dominated the conference), (b) the teacher's focus on the global features of writing when guiding the student, (c) the teacher's efforts and techniques to help the student make specific comments and suggestions, and (d) teacher modeling and instruction.? Discussion was then undertaken on methods and techniques that could be used to address the special needs of the group conferences. Issues such as conference length and conference activities were also discussed. The last phase of the training session was devoted to questions from the instructors and to discussion of peer group sessions.

Informal instructor training continued after the formal session described above to enhance training already provided. In the week following the training session, all four instructors were invited to an informal session in which the researcher and the instructors discussed again the research design, the key components of the training conferences, and questions instructors formed after the training session, most of which centered on classroom procedures involved in the study. Discussion about the group conferences also took place after each round of teacher-student conferences. For each round, the researcher observed and tape recorded at least half of each instructor's conferences and arranged informal meetings with the instructors. In the post-conference meetings (typically 25 to 45 minutes in length), the researcher and the instructors discussed the conferences, focusing on improvements that could be made in the next round of conferencing. Time was also spent on questions that the instructors had about the project.

# Teacher-Student Conferences

Teacher-student conferences were held prior to peer critique of students' initial drafts of the last three take-home assignments for the semester. Students attended the conferences in groups of three; for each conference, one student volunteered to bring writing to be critiqued. The papers volunteered, however, were those that students had already completed earlier in the semester or for other courses, not drafts that students were working on at the time of the conference. This was done to ensure that no student would receive teacher feedback on the first draft prior to peer response sessions when data were collected. Generally speaking, students volunteered expository essays similar to those they were working on at the time of conferencing. For each assignment, one regular class period was canceled to schedule the conferences. Instructors also used time outside class.

The training conferences ranged from 15 to about 25 minutes in length. Mostly, students were free to select their own groups to attend the conferences. When instructors assigned conference groups, assignment was made randomly or simply to ensure that groups included both male and female students.

The teacher-student conferences typically consisted of two parts. In the first part, the student who had volunteered to bring writing read the essay out loud while the teacher and peers followed along with copies of the essay and wrote down brief comments. In the second part, the instructor and the students discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the essay and provided suggestions for revision. The instructors almost always let the students express their opinions first, often opening the discussion with the question "So, what do you think?" In this part, instructors focused on assisting students to respond critically to peer writing and to provide specific feedback. Teachers made it clear that, when critiquing peer writing, peers should focus more on global concerns such as development of ideas, audience, purpose, and organization. Often, the teachers explicitly asked students to comment first on aspects related to the content and organization of the essay under discussion. When some students failed to do this and instead first commented on more local features such as grammar, language usage, and word choice, the teacher would briefly discuss students' feedback but would then guide students' attention back to the global concerns, using directives such as "Grammar is important, but let's look at the big picture first."

Because a primary goal was to help students generate specific feedback, teachers often asked students to clarify and/or to specify their comments and suggestions. For example, if a student provided a general comment that the paper was confusing, the teacher would ask that student to explain what was confusing. Where necessary, the teacher would model how specific comments could be made. For instance, to show students how to make a general suggestion such as "use more examples" more specific, one teacher said to a student "You could tell X that some examples should be used in the second paragraph to substantiate that statement." Questions such as "How can we make this more specific?" were frequently used by the teachers to convey to students the need for providing specific feedback. Because negotiation among students is deemed vital to the success of peer response, the instructors encouraged interaction between the writer and readers and among all group members. Instructors underscored the importance of asking questions and seeking and providing clarifications. Instructors also pointed out the important role played by the writer during peer response sessions and modeled strategies writers could use to elicit peer feedback.

In the conferences, teachers provided substantive facilitation by collaborating with students on peer response tasks and responding to their performance on those tasks. Instructors provided procedural facilitation through use of questions that directed students' attention to those aspects of writing students needed to focus on during peer response (e.g., "What is the main point here?" and "Does everything in the paper relate to the main point?"). Where relevant, instructors also provided some writing instruction, mostly centered on more global concerns. In one conference, for example, an instructor and three students were discussing an essay on individualism. The student writer had crammed a number of different ideas into one paragraph, which caused some difficulty for the readers. Because peer responders failed to see what the problem really was, the instructor gave the group some instruction on paragraph development. Also, the instructors provided relevant instruction on the purpose of peer response. Some groups, especially during the early rounds of conferences, did not feel comfortable commenting on peer writing and frankly admitted that they did not want to hurt the feelings of peer writers. When this occurred, instructors would reiterate that the purpose of peer response was to help, rather than to criticize, the writer.

Whereas the experimental group was trained for peer response via small teacher-student group conferences, the control group either had regular classes or individual conferences with the instructors. In the individual conferences, however, the instructors and students did not discuss students' evolving drafts. As with the experimental group, teacher feedback was not available prior to peer critique of students' initial drafts.

# Students' Peer Response Sessions

Peer response on students' initial drafts was conducted for the last three take-home assignments in both experimental and control classes. Students worked in groups of three, although occasionally pairs or groups of four were formed to adjust for the number of students present in class. In classes taught by two instructors, peer groups were formed early in the semester and stayed together for the entire semester. The other two instructors gave students opportunities to form new groups each time peer response was conducted, although students did not have to change groups if they did not want to. Three instructors devoted entire class periods (75 minutes) to peer response in their classes. The other instructor consistently spent 40 to 45 minutes on peer response in his classes.

Procedures followed during peer response were the same in all classes. Students were asked to bring copies of their drafts for group members and were given the same instructions: to provide one another with specific comments and suggestions and to engage in a negotiation of meaning. In each peer response group, the writer first read the paper while others followed along with copies of the draft. Then, students responded to the paper. All group discussions were tape-recorded. Students were provided with response sheets (Appendix A) to give one another written comments but were also encouraged to comment on the draft itself, including making necessary corrections. At the end of the peer response sessions, students were instructed to revise their writing and turn in their second drafts for teacher feedback.

The instructors did not participate in peer group discussions. Their role was primarily to facilitate peer response by ensuring that students understood the procedures involved.

# Data Analyzed

Data analyzed consisted of (a) written peer feedback on the last two out-of-class assignments students wrote (hereafter referred to as Assignment 1 and Assignment 2), (b) students' initial drafts of these assignments, and (c) tape recordings of student discussion during peer response sessions.3

# Instrumentation

Three instruments were developed specifically for use in this study, including (a) a coding scheme for students' written comments, (b) a rating scale for students' written comments, and (c) a holistic grading system.

# Coding Scheme for Students' Written Comments

This coding scheme (Appendix B) consisted of adaptations of Elbow's (1981) catalog of criterion-based feedback on peer writing. The adapted scheme categorized student feedback as global, local, or evaluative. Global feedback addressed concerns such as development of ideas, audience and purpose, and organization of writing. Local feedback addressed concerns such as wording, grammar, and punctuation. Evaluative feedback expressed students' overall evaluation of peer writing. Appendix C includes sample comments in the three coding categories.

The researcher and an experienced writing instructor independently coded $1 1 \%$ of students' written comments $( n = 2 0 1 )$ , and agreement was achieved on $9 8 \%$ of the comments coded. With satisfactory inter-coder reliability obtained, the researcher coded all remaining comments.

# Rating Scale for Students' Written Comments

This scale (Appendix D) was used to evaluate student feedback on peer writing. All peer feedback was rated on a 3-point scale, where ${ \mathfrak { z } } =$ comments specific and relevant; ${ \mathfrak { 2 } } =$ comments relevant but general; and ${ \mathfrak { 1 } } =$ comments irrelevant or inaccurate. Relevancy of peer feedback was established in the context of the drafts on which the feedback was provided. Appendix E contains sample comments in the three rating categories.

The same two readers rated 190 comments to assess reliability of the rating scale.' Perfect agreement was achieved on $9 7 \%$ of the comments rated. With satisfactory inter-rater reliability obtained, the researcher rated all remaining comments.

# Composition Scoring Scale

A holistic scoring system (Appendix F) was used to assess the quality of student writing on the pretest. The grading scale consisted of a slight modification of the holistic grading criteria used for Freshman Composition at the University of Arizona (Gilles & Snook, 1990). The holistic scoring scale in this study evaluated student writing on a 5-point scale, with 5 being highest. Two experienced composition instructors familiar with holistic scoring served as readers. All papers were independently scored, and inter-rater reliability was .88 as measured by Pearson product-moment correlation.

# Hypotheses and Definitions

This study investigated four questions regarding whether students who received training on peer response would (a) provide a greater amount of feedback on peer writing, (b) provide a greater amount of feedback on global features in peer writing, (c) provide a greater amount of relevant and specific feedback, and (d) engage in more active interaction. It was hypothesized that they would do so.

In this study, "feedback" or "comments" referred to remarks, suggestions, questions, and corrections that students provided on one another's writing for the purpose of revision. "The amount of feedback" was operationalized as the average number of remarks, questions, suggestions, and corrections that students received from all peer group responders. "Amount of feedback on global features" was operationalized as the average number of remarks, suggestions, and questions on global features that students received from all peer group members. "The amount of relevant, specific feedback" was operationalized as the average number of remarks, suggestions, questions, and corrections in the $\prime \prime 3 \prime \prime$ rating category that students received from all peer group responders. "Active interaction" was operationalized as relatively equal participation by group members in extended discussion of peer writing and their negotiation of meaning through requesting and providing information.

# Methods of Analysis

Both quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis were employed. To investigate the three research questions regarding peer feedback, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOvA) was used. Two MANOVA analyses were performed, each using data from one of the two assignments. Only complete data sets were used (i.e., peer comments received along with the initial drafts). Level of significance for the MANOVA was set at .05.

In addition, a t test was conducted on students' holistic scores on the prewriting assignment to determine whether there were significant differences between the experimental and control groups with respect to writing ability prior to the study.

For qualitative analysis, one group discussion of a peer paper was selected from each class for each assignment $( n = 1 6 )$ . Mostly, the eight discussions selected from the experimental group matched those from the control group on number and gender of participants. Discussions in the two groups were compared qualitatively with respect to the overall interaction pattern, students' turn-taking behaviors (whether students in the groups all actively took turns in the discussion), students' efforts to negotiate meaning through requesting and providing information, and the role of the writer during peer response.

# RESULTS

# Quantitative Analyses

# Pretest

No significant difference was found between the experimental and control groups on the pretest $( t = . 2 6 , p > . 0 5 ,$ d $f = 1 4 3$ .6

# Analyses of Written Comments

Results of statistical analyses supported the hypotheses that the experimental group would provide (a) a greater amount of feedback, (b) a greater amount of feedback on global features of peer writing, and (c) a greater amount of relevant and specific feedback.

# Analysis 1

This analysis used 91 data sets, 45 experimental and 46 control, comprising students' comments on and initial drafts of Assignment 1. An examination of the descriptive statistics revealed that the experimental group had higher means than the control group on the Amount of Feedback variable $\mathrm { \Delta } M = 7 . 3 7 .$ $S D = 2 . 8 6$ vs. $M = 4 . 2 2$ $s D =$ 1.49), the Amount of Global Feedback variable $( M = 5 . 0 4 ,$ $S D = 1 . 5 4$ vs. $\pmb { M } = 3 . 2 1$ $S D = 1 . 2 8 )$ , and the Amount of Specific Feedback variable $( M = 4 . 1 2$ $S D = 2 . 3 0$ vs. $M = 1 . 0 2 ,$ $S D = . 8 0 _ { . } ^ { \cdot }$

Table 1 displays results of the MANOVA analysis using students' comments on Assignment 1. As shown in the table, multivariate $F$ was significant (Pillai's criterion $\mathbf { \delta } = . 5 1 \mathbf { \delta }$ $p < . 0 5 )$ , suggesting significant differences between the experimental and control groups on a linear combination of dependent variables on students' comments. As recommended by Tabachnick and Fidell (1989), the more conservative Pillai's criterion was used instead of Wilks's lambda to evaluate multivariate significance because the assumption of homogeneity

Because the multivariate $F$ ratio revealed a significant multivariate effect of treatment, univariate ANOVAs were conducted to determine which dependent variables were affected. Table 2 summarizes the results of univariate ANOVAs. Level of significance for the ANOVAs was set at .01 to adjust for inflated type 1 error due to multiple comparisons. As shown in Table 2, significant differences were found on all three variables.

# Analysis 2

This analysis used 87 data sets, 44 experimental and 43 control, comprising students' comments on and initial drafts of Assignment 2. A comparison of descriptive statistics revealed that the experimental group again had higher means than the control group on the Amount of Feedback variable ( $\begin{array} { r } { M = 6 . 6 6 , } \end{array}$ $S D = 2 . 9 6$ vs. $M = 4 . 6 5$ $S D = 2 . 0 9 \mathrm { \Omega }$ , the Amount of Global Feedback variable $( M = 4 . 5 3$ $S D = 1 . 7 3$ vs. $M = 2 . 8 3 ,$ $S D = 1 . 6 6 ) $ , and the Amount of Specific Feedback variable $( M = 3 . 1 7 ,$ $S D = 2 . 1 8$ vs. $M = 1 . 5 6$ $S D = 1 . 5 5 \rangle$

Table 3 displays results of the MANOVA analysis using students' comments on Assignment 2. As shown in the table, multivariate $F$ was significant at the preset level (Wilks's lambda $= . 7 2 , p < . 0 5 )$ , suggesting significant differences between the experimental and control groups on a linear combination of the dependent variables.

Univariate ANOVAs were subsequently performed to examine which variables were affected by treatment. Table 4 displays results of the univariate ANOVAs. Again, level of significance for the ANOVAs was set at .01 to adjust for type 1 error due to multiple comparisons. As shown in Table 4, significant differences were found on all three variables.

Thus, results of the two MANOVA analyses of students' comments revealed the same pattern: The experimental group provided significantly more feedback, significantly more feedback on global features of writing, and significantly more specific and relevant feedback.

# Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative analysis of student discussions indicated that although there was some variation within the experimental and control groups, there was considerably less interaction in the control group overall. Two different overall interaction patterns were observed: the "reader reporting" pattern and the "reader-writer sharing" pattern. In the "reader-reporting" pattern characteristic of discussions from the control group, responders took long turns reporting their feedback to the writer, and there was little negotiation of feedback between the writer and the readers. This pattern is exemplified in the following transcript of a discussion in which three students were collaborating on a comparison/contrast paper on whether records of victims should be released. For this assignment, students were asked to compare and contrast two articles on the same topic.

Student A: Okay, I'll talk about what I put down. $\mathrm { U m } ,$ you are with your strength in this paper. Okay, you are very descriptive and you had a lot of good points. And the articles are good attention-catchers. I like that. Um, the weaknesses of the paper, you need to compare and contrast more, cause you know, um, it seems like a personal opinion paper. And um, just like contents of the articles, compare the two. And the question I have is how the two different articles are like and different, like how they compare to each other, like how they are the same and how they are different.

Writer: Okay.

Student A: And like suggestions for revision, compare the two a little more. Give some more similarities and differences. That's about it.

Writer: Okay.

Student B: Um, you had a really strong argument, but you know, for one side. But you had really good examples of the problem. But you didn't really quite make it clear what your view is, whether the record should be released or not. You know, um, again, what is your view? And the example about the little boy who was sexually abused, you should try to find another example, or another story of a kid whose name was released and that hurt and damaged too.

Student A: A different article, like the other article, and maybe there is something in there.

Writer: Yeah. I see.

Student B: Other than that, it's a good paper.

Writer: Okay.

Quite obviously, the entire discussion was dominated by the readers. In this discussion, each responder took a long turn (the first turns by Student A and Student B, respectively) when commenting on the paper, and these two turns dominated the entire discussion. Although students in this group took a comparable number of turns (three by

Student $\mathbf { A } ,$ two by Student B, and four by the writer), seemingly suggesting rather equal participation by all members, the writer did not actually take part in the discussion; all of his comments were instances of back-channeling. There was no real negotiation of meaning through efforts to seek and provide clarification of meaning. Writers did not probe or question responses, even when reader comments were somewhat vague (e.g., "Compare the two a little more," Student A).

Although most of the peer group discussions sampled from the control group featured little interaction and negotiation, discussions from two groups represented more of a "reader-writer sharing" pattern. In these discussions, both readers and the writer participated in negotiating meaning. In the following excerpt of such a discussion, three students were discussing a paper on curfew.

Student A: Yours is good. Yours is like, I was reading it, it sounded like it's a [unintelligible] paper. Is it what you wanted it to be?   
Writer: Yeah, cause I couldn't decide which side I wanted.   
Student A: Yeah.   
Writer: I mean, I don't, I kind of want it and I don't want it. Have you had something you just couldn't decide on? That's why I just.--   
Student A: Yeah. Are you going to make it longer or this is it?   
Writer: Yeah, I'll make it longer.   
Student A: Okay.   
Student B: How long is it supposed to be?   
Student A: Three to five pages.   
Writer: Was there like seriously any problems?   
Student A: $\mathrm { O h , }$ no. It was really good. I mean, I didn't get your opinion at all.   
Student B: Yeah.   
Writer: Really? Not even at the end?   
Student B: You just said you don't have it or something.   
Student A: Right.   
Writer: Maybe I should put a little more opinion in there.   
Student A: Yeah, definitely. Put some opinion in there. I mean I'd like to see your opinion at the very beginning. Either say you like or dislike it.

# [Discussion continued.]

In this excerpt, all students participated in the discussion; nobody dominated the discussion, as indicated by the relatively equal distribution of turns among group members. The long turns characteristic of the "reader reporting" pattern were not present. Interaction and negotiation were evident from questions and ensuing responses students used to request and provide information and clarifications for one another. For example, in the beginning of the excerpt, Student A asked a question that gave the writer a chance to check her intention and to gauge reader impression ("Is it what you wanted it to be?"). In response to the question, the writer made clear her intention and identified a potential problem ("I kind of like it and I don't like it"). Note that in this discussion the writer played a quite active role to invite feedback by asking questions (e.g., "Was there seriously any problems?"). In response to the writer's invitation for comments, Student A identified a potential weakness--the writer did not state her opinion--and provided a suggestion for revision ("I'd like to see your opinion at the very beginning"). Discussions such as this, however, were rather rare in the control group.

With one exception, discussions sampled from the experimental group demonstrated the "reader-writer sharing" pattern. Neither readers nor the writer dominated these discussions, and students engaged in negotiation of meaning. The writer often played an active role in the interaction. The following is an excerpt in which three students were discussing a paper on second-hand smoke. In this episode, discussion centered on the content of the essay, a global concern of writing.' Each participant's turn was numbered to assist presentation of the analysis.

[Discussion started; seven turns elapsed.]

Student A: What you have is really good. But you need so much more.(1)   
Writer: Like?(1)   
Student B: I don't know. $\mathrm { O h } ,$ I don't see anything wrong---(1)   
Student A: There is a lot you can put down.(2)   
Student B: I don't know what's that.(2)   
Writer: Well, give me some clues, X [Student A's name]. What else can I talk about?(2)   
Student A: That's what I was trying to figure out. I need to think about it.(3)   
Writer: At least you got some ideas. [To Student B] Do you have something to say?(3)   
[episode interrupted; 14 turns elapsed]   
Student A: You can talk about, write a paragraph on, there is like planes now that are just for smokers, you know.(4)   
Student B: There are planes?(3)   
Student A: There are planes now just for smokers.(5)   
Writer: There is?(4)   
Student A: There is like [unintelligible]. Yeah.(6)   
Writer: Oh.(5)   
Student A: You can talk about that.(7)   
Writer: Like in a positive way or a negative way?(6)   
Student A: You can talk about them, well, people were kind of, people were doing, keeping smokers from doing it. It's like a freedom thing, you know.(8)   
Writer: Yeah.(7)   
Student A: And then you can talk about, then you can say like it's their freedom [unintelligible]. That's what it says in the Constitution. In the Constitution .. . (9)   
Writer: What's said?(8)   
Student A: In the Constitution, it says you have the right to do whatever you want as long as like it doesn't hurt someone else. If it infringes upon on their rights, then--(10)   
Student B: It's unconstitutional.(4)   
Student A: So, it's the same way with smoke. You can smoke, you know, if you want, as long as it doesn't do harm to someone else.(11)   
Writer: Good.(9)   
Student B: Okay, the only other thing, technical errors--(5)   
[episode interrupted again; 11 turns elapsed]   
Student A: You can talk about some cases where people have lost custody rights because of smoking.(12)   
Writer: Custody rights?(10)   
Student A: Yeah, this one lady---(13)   
Student B: You mean child custody?(6)   
Student A: Yeah. This one lady took her husband to court, you know, and he lost custody to the kids.(14)   
Writer: Because he smoked?(11)   
Student A: Because they found traces of nicotine and some other stuff. It was in the kids, it's like in their system.(15)   
Writer: It was in the kid's system?(12)   
Student A: Yeah, through second-hand smoke.(16)   
Student B: Oh, really?(7)   
Student A: Yeah.(17)   
Writer: I never heard about that before.(13)   
Student A: They found that [unintelligible]. I think it was in California. I don't know. You might want to find out where it was. Okay?(18)   
Writer: Okay.(14)

# [Discussion continued.]

Discussion in this episode was not dominated by any member; both the readers and the writer participated in the discussion, although Student A and the writer were obviously more engaged in the discussion as indicated by the number of turns students took (16 by Student A, 14 by the writer, and 7 by Student B).1 Again, the long turns taken by readers in the "reader reporting" pattern were not present. Students engaged in negotiation of feedback through questions and answers. One thing worth mentioning is that although negotiation was also observed in the "reader-writer sharing" pattern in two control groups, negotiation in the experimental groups as illustrated in the above excerpt was more extensive, more in-depth, characterized by extended exchange on a particular topic over interrupted as well as successive turns, suggesting livelier, richer discussion. In the above episode, 33 turns were devoted to the discussion of Student A's comment "What you have is really good. But you need so much more." Although interrupted twice (after the third turn by the writer and the fourth turn by Student B, respectively), discussion resumed and continued for a number of successive turns after each interruption. Note how this extended negotiation through questions and responses led the responder to give specific feedback. Initially, the reader simply said "You need so much more" (Student A, turn 1) and "You can talk about that" (Student A, turn 7), both of which were fairly general suggestions. But through negotiation of meaning with peers and particularly in response to the writer's questions "What else can I talk about?" (Writer, turn 2), and "Like in a positive way or anegative way?" (turn 6), the reader was able to provide much more specific suggestions (Student A, turns 8, 9, 11, and 12). In fact, the specific comments provided toward the end of the discussion could be seen as the product of the discourse jointly constructed by the readers and the writer.

In this episode, the writer played an active role, inviting feedback by using both directives (e.g., "Well, give me some clues," turn 2) and questions (e.g., turn 1 and turn 6). She also sought clarifications of meaning through use of questions (e.g., turn 8 and turn 10). The active role played by the writer was instrumental in sustaining the discussion.

Extended negotiation was also evident when students were discussing more local problems. In the following episode, two students were discussing the meaning of a sentence.

Reader: Um, okay. You say [reading from the essay] "second-hand smokes are also dangerous to people who have asthma, children and pregnant women."   
Writer: Um. .

Reader: Are you saying people who own pregnant women and who own children? Why would it be dangerous to people who have children? Are you saying it is dangerous . .

Writer: Oh, no.

Reader: Dangerous to people who have asthma and . .

Writer: Dangerous to people who have asthma, dangerous to children and dangerous to pregnant women.

Reader: Okay. I guess, what's that? Not parallel? Maybe? Cause it's saying it's dangerous----

Writer: How should I say it?

Reader: Um, say second-hand smoking is dangerous to people who have health conditions like asthma. It's also bad for children and pregnant women, like two separate sentences? Maybe?

Writer: Okay.

Reader: Because people who have children, it doesn't hurt them more just because they have the kids. It hurts the kids, but it doesn't hurt them specifically. That's kind of the way I understood it.

This episode took up 11 successive turns between the writer and the responder, beginning with the responder's reading of the problematic sentence and ending with the responder's explanation of her suggestion for revision. Note how the writer and the responder negotiated meaning through efforts to seek and provide clarification. The responder first asked questions that indicated reader confusion and checked writer intention ("Are you saying . . ."). In response to the reader's questions, the writer clarified her intended meaning, which helped the responder to identify the problem, a nonparallel sentence. Then, the writer used a question to invite feedback ("How should I say it?"). In response to the writer's invitation, the reader provided a specific suggestion (i.e., two separate sentences). The outcome of this negotiation was a specific suggestion for revision.

Using questions to elicit feedback was a common strategy writers in the experimental group employed. Another strategy writers often used was identifying specific problems in their writing and/or pointing out areas where help was needed. This strategy is evidenced in the following excerpt of a discussion in which three students were discussing a paper on computers.

Writer: This doesn't include the persuasion. Student A: This doesn't include the persuasion? Student B: Actually I think it does. Student A: It's a pretty good paper.

Writer: I mean I'm just going to have another paragraph about how a lot of people don't like how computers are doing, but not sure how to do it. That's all I'm worried about. Just about a paragraph or two.

[Discussion continued and readers provided suggestions.]

Here, the writer initiated the discussion by identifying a problem in his writing (the essay did not include persuasion) and proposed a suggestion for revision. Peers then offered their suggestions.

Although the readers and writers generally participated in peer discussion rather equally in the experimental group, a few responders did occasionally take fairly long turns when giving feedback. Nonetheless, these turns did not change the interactive nature of the discussions because there was negotiation before and/or after each responder had commented on peer writing.

Overall, students in the experimental group engaged in more active interaction and negotiation during peer response. Informal observations by all participating instructors and students' comments on the use of peer response groups in their classes also indicated that peer response was more effective in the experimental classes.11

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The results of this study indicate that training students for peer response via teacher-student conferences had a significant impact on both the quantity and quality of feedback students provided on peer writing. The emphasis on global concerns of writing and on specific feedback during training helped students provide more effective feedback on one another's writing. Given that students' ability to comment on global features of writing and to provide relevant and specific feedback is often found to be characteristic of successful peer response groups, it is reasonable to conclude that training students for peer response through small group conferences enhances the success of peer response. Thus, the findings of this study support arguments for coaching students for peer response tasks. The findings also corroborate results of other studies that have investigated the effects of preparing students for peer response (e.g., Stanley, 1992).

The results of the qualitative analysis of student discussions during peer response sessions indicated that although there was some variation within the experimental and control groups, overall, students in the experimental group engaged more in interaction and negotiation of meaning. Thus, the results of the qualitative analysis supplement those of the quantitative analyses, both pointing to more effective peer response in the experimental group. Specifically, the qualitative analysis revealed that students in the experimental group demonstrated those behaviors instructors helped them develop in the training conferences (e.g., to request and provide specific feedback through negotiation), suggesting that skills developed through training could be transferred to peer response sessions following training. Also, the analysis of student discussions indicated that negotiation is important and that college freshman students can benefit from meaningful negotiation with peers. There seemed to be a relationship between students' negotiation and the quality of peer feedback. When students negotiated meaning, peer feedback tended to be more specific. On the other hand, when there was no negotiation, as in the "reporting" sessions, feedback tended to be more general.

Results of this study reveal the positive effects of training students for peer response. But they also suggest that although peer response groups may provide students with opportunities to interact with one another, the act of working in groups on peer writing in and of itself does not guarantee that the kind of interaction and negotiation considered crucial to meaningful learning (Vygotsky, 1978) and often believed to underlie peer response (e.g., Bruffee, 1984, 1993) will take place. In this study, students in the control group were given the opportunity to interact with one another, yet meaningful negotiation within the context of social interaction did not take place in all of the control groups sampled. Therefore, we cannot assume that because students work in peer groups, they will automatically and invariably engage in and benefit from interaction and the negotiation of meaning.

Given the importance of interaction and negotiation in peer response, a major part of the teacher's duty when using peer response groups is to promote negotiation and interaction among students so that they can indeed enjoy the cognitive and social benefits of peer interaction. The results of this study suggest that participants' knowledge and skills affect peer interaction and that helping students to develop skills and strategies needed for peer response is an effective way to assist interaction and negotiation among students. Successful peer response requires knowledge and skills of many kinds (e.g, knowledge of written discourse, knowledge of the goals of the task and their roles in it, skills to initiate and sustain negotiation, etc.); lack of such knowledge and skills can reduce the effectiveness of interaction and negotiation during peer response.

Peer response is a dynamic event taking place in specific social, cultural, and institutional contexts. It entails what Gee (1992) refers to as Discourse, $\mathbf { \ " { a } }$ socioculturally distinctive and integrative way of thinking, acting, interacting, talking, and valuing connected with a particular social identity or role, with its own unique history and often with its own distinctive 'props' " (p. 33). A Discourse is a "sort of 'identity kit' which comes complete with appropriate costume and instructions on how to act, talk, and often write, so as to take on a particular role that others will recognize" (p. 33). For many students, the Discourse involved in peer response groups in composition classes may be relatively new, and it is important to master. According to Gee, Discourses are mastered by "enculturation into social practices through scaffolded and supported interaction with people who have already mastered the Discourse" (p. 92). Therefore, teachers can help students master the Discourse entailed in peer response by scaffolding and supporting students through interaction. The training conferences described in this study illustrate one way in which this can be accomplished.

Peer response takes place in specific contexts, and is influenced by various conditions and factors. So far, research on peer response has primarily been concerned with the cognitive and social benefits of peer interaction. Although it is crucial to examine these benefits, a thorough understanding of peer response requires a close examination of those conditions and factors that affect peer interaction, one of which is student preparation as suggested by this study. The need to examine the effects of the contexts on peer group work has been suggested by cooperative-learning researchers. In a recent article, Cohen (1994) argued that cooperative learning research should move beyond its concern with the effectiveness of small group learning to a closer examination of the conditions and factors that make for productive interaction within small groups. The same step should also be taken in peer response research. The fact that there was variability in student interaction within the groups participating in this study seems to suggest that, besides student preparation, there are other factors that affect student interaction during peer response. Our understanding of peer response will not be complete without an understanding of those conditions and factors.

Examining how different factors, including the kind of preparation that students receive, influence the success of peer response may also help make sense of the largely inconclusive research findings on the effectiveness of peer response groups. Because the conditions under which peer response takes place are not always clearly documented and controlled in research studies, it is not clear what leads to effective peer response in some cases but not in others. By delineating and systematically investigating the role of different factors in peer response, research may provide a fuller picture of why and how peer response groups work.

This study investigated the effects of training for peer response on college students' ability to comment on peer writing. With the increasingly important role of peer response in writing instruction, more research is needed to inform effective classroom practice. Future research can examine peer response along different lines.

First, more research can be conducted to explore other methods of training for peer response and investigate the effects of those methods on students' writing as well as their peer response processes. Research can also examine the effects of training for the different skills needed for peer response.

Second, future research can investigate whether and to what extent students incorporate peer feedback in their writing. In addition, research can examine the impact of peer response processes on student revision. Goldstein and Conrad (1990) found a positive relationship between negotiation in the writing conference and successful revision by college ESL students. It would be interesting to see if such a relationship holds for negotiation in peer response groups and students' ensuing revision in general. Also, research can examine whether there is a relationship between incorporation of peer feedback, often considered an important criterion for evaluating the success of peer response (Nelson & Murphy, 1993), and the quality of student writing. Research in this area will shed more light on the role of peer response in student writing development.

Last, but not least, future research can investigate the effects of classroom contexts and various other factors on training and on peer response. Research in this area will provide insightful information on the kinds of classroom contexts conducive to peer response and thus will have important classroom implications. Specifically, future research can investigate the effects of those factors that have been found to bear on group work, including (a) the nature of help provided by peers (i.e., whether the help is solicited and adequate), (b) group composition, (c) task structure, (d) task instructions, (e) participant roles, (f) status of group members, and $( \mathbf { g } )$ reward structure (Cohen, 1994; Saunders, 1989; Slavin, 1991; Webb, 1989).

In their book Rousing Minds to Life, Tharp and Gallimore (1988) defined teaching as assisted performance through the process of social interaction. The source of assistance can vary, and students can be assisted by teachers as well as by peers. According to Tharp and Gallimore, teachers can assist students not only to achieve better individual performance, but also to develop skills so that they can help one another. The results of this study revealed that when teachers trained students to assist one another in classroom peer response sessions, students indeed assisted one another much more effectively. With more research on peer response, writing instructors will be able to refine further the use of peer response in writing instruction.

# Holistic Scoring Scale

A $\prime \prime 5 \prime \prime$ essay is outstanding in all areas of composition. It is particularly distinguished in content, containing an interesting, original, and sometimes even risky thesis. The essay is fully developed and organized in a way that underscores and builds upon the main idea. A $\prime 5 \prime \prime$ essay addresses the assignment thoroughly and incorporates fresh and precise language, while usage and mechanics show few if any deviations from the conventions of standard edited English. What distinguishes a $\prime \prime 5 \prime \prime$ essay is the ease with which mature ideas flow from one to the other in support of a central thesis.

A $" 4 "$ essay is solid in all areas of composition. The topic is interesting and worthwhile to an educated reader, and the ideas are fully developed and logically organized. A $" 4 "$ essay addresses the assignment sufficiently. The paper contains few if any deviations from standard usage and incorporates precise and appropriate diction.

A $\mathit { \Pi } ^ { \prime \prime } 3 ^ { \prime \prime }$ essay is a sound composition that may lack the focus and development of a $\prime \prime 5 \prime \prime$ or $" 4 "$ essay. It is characterized by a clear thesis given sufficient treatment to validate it; however, a $\prime \prime 3 \prime$ essay often fails to intrigue an educated reader. A $\prime 3 \prime$ essay addresses the assignment, but not in the same way a $" 5 "$ or $" 4 "$ paper does. The essay is orderly and contains few deviations from standard English, but may be marked by a rigid or mechanical organization that draws attention away from the ideas themselves.

A $" 2 "$ essay is weak in one or more areas of composition. It is difficult to understand for some reason: It may have a vague, poorly stated, or simplistic thesis; it may lack a cohesive organization that leads the reader from one point to the next; it may fail to develop ideas in a manner satisfactory to an educated reader; it may address the assignment superficially; or it may have significant problems with grammar, spelling, or language usage. Any number of weaknesses may characterize a $" 2 "$ essay.

The $" 1 \prime$ essay is unacceptable in one or more of the areas of composition. It may fail to address the assignment, contain numerous serious grammatical errors, unclear or misleading expressions, illogical organization, or negligible content. In short, it does not succeed in communicating ideas to an educated reader.

# NOTES

1. Because of the often assumed relationship between students' writing ability and their ability to comment on peer writing, a pretest was given to all participating students to determine whether the experimental and control groups were similar in terms of writing ability. Students were given 4 to 5 days to complete the pretest, a take-home writing assignment that asked students to respond to a passage on individualism.

2. Tim Hacker, an experienced composition instructor at Northern Arizona University, had used individual conferences to train students for peer response prior to the study. One transcript of his conference was analyzed at the instructor training session. 3. Although peer feedback on three assignments was collected, only that on the last two assignments was analyzed, for two reasons. First, peer feedback on the first of the three assignments might not reliably reflect the impact of training for peer response because the first round of training was perceived as, and indeed was, a trial round. Second, there was considerable variability in the writing tasks students were given for the first of the three assignments; writing tasks for the last two assignments were much more uniform, all involving expository writing.

4. The 190 comments were taken out of the 201 comments discussed in the preceding section. Note that only those comments on global and local features of writing were rated; evaluative comments such as ${ } ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { I }$ really like the paper" or "good paper" were not rated because these comments seemed mostly to serve interpersonal purposes.

5. Before students' essays were scored, a norming session was conducted. In this session, the researcher discussed the holistic scoring criteria with the readers. The researcher then gave each reader a set of papers written by students participating in the study and asked the readers to identify a $\mathit { \Omega } ^ { \prime \prime } 5 ^ { \prime \prime }$ paper, a $" 4 "$ paper, a $\because$ paper, and so on, according to the scoring criteria. The two readers reached perfect agreement on papers identified to represent writing of differing quality. Characteristics of these papers were discussed with reference to the grading criteria. During holistic scoring, the readers constantly referred to the scoring rubric to ensure adherence to the criteria. Also, reliability checks were made regularly and discrepancies were immediately discussed and handled. Following standard procedures, a difference by one point in the two raters' scores on any paper was acceptable; however, when the readers differed by two or more points, they were asked to discuss their scores and resolve the difference. It was planned that if the two readers were not able to resolve the difference, the researcher would serve as the third reader. This, however, never occurred because the two readers were able to resolve all the major differences that arose on a few papers.

6. One hundred forty-five students, 73 from the experimental group and 72 from the control group, completed the prewriting assignment. The mean score for the experimental group was 3.00, with a standard deviation of .61. The mean for the control group was 2.97, with a standard deviation of .68.

7. Before MANOVA was conducted, assumptions underlying multivariate analyses were checked following the recommendations of Tabachnick and Fidell (1989). Two outliers were identified on the "amount of relevant and specific feedback" variable and were removed from analysis. The assumption of homogeneity was not met (the outcome of Box's M test was significant at $p < . 0 0 1 ,$

8. Multivariate assumptions were also checked for this analysis. One outlier was found on the "amount of feedback on global features" variable within the experimental group and was eliminated from analysis.

9. Goldstein and Conrad (1990) defined episodes as subunits of the conferences, with each episode having ${ \pmb { \mu } } _ { \bf { a } }$ unique combination of topic and purpose such that a change in either or both signifies a new episode. Episodes could be interrupted by others, continuing at the end of the interruption" (p. 488). Their definition was adopted in this study.

10. Although Student A and the writer took more turns in this episode, the discussion from which the episode was taken was characterized by a rather equal distribution of turns among group members.

11. All instructors had indicated to the researcher that their experimental classes did better on peer response than their control classes. At the end of the semester, students in all participating classes were invited to comment on the use of peer response groups in their classes. Comments from the experimental group were far more favorable.
