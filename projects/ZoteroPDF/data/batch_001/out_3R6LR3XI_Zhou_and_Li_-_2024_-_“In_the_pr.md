Keywords: Prepositional phrase-frames Chinese EFL learners Developmental features Academic English

This paper delves into the overall use, grammatical patterns, and discourse-pragmatic functions of Prepositional Phrase-frames (PP-frames) utilized by Chinese EFL learners across Bachelor's theses, Master's theses, and Doctoral dissertations, in comparison with research articles (RAs) of Applied Linguistics. The analysis of these discontinuous formulaic language used in crosssectional learner corpora and the RA corpus is pivotal for understanding the connection between academic literacy level and formulaic expressions in academic writing and for appreciating the development of phraseological competence among L1 Chinese writers as they navigate their way into the complexity of academic English. The findings unravel a growing tendency in the overall frequencies of use and a developmental trend in lexico-grammatical diversity and more genre- and discipline-specific functional characteristics, as Chinese EFL student writers advance through their academic journey from the undergraduate level to the doctoral level. A thorough analysis of functional dimensions of PP-frames in theses and dissertation writing reveals an increased level of functional complexity in the use of PP-frames for referential and discourse organizing functions. This study contributes to academic English instructions of PP-frames.

# 1. Introduction

Prepositional phrase is often regarded as a\*minor process" in the ideational dimension and a\*minor predicate" in the interpersonal dimension (Hliday, 2004, pp. 359-360) when viewed from the perspective of Systemic Functional Grammar. Formulaic expressions based on prepositional phrases (hereafter reerred to as Prepositional Phrase-frames, or P-frames) are high-frequency pattrns that are more variable in academic writing than in conversations (Biber, 2009; Lu et al., 2018) fulilling semantic enrichment (Geluso, 2022) and realizing rhetorical fuctions (Casal & Kessler, 2020; Lu et al. 2021). Despite th fact that these formulaic expresions tend to be incdtally acquired (Ellis 208; Le t al., 2020; Li & chmitt, 2009), even aanced Eglish lner fin it chllenging to use PP-frames like English L1 users (Gasset al., 2020; Geluso, 202; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014). Moreover, existing topics related to formulaic language in academic writing have often been investigated in a broad sense, mostly focusing on continuous fixed sequences, with rather limited attention to the formulaic langage featured with phrase-frames (Rmer, 2010, p. 103), i., \*smi-ixed sequences that contain a variable slot that can be illed by different words" (Lu et al., 2018, p. 76). Particularly, frames based on prepositional phrases are frequently embedded formulaic sequences in academic writing. The observation provides further evidence that in L2 learners academic English writing, there i a misuse of PP-frames (Geluso, 2022; Hong, 2018) and a high error rate of prepositin misuses (Lee et al., 2020). Casal and Kesser (2020, p. 9) also demonstrate that phrase-frames \*have a noteworthy pedagogical potential to develop learner awareness and repertoires i terms of both convention and creativity in formal writing. Therefore, the current study on the use of PP-frames has pedagogical value (Geluso, 2022; Lu et al., 2018), especiall in enhancing our understanding Of EFL learners' phraseological competence in academic English writing.

One objective of the present study is to gain insights into the grammatical patterns and discourse-pragmatic functions of PP-frames by describing their frequencies and distriutions i Chines FL leaners thees anddisrations, in comparison with reeach articles (RAs) in the field of Applied Linguistics. The other objective isto discern the developmental trend in Chinese EFL leaners theses and dissertations, as these recurrent formulaic sequences reflect a proficient level f academic writing, as noted by Biber and Gary (2010) and Parkinson and Musgrave (2014).In other words, this study aims to describe and explain the similarities and diferences in the use of PP-frames by Chinese EFL leaners at three academic literacy levels, focusing on overall frequencies, grammatical patterns, and discourse-pragmatic functions when viewed cros-sectionally. It also seeks to determine whether there is a periodic development in these variations. This research, which has not been systematically addressed in previous literature, will provide evidence to inform pedagogical practice and offer useful information for future studies on the developmental trajecory of phraseological competence n EFL academic writing.

# 2. Literature review

A PP-frame is normally perceived as consisting of discontinuous formulaic expressions with at least one variable slot. We divide them into two basic grammatical pattrns: the Internal Variable Slots and the Final Variable Slots. The Internal Variable Slots are a discontinuous structure f P-frames illed with a noun component with one or two intenal slots, such as i the \*of. The Final Variable Slots, as the name sugests, reer to the structures with oneor two open slots at the end ofPP-frames, such as of second \* and in termsof \*. Biber (2009 found that academic prose prefers Internal Variable Slots of 4-word PP-frames that emerge with the co-occurrence of certain frames and particular wors. For example, the PP-frame in the \*f often contains slot-fiers such as case, asence, fom context course, rocess etc.; illers that occr in the P-frame at the \* of inlude end, time, beginnng, etc., which indicat the iversty of the frames and the creativity of the users.

Recurrent formulaic expressions are a \*quick and reliable" resource that members of a speech community use to support their desired communicative needs, and research on their functions can reveal much about the nature of interaction (Conklin & Schmit, 2008). One of the most significant studies in this facet is Biber et al.'s (2004) taxonomy of the functions of formulai expressions. They distinguished among three primary functions: referential expressions, discourse organizers, and stance expressions. Referential expressions \*make direct reference to physical or astract entitie, or to the textual context itself (ibid., p. 384); discourse organizers reflect the \*relationships between prior and coming discourse (ibid.) stance expressions expressatitudes or assessments of the certainty that frame some other proposition' (ibid.), conveying speakers' attitudes and convictions about the proposition. Simpson-Vlach and Ells (2010) credited Biber et al's (2004) clasification in their study and expanded it by grouping the top academic formulas used in academic discourse into discourse-pragmatic functional categories. With regard to the discourse-pragmatic functions of PP-frames, we identify the function groups on the basis of the first noun in the propositional phrase (viz., the slot-fier) as it often indicates a specialized component or attribute of the following noun phrase and proposition (Sinclair, 1991, p. 87-90). That is tosay, the semantic group of the noun filler detmines the function that the P-rame fulfill in th pattern Haegard, 2019). Table 1 lists the discourse-pragmatic functions and subfunctions of P-frames based on Simpson-Vlach and Elis's (2010) clasification scheme.

The first primary function of PP-frames is referential expressions. As in most cases, they serve as adverbials or post-modifiers ir clauses, which enable the salience of propositional contents or (in)tangible atributes of a following noun phrase (e.g., in terms of \*, )

PP-frames also perform the functions of organizing discourse and presenting the relationship between the text and its content, including metadiscourse and textual reference (e.g., in the preent study, in the next part), topi elaboration (mainly concerning cause and effects, e.g, for the purpose of \*, as a result of \*), and discourse markers (e.g., in conjunction with \*, in other words \*, etc. Furthermore, P-frames can also aid in expressing abilities and attitudes, as well as constructing ealuatie discours (i.., stance expressions), such as with the help of \*, in my humble opinion, and from the perspective of \*, etc.

Building on Biber et al. (2004), Garner (2016) and Tan and Romer (2022) conducted research on L2 learners' use f phrase-frames in a learner corpus spanning various proficiency levels. They found that while most of the phrase-frames primarily served areferential function, L2 learners increasingly employed more functionally complex phrase-frames as their proficiency level advanced.

Similarly, in astudy by Lu et al. (2018) on the multi-word phrase-frames in RA introductions, based on Simpson-Vlach and Ellis's (2010) classfication, the referential frames were found to be the most frequent primary function, with the second-lel subfunction of specification ofattributes being the most common. Geluso (2022) also observed that in argumentative esays at the university level by both L1 English and Spanish speakers, the referential functions of P-frames were significantly more prevalent than the functions of discourse organizing and stance functions, with stance frames being the least common.

Being underscored for their importance in many studies, PP-frames, as acombination of prepositional frames and noun phrases, play a common yet increasingly significant role in enhancing grammatical complexity and information density as L2 writer advance in academic writing (Biber & Gary, 2010; Geluso, 2022). For one, Biber t al. (2011) found that the use of formulaic sequences based on prepositional phrases emerges at a later developmental stage of grammatical complexity in academic writing, threby indicating a more eficint command of grammatical devices by L2 academic writrs. For another, the post-modifying nouns following PP-fra mes--such as extended noun groups or complex embedded nominal groups--inevitably make the text denser (Hlliday & Martin, 1993), which gives us reasons to believe that L2 academic writers may benefit from an enriched repertoire of academic formulaic expressions that include not only continuous set expressions but also discontinuous frames and their many variants.

However, existing research has found a discouraging level of diversity in L2 learners' use of formulaic expressions, where therei an overreliance on the ones they have mastered and a sparse use of the habitual expressions commonly used by L1 English speakers (Hyland, 2008a; Li & Schmitt 2009). Previous studies also suggest that, in terms of phrasal frames used in academic writing of So ciology, the overall frequency of prepositional phrases in PhD dissertations is not significantly different from that in reearch articles (Benelhadj, 2019), while undergraduate L2 writers use fewer P-based bundles than L1 English users in academic prose (Lee et al., 2020).

A relevant study is Geluso's (2022) recent research on the grammatical and functional features of recurrent PP-frames in English argumentative essays by undergraduate L1 English speakers and Spanish ESL learners. Geluso (2022)found striking variations in the mean rats foccrre, typs f grammticl strctres, and dicourse funtios. Fr example, fr speific P-frames, such as onthe \* of and by the \*f, frequeny differnes are dntifie though the us f sme thr P-frmes dos not differ siiicany;  English speakers tend to use P-frames as post-modifiers at higher rates than their counterpart, and 1 speakers use of frames mainly serve to frame an intangible attribute of the following noun phrases (e.g., for the good of), while Spanish ESL leaners use more PP-frames to mark research procedures (e., inthe preparation of). However, Geluso's (2022) research targets solely the frame "preposition $+ \ t h e ^ { \mathrm { ~ * ~ } }$ of as produced in English arumentative and literary esays, which rstricts the gneralizabilit f the reearch reults. And, he kindy recommended allowing for more variables in the slots in future studies.

Moreover, there is a paucity of research on the usage of PP-frames by advanced EFL learners across diffrent levels of academic writing experience, as well as the analysi of their patterns of use and discourse-pragmatic functions in thes and dissertation writing. Therefore, we intend to fill the research gap by exploring how L1 Chinese writers f academic English use P-frames in terms of frequencies of use, grammatical patterns, and discourse-pragmatic functions. A corpus analysis is conducted on Chinese EFL learners Bachelor's theses, Masters theses, and Doctoral dissertations, with research articles (RAs) serving as the usage benchmark and reference corpus. The study will address three specific research questions to clarify these issues:

1. What are the overal frequencies of PP-frames in the corpora of theses and disertations written by Chinese EFL learners and RA corpus in Applied Linguistics?   
2. What are the developmental features of the grammatical patterns of PP-frames across the corpora of theses and dissertations by Chinese EFL learners?   
3. What are developmental features of discourse-pragmatic functions of P-frames across the corpora of theses and dissertations by Chinese EFL learners?

# 3. Research design

# 3.1. Corpora

Three elf-compiled corpora, consisting of theses and dissertations produced by Chinese EFL learners, were used for this study. The first corpus includes Bachelor's theses written by L1 Chinese university undergraduate students majoring in English. The second and third corpora comprise Master's theses and Doctoral dissertations, respectively, authored by L1 Chinese postgraduate students at the master's and doctoral levels, with a focus on the field of Applied Linguistics.

As a benchmark for comparison, a fourth corpus--the RA corpus--was established. This corpus is composed of research articles written by 1 English-speaking scholars in Applied Linguitics. The articles were randomly sampled from six intenationally renowned journals within the field: Applied Linguistics, Modern Language Jounal, TE0L Quarterly, Language Learning, Language Teaching Research and Second Language Research. These ournals, recognized for thir high impact factors, were endorsed by experts in Aplied Linguistics to represent the standard of quality academic writing within the discipline.

Bestgen (2020), by taking into account the quantitative linguistc point of view, recognized the significant effect of the corpus size differences between the compared corpora on the efficiency of identification of the frequently recurring formulaic language. Such differences may skew the categorization of tructural fetures and subsequent qualitative analyses. To avoid potential ias and ensure a fair comparison of PP-frames among the corpora on which the current study i based, the corpora were carefully matched in size ach corpus comprises approximately 1.15 million tokens, minimizing the risk of disparities that could afect the study's outcome.

The corpus of Chinese EFL learners' Bachelor's theses are composed of 235 undergraduate theses from English departments at various universities in China, focusing on the subjects of English teaching and learning. A total of 70 Masters theses and 25 Doctoral dissertations in the field of Applie Linguisics were randomly selected from the CNKI Thesis & Dissrtation Database (https://www. cnki.net). The RA corpus contains 150 research articles.

We checked the family names of the authors of RAs in an online surname database (http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/) to make sure that RA writers are 1 English users. Furthermore, we removed sections such as Tables of Content, Appendices, Acknowledgments, References, and table and graphs from the corpora. Table 2 offers an overview of the sub-corpora used in this study.

The compilation of our corpus distinguishes our study from existing cross-sectional research on the development of learners use of p-frames. While Garner's (2016) and Tan and Romer's (2022) studies utilized open database of German and Chinese L2 learners course writing aignments, including argumentatie texts, emails and summarie, or focus i onthees anddiserations produced by L1 Chinese student writers, which could be seen as the text types crucial for the writers application for \*admission to the academy' (Paltridge & Starfield, 2020, p. 2). In such formal academic contexts, student writers are more likely to employ linguistic devices, including the target P-frames, with greater care and precision. Consequently, erors and misspllings are substantively reduced.

Our study varies from the previous research in another significant aspect: the convergence on major topics within the sampled disciplinary texts. According to Geluso's (2022) research, topic variations in the corpus can influence the use of noun fllers in the PP-frames, thereby exerting an impact on the discourse-pragmatic functions of the target frames. In light of this, the present study's corpora were carefully curated to include only empirical study papers, both qualitative and quantitive, in the scope of Applied Linguistic studies. The decision to confine the dataset to a single discipline stems from Benelhadj's (2019) findings that the prepositional phrases used in PhD dissertations are greatly iluenced by disciplinary variations. By focusing on a specifi discipline, we aim to eliminate the disciplinary inluence and more clearly reveal how Chinese EFL student writers develop and refine thir phraseological competence as their academic literacy levels go up.

Despite our best efforts to align the Chinese EFL leaner corpora and RA corpus in terms of registers, there are inherent dfferences between them, such as the intended readership, which introducecertain inevitable limitations when comparing the academic writing across Chinese EFL learners theses and dissertations with RAs. To mitigate this limitation, we adopted a rigorous sampling methodology that focused on including only empirical applied linguistic studies in each corpus, excluding purely theoretical works. In addition, the majorit of our comparisons, taking a cros-sectional perspective, examined the developmental features of PP-frames deployed in the theses and dissertations of Chinese EFL learners.

# 3.2. Procedures

4-word PP-frames were considered as the research focus in this study, allowing us to showcase a somewhat more comprehensive picture of phraseological competence of L1 Chinese writers of academic English. Compared with 3- or 5-word formulas and phrase frames, 4-word counterparts are more suitable for reflecting the characteristic of the discipline in academic writing (Biber, 2009; Geluso, 2022; Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010) and writing topics in L2 writing (Tan & Romer, 2022).

The paper adopted a mixed-methods approach that combined corpus-based automatic concordance analysis with close scrutiny of manual annotation by experienced reearchers specialized in the feld of Applied Linguistics. In this proces, recurrent frmulaic sequences were initiall sife out by automatic extraction, and then P-frames were carefull filered and identified. Simpson-Vlach and Elli (2010) previously utilized a similar method in their reearch on the Academic Formulas List, discovering that the formulaic language extracted and identified through this combined approach was more closely in line with the characteristics of the discipline and practical requirements of academic writing.

3.2.1. Automatic extraction and manual identification of PP-frames We extracted 4-word formulaic sequence from the corpus using N-gram toos in AntConc Version 4.1.4 (Anthony, 2022), which is

widely used (Bestgen & Granger, 2014, p. 29). A literature research disclosed acertain degre f arbitrinessin the determination of frequency and rang thresholds, as noted in L t al. (2018), rangi from the lowest frequecy f 10 hits per millon words (eg., Tan & Romer, 2022) to the highest of 0 hits (e.g., Biber et al., 2004), with a cut-off point se at an occurrence in at least 3 to 5 texs (e.g, Biber, 2009; Tan & Romer, 2022). To set up an appropriate threshold that caters to the size of our corpus, we opted for moderate level of at least 25 hits per million words and a minimal occurrence in at least 4 texts.

In the manual identification phase, theN-gram lists for each of the four corpora were sorted by frequency. The four resultig lists of 4-word fomulaic sequence lists were then subjected to further manual iltring. Initill, we selected the PP-frames, i., the frames with a preposition preceding a noun phrase-frame. Next, when observed in KwIc, the instances of PP-frames that solely contained proper nouns, numerals and symols were removed (., in the nted Kingdom, from to b). Finall, the instnes of spific P-frames that lacked semantic significance and could not be categorized within a discourse or pragmatic function,such as of vocabulary in the and of teacher and the, were also excluded.

# 3.2.2. Grammatical and functional analyses

In order to investigate the grammatical patterns of P-frames used in the corpora, we established a classficationfor alleligble 4- word PP-frames, differentiating between Internal Variable Slots and Final Variable Slots. As mentioned earlier, since the first slot is consistently filled by a preposition, the target PP-frames with Internal Variable Slots include ${ } ^ { 1 ^ { * } 3 4 }$ ${ 1 2 ^ { * } 4 }$ ${ \bf 1 } ^ { * } { \bf 3 } ^ { * }$ , and ${ 1 ^ { * * } 4 }$ : PP-frames with Final Variable Slots comprise ${ \bf 1 2 3 ^ { * } }$ and $1 2 ^ { * * }$ . Accordingly, the PP-frames were grouped into two grammatical patterns in each corpus.

To explore the diversity of P-frames used in each corpora, we adopted the notions of Token and Type. A Token denotes the raw frequency with which a PP-frame occurs, whereas a Type indicates the number of distinct categories of a specific P-frame. For example f th r 10cr f in the \*f reli  15 diffent sfic P-frme, such as in th a f and in h s then the Token of in the \* of is 100, and the Type is 15.

With regard to functional analysis, we conducted a variant-based concordance analysis, which involved examining each PP-frame in light of the semantic meaning of the slot-fller within its immediate context of use. This approach was also implemented in Romer (2010) and Lu et al. (2018), which focus on the contextualized use of phrase-frames, resonating with the rationale underpinning the current study. We annotated these PP-frames into primary discourse-pragmatic functions and second-level subfunctions, following Simpson-Vlach and Elli's (2010) functional taxonomy (See Table 1). This annotation may lead to the identification of aPP-frame as serving multiple functions, with its specific function(s) deending onthe contexual meaning of slot-fllers, as noted by Lu et al. (2018)

To eliminate subjectivity in the functional analysis, we independently carried out the coding procedures of the P-frames' functions, following a protocol established after collaboratively annotating ten percent of the data in an initial joint coding. The final coding was measured by Cohen's Kappa, which yielded a value of 0.892 for both primary functions and second-level subfunctions. This value indicates an acceptable level of inter-oder reliabilit. Subsequently, we engaged in a discussion to resolve any discrepancies, ensuring the consistency of the coding outcomes.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Overall frequencies of PP-frames

A growing tendency in the overall frequencies of PP-frames can be observed acros the theses and dissertations of Chinese EFL learners at the BA (2,656), MA (3,081), and PhD (4,081) levels. The significance of these variations was assessed using a Log. Likelihood test and an efect size calculator (htps:/ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/llwizard.html). The test results indicat significant differences between the corpora of Chinese EFL learners: BA vs MA $( \mathrm { L L } = - 3 0 . 5 7 , p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = - 1 3 . 1 6 $ , MA vs PhD $( \mathrm { L L } = - 1 3 9 . 3 2 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = - 2 4 . 4 5$ , BA vs PhD $( \mathrm { L L } = - 2 9 9 . 4 5 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = - 3 4 . 7 2 $ . These findings suggest a progressive increase in the overall use of PP-frames as Chinese EFL learners advance through their academic programs.

When we compared the Tokens of P-frames in Chinese EFL learners' BA, MA and PhD theses and dissertations with those in the reference corpus RA (3,049), a notable difference was found between BA and RA $( \mathrm { L L } = - 2 6 . 8 0$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = - 1 2 . 8 2 $ . This finding is partially consistent with Le et al.'s (2020) study, which observed that undergraduate Korean EFL learners employed fewer prepositional bundles in their argumentative essays than the published writers in the academic prose, as reported by Biber et al. (199). Additionall, Geluso (2022) detected variations in the frequencie of Prepositional phrases between undergraduate Spanish EFL learners and English L1 speakers.

Another notable finding was the significant difference in the frequencies of PP-frames between the PhD and RA corpora $\left( \mathrm { L L } = \right.$ 147.59, $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = 3 3 . 5 5$ , which stands in contrast to Benelhadj's (2019) conclusion that no statistical divergence in frequency exiss between these groups. This discrepancy may be related to the L1 backgrounds of the writer. In our study, the PhD student writers are 1 Chinese EFL learners, whereas Benelhadj (2019) did not specify the L1 background of the PhD student writers. f the writers in question are native English speakers, it i conceivable that the L2 status of Chinese student writers may have influenced the usage of PP-frames in their dissertations.

The frequency difference between the MA and RA corpora $( \mathrm { L L } = 0 . 1 2 , p = 0 . 7 2 6$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = 0 . 9 0$ ) was less pronounced. The observed increase in the phraseological competence of MA Chinese EFL student writers can be ascribed to their gradual mastery of lexical phrases. This is in line with the findings of Li and Schmit (209), who studied a Chinese EFL student writing a Master's thesis in Applied Linguistics. They demonstrated that as this student writer gained more experience in academic writing, she acquired and utilized an increasing number of lexical phrases in her academic writing.

# 4.2. Grammatical patterns

To examine the variation in grammatical patterns, we first grouped PP-frames used in the corpora into Internal Variable Slots (IVS) or Final Variable Slots (FVS), and then we identified the prepositions within the P-frames and the noun fillers. Our analysis revealed that the most frequently occurring P-frames were those led by the propositions in, at, as, with, for, of, between, on and to. Table 3 presents the raw frequencies of these PP-frames in the form of Token and Type.

Table 3 shows that, in terms of token frequency, the MA, PhD and RA corpora exhibit a preference for IVS over FVS, with P-frames led by in, on/to t, of, and as, comprising the top five most frequently occurring prepositions. In contrast, FVS was adopted in a higher rate as the primary grammatical paten for P-frames in the BA corpus, as exmplified by i or \* ., in our dail life, n our English learning, etc.).

The Type reflects the variabilit i the combinations of prepositional frames and their fllers. As depicted in Table 3, the Type count for PP-frames in the BA corpus is the lowest (39), suggesting a relatively limited diversty of PP-frames at this level. This result is partially consistent with the findings of Li and Schmitt's (2009) and Le et al's (2020), which posit that the undergraduate EFL student author(s) tend to draw les on P-frames. Table 3 also indicates that the Type counts for the MA (50) and the PhD (53) corpora are roughly comparable to that of the RA corpus (52). This patten demonstrates asignificant enhancement i the diversity of P-frames as the academic literacy level of Chinese EFL student writers increases.

Regarding the specific fillers within these P-frames, it is found that the fillers in IVS of RAs closely align with Biber's (2009) observation of PP-frames in RAs. In contrast, the fillers in the BA corpus exhibits the lowest degree of similarity $( 3 3 \% )$ with Biber's (2009) data. An increasing rate of similarity can be noted in the MA and PhD corpora, with a notable rate of $6 6 \%$ in relation to Biber's (2009) findng. This p of conie prgs i filler silritie i illstrtd in Tble 4, using th hgh-frquey P-frame in the \* of as an example.

In terms of FVS, several PP-frames were commonly employed acros al four corpora. Thee include at the same \*(with time the most frequent filler) a exemplified in examples 1) and 2), and on th other \* (with hand the most frequent filler, as shown in example 3). A specific P-frame that merged in the BA corus is n our dly lif, as llustratd in example 4). However, it has beobserved that this PP-frame is predominantly used in non-academic genres, a pattern confirmed by a search in the British National Corpus.

1) learners have their own work and at the same time, they also have to improve   
2) in the overall macro-structure, and, at the same time, it also underscores   
3) on the other hand, forms which are not meaningful can be attended to   
4) it happens everywhere in our daily life

The PP-frames in/of the present/current \* and in other words \* were notably prevalent in the MA (as shown in example 5) and PhD (as shown in example 6) corpora, mirring thir usage in the RA (as in example 7) corpus. Such usage ischaractristic of academic discourse, serving the function of discourse reference (Li & Wei, 2013) and the reiteration of metadiscourse (Halliday, 2004)

To asses the periodic variations in the use of frames introduced by dfferent prepositions, we computed the normalized frequencies for each preposition in frames per million words (pmw). This allowed usto determine the frequency ratio for BA vs RA,MA vs RA, PhD vs RA for each preposition. These comparative ratios are graphically represented in Fig. 1.

As depicted by the horizontal lie in Fig 1, areference ratio of 1signifie that the normalized frequencies of the frames led by the specific prepositions are approximately equivalent across the two compared corpora. If the ratio exceeds 1, it means that th irst corus mos  ghr frquenc f sch frme thn the scond coverely f he ratii  than 1, it sugts thatth first corus uses them les frequently. Fig. 1 demonstrates that the most pronounced differences in frequency occurred with PP-frames beginning with for and between, where Chinese EFL student writers used them at rates $3 0 \% { - } 3 6 9 \%$ higher than in the RA corpus. In contrast, English L1 published writers exhibited a marked preference for PP-frames starting with as. The ratios of P-frames beginning with at, on/to, i, of and with fluctated across the academic levels, with the first three preositions showing an increase i the usage from the BA to the PhD level, reflcting a richer academic writing experience. The last two prepositions, of and with, however, showed a decrease in occurrence from the BA to the MA level, followed by a resurgence in frequency from the MA to the PhD level.

# 4.3. Discourse-pragmatic functions

According to the statistics presented in Table 5, referential expressions constitute the most significant function of P-frames accounting for $6 6 \% { - } 7 6 \%$ of the total usage. Discourse organizers follow in importance, representing $1 7 \% - 2 6 \%$ of the PP-frames. Stance expressions hold the smallest share, comprising only $1 \% { - } 6 \%$ of the total, which can be said very rare. This general distribution of the three primary discourse-pragmatic functions overlaps with the results in Garner's (2016) analysis of 4-word phrase-frames. The proportion of multifunctional PP-frames is relatively low, ranging from $4 \%$ to $8 \%$ . Similarly, Lu et al. (2018) observed a comparable percentage of multifunctional phrase-frames, around $7 \%$

When viewed across the thesis and dissertation corpora, P-frames as referential expressions exhibit an increasing pattern of use. There is a notably higher frequency of referential expressions in the MA corpus than the BA corpus $( \mathrm { L L } = 8 2 . 1 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } =$ 24,79), and a further increase in their use is observed in the PhD corpus relative to the MA corpus $( \mathrm { L L } = 2 3 . 3 5 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ 3 $\% \mathrm { D I F F } =$ 14.64).

Additionally, Table 5 indicates a significant spike in the utilization of PP-frames as discourse organizers at the PhD level $\left( \mathrm { L L } = \right.$ 178.41, $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ 3 $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = 9 9 . 1 0 )$ . This surge follows a slight decline in the use of discourse-oriented PP-frames in the MA corpus compared to the BA corpus $( \mathrm { L L } = - 9 . 4 9 $ $p < 0 . 0 5$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = - 1 9 . 7 8 )$

We also found that PP-frames as stance expressions constituted the smallest proportion in the thesis and disertation corpora However, a higher percentage in the BA corpus indicates statistically significant differences when compared to the MA $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 1 4 . 4 7 , p$ $< 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = 6 3 4 . 9 7 )$ and the PhD corpora $( \mathrm { L L } = 5 8 . 8 3 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = 2 2 1 . 7 9$

In addition to the primary functions, Table 6 offrs a summary of the normalized frequencies (pmw) of high-frequency subfunctions. The subsequent sections of this study willilustrat PP-frames that realize different subfunctions with a discussion on their contextual usage across the four corpora.

# 4.3.1. Referential PP-frames

# a. Specification of attributes

In the BA corpus, problems arise from two primary sources: firstly, an insuficient use of all three sub-types of specification of attributes, and secondly, a misuse of prepositions within high-frequency frames that involve intangible framing attributes. For instance, Chinese FL ners oten incorrtly use prositions in the frmes such as through the analysis of and dring h prossf (as exemplified in example 8. The rors contrast with the correct ue fin the analysis of and in the roces of which are commonly ound in the RA corpus.

8) the teaching of vocabulary through the analysis of the problems existing during the process of vocabulary teaching.

This pattern of misuse is echoed in Geluso's (2022, p. 10) findings, which identified a similar issue among Spanish EFL learners at the undergraduate level the incorrect use f preositions in P-frames. In the context of our study, the comparatively high incidnce of preposition misuse in Chinese EFL student writers BA theses reveals the impact of both the intructional transfer and L1 interference on the authenticit of their target language use, as discussed in Ellis (2007). Chances are the instructors explain the meaning of during to be in the whole process of which may make students translate it into hinese as zai quan guocheng zhong (+) and mistakenly view the two expressions as interchangeable.

Furthermore, the preposition through in many instances may be translated into Chinese as tongguo (it), meaning by means of, or jingguo (t), meaning across the area or via a place, but students often fail to grasp is temporal implications in English.

In the case of P-frames as tangibl framing atrbutes that denote research fields, dimensions and aspects, the BA corpus exhibits a rather limited variety, predominantly using the constructions in the fied f and "f the +rearch contents (e, o h second anguage). In contrast, the MA corpus demonstrates a more diverse use of PP-frames as tangible framing atributes, such as as part of $^ { * }$ for the most \* (part), at the \* (level) of, and \*in the $^ +$ research contents" (e.g., in the adult grammar).

# b. Identification and focus

This subfunction is used to highlight and concentrate on the referential expressions. Common expository PP-frames of this type include as/for a/an/the \* (example) of and as one of \*. These frames serve the basic pragmatic functions of exemplification and identification in academic writing. Though this subfunction was les frequent compared to other subfunctions of referential expressions, it s conducive to an expansion and llustration of the writrs aruments, making them accessile and persuasive (Hyland, 2007, p. 270), thus widely considered as a key characteristic in academic writing. As indicated in Table 6, the normalized frequencies of these PP-frames in the PhD corpus (58.9) are roughly equivalent to those in the RA corpus 55.6), with no statisticallysignificant difference $( \mathrm { L L } = 0 . 1 1$ $p = 0 . 7 3 7$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = 6 . 0 1 $

# c. Contrast and comparison

PP-frames expressing contrast and comparison, such as in contrast to \* and in line with \*, were les frequently used in the BA corpus (219) compared to the other corpora which had higher normalized frequency counts: 289.6 in MA, 297.2 in PhD, and 293.5 in RA. The statistical analyses show that, in the MA and PhD corpora, contrast and comparison PP-frames were deployed with usage rates quite similar to those in the RA corpus (for MA vs RA: $\mathrm { L L } = - 0 . 0 3 , p = 0 . 8 6 2 , \% \mathrm { D I F F } = - 1 . 3 3 ;$ for PhD vs RA: $\operatorname { L L } = 0 . 0 3$ $p = 0 . 8 7 1$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } =$ 1.25).

This subfunction is integral to the construction of evaluative meaning in academic discourse. I serves a dual purpose: on one hand it engages with prior literature or alternative perspectives by making comparisons and contras between the current study's findings with existing research; on the other hand, it acts as an interactive tol between the writer and the readers, stimulating critical engagement with the diverse positions presented in the discourse.

# d. Deictics and locatives

The divergence is also manifested in the subfunction of deictics and locatives. The PP-frame \*in the $^ +$ location nouns" (e.g., with common fillers ike midde school and highschol) was the most frequently used in the BA corpus, indicating that studies conducted at the BA level ofen focus on language learning environments such as middle or high schools. In contrast in the MA and PhD corpora, high-frequency prepositional phrases with deictic and locative meanings were frequently used to explore diverse academic topics,for example, fromhe perpective of, under th influence of, throgh h us f, on/f/o the use of, and in/on the delopment of, among thers.

It is worth noting that deictic and locative PP-frames, such as at the \* (end/beginning) of, and in the $^ { * * }$ (control/experimental group), were highly employed in the PhD corpus (436.7), appearing more than twice as frequently as in the MA corpus (204.6). The longer text of Doctoral dissertations compared to Master's theses s a contributing factor to the increased demand for referential resources, as revealed in Benelhad's (2019, p. 196) discussion on the differences in the use of prepositional phrases between Doctoral disertations and RAs.

# 4.3.2. Discourse organizing PP-frames

# a. Metadiscourse and textual reference

The normalized frequency of PP-frames that function as metadiscourse and textual reference amounted to 559.7 in the PhD corpus, well above other corpora (sparse in BA, 139.6 in MA and 242.3 in RA). This subfunction is ralized by the prepositional phrases such as in the present study, in the following part, and in the next secion, etc. itroducing the textual arrangement of topics and focuses, and guiding readers through the unfolding academic discourse. This characteristic in the PhD corpus can be attrbuted to the extended length of PhD disertations, necesstating anotably high frequency of discourse resources fr ffectie organization and structuring of the written work.

# b. Topic elaboration

Another frequently-used subfunction of discourse organizers is topic elaboration, encompassng both cause-and-effect elaboration and non-causal elaboration. This subfunction ranked the highest frequency in the BA corpus (402.3). Frequently employed cause-andeffect elaboration PP-frames include n order to \* and for the sake of, which mention purpose, and PP-frames such as as a result \*, which state results, further explicating the propositions made earlier.

For non-causal topic elaboration, which serves to enrich, rephrase or differentiate from the aforementioned topic,P-frames such as in addition to \*, in other words \*and with th exception of, are favored in the MA and PhD corpora. These PP-frames enable student writers to improve the logic flow and detail of their arguments.

# c. Discourse Markers

To set the context for the unfolding discourse, academic writers deployed the PP-frames to pin down the relational frame and the situational context. For instance the PP-frames at the same \* (time) and for a long \* (time) create temporal connections and signal transitions between the clauses; whereas in relation to \* and i conjunction with \* clarif circumstances under which certain actions or behaviors take place. These discourse markers, which are high-frequency across allcorpora, show a similar usage patten in PhD dissertations when compared to RAs $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 . 7 6$ $\textstyle p = 0 . 1 8 5$ $\% \mathrm { D I F F } = 1 9 . 5 3$

# 4.3.3. Stance PP-frames

Within the subfunctions of stance expressions, the PP-frames for the ability and possibilit describe the possible and actual be. haviors, such as wth the \* (help) of, and the high-requency P-frames for evaluation, like of the most \* important), are sued to express evaluative meanings in a superlative form (particularly prevalent in the BA corpus).

In the BA corpus, the collocations of the prepositional phrase with the help of (in the direct context of $0 / + 5$ with reference to MI value) ar nouns f behaviors or elments in the fd of languag teching and ening, such as cassmates, clsse ntctors, Inteet, etc. In conrs, the collocations in the PhD corpus can be classfied into two groups that create a context of isciplinary characteristics, one showcasing research tools, such as concordance,software, wordsmith, and dictionaries, the other highlighting reearch subjects, such as coders, experts, teacher(s), and colleagues.

The evaluation PP-frame of the most \* (important) appears on the core Academic Formulaic List as identified by Simpson-Vlach and Ellis (2010). This constructio erves to enance the perceived significance or top priority of the topic under evaluation. For instance, in example 9, extracted from the BA corpus, th frame of the most importan is useo underscorethe critical role of \*culal background knowledge", illustrating how this subfunction can be employed to highlight essential aspects.

9) Cultural background knowledge is one of the most important basis to cultivate reading quality.

# 5. Discussion

The overal frequencies of P-frames in the theses and disertations of Chinese EFL student writers show a marked increase fromthe BA to the MA and PhD levels. This trend is noteworthy as it suggests that while Chinese EFL learners may implicitly acquire phraseological knowledge of formulaic language, as Ellis (2008) posits, the differentiation in the use of these PP-frames and their appropriat tuning can beexplicitly developed through repeated use and refinement in the enhancement of academic literacy. The data from this study indicate that EFL undergraduate students tend to use P-frames les frequently and with occasional erroneous use, which may be due to their limited experience in English academic writing and misunderstanding in instructional setings. However, as these student writr avance to the ostgraduate lels, their usage aligns more closely with that of RA authors in terms of the overall frequencies, reflecting their professonal academic training and a more profound understanding of language conventions within the academic discourse communities into which they aim to gain entrance.

Moreover, an increased genre awareness and the disciplinary engagement with academic practice also collaborate in fostering development. The grammatical patterns of P-frames in theses and diserations exhibit increased diversity, together with a growing rate of similrity of fllers to those in the RA corpus and a decrease in reliance on non-academic formulaic expressions. Comparative analyses between groups show that in MA these, the grammatical patterns of PP-frames have achieved afarly stable level of variety, contrasting with the observed lack of diversity in BA theses. In PhD disertations, there is a progress in the academic and professional standards reflected by the use of PP-frames.

The developmental features observed may stem from Chinese EFL student writers gradual improvement in their genre awareness of disciplinary writing and increased exposure to the use of academic formulaic language assciated with their field, preparing themselves for more appropriate utilization of PP-frames in disciplinary writing.

Academic discourse socialization refers to the novice academic writers' development of academic literacy and linguistic and cultural competence to gain acces to the academic discourse community (Duff, 007). As these writers stive to socialize themselves into the targt academic discourse norms, ther ability to master and strategicall utilie thir linguistic reources in academic writing is found to be shaped, if not constrained, by their prior academic experiences.

At the undergraduate level, English courses mainly target at core knowledge, such as cultural awareness, literature study and critical thinking, along with language-related training in EFL listning, speaking, reading, writing and translating sills. However, there is a limited emphasis on the cultivation of scientific research capacities, such as English academic reading and writing. In contrast, postgraduate study offers master's students extensive training in academic litracy in the discipline and provides more opportunities for academic writing experiences, leading to familiarity with the language features in academic writing. P-frames, as a frequently occurring type of formulaic expressions in academic discourse (Biber, 2009, p. 284), are particularl noteworthy for their high frequency and potential to be bettr learned and effectively used. For doctoral students, advancements in academic literacy and disciplinary knowledge are further encouraged. Nonetheless, there remains scope for improvement in terms of the appropriate se. lection of fllers in the patten of IVS, since even Chinese EFL student writers at the PhD level may be hindered by a lack f in-depth knowledge of phraseology, as noted by Benelhadj (2019).

Upon revisiting the more prevalent referential discourse functions and organizing functions, i i evident that their usage in PhD dissertations is considerably more frequent than in RAs. This observation cooborates Benelhadj's (2019, p. 194) finding that PhD dissertations i socil sciences preer specifi PP-frames that are decribed as familia xpressions which are nt exclusive to aademic writing" (Cortes, 2004, p. 414). These formulaic expressons serve as aconduit for \*engaging with a literature, providing warrants, connecting ideas, directing readers around the text, and specifying limitations" (Hyland, 2008b, p. 16). The observed incremental adoption of PP-frames to express reerential meanings, particularly those as intangibl framing atributes, eflect the improvement of professional competence. It also plays an important role in shaping a disciplinary discourse, establishing subject-specific knowledge, and negotiating various stances in the discourse through the strategic use of PP-frames.

Once again, it has to be recognized that there are differences in academic specificity between PhD dissertations and RAs. For example, RA writer often use intangible framing attributes o explore the trths and fat, as indicated by the P-frame by the fact \*, or to indicate the relationships or changes in relationships between variable, as see in the PP-frames in relation to \* and of the variance \* In contrast, PhD dserations typically emphasizecausal relatios, a reflected y the P-frame in order to\*, and make reference to the discourse in context, as demonstrated by in/of the present \* and in the following \*.

In a sense, the variations appear to correspond to the differences in the target readership between Chinese EFL theses and dis sertations and RAs. For instance, statistical data indicate that the PP-frames used for topic elaborationsecond only to the most frequently used PP-frames in theses and dissertations--constitute the largest proportion in BA theses $( 1 8 . 2 \% )$ among the four corpora. The prevalence of these PP-frames then diminishes through MA theses $( 1 0 . 2 \% )$ and PhD dissertations $( 7 . 8 \% )$ , albeit remaining in greater use than in RAs $( 5 . 8 \% )$ . This is because thesis writers tend to provide more explicit explanations than RA writers (Swales, 2004) due to diffrent lel of expertise Specifically, the redership of RAs consists of academic peers in the feld who posses shared tacit nowledge while reders of thes and disertations comprises the Thesis Review ommitee. Mre extensiveelaborations on th opic can assis student writersin refining their discourse and effectively addressing potentia inquiries from the committe in the review process (Benelhadj, 2019. In summary, reader awareness may shed light on why Chinese EFL student writers exhibit an over-reliance on PP-frames in both overal frequencies and specific subfunctions, despite having achieved a high level of academic literacy.

# 6. Conclusion

This exploratory study on the overall use, grammatical paterns and functional characteristic of P-frames by Chinese EFL student writers across Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral levels in the field of Applied Linguistics revealed a growing tendency in the overal frequency of PP-frame usag. It has aso highlightedtrajectory in lexicogrammatical diversty, alongide the emergence f functional features that are increasingly tailored to specific academic genres and disciplinary conventions. The study's outcomes have provided evidence for a robust connection between academic literacy progression of Chinese EFL student writers and their phraseological competence. The results in the overalluse and grammatical patterns indicate that those with a higher degree of academic liter. acy-namely, PhD student writers with extensive writing experience and exposure to the target P-framesproduce higher numbers and more variable sets of PP-frames than their counterparts at an earlier stage of academic literacy, such as BA student writers in the present research. The findings also revealed a consistent upward trend in the deployment of referential PP-frames, particularly specification of intangible atributes, contrast and comparison, and deictics and locatives. This trend is observed to cater for the communicative demands inherent in academic writing, serving to elucidate arguments, invoke and integrate prior scholarship, and persuade the readers, among other discursive functions. Discourse organizing P-frames were also discerned to function as the textual bridge, efectively forging functional links between preceding and subsequent propositions. Their trategic deployment enhances the fabric of discourse by imbuing it with a seamless logic and coherence, thus knitting together the argumentative threads of the discourse.

PP-frames, while perhaps not as psychologicall salient as lexical bundles due to their seemingly discontinuous structure, are of significant teaching worthiness It isther communicative unctions that motivate learning (Ells & Fereira-Junior, 2009. Recognizing PP-frames as partiall-filled multi-word constructions (Liu, 2012) esentially transforms our understanding of PP-frames; they are not reall discontinuous in nature. Insted, the associated discourse functions augment ther structural completeness and functionality, as evidenced by the current reearch. Thus, compiling a ist of high-freuency P-frames could effectively highlight these phrases for both teachers and leaners in EAP pedagogy. For instance, the P-frame as/for a/an/the \* of is useful when presented as a multi-word construction "as/of $^ +$ det (determiner) $^ +$ NP(noun phrase) + of', where "det $+ \mathrm { \Delta N P ^ { * } }$ could schematically represent any noun phrase starting with an article. According to Ellis (2008), when language acquisition is viewed from a contemporary cognitive inguistic theory, it is seen as usage-based construction learning. Moreover, abstract and discontinuous constructions appear to be more productive in the learning process than structurally complete lexical bundles (Liu, 2012).

Furthermore, the study underscores the necesity for explicit instruction of the cros-linguistic ifferences in the semantic meanings of prepositions between English and Chinese For example the P-frame duringthe \*of indicates an action occurring concurrently with another throughout the period, whereas in the \* of suggests an action in progress. This temporal distinction, present in English prepositions, may not be as clear as in Chinese PP-frame zai \* zhong ( ..) when denoting time. An explicit instruction that contrasts the semantic meanings of prepositions in both languages may contribute to a better comprehension of P-frames.

The findings also offer pedagogical insights for EAP instructors, suggesting that they conduct genre analyses of BA and MA theses, PhD dissertations, and RAs in order to compare and contrst the usage of PP-frames. A discussion of the deployment of P-frames and how to introduce variablefillers can enhance the student writers genre awarenes and help them grasp the grammatical patterns of PP-frames. It i important to note that discontinuous formulas such as P-frames in the current study should become \*an interal part of pedagogicall oriented lists of academic formulaic expressions (Lu et al, 2021), thus enriching the student writers use of phraseological language in EAP writing.

Proper use of P-frames constitutes a hallmark in the development of academic literacy and acculturation into academic discourse community for EFL student writers Duff 2010). Therefore, it is imperative for EFL student writers to enhance their academic literacy by actively engaing in academic activities, such as meticlous litrature rding and practice f academic writing, in order to improve their phraseological competence in EAP writing. Such improvement i facilitated by pertinent linguistic input and the expansion of exposure to academic language usage.
