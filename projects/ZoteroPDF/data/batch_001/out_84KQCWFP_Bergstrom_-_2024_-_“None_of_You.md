Collaborative writing tasks are common in multilingual university-level writing-intensive classes, but how multilingual language learners (MLLs) are socialized into this group work as a discursive practice is still poorly understood. This case study of adult MLLs in multilingual writing classes at a large public university provides insight into how this socialization can conflict with teaching goals. Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA), a micro-analytic approach, is used to investigate how students inter-subjectively assemble categories of identity in order to articulate their understanding of collaborative writing tasks and how they are obligated to negotiate them. Analysis of classroom talk reveals a conflict between student articulations of how to perform writing tasks when they interact with one another as group members and when they interact individually with instructors. Implications and a possible pedagogical intervention for the framing of collaborative writing tasks are discussed.

# INTRODUCTION

Collaborative writing tasks are ubiquitous in composition classes at the university level and their benefits have long been accepted in Composition Studies (LeFevre 1987; Syverson 1999; Fontaine and Hunter 2006; Lunsford and Ede 2012; Duffy 2021). Commonly cited benefits include increased awareness of writing as a social act (Bruffee 1984), increased ability to articulate and reflect on one’s writing choices (Elbow 1999), and a synergistic pooling of expertise (Ede and Lunsford 1983). Such tasks are also a staple of writing classes for multilingual language learners (MLLs), with documented benefits in task success and grammatical accuracy (Storch 2005, 2008; Swain 2006; Storch and Wigglesworth 2007; Shehadeh 2011; Fernández Dobao and Blum 2013). However, little research has been done on how MLLs are socialized into academic small group collaborative writing as an interactional practice. Given how widely such tasks are used by teachers, there is a need for greater understanding of how MLLs develop a sense of how this social interaction is locally accomplished.

To this end, I suggest Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) (Sacks 1992; Lepper 2000) as a valuable approach for investigating the phenomenon of collaborative writing in participants’ own terms. MCA affords a means of investigating how learners inter-subjectively assemble categories of identity for the purpose of making sense of a collaborative writing situation. Analyses of data excerpts from a case study of socialization in collaborative writing among MLLs in a first-year composition course will be used to illustrate the way in which this occurs. Special attention is paid to how articulated understandings of a task can shift as categories of identity shift. I argue that a learner’s co-constructed understanding of a task in the context of one identity in relationship with others may conflict with or be replaced by an understanding tied to a different identity they perform in relation to someone else. These shifts in interactionally constructed identities can result in understandings of how to do collaborative writing work that run counter to an instructor’s target outcomes for these tasks. I conclude with an evaluation of MCA as a tool for studying collaborative writing as well as preliminary recommendations for how to bring learners’ development of collaborative writing as a social practice into greater alignment with teachers’ goals for collaborative writing.

# COLLABORATIVE WRITING AS A SOCIAL PRACTICE WITH MATERIAL DIMENSIONS

In the field of Applied Linguistics, collaborative writing has been defined as a group writing task in which ‘there is a shared and negotiated decision making process and shared responsibility for the production of a single text’ (Storch 2013: 3). Such a definition places collaborative learning squarely within the context of social practice in that writing decisions are made through deliberation between group members. The benefit of Storch’s definition is that, by limiting collaboration to texts produced through an interactional process involving the mutual efforts of co-authors who identify themselves as such, it does not conflate the ‘social’, in general, with the specifically ‘collaborative’.1 Much of the research into collaborative writing has thus been focused on the negotiation between learners to achieve consensus on issues relating to language use and the best means of expressing meaning (see Storch 2019 for an outline of this literature). Empirical studies have tended to analyze such negotiation in terms of a quantifiable unit, the Language Related Episode (LRE), talk in which learners attend to ‘language they are producing, question their language use, or correct themselves or others’ (Swain and Lapkin 1998: 326).

While this research, focused on quantity and content of LREs, has been valuable in identifying the benefits of this kind of group work in successfully completing writing tasks that may result in language learning, it pays less attention to how this kind of talk is produced. Such an approach is well-suited to studies investigating collaborative writing in educational contexts where grammatical accuracy is a particularly important factor and a frequent topic of negotiation between group members (see e.g., Kowal and Swain 1994; Storch 1998; Swain and Lapkin 2001; Kessler 2009; Shehadeh 2011). It may be less useful in contexts where the learning goal of a lesson is not the consistent performance of a targeted syntactic form but, instead, analysis or invention of argument. In such cases, how group members cooperate to make sense of what they are supposed to do and what constitutes successful task completion becomes a more significant problem as there is no single optimal answer towards which a group is working. This is where a micro-analytic approach is useful in illuminating how students are socialized into academic small group collaborative writing such that they are able to arrive at consensus decisions regarding the completion of group writing tasks.

In addition to linguistic interactional resources, this study also attends to the material effects of embodied forms of interactional meaning-making as well as technologies of literacy. Many studies of collaborative writing have investigated the role played by technology, particularly web-based software, such as wikis and Google Docs in collaborative writing interaction (cf. Li 2018 for an analysis of this research). As welcome and as useful as they are, they tend to focus exclusively on online interaction. When these technologies are used for in-class collaborative writing, however, not only the software but the hardware on which it runs become elements of a complex ecology involving humans and machines interacting in both online and embodied ways. The material dimensions of literacy as a social practice have been the focus of growing attention in studies of literacy (Brandt and Clinton 2002) and composition (Blair 1999; Sheridan et al. 2005; Duffy 2014). Again, this seems a place where microanalytic approaches, attending to gesture, manipulation of objects, and interactions between humans and machines, can provide some insight into complex writing situations.

# METHODOLOGY

This study draws on Membership Categorization Analysis, an ethnomethodololgical analytical approach initially developed by Harvey Sacks (1992) and emerging out of the Conversation Analysis program he pioneered with Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson. MCA examines how we are able to negotiate what is meant by what other people say through the use of ‘membership category devices’. Such a device is the mechanism by which we deduce relationships between collections of categories of people and activities that are bound to those categories. These activities, called category-bound activities (CBA), are actions that can be used by participants in conversation to infer what membership category is being constructed in any given situation. Collections, categories, and CBAs are not fixed bodies of cultural knowledge independent of their context but created in the moment to make sense of what is happening in an interaction (Hester and Hester 2012). As Georgia Lepper (2000) notes, membership category devices are culturally specific constructions that often contain categories linked by relationships that carry certain privileges and obligations. Such categories are referred to as ‘standardized relational pairs’ (SRP).

This is an especially valuable approach in investigating how learners negotiate collaborative writing tasks because it affords a means of showing how they infer what they are obligated to do in the context of such work. Many educational activities in classrooms involve a teacher providing students with instructions for a task. Understanding of how to execute a task is an interactional achievement worked out between participants, with the teacher playing a key role (Mondada 2011). Categorization is of special relevance to collaborative writing because the categories assembled between teacher and learner in the interaction in which the task is presented can be quite different from those assembled among writing group members in the interaction in which it is executed. As learners leave the context of one standard relational pair, that of teacher-student, another may become more salient, group member-group member. The activities that are then bound to the categories in this pair may involve working with the text in a way that differs significantly from those bound to the category of student created by the talk of the teacher.

# DATA

# Participants

This study was conducted at a large research university in the Pacific Northwest. Research participants were recruited from a first-year composition class for multilingual learners in which MLL students were regularly presented with texts and then asked to discuss them in class as well as work in groups to produce texts of their own about them. Among these participants, four focal participants were recruited for further interviews outside of the classroom. There was a broad spectrum of experiences covered by these participants, running from students who had spent less than a year in the United States and had studied English as a foreign language to those who had been raised in the US and had spent the great majority of their educational careers there. While this class was specifically designed for students who identified as multilingual, this linguistic diversity was a typical feature of all composition courses at the university. The course was offered within the institution’s expository writing program and was taken to fulfill the school’s composition requirement for all undergraduate students. The main purpose of the course was to develop students’ abilities to read, analyze, and write argument-driven academic papers. The teacher was a doctoral student from the People’s Republic of China who described Mandarin Chinese as her first language, with English as a second language studied in EFL classes in China. She had many years’ experience teaching English as a foreign language in Beijing, but this was her first year teaching English composition at a US university. The class met two days each week for $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ each session over the course of an academic quarter lasting 10 weeks. Collaborative writing activities were used in almost all class meetings, with the teacher generally providing a task with instructions and then dividing the class into groups of three or four. Typically, though not always, groups were later asked to read aloud or summarize the writing they produced to the teacher and the rest of the class.

# Data

Participants were recruited in the first week of class. Focal participants who agreed to meet outside of class for interviews were compensated with Amazon gift cards. The class was visited a total of twelve times during the academic quarter. Data sources include semi-structured interview audio recordings with focal participants, classroom observation field notes, classroom interaction video recordings, classroom small group interaction audio recordings, and textual artifacts such as educational materials, student-produced writing, and teacher-produced writing. Using multiple data sources was employed as a means of mapping the range and complexity of literacy practices. The meaning of these practices and how participants understood them is considered in this study as a collaborative achievement in which meaning is negotiated and knowledge co-constructed between participants (Talmy 2010).

The following data excerpts have been selected to illustrate the role categorization played in the interactive work that participants did to make sense of a collaborative writing task. They also demonstrate how useful MCA as an approach is in documenting how discrepancies can arise between protocols for performing a task that are constructed between a teacher and students and those subsequently negotiated between students in small groups. Transcription conventions are based on those developed by Gail Jefferson (1989) and simplified by ten Have (2007). Excerpts from video data are transcribed in a manner adapted from conventions used by Lorenza Mondada (2012).

# ANALYSIS

The following data excerpts document a collaborative writing task. Prior to the class meeting, the teacher has assigned reading to students from a textbook about composition and rhetoric. The reading describes the elements of what it calls a ‘complex claim’ as it is used in argument-driven writing: stakes, evidence, counterclaim, claim, roadmap. During the class meeting, the teacher called on students to summarize different parts of this reading. Then she passed out a piece of paper on which was printed an opinion-editorial from a local newspaper. She asked students to read the article silently to themselves after which, she asked them to look for the article’s ‘complex claim,’ as this term was defined in the reading they did in the textbook and which was just discussed in class. As they read, she emailed an invitation link to her class email list, allowing them to access and edit a document that she created using Google Docs and that was stored on her Google Drive. Following a ten-minute break, she asked students to count off by five and then arrange themselves in groups. The groups were instructed to open the Google Doc and answer the questions listed for their group using the analytical terms about claims from their reading. Group Five, featured in the excerpts below, has been assigned the following questions in the Google Doc:

# EXTRACT 1. GROUP 5 ROAD MAP PROMPTS

# Group 5: road map

1. What is the function of the road map in a formal written essay?   
2. Could you draw a road map for this article?

The analytic focus for the excerpts that follow is on the construction of categories and the responsibilities and obligations of members with relation to the interactional achievement of an articulated understanding of how to execute the collaborative writing task. As will be described in the analysis that follows, these obligations shift as categories assembled in talk and the actions bound to them shift. The talk in this exchange is occurring within the context of a classroom and bears the characteristics of such institutional interaction. While it does not follow the question-and-answer pattern of Initiation-ResponseEvaluation identified as being most typical of classroom talk (Sinclair and Coulthard 1975; Mehan 1979; Drew and Heritage 1992; MacBeth 2004; Lee 2007), that is because the pedagogical purpose of group work is different from that of a more traditional teacher-fronted lecture. The organization of classroom talk will vary depending on the pedagogical focus, such that students will engage in interaction somewhat more like conversation in some activities, such as pair work and group work, and then flexibly return to an IRE pattern for others (Markee and Kasper 2004; Richards 2006; Seedhouse 2004, 2005). While the identities of teacher and student remain available at all times, they should not be assumed to be omni-relevant, because, as I will argue, roles can shift depending on the activity participants recognize they are involved in. It is the categorization work of the participants that allows them to infer when such a shift in activity has been made and how to construct social order in the new context.

5 S4:

While members in this extract do not use the word ‘group’, the collection, ‘group’ is accessible to them after the teacher informs them that they will be working in groups and they count off by five, group their chairs into a circle, open the Google Doc, and find the words ‘Group Five: Road Map’ awaiting them (Extract 1). The hand gesture that I make in line 1 and my reference to ‘here’ establishes that this space including the four participants constitutes its own unit. Furthermore, when I confirm with S2 that I can record their conversation, I am gazing at him, but S1 and S4 are also turning their gazes on me in response, and it is S1 who gives verbal confirmation (line 2). Charles Goodwin (1980, 1981) has found that recipients of a speaker’s talk gaze at the speaker when that speaker is addressing them, and S1’s response to my question directed at S2 indicates that the question is hearable as addressed to the entire group. Thus, even though I am directing my gaze towards S2 when I ask if it is still acceptable for me to record, S1 responds as a recipient of my talk and on behalf of the group.

The exchange that follows in lines 4–5 reveals that there are actions bound to the category of group member performing a collaborative writing task. S2 reacts to the introduction of the recording device in line 1 by stating to S1 that now they really do have to observe the obligations of their category, namely that of being ‘on task,’ suggesting that if they were not being observed, they might simply shirk that obligation. The accompanying laughter signals that $S 2 ^ { \prime } s$ criticism of S1’s willingness to be recorded is a joke, and S4 responds with laughter of her own. This joke is indicative of the tension created by the anomalous introduction of a researcher into a social context where usually no such interactant is present. It also indicates that being ‘on task’ is an activity associated with being a member of a student group. Here, this association constitutes a category-bound activity, which Elizabeth Stokoe describes as an action that is ‘in situ linked to categories’ (Stokoe 2012: 281). The rhetorical effect of my presence and that of the iPad recording their talk is that the responsibilities of being a group member are rendered particularly salient for this group: they have a task to perform, and their talk is intended to be a means of performing that task. Indeed, they are accountable in more ways than one. Not only does their categorization work obligate them to be on task, they are also being observed and recorded by a researcher, and the text they are producing is being projected onto a pull-down screen at the front of the classroom.

# EXTRACT 3: A SHIFT IN STANDARDIZED RELATIONAL PAIRS

This next extract, following directly after the interaction described above, is presented to show a shift in standardized relational pairs that occurs when a teacher enters the interaction. Participants begin by invoking a standardized relational pair of group member-to-group member to negotiate how they should complete their task. When they encounter a difficulty, they solicit help from the teacher. When the teacher enters the interaction, she makes relevant a new standardized relational pair, that of teacher-to-student that changes the participants’ articulated understanding of how to approach their writing task.

As soon as they open the Google Doc, members turn their attention to the problem of how to negotiate this task and the first part of this process involves categorization work. S1 reads out the first three words of the prompt which does the work of both naming participants as members of a group as well as identifying their task (line 1). S1’s hailing of members in this way is received by S4 as a call to answer the first question, part of which she paraphrases in line 2. As in Extract 1, a collection, ‘group’ with the category, ‘members’ is assembled, and an activity associated with that category. By rephrasing part of the prompt as a question addressed to group members, S4 is proposing that their task will be fulfilled by answering the questions in the prompt.

As mentioned above, the teacher has contextualized this activity by saying to the class that it involves drawing on their knowledge of the newspaper opinion-editorial they have just read as well as the reading from the textbook they were assigned as homework in the previous class. However, within the context of the collaborative writing task performed by group members who identify themselves as such, not all of these instructions are interpreted as being relevant or necessary. S1 and S4 indicate that they have not read the assigned parts of the textbook that define what a ‘roadmap’ is with relation to a ‘complex claim’ (lines 8–9). It is notable that within the context of the student group, group members do not find their failure to take up an assigned educational text as something for which they must account. Thus, reading assigned texts is not an obligation for group members; they are simply responsible for completing their task with whatever means they have at hand. S2 attempts to meet this responsibility by using Google to search for an answer (line 11), and when this does not bear fruit, he suggests a definition, indicating uncertainty through hedging (‘I think’)

(lines 3–4, 11, 13). S3 contributes to this effort by attempting to find a definition of the term ‘roadmap’ in her textbook (line 10). While S4 expresses interest in whether a definition can be found in the textbook, she turns to the teacher as a faster, more expedient way to accomplish the group’s task (line 14–15). That this option is open to S4 suggests, again, that while mastery of course content, reading assigned texts, or spending time finding definitions in books may be ways of meeting a group’s obligations, they are not necessarily preferable; the speedy accomplishment of the task trumps how it is accomplished.

This ends-not-means approach encounters a hard limit, however, when the Teacher (T), enters the conversation and a different collection becomes salient, that of ‘class,’ the members of which include the SRP of ‘teacher-student.’ When S4 first speaks to the teacher, she uses the first-person plural: ‘we don’t really know what is a roadmap’ (line 15). The ‘group’ collection is still being invoked here: the group needs help to accomplish its task. At first, the teacher acknowledges S4’s request (line 20) within the context of group work. She bends toward a different group member, S1, and points out the question addressed to Group 5 as it appears on the pull-down screen at the front of the classroom (line 19). However, when she asks S4 if she has done the assigned reading (lines 20), note how S4 shifts from the first-person plural to the singular in her response: ‘yeah no I did it like last week’ (line 21). The question is not hearable as being addressed to all members of the group but specifically to her such that her answer must be confined to an account of her actions. Also, her failure to take up the assigned text has become, within the context of this interaction, something that must be justified. An account must be supplied because, within the relationship of teacher-student, the student is obligated to read assigned texts. S4’s statement that she has not read the textbook is ‘accountable’ in the sense that it is hearable as requiring explanation (Sacks 1992: 4–6). When S4 and S1 initially mention that they have not read this section of the textbook (lines 8–9), these statements are not heard as accountable, thus no explanation or excuse is given. In the context of teacher–student, however, when the teacher asks if the student has read the text, the student’s response is oriented to the teacher’s, such that it can be seen as ‘complying with the requirements’ of her question (Lee 1987: 37). In this case, the requirement includes a justification of her not having read the assigned text. As Derek Edwards has observed, in classroom talk, ‘participants’ interactional categories are revealed in what they treat as accountable, as requiring explanation, excuse, demonstration, a change of mind, or further information’ (Edward 1997: 38). In this case, the student’s obligation to the teacher does not end with simply reading: the student is also expected to have some recall of that reading. If she cannot claim mastery of the content, this must be explained. Yes, she has done the reading; no, she does not remember it; her inability to recall it is understandable because she read it some time ago.

Similarly, S1 must now account for his failure to take up the assigned reading. While the teacher turns her head to look at multiple group members in line 24 and uses the second person plural in line 25, it is hearable as a question addressed to each student individually. S1 does not speak for the group in his account. Thus, he explains that, while he read some of the text, he did not get to the section defining the ‘roadmap’ of a ‘complex claim’ (line 26, 28). Here, we see a significant conflict of categories and the activities associated with them. This was not a category-bound activity within the collaborative writing group, but it is one within the context of the teacher-student relationship. This shows how understanding of how to perform the collaborative writing task is dependent upon the identities being constructed in the moment by students for themselves that might not be visible if we assumed stable teacher and student identities to obtain in all classroom interactions.

The teacher has been interacting with each member of the group within the context of a teacher–student relationship that does not invoke the collection of the group, but this changes when she needs to indicate that the participants’ excuses are not acceptable in this context. S1’s account for not doing the reading—at least I read some of it; I read it, but that was a long time ago—might be acceptable within the confines of the teacher-student SRP. However, it is at this moment that the teacher makes the group category freshly relevant, activating the responsibilities particular to it: ‘but unfortunately you are in group five heh’ (line 29). S1 and S4 find themselves caught in a bind: as students with relationship to a teacher, they are responsible for reading the text; as group members they are responsible for completing the particular task that is before them. They may have a reasonable justification as students for not having fulfilled their obligation to read the text such that they are able to deploy their knowledge of it in a writing task. However, as members of a group they still have a duty to find the means for acquiring that knowledge and demonstrating it in a manner called for by the task prompt. S4 responds with laughter in line 30, in recognition of how they have been cornered. There has been a contest here over how to interpret this situation. Are we students accountable individually to the teacher for our understanding of how to address the task or are we members of a group accountable to one another? The teacher, as the participant with the greatest power in this interaction has the authority to choose which set of obligations is most likely to prevail.

The teacher’s invocation of the group collection in line 29 sponsors a very specific understanding of how to approach group work. This is an interpretation of the group’s obligations in which participants must identify the reading assigned from the textbook as a resource to be employed in the completion of the task. It is not sufficient, however, to simply state that they are obligated to use the textbook and leave the group to act on this instruction. She must then provide another layer of interpretation that directs their attention to each step of how the textbook must be used. In lines 22–4, she physically points out the section of the text defining ‘roadmap.’ Note, however, that S4 does not actually take up the text in this way and begin reading it aloud until line 33, after the group’s responsibilities as a group are made salient to this situation. The manner in which those responsibilities can be operationalized is presented in line 32, when the teacher says that the group can ‘give like brief summary of that part’. The group adopts this preferred uptake, reading the text aloud and then working out their summary (lines 38–42).

After the teacher leaves the interaction in line 33, the remaining participants quickly reassert the collection of the group and take up the prompt both as a task to be completed as well as a means of affiliating and commiserating with one another. Group members raise the topics of their own prior knowledge and the difficulty of their task in a way that serves the purpose of justifying the approach they took as a group before the teacher’s intervention. In lines 43–44, S1 and S2 state that ‘roadmap’ in this case refers to something like an outline, something of which they assert they were already aware but simply did not know the special term for. Here, this affiliation between group members is made by taking a certain stance towards their task that reinforces shared knowledge and experience: we already kind of knew this; we just were not aware of the terminology. Here, ‘affiliation,’ refers to the practice of establishing social solidarity, generally by taking a stance in relation to a range of actions, such as requests, offers, or evaluations performed by a prior speaker (Heritage 1984). Affiliation is often established by a second speaker after such an action is performed by delivering a preferred response or, at least formatting a dispreferred response in a manner that minimizes any potential damage to social solidarity (Pomerantz 1984; Sacks 1987; Pomerantz and Heritage 2013). Thus, when S1 makes his evaluation in line 43, S2 delivers a preferred response that establishes solidarity, by agreeing with that evaluation in line 44. Similarly, when S4 notes ruefully that it seems like theirs is the most difficult prompt (line 45), S2 responds with laughter (line 46), a common affiliative action (Sacks 1974; Jefferson et al. 1987). It is not hard to see $S 4 ^ { \prime } s$ point. All the other groups have questions that ask them to define a term and then locate an example of it in the article, such as evidence used in support of a claim or a concession in an argument. Theirs is the only question that asks them to synthesize information rather than simply identify it: ‘Could you draw a road map for this article?’

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this interaction is the manner in which the category-bound actions of group members do not always align with those of an individual student with relation to the teacher. This discrepancy has implications for how students operationalize the instructions they receive for completing a collaborative writing task. The writing activity described here comes just after students have written their first extended essay, the focus of which was crafting a complex argument of the sort described in their textbook. The entire class period was spent on activities related to complex claims and their papers, with parts of activities referencing readings from the textbook that had been assigned to acquaint them with threshold concepts of the course. The actions constructed as being associated with group members, however, constrained students’ ability to meet the lesson outcome of developing their awareness of what a complex claim is and how one is put together through analysis of a short argument. Through the intervention of the teacher, the group ultimately articulates an understanding of the task that involves paraphrasing sources and creating a reverse outline of the text. These are certainly skills that could be useful in developing the awareness targeted by this exercise. However, participants did not articulate an understanding of the task that related it to the larger concerns of the lesson and the course; they approached it as a discrete operation with little relevance to anything else. Group members in this interaction tended to cooperate in approaching collaborative writing as a task to be completed quickly and by any means at hand. The teacher must guide them, breaking their task into smaller, more specific, tasks, each of which must be explicitly sponsored: she points out where in the textbook the relevant definition is to be found and then suggests paraphrase and summary as the appropriate procedures to employ. Once she leaves, however, the group’s talk about the task is focused not on the new skills they have practiced but on how they did not learn something new. They express their difficulty with the task as stemming from a kind of technicality. The understanding of collaborative writing tasks that is reinforced here is one in which the focus is on the optimal shortest path to a given task’s completion rather than on developing skills that can be applied to many tasks. If a teacher creates a lesson targeting the latter, then the pedagogical implication is that they may need to draw learners’ attention to this in a way that remains relevant in the context of group work.

# IMPLICATIONS

# Methodological implications

The benefits of micro-analytic approaches such as MCA in studying collaborative writing have been twofold. First, by considering social order as a local achievement and focusing on literacy practices that occur in the context of classroom activity, it has been possible to analyze collaborative writing tasks as a participants’ concern. This enables us to consider how students develop an understanding of how to do this work through social interaction without making assumptions about their inner cognitive states. Instead, we are able to follow how their own articulated understandings of the task are used to negotiate that task. This was of interest in the excerpts presented above because the operationalization of the instructions given for the task proved a significant obstacle for this group, requiring the intervention of the teacher. Second, the granular level of detail involved in this analysis has afforded access into the assembly of categories of identity between participants moment by moment. This, in turn, allows us to investigate how categories of identity and the relationships co-constructed between learners engaged in collaborative writing have a powerful shaping influence on how they do this kind of work. As we observed, this categorization work among learners resulted in a conflict between how they understood their task and how their teacher wanted them to understand it. Without considering the role of categorization, the reasons for this conflict may have remained obscure. After all, even if the students had forgotten to do the reading, they could have easily used the index in the textbook or the page numbers assigned to them as reading in the preceding class to find the information they needed to complete the task in the manner the teacher intended. An examination of the activities and obligations associated with being a group member in this interaction allowed us to see why this option may not have been salient to participants. As group members who are obligated to complete the task quickly but not necessarily to do assigned reading, simply asking the teacher to give them the answer was, for the group, a reasonable and expedient alternative. That this tended to defeat the teacher’s purpose in having them perform this exercise was relevant only to the teacher herself. A discussion of the pedagogical implications of this interaction follows.

# Pedagogical implications

If, as educators, we find that the categories habitually constructed by learners in collaborative writing tasks shape their understanding of how to do them in ways that run counter to our educational goals, then we may need to draw their attention to this fact. Bethan Benwell and Elizabeth Stokoe have suggested that ‘acknowledging that students are not only ‘doing education’ but also ‘doing being students’ in ways that sometimes appear resistant, contradictory or ambivalent may prove valuable in the development of materials to facilitate their induction into higher education’ (Benwell and Stokoe 2005: 139). This may mean considering how to make the relationships that we talk into being a focus of classwork in their own right. Thus, before we engage in some activity that is bound to a category, such as group work or peer review, we may first need to open a space in which the class may discuss what this activity is, what it is for, how they have done it in the past, and what results they have had. By making these activities the focus of in-class discussion and examination, learners and teachers can make conscious decisions about how they might modify the way in which they engage in these interactions to achieve lesson outcomes. Thus, instead of presenting instructions and asking them to interpret them on their own, the teacher is negotiating a protocol for the task at hand with students. After this protocol is developed and students try it out in the context of the writing task, the class can debrief to discuss how successful this approach was in achieving the pedagogical goals of the task. Further research into how effective such interventions might be in aligning learners’ articulated understandings of how to do collaborative writing with lesson goals is needed.

# CONCLUSION

Through this examination of data from a case study of learners engaged in a collaborative writing task, I have traced how their categorization work plays a significant role in shaping their understanding of how to perform the task. A case study is necessarily limited to the unique qualities of a phenomenon in a particular context such that its results are not generalizable. However, case studies, because of their attention to the nuances of a phenomenon serve a useful role in developing or complexifying theory and methodological approaches. While a single case may not be generalizable to all cases, it can expand our understanding of what is possible in such cases. This study offers new insight into how students approach collaborative writing tasks in which the skills targeted are argument analysis and invention. It also provides an illustration of the power of microanalytic approaches like MCA in describing and explaining complex interactions in educational contexts.

to which writing as a social phenomenon is intrinsically collaborative (see Duffy 2014 for a brief review).
