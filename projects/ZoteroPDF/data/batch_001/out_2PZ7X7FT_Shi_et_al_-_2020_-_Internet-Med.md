Abstract—Background: As all sorts of communications have substantially moved to the internet, volumes of literature on internet-mediated communication have emerged in professional and technical communication in different research paradigms, including studies on internet-mediated genres, which often have generic features beyond traditional conception and thus require updated understanding. This study systematically explores the emerging body of internet-mediated genre studies and identifies the specific genres that researchers have studied, the analytical components and research methods used, and conclusions reached to characterize the current state of the research. Research questions: 1. Which internet-mediated genres have been studied in existing literature (2005-2019)? 2. What affordances have been considered in existing studies on internet-mediated genres? 3. Which research methods have been used to study internet-mediated genres? Literature review: Major issues affecting prior studies of internet-mediated genres include inconsistent terminology used by researchers, the ways that affordances are considered, and the inadequacies of current genre analysis methods to explain features arising from those affordances. Methodology: Employing an integrative literature review, we conducted a systematic search resulting in 35 qualified studies published in journals indexed in the Social Sciences Citation Index between 2005 and 2019. Each was systematically analyzed to identify the genre addressed, communicative goal, medium, affordances addressed, and research methods used. Results/discussion: Three main types of internet-mediated genres—including email, website, and social media, and several subtypes—were identified, each distinguished by their medium and communicative goal. The affordances were either treated monomodally, mentioned as contextual information, or integrated into the analytical framework. Researchers relied on a variety of methods to study internet-mediated genres, with mixed methods most commonly used. Conclusions and further research: The data show that both the genres of interest and methods used to study them vary with time, suggesting that this area of research continues to evolve. Future studies could probe into a larger variety of internet-mediated genres with more diverse analytical components and methods.

Index Terms—Affordances, genre analysis, internet-mediated genres.

In an increasingly digitally connected world, all sorts of communications have substantially shifted to the internet. The spheres of internet-mediated communication range from interpersonal, professional, academic, scientific, technical, and commercial, to journalistic, corporate, governmental, and political. Statistics show that roughly 281 billion emails were sent (and received)

per day in 2018, and the figure is expected to increase to over 347 billion daily mails by 2022 [1]. $\mathrm { I n } \ 2 0 1 8$ , an estimated 1.8 billion people worldwide purchased goods online, with global e-retail sales amounting to $\$ 2.8$ trillion USD and projected to grow up to $\$ 4.8$ trillion USD by 2021 [2]. Social media, the darling of the internet, is projected to reach 3.02 billion monthly active users by 2021, more than a third of the world’s entire population [3].

Along with this rapid development of communication through the internet, volumes of literature on internet-mediated communication have emerged in different research paradigms. Among them, studies of internet-mediated genres have captured a limited but increasing research interest in professional and technical communication. Some of the genres that have emerged online have counterparts in print, such as email (which serves functions similar to those of letters and memos), surveys [4] (which organizations can administer in print and online), and corporate websites [5] (which, at their most

# Practitioner Takeaway

For instructors who teach professional, busines, and/or technical witing: when addressing genre, especialy in internet-mediated contexts, focus on the affordances such as multimodalit, hypertextualit and functionalit in adition to language and discourse structure when teaching internet-mediated genres. For professional, business and/or technical communicators, become more aware of the generic features of diverse internet mediated genres, and draw on appropriate multimodal resources and other affordances to communicate effectively.

basic, replace corporate identity brochures). Other genres have emerged that do not have counterparts in print and that researchers in professional and technical communication have studied, including social networking sites [6]–[8]; blogs [9], [10]; and online user ratings [11], all of which have been explored by this journal in the past decade or so.

Internet-mediated genres often have the generic components that go beyond our traditional conceptions of genres in print media, and could require research methods and tools beyond those traditionally used to study and describe print genres. For example, traditional language-centered genre theories that have been used to analyze printed materials used in professional and technical communication [12]–[15] are challenged when analyzing internet-mediated genres [16] because much of the content on the internet is visual not textual. In other words, a synthesis of this emerging body of studies of internet-mediated genres might identify new genres and new research methods that could be of broader importance to studies on genre analysis, particularly on professional, technical, and business communication in the internet environment.

That is what this study is intended to do. Specifically, it intends to systematically explore the emerging body of internet-mediated genre studies and identify the specific internet-mediated genres that researchers have chosen to study, the analytical components and research methods that researchers have used, and the conclusions that researchers have reached about these genres, all with the aim of developing a broader characterization of the current state of this body of literature and its potential impact on the broader study of genres. The discussion starts by situating this study within the broader literature on genre studies, next describes the methodology used in our analysis, then presents the results, and closes with conclusions from the results, their limitations, and suggestions for future research.

# LITERATURE REVIEW

This section situates our study within the broader literature. It first provides a general overview of genre studies and next describes issues associated with internet-mediated genres. Then, this section summarizes challenges and concerns that have arisen in prior studies of internet-based genres in professional and technical communication, and concludes by suggesting a framework for considering the research on internet-mediated genres.

General Overview of Genre Studies The concept of genre has been traditionally rooted and well-established in various disciplines and fields. Carrying the French meaning “kind, sort, style,” genres traditionally serve to classify literary compositions (such as novels, poems, and prose), as well as visual and performing arts (such as painting, sculpture, music, dance, and theater). Since the “communicative turn” in genre theory in the 1960s, genres have been of interest to social sciences, including folklore studies, linguistic anthropology, and linguistics [17].

In nonliterary genre studies, three prominent traditions have been well-developed since the 1980s and widely recognized since the 1990s [18], [19]: English for Specific Purposes (ESP), Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), and New Rhetoric Studies (NRS). These three genre traditions are all pedagogy-oriented but take different paths. ESP and SFL are both theoretically and methodologically linguistics based; whereas NRS focuses more on the social, functional, and contextual aspects [20] [21], and the systems in which people use materials [22], and is most closely associated with professional and technical communication. Genre is defined as “a staged goal-oriented social process” in SFL [23, p. 13], and as “typified rhetorical actions based in recurrent social situation” by NRS scholars [20, p. 159]. In the ESP tradition, genre is referred to as

language use in a conventionalized communicative setting in order to give expression to a specific set of communicative goals of a disciplinary or social institution, which give rise to stable structural forms by imposing constraints on the use of lexico-grammatical as well as discoursal resources. [24, p. 23]

Toward the end of the 20th century, the notion of genre was introduced to studies of organizational communication, information systems, and professional and technical communication [25]–[28]. In organizational communication, genre refers to $^ { 6 } \mathrm { a }$ typified communicative action performed by members of an organizational community in recurrent social situations” [26, p. 50]. In information systems, it is regarded as “a classifying statement characterized by having similar content and form” [27, p. 97]. In professional and technical communication, genre is used to describe “situationally appropriate responses to recurrent situations” [21, p. 15] based on Miller’s definition [20], as well as the systems that generate the situations to which professionals respond, which Spinuzzi calls genre ecologies [22].

Since the start of the 21st century, genre studies have substantially transformed. They have expanded beyond print-based media to screen-based digital and online media, and extended from purely linguistic mode to visual modes [29]–[32]. These are called multimodality studies because they encompass a number of modes of communication. Multimodality scholarship has called for a multimodally extended notion of genre from linguistic models to any of the semiotic modes available in a medium [32, p. 10], and for updated analytical approaches more applicable to new media genres [31], [32].

# Challenges and Concerns That Have Arisen in Prior Studies of Internet-Mediated Genres

Several issues affect the study of genres distributed online. The first is terminology. Because genre analysis was introduced into studies on internet-mediated communication and discourse, a set of overlapping terms has been developed to address internet-mediated genres, including cybergenres [26], internet genres [33], digital genres, electronic genres, and web-mediated genres [16]. Because no standard terminology exists regarding online genres, we choose the term internet-mediated genres, defined here as recurrent goal-oriented communicative events and social

actions, with typically identifiable patterns in content, form, and structure, transmitted via the internet.

A second issue with the study of internet-mediated genres is the role of the medium. In Kress’s work [30], the new media age is represented by the shift from the medium of book and paper to the medium of screen. In the information systems literature, the World Wide Web is regarded as the main medium that “integrates various sub-mediums” [16, p. 125]. When researchers looked into internet-mediated genres, genres were sometimes confused with the media [34], [35], neglecting the fact that the communicative goal is the quintessence of a genre [16]. In her discussion on the relationship between blogs and genres, Giltrow proposes that media are “bridges-to-genres” [35, p. 49], which allow users in various spheres of activities to create differentiated genres. Therefore, it is proper to name internetmediated genres by combining their communicative goals with the medium—for example, sales emails, political blogs, governmental websites, and corporate tweets.

The contributions to internet-mediated genres by a technological medium are mainly made by what it allows for, namely, its affordances [36, p. 281]. An affordance is $^ { 6 6 } \mathrm { a }$ use or purpose that a thing can have, that people notice as part of the way they see or experience it” [37]. Internet-embedded media afford “properties of information and interaction that can be put to particular cognitive and communicative uses” [36, p. 281].

Multimodality, hypertextuality, and functionality are the representative affordances of the internet [16], [26], [38].

• Multimodality denotes “the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event, together with the particular way in which the modes are combined” [29, p. 20]. Semiotic modes, that is, “semiotic resources which allow the simultaneous realization of discourses and types of (inter)action” [29, p. 20], are rich on the internet, ranging from language, pictures, icons, and emoticons to animations, audios, and videos.   
• Hypertextuality refers to “the degree of interconnectivity of individual parts of the message in an extended chain of integrated content” [39, p. 93]. By clicking on any mode on a webpage, in a chat tool, or in an email— whether it is a word, a phrase, a sentence, a picture, or an animation—users leave the current

content for linked content elsewhere, whether on the same site or another one. • Functionality (sometimes called capabilities) refers to the technological functions of a medium, such as browsing, searching, interacting, discussing, and collaborating [26].

A third issue with the study of internet-mediated genres is methodology. When analyzing a purely linguistic or language-dominant genre, researchers usually follow this procedure.

1. Identify a genre by determining its communicative goal in a recurrent social situation.   
2. Collect instances of the genre.   
3. Analyze, qualitatively or quantitatively, the move structure, and linguistic features.   
4. Link discursive practices to contextual factors, including professional, social, cultural, political, and economic practices [22].

In move analysis, also called move/rhetorical/ macrostructure analysis, moves are semantic and functional units applied together to achieve the overall communicative goal of a genre [40, p. 24], and a move can sometimes be divided into several alternative steps that convey specific functional meanings.

The traditional genre analysis procedure described above has been challenged in studies on internet-mediated genre for its inadequacy to explain new genre features caused by the affordances of internet-embedded media. For language-dominant online genres, such as sales emails and consumer reviews, researchers can still conduct move analysis and linguistic analysis in the conventional way. For the other online genres that combine multiple modes or are visually dominant—containing hyperlinks or organized hypertextually, or relying on the technological functions of the medium—traditional language-focused genre analysis needs to be modified and adapted to explain new genre features. For example, recent studies on internet-mediated genres have examined how the communicative goals of group-buying websites and recruitment posts on the Chinese social media service Wechat are realized by language and visuals, as well as the technological functions of shopping websites and Wechat [41], [42].

# Framework for Analyzing Research on

Internet-Mediated Genres The literature, then, suggests that the following issues be considered when analyzing genre studies on internet-mediated genres. First is the communicative goal—that is, the main purpose the genre producers aim to accomplish. Next is the medium used. Third are applications of the affordances of the internet— multimodality, hypertextuality, and functionality—and their roles in realizing the communicative goal. Fig. 1 shows the relationships of these components.

Fig. 1. Framework for this integrative literature review.

Among them, the communicative goal and the medium used determine the types of internetmediated genres. The affordances indicate the means of information and interaction offered by the internet-meditated genres. Under the guidance of the theoretical framework, this study aims to answer the following three research questions.

RQ1. Which internet-mediated genres have been studied in the existing literature?

RQ2. What affordances have been considered in existing studies on internet-mediated genres?

RQ3. Which research methods have been used to study internet-mediated genres?

# METHODOLOGY

This section describes how we conducted this study. After describing how we chose our research methodology, it explains how we selected our samples, collected and analyzed data from them, and ensured the credibility and trustworthiness of the results.

Choice of Research Methodology We conducted an integrative literature review, which

reviews, critiques, and synthesizes the representative literature on a topic in an integrated way to generate new frameworks and perspectives on the topic. [43, p. 356]

A special characteristic of integrative literature reviews is that they let researchers systematically synthesize fields of inquiry empirically to

confirm established knowledge and establish best practice.

How Data Were Collected Our search commenced 2019 and continued into early 2020 to locate studies of internet-mediated genres that were published in peer-reviewed journals by the end of 2019. Informed by similar types of reviews [44], [45], we looked for empirical studies that conducted genre analysis of internet-mediated genres published up to 2019.

We selected keywords, including $[ \mathrm { T S } =$ ((digital OR electronic OR computer-mediated OR web OR internet OR online OR cyber OR “new media” OR email OR “social media” OR “social network∗ site” OR SNS OR forum OR blog OR microblog OR Twitter OR Facebook OR Weibo OR Instagram OR YouTube) AND (“genre analysis” OR “move analysis”))]. The first set of keywords denotes “internet-mediated”; “genre analysis” (covering rhetorical genre analysis and “move analysis” (covering rhetorical move analysis) refers to the empirical studies that closely analyze a collection o genre instances.

To ensure the quality of the review, we included only peer-reviewed articles written in English.

We searched for peer-reviewed articles in the Social Sciences Citation index (SSCI), the prestigious index for scholarly publications in social sciences that is the basis of academic reputations in many parts of the world, including the country in which two of the authors work.

The initial search yielded 63 results after eliminating all duplicated articles.

We performed a staged review by screening the author-provided abstracts of the 63 retrieved articles [43], using the following criteria to identify relevant articles:

Studies that address internet-mediated genres Studies that conduct genre/move analysis of internet-mediated discourse

Articles that did not meet these criteria—such as nonempirical articles and empirical studies on non-internet-mediated genres (which accidentally entered the initial list)—were excluded. We revised the inclusion and exclusion criteria through the abstract review process to ensure that we made the most reliable and sound decisions.

After completing the review of author-provided abstracts, we eliminated 28 articles, leaving 35 that met our criteria. We then reviewed the full texts of these 35 articles.

How Data Were Analyzed Once the final list of research samples was determined, we analyzed the studies as follows.

Two of the researchers read through the articles and coded them according to the theoretical framework (see Fig. 1) and definitions introduced above. Specific characteristics of articles that were coded include the following.

• Bibliographic information automatically retrieved by Web of Science, such as author, title, journal, year published, volume and issue numbers, and pages   
• The name of the genre given by the original researcher(s), such as sales email, online fashion shopping site, or research blog   
• The specific internet medium that mediated the examined genre, classified as email, website, or social media   
• The communicative goal of the genre determined by the original researcher(s), such as direct marketing, customer service, or retail transactions   
• Research method(s) reported by the original researcher(s), classified into quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods   
• Affordances—We inspected which and how medium affordances were addressed in each article. Because the terms affordances, multimodality, hypertextuality, and functionality might not be employed in the article, we followed the following approach to coding: • Multimodality—When an article analyzed both the linguistic and visual features of a genre, we assigned them to the category of studies on “multimodality.” Then, we recorded the semiotic modes addressed in the research article, including language(s), pictures, emojis, and videos. • Hypertextuality—We recorded whether the research articles addressed any hypertextual elements, such as hyperlinks/links, and navigation menus. • Functionality—We recorded whether the research articles addressed any issues associated with the functionality of the medium studied, such as navigating, commenting, replying, and liking.   
• Key findings, as reported in the article’s Results or Discussion sections   
• Implications, as reported in the Results or Discussion sections

Whenever possible, we used the content and terminology used in the original articles to code. For example, the name of the genre of Lam’s work [41] was coded as “internet group buying deals,” extracted from the title of the article. Similarly, the communicative goal of the genre was coded as “convincing potential buyers to purchase the item advertised in the deal,” according to the following sentence in the article’s literature review section: “As a predominantly promotional genre, internet group buying deals have the overriding rhetorical purpose of convincing potential buyers to purchase the item advertised in the deal.” [p. 15].

The two researchers who coded the articles then met to review their coding. They agreed on approximately $8 7 \%$ of the assessments. When there were divergent assessments, the coders negotiated with each other until they reached agreement.

Then, we explored patterns in the data to reach broader generalizations and conclusions.

Assuring Credibility and Trustworthiness To minimize the effect of bias on our study, we took several measures. First, although the first author took the lead in choosing literature for the study, all decisions were reviewed by the third author to ensure a second opinion on all decisions. Second, we used dual coding, meaning that two of the three authors individually coded all of the data and then discussed any divergent assessments until we reached consensus. Third, the study was audited by the second researcher.

# RESULTS

This section presents the results of the study. After describing the general characteristics of the sample of articles included in the review, this section provides answers to the research questions—first within each class and subclass of genres identified within the sample, then across these classes.

The 35 articles included in this study were published between 2005 and 2019, and steady publication volumes (more than one article per year) began in 2013. The 14 source journals in our sample are multidisciplinary, ranging from communication and linguistics, to cultural studies and information science. Four of the journals published more than one article, including Discourse, Context & Media (10), Journal of Pragmatics (8), English for Specific Purposes (4), and IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION (2). The other journals published

![](img/123811804ba3a28bc50755ccdda520bcb12418187c9fe9cd1b0de17d54c343b2.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Numbers of email, website, and social media genres studied (2005–2019).

only one article: Iberica, World Englishes, Revista Espanola de Linguistica Aplicada, Discourse Studies, Written Communication, Information Research, Library & Information Science Research, International Journal of Cultural Studies, and International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning.

Based on the media of the genres covered by the articles in our sample, the 35 articles were divided into three media-differentiated categories, as follows:

Private email genres (4 studies) - Public website genres (17 studies) - More dynamic social media genres (14 studies)

If we divide the publications into three time periods, as illustrated in Fig. 2, we can see that email genres received apparently less academic attention after 2010, while website and social media genre studies have gained increasing popularity since 2010.

Email Genres Emails refer to messages sent privately among users through the internet. Although the first messages consisted of text only, as the speed and capacity of the internet has expanded, so have the functionality of emails, which can now include text, graphics, links, videos, and audio recordings, and to which documents can be attached.

What email genres have been studied in existing literature? In the 2000s, researchers have probed corporate use of emails for commercial sales and customer care. More specifically, researchers have studied the use of emails for the following:

- Direct marketing [46], [47] Unsolicited, promotional spams [48] - Company replies to customer inquiries [49]

What affordances have been considered in existing studies on email genres? Given the primarily linguistic nature of email communication, the analytical components in the studies of email genres were language-centered (see Table I). Three of the studies also explored hypertextuality in the move structure schemes, looking specifically at hyperlinks in emails that pointed to further information [46]–[48]. Yet, none of the four studies on email genres [46]–[49] mentioned how emails’ technical functions, such as cc (carbon copy) and attachment, contributed to the discursive construction of communicative goals.

What research methods have been used to study email genres in existing literature? All four studies conducted move analysis, employing either mixed methods (two studies) or qualitative methods (two studies) to identify the typical discourse structures of the email genres.

Website Genres A website is “a set of pages of information on the internet about a particular subject, published by a single person or organization” [50]. One might think of the general concept of a website as more like a book or a newspaper: a type of publication. Similarly, just as books and newspapers are characterized by several genres, so are websites.

What website genres have been studied in existing literature? Within website genres, we identified two subclasses, which are as follows:

Web 1.0 content (12 studies), that is, officially published content by website developers Web 2.0 content (5 studies), that is, user-generated reviews and comments (see details in Table II)

Compared to Web 1.0 content, Web 2.0 content was explored less from the perspective of genre. This finding could result from the fact that the former was often produced for professional or institutional purposes—that is, within or closer to the sphere of academic interest in conventional genre studies—while the latter, as comparatively new communicative behavior facilitated by the internet, was mostly generated by ordinary users for personal purposes, and thus has drawn relatively less academic attention so far.

Web 1.0 Content Genres Based on its main communicative goals, Web 1.0 content can be considered in the following broad genres:

Marketing, sales and customer support   
News   
Scholarly and academic

Marketing, sales, and customer support sites are intended to promote products, facilitate purchases, and respond to questions and concerns that arise during and after purchases. Most organizations integrate all of these functions into a single website, but researchers tend to focus on just one or two of them when studying this genre. More specifically, researchers have studied

A fashion shopping site [51]   
Advertisements for digital products on retailers’ websites [52] Customer complaint forms on corporate websites [53]   
Group buying deals [41]   
Book blurbs on e-commerce websites [54]

News sites report noteworthy and recently received information, especially about currently occurring events [55]. News was one of the first uses envisioned for the internet, and was the focus of the earliest internet services, such as Prodigy,

America Online, and Yahoo. Researchers have studied the following types of online news genres:

- General online news galleries [56] - Celebrity news [57]

Scholarly and academic sites refer to websites that address the needs of faculty and students in higher education institutions, and are intended to facilitate the exchange of knowledge. Researchers have studied specific aspects of sites focused on facilitating the exchange of knowledge, including the following:

Video methods articles [58] Virtual special issue introductions [59] Open science notebooks [60] The Article of the Future project [61] Internet postings on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) websites [62]

What affordances have been considered in existing studies on Web 1.0 content genres? Among the 12 studies on officially published Web 1.0 content, two were on an entire webpage or website, five on purely textual genres, two on textual-pictorial genres, two on pictorial genres, and one on video genre (see details in Table II).

A few researchers investigated a whole webpage or website as a genre, explicating how website affordances facilitate communicative purposes. In her examination of internet group buying deals, Lam found that language, visual elements, hyperlinks, and website functions were combined to achieve the communicative purpose in each move [41]. In the move “Introducing the title,” for example, the titles were introduced both verbally (written in larger font) and visually (showing the details of the product in vivid and pleasing ways). Hyperlinks usually took the form of visual elements, such as an arrow or icon. Functions on the websites, including purchasing, discussing, and social media sharing, were enabled by hyperlinks. Andersen and van Leeuwen analyzed a fashion shopping site at macro and micro levels to show how genres of everyday face-to-face interaction move online [51]. At the macro level, the principal menu navigated viewers through the entire website. At the micro level, the fashion shopping site was home to seven micro genres: orientation, catalog, product information, purchase, fashion magazine, lifestyle magazine, and street style photography.

Promotional discourses for products, such as books and digital devices, were ubiquitous on shopping websites. The analyses of promotional genres were conventionally language-centered, focusing on the discourse structure and lexico-grammatical features. In Labrador et al.’s study [52], multimodality was embedded in Step 4 (illustrating the product with a picture) in their study of online advertisements.

The digital and online nature of websites has been breeding new academic genres, which are afforded by multimodal, hypertextual, and functional choices. Perez–Llantada compared the Article of the Future (AofF) prototypes on an academic website with a corpus of journal articles [Journal Article Corpus (JAC)], demonstrating the similarities and differences between them [61]. Though the AofF prototypes adhered to the JAC texts, as governed by the long-established communicative purposes of the genre, the website provided new affordances to the AofF prototypes, including graphical abstracts (multimodality), interactive graphs (multimodality and functionality), embedded videos (multimodality), and hyperlinks (hypertextuality), which brought greater potential for generic change. Similarly, Hafner looked into the video methods article, published online by the Journal of Visualized Experiments, which drew on the affordances of digital videos to facilitate wider audiences to academics, and multimodal academic writing [58].

Pictorial genres on news websites have been investigated by two researchers. Online news galleries are new forms of journalism integrating visual and verbal pieces [56]. For example, the study demonstrated that bios, one of the emerging genres, presented a chronological series of photos of a famous figure in visually salient positions, accompanied by captions that describe the photos, placing the name or title of the figure in clause-initial positions. In such pictorial genres, language was considered in subordination to the visual image.

What research methods have been used to study Web 1.0 content genres in existing literature? Researchers approached purely textual genres mainly through quantitative move analysis, sometimes with corpus tools (see details in Table II). The textual-pictorial genres, in which pictures were complementary to the texts, were analyzed largely as textual genres. The webpage/website pictorial genres and the video genre received qualitative multimodal analyses. For instance, Lam quantitatively analyzed 100 internet group buying deals through a synthesis of discourse analytic, corpus linguistic, and social semiotic approaches [41]. Andersen and van Leeuwen provided a cartography of an online fashion shopping site, complemented by an eye-tracking experiment [51].

Web 2.0 Content Genres Web 2.0 sites allow ordinary users to review, comment on, rate, and vote on news, products, services, and other topics of interest.

What Web 2.0 content genres have been studied in existing literature?: Researchers have explored the following user-generated reviews:

News discussion [63]   
Book reviews [64]   
Hotels’ responses to customer reviews [65]   
Product reviews [66]

What affordances have been considered in existing studies on Web 2.0 content genres? As demonstrated in Table III, all of the studies acknowledged the fact that the commenting, reviewing, and replying functions of the websites are the prerequisites for Web 2.0 content genres, while purely linguistic issues were considered in most studies. For example, Zhang and Vásquez investigated 80 hotels’ responses to online reviews on TripAdvisor, and found that businesses replied to consumer-generated reviews in a highly formulaic and conventionalized manner, with thanking and apologizing among the most frequently used moves [65]. Other types of modality, such as special punctuation marks and emoticons, were included as genre traits—for example, in Huang et al.’s study, to distinguish commercial from noncommercial internet book reviews [64].

What research methods have been used to study Web 2.0 content genres in existing literature? Most studies on Web 2.0 content genres applied mixed method to conduct move/genre analysis, some with corpus methods (see details in Table III). In addition to genre analysis, Huang et al. also conducted an online survey and an in-depth interview to establish judgment criteria [64].

Social Media Genres Social media refers to web and mobile sites that let users create and share content with one another, and comment on the content. Social media cover a wide range of internet-based applications, including (but not limited to) blogs, social networking sites, and content communities [68]. In our study, two

subtypes of social media genres were identified, called, respectively, “blog genres” (five studies) and “social networking sites genres” (nine studies).

Blog Genres The term “blog” is shortened from the full term, weblog, and

is an online journal or informational website displaying information in the reverse chronological order, with latest posts appearing first. It is a platform where a writer or even a group of writers share their views on an individual subject. [69]

Blog genres can be categorized according to the blogger’s profession, or a specific theme.

What affordances have been considered in existing studies on blog genres? Researchers focused on the typology and discourse structure of blog genres, while the nonlinguistic affordances were mentioned as contextual information [70]–[74]. For instance, Luzon showed that “meaning is constructed through the integration of different genres, modes, and even languages” [70, p. 24]. A research group blog post may contain a set of embedded genres, ranging from abstracts, book covers, and bionotes to PowerPoint slides, YouTube lectures, and pictures from newspapers (multimodality); and link to scholars’ homepages, Wikipedia entries, and social media platforms (hypertextuality). Based on the prototype theory, Lehti examined the innovative ways of genre-mixing in politicians’ blogs [71]. Eighty French politicians’ blogs were divided into five subgenres: diary, scrapbook, notice-board, essay, and polemic. Diary blogs, for instance, informed the public of the politician’s private life

and political work, and promoted a positive image of the politician. The author indicated that in the blogs, links to government websites were provided (hypertextuality) and comments were received from the public (functionality) in the image construction process.

What research methods have been used to study blog genres in existing literature? Blog genres were approached linguistically mainly through mixed methods (see details in Table IV). In addition to genre instances, some researchers also collected data from people. For example, Luzon conducted a grounded-theory analysis of 345 posts taken from 13 Spanish research group blogs, complemented by online questionnaire responses from the bloggers [70].

Social Networking Site (SNS) Genres Social networking sites (SNS) are websites or apps “designed to help people communicate and share information, photographs,” and other information with a group [75]. The top 10 social networking sites by market share are Facebook $( 3 6 . 6 4 \% )$ , YouTube $( 2 7 . 0 1 \% )$ , Twitter $( 6 . 8 2 \% )$ , Reddit $( 5 . 1 0 \% )$ ), Instagram $( 2 . 4 7 \% )$ , Pinterest $( 1 . 9 5 \% )$ , LinkedIn $( 1 . 5 8 \% )$ , Quora $( 1 . 2 9 \% )$ , Tumblr $( 1 . 1 6 \% )$ , and Yelp $( 1 . 0 3 \% )$ [76]. In our sample, scholars have researched the most popular social networking sites: Facebook [77]–[79]; the professionally oriented LinkedIn [80]; the photo-sharing site Instagram [81], [82]; the video-sharing site YouTube [83]; the microblogging platform Tumblr [84]; and the Chinese mobile messaging application WeChat [42].

What affordances have been considered in existing studies on SNS genres? Despite the fact that the SNSs afford abundant multimodal resources,   
hypertextual choices, and interactive functions, the analyses of SNS genres were largely monomodal, language focused, and linguistics oriented. For example, Bremner and Phung looked into the   
rhetorical structure of LinkedIn summaries,   
showing that even though the structure was not rigidly organized, they shared many moves in   
common with job application letters, with the   
additional move of personal   
branding [80].

In several studies, the medium affordances were mentioned as contextual information. For example, Vásquez and Creel looked into Tumblr Chat posts as a newer social media discourse genre for conviviality, attention, and circulation, which supports multimodal and hypertextual options and combinations, from text, link, and photo, to audio, video, and GIF [84]. Instagram selfies have attracted more multimodal analyses. Mommy-blog selfies, sharing experiences and opinions about the everyday experience of motherhood, are emerging as a visual genre [81]. Using two popular Instagram tags, #motherhood and #momlife, Zappavigna and Zhao [81] conducted an SFL-based multimodal analysis of mommy-blog selfies on Instagram, and categorized them into four subgenres: presented, mirrored, inferred, and implied, which illustrate the different perspectives of the photographers.

What research methods have been used to study SNS genres in existing literature? SNS genres were analyzed qualitatively in most studies, ranging from genre analysis and discourse analysis, to conversation analysis, thematic analysis, multimodal analysis, and critical genre analysis (see details in Table V).

# CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

This section concludes the study. It first puts the results into context, then identifies limitations of the study, and closes by suggesting future research that would build on these findings.

Conclusion Rooted in a three-fold theoretical framework of medium, affordances, and communicative goal, this study integrated 35 internet-mediated genre studies published in SSCI-indexed journals between 2005 and 2019. Three main types of internet-mediated

genres—email, website, and social media—and several subtypes (such as Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, blog, and SNS) were characterized by the media and communicative goals. The results indicate that media and communicative goals were explicitly explained and analyzed in all of the sample studies. In contrast, affordances were either treated monomodally, mentioned as contextual information, or integrated into the analytical framework. Researchers relied on a variety of methods to study internet-mediated genres, with mixed methods most common, followed by purely qualitative methods.

As shown in Table VI, language use was analyzed in most studies (except three pictorial genres) because they adopted linguistic-oriented genre theories. In nine studies—one on email, four on websites, and four on social media genres— researchers approached the internet-mediated genres monomodally, such as through purely linguistic perspectives, focusing on move structure, rhetorical strategies, and linguistic features as in traditional language-centered genre analysis. Eleven studies—four on website genres and seven on social media genres—mentioned other types of affordances as contextual information, but the analyses were still language-centered. Fifteen studies—three on email, nine on websites, and three on social media genres—integrated other affordances into their analytical frameworks in implicit or explicit ways. Six studies—three on email, two on website genres, and one on SNS genre—embedded affordances into the move structure scheme, by highlighting hyperlinks pointing to further information, pictures illustrating products, and photographs depicting a university campus. When analyzing an entire website or webpage, researchers tended to pay special attention to all of the affordances by incorporating multimodality, hypertextuality, and functionality explicitly into their analytical frameworks. Four studies on pictorial genres on websites and social networking sites, given their nonverbal nature, were approached mostly multimodally.

In analyzing the research methods used in these 35 studies, we found that 21 of them used mixed methods, and the remaining 14 were qualitative (see Table VI). In studying genres quantitatively, the studies usually counted the frequencies and percentages of each move or step in their descriptions of move structure. In our sample, email genre studies were evenly divided between qualitative and mixed methods. Mixed methods prevailed in studies on website genres (approximately $7 6 \%$ ), while social media genres were analyzed more qualitatively (nearly $5 7 \%$ ). Move analysis was applied in four email, eight website, and three social media genre studies. Corpus linguistic tools were applied in six website genre studies to analyze the concordance of

linguistic feature and annotate moves/steps. Nvivo, a qualitative analytical tool, was used in two social media genre studies to identify new genre patterns. Published more recently, the analytical approaches to investigating website and social media genres were significantly more sophisticated than those on emails. This finding, to a certain extent, reflected the methodological development in internetmediated genre studies. It also suggests that methods for studying internet genres continue to evolve and become more precise as more comprehensive tools for conducting the research become available.

Implications This integrative literature review indicates that previous studies have successfully introduced linguistics-based genre theories and methods into research on internet-mediated genres, and has generated meaningful and practical findings. The studies have made significant contributions both theoretically and empirically to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of conducting genre analysis on internet-mediated communication.

Through the theoretical framework constructed for this integrative literature review, we have recognized the trajectory of development of previous internet-mediated genre studies, which naturally and apparently align with the changes of times and technologies. The linguistic features, discourse structures, multimodal strategies, and especially the application of affordances in diverse practices of internet-mediated genres deserve to be explicated by practitioners and instructors on professional, technical, and business communication. And the patterns of empirical findings and methodological development found through this integrative literature review may

provide theoretical and methodological implications for future studies.

Limitations As with all research, certain limitations affect this study. One is the requirement that only studies published in journals covered by SSCI were considered for this review were required to have been. Other empirical studies of internet-mediated genres that were not included in this prestigious index were not included in our study.

Similarly, the study was limited by the terms used to search for literature. As with material in indexes other than SSCI, relevant studies could exist but were not found by the approach to the search used in our research.

Suggestions for Future Research Existing studies of internet-mediated genres still leave much room for future explorations. This article has shown that most studies tend to focus on genre instances, while more creative and technical methods of data collection and data analysis could be adopted. To enrich perspectives on internetmediated genres, for example, researchers could triangulate data resources by collecting data from genre producers and consumers to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the professional practice and communicative effect of a genre.

Also, future studies could probe into larger variety of internet-mediated genres bred in diversified professional practices and cutting-edge internethosted applications. In addition, one salient advantage of collecting data from internet-based media is the vast amount of data available online. It is now possible to collect large amounts of data more conveniently and efficiently.

Although many studies investigated in this article used qualitative methods to generalize patterns and theoretical structures, future studies could adopt more quantitative approaches to analyze larger amounts of data to test the generalizability of previous findings and assumptions.

Moreover, several other questions could be explored in future research.

How do the unique rules and policies of internet-hosted applications affect the type of content considered appropriate as a “genre”? How do we distinguish human-created and computer-generated genres? How do the supported personas of social media applications correlate to genre consumers?

Finally, the theoretical framework constructed in this study could be further tested to see its practicality and applicability. More deliberate efforts to develop internet-mediated genre studies both theoretically and methodologically may discover more ways of adopting genre perspective to enrich our understanding of internet-mediated communication.
