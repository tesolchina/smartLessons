Recognizing that graduate students seldom have the opportunity to participate collaboratively, either in providing or receiving feedback to improve their academic writing skills, this study reports on the design of a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) system used to investigate how graduate students transform and construct their academic knowledge through peer feedback when involved in summary writing. A sample of 24 graduate students who studied English as a foreign language was grouped into experimental and control groups, 13 and 11 graduate students in each group. The results of this study reveal that integrating the three key elements of a CSCL system facilitated improvement in the experimental group's summary writing. These key elements included (1) acquiring a basic understanding of main ideas by requesting keywords as scaffolds, (2) explicitly observing more proficient peers' writing processes when providing and receiving peer feedback (knowledge transformation), and (3) solving writing problems by revising their own summaries following peer feedback (knowledge construction). Based on the three key elements, the graduate students in the experimental group made more local (i.e., grammatical) and global revisions (i.e., text development, organization, and style) on their own as well as their peers' summaries, compared with the graduate students in the control group. The effectiveness of online peer feedback on summary writing, in transforming and constructing academic knowledge, is further discussed in this study.

# 1.Introduction

Graduate students who study English as a foreign language (EFL) are commonly required to read a large quantity of texts and transform their academic knowledge into writing by publishing papers. In transforming knowledge into writing, writers must be able to summarize texts, paraphrase, and use appropriate quotations to support their arguments. The main purpose of academic writing is knowledge transformation and construction, where graduate students are encouraged to use source texts more substantively as a means to develop a larger theme or argument (Hirvela & Du, 2013). Summary writing is a useful strategy to assist graduate students in going beyond the given knowledge by creating links between their prior knowledge and the new information (Hood, 2008; Mayer, 1984). Through summary writing, graduate students use their prior knowledge to identify main ideas in passages, transform these ideas through text organization, and integrate them in their own words to construct new academic knowledge. The practice of summary writing can help graduate students apply previously learned academic knowledge into their research. In summary writing, graduate students are expected to read source texts effectively to identify the most important information and then rewrite the texts, while maintaining a degree of similar meaning (Hirvela, 2004). Graduate students have to determine what content in a passage is most important and transform it into succinct statements in their own words, thereby writing a summary. When reading research articles, they form a mental understanding or higher level representation of what they have read (Brown, Day, & Jones, 1983; Kintsch, 1998; Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978), develop a text-specific organization to transform their understanding (Flower & Hayes, 1980; Taylor & Beach, 1984), and integrate important ideas into a written text by constructing logical relations for recall and comprehension (Leopold, Sumfleth, & Leutner, 2013).

# 1.1. Transforming and constructing academic knowledge through collaborative peer feedback

Collaborative learning is the key to knowledge transformation and construction (Tannenbaum & Tahar, 2008; Vygotsky, 1978). With collaboration, graduate students may develop improved social and communication skills, engage in critical thinking and information sharing, and achieve a deeper understanding and longer term retention of learned material (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). Roschelle and Teasley (1995) define collaborative learning as "the mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to solve the problem together' (p. 70). Through collaborative learning, graduate students become aware of higher levels of learning as they work together with others (HertzLazarowitz & Bar-Natan, 2002), and provide higher quality feedback and better decisions as they participate equally in online small group discussions (Janssen, Erkens, Kanselaar, & Jaspers, 2007). As such, graduate students in small groups get to know and understand one another, and are able to form a community of learning (Van Gennip, Segers, & Tillema, 2010).

Peer modeling and feedback are crucial elements in collaborative learning for summary writing (Min, 2005, 2006; Topping & Ehly, 1998). Peer modeling and feedback refers to the process where graduate students are able to observe their peers' thoughts, strategies, and actions, and allow for the transformation of their academic knowledge and language awareness (knowledge transformation) (Topping & Ehly, 1998). Peer modeling and feedback encourages collaborative learning, as graduate students learn to negotiate meanings through dialogue and interaction with peers (Chen, in press). With new developments in computer and information technology, online peer modeling and feedback is becoming more important than traditional written feedback since graduate students are more able to participate and become more responsible in their approach to summary revision tasks (Guardado & Shi, 2007). Through online peer modeling and feedback, graduate students are able to anonymously provide comments, while observing their competent peers' summary revision processes by viewing log files (Skalicky & Brown, 2009). The log files can be used to help students observe and compare their summary revisions with those of their more proficient peers (Yang & Meng, 2013). After receiving online peer modeling and feedback, graduate students can clarify any illogical sentences and text confusion, when constructing new academic knowledge by reorganizing their thoughts in reading and writing texts (knowledge construction) (Hovardas, Tsivitanidou, & Zacharia, 2014; Yang, 2014).

# 1.2. Statement of the problem

While previous studies have examined the benefits of peer feedback in improving students' reading and writing skills, few have focused on how graduate students transform and construct academic knowledge through online peer feedback when involved in summary writing. First, in traditional classroom settings, professors usually ask EFL graduate students to complete brief summaries after reading research articles. However, a basic understanding of academic texts is often not present in the surface structure (the exact wording) of the text (Lee, Wong, Cheung, & Lee, 2009; Friend, 2001). As such, many graduate students do not understand how to improve their academic writing since they have difficulties recognizing which content is most important (main idea identification) and how to paraphrase it into a summary with onsite instruction (Friend, 2001). Second, many EFL graduate students have little interaction with their peers and professors due to very limited onsite instruction (Chi, 2001). They are usually asked to complete their paper-based summaries in a short amount of time, receive general feedback from their professors, and revise very little for their summaries. As a result, many graduate students are unable to engage in the deep thinking necessary to grasp central ideas while reading texts and correcting grammatical errors when writing summaries. Finally, the cognitive process for writing summaries, which converts surface structure to the understanding of a text, is internal and largely unobservable in onsite instruction (Alfassi, 2004). Graduate students have little opportunity to interact and compare their own summaries with more proficient graduate students when transforming and constructing their academic knowledge into better written texts. All these indicate that academic knowledge transformation and construction can be aided by using online peer feedback, when students are involved in summary writing, and that it can contribute to improvement in graduate students' academic writing.

# 1.3. Background of this study

The purpose of this study was to investigate how graduate students transform and construct their academic knowledge through peer feedback in summary writing by using a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) system. In CSCL, keywords are defined as "a set of phrases semantically covering most of the text' (Ercan & Cicekli, 2007, p. 1705). In other words, keywords become an important scaffold when learning to write summaries. Ercan and Cicekli (2007) indicate that keywords can be considered as brief summaries of a text. In the process of knowledge transformation, online peer feedback is the information that is constructed through meaningful negotiation (Dekhinet, 2008). Graduate students are expected to become "writerly readers" (Hirvela, 2004) and critical thinkers as they collaboratively engage in providing and receiving useful suggestions and comments in transforming different perspectives (Yeh, in press). In this study, peer feedback refers to the provision and reception of summary revisions in an online environment. Revision can "increase student engagement and attention to detect and correct writing problems' (Ferris, 2003, p. 52). Two main types of summary revision are included, local (Cho & Schunn, 2007) and global (Hall, 1990) revisions (Appendix 1).

Local revision refers to the detection of grammatical errors in linguistics units of a word (e.g., spelling errors), phrase (e.g., incorrect singular or plural in phrases), clause (e.g., misuse of words in adjective clauses), and sentence (e.g., misuse of sentence structures) levels. Global revision refers to provision of feedback on text organization, readerbased perspectives, and clarity of purpose, including addition, deletion, substitution, reordering, and consolidation. Both local and global revisions are important prompts for graduate students to improve the revisions of their summary writing. In addition, this study adopted the Computerized Propositional Idea Density Rater (P-density) (Brown, Snodgrass, Kemper, Hermen, & Covington, 2008), which is a computer program designed to determine propositional idea density, to evaluate how students improve when writing summaries. Yang (2014) indicates that the use of the P-density rater may not only facilitate graduate students to extract main ideas, but also allows for an evaluation of their summary improvement by calculating keywords.

According to the research purpose of this study, three research questions were addressed: (1) What progress in reading do graduate students make after receiving online peer feedback in summary writing?, (2) What are the processes of knowledge transformation and construction attributed to online peer feedback when graduate students are involved in summary writing?, and (3) What are the graduate students' perceptions toward their progress in academic reading and writing in a CSCL environment?

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Participants

There were 24 graduate students studying EFL voluntarily participated in this study while attending a university of science and technology in central Taiwan. All were in the first year of a master's program of EFL teaching and business communication. The students were all enrolled in a graduate course entitled "English Grammar in Use", which aimed to deepen their knowledge of grammar and sentence patterns in academic reading and writing. Before instruction began, they were asked to take the reading section of the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) as a pre-test. The maximum score that can be attained in reading on this version of the TOEIC is 495, and the reliability of the TOEIC test is reported to be 0.90 (Chun Shin Limited, 2009). These 24 graduate students were then grouped into experimental and control groups based on their similar mean scores in the pre-test, with 13 and 11 graduate students assigned to the groups. The mean and standard deviation of the graduate students from the experimental group on the reading section of the TOEIC were 385.45 and 28.03 in the pre-test, while the mean and standard deviation of the graduate students from the control group were 387.62 and 26.58 in the pre-test. There is no significant difference between the two groups in the pre-test $( t ( 2 3 ) = 4 . 2 6 , p > . 0 5 )$

# 2.2. Research design

To externalize and record the graduate students' cognitive processes in academic writing, a CSCL system was developed for this study to investigate how the graduate students transformed and constructed academic knowledge while involved in summary writing and peer feedback. Two main modules comprise the CSCL system: the student interface and the teacher interface.

# 2.2.1. The student interface

The P-density measurement is based on Kintsch's propositional structure (Van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983) to evaluate improvement in students' summary writing by calculating verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions in the output of a computer program. For example, the sentence "Beyond Horizon is a good book"' becomes [IS: Beyond Horizon, BOOK] [GOOD: BOOK]. The rule of propositional analysis is [Verb: Subject, Object] and [Adjective: Object]. Verb usually plays a predicate, "IS", which identifies some properties of an object or some relations between two or more objects, "John and Mary" or "Beyond Horizon and book". The propositional representations preserve the meaning of the text, but not the exact wording and syntax (Leopold, Sumfletch, & Leutner, 2013). The words in bold found in Table 1 indicate the propositions detected by the P-density rater. The more propositions detected by the P-density rater, the higher the scores that are gained. In the peer feedback module, all of the graduate students are anonymous when reading peers' main ideas and summaries, and they then try to provide peers with feedback or comments on their first drafts to assist them in completing final revisions (see Figure 1).

# 2.2.2. The teacher interface

Teachers can monitor graduate students' interactions with their peers and their main idea identifications through the log files, while the graduate students write their summaries in the CSCL system. Different versions of the graduate students' summaries with peer feedback (local and global revisions) were recorded and shown in the log files. For example, in Figure 2, the student with account number 100117 gave the peer comment \*they do not rely on more expertise'. The students' interactions with their peers are recorded in the CSCL system for them to reflect on and improve their academic reading and writing skills.

# 2.3. Procedures of data collection

Transforming and constructing academic knowledge through peer feedback in summary writing incorporating the CSCL system lasted for 18 weeks. As the instruction began, two groups of graduate students were divided into experimental and control groups, with each receiving similar onsite instruction on how to read academic texts, write three summaries as first drafts for the expository texts, provide summary revisions as peer feedback, and finally revise their first drafts into final ones. The teacher first modeled how to read academic texts, grasping a basic understanding of the paragraphs and main ideas, and provided examples of local and global revisions to the graduate students in the first four weeks. Later, the graduate students in the two groups were asked to read academic texts, about 1500 words in length, and write summaries of at least 350 words as first drafts. In particular, the graduate students were encouraged to paraphrase sentences and reorganize their summaries so they were different from the original texts.

After 8 weeks of onsite instruction (3 hours per week), the graduate students of the experimental group were allowed to use online scaffolding strategies for keywords, online peer feedback, and P-density in the CSCL system for another 10 weeks (Figure 3). The teacher also participated in online summary tasks to provide students with feedback anonymously. The CSCL system automatically extracted high frequency and highly related semantic words for grasping key concepts in each paragraph to help further complete their summaries. For online peer feedback, the graduate students collaboratively interacted with peers by providing local and global summary revisions in the dialogue boxes to solve any writing problems. The P-density acted as an automatic assessment to evaluate the students' writing improvement after receiving peer feedback. The graduate students of the control group, unlike those of the experimental group, undertook paper-based peer feedback for making summary revisions to their first and final drafts. They neither explicitly observed interactions with their peers nor accepted scaffolding strategies for online keywords and automatic assessment of the P-density to revise their summaries.

Figure 3. Experimental design.

After 18 weeks of instruction, the two groups of graduate students were required to take a TOEIC post-test to examine if any reading progress had been made. The two groups of graduate students' local and global revisions were also compared to examine whether there was any improvement in their summary writing after receiving peer feedback. Their three summaries were further evaluated by the P-density after receiving peer feedback on local and global revisions. In addition, according to Yang's study (2011), two open-ended questionnaires were given to investigate the graduate students' perceptions toward academic knowledge transformation and construction through online peer feedback in summary writing, with comparisons made between the experimental (Appendix 2) and the control groups (Appendix 3).

# 2.4. Procedures of data analysis

Data collected in this study included the students' pre- and post-test scores, statistics between local and global revisions after receiving peer feedback, action logs from the CSCL system, and two open-ended questionnaires. First, a paired-sample $t \cdot$ -test was conducted to examine any progress in reading comprehension between the experimental and control groups comparing results from the pre- and post-tests. Second, summary revisions after peer feedback were analyzed by the researcher and the research assistant based on Cho and Schunn's (2007) and Hall's taxonomy of revision (1990) for the two groups. Third, the graduate students in the experimental group's original and final drafts were collected before and after peer feedback (local and global revisions) and further analyzed using the P-density. A high P-density rate would indicate the high quality of a graduate student's summary. The reliability of the P-density is reported to be 0.97 (Brown et al., 2008; Tsai, 2010, Yang, 2014). Finally, the graduate students' perceptions towards their progress in academic reading and writing following online peer feedback were analyzed by the content analysis of two open-ended questionnaires.

Four stages of content analysis were conducted in this study (Patton, 2002): coding, categorization, description, and interpretation. First, the researcher and the research assistant highlighted meaningful statements found in the open-ended questionnaires. Next, the meaningful statements were assigned into categories for each participant. The researcher then described the statements by summarizing the main ideas and interpreted the main ideas by offering explanations, drawing conclusions, and making inferences. The interrater reliability of the two open-ended questionnaires, the agreements between the researcher and the research assistant, was 0.85 by using Pearson correction to calculate the ratings for pairs of raters. Any disagreement between the two raters (the researcher and the research assistant) was resolved through discussion. Data interpretation driven by these research methods is further explained in the following sections.

# 3.Results

To investigate how the graduate students transformed and constructed academic knowledge using online peer feedback in summary writing, the results were described in three sections: (1) the graduate students' reading progress in the two groups; (2) the graduate students' local and global revisions of the paired-sample $t$ -tests of the two groups; (3) the process of transforming and constructing academic knowledge through online peer feedback in summary writing; and (4) the graduate students' perceptions toward their progress in academic reading and writing.

# 3.1. The graduate students' progress in reading comprehension of the two groups

The graduate students of the experimental and control groups were encouraged to provide and receive peer feedback in writing summaries to enhance their academic writing. A paired-sample $t { \cdot }$ -test was conducted in order to investigate the graduate students' reading progress of the two groups between the pre- and post-test scores after receiving peer feedback and summarizing strategies. The mean reading scores for the 13 graduate students of the experimental group on the TOEIC post-test (407.55) was greater than that of the pre-test (385.45). There was a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-tests in reading $( t = - 6 . 8 1 , p < . 0 1 )$ . The medium effect size was also found to be $\mathrm { E S } = 0 . 5 9 )$ . In contrast, the graduate students of the control group on the TOEIC posttest score (400.36) showed that they also made reading progress compared to the pre-test (387.62). A slight difference in scores between the pre- and post-tests was found $( t =$ $- 2 . 6 2 , p < . 0 5 )$ . There was a small effect size between the pre-and post-test scores ( $\mathrm { E S = }$ 0.27). The students of the experimental group made improvement when they received online keywords to grasp main ideas in each paragraph, online peer feedback, to provide and receive useful summary revisions, and P-density to evaluate the quality of their summaries.

# 3.2. Graduate students' summary revision types of the two groups

In this study, the paired-sample $t \cdot$ -test was employed to investigate the transformation and construction of academic knowledge when involved in online summary writing and peer feedback. As shown in Table 2, the types of local revision were compared between the experimental and control groups' final drafts after receiving peer feedback. The graduate students of the experimental group made significantly more revisions in word $( t ( 1 2 ) = - 3 . 1 5$ $p = . 0 2 \mathrm { , }$ and in sentence $( t ( 1 2 ) = - 1 . 5 5$ $p = . 0 5$ ) types, compared to other revision types in their final drafts. In contrast, the graduate students of the control group did not make many local revisions in their final drafts after receiving their peers' paper-based feedback. The results of the global revisions are represented in Table 3. For the graduate students of the experimental group, they made great improvement in substitution $( t ( 1 2 ) = - 3 . 1 1 , p = . 0 2 )$ , reordering $( t ( 1 2 ) = - . 4 8 , p = . 0 5 )$ , and consolidation $( t ( 1 2 ) = - 2 . 7 3 , p = . 0 3 )$ revisions as they accepted online peer feedback. There was a statistically significant difference in substitution for the control group's final drafts after receiving paper-based peer feedback $\operatorname { \Delta } t ( 1 0 ) = - . 3 8$ $p = . 0 5$ . The graduate students of the experimental group made significant progress on detecting and correcting errors on substitution, reordering, and consolidation for their final drafts, since they were encouraged to observe and learn from more-proficient peers' global revisions online. They were able to solve their writing problems by revising their summaries after receiving online peer feedback. In contrast, the graduate students of the control group lacked the opportunity to observe each individual's work on local and global revisions in terms of the restrictions of paper-based peer feedback.

# 3.3.1. The control group and onsite instruction

Among the graduate students of the control group, student A was selected to show her academic reading and writing improvement with peer feedback and summarizing strategy instruction on the paper-based worksheet (Figure 4). In each summary task, students were randomly assigned to correct one peer's summary. For example, student A read the academic text "Your Job in 2030-Beyond formal education", and identified the main and supporting ideas in each paragraph, and wrote her summary. Afterwards, she invited one of her peers to review her summary and provide her with some suggestions in written form. Finally, student A read her peer's suggestions and wrote her final draft.

Figure 4. Student A's paper-based worksheet of summary.

According to student A's first and final drafts on the paper-based worksheet, there was no explicit process to reveal how student A identified the main and supporting ideas from each paragraph. As such, she might have encountered difficulties in integrating the main and supporting ideas of each paragraph into a summary. She was also unable to observe how her more proficient peers revised their summaries and constructed new academic knowledge. The teacher also had difficulties in providing student A with further scaffolding without monitoring her process in identifying main ideas for writing summaries.

# 3.3.2. The experimental group and online instruction

The experimental group's summary writing in the CSCL environment is described in three respects in this study. First, student B was one of the graduate students randomly selected from the experimental group to represent her online interactions with peers. She was asked to read the same English expository texts and revise summaries from first drafts to final ones. Second, student B's reciprocal and extended interactions with her peers were externalized based on the dialogue boxes and action details in the CSCL system. Finally, the effects of online peer feedback and summarizing strategy on the 13 graduate students' summary improvement were presented with their P-densities after they read three academic texts.

# Final draft (P-density $= 5 3 \%$ -

(1) Small business easily promotes to global market through the Internet.   
(2) Many youth no longer see their future by receiving formal training or developing structured career.   
(3) For example, a young man made games and earned a salary which is equivalent to graduates over five months.   
(4) Because of the increasing of the tuition fees and traditional course design, more and more young people bult their expertise through Internet forums,where they can deliver new skills and collaborations.   
(5) Although it is easier to maintain a one-man business, one should develop different expertise such as marketingaccounting and sales skillseither through formal training or using the Intenet in this competitive market.

As shown in her final draft (Table 4), student B actively participated in collaborative interactions by reading peers' summaries and providing peers with her suggestions. After completing her first summary draft, she received four peers' feedback for global revisions. Peer D indicated that the first sentence was copied from the source text and should be paraphrased, and peer E mentioned that the second sentence should be reorganized with logical sequence. Other peers stated that detailed information should be added. The results show that student B could revise her summary first drafts to final ones and clarify illogical sentences in terms of receiving useful summary revisions. She further mentioned "While I had more chances interact with my peers and observed more-proficient peers' summary revisions, I could clarify illogical sentences and text misunderstanding, and my comprehension could be enhanced. This helped me revise my own summary".

In addition, student B's interactions in the online summary cycle could be identified (see Figure 5). In the process of giving and receiving peer feedback, student B actively gave four peer comments (to Graduate students C, D, E, and H). While these four students received feedback from student B, they also gave feedback to student B. After receiving peer feedback, student B reviewed her peers' main idea identifications and summaries as references to revise her own summary for enhancing academic writing competence. This finding indicated that the students of the experimental group made summary improvement in terms of receiving online keywords, observing more capable peers' main ideas and summary revisions, and receiving and providing peer feedback for summary writing.

Based on the calculation of P-density for each of the first and final draft summary writings, the results of the 13 and 11 graduate students in the experimental and control groups, respectively, are shown in Table 5. The graduate students of the experimental group made significant progress in their summaries while reading academic texts. The mean score of the 13 graduate students' P-density in summaries increased from $52 \%$ in text 1 to $69 \%$ in text 3. In contrast, there was no significant difference for the students of the control group, since the mean score of the 11 P-density summaries only increased from $45 \%$ in text 1 to $52 \%$ in text 3. As the graduate students in the control group did not receive online keywords, compared with their more-proficient peers' summarizing revisions through log files, and accepted different peers' feedback for improving their summaries, they could not construct new academic knowledge and clarify illogical sentences and text misunderstanding.

# 3.4. The graduate students' perceptions toward their progress in academic reading and writing

To explore the graduate students' perceptions toward their progress in academic reading and writing, two open-ended questionnaires were completed. Three main aspects of the questionnaires are highlighted. First, the graduate students' perceptions toward the important role of summarizing strategies are presented. Second, the process of transforming and constructing academic knowledge using online summary writing and peer feedback are described. Finally, the graduate students' perceptions toward onsite and online instruction in academic reading and writing are discussed further.

As shown in Table 6, most participants agreed that main idea identification and summarizing strategies were very important in helping them read and write academic texts. However, there were 16 participants $( 6 6 \% )$ who indicated that they had difficulties in writing summaries since they could not decide which information was important, and there were 13 participants $( 5 4 \% )$ who noted that identifying main ideas was very difficult since they were not familiar with the use of words in different contexts. They might identify incorrect main ideas since they misunderstood the word meaning in different contexts, even though they had consulted with the online dictionary. As student K stated "some vocabulary or terms are too difficult for me to acquire information from the academic articles". To overcome their difficulties, the participants tried their best to re-read the passages several times and examine their peers' summaries to enhance their reading comprehension.

In Table 7, the students of the experimental group $( 9 2 \% )$ appreciated being able to share feedback with their peers in the CSCL system since they could transform their academic knowledge through reading each other's summaries and comments to improve their own writing. Ten participants $( 7 8 \% )$ noted that they could review more-proficient peers' summary revisions for comparing and improving their own summaries, by clarifying illogical sentences and text misunderstanding for the enhancement of new academic knowledge. However, there was one participant who indicated that he could not get much help from peer feedback because his peers merely focused on grammatical or typographical errors. In the control group, 10 participants $( 9 1 \% )$ proposed that they received only one or two peers' suggestions and could not respond to their peers' comments in paper-based feedback. Two participants also claimed that they could not observe other peers' summaries and summary revisions in onsite instruction.

(3) I cannot observe other peers&#x27; summaries and their summary revisions in onsite instruction..</td><td>6 2</td></tr></table></body></html>

Compared to onsite instruction, most of the participants in the experimental group $( 9 2 \% )$ considered online peer feedback to be better at providing them with chances to view peers' ideas and thoughts on writing summaries (see Table 8). In contrast to the limitations of time necessitated by onsite instruction, online instruction had no limitations of time and space. Eleven participants $( 8 4 \% )$ stated that they had checked the online system regularly to see whether feedback had been posted by their peers. Online instruction helped the participants to overcome many difficulties in writing summaries. They claimed that it reduced their writing anxiety $( 7 6 \% )$ . Particularly, they were afraid of "losing face" or being embarrassed during face to face discussions when providing conflicting feedback to their peers. As student Q said I paid attention to my politeness when interacting with peers online because I was afraid of offending peers".

# 4.  Discussion and conclusion

The results of this study indicate that the graduate students could transform their academic knowledge by providing and receiving useful summary revisions to clarify illogical sentences or text misunderstanding through online peer feedback (Gielen, Peeters, Dochy, Onghena, & Struyven, 2010; Loewen & Erlam, 2006). Based on the theory of collaborative learning, previous studies concerning peer feedback and summary writing were complicated, internal, and unobservable in onsite instruction without the record of graduate students' actions in detail (Yang, 2011). The scaffold of log files in the CSCL system helped the teacher and graduate students to externalize and visualize their actions in connection with main idea identifications, summary writings, interactions with peers, and improvement in summary writing from first to final drafts. The graduate students could also examine the process by which their more proficient peers identified main ideas, wrote summaries, and compared their peers' summaries with their own.

The results correspond to the findings of previous studies (Gielen, Peeters, Dochy, Onghena, & Struyven, 2010; Loewen & Erlam, 2006; Yeh, in press) showing that transforming and constructing academic knowledge through peer feedback can improve graduate students' reading comprehension and academic writing skills by applying a summarizing strategy. The findings of this study revealed that the graduate students of the experimental group made greater improvement in academic reading and writing compared with those graduate students of the control group, in terms of receiving online scaffolding strategies of keywords and more summary revisions. The graduate students of the experimental group were able to observe and learn from their more-proficient peers in providing and receiving peer feedback in online summary instruction. That is, they could read their log files in the CSCL system to overcome their reading and writing problems as well as learn how to write a summary.

The findings also indicate that transforming and constructing academic knowledge through online summary writing and peer feedback helps graduate students raise their language awareness and critical thinking. By providing and receiving useful summary revisions from peers, the graduate students were able to recognize the key elements in well-organized academic texts, as well as, clarify illogical sentences and text misunderstanding. Tracking from student A and student B from the control and experimental groups showed that student A made few summary revisions from first to final draft, because she did not make collaborative efforts in the peer-review process, take scaffolding strategies of keywords, and observe more-proficient peers' log files to solve her reading and writing problems. In contrast, student B received the scaffolding strategy of keywords, provided and received four peers' feedback to improve her summary, and observed more-proficient peers' summary revisions for further improving her quality of summary writing.

Finally, from the open-ended questionnaires, most students confirmed that a summarizing strategy was beneficial to transform and construct new academic knowledge through continually re-reading and revising summaries while receiving online peer feedback in local and global summary revisions. In order to improve the quality of academic writing, the graduate students of the experimental group had to develop an understanding of the role they took in the CSCL system. As the experimental group had opportunities to provide and receive online peer feedback in the learning community, they took the responsibility of the role and learned about others' perspectives. Viewing summaries from the perspective of others, they were more easily able to understand and identify their peers' dilemmas, feelings, and motives. The graduate students, however, still had to face some challenging tasks in writing summaries. Some graduate students hesitated to revise their peers' summaries because they were not confident with their own suggestions or comments.

Some limitations were also found in this study. First, as only 24 participants took part in this study, the sample size was not large enough to generalize EFL graduate students' collaborative interactions in summary writings and reading comprehension. The findings of this study might not be able to fully illustrate the interactions in learning English for Academic Purposes classes. Second, the teachers' perceptions toward the effects of peer feedback on summary improvement in the CSCL system should be further explored. An interview or an open-ended questionnaire could be utilized to investigate the teachers' perceptions toward the effectiveness of the system in supporting peer feedback in academic reading and writing.
